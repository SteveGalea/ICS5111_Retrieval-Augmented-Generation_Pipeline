{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) it affects approximately 0.24% of the population in the united states and Canada. most common symptoms are sensory loss (paresthesias), motor spinal cord symptoms (numbness or weakness in one or more limbs), autonomic spinal cord symptoms (bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction) genetic and environmental factors are important for the etiology of MS (184). it is known that some major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes, as well as some alleles of cytokines and their receptors increase the risk for MS. a low vitamin D level in early childhood leads to a decrease in the expression of HLA-DRB1*15 in the thymus. as a consequence, more autoreactive T cells could emerge in the immune system of people who had low vitamin D in their early childhood. a higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 is detected in MS patients in Scandinavian countries compared with those in Mediterranean countries. microglial cells are resident macrophages of the CNS. microglial cells carry out active CNS tissue scanning (187) microglial cells carry out active CNS tissue scanning (187) microglial cells may become classical phagocytic cells. oligodendrocytes are cells that provide support and insulation for axons. a single ODC can extend its processes to approximately 50 axons. endothelial cells and pericytes are constituents of small BVs within the CNS. if a T cell expresses CD4, it recognizes MHC class II molecules. most of the T cells express exclusively CD4 or CD8, and are designated as CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. a certain proportion belongs to regulatory T cells (Treg) CNS contains other semi-professional APC (microglia, B cells, and endothelial cells) and non-professional APC (astrocytes), which can reactivate autoreactive T cells (12, 38, 109, 440) the activation of CTL and B cells and the maturation of T cells. T cells expressing TCR that recognize self-antigens are produced in the immune system. in the process of maturation, such T cells are eliminated or inactivated by mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. central tolerance is based on the interaction between TCR and MHC. T cells that recognize antigens in an inadequate manner could be eliminated or become anergic. a nave T cell can be activated only if it receives simultaneous stimulation through TCR, co-receptors, and cytokines. some of the major molecular targets in the immune response in MS are identified. axo-glial proteins, such as neurofascin and contactin-2, are also important molecular targets in MS. microbes may be involved in the primal activation of encephalitogenic T cells. microbial and self-antigens are microbial products that activate many clones of T cells. superantigens are microbial products that activate many clones of T cells. a superantigen is not recognized by T cells in a classical way. autoreactive T cells exist in the immune repertoire but are no guarantee for the induction of immune response against the CNS components. it was shown, about 30 years earlier, that peripheral blood of healthy individuals contains T cells that are specific for myelin antigens (e.g., MBP) (63). the frequency of myelin-reactive T cells in the blood of healthy individuals is not increased compared with that of healthy controls (44). the immune privilege of the CNS is based on the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB), which regulates the transport of molecules and cells between systemic circulation and CNS parenchyma. the entrance of immune cells into the VRS is not considered classical infiltration. CNS, macrophages and activated T cells of any specificity are capable of passing BBB and BCSFB and entering the CNS. in general, the transport of antibodies and cells from immune organs and tissues into the CNS is impaired due to the BBB and BCSFB. there are no classical lymphatic vessels that drain brain and spinal cord. soluble and cellular drainage from the CNS to lymph organs is essential for the initial steps of inflammation seeded within the CNS. a very important characteristic of the CNS, which contributes to the immune privilege, is the limited presentation of antigens within the CNS. active immunosuppresion performed by CNS resident cells, predominantly astrocytes and neurons, is an important factor of the immune privilege. astrocytes provoke apoptosis in activated T cells in Fas-FasL dependent and independent manner, down-regulate proinflammatory cytokine generation in these cells, and even induce Treg (318). the credibility of EAE as an MS model has been increasingly criticized. many agents that proved to be beneficial in EAE are inefficient or even detrimental in MS. theiler's murine encephalitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) has been intensively used as a model for human demyelinating diseases, including MS (119, 300). TMEV-IDD presents a parallel to a possible scenario in humans, where the initial trigger for CNS inflammation and demyelination is a virus. ingestion of cuprizone by mice leads to early ODC death, the activation of microglia/macrophages, and subsequent reversible demyelination. this model is particularly useful for studying demyelination and remyelination, and their relation to axonal loss. the most common is the relapsing\u2013remitting course (RRMS) in patients. flare-ups of neurological disabilities occur from time to time, followed up by a complete or partial recovery. the most common is the relapsing\u2013remitting course. MGAT1 (IVAVTT) and CTLA-4 (Thr17Ala) converge in order to alter branching of glycans. importantly, branching reduction results in T-cell hyperactivity and promotes spontaneous inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration in the MS animal model. a higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 is detected in MS patients in Scandinavian countries compared with those in some other non-European countries. many elements of its complex pathogenesis are still unknown, and there are no medications for curing the patients with the disease. redox processes have a critical role in all stages of MS, particularly in the first\u2014the initiation, and the last\u2014the neurodegeneration. microglial cells are resident macrophages of the CNS. microglial cells carry out active CNS tissue scanning (187) microglial cells may become classical phagocytic cells. they provide an optimal physical and metabolic environment for neuronal activities. T cells initiate and propagate an autoimmune response against the CNS. they orchestrate cellular and humoral effectors, which attack myelin, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. the essential signal for T-cell activation comes from the recognition of antigens presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. macrophages and neutrophils will not be properly engaged in adaptive immunity without the contribution of Th cells. perivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus macrophages are present in healthy CNS (375) central selection takes place in the thymus. there, T cells commit to CD4 or CD8 lineage. T cells that recognize foreign peptides are adequately stimulated. in the complex with MHC molecules present in the thymus, such T cells will be eliminated in the process of negative selection. ideally, after positive and negative selection, nave T cells generated in the thymus should be able to interact with MHC molecules that express foreign, but not self-antigens. if recognition is too long, a T cell will be eliminated in the process of activation-induced cell death (AICD) if the recognition lasts too long and/or is too intense, a T cell will be eliminated in the process of activation-induced cell death. microbes may be involved in the primal activation of encephalitogenic T cells. molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander activation are shown. the examples of possible contribution of microbes to the activation of self-reactive T cells are presented. clonal, or polyclonal activation, some autoreactive T cells may be activated. some superantigens that are relevant for MS, as well as chains of TCR that they bind to are listed. immune cells have to pass EC, EBL and PBL of BBB or EC, EBL, EpC, and EnC of BCSFB. the immune privilege of the CNS is based on the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB) which regulates the transport of molecules and cells between systemic circulation and CNS parenchyma. perivascular space is limited by endothelial basal lamina and glial basal lamina. the entrance of immune cells into the VRS is not considered classical infiltration. macrophages and activated T cells of any specificity are capable of passing BBB and BCSFB and entering the CNS. there is a special interest in the ability of APC to leave the CNS. there is no direct connection between CNS parenchyma and lymph nodes. there is a special interest in the ability of APC to nest into lymphatic organs. microglia appears to be essential for the activation of CD8+ T cells. astrocytes provoke apoptosis in activated T cells in Fas-FasL dependent and independent manner, down-regulate proinflammatory cytokine generation in these cells. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used model of MS. it is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that is actively induced in susceptible animals by immunization with CNS-specific antigens. the disease can also be provoked by transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells, obtained from draining lymph nodes of animals immunized for active EAE induction into the syngeneic animals. lination rarely occurs in EAE; and (v) in most EAE variants, CD4+ cells are the major culprits. some other immune cells might have pathogenic predominance in MS. many agents that proved to be beneficial in EAE are inefficient or even detrimental in MS (36). the non-human pathogen has been used in a model for a human disease. it has been reported that a specific type of encephalomyelitis in humans might be caused by a human-TMEV recombinant virus (272) it has been shown that TMEV-IDD is especially important for studies of epitope spreading and molecular mimicry. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used model of MS. it is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that is actively induced in susceptible animals by immunization with CNS-specific antigens, peptides derived from these antigens. the disease can also be provoked by transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells into the syngeneic animals (transfer or passive EAE) many agents that proved to be beneficial in EAE are inefficient or even detrimental in MS (36). new EAE variants are also emerging, and they are exploring aspects of MS that were previously unaddressed in animal models. TMEV-IDD is of particular interest, because it presents a parallel to a possible scenario in humans. a specific type of encephalomyelitis in humans might be caused by a human-TMEV recombinant virus (272) it has been reported that TMEV-IDD is especially important for studies of epitope spreading and molecular mimicry. TMEV-IDD is especially important for studies of epitope spreading and molecular mimicry. the earliest time at which patients can be diagnosed for MS is during the first clinical episode, that is, CIS, which best correlates to a newly developed focal lesion(s) 18. this is further accompanied by macrophage-mediated myelin removal, BBB breakage, and potential inflammation (381). the authors suggested early events in lesion initiation may be followed by the immigration of activated lymphocytes. they observed virtual absence of T and B cells in early lesions. the formation of early lesions has some basis other than destructive cell-mediated immunity directed against a myelin. patterns I and II involve the autoimmune component and resemble EAE. patterns III and IV do not comprise autoimmunity, at least not in early stages of lesion development. authors identified pattern III lesions mostly in patients who had a clinical course of less than 8 weeks before the biopsy or autopsy took place. a widespread characteristic of MS patients, which appears to be present before the disease onset, is the obstruction of cerebral circulation. a significant role of circulatory defects in initiation is implicated by the fact that early lesions (and lesions in general) often develop around veins. a subgroup of adult and pediatric patients showing MS signs has been identified. the symptoms are usually alleviated by iron supplementation (446) this can be easily explained by the high amount of iron needed for normal ODC development and function. a decrease in cerebral blood flow by roughly 50% and more than twofold prolonged mean transit time of blood throughout the NAWM of MS patients. however, these changes, observed during the course of disease progression, could be secondary. NO and H2O2 may leak into the perivascular space to affect astrocytes. the smooth muscle layer is thick and non-homogenous around small postcapillary veins. it does not represent a significant barrier for NO and H2O2 to reach astrocytes. shear stress also increases the activity of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) on endothelial cell membranes (150), which leads to superoxide (\u2022O2) production. superoxide is dismutated to H2O2 by CuZnSOD. NO and H2O2 from endothelium activate the redox cycle in astrocytes NO and H2O2 are capable of drastically altering the intracellular redox milieu. a number of studies substantiate the development of redox changes in MS lesions, involving nitrosative and oxidative stress. complexes I, III, and IV lead to increased \u2022O2 production (333). the production takes place even under physiological conditions, being drastically increased. NF-B activates the expression of a number of genes, two of which encode redox active enzymes. iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) have \u2022O2 as a by-product. the increased level of active iNOS within the CNS is next to zero. the expression of iNOS in astrocytes most likely represents a key step in MS initiation, leading to further NO-provoked inhibition of ETC. the decrease of NADH/NAD+ ratio Probably the most important pathophysiological consequences are indirectly provoked by ONOO. PARP catalyzes the cleavage of NAD+, which leads to a decrease in the NAD+ level and an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio (15). a high NADH/NAD+ ratio is known to act as the strongest stimulus for \u2022O2 production in mitochondria (on ETC complex I) the increased production of \u2022O2 in complex I results in further H2O2 leakage from mitochondria. eductase 1, nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal were observed only in astrocytic mitochondria (444) this implies that ETC is obstructed only in astrocytes, while macrophages generate ROS in the intracellular compartment and on the membrane. the expression of many AOS enzymes is regulated by nuclear factor-E2-related factor (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. the involvement of macrophages/microglia in the development of the initial lesion is strongly implicated by the available data. oxHDL exerts toxic effects on cultured CNS cells and promotes inflammation (138); so, these structures may be involved in the mechanisms of initial lesion formation. astrocytes cause the death of ODC by producing excessive amounts of NO on iNOS. astrocytes represent the source of nitrosative stress, because they have low antioxidant levels, a high content of iron (redox active metal) and exposed extensive plasma membranes. neurons are also known for their weak AOS, but their axons acquire protection from myelin sheets. oxidative/nitrosative burst unleashed by the astrocytes leads to ODC death. iron may bind NO in order to form dinytrosil-iron complexes (442) in vitro study showed that HNE provokes ODC death at concentrations as low as 2 M (151). however, the accumulation of HNE may obstruct the remyelination by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of ODC precursors (151). a number of studies documented the presence of myelin-laden macrophages in early/pattern III lesions. the density of perivascular macrophages gradually increases along the vascular tree, from capillaries to postcapillary venules. the loss of metabolic support may lead to myelin fragmentation even in the absence of macrophages. astrocyte foot processes are placed around the blood vessels, contributing to the formation and function of BBB. astrocytes may not be capable of properly supporting the integrity of BBB at the site of lesion formation. altered redox settings may lead to a release of a number of TJ/BBB-affecting agents into perivascular space. MMP-2 and MMP-9 cleave occludin and dystroglycan receptors. this leads to destabilization of TJ and astrocyte end-feet anchorage to parenchymal membrane. IL-17-induced BBB disruption involves NOX- and xanthine oxidase (XO)-mediated \u2022O2 production and consequent down-regulation of occludin (213). the intracellular \u2022O2 production in endothelial cells appears to suppress the expression of junction adhesion molecules, ZO1, claudin-1, and occludin (476). NO, HNE, H2O2, and \u2022O2 are released into the perivascular space from astrocytes, endothelium, and macrophages. this provokes the TJ to lose its structure and integrity. MMP-mediated cleavage of collagens and elastin results in the destruction of lamina. it has been proposed that MS pathogenesis involves primary degenerative changes that may (or may not) result in a host's aberrant immune response. a gate opens to the damaged tissue emitting specific signals and showing epitopes that the immune system is not familiar with. it should be emphasized that MS may take a benign course even after the development of the autoimmune component (94, 284) s in MS is substantiated by the work of Zhang et al. (491) and Bahbouhi et al. (28) they showed that there is a population of T cells memorizing a wide-spectrum of myelin-related antigens in the blood of MS patients. a multi-epitope-targeting strategy is required for effective immune-specific therapy for MS. the level of neuroketal-modified proteins showed a positive correlation with the amount of antibodies against lipid peroxidation-modified proteins in CSF. the presence of anti-SNO-Cys antibodies that target S-nitrosylated proteins was documented in the sera of MS patients and in an EAE model. neuroketal-adducts, nitrosylated-peptides, or citrullinated-MBP (citrulline being the product of iNOS activity) are necessary in order to push MS over the edge of autoimmunity. ROS and RNS damage myelin and disturb homeostatic functions of astrocytes, microglial cells, and ODC progenitors. redox processes involved in initial myelin degradation are important for activation and reactivation of T cells (A) or for the reactivation of T cells (B) they are also involved in the modification of antigens, and in epitope spreading that is important for the perpetuation of autoimmunity. antigen processing and presentation by MHC class I and MHC class II molecules are spatially distinct in cells. leakage of antigens processed by MHC class II machinery into MHC class I pathway occurs in the process of cross-presentation (310). Activated T cells will differentiate into effector and memory T cells. activated CD8+ T cells target myelin, ODC, and neurons via lytic mechanisms. redox instability leads to ODC and myelin damage and BBB dysfunction. an additional pathway of autoimmunity initiation, which also involves redox misbalance within the CNS, is plausible. around 20% of patients at first showing signs of cortex demyelination/inflammation were diagnosed for CIS and did not develop MS (284) correale et al. observed the presence of newly formed inflammatory lesions in benign MS cases at 10+years' follow-up (94) antibody down-regulates the production of soluble VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. expression of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells is regulated by NF-B. endothelium promotes selective recruitment of effector T cells. CCL3 is known to promote the chemotaxis and infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells into CNS (420, 430) it has been reported that CCR5 is involved in the modulation of CD8+ T-cell activity, but that it is not essential for the entry into the CNS. myelin fragments promote the expression of VCAM-1 and CCL2 in endothelial cells. NO exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing VLA-4 expression in endothelial cells. this leads to increased production of CCL20 and decreased expression. thiol groups in chemokine receptors may be important for fine tuning the signaling properties of the receptors. they can be altered by S-nitrosylation or oxidation, the first process being probably more important for decreasing the infiltration. the infiltration can be drastically promoted when the Th17 phenotype is reached. the ability of Th17 cells to activate IL-17-provoked BBB disruption (60, 475) may be particularly important for the development of new inflammatory lesions in the previously unaffected brain regions during the course of MS. a subpopulation of effector memory CD8+CD161+ T cells which release IL-17 and express CCR6 receptors has recently been detected. studies show that autoaggressive T cells infiltrate the CNS in order to induce MS-like pathology in experimental animals. however, until recently, there have been no reports showing significantly increased presence of lymphocytes in early lesions. memory T cells may enter CSF in the subarachnoid space across the choroid plexus epithelium (244) or via transvascular route (34) the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells has been identified in the CSF of MS patients, non-inflammatory neurological disease patients, and even in healthy CSF. 5- H2O2 reacts with iron in the CSF. the reaction is promoted by asc or \u2022O2, which reduce the product form of iron back to reactive form - Fe2+. 7- CTL invade the cortex via damaged pia mater. CSF shows lower levels of iron-binding proteins and several-folds higher concentrations of ascorbate (Asc) in comparison to plasma (78, 190, 409) the reaction of iron with H2O2 (Fenton reaction) can be easily boosted during meningeal inflammation by \u2022O2 (via Haber\u2013Weiss reaction) or by Asc (62, 409), and some CSF metabolites also. the cortex is the CSF-adjacent tissue, separated from the T-cell containing medium (CSF) only by one thin membrane (pia mater) this makes the cortex a site that may be more prone to the soluble mediators of inflammation (ROS, RNS, and cytokines) and to T-cell infiltration comparing with white matter. white matter lesions in PPMS show pattern IV (283, 366), which is mostly related to degenerative processes and may the earliest time at which patients can be diagnosed for MS is during the first clinical episode, that is, CIS, which best correlates to a newly developed focal lesion (18). the earliest time at which patients can be diagnosed for MS is during the first clinical episode, that is, CIS, which best correlates to a newly developed focal lesion(s) phagocytic activity in nascent MS lesions represents a response to pathological alternations on myelin sheets developing due to a loss of metabolic support by ODC (33). the authors suggested that these early events in lesion initiation may be followed by the immigration of activated lymphocytes. lesions show no evidence of T- or B-cell infiltration. the root cause of MS is not immune deregulation, but a set of very specific degenerative processes (417) patterns I and II involve the autoimmune component and resemble EAE. patterns III and IV do not comprise autoimmunity, at least not in early stages of lesion development. a widespread characteristic of MS patients, which appears to be present before the disease onset, is the obstruction of cerebral circulation. a significant role of circulatory defects in MS initiation is implicated by the fact that early lesions (and lesions in general) very frequently develop around veins. a subgroup of adult and pediatric patients showing signs that appear to be provoked by iron deficiency has been identified. a subgroup of adult and pediatric patients showing MS signs that appear to be provoked by iron deficiency has been identified. authors attributed the results to hemodynamic and vascular alterations (404) obstructed venous blood flow may be present before the onset of MS. a decrease in cerebral blood flow by roughly 50% and more than twofold prolonged mean transit time of blood throughout the NAWM of MS patients. however, these changes, observed during the course of disease progression, could be secondary. endothelial cells produce increased amounts of vasoactive agents. nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may leak into the perivascular space to affect astrocytes. the smooth muscle layer is thick and non-homogenous around small postcapillary veins. eNOS-deficient mice exhibit a delayed onset of EAE. shear stress also increases the activity of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) on endothelial cell membranes (150) NO, HNE, and H2O2 leak from astrocytes and macrophages. an increased level of NO provokes caspase-3 inhibition and ONOO formation in ODC. a set of side-reactions takes place in astrocytes, ODC, and macrophages. NO may provoke the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I, III, and IV. the production takes place even under physiological conditions. it is important to note that inhibition was not present in pattern II lesions. the depletion of IB kinase (which is essential for NF-B activation) in astrocytes, but not in ODC, was sufficient to protect the mice from myelin loss. the increased level of active iNOS within the CNS is next to zero. the injection of arginine into the rat brain provokes demyelination (248) the expression of iNOS in astrocytes most likely represents a key step in MS initiation, leading to further NO-provoked inhibition of ETC. the decrease of NADH/NAD+ ratio Probably the most important pathophysiological consequences are indirectly provoked by ONOO. a high NADH/NAD+ ratio is known to act as the strongest stimulus for \u2022O2 production in mitochondria (on ETC complex I) the development of interdependent redox loops in the course of MS pathogenesis is implicated by the fact that nanomolar affinity PARP inhibitor PJ-34 suppresses iNOS expression. perivascular or myelin-laden macrophages show increased levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase, NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1, as well as nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. this implies that ETC is obstructed only in astrocytes, while macrophages generate ROS in the intracellular compartment and on the membrane. oxHDL-like particles could be released from astrocytes and macrophages under prooxidative settings in initial lesions. the particles may integrate into membranes of other cells in order to activate a lipid peroxidation-chain reaction (15), thus disseminating oxidative damage. oxHDL exerts toxic effects on cultured CNS cells. astrocytes expressing syncytin (human endogenous retrovirus glycoprotein) provoke death of ODC by producing excessive amounts of NO on iNOS. astrocytes represent the source of nitrosative and oxidative stress. astrocytes appear to be relatively resistant to ONOO (220) neurons are also known for their weak AOS, but their axons acquire protection from myelin sheets. iron may bind NO in order to form dinytrosil-iron complexes (DNIC) or it may react with H2O2 to produce a highly reactive \u2022OH radical, which is buffered by myelin lipids. ODC are particularly susceptible to HNE, a major bioactive lipid peroxidation product. the reported HNE concentration (4 M) appears to be more than sufficient to kill ODC according to the findings of an in vitro study. a number of studies documented the presence of myelin-laden macrophages in early/pattern III lesions. the density of perivascular macrophages gradually increases along the vascular tree, from capillaries to postcapillary venules. myelin-laden macrophages represent an anti-inflammatory acting component of the immune system. astrocyte foot processes are placed around the blood vessels, contributing to the formation and function of BBB. astrocytes may not be capable of properly supporting the integrity of BBB at the site of lesion formation. altered redox settings may lead to a release of a number of TJ/BBB-affecting agents into perivascular space. MMP-2 and 9, NO, HNE, H2O2, and \u2022O2, all of which may affect TJ and BBB. cleave occludin receptors, which leads to the destabilization of TJ and astrocyte end-feet anchorage to parenchymal membrane. IL-17-induced BBB disruption involves NOX- and xanthine oxidase (XO)-mediated \u2022O2 production and consequent down-regulation of occludin (213). occludin-ZO1 and occludin--catenin complexes appear to suppress expression of junction adhesion molecules, claudin-1, and occludin (476). MMP-2 and MMP-9 cleave occludin and dystroglycan receptors. this leads to the destabilization of TJ and astrocyte end-feet anchorage to parenchymal membrane. the effects being, most likely, mediated by increased NO production. this benign MS appears to develop in approximately 30% of patients (365) however, the process transcends to the next phase, which involves primary degenerative changes that may (or may not) result in a host's aberrant immune response. a gate opens to the damaged tissue emitting specific signals and showing epitopes that the immune system is not familiar with. phagocytosis of necrotic cells promotes maturation of DC (389) there is a population of T cells memorizing a wide-spectrum of myelin-related antigens in the blood of MS patients. a multi-epitope-targeting strategy is required for effective immune-specific therapy for MS. a recent study found increased levels of carboxymethylated and neuroketal-modified proteins in the CSF of MS patients. the level of neuroketal-modified proteins showed a positive correlation with the amount of antibodies against lipid peroxidation-modified proteins in the CSF. this suggests that this adduct may have a role of antigen in MS (172). myelin-based highly-antigenic molecules are necessary to push MS over the edge of autoimmunity. the development of autoimmunity in MS is a consequence of redox changes in the CNS. ROS and RNS damage myelin and disturb homeostatic functions of astrocytes, microglial cells and ODC progenitors. microbial antigens are presented to CD4+ and CD8+ cells by DC in the lymph node. redox processes involved in initial myelin degradation are important for activation and reactivation of T cells (A) or for the reactivation of T cells (B) redox changes also contribute to its shift into chronic autoimmunity. antigen processing and presentation by MHC class I and MHC class II molecules are spatially distinct in cells. leakage of antigens processed by MHC class II machinery into MHC class I pathway occurs in the process of cross-presentation. Activated T cells will differentiate into effector and memory T cells. proinflammatory mediators released by microglia compromise immunosuppressive activity of the CNS resident cells. activated CTL that are specific for CNS antigens both directly and indirectly target myelin, ODC, and neurons via lytic mechanisms. redox instability leads to ODC and myelin damage and BBB dysfunction. around 50% of examined patients showed signs of cortex inflammation and/or demyelination, involving the activity of CD8+ T cells and myelin-laden macrophages. a combination of ODC's non-apoptotic death and macrophage dysfunction may have a crucial influence on the further steps in MS initiation, that is, induction of autoimmunity. the presence of a number of different products of myelin that become antigens in MS is substantiated by the work of Zhang et al. (491) and Bahbouhi et al. (28) there is a population of T cells memorizing a wide-spectrum of myelin-related antigens in the blood of MS patients. a recent study found increased levels of carboxymethylated and neuroketal-modified proteins in the CSF of MS patients. the level of neuroketal-modified proteins showed a positive correlation with the amount of antibodies against lipid peroxidation-modified proteins in the CSF. the presence of anti-SNO-Cys antibodies that target S-nitrosylated proteins was documented in the sera of MS patients and in an EAE model. the findings strongly imply that the fragments of nervous tissue or myelin are not sufficient to provoke an autoimmune response in multiple system atrophy (461). the findings suggest that the fragments of nervous tissue or myelin are not sufficient to provoke an autoimmune response in multiple system atrophy. antigens are presented to CD4+ and CD8+ cells by DC in the lymph node. microbial antigens are presented to CD4+ and CD8+ cells by DC in the lymph node. redox processes involved in initial myelin degradation are important for activation and reactivation of T cells (A) the presentation of antigens by DC to nave autoreactive CD8+ T cells depends on the process of antigen cross-presentation. however, leakage of antigens processed by MHC class II machinery into MHC class I pathway occurs in the process of cross-presentation. proinflammatory mediators released by microglia compromise immunosuppressive activity of the CNS resident cells. activated CD8+ T cells also produce various cytokines and other mediators which sustain neuroinflammation. redox instability leads to ODC and myelin damage and BBB dysfunction. around 50% of examined patients showed signs of cortex inflammation and/or demyelination, involving the activity of CD8+ T cells and myelin-laden macrophages. correale et al. observed the presence of newly formed inflammatory lesions in benign MS cases at 10+years' follow-up (94) anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (natalizumab) down-regulates the production of soluble VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. endothelium promotes selective recruitment of effector T cells (215) regulation of expression involves NF-B (55, 237, 304, 462, 492) in the initial lesion, prooxidative processes and up-regulated NF-B expression in astrocytes and other cells may promote the infiltration of T cells. the release of CXCL12 and CCL20 from astrocytes in MS lesions has been documented. the severity of EAE is reduced in CCR2-knockout animals (434) it has been shown that MBP induces CXCL12 expression in astrocytes but not in endothelial cells (72) altogether, this implies a very direct involvement of myelin fragments in the promotion of inflammation in (initial) lesions. some chemokine receptors include extracellular Cys residues with free thiol groups. the mutation of these residues in CCR6 drastically suppresses chemotaxis of T cells. it has been proposed that thiol groups in chemokine receptors may be important for fine tuning the signaling properties of the receptors. it is also known that CXCL12 shifts Th1 cells toward Treg cells (309) and that it induces apoptosis in activated T cells (298). the ability of Th17 cells to activate IL-17-provoked BBB disruption (213) may be particularly important for the development of new inflammatory lesions in the previously unaffected brain regions during the course of MS. autoaggressive T cells infiltrate the CNS in order to induce MS-like pathology in experimental animals. however, until recently, there have been no reports showing significantly increased presence of lymphocytes in early MS lesions. Lucchinetti et al. proposed that macrophages carrying fragments of myelin may leave the cortex and spread epitopes to lymph nodes. it has been proposed that memory T cells may enter CSF in the subarachnoid space across the choroid plexus epithelium or via transvascular route (34). the reaction is promoted by asc or \u2022O2, which reduce the product form of iron - Fe3+ back to reactive form - Fe2+. 5- H2O2 reacts with iron in the CSF. IL-17 from T cells affects BV and provokes BBB disruption. perivascular and submeningeal infiltration of T cells into the CNS of an EAE model have been observed (34); subpial cortical lesions are more frequent in early MS compared with the lesions formed around vessels (284); and (iii) CSF is significantly different fluid when compared with plasma, showing to be a more fertile ground for prooxidative processes. we propose that the early formation of cortical lesions involves different mechanisms compared with white matter lesions due to specific redox- and immune-relevant settings. the cortex is the CSF-adjacent tissue, separated from the T-cell containing medium (CSF) only by one thin membrane (pia mater) this makes the cortex a site that may be more prone to the soluble mediators of inflammation (ROS, RNS, and cytokines) white matter lesions represent the prevailing form of lesion in MS. in most cases, cortical lesions develop later, during progressive phases of MS (86), for example, during relapses in RRMS (66) or in SPMS (254, 358). redox processes in macrophages are overshadowed by the production of reactive species in astrocytes. iNOS and COX2 show a very interesting interplay. NO is known to promote COX2 catalytic activity. at high concentrations, NO inhibits COX2 activity and expression. myeloperoxidase (MPO) generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) due to its high reactivity, HOCl is considered as having a very limited diffusion radius in biological milieu. however, only a small fraction of HOCl produced in macrophages may find its way out and affect the surrounding tissue. macrophages have to produce \u2022O2 and H2O2 in order to conduct the process of myelin phagocytosis. inactive macrophages show a very low ROS production. NOX2 is a multi-subunit enzyme that is dormant in resting phagocytes. two superoxide radical anions can be dismutated to O2 and O22. the latter is protonated to H2O2. the main mediator of oxidative damage exerted on myelin fragments in phagosomes appears to be \u2022OH. the activation and proliferation of T cells require a tightly regulated redox microenvironment, which T cells sense by their cell-surface thiol redox switches. the stimulation of TCR activates CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to express NOX2, dual oxidase 1 (Duox1) and eNOS. enone, a well-known promoter of \u2022O2 production on complex I, suppresses the emission of H2O2 from mitochondria. mitochondria may lack ADP to continue ATP production. this leads to reverse electron transport from complex II toward complex I. intracellular H2O2 and redox switch affect gene expression. Treg remove Cys and thioredoxin, which reduces extracellular oxidized Cys to Cys. the release of TNF and IFN- from T cells appears to be promoted by H2O2. the suppression of effector T cells and the induction of Treg cells depend on extracellular ROS production, most likely for the purposes of self-regulation. extracellular Cys increases the level of reduced thiol groups on the exofacial membrane proteins of T cells, thus turning the redox switch on. in a co-culture with effector T cells, DC show enhanced GSH synthesis and the uptake of oxidized Cys (cystine; Cys-S-S-Cys) at higher H2O2 concentrations, redox switches remain \u201con\u201d but redox signaling is now activated. a further increase in H2O2 concentrations results in the oxidation of -SH to -SOH. in this form, redox switch(es) are (reversibly) off. the differentiation of Th17 cells may be hampered by NO-promoted development of Treg cells. however, experimental models of MS suggest that IFN- plays an antioxidative role in neuroinflammation. there is more oxidative stress in the CNS of EAE-immunized IFN-R knockout mice. central memory T cells retain a high capacity for proliferation. effector memory T cells subdifferentiate into classical memory B cells. rechallenging the immune system with an antigen will elicit a fast and strong response. the level of lipid peroxidation products, including oxidized low-density lipoproteins, is increased in the plasma and CSF of MS patients. oxLDL and ROS stimulate the generation of osteopontin (297), which plays a major role in MS pathogenesis (416), shifting Th differentiation toward pathogenic Th1 and Th17 phenotypes (177). vitagenes, Hsp, and sHsp operate in the brain in helping neuronal survival by performing folding and repair of damaged proteins, preventing aggregate formation and prooxidative/cytotoxic effects of free heme. the vitagene network in lymphocytes is up-regulated in MS (361), most likely to prevent self-inflicted oxidative damage. the most relevant appears to be Hsp70, whose role in MS is still controversial. if this fails, and large number of neurons and ODC undergo necrosis, a certain amount of Hsp70, sufficient to promote or exacerbate inflammation, could be released. the local concentrations of HspB5 may determine the balance between protective innate responses and destructive adaptive responses. in developing MS lesions, HspB5 is selectively induced as a protective protein in astrocytes, from which it is released in order to trigger microglia activation. pattern II lesions show an 8-fold lower level of oxidation and 1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower PARP activity compared with pattern III lesions (181, 453) inflammatory stimuli are known to activate the expression of iNOS and COX2 in macrophages. proanoids (COX2 products) and ONOO may contribute to cellular death in the lesions. cytosolic phospholipase A2-deficient mice are resistant to EAE (3). nitro-cholesterol linoleate (CLNO2) suppresses iNOS expression and inflammatory responses in macrophages. a key mediator of inflammation\u2014NO\u2014is involved in its eventual resolution. the key players in myelin degradation are \u2022OH, HOCl, and \u2022NO2. NOX2 is present on both cellular and phagosomal membrane. this results in a release of NO, H2O2, and \u2022O2 from macrophages. van der Goes et al. incubated macrophages with myelin and specific ROS scavengers. the removal of H2O2 by catalase, and the scavenging of \u2022OH by mannitol suppressed macrophage-mediated myelin phagocytosis. mannitol removal by exogenous CuZnSOD did not show any such effects. NOS in the cytosol, to produce ONOO and its derivatives\u2014\u2022OH and \u2022NO2. the latter suppresses the inhibition of proteases and binds to proteins, which become more susceptible to protease activity. this could be very important for myelin degradation. Williams' group observed three distinct phases (pathways) of ROS production: (i) rapid (2\u20134 min after stimulation) and transient production of H2O2 independent of NOX2; (ii) NOX2-dependent, sustained H2O2 production; and (iii) NOX2-independent \u2022O2 production (221) the same research group found that the early H2O2 production (first phase) in stimulated CD4+ T cells is mediated by intracellular Duox1 (255 production in stimulated T cells is twice as high at cell\u2013cell contacts than in the cytoplasm. the stimulation activates H2O2 production by mitochondria and Duox1. eNOS is expressed in mitochondrial and cellular membrane (particularly in the vicinity of TCR) the intracellular production of H2O2 is needed for T-cell activation. it has been reported that the radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can inhibit T-cell activation. it should be noted that GSH peroxidase-deficient CD4+ T cells proliferate at a faster rate compared with wild-type cells. Gelderman et al. showed that NOX2 activity increases the threshold of reactivity and suppresses proliferation of T cells by provoking oxidation of specific thiol groups (-SH) on T-cell membranes. the treatment with oxidized GSH (GSSG) leads to decreased number of reduced thiol groups on the membrane surface by forming -S-SG moieties. the nature of redox switch(es) on T cells remains to be further elucidated. it is clear that ROS and ROS-generating enzymes are involved in a complex signaling network which shows both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. redox switches remain \u201con,\u201d but redox signaling is now activated. at even higher H2O2 levels, -SH is further oxidized to -SO2H or -SO3H. cytokines may modulate redox settings and vice versa. differentiation of Th17 cells may be promoted by ROS generation in mitochondria (494) IL-17 collaborates with TNF in the induction of oxidative stress-dependent death of ODC (354). IL-17 induces BBB disruption through the induction of NOX- or XO-dependent ROS production (213). the number of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is increased in the peripheral blood of MS patients. these cells readily infiltrate the CNS and are found in MS lesions (25, 180, 243) memory B cells are also implicated in MS pathogenesis, not only through the production of autoreactive antibodies. vitamin D3 is important for the optimization of branching of asn-linked glycans. reduced branching results in T-cell hyperactivity and provokes inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration. oxidative stress may result in less restringent activation of autoreactive cells. vitagenes, Hsp, and sHsp operate in the brain in helping neuronal survival by performing folding and repair of damaged proteins. the vitagene network in lymphocytes is up-regulated in MS (361), most likely in order to prevent self-inflicted oxidative damage. released Hsp may act as immunomodulators, and some of them most likely play a rather important role in MS. the level of Hsp27 in MS patients is increased during the phase of disease progression (80). the induction of T-cell tolerance for Hsp60-derived epitope has been reported to ameliorate EAE (45) sHspB5 binds to antibodies due to its chaperone characteristics. fragments of sHsp may act as autoantigens. sHsp may act as autoantigens. insulating properties of myelin sheets enable fast, saltatory conduction of action potentials from one node of Ranvier to another. restoration comes at the cost of greater Na+ influx and increased activity of Na+/K+ ATPase. demyelinated axons show a 2\u20133-fold increase of mitochondrial density compared with normal tissue (288, 464) increased levels of lactate (glycolysis metabolite) have been detected in active MS lesions using MR spectroscopy (355) increased levels of glycolysis and polyol pathway have been detected in active MS lesions using MR spectroscopy. increased ATP production is not sufficient for coping with Na+ overload. the increased number of mitochondria and promoted glycolysis are not enough to meet energy demands of chronically demyelinated axons in the long run. the increased number of mitochondria and promoted glycolysis are not enough to meet energy demands of chronically demyelinated axons. one MRI study documented that Na+ level is up to twice higher in MS lesions compared with healthy tissue (218). a small Na+-channel blocking oligopeptide (600\u2013800 Da) was identified in the CSF of MS patients (24), most likely representing an adaptive factor aimed at decreasing Na+ inflow into demyelinated axons. direct interactions between myelin-reactive Th17 cells and demyelinated axons resulting in damage have been observed in EAE (403) acute axonal injury has been shown to be partially independent of demyelination (48) cortex comprises both myelinated axons and unprotected neuron somas and dendrites. this difference may be reflected in the process of neurodegeneration. neuronal injury, morphology changes, pyknosis and apoptosis, dendritic transection and loss of dendritic arborization are substantial in cortical lesions. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. activated T cells directly interact in an MHC-independent manner with soma and dendrites and provoke Ca2+ oscillations. this leads to a lethal increase in neuronal Ca2+ levels, which can be prevented by blocking glutamate receptors. death of soma directly results in axon dysfunction and slow disintegration. iron can coordinate six ligands in an octahedral arrangement. ligands that favor Fe3+ involve oxygen in iron binding. ligands that bind Fe2+ involve nitrogen and sulfur. we found increased prooxidative activity of inappropriately chelated iron in the CSF of patients suffering from a neurodegenerative condition. ligands that favor Fe3+ involve oxygen in iron binding, whereas ligands that bind Fe2+ involve nitrogen and sulfur. cuprizone is a copper-chelating agent which is applied in order to provoke MS-similar symptoms in animal models that are highly relevant for the investigation of pattern III and IV lesions (241). the mechanisms of cuprizone-activated demyelination are not fully understood, but they appear to involve metabolic stress in ODC and the activation of CXCR2+ neutrophils (276). demyelinated axons are highly susceptible to externally exerted oxidative/nitrosative stress. the main cause of degeneration seems to come from within the demyelinated axon. the remyelination capacity is diminished in chronic lesions so the axons remain permanently demyelinated. demyelinated axons show a 2\u20133-fold increase of mitochondrial density compared with normal tissue (288, 464) more mitochondria means more H2O2, as there is a constant outflow of H2O2 from mitochondria into the cytosol. the increase in NAD+ level in EAE animals shows neuroprotective effects (226), most likely by decreasing NADH/NAD+ ratio. brain appears to try to compensate for NAD+ decrease by de novo NAD+ synthesis, which leads to a decrease in the level of tryptophan (the precursor of niacin and NAD+) in CSF and serum. the increased number of mitochondria and promoted glycolysis are not enough to meet energy demands of chronically demyelinated axons in the long run. without enough ATP to power Na+/K+ ATPase, neurons suffer from Na+ accumulation, which leads to reverse action of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (97), Ca2+ import, and Ca2+-induced cell death. axons degenerate by \"slow burning\" in inactive chronic lesions with depleted remyelination capacity. inflammation may propagate neurodegeneration in white matter (403, 407) cortical demyelinating lesions are widely present in MS patients. cortical damage correlates with MS progression as well as with cognitive and other disabilities. cortical damage correlates with MS progression as well as with cognitive and other disabilities. tosis, dendritic transection and decreased density of neuronal somas and synapses are substantial in cortical lesions. axons appeared to be spared in archaeocortex autopsies of MS patients. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. axons of cultured human neurons provoke neuronal death via antigen- and MHC-independent mechanisms. this implies that the effects are based on direct cell\u2013cell interactions and/or the involvement of short-living species with a shorter diffusion range compared with cytokines. the importance of NO in cortical degeneration is implied by the decrease in the functional activities of ETC complexes I and III in mitochondria isolated from motor cortex of MS patients. axon-myelin or neuron\u2013ODC interactions and metabolic support are bidirectional. damage of neuronal body and axon may promote demyelination. white matter is the cause of degeneration, but it is clear that inflammation may propagate neurodegeneration. direct interactions between myelin-reactive Th17 cells and demyelinated axons resulting in damage have been observed in EAE (403) acute axonal injury has been shown to be partially independent of demyelination (48) cortical damage correlates with MS progression as well as with cognitive and other disabilities. cortex comprises both myelinated axons and unprotected neuron somas and dendrites. neuronal injury, morphology changes, pyknosis and apoptosis, dendritic transection and the loss of dendritic arborization are substantial in cortical lesions. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. dendrites can be cleaved directly by CTL that bind to MHC I on the neuron membrane. soluble mediators of inflammation may also affect nearby somas and dendrites. it is important to note that in neurons, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress promote each other mutually. the death of soma directly results in axon dysfunction and slow disintegration. iron and Asc are a well-known \u201ccombination to avoid\u201d as Asc promotes Fenton reaction. ligands that favor Fe3+ involve oxygen in iron binding, whereas ligands that bind Fe2+ involve nitrogen and sulfur (118). iron may play a role in axon degeneration. ligands that favor Fe3+ involve oxygen in iron binding. ligands that favor Fe2+ involve nitrogen and sulfur. ligands that bind Fe2+ involve nitrogen and sulfur. cuprizone is a copper-chelating agent which is applied in order to provoke MS-similar symptoms in animal models. the mechanisms of cuprizone-activated demyelination are not fully understood, but they appear to involve metabolic stress in ODC and activation of CXCR2+ neutrophils (276). the structure of cuprizone seems to allow the formation of such complexes. redox therapy for MS patients is intricated by heterogeneity of pathophysiological mechanisms involved. antioxidative therapies targeting different processes in degenerative and neurodegenerative component may be futile or even show negative effects when it comes to autoimmunity. most accurate way to determine which component predominates in each MS patient is to determine the pattern of lesions. redox therapy should not be uniformly applied, and it should be developed to target specific mechanisms (patterns) there is no substantial proof that any of the standard nutritional antioxidants (vitamins C and E, lipoic acid, and others) have any effects on MS development. short-term exposure to fumarates results in decreased intracellular GSH level and short-lived oxidative stress (10, 268, 392) long-term exposure showed quite the opposite effects. dimethyl fumarate stabilizes Nrf2 and promotes Nrf2-dependent transcriptional activity. the effects of fumarates on the activity of redox-relevant transcription factors in neurons and astrocytes and on the redox switches in T cells. the binding of fumarates on specific thiol residues prevents NF-B translocation to nucleus, kinase-provoked release of IB, and the binding of KEAP1 to Nrf2. this may stop prooxidative cascade in astrocytes/neurons and promote antioxid cannabinoids may slow the progression of disability, increase mobility, and decrease relapse rate (485). a large long-term follow-up study (CAMS) indicated that cannabinoids may slow the progression of disability, increase mobility, and decrease relapse rate (485). cannabinoid receptors (CBs) are widely present in neurons, while CB2 is mainly found in immune cells (486) neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids against oxidative stress are not mediated by CB1 receptors (293) cannabinoids may stop redox-cycle development in astrocytes in early or pattern III lesions. mitoxantrone (DNA-reactive agent) is known to suppress NF-B DNA-binding activity and NO production in stimulated astrocytes. teriflunomide (the inhibitor of pyrimidine de novo synthesis), which is used for oral treatment of patients suffering from RRMS worsening, inhibits iNOS in astrocytes. methylthioadenosine (naturally occurring sulfur-containing nucleoside) prevents degradation of IB-, resulting in impaired NF-B activation and suppressed iNOS activity. epigallocatechin-3-gallate exerts protective and regenerative effects in neurons exposed to inflammation. some studies showed that the application of selective iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine leads to a significant decrease in the clinical expression of EAE. it is tempting to speculate that the inhibitors of NF-B and iNOS could provide the best results if applied early in MS. a recent study showed that ketogenic diet slows down the development of motor disability and the loss of spatial learning and memory. the suggested mechanisms behind these effects involve amelioration of immune response and oxidative stress. the most promising agents currently available are able to target both degenerative and inflammatory components. the most accurate way to determine which component predominates in each MS patient is to determine the pattern of lesions. the most accurate way to determine which component predominates in each MS patient is to determine the pattern of lesions. redox-active compounds have been involved in clinical research. they act via specific mechanisms that may or may not interfere with the processes responsible for a particular disease. redox-active compounds have been involved in clinical research and showed substantial benefits. study on astrocytes exposed to inflammation showed fumarates reduce nuclear levels of NF-B p65 subunit, prevent the loss of IB- (NF-B inhibitor) and drastically suppress iNOS expression. underlying mechanism most likely involves irreversible binding of fumarates to thiol redox switches on T-cell membranes. pyruvate is available as a dietary supplement, while pyruvate is approved for human use. it exerts anti-inflammatory effects via GSH depletion, activates Nrf2 in astrocytes, inhibits NF-B-dependent transcription by targeting p65 subunit. pyruvate attenuates the effects of ONOO (227) l does not significantly slow the progression of disability in the general MS population, but may show beneficial effects in patients at the lower end of the disability scale (212) cannabinoids do not target the neurodegenerative component of MS, which is responsible for the promotion of neurological problems later during the MS progression. cannabinoids affect ODC precursors via CB2 stimulation. cannabidiol is known to protect ODC progenitor cells from oxidative stress and inflammation-provoked apoptosis by decreasing expression of endoplasmatic reticulum apoptotic effectors. fluoxetine (antidepressant; trade names Prozac and Sarafem) has been shown to reduce the development of focal inflammatory lesions in MS patients. it is effective in inhibiting microglia activation, including NF-B-dependent generation of NO by iNOS. mycophenolate mofetil (antimetabolite immunosuppressive prodrug) is known to attenuate iNOS expression (269) laquinimod (immunomodulatory agent) exhibited beneficial effects in the phase III trial on RRMS patients, slowing down the progression of disability and reducing relapse rate. deferiprone could have been a more effective choice (321) some interesting novel strategies have been proposed in iron chelation therapy. on the other hand, prooxidative activity of iron relies on molecules that form inappropriately chelated iron complexes. the targeting of those molecules may represent the future of neurodegeneration treatment. a similar explanation may be valid for recently published results. the activation of sirtuin protein system, encoded by vitagenes, has been shown to prevent the loss of neurons and axonal density and improve neuronal function in EAE (489). -cell apoptosis and activity suppression induced by different agents. NAC should be preferentially applied in pattern III patients. one phase II trial on RRMS patients has been conducted. the current review represents our humble attempt to do so. we have focused on redox processes, carefully trying not to overestimate their role in each step of MS pathogenesis, from initiation to neurodegeneration."}
