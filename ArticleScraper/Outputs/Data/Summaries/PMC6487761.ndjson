{"summary": "the genus Pneumocystis contains highly diversified and opportunistic fungal species that cause severe pneumonia in mammals with a deficient immune system. in most of the previously reported veterinary cases, in vivo diagnosis of Pneumocystis spp. pneumonia was achieved by direct identification by cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, trans-tracheal aspirates, or transthoracic lung aspirates CKCS female was not vaccinated and had not received any heartworm prophylaxis in the previous 3 months. antibiotic treatment with appropriate doses of doxycycline, metronidazole\u2013spiramycin, and finally a 10-day course of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid failed to resolve or even improve clinical signs. serum biochemical profiles showed an increase in serum C-reactive protein (6.9 mg/L; reference interval, 0.1\u20130.6), a mild hypoalbuminemia (27 g/L; reference interval, 29\u201333), and a mild hypoglobulinemia (21 g/L; reference interval, 24\u201332). serum immunoglobulin fraction quantification showed a decreased immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration (0.58 g/L; reference interval, 0.76\u20131.8 and the decreased gammaglobuline zone is consistent with an hypogammaglobulinemia pattern. the dog was pre-medicated with butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg, IM) and dexmedetomidine (0.002 mg/kg, IM) and maintained using a propofol infusion (0.1\u20130.4 mg/kg/min) strongylus vasorum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. were also performed. a portion of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA gene (mtSSU rRNA gene) was amplified and sequenced by nested PCR. the dog was discharged from the hospital, pending results and against medical advice. at the end of all diagnostic procedures, the dog had fully recovered from the anesthesia and physical examination was unchanged compared to the morning admission. post-mortem examination was declined from the owner. the imbalance between the different lifecycle forms of Pneumocystis spp. might explain the lower diagnostic yield of cytology in certain instances. the imbalance between the different lifecycle forms of Pneumocystis spp. might explain the lower diagnostic yield of cytology. pneumothorax has been reported only following a lung fine needle aspiration on a CKCS. in human medicine, it is described as a clinical finding in 5%\u201310% of human patients affect by PP. the dog was discharged from the hospital soon after the BAL procedure. the detection of Pneumocystis spp. DNA in symptomatic patients is strongly recommended in human medicine."}
