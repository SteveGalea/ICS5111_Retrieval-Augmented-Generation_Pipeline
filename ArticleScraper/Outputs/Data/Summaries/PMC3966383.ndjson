{"summary": "the study four bat guano samples were collected from known roost sites on the remote island of Whenua hou (Codfish Island) the island is heavily forested and largely unmodified by humans. it has special conservation status for the protection of endangered species. BLASTn output for contigs from bat guano that show identity to alphacoronaviruses, new Zealand*. bp Highest scoring BLASTn hit recorded against alphacoronaviruses e-value Nucleotide identity (%) Phylogenetic analysis was performed for Rdrp (Figure 1) and for the spike protein, as derived from metagenomic data (GenBank accession no. KF575176) we propose that these data support identification of a new alphacoronavirus, which has been designated as Mystacina bat CoV/New Zealand/2013. evolutionary history was inferred for 183 informative amino acid sites by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the Whilan and Goldman the alphacoronavirus identified in this study from M. tuberculata bat guano is unique in respect to the extreme geographic and evolutionary isolation of the host bat species. the current estimate for a common ancestor for all coronaviruses is 8,100 bce (13) a new survey for Mystacina bat coronavirus in mammals in new Zealand would provide further insights into the origin of coronaviruses. only a small number of conservation staff handle these bats, these staff use standard personal protective equipment and work practice. staff are also offered prophylactic rabies vaccination as a precautionary measure, even though New Zealand is free from rabies."}
