{"summary": "RNA-seq analysis of mRNA cleavage by RNase L in HeLa extracts. results direct cleavage of human transcripts by RNase L. this approach removes the nucleus and the plasma membrane. incubation of untreated S10 extracts had no significant effects on the mRNA levels. addition of 2\u20135A or the RNase L2\u20135A complex produced a broad response. levels of multiple mRNAs fell by 100\u20131,000-fold when most of the 28S rRNA was still uncleaved. RNase L cleaves the UNN pattern but prefers UUN and UAN sites in model substrates (17, 23) the UU/UA preference is recapitulated in our RNA-seq data. AUAU motif is also enriched in the 3\u2032-UTRs (Fig. 1H) and often co-occurs with the AUUUA motif. mRNAs could be more accessible to RNase L, have a higher tendency to exist in locally single-stranded structures, or have bound helper proteins. common targets down-regulated by threefold are designated as S10+ signatures. the 1,016 most resistant transcripts from sample 1 and transcripts down-regulated by no more than 10% in sample 2 are designated as S10\u2013 signatures. mRNAs with short 3\u2032UTRs selectively removed. second subset contains 5,250 transcripts (also 50% of the entire dataset) mRNAs with short 3\u2032UTRs selectively removed and contains 5,250 transcripts. RLDD targets are strongly enriched for transcripts regulated by the microRNAs miR-21, miR-30, miR-155, miR-192, and miR-200. these microRNAs regulate cell cycle, growth, proliferation, apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and adipogenesis (28\u201331), which recapitulates the known repertoire of RNase L. profiling mRNA targets using RNase L overexpression in live HeLa cells. Western blot analysis of overexpressed WT and H672N RNase L. control point mutant H672N shows no rRNA cleavage. RNA targets of RNase L in live HeLa cells using RNAi. expression of rNase L in cells transfected with RNAi for RNase L and with scrambled RNA control (scrRNA) RNA-seq traces for select targets (A) and nontargets (B) of RNase L. RNA-seq traces for select targets (A) and nontargets (B) of RNase L. 5A activates cleavage of 28S rRNA in WT but not in KO HAP1 cells. gene sets that exhibit inverse enrichment compared with poly-A+ samples are marked with an ampersand. KO cells obey sequence rules established for direct mRNA cleavage by RNase L in HeLa extracts. RLDD is conserved in HAP1 cells and that RNase L is constitutively active in these cells due to endogenous dsRNA (36) or 2\u20135A-independent RNase L activation. posttranscriptional regulation in HAP1 cells resembles that in HeLa and T47D experiments. the notion that RNase L shares common targets with these microRNAs suggests that RNase L may exhibit similar physiologic activities. we used a scratch wound healing assay to test whether RNase L regulates proliferation in HAP1 cells. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding WT and H672N mutant RNase L for 16 h. the 2\u20135A was transfected and cells were counted at several time points. the right panel includes the first 16 h of overexpressing WT or H672N RNase L. HeLa and MEF cells were transfected with plasmids encoding WT and H672N mutant RNase L-KO. plasmids encoding WT and H672N mutant RNase L overexpression. kinetics was measured using three biological replicates (Methods) to observe cleavage of human transcripts by RNase L. this approach removes the nucleus and the plasma membrane. incubation of untreated S10 extracts had no significant effects on the mRNA levels. addition of 2\u20135A or the RNase L2\u20135A complex produced a broad response. levels of multiple mRNAs fell by 100\u20131,000-fold when most of the 28S rRNA was still uncleaved. recombinant RNase L cleaves the UNN pattern but prefers UUN and UAN sites in model substrates (17, 23) the AUU/UA preference is recapitulated in our RNA-seq data. a known stability element (AU-rich element) found usually in the 3\u2032-UTRs of mRNAs (24) the AUUAU motif is also enriched in the 3\u2032-UTRs (Fig. 1H) and often co-occurs with the AUUUA motif (Fig. S1D, R2 = 0.68). mRNAs could be more accessible to RNase L, have a higher tendency to exist in locally single-stranded structures. common targets down-regulated by threefold are designated as S10+ signatures; the 1,016 most resistant transcripts from sample 1 and transcripts down-regulated by no more than 10% in sample 2 are designated as S10\u2013 signatures. observed FDR values for each signature are shown in the right column. the first subset contains only mRNAs with short 3\u2032UTRs of 1,000 nt (5,330 transcripts, 50% of the entire dataset) the second subset contains the mRNAs with short 3\u2032UTRs selectively removed and contains 5,250 transcripts (also 50% of the entire dataset). the enrichment for zinc fingers suggests a possible cause of transcriptional (10) gene regulation by RNase L. the RLDD targets are strongly enriched for transcripts regulated by the microRNAs miR-21, miR-30, miR-155, miR-192, and miR-200. RLDD targets the same mRNA groups in cells and in S10 extracts.

RNA-seq traces for select targets (A) and nontargets (B) of RNase L. the knowledge of physical mRNA targets and nontargets allows profiling of the RNase L program with considerable resolution. the 2\u20135A activates cleavage of 28S rRNA in WT but not RNase L-KO HAP1 cells. gene sets that exhibit inverse enrichment compared with poly-A+ samples are marked with an ampersand (&) the global mRNA stabilization in RNase L-KO cells obeys the sequence rules established for direct mRNA cleavage by RNase L in HeLa extracts. RLDD is conserved in HAP1 cells and that RNase L is constitutively active in these cells due to endogenous dsRNA (36) or 2\u20135A-independent RNase L activation (37) the miR-200/ZEB1 and miR-29/CTNND1 pathways inhibit cell proliferation and adhesion (28, 31, 42, 43) the notion that RNase L shares common targets with these microRNAs suggests that RNase L may exhibit similar physiologic activities. we used a scratch wound healing assay to test whether RNase L regulates proliferation in HAP1 cells. plasmids encoding WT and H672N mutant RNase L were transfected for 16 h. the 2\u20135A was transfected and cells were counted at several time points (Methods) CDH1 Hs.PT.58.45747629 (PrimeTime qPCR primer pair; exons 14 and 15) CDH9 CAGAAGCCCTGATCCTTTCA GCAGCAAACAACAACACGACTAAA CTNND1 TGCCTCTCTTCTCTC ESRG GCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT FAT4 GTGGCCTTGATTTTTTTT ACCTCGATTGGCATCATG heLa and MEF cells were transfected with plasmids encoding WT and H672N mutant RNase L. after 24 h of adhesion, kinetics was measured using three biological replicates. human RNase L was PCR-amplified to include an N-terminal FLAG tag (Sigma) and cloned into pcDNA4/TO.

RNA integrity was verified by an RNA 6000 Nano Chip. oligo-dT pull-down step was replaced with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal. cDNA was prepared using random hexamers and a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit. qPCR was performed using the Power SYBR green PCR mix in a 96-well format in the StepOnePlus qPCR machine as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the binomial probability for finding ki common genes among #gi total genes is computed: ki = #giS. the binomial probability for finding ki common genes among #gi total genes is computed: ki = #giS. q-value was used as a weighted measure of statistical significance. significant discoveries in GSEA were expected at FDR 0.25 (25) a combination of two DsiRNAs (Dicer-substrate RNAs) was used. a combination of two DsiRNAs (Dicer-substrate RNAs) was used. a suspension of nave WT or RNase L KO cells was obtained from an adherent master plate using 0.25% trypsin + EDTA (Gibco, Life Technologies) these cells were seeded at 70% confluence into six-well plates. an 80%-confluent six-well plate was transfected with 2 g of the respective plasmids. media was changed every 12 h to remove floating/dead cells. a six-well plate was transfected with 2 g per well of either plasmid. photos were taken using 20 magnification at several time points. RNA cleavage assays were initiated by adding 16 L of S10 to a tube containing 1 L of 20 mM ATP, 2 L of 1 M RNase L or plain buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 2 mM DTT), and 1 L of 200 M 5\u2032-p-A2\u2032,5\u2032A2\u2032, our RNA-seq experiments typically identified 10,000\u201311,000 human transcripts with read counts above this cutoff. qPCR was performed using the Power SYBR green PCR mix in a 96-well format in the StepOnePlus qPCR machine as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the approach counts common genes, #SG, and divides the result by the length of G. for each bin, the number of common genes with S is calculated: ki = #giS. the binomial probability for finding ki common genes among #gi total genes is computed: Pi = Pbinomial(p, #gi, ki) GSEA 4.0 (25), RK, RK with few and many UAUAU sites, microRNA TargetScan, and miR-200, miR-155, miR-192, miR-215, and miR-1 experimental (Dataset S2).
