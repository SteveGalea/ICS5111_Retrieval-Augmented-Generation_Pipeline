{"summary": "there are three recognized genera of influenza viruses, designated influenza A virus (IAV or FLUAV), influenza B virus (FLUBV), and influenza C virus (FLUCV). FLUAV proteins include 5 structural proteins, HA (hemagglutinin), NA, M1, M2, and NP. 3 subunits of RNA polymerase complex, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) in 2011, a new influenza virus was isolated in Oklahoma from a 15-week-old swine showing influenza-like symptoms. the virus was negative for neuraminidase and positive for O-acetyl esterase activity, which is a characteristic of FLUCV. the bovine and swine FLUDVs shared more than 96% homology in all the segments. the most divergent segments were HEF and P42/M. the most divergent segments were PB1 and NS. the ability of swine FLUDV to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets may indicate the zoonotic potential of these viruses. the aim of this study was to examine viral replication, transmission, and virulence properties of the novel bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. guinea pigs acquired infection from the cocaged infected guinea pigs. the virus was grown on human rectal tumor cells at a multiplicity of infection. the cells were allowed to reach only 60% to 70% confluence at the time of infection. DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (200 U/ml) and TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used as the virus growth and maintenance medium. the animals were ear tagged for identification purposes. the duration of the experiment was 3 weeks. the group for studying virus kinetics consisted of 10 infected animals and 3 mock-infected animals. the animals were infected intranasally with 3 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/300 l of influenza D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 virus. blood, nasal wash, nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung samples were collected. animals monitored for weight loss, temperature changes, and other clinical signs. blood, nasal wash, nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung samples collected. rane, and alternate nostrils were used for sample collection on alternate days. washes were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged at 500 g for 6 min at 4\u00b0C to remove any debris. the supernatants were stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. a 100-l volume of rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against bovine FLUDV was added at a 1:200 dilution to each of the wells. the plates were moistened with PBS for 10 min at room temperature before staining. DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (200 U/ml) and 0.5 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. virus grown from the infected lung homogenates was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq system. nucleotide sequences of HEF obtained from the inoculum and the lung homogenates of guinea pigs were analyzed against all the homologous sequences in the NCBI database the sections were stained with 100 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako EnVision+ System-HRP [DAB], Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 30 min. the sections were then stained with 100 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. fresh DMEM with 0.5 g/ml tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added for further incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5 days. the supernatant was spun at 500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the cellular debris. infected animals were infected intranasally with 3 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/300 l of influenza D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 virus (bovine FLUDV) at 24 h postinfection, three sentinel animals were added to the same cage. three sentinel animals were added at 24 h postinfection. the cages were kept away from the vents to minimize the dilution of aerosols by room ventilation. blood was collected from all animals from the jugular vein/cranial vena cava. the nasal washes were collected by instilling 1 ml of PBS using a sterile 25-to-28-gauge cannula into the nostrils and collecting the washes by draining to sterile containers or petri dishes. animals were anesthetized using isoflurane, and alternate nostrils were used for sample collection on alternate days. the infected cell culture plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C. after 5 days, the plates were washed with PBS, fixed in 80% acetone, and allowed to dry. the plates were stained for determinations of virus titers in nasal washes and tissue homogenates. cells were allowed to reach 60% to 70% confluence and were then infected with bovine FLUDV at an MOI of 0.1 in 1 ml of DMEM. fresh virus infection medium, i.e., DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (200 U/ml) and 0.5 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin, was added for further incubation. sections stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against purified bovine FLUDV. sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and immersed in 3% H2O2\u2013distilled water for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase. sections were then stained with 5% goat serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)\u2013TBS buffer for 1 h. direct infected animals behaved similarly to mock-infected animals. the difference was calculated by comparing the postinfection body weight to the average of the body weights recorded 2 days prior to the infection. the direct inoculated animals did not show any significant change in body weight compared to the mock-infected animals. this change was not statistically significant for the mock-infected animals. guinea pigs and 3 guinea pigs were mock inoculated with PBS. body weight and temperature were measured daily from 2 days before infection until 14 dpi. percentage changes in body weight (A) and changes in body temperature (B) expressed as means standard errors. two inoculated animals were randomly euthanized at 9 dpi. shedding in nasal washes was reduced to undetectable levels on 9 dpi. this clearly showed that bovine FLUDV can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of guinea pigs. the presence of virus in the lungs as well as in nasal washes and nasal turbinates until 7 dpi indicated that virus was actively replicating. one of the 2 infected animals seroconverted on 7 dpi (HI titer, 40) and 2 of the 2 infected animals seroconverted with titers of 20 and 80 on 9 dpi. guinea pigs could be a good model to study the replication and kinetics of bovine FLUDV. guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with 3 105 TCID50/300 l of bovine FLUDV. guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with 3 105 TCID50/300 l of bovine FLUDV. all of the animals were euthanized at 14 dpi. temperatures measured daily from 2 days prior to infection to 14 dpi. changes in percentages of body weights compared to preinfection body weights (A) and changes in temperatures of infected animals compared to temperatures of sentinels (B) in contact transmission group. all three direct infected animals in contact group seroconverted with HI titers of 40 to 80. one sentinel animal seroconverted with an HI titer of 40 at 14 dpi. absence of serum HI antibody titer in the other sentinel animal can be explained by the late commencement of infection (8 dpi), indicating that the guinea pigs had cleared the virus. the duration of the experiment and the collection of nasal washes were similar to the conditions used for the contact transmission experiment. in the aerosol transmission group, 3/3 directly infected animals showed detectable virus replication and shed the virus in their nasal washes until 6 dpi. none of the three sentinel animals shed any detectable level of virus in nasal washes or had virus present in lungs and nasal turbinates. on necropsy, primary gross lung lesions showed areas of congestion and hemorrhage on 1 dpi that progressed to areas of pulmonary consolidation at 3, 5, and 7 dpi. lungs from the sentinel animal infected by contact showed similar areas of pulmonary consolidation comparable to the macroscopic lung lesions of directly inoculated animals on 5 and 7 dpi. sloughing of pulmonary epithelium and suppurative inflammation in examined lung. panels A1 and B1 showed multifocal areas of pulmonary consolidation in directly inoculated and contact-infected sentinel animals. detailed histology results are shown at magnifications of 100 for the second row (A2, B2, and C2) and 200 for the third row (A3, B3, and C3) bovine FLUDV antigens were present in larger amounts within alveolar septum and within bronchi and the bronchiolar epithelium in the lungs of directly inoculated animals. at 14, the amount of viral antigen in the lungs of a sentinel animal acquired infection by contact was comparable to the amount of viral antigen present in those of the directly inoculated animals. bovine FLUDV antigen in the lung tissue of the sentinel animal infected through contact. panels A1, A2, and A3 represent lungs from the sentinel animal infected by contact. brown staining shows cells positive for bovine FLUDV antigen. both of the recovered virus isolates from guinea pig lungs exhibited mutations in HEF, P42, and NP proteins compared to the parent inoculum. HEF protein sequence analysis of the parent inoculum and of virus from the lung of sentinel animal which acquired infection by contact revealed 1 mutation, A746G, with an amino acid change of N249S. nt C755T A746G aa A252V (45.2) N249S (99.1) P42 nt G121A; *A122G; C946T G121A; *A122G; C946T aa E41R (98.6); L316F (98.5) NP nt G741C; *T760C; *T768C; *A792G aa E247D (99. the clinical significance of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs was assessed by regular monitoring of changes in body weight and temperature over a period of 9 days postinfection. viral replication in the lower and upper respiratory tracts of the guinea pigs was evaluated by determining the amount of virus shed in nasal washes and homogenates of lung and nasal turbinate tissues over a period of 9 days. guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with 3 105 TCID50/300 l of bovine FLUDV. a total of 10 guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with 3 105 TCID50/300 l of bovine FLUDV. 3 guinea pigs were mock inoculated with PBS. two random animals were selected and euthanized on 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 dpi. the results of our experiments showed that FLUDV shedding in the nasal washes started at low levels and then reached a highest titer of 5.75 log10 TCID50/ml on 3 dpi. pre- and postinfection serum samples were tested for the presence of virus-specific antibodies against bovine FLUDV prior to infection. the antibody response to bovine FLUDV infection was measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 dpi in the directly inoculated group. 3 inoculated guinea pigs at 1 dpi were allowed to cocage with three sentinel animals. the experiment facilitated direct but also indirect contact (droplets and aerosols) the potential transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs through contact was investigated. three guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with 3 105 TCID50/300 l of bovine FLUDV. after 24 h, 3 uninfected guinea pigs were added to each cage as sentinels. body weights and temperatures were measured daily from 2 days prior to infection to 14 dpi. titers in lungs (B) and nasal turbinates (D) are expressed as log10 TCID50 per milliliter. for panels B and D, each shape represents an individual animal. to confirm the presence of transmission, guinea pig sera from the contact transmission group were tested for the presence of virus-specific HI antibodies. three guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with 3 105 TCID50/300 l. three noncontact sentinel animals were placed in same cages after 24 h. the infected and sentinel animals were separated with double-walled wire mesh. pathology of bovine FLUDV in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs. neither experimentally infected guinea pigs nor contact-infected guinea pigs showed any clinical signs of disease after bovine FLUDV infection. mild to moderate macroscopic changes were observed in the lungs of the directly inoculated animals and contact-infected animals during necropsy. the sentinel animal acquired the infection from a cocaged infected animal by contact developed similar inflammatory changes with thickened alveolar septa, bronchitis, peribronchial and perivascular lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration. one of the three uninfected control animals showed the presence of foreign material possibly derived from the bedding material and demonstrated mild sloughing of pulmonary epithelium. uninfected lung sections showed clear alveolar spaces without any inflammatory cell infiltration. bovine FLUDV antigens were present in larger amounts within alveolar septum and within bronchi and the bronchiolar epithelium in the lungs of directly inoculated and infected animals. bovine FLUDV antigens were present in the alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. panels A1, A2, and A3 represent lungs from the sentinel animal infected by contact. panels A1, A2, and A3 represent lungs from the sentinel animal infected by contact. genome of viruses isolated from the lungs of directly inoculated and cocaged sentinel animals. RNA was extracted from the parent inoculum and also from the viruses recovered from lung homogenates of directly inoculated and cocaged sentinel guinea pigs. changes occurred at frequencies of 93% to 99% in our RNA-seq reads. there were two changes occurring at around 50% frequency, indicating strong polymorphism at these positions. a laboratory animal model would help us understand the viral and host factors responsible for the virulence, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of the unadapted bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. this study evaluated the virulence of the unadapted bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs by testing its ability to replicate by means of aerosol spread and contact. intranasal inoculation of 106 TCID50/ml swine FLUDV in pigs and ferrets also resulted in no clinical symptoms or shed virus in nasal washes from 3 dpi (7). guinea pigs seroconverted with HI antibody titers ranging from 20 to 80 within a period of 14 days. bovine FLUDV replicated in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts of animals. swine FLUDV replicated only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract of diseased pigs. this observation is consistent with our clinical data showing that bovine and swine viruses appear to differ in lung tropism in different animals. both 2,6 and 2,3 sialylated glycoproteins were present in nasal epithelia and trachea. swine and bovine FLUDV utilizes 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as the cellular receptor to trigger an infection. it is not clear whether FLUDV can bind to Neu5,9Ac2 with both linkages with similar levels of efficiency. airborne transmission experiments largely depended on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, airflow of the experiment room, and infectious dose used. previous experiments using influenza type A and B viruses in guinea pigs conducted in environmental test chambers demonstrated efficient transmission lasting for a longer period at 5\u00b0C and 20% relative humidity (RH) approximately 3,000 nasal swabs of pigs with influenza-like symptoms resulted in only 4 positive-testing samples. the low-aerosol-transmission issue was observed also in our ferret study. the inefficient transmission observed in pigs, ferrets, and guinea pigs is in a marked contrast with that observed in cattle. a serum HI titer of 80 in that cocaged seropositive animal definitely alleviated the pathogenesis caused by virus reactivation. a potent monoclonal IgG antibody administered intramuscularly against H1N1 virus hemagglutinin failed to protect the animals from airborne transmission. however, the same monoclonal IgG antibody administered intranasally and also administered intramuscularly as recombinant IgA significantly guinea pigs can act as a feasible model for studying the pathogenesis of influenza D viruses. guinea pigs are naturally susceptible to FLUDV and therefore represent an excellent animal model to study host-virus interactions. this novel influenza virus is a novel influenza virus."}
