{"summary": "a total of 117 specimens (0.7%) were positive, originating from five continents. phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated considerably more diversity among these novel viruses than primate HAVs. phylogenetically basal clades contained shrew and bat viruses from central Europe (clade I), African rodent viruses (clade II), Malagasy and European bat viruses (clade III) and African and European bat viruses (clade IV) pairwise sequence distances indicate these novel viruses represent 13 new Hepatovirus species. number of sampled host genera, specimens, and dates of collection. the 7% cutoff separating hepatovirus species in this dataset is highlighted by a slashed line. the distance to the next closely related genus Tremovirus (represented by AEV) is highlighted to the right. only limited phylogenetic cosegregation was evident for these novel nonprimate hepatoviruses and their mammalian host species. viruses from different bat hosts sampled globally occupied three different phylogenetic positions (nodes b1\u2013b3), while viruses from Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs and shrews) occupied two different phylogenetic positions (nodes c1\u2013c2). the origin of all mammalian hepatoviruses was consistently projected to a Laurasiatherian host and an insectivorous diet. the results collectively suggest a long and complex evolutionary history of hepatoviruses in small mammals. each genome contains a series of predicted 5\u2032 terminal pseudoknots similar to those present in human HAV. each genome also contains a predicted cis-acting replication element (cre) of variable size but conserved structure in the 3Dpol region (18) hepatovirus 5\u2032UTR RNA secondary structure of viruses not shown in main text. shrew virus KS12-1289 represents the near-identical virus KS12-1232. shrew virus KS12-1289 represents the near-identical virus KS12-1232. hepatoviruses from cricetid rodents are predicted to contain the most closely related IRES and cre elements. features common to each of the nonprimate viruses include the predicted absence of a leader protein, a small VP4 (16-26 amino acids) lacking an N-terminal myristoylation signal, an approximate 3- to 9-kDa C-terminal pX extension on VP1. yPX3L \u201clate domain\u201d motifs in VP2 (7) contribute to HAV membrane envelopment. conservation of hepatovirus VP2 proteins and divergence of hepatovirus 2B proteins. pX-2B domain may be associated with host adaptation and prone to acquisition of exogenous sequence elements. hypotheses consistent with experimental data showing that 2B harbors key mutations associated with cell culture adaptation of human HAV. the results hint at significant conservation of capsid antigenicity between the Eidolon hepatovirus lineage and human HAV. they are consistent with conservation of sequences of several neutralization epitopes located in the capsid proteins VP3, VP2 and VP1. a genomic representation of HAV is given on top. near-identical viruses from rodents, hedgehogs and shrews are represented. height of bars in 2010 was set to 101 to highlight that these specimens were detectable only by nested RT-PCR but could not be quantified using a strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assay. arrow symbolizes the birth of the first pup, after which all pups are born in a short time frame. in situ hybridization in bat hepatocytes and in large mononuclear cells within the germinal center of splenic lymphatic nodules. RNA (a replicative intermediate) was detected in the liver and spleen of bats, but only in the liver of hedgehogs. nine hedgehogs tested positive for hepatoviruses in up to three separate specimens. nine of these animals tested positive for hepatoviruses in up to three separate specimens. the detection rate decreased significantly 1 mo later, only to rise again after parturition in mid-july. the data suggest an absence of persistent infections in the majority of animals, followed by a new wave of acute infections in offspring. a highly divergent hepatovirus which was genetically related to viruses from shrews was identified in six specimens. a total of 117 specimens (0.7%) were positive, originating from five continents. phylogenetically basal clades contained shrew and bat viruses from central Europe (clade I), African rodent viruses (clade II), Malagasy and European bat viruses (clade III), American, European, and African bat viruses (clade IV). hepatovirus patristic distance per host order; aa, amino acid. averaged number of host switches from ASR shown in E originating from and received by each hepatovirus host order. genomes of hepatoviruses were represented by one virus only. genome lengths are shown with curved lines. hepatoviruses from cricetid rodents in central Europe and Asia (node a1), northern America (node a2) and murid rodents from africa (node a3) could not be completely characterized. viruses from different bat hosts sampled globally occupied three different phylogenetic positions (nodes b1\u2013b3). viruses from Laurasiatheria (bats, hedgehogs, and shrews) and Euarchontoglires (rodents) were intermixed. in two instances, however, pairs of genetically closely related viruses were identified in the same bat genus in biogeographically distinct regions. no host switch was projected to involve a primate donor. we determined 14 near-complete genome sequences of nonprimate hepatoviruses representing 9 predicted species. each is similar in organization and length to human HAV. hepatovirus genome organization. shrew hepatovirus features in primate HAV, nonprimate HAV, and the Picornaviridae. both viruses contained type IV-like IRES structures including pseudoknot preceding the initiation codon. unpaired sequence between SL I and SL II is represented by dots for graphical reasons. hepatoviruses from cricetid rodents are predicted to contain the most closely related IRES and cre elements. features common to each of the nonprimate viruses and characteristic of hepatoviruses include the predicted absence of a leader protein, a small VP4 (16-26 amino acids) lacking an N-terminal myristoylation signal, an approximate 3- to 9-kDa C-terminal pX extension on VP1 and the absence of a 2 hepatovirus pX-2B domain may be a genomic hotspot potentially associated with host adaptation. pX-2B domain may be prone to acquisition of exogenous sequence elements. pX domain tolerates large deletions and exogenous sequence insertions. antibodies recognizing human HAV in sera from 111 bats (10 different species), 114 rodents (7 species, including several samples PCR-positive for the most closely related hepatovirus lineage. the unique ecological traits of bats may facilitate repeated encounters with human HAV in highly endemic areas. however, it seems unlikely that such an exposure would be of sufficient magnitude to evoke antibody responses without replication of the virus. hepatovirus epitopes associated with neutralization according to ref. 8. the number of analyzed animals and biological replicates is indicated on top and above organs. the absence of cross-reactive antibodies in rodent sera was surprising. it may be possible that rodents differ from other small mammal hosts. alternative explanations may include subtle differences in complex epitopes located in the hepatovirus antigenic sites. liver tissues from 23 PCR-positive and 49 PCR-negative bats, rodents, shrews, and hedgehogs were examined histologically. no consistent difference with control, PCR-negative animals, and no severe liver pathology. the viruses identified in these animals were 100% identical in their respective VP2 sequences, consistent with the very low nucleotide substitution rate of human HAV (10). continuous fecal shedding of virus (106 RNA copies per gram feces) was observed over 79\u2013142 d in four animals. a highly divergent hepatovirus was genetically related to viruses from shrews. the level of amino acid sequence divergence between the two hepatovirus lineages infecting the roost in 2008 and 2010 exceeded 30% in the partial VP2 domain. the level of amino acid sequence divergence between the two hepatovirus lines infecting the roost in 2008 and 2010 exceeded 30% in the partial VP2 domain. evolutionarily ancestral hepatoviruses in bats and shrews compared with more closely related viruses in rodents and primates. ancestral hepatoviruses occur in bats and Eulipotyphla (29) ancestral hepatoviruses occur in hantavirus host associations. new world arenaviruses has become increasingly relevant for human health due to the invasion of pristine habitats by humans and their livestock. antigenic conservation we observed between HAV and nonprimate hepatoviruses from Eidolon bats suggests these viruses belong to a common serotype. this may not apply to all of the novel hepatovirus species we identified, some of which on basis of diversity within the P1 domain likely comprise distinct serotypes.
