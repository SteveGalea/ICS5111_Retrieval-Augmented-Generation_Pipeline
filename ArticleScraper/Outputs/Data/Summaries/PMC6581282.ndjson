{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emerging virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. the virus was first detected in 1998 when it caused an outbreak of severe, rapidly progressing encephalitis in pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. pigs were most likely infected after eating fruit contaminated by infected fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, the animal reservoir of NiV. the host range of NiV is broad, facilitated by the use of the conserved ephrin-B2 and\u2013B3 as cellular receptors. the current lack of licensed vaccines has prompted the WHO to identify NiV as a pathogen requiring urgent investment into development of countermeasures. a vaccine that demonstrates protective efficacy in animal models and acceptable safety and immunogenicity profiles. scale manufacturing has been performed for replication-deficient adenoviral vectored vaccines for Ebola. a simple thermostabilization process allows for vaccine storage at ambient temperatures [24], removing the need for a cold chain for storage and shipping. veroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco) the synthesized G gene from Nipah virus was cloned into a transgene expression plasmid. animals were challenged with 1000LD50 of virus in 500 l DMEM via I.P. inoculation. for each study group, 10 hamsters were used. of these, four animals were euthanized 4 (HeV) or 5 (NiV) days post inoculation. 10 hamsters were immunized using 400 l per hamster. weight was recorded daily up to 10 days post challenge. oropharyngeal swabs were taken daily up to 7 days post challenge. blood and tissues were collected and analyzed for virology and histology. production NiV G and F proteins NiV-G Malaysia (residues E144\u2014T602, gene accession number NC_002728) was cloned into the pHLSEC vector containing a C-terminal GCNt trimerization motif. supernatant was harvested 96 hours after transfection and diafiltrated using the AKTA FLUX system. antibodies were detected using affinity-purified antibody peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-hamster IgG in 5% milk in PBST and TMB 2-component peroxidase substrate (Seracare) all wells were washed 3x with PBST in between steps. cross-reactivity with NiV Bangladesh antibodies was sufficient for use in ELISA by testing sera known to be positive for NiV Bangladesh antibodies. a board-certified veterinary anatomic pathologist evaluated all tissue slides. Statistical analysis was performed by the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test to compare survival curves. SEM was calculated for all samples. 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco) for the homologous challenge vaccine experiment, animals were vaccinated at D-28. three days prior to vaccination and virus challenge animals were bled via orbital sinus puncture. we chose the I.P. route as a uniformly lethal challenge route. purified IgGs were filtered through 0.45m filter and diluted to 4.5 mL in sterile PBS. four animals were euthanized 5 days post challenge and the remaining six were followed for 56 days post challenge. weight was recorded daily up to 10 days post challenge, and oropharyngeal swabs were taken daily up to 7 days post inoculation. production NiV G and F proteins NiV-G Malaysia (residues E144\u2014T602, gene accession number NC_002728) was cloned into the pHLSEC mammalian expression vector containing a C-terminal GCNt trimerization motif. the constructs were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T cells in roller bottles, as described previously [29] antibodies detected using affinity-purified antibody peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-hamster IgG in 5% milk in PBST and TMB 2-component peroxidase substrate (Seracare) all wells were washed 3x with PBST in between steps. cross-reactivity with NiV Bangladesh antibodies was sufficient for usage in ELISA by testing sera known to be positive for NiV Bangladesh antibodies. RNA, UBC and dapB by the RNAscope VS FFPE assay. a board-certified veterinary anatomic pathologist evaluated all tissue slides. Statistical analysis was performed by the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. survival in the vaccinated groups was significant compared to both control animals (P 0.0001). survival in the vaccinated groups was significant compared to both control animals (P 0.0001). titer SEM = 3.3 x 104 2.5 x 104 TCID50/g of tissue. no viral RNA was detected in any tissue of the vaccinated animals. control animals developed pulmonary lesions that were indistinguishable between the two groups. Lung tissue was collected at D5 of animals vaccinated with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiVB. sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or with target-specific probes. hamsters were challenged with either NiV Malaysia or. all vaccinated animals challenged with NiV Malaysia survived with no signs of disease. animals that received ChAdOx1 FGP all succumbed to infection between D5 and D6. survival in the vaccinated group was significantly different from the control group (P = 0.0012) four animals from both groups were euthanized at D4. four animals from both groups were euthanized at D4. four animals from both groups were euthanized at D4. infectious virus was only detected in brain tissue of animals from the control group. harvested lung tissue was then evaluated for pathological changes. hamsters challenged with NiV Malaysia developed mild to moderate bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Lung tissue obtained at D5 of animals injected with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiVB and challenged with HeV. g-h) Lung tissue obtained at D5 of animals injected with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiVB and challenged with HeV. one out of six animals treated with NiV antibodies succumbed to disease on D11. none of the other animals experienced weight loss or signs of disease. surviving animals did not show any signs of disease throughout the experiment. oropharyngeal swabs were taken daily and assessed for infectious virus. shedding was minimal and found in one animal treated with NiV antibodies on D5 and five animals treated with GFP antibodies between D4 and D6. four animals from both groups were euthanized at D5. we vaccinated groups of 10 hamsters with either a single dose at D-42 or a prime-boost regime at D-70 and D-42. no neutralizing antibodies could be detected in serum obtained from the control groups. all hamsters survived challenge and did not show signs of disease. oropharyngeal swabs were collected daily from challenged animals. NiV titers were determined via endpoint titration on veroE6 cells. control animals from both groups shed virus at any timepoint. RNA was detected in lung tissue by ISH. hamsters developed pulmonary lesions that were indistinguishable between the two groups. the nodules were composed of large numbers of foamy macrophages. e-f) Lung tissue obtained at D5 of animals injected with saline. Arrow = Inflammatory cells, fibrin, edema and hemorrhage centered on terminal bronchioles. single-dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 NiVB protects Syrian hamsters against a lethal challenge with NiV Malaysia, but not HeV. Neutralizing antibodies in serum were determined via virus neutralization assay on veroE6 cells. four out of six vaccinated animals challenged with HeV succumbed to disease between D5 and D7. the two survivors showed minimal weight loss (2%) and no signs of disease. animals that received ChAdOx1 FGP all succumbed to HeV infection between D4 and D6. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with NiV Malaysia developed mild to moderate bronchointerstitial pneumonia. ISH demonstrated viral RNA predominantly in type I pneumocytes. in vaccinated animals challenged with NiV Malaysia, there was very little RNA present. Lung tissue obtained at D5 of animals injected with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 FGP and challenged with HeV. Arrow in ISH = Positive endothelial cells lining an artery. 200x magnification. H&E and ISH slides were from sequential sections. two surviving animals did not show any signs of disease throughout the experiment. one animal did not seroconvert as measured by ELISA against NiV F and G protein. survival in the treated group was significant (P = 0.0168) compared to control group. ISH demonstrated viral RNA in type I pneumocytes in areas of inflammation. none of the hamsters showed any pulmonary fibrin, edema or hemorrhage. a vaccine based on NiV Bangladesh G protein in a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector in Syrian hamsters. antibodies elicited by vaccination alone provided partial protection against a NiV Bangladesh challenge. a single-dose vaccination with NiV Bangladesh fully protected Syrian hamsters against lethal disease caused by NiV Malaysia. cross-protection of ChAdOx1 NiVB against a lethal challenge with HeV in hamsters. four out of six animals did not survive challenge. cross-protection of NiV or HeV vaccines has been studied by other groups. a human vaccine (Equivac) is available for horses and fully protects against HeV. the total number of human cases that contracted HeV is relatively low at 7. the requirement of a human vaccine for HeV is therefore less urgent than that of a NiV vaccine. passive transfer experiment shows antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1-NiVB are sufficient for protection against lethal challenge with NiV. animals were observed for 56 days to ensure that the two animals survived would not succumb to disease after 28 days. the Syrian hamster is a suitable initial small animal model to investigate the efficacy of NiV vaccines."}
