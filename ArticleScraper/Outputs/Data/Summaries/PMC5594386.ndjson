{"summary": "the public health emergency preparedness capabilities mobilized to respond to incidents occurring between 2005 and 2015. the capabilities activated most frequently are those mobilized in response to a more limited range of hazards, such as medical countermeasure dispensing and fatality management. 3,8 Seventy-seven percent of King County cases reported in 2016 were among persons born outside the united states. of the 84 cases with drug susceptibility testing, 19% were resistant to at least 1 TB medication. public health\u2014Seattle and King County\u2019s workforce is called on more often and in higher numbers to assist with responses to local communicable diseases. this work protects the residents of King County and helps minimize the spread of infectious TB from King County to other areas of the country and beyond. the TB Control Program partnered with the Preparedness Program. a second round of TB screening was conducted in early November. a person at high school X was diagnosed with active TB. a second case of TB was reported from the same high school in a person who was not on the list of close contacts. a large-scale contact investigation was mobilized in November 2016 to evaluate students and staff. a large-scale contact investigation was mobilized in November 2016 to evaluate students and staff. the action plan was modified from that used with high school X. a second round of screening was conducted a month later. a person at a supportive housing project was diagnosed with active TB. seven individuals were diagnosed with latent TB infection through the contact investigation. no additional cases of active TB disease beyond the original case were identified. a second round of TB screening was conducted in early November to see if anyone converted to a positive test for TB infection. the TB Control Program collaborated with the school administration to establish a plan for notifying students, staff, and contacts identified by the screening. a large-scale contact investigation was mobilized in November 2016 to evaluate students and staff using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) a second round of screening was conducted a month later. TB contact investigations were activated in a timely manner and set up for on-site screening in 1 hour or less. nearly 30 individuals with latent TB infection were identified across the 3 investigations, 10% of whom it is estimated will develop active TB disease. the contact investigations found a relatively low percentage of individuals to have latent TB infection. TB Control Program: Before the incidents, build relationships with demographic groups affected by the TB investigations. TB Control Program: Facilitate briefings, circulate incident action plans and situation reports to establish common operating picture. TB Control Program: Determine, implement, and monitor nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the spread of TB (e.g., school exclusions) Preparedness Program: Develop, communicate, and track corrective actions to improve surveillance and investigation systems for the future. CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; TB = tuberculosis. TB, H5N1 (influenza A virus subtype H5N1), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) local health departments are critical to protecting the public\u2019s health in cities and towns. an emergency fund would protect the public\u2019s health by ensuring that the US public health response force could better respond to disasters."}
