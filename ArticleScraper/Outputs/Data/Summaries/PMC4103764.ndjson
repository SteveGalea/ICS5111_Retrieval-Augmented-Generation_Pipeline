{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suddenly broke out in china in 2002. then rapidly spread to 32 countries, resulting in 8500 infections and over 900 deaths. since the appearance of a new coronavirus called MERS-CoV in April 2012, it has caused 207 confirmed cases, out of which 84 died. both 3C and 3CL-Like proteases use the two-domain chymotrypsin fold to host the complete catalytic machinery. intriguingly, however, in the coronavirus 3CLpro, a 100-residue helical domain was evolutionarily acquired at its C-terminus [1]\u2013[4]. however, unlike 3C protease, only the homodimeric form is catalytically competent for the coV the collapsed catalytic machinery observed in R298A appears to represent a universal inactivated state intrinsic to all inactive enzymes. the same collapsed machinery was found in other monomers triggered by the mutations G11A, N28A and S139A. previously we also identified a mutant N214A, which owns a dramatically abolished activity but only slightly weakened dimerization. the most dramatic changes in STI/A simulations are associated with the nanochannel. this change appears to slightly enhance the dynamic stability of the N-finger and helix A. the key components composed of the catalytic machinery become more dynamically stable, thus rationalizing the enhancement its catalytic activity. mbin cleavage sequence LVPR|GS (CTG GTT CCG CGT GGA TCC) engineered by the company to LVPR| (CTG GTT CCG CGT) which only constituted the thrombin cleavage site in conjunction with the first two N-terminal residues Ser-Gly of SARS 3CLp. to produce STI/A mutant, site-directed mutagenesis was further used to mutate S284-T2 characterization of dimerization The enzymatic activities of the STI/A proteases were measured by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay using a fluorogenic substrate peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) the enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the increase of the emission fluorescence at a wavelength of 538 nm. the STI/A protease was crystallized in a 2 l hanging drop using a condition identical to that previously reported except for a minor variation of the PEG6000 concentration [4], [18], [25]. after a three-day growth, a single crystal was picked up from the crystal clusters for diffraction with the cryoprotective buffer (20% glycerol with the mother liquid). three independent 100-ns MD simulations for each protease were performed with the program GROMACS [35] with the AMBER-03 [36] all-atom force field. the temperature during the simulations was kept constant at 300 K by Berendsen coupling. COM, angle Heavy atoms of all atoms are used in the computation of center of mass. COM of the two chymotrypsin fold (residues 7\u2013180) of both protomers and extra-domain/DomainIII (residue 200\u2013302) of each protomer is calculated. a vector is computed for each COM of Domain III to the COM of the 2 chymotrypsin-folds. the structure coordinate of the STI/A mutant was deposited in Protein Data Bank, with PDB ID code of 3EA8. in order to remove the two extra residues, we transferred the gene encoding SARS 3CLp from the pGEX-4T-1 GST-fusion expression vector to the His-tagged pET28a vector. site-directed mutagenesis was used to shorten the thrombin cleavage sequence LVPR|GS (CTG GTT CCG the protease was expressed in BL21 strain BL21 (DE3) with induction by 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) the protease was obtained by in-gel cleavage with thrombin while the His-tag protein attached to the Nickel-NTA beads (QIAGEN) followed by a FPLC purification on a gel filtration column (HiLoad 16 ITC experiments were carried out to determine the monomer-dimer dissociation constants of the STI/A proteases as previously described [10], [25] using a microcal VP ITC machine. the titration data with endothermic peaks were analyzed using a dimer-monomer dissociation model. the final model was analyzed by PROCHECK [31] and all figures were prepared using Pymol [32]. Molecular dynamics simulations The crystal structures of the WT (PDB code: 2H2Z) [18] and STI/A determined in the present study were selected as the initial models for molecular dynamics simulations. the LINCS algorithm was used to calculate the enclosed volumes of the nano-channel and Thr25-Cys44 leu-P2 substrate pocket. a 3D-grid spacing was constructed around the C of residues: Ser284, Thr285, Ile286 in the nano-channel, and Thr25 and Cys44 in the leu-P2 substrate pocket. MutInf represents an entropy-based approach to analyze ensembles of protein conformers. this approach is even applicable in cases for which conformational changes are subtle. this approach uses second-order terms from the configurational entropy expansion. the Kd value of the STI/A dimerization by ITC is 13.4 M. the STI/A mutation only has a very small enhancement of the dimerization. the ITC dilution profiles were obtained by fitting the data with the built-in microcal ORIGIN software. the STI/A mutant adopts the classic dimeric structure with the same packing of the two protomers as observed in all previously-determined dimeric structures. the dimeric STI/A structure is highly similar to those of the WT protease previously reported. lytic dyad His41-Cys145 examined the B-factors of STI/A and WT proteases. it appears extremely challenging to establish any precise correlation between the B-factors and catalytic activity. this is most likely due to the change of the protein dynamics of the enzyme induced by mutations. mass center of the two catalytic folds together are 32.4 and 63.2 degree for the STI/A determined here at pH 6.0 (3EA7), 33.7 and 66.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 6.0 (2H2Z) [18], 32.6 and 63.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.6 (1UK3), and 32.7 and 63.7 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 8.0 (1UK2) this observation implies that the slightly tighter packing of the extra domains STI/A showed larger overall RMSD than WT, with average RMSD values over 100-ns simulations. the extra domains of STI/A have dramatically higher fluctuations than WT in simulations. root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of the C atoms computed for three independent simulations of the dimeric STI/A (black) and WT (red) for the whole enzyme (a\u2013c); catalytic fold (d\u2013f); and extra domain (g\u2013i). protomer A and B are denoted as P1 and P2 respectively. average values of 512.62212.52, 890.26247.17 and 579.80261.51 3 respectively for three simulations of STI/A. we have also calculated the hydrogen bond occupancy of all simulations for both STI/A and WT.

STI/A showed enhanced dynamic stability in the Glu166 side-chain conformation (Figures 6a-6f) and smaller centroid distance between the side chains of Glu166 and His172 (Figures 6g-6l). the slight decrease in the distance between Glu166 and His172 leads to an increased hydrogen bond occupancy between Glu166 and His172. glu166 and His172 of protomer A (g-i) and protomer B (j-l) for STI/A (black) and WT (red) are denoted as P1 and P2 respectively. the N-finger residues ser1-Ala7 of one protomer have extensive contacts with residues of another protomer. on the other hand, the N-finger residues also make extensive contacts with the extra domains. Arg4 has lower hydrogen bond occupancies with Glu290 and Lys137. Lys5 in WT is restricted to one conformation cluster (90\u00b0Chi130\u00b0) the slight dynamical changes over the N-finger residues appear to affect the downstream helix A (Ser10-Gly15), which are mutually aligned at the dimer interface. the mutation of Asn28 also led to a complete elimination of the dimeric structure and an inactivated and collapsed catalytic machinery. the side-chain conformations of Asn28 as reflected by Chi1 (Figure 7a-7f) and Chi2 (Figure 7g-7l) exhibited an enhanced conformational stability in STI/A. Thr25 and Cys44 lie at the edge of the leu-P2 substrate binding site. the backbone and side-chain conformations of Cys44 are largely similar in both STI/A and WT simulations. three separate time-trajectories of the distance between Thr25 and Cys44 of protomer A (m-o) and protomer B (p-r) for STI/A (black) and WT (red) protomer A and B are denoted as P1 and P2 respectively. s of both catalytic and extra domains have highly correlated motions. these include Phe3-Ser62 contaning the N-finger, helix A, Thr25, Asn28, Cys44 and catalytic dyad residue His41. leu115-Cys156 containing CII-BII residues, oxyanion loop Ser139-Leu141, and catalytic dyad residue Cys145. STI/A and N214A mutation residues are colored in splitpea. yellow boxes in P1 of STI/A highlight the highly correlated motions of N-fingers with the other regions of the enzyme. in P2 of STI/A highlight the expanded, highly correlated motions. T and N214A strongly suggest that the networks to correlate the motions over the whole protease are essential for implementing its catalytic action. the dynamic perturbation onto a key component even without detectable conformational change is sufficient to dramatically inactivate the catalytic machinery by disrupting the correlation network. in the protomer 1 of STI/A, the correlated motions of some pairs of residues become significantly increased as compared to those of WT. protease has a Km value (23.3 M) very similar to those previously reported on the authentic wild-type enzyme (24.2 M) while Kcat of the STI/A protease has a 3.5-fold enhancements. the STI/A mutation only has a very small enhancement of the dimerization. STI/A mutant determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.25 in C2 space group. the Rwork factor of the final models for STI/A mutant was 18.4%. the Rfree factor was 23.1%. the mutation residues Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 are located on the extra domain and far away from the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145. the catalytic enhancement is most likely due to the change of the protein dynamics of the enzyme induced by the mutations. we calculated the distances (d) between the centers of mass of two extra domains and the mass center of the two catalytic folds together. this is 32.4 and 63.2 degree for the STI/A determined here at pH 6.0 (3EA7), 33.7 and 66.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 6.0 (2H2Z) [18], 32.6 and 63.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.6 (1UK3), and 32.7 and 63.7 degree for the wild- the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of C atoms (from their positions in the energy minimized structures) for the dimeric WT and STI/A (a-c), their catalytic folds (domains I and II; d-f) and extra domains only (domain III, g-j). STI/A showed larger overall RMSD than WT, with average RMSD values over 100-ns simulations of STI/A. root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) averaged over 100 ns for both STI/A and WT residues (Figures 3j-3o) root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of the C atoms computed for three independent simulations of the dimeric STI/A (black) and WT (red) the volumes of the nano-channel significantly reduced for STI/A in all three simulations as compared to those of WT. the average values of STI/A were 512.62212.52, 890.26247.17 and 579.80261.51 3 respectively for both STI/A and WT.

STI/A showed enhanced dynamic stability in the Glu166 side-chain conformation. three separate time-trajectories of the distance between Glu166 and His172 of protomer A (a-c) and protomer B (d-f) for STI/A (black) and WT (red) protomer A and B are denoted as P1 and P2 respectively. the side-chain conformation (Chi1) of Lys5 in STI/A prefers 2 conformation clusters (180\u00b0Chi1150\u00b0 and 150\u00b0Chi1180\u00b0) in STI/A, Arg4 has lower hydrogen bond occupancies with Glu290 and Lys137, while Lys5 has higher hydrogen bond occupancies with Glu288. the mutation of Asn28 also led to a complete elimination of the dimeric structure and an inactivated and collapsed catalytic machinery [21]. the side-chain conformations of Asn28 as reflected by Chi1 (Figures 7a-7f) and Chi2 (Figures 7g-7l) exhibited an enhanced conformational stability in STI/A. u-P2 substrate binding site consists of Thr25, Leu27, Val42, Cys44, Thr47, Asp48, Met49, Tyr54, Leu164, and Met165. Thr25 and Cys44 lie at the edge of the leu-P2 substrate binding site. the backbone and side-chain conformations of Cys44 are similar in both STI/A and WT simulations. three separate time-trajectories of distance between Thr25 and Cys44 of protomer A (m-o) and protomer B (p-r) for STI/A (black) and WT (red) three separate time-trajectories of the distance between Thr25 and Cys44 of protomer A (m-o) and protomer B (p-r) for STI/A (black) and WT (red) in the protomer 1 of WT, fragments of both catalytic and extra domains have highly correlated motions. this includes Phe3-Ser62 contaning the N-finger, helix A, Thr25, Asn28, Cys44 and catalytic dyad residue His41. these fragments cover all residues which have been identified to be critical for dimerization and catalysis previously. the STI/A and N214A mutation residues are colored in splitpea. yellow boxes in P1 of STI/A highlight the highly correlated motions of N-fingers with other regions of the enzyme. catalytic fold hosts his41, one of the catalytic dyad residues, loses the significant correlation to the rest of the protease in both protomers. the correlation analysis of both WT and N214A strongly suggest that the networks to correlate the motions over the whole protease are essential for implementing its catalytic action. the monomeric structures of the SARS 3CLpro have the same collapsed catalytic machinery, regardless of being triggered by G11A, N28A or S139A mutations on the catalytic domains [21], [23], [24], or by R298A on the extra domain [22]. this suggests that the dimerization is commonly controlled by a structurally-allosteric network composed of residues of both catalytic and extra domains. STI/A and WT have very similar dynamical behaviors for most residues. the most significant change in STI/A is that in the simulations the two extra domains became further tightly packed in STI/A. this led to a dramatic reduction of the volume of a nano-channel constituted by residues of both catalytic and extra domains. previously high catalytic activity of some enzymes has been correlated with their high stability [57]\u2013[59]. lipase mutant with higher catalytic activity has been characterized to have active sites of higher dynamical rigidity by both MD simulation and experimental studies. the inactive mutant has a slightly weakened dimerization. the more active STI/A mutant has a slightly enhanced dimerization. the results thus decipher a global correlation network in the SARS 3CL protease.
