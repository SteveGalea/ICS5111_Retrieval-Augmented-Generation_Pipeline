VSVG was immunoprecipitated using anti-VSVG antibody. studies using biotinylated derivatives of fatostatin indicate that fatostatin inhibits SREBP cleavage by blocking ER exit of SCAP. sterols fail to block the ER exit of SCAP, resulting in constitutive SREBP activation (21). fatostatin blocks ER exit of SCAP through a distinct INSIG-independent mechanism. fatostatin might retain SCAP in the ER by promoting its interaction with a different ER-resident protein. Alternatively, fatostatin might specifically block SCAP interaction with COPII components, thereby preventing incorporation into COPII vesicles. fatostatin inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport of a model secretory protein. fatostatin also blocks ER-to-Golgi transport and has SCAP-independent effects on cell proliferation."}
