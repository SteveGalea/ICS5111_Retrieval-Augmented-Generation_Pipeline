we retrieved a signal of homogeneous gene flow within the cluster. convergent mutations represent only a small fraction of the homoplasies. three viral genera (Simplexvirus, Betacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) and three bacteriophage clusters (A6, A9, and N) did not diverge substantially from random expectation. these patterns can be caused by the lack of recombination but can arise also from the inclusion of multiple sexually isolated subclades. recombination between viruses can only take place within coinfected cells. the degree of host tropism might affect the delineation of viral species. despite infecting a wide range of mammalian and bird species, we reasoned that the degree of host tropism might affect the delineation of viral species. despite potential sampling biases, several species contain highly divergent members. for example, Mastadenovirus contains members that share only 58% sequence identity for genes constituting their core. such cases suggest viruses are
