{"summary": "Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. the IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe. IBV belongs to group 3 of the genus Coronaviridae. it possesses a positive-stranded RNA genome encoding nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein (S) and small membrane protein. the S protein is posttranslationally cleaved into S1 and S2. TN335/01 and TN335/01 were shown to be serologically and genetically very distant from the mass H120 vaccinal strain, but closely related to the CR88121 and D274 types. despite the application of a prophylactic program, the results were unsatisfactory. however, efforts are being made to identify and characterize field isolates using molecular tools. Specimens were homogenized with modified Eagle\u2019s medium. filtered through nonpyrogenic syringe filter before inoculation into allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. three eggs were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours, and the allantoic fluids were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. the aqueous phase containing RNA was mixed with 1 mL of absolute alcohol and 2 M sodium acetate. the precipitated RNA was pelleted at 12,000 g for 20 minutes and washed once with 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol. the pellet was dried and suspended in 20 L diethyl pyrocarbonate\u2013treated water. each sample was overlaid with water RNase free to a total volume of 100 L. the initial denaturation and the final polymerisation steps were at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes and 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. 1 minute, annealing at 49\u00b0C for 1 minute and polymerisation at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes. the predicted S1 band of 1.6 kb was cut from the gel and purified using the Gene Clean Kit (Bio101, Vista, CA) chickens with respiratory and kidney problems, from several broiler and layer commercial flocks, were sampled. the flocks were located in seven different regions from the northeast of the country. ifugation at 1500 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes and filtered through nonpyrogenic syringe filter (0.22 m) before inoculation into allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. three eggs were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours and the allantoic fluids were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. the precipitated RNA was pelleted at 12,000 g for 20 minutes and washed once with 70% ethanol. the pellet was dried and suspended in 20 L diethyl pyrocarbonate\u2013treated water. RT-PCR for nucleocapsid gene (N) detection Viral RNA was amplified by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction. the PCR was performed with 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 1 minute, and polymerisation at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes. the initial denaturation and the final polymerisation steps were at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes and 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. S1 band of 1.6 kb was cut from the gel and purified using the Gene Clean Kit. 1 L of the PCR product was amplified using the internal primers. the thermal profile of the second run of amplification was 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 45 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute. five IBVs were isolated from trachea, lungs, kidneys, and cecal tonsils from 4\u20135-week-old broiler chickens. despite a dual vaccination with MassH120, broilers from which isolates were recovered showed typical IB clinical symptoms. despite a dual vaccination with MassH120 strain, broilers from which isolates were recovered showed typical IB clinical symptoms.

TN200/01 shares the highest nucleotide and amino acid similarities with either TN296/07 (51% nucleotide and 59% amino acid identities) or TN556/07 (70% nucleotide and 77% amino acid identities) field isolates share and possess 12 identical amino acid substitutions as compared to H120 genotype, at amino acid positions 76, 78, 93, 103, 117, 120, 126, 130, 133, 133, 159, 167, and 173. the newly identified genotypes may express new serotypes. in vivo studies are useful to determine pathogenic characteristics of TN296/07 and TN556/07 genotypes. it is important to evaluate periodically the cross-protective capabilities of vaccines versus recent field isolates."}
