{"summary": "convalescent plasma or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) is a potential therapeutic option for serious viral infections. it is important to find a suitable source of convalescent plasma and of H-IVIG containing high titer neutralizing antibodies. the infections often result in pneumonia, which is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide and killed an estimated 935,000 children under the age of five in 2013. the availability of improved diagnostic tools has led to the identification in recent years of viruses as an increasingly frequent cause of pneumonia (2). intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is produced from a large pool of healthy volunteers with unknown NAb titers. it has been used clinically for preventing and treating specific virus infections. there may be high titers of NAbs against these pathogens in the adult population and, therefore, in IVIG. human immunoglobulin (pH4) for intravenous injection (IVIG) was diluted with Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco, China) before use. a total of ten bottles of human immunoglobulin (pH4) for intravenous injection (IVIG) from five production lots were used in this study. human serum samples from 96 healthy donors were collected at random in 2014 by Dongguan Children\u2019s Hospital in Dongguan, southern China. donors ranged in age from 20 to 49 years old with a sex ratio of 1:1 without any other patient identifier. virus type 71 GZ08 strain (Genebank No. FJ360545), coxsackie virus A16 GZ08 strain (Genebank No. FJ198212.1), human respiratory syncytial virus A strain Long (RSV) from ATCC (Genebank No. AY911262.1), infA strain PR8 (A/PR8/34, H1N1) from ATCC, human Ad55 Shanxi-Y16 strain (GenBank No. KF the healthy adult population of NAbs against respiratory viruses first, we wanted to evaluate the seroprevalence in healthy adults of NAbs against common respiratory viruses. we collected 96 serum samples from healthy donors and performed microneutralization assays to measure the titers of NAbs against several respiratory viruses. only 19.79% of the samples were positive for Ad55 NAbs, to the other five viruses the highest proportion of samples has NAb at titer 16\u2013128. the mean of NAbs titer were 221, 216, 158, 53, 61, 70 to InfA, Ad3, RSV, Ad55, EV71 and CA16, respectively. the NAb titers of total 96 sera samples were detected by neutralization tests in vitro against six respiratory viruses. 64 (66.67) 69 (71.88) 54 (56.25) Male 20 (41.66) 5 (10.42) 38 (79.16) 32 (66.67) 38 (79.16) 23 (47.92) Female 17 (35.42) 6 (12.5) 42 (87.50) 32 (66.67) 31 (64.58) 31(64.58) 129\u2013512 Total 23 (23.96) 4 (4.17) 7 (7.29) 6 (6.25) 7 (7.29) 18 (18.75) Male 15 (31.26) 2 (4.17) the percentage of samples that were positive for Ad55 NAbs increased with the age of the donors (P0.01) for the other tested viruses, there were no significant differences in the proportion of samples positive for NAbs between age groups. EV71 CA16 InfA Male 43 (89.58) 9 (18.75) 48 (100.00) 38 (79.17) 42 (87.50) 48 (100.00) Female 34 (70.83) 10 (20.83) 48 (100.00) 33 (68.75) 37 (77.08) 48 (100.00) NAbs against at least four of these five viruses. we collected 96 serum samples from healthy donors and performed microneutralization assays to measure the titers of NAbs against several respiratory viruses. a high proportion of samples from healthy adult donors were negative for NAbs (>16); to the other five viruses the highest proportion of samples has NAb. samples, 80 (83.33%), 64 (66.67%), and 69 (71.88%) had low but significant NAb titers [16\u2013128] for RSV, EV71, and CA16. only 19.79% of the samples were positive for Ad55 NAbs, but some of these had high (>512) titers. 0 (0.00) 10 (20.84) 6 (12.5) 0 (0.00) Female 14 (29.16) 38 (79.16) 0 (0.00) 15 (31.26) 11 (22.92) 0 (0.00) 16\u2013128 Total 37 (38.54) 11 (11.45) 80 (83.33) 64 (66.67) 69 (71.88) 54 (56.25) Male 20 (41.66) 5 (10.42) 38 (79.16) 23 (47.92) Female 17 (35.42) 6 (12.5) 42 ( the percentage of samples from age groups of 20\u201329, 30\u201339, and 40\u201349-year-old that were positive for Ad55 NAbs were 0%, 19.75%, and 40.625%, respectively. for the other tested viruses, there were no significant differences in the proportion of samples positive for NAbs between age groups. a total of 36 (37.5%) samples were positive for NAbs against all five of the most common viruses that were tested: RSV, EV71, CA16, Ad3, and InfA. all of the IVIG from different production lots had the same titers against the same viruses. IVIG also had a high NAb titer to Ad55 [2048], EV71 [160], and CA16 [160], which corresponds with the lower proportions of high NAb titer (>128) samples. it may be possible to treat ARI using convalescent plasma or serum IVIG. high rates of vaccination against and infection with InfA may explain our finding that the highest proportion of NAb positive samples was for this virus. a sizable proportion of the samples had high NAb titers against RSV (9.38%), EV71 (1.04%), CA16 (3.13%), and Ad55 (4.17%) the percentage of samples that were positive for NAbs against Ad55 increased with age (P0.01) for NAbs against other viruses, there were no significant differences in the positive proportions between age groups 20\u201329, 30\u201339, or 40\u201349 years. this trend agrees with previous work showing that Ad55 are often detected in the adult population. high-dose IVIG prepared from sera with high titer NAb against specific virus would have a much higher titer NAb against this virus, and then could be used at a low-dose. high-dose IVIG used in children may cause side effect, such as allergic reactions. commercial IVIG had high titer NAbs against Ad3, Ad55 and InfA. but low titer NAbs against RSV, EV71 and CA16. research provides useful data for further developing passive immunotherapy against SARIs."}
