{"summary": "Cryptococcosis most commonly presents as a meningoencephalitis that is fatal when untreated and that kills about 20% of the patients. the global burden of cryptococcosis exceeds 1 million cases a year, of whom about 600,000 die. most common infections are superficial infections of the oropharyngeal, esophageal, or vaginal mucosa and skin. macrophages are among the most important immune cells in controlling C. albicans cells in tissues and the bloodstream. autophagy is a mechanism by which cells recycle cytoplasmic material and organelles. s around pathogens found in the cytoplasm, such as Sindbis virus (22) or Listeria monocytogenes (39), leads to their clearance by lysosomal degradation. autophagy is also involved in the interaction between C. neoformans and macrophages. pEGFP-LC3 was a kind gift from Beth Levine (Dallas, TX) pEGFP-LC3 was a kind gift from Beth Levine (Dallas, TX) pEGFP-LC3 was a kind gift from noboru Mizushima (Tokyo, Japan) mice were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding five different small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that target ATG5 and one scrambled shRNA without targets in the murine genome. RNA interference was used to reduce expression of ATG5. cells were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2.5 104 cells per well. cells were infected with C. neoformans cells opsonized either with MAb 18B7 (10 g/ml) to the polysaccharide capsule of C. neoformans or with mouse serum complement (Pel-Freez) after 24 h of infection. shRNA-transduced cells were plated at 105 cells per well in an 8-chamber polystyrene tissue culture glass slide. yeast cells were added to the macrophage monolayer at an effector/target cell ratio of 1:5. cocultures were then washed with Hank's buffered saline solution. macrophages were lysed by forcibly pulling the culture through a 26-gauge needle 5 times. the lysates were serially diluted and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 37\u00b0C. all tests were repeated at least three times. the LC3 immunofluorescence microscopy experiments were repeated numerous times, with similar results. the live-imaging experiment was repeated at least three times. confocal images were manipulated on ImageJ and Photoshop software. all images were enhanced for contrast and brightness to highlight weak signal. cells were infected with C. neoformans at a 1:1 effector-to-target cell ratio. mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg of body weight xylazine. an incision was made on the neck, and 50 l of C. neoformans suspensions containing 2.5 104 to 106 C. neoformans strain H99 in PBS was injected into the trachea using a 250-l glass syringe and a 26-gauge needle. each survival the first sample to be quantified was prepared by plating the control and ATG5 shRNA-transduced J774.16 cells on petri dishes. the supernatant was then collected, centrifuged, filtered, supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche), and frozen until analyzed. the other samples were lung homogenates from the day 14 fungal burden assay described above. a cocktail of protease inhibitors was added to the homogenates. the analysis was performed with lung homogenates from five mice per group. nonlytic exocytosis results were compared by two-tailed chi-square test. survival in murine infection studies was compared by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using GraphPad Prism software. the conditional-knockout and control mice were obtained by crossing two animals homozygous for a flox-flanked ATG5 exon (ATG5flox) one of the mice was also heterozygous for the Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the lysozyme gene (Lyz Cre+) cells were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding five different small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that target ATG5 and one scrambled shRNA without targets in the murine genome. transduced cells were then selected and maintained in medium supplemented with 5 g/ml puromycin. after 24 h of infection, cells were lysed with distilled water. the number of viable C. neoformans cells was determined by counting of the CFU on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. the second assay measured phagocytosis kinetics and was performed according to a recently described method. the slides were gently washed with HBSS and stained with 0.01% acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 s. the slides were rinsed 3 times with PBS, mounted on microscope coverslips. the phagocytic index was determined by a fluorescence microscope. cell monolayers were coincubated for different times between 15 min and 24 h. the cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol at 20\u00b0C for 10 min and stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody to LC3. the labeling reaction was carried out overnight on an orbital shaker at 37\u00b0C. at approximately 24 h, cells were transferred to a glass-bottom 35-mm dish. the plates were then transferred to a heated-stage Perkin-Elmer UltraView RS-3 spinning-disk confocal microscope in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2. cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 2% uranyl acetate. cells were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. an incision was made on the neck, and 50 l of C. neoformans suspensions containing 2.5 104 to 106 C. neoformans strain H99 in PBS was injected into the trachea using a 250-l glass syringe and a 26-gauge needle. each survival experiment had at least 10 littermate mice of the same sex and age per group. the first sample to be quantified was prepared by plating the control and ATG5 cells on petri dishes and infecting with C. neoformans strain H99. the supernatant was then collected, centrifuged, filtered, supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors. the other samples were lung homogenates from the day 14 fungal burden assay described above. the lungs, spleen, liver, and brain were dissected, fixed in 10% neutral formalin, routinely processed to paraffin, sectioned (5 m), and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. samples for immunohistochemistry were sectioned to a thickness of 5 m and deparaffinized in xylene followed by graded alcohols. RESULTS Reduction in autophagy alters antifungal activity of macrophages. we reduced ATG5 expression with RNA interference. this was achieved with stable transduction of lentiviral vectors in J774.16 cells with shRNAs targeting different regions of the ATG5 gene. two different shRNA sequences targeting murine ATG5 were transduced into J774.16 cells (clones 30 and 31), as was a scrambled shRNA control (C) the proportion of ATG5 expression in comparison with the scrambled shRNA control was calculated by densitometry. bars represent the means of five independent experiments. each clone was incubated for 24 h with or without antibody-opsonized C. neoformans. the supernatants were used for cytokine quantification. the shRNA-transduced J774.16 cells were cultivated with or without antibody-opsonized C. neoformans for 24 h. the supernatants were collected to quantify 22 different cytokines and chemokines. an opposite trend was observed with the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL-10) autophagosome formation could be observed at as early as 30 min and as late as 24 h after infection but was most frequently observed at about 12 h after infection. at 12 h after infection, 36 of 44 macrophages with internalized C. neoformans contained the fungi in LC3-positive phagosomes. cells were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged LC3 for live imaging of C. neoformans phagocytosis. these movies confirmed with a different methodology that autophagosomes formed around C. neoformans hours after infection. inclusion of the endosomal marker 10-kDa dextran-Texas Red suggested that this structure was formed after fusion of small autophagosomes with the C. neoform two negative-control experiments confirmed that the observed signal came from macrophage LC3 surrounding the fungal cells. LC3 is recruited to phagosomes containing C. albicans at all time points tested between 15 min and 24 h. LC3 (green) was labeled by immunofluorescence. all images were collected by epifluorescence on a Zeiss microscope. LC3 is recruited to the membranes of most phagosomes shortly after phagocytosis. in contrast, in C. albicans-infected macrophages, the recruitment of LC3 takes a longer time. aliquot of the fungal cells that were used for infection was stained and imaged under identical conditions. a similar observation is apparent at the end of a movie in which we captured the autophagosome formation. a similar observation is apparent at the end of a movie in which we captured the autophagosome formation. 0.001 Cb 102,459 61,123 60 Clone 30 80,568 49,671 62 0.001 C 54,582 37,581 69 a P values were calculated by Fisher's exact test with the Yates correction. results were pooled from two independent experiments with clone 30 and three independent experiments with clone 31. we measured fungal burden, cytokine expression, and tissue inflammation in infected mice. cytokines with statistically significant differences in concentration in the lung homogenates were shown. cytokines with statistically significant differences in concentration were shown. mice had lower concentrations of IL-4, IL-13, MIP-1, and IP-10 in the lung homogenates than control mice. in both groups of mice, spleens and livers had no notable findings. the most striking findings were in the lungs of infected mice. ATG5 conditional knockout alters murine immune response to intratracheal C. neoformans infection. arrows point to infiltrated neutrophils with dense polymorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. arrowheads point to alveoli that are not occupied by C. neoformans. the results of the experimental cryptococcosis models suggest knocking out ATG5 in macrophages could alter the balance of classical and alternative activation of macrophages. the experimental cryptococcosis models suggested that knocking out ATG5 in macrophages could alter the balance of classical and alternative activation of macrophages. we found no significant effect of ATG5 knockdown in phagocytosis of C. albicans after 2 h of coincubation. at 24 h after incubation, ATG5 knockdown in J774.16 cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of fungistatic activity against both antibody (Ab)- and complement-opsonized C. neoformans killing assays could not be done with long coincubation times. antibody-opsonized C. neoformans phagocytosis after 2 h of coincubation using ATG5 shRNA-transfected J774.16 cells. bars represent the means and SEMs of 4 to 16 independent experiments. nonactivated BMMs showed better killing of C. neoformans when ATG5 was knocked out. autophagy knockdown decreased phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans. in activated BMMs, autophagy knockout decreased antifungal activity. 5 secreted more IL-6 after infection with C. neoformans. an opposite trend was observed with the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL-10), which was significantly reduced in the supernatants of ATG5 shRNA cells. we infected both cells and primary macrophages with C. neoformans or C. albicans and performed immunofluorescence against LC3, a specific autophagosome marker (18). fected with complement-opsonized C. neoformans at 12 h postinfection. LC3 localization in J774.16 cells infected with antibody-opsonized C. neoformans for 12 h. the endosomal marker 10-kDa dextran-Texas Red suggested that this structure was formed after fusion of lysosomes with the C. neoformans vacuole. the small autophagosomes that fused were not autophagolysosomes. transmission electron microscopy was used to search for ultrastructural hallmarks of autophagy such as vesicles with double membranes. albicans at all time points tested between 15 min and 24 h. some cells that were not fully phagocytosed were already LC3 positive. LC3 localization in cells infected with C. albicans for 2 h. autophagy knockdown reduces C. neoformans nonlytic exocytosis. a similar observation is apparent at the end of a movie in which we captured the autophagosome formation. two of the ATG5-knockdown J774.16 strains had 10% to 20% decreased rates of nonlytic exocytosis of C. neoformans Clone compared to the control cells. results were pooled from two independent experiments with clone 30 and three independent experiments with clone 31. knockout mice died faster than controls when infected intravenously with C. albicans. experiments were done using two different routes of infection (intraperitoneal and intratracheal) mice at different ranges of age and sex, but no statistically significant differences were found. 0.05 in the Bonferroni posttest followed a two-way ANOVA. we measured fungal burden, cytokine expression, and tissue inflammation in infected mice. the most striking findings were in the lungs of infected mice. only 2 of 5 ATG5-conditional-knockout mice had pyogranulomatous inflammation with intralesional C. neoformans. the inflammation in the knockout mice was less severe and contained notably fewer neutrophils than that in control mice. the arrows point to infiltrated neutrophils with dense polymorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. the arrowheads point to alveoli that are not occupied by C. neoformans or inflammatory cells in the lungs of conditional-knockout mice. the arrows point to clusters of alternatively activated macrophages on the lungs of control mice infected 3 and 14 days before. TG5-conditional-knockout mice have decreased lung fungal burden, decreased lung cytokines, less intense pyogranulomatous pneumonia, and delayed alternative activation of macrophages. our first experiment established the involvement of autophagy by disrupting the autophagic machinery. control cells efficiently phagocytosed and killed C. albicans. those with decreased autophagy were less able to ingest and control the pathogen. results suggest that macrophage response against C. albicans is mediated in part by autophagy. LC3-positive C. neoformans vacuoles were observed at as early as 30 min after infection but were more easily observed at later times of infection. Qin et al. also observed LC3-positive phagosomes containing C. neoformans in 40 to 60% of infected cells. phagosomes containing C. albicans acquire LC3 immediately, whereas the ones containing C. neoformans do not. in vitro macrophage autophagy is important in immunity against C. neoformans and C. albicans. autophagy works by encasement inside membranes that can then be fused with lysosomes for degradation. encasement helps host cell overcome pathogen-driven blockage of phagosomal maturation, acidification, and fusion with autophagosomes. autophagy inhibits antibody-opsonized C. neoformans by engulfing and digesting intracellular material that is then delivered to the fungal vacuole. antifungal mechanism affected by interference with ATG5 is autophagosome independent. absence of macrophage ATG5 impaired IFN-mediated recruitment of the Irga6 GTPase to the parasitophorous vacuole. this effect happened in spite of the fact that no LC3 was recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole. the chemokine is secreted by monocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. it increases chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages and natural killer, dendritic, and T cells. the chemokine is also involved in orchestrating neutrophilic pneumonia. LC3 antibody and membrane probe DiI stained exocytosed cells. none of the LC3-positive layers bound the probe, suggesting that only LC3 protein and not autophagosome membranes remained in exocytosed fungi. a similar finding was also reported by Qin et al. (37). macrophage autophagy is involved in several steps in the interaction of these cells with two different fungal pathogens, C. neoformans and C. albicans. autophagy is involved in various other neoplastic, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases. _index.html (2.1KB, html)."}
