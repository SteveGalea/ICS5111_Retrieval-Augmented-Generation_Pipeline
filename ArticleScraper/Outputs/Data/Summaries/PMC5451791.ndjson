{"summary": "a detailed description of human mobility is important for characterizing and forecasting the spatial and temporal spread of infectious diseases. the urgent need for accurate mobility data to inform epidemic models has been recently spotlighted during the 2014 west Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak [26,27] a few studies presenting a side-by-side comparison of different proxies for human mobility with applications to infectious disease modelling. these studies pointed out some important differences in estimates of human movements from mobile phone records when compared with official surveys or mobility models. the overall network topology is usually well captured by mobile phone data, with differences mainly affecting less connected or less populated areas. the census commuting network is extracted from the database of the french national institute of statistics and economic studies. a full database is generated by assembling five surveys conducted on five consecutive years, resulting in an overall coverage of 40% of the population in municipalities with more than 10 000 inhabitants. the census commuting network and the mobile phone commuting network are comparable. we rescaled the population of each district by the population sampling ratio n i mp / n i c. each weight wmpij of the mobile phone network is rescaled by the same factor. the final mobile phone commuting network has 329 nodes. the metapopulation model is a spatially structured model where the whole population is divided into sub-populations connected by mobility fluxes. we consider a rapidly transmitted infection, such as an influenza-like-illness (ILI), whose spatial spread was found to correlate with commuting movements. each day of a simulation is considered as a typical working day. we define the number of susceptible, infected and recovered who live in district i and work in district j as Sij, Iij and Rij. probability of success equals the force of infection i of the node. i i + j i S j i systematically considered each of the 329 network nodes as the initial seed of simulated outbreaks. each seed we ran 1000 stochastic realizations on both networks, thus resulting in 658 000 simulated epidemics. each simulation is initialized with a number of infected individuals in the seed node equal to 10. network t i M and t i C was computed to measure the strength of monotonic relationship between the mean arrival times in the two networks, for each seed s. we used a non-parametric measure to focus on the temporal ordering of the infected sub-populations. we used the Pearson correlation coefficient to correlate all the values of rs and J(s,M,C) with a number of centrality measures characterizing the seed. we considered the following features measured on both mobility networks and labelled as M and C to identify the mobile phone network and the census network. 2.9 Loyalty takes values in the interval [0,1], with =0 indicating that no neighbours are retained, and =1 that exactly the same set of neighbours is preserved. Eventually, we compared our results against node variables that are not directly related to the network structure. census commuting network and mobile phone commuting network compared simulated epidemics based on movements of commuters. a full database is generated by assembling five surveys conducted on five consecutive years, resulting in an overall coverage of about 40% of the population in municipalities with more than 10 000 inhabitants. a user\u2019s home place is the most frequently visited tower-cell in terms of placed calls. a user\u2019s workplace is the second most visited tower-cell. we rescaled the population of each district by the population sampling ratio n i mp / n i c. the metapopulation model is a spatially structured model where the whole population is divided into sub-populations connected by mobility fluxes. the reaction process takes place in each node of the network where individuals are assumed to be in homogeneous mixing. the natural history of the disease is described by a SIR compartmental model with no demography. the force of infection and the number of infected individuals in each node vary in time and depend on the part of the day we are considering. we define the number of susceptible, infected and recovered who live in district i and work in district j as Sij, Iij and Rij. each seed we ran 1000 stochastic realizations on both networks. we calculated the average arrival time in each sub-population i over the 1000 model realizations for a given seed in the mobile phone network t i. between t i M and t i C was computed to measure the strength of monotonic relationship between the mean arrival times in the two networks, for each seed s. we used a non-parametric measure to focus on the temporal ordering of the infected sub-populations. we used the Pearson correlation coefficient to correlate all the values of rs and J(s,M,C) with a number of centrality measures characterizing the seed s. the node degree ki, defined as the number of edges in the graph that are incident on node i and that can be ingoing, outgoing or the sum of the two. 2.9 Loyalty takes values in the interval [0,1], with =0 indicating that no neighbours are retained, and =1 that exactly the same set of neighbours is preserved. we compared our results against node variables that are not directly related to the network structure. the temporal hierarchy of the epidemics was found to be very similar between the two networks with rs>0.69 for every seed s of the network. the similarity between the spatial infection patterns on the two networks was more widely distributed with values of the Jaccard index ranging between J=0.13 and J=0.46, with average J = 0.27. both histograms correspond to 329 binned values, one for each node of the commuting networks, and solid lines indicate the average of the distributions. the similarity of both spatial and temporal epidemic patterns was mainly driven by a few features of the outbreak seed that were in general positively correlated with each other. 105 0.661 p105 kCout 0.527 p105 0.723 p105 kMout 0.480 p105 0.765 p105 kMtot 0.480 p105 0.765 p105 kMtot 0.462 p105 0.680 p105 | k in C k in M | 0.141 0.01 0.262 p105 | k tot C k tot M | k tot C 0.349 tot 0.380 p105 0.560 p105 | T in C T in M | 0.443 p105 0.620 p105 | T out C T out M | 0.451 p105 0.667 p105 | T out C T out M | T out C 0.468 p105 0.140 0.01 | T tot C T tot M | T tot C 0.562 p105 0.295 p105 Table 3.

Discussion In this study, we systematically evaluated the goodness of a large-scale mobile phone dataset to represent commuting movements in France. the seed node was based on a limited exploration of different initial conditions. the best predictive models were based on several variables and hundreds of models were found to be statistically equivalent based on their AIC values. it was not possible to identify a parsimonious set of characteristics of the seed node that alone would best predict the epidemic outcomes on both networks. data from travel or migration surveys in a low-income setting could be aligned to a high degree. a better match could be obtained by refining the normalization procedure and by identifying more accurately home and work locations by including more metadata. however, we do not expect these refinements to impact significantly on our results. a significant amount of research in the past decade has clearly highlighted the fact that one single source of mobility data cannot provide a full and comprehensive description of human movements across all spatio-temporal scales that are relevant for infectious disease transmission. there is no a priori correct level of aggregation for analysis of human mobility and infectious disease dynamics. all authors revised and approved the final version of the manuscript.
