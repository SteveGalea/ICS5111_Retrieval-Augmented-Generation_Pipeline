{"summary": "RPISeq is a family of classifiers for predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information. the RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition. the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. RNA-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. RPISeq is free as a web-based server at http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/. only a few studies to date have focused on the \"partner prediction problem\" i.e., identification of specific RNA interaction partner(s) for a known RNA binding protein, or protein binding partner(s) for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), these experiments are expensive and time-consuming. t triad Feature (CTF) representation encodes each protein sequence using the normalized 3-gram frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence. the choice of k = 3 yielded the best results. performance of classifiers estimated using 10-fold cross-validation is considerably better than that estimated using the larger RPI2241 dataset. the results were not significantly different from 10-fold cross-validation experiments using the larger RPI2241 dataset. ROC AUCs of 0.97 (RF) and 0.92 (SVM) were obtained for predictions on the RPI2241 dataset. lower values of 0.85 (RF) and 0.81 (SVM) were obtained on the RPI369 dataset. RPISeq classifiers used only sequence information from the RNA and protein as input. mRNA half-life, predicted protein secondary structure, gene ontology annotation, relative abundance of each amino acid, codon bias. pancaldi and B\u00e4hler reported an average accuracy of 70% in 2-fold cross-validation tests using an RF classifier based on 500 trees. 5-fold and leave-one-out experiments gave comparable results. RPISeq could be useful for constructing networks of ncRNA-protein interactions. ncRNA-protein interactions may not be available in many cases. RPISeq could be used to predict ncRNA-protein interactions.

RPISeq predictions made using classifiers trained on the RPI369 dataset are shown. RPISeq-RF and RPISeq-SVM classifiers correctly predicted all except 5 and 2 edges. a protein hub highlighted in yellow shows interactions of an snRNA (u4560) with various Sm-like proteins in the LSM complex. RNA hubs correspond to snRNA u4560, which interacts with various Sm-like proteins in the LSM complex [39]. RF classifiers trained on the RPI369 dataset correctly identified all 8 RNA interaction partners of the SEN-1 helicase. both classifiers missed only 1 of 8 protein interaction partners of the snRNA u4560. the performance of classifiers estimated using 10-fold cross-validation on the larger RPI2241 dataset is considerably better than that estimated using the RPI369 dataset. the results were not significantly different from 10-fold cross-validation experiments. RPISeq-RF (random forest) and RPISeq-SVM (support vector machine) classifiers used two datasets, RPI2241 and RPI369. the area under the curve (AUC) of each ROC is shown next to the curve. our RF classifier achieved an accuracy of 68%, based on 500 trees. the results were comparable to the 70% reported for the RF classifier of pancaldi and B\u00e4hler [36]. RPISeq was used to construct non-coding RNA-protein networks for several different organisms. ncRNA-protein and transcription factor-gene regulatory networks do not include any pairs derived from ribosomes. RF classifier correctly predicted 80% (1,349 of 1,681 total interactions) RPISeq predictions on interactions derived from the NPInter database for five model organisms. the best \"overall\" prediction performance was obtained using the SVM classifier trained on the RPI369 dataset (which lacks ribosomal sequence bias) RF classifier trained on the RPI2241 dataset correctly predicted 80.2% of the total interactions. differences in performance of classifiers trained on the two different datasets are significant when predictions for each model organism are considered individually. for yeast RPIs, both the RF and SVM classifiers trained on RPI2241 generated excellent predictions, 98.0% and 99.2% respectively. one of several RNA hubs, highlighted in purple, illustrates interactions of an snRNA (u4560) with various Sm-like proteins in the LSM complex. RPISeq-RF classifier correctly predicted 168 (66%) and RPISeq-SVM correctly predicted 226 (89%). a protein hub highlighted in yellow shows interactions of a helicase (SEN1) with several snoRNAs. RF and SVM classifiers trained on the RPI369 dataset correctly identified all 8 RNA interaction partners of the SEN-1 helicase. both classifiers missed only 1 of 8 protein interaction partners of the snRNA u4560. RPISeq can effectively predict RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information, with up to 90% average accuracy. RPISeq requires only sequence information to generate predictions. in the current version of RPISeq, classifiers were trained using only RPIs for which experimental structures are available. rRNA-ribosomal protein pairs constitute 40% of the total. classifiers trained on RPI369 had better prediction performance. the four most frequently selected RNA tetrads were: AUUC, AGUG, UUUU and UCAA. the most frequently selected conjoint triad in protein sequences was I, L, F, PA, G, VR, K. the method of pancaldi and B\u00e4hler [36] was developed to predict mRNA-protein interactions (rather than ncRNA-protein interactions), also uses RF and SVM classifiers. RPISeq methods do not suffer from this limitation because they require only sequence-derived features to make reliable predictions. RPISeq-RF classifiers trained on the RPI2241 dataset correctly predicted > 98% of interactions in the NPInter database. the RPISeq-RF classifier correctly identified 83% of interactions in human and 93% in the mouse networks. RNA-protein pairs not included in NPInter could correspond to false positives. mRNA partners for only a handful of RBPs are known. RPISeq requires only sequence information to generate predictions. rRNA-ribosomal protein pairs constitute 40% of the total. PI2241 and RPI369 were non-redundant benchmark datasets. classifiers trained on the larger dataset had superior prediction performance. RPISeq accurately predicted RPIs in cross-validation experiments. the method of pancaldi and B\u00e4hler [36] was developed to predict mRNA-protein interactions (rather than ncRNA-protein interactions), also uses RF and SVM classifiers, but requires a much more extensive set of features. RPISeq methods do not suffer from this limitation because they require only sequence-derived features. the networks were extracted from the \"ncRNA binds protein\" category of NPInter. RPISeq was able to successfully predict interactions of a single protein with multiple RNAs. both the RF and SVM classifiers trained on the RPI2241 dataset correctly predicted > 98% of interactions. RPISeq is a family of purely sequence-based classifiers. results show that the corresponding RNA and protein sequences alone contain sufficient information to allow reliable prediction of RPIs. these predictions can be used to identify putative RNA partners of a target protein, or protein partners of a target RNA. interacting with similar RNA sequences were discarded. only proteins whose length is greater than 25 and RNAs at least 15 nucleotides long were retained. this resulted in a dataset of \"positive\" examples, RPI2241,. pancaldi and B\u00e4hler were not able to evaluate their method on this larger dataset because of missing feature information for RNAs and proteins involved in these interactions. the second dataset is larger, consisting of 13,243 RPIs, and includes all 5,166 interactions in the smaller dataset. RNA sequences are represented by a 343 (7 7 7) dimensional vector. each element of the vector corresponds to the normalized frequency of the corresponding 3-mer in the sequence. the input to the SVM classifier is a 599-dimensional vector that encodes features of. the output of the SVM is a binary label indicating whether the given RNA-protein pair interact or not. we chose the normalized polykernel function of order 2 with = 1.0E-12. we set C = 1.0 and tolerance parameter T = 0.0010. p r e c i s i o n = T P T P + F P R e c a l l = T P T P + F N A c c u r a c y = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N F - M e a s u r e = 2 P r e c i s i o n = 43 complexes from PRIDB contained a total of 9,689 protein chains and 2,074 RNA chains. the final dataset RPI2241 was derived from these complexes by applying the following criteria. only proteins whose length is greater than 25 and RNAs at least 15 nucleotides long were retained. we used two datasets of RPIs obtained from RNA immunoaffinity purification and microarray experiments. one dataset comprises 5,166 mRNA-protein interactions. this dataset was also used in the study of pancaldi and B\u00e4hler. each protein feature represents the normalized frequency of the corresponding conjoint triad, i.e., 3-mer in the 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence. each element of the vector corresponds to the normalized frequency of the corresponding 3-mer in the sequence. the input to the SVM classifier is a 599-dimensional vector that encodes features of a given pair of RNA and protein sequences. the output of the SVM is a binary label indicating whether the given RNA-protein pair interact or not. we used the randomforest implementation in weka 3.7 [48] to train the SVM classifier. performance evaluation standard 10-fold cross-validation procedures were used to evaluate and compare classifier performance on the benchmark datasets. for the RF classifier, we also performed leave-one-out cross-validation. results were not significantly different from those obtained using 10-fold cross-validation.
