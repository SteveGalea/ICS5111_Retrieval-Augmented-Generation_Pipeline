{"summary": "minipool NAT screening was introduced in 1997 for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in 2000 for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (4). only 60 L of extract is needed for routine NAT screening. different dilutions of the external influenza (H5N1) subtype quantification standard were prepared. each dilution was repeatedly spiked and tested in 8 minipools. each dilution was repeatedly spiked and tested in 9.5-mL negative plasma pools. PFU (H5N1) spiked in minipools No. positive/ no. tested % Positive 125.0 8/8 100 62.5 8/8 100 31.3 8/8 100 15.6 8/8 100 7.8 7/8 87.5 3.9 7/8 87.5 1.9 4/8 50 0.9 3/8 37.5 0.0 0/8 0 *Influenza (H5N1) standard was extracted from 9.6 mL of 96 pooled donor samples after centrifugation. sensitivity was expressed as PFU/mL and can be converted into viral genome copy number according to the calculation of Yoshikawa et al. (7). after screening 10,272 samples by minipool NAT, none of the samples were found to be infected by influenza. the viremia level in the donor is below the analytical sensitivity of the screening assay. a selective infectious dose NAT strategy might be necessary to reduce this risk. implementation of WNV-NAT in the united states in 2003 interdicted well over 1,000 donations from persons infected with WNV."}
