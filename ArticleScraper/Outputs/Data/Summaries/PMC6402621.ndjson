{"summary": "PEDV is a coronavirus (CoV) with a positive-sense RNA genome of 28 kb. its genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab. mortality in infected piglets aged below one week is especially high. PEDV entry is mediated by S protein. cleaved by viral proteases into non-structural proteins involved in subsequent viral RNA transcription and replication. coV N proteins may act as RNA chaperones [12, 13]. PEDV N has been shown to inhibit interferon- (IFN-) production and interferon-stimulating gene (ISG) expression via suppression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [20]. in some PEDV strains, N is an unusual substrate of PEDV 3C-like protease (3Cpro) pCAGGS-PEDV N-Myc, pCAGGS-PEDV N-BP and pCAGSS-PEDV N-NP were described previously [21, 22]. an infectious clone for PEDV-AVCT12S.YN144-mCherry was a kind gift from A. Wanitchang and A. Jongkaewwattana (unpublished results). transfection mixture was supplemented with pCAGGS vector to 2 g plasmid. at 24 hpt, transfected cells were washed twice with PBS. lentiviruses encoding PEDV nucleocapsid proteins were recovered. vero E6 and vero E6-N cells were seeded at 2x104 cells/well in 96-well plates and left to grow at 37 oC with 5% CO2. at indicated time after seeding, 3.125 g resazurin was added to each well. plates were then incubated at 37 oC for 6 h. 96-well plates were adsorbed for 1 h with 100 l of serially diluted virus (8 wells per each dilution) at 72 hpi, the infected cells were scored by mCherry expression under a fluorescence microscope. one-step RT-qPCR was performed using a viral nucleic acid extraction kit. total RNA was extracted from vero E6 or vero E6-N cells infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) at indicated time points using the RNA extraction kit. one-step RT-qPCR was performed as described above, except with Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR mix (New England Biolabs) PEDV N was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-PEDV N antibody. PRRSV N protein was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-NP antibody. transfection mixture was supplemented with pCAGGS vector to 2 g plasmid. fixed cells were washed 3 times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)+10% FBS in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. cells were incubated with 1:500 primary antibodies for 2 h, washed 5 times with 0.05% tween-20 in PBS, and stained with 1:1000 secondary antibodies. asterisks represent p-values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. no asterisk indicates p-values of > 0.05. an infectious clone for PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry was described previously. infected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and supplemented with 2ml OptiMEM with 0.1% TrypLE. at indicated time points, infected cells were imaged on a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) and culture supernatants were harvested for viral RNA production analysis by RT-qPCR as described below. transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and supplemented with 0.1% TrypLE. at 48 h post-infection, culture supernatants were harvested for viral RNA production analysis. lentiviruses encoding PEDV nucleocapsid proteins were recovered based on method described previously. 125 g resazurin was added to each well, and the plates were then incubated at 37 oC for 6 h. values shown were averagesSEM from three biological replicates. mCherry expression monitored extent of PEDV replication. RT-qPCR was performed using an iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step Kit (BioRad, USA) in a 20-l reaction with 5 l of the extracted RNA as a template in a CFX96 Thermal cycler with the following condition: 50\u00b0C, 30 min; 95\u00b0C, 1 min; and 40 cycles of [95\u00b0C, 15 s; 60\u00b0C, 60 s]. one-step RT-qPCR was performed except with Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR mix (New England Biolabs) to quantify the levels of genomic RNA, we used primers specific to ORF1 (fwd: 5\u2019-AGTACGGGGCTCTAGTGCAG and rev: 5\u2019-TAACCACCCAAAACGACGCGG; [28]) PEDV S was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-S1 antibody. PRRSV N protein was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-NP antibody (Southern Biotechnology) cells were incubated with 1:500 primary antibodies for 2 h, washed 5 times with 0.05% tween-20 in PBS. fluorescence images of stained cells were taken on florescence microscope (Olympus lx73) reverse-genetics rescue of PEDV for different CoVs. there have been conflicting evidence whether nucleocapsid protein expression is required for viral recovery from infectious DNA or RNA. capped PEDV N transcripts were included during recovery of PEDV PC22A from in vitro-transcribed full-length PEDV RNA. PEDV infectious clones produced N at the level too low for detection by Western blotting. we quantitatively monitored viral replication by the extent of mCherry expression and syncytium formation. expression of N-L381P from the plasmid increased the number of viral progenies by three orders of magnitude. hek 293T cells were co-transfected with pPEDV-mCh (RG PEDV-WT) or pPEDV-mChN.L381P (RG PEDV-mt) and pCAGGS-N (or an empty vector) at 48 hpt, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PEDV N antibody (A) supernatants were harvested for viral titer determination by RT-q exogenous PEDV N expression enhances viral production during the reverse genetics step from an infectious DNA clone for both wild-type and slow-growing variant. we transfected vero E6 cells with either pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS expressing myc-tagged PEDV N 24 h prior to infection by PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry. vero E6 cells transiently expressing PEDV improve PEDV replication. this argued for a direct effect of ectopic PEDV N expression on PEDV replication within the same cells. growth enhancement of PEDV variants in vero E6 cells stably expressing PEDV N results from previous sections opened up a possibility that cells expressing PEDV N might be an improved platform for PEDV seed vaccine generation. PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry and PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry were studied. equal numbers of cells were infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry or PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) at 48 hpi, no significant difference in titers was observed between supernatants. the peak titer at 36 hpi reached mid-105 TCID50/ml. at 48 hpi, no significant difference in titers was observed. PEDV N increases viral RNA synthesis in infected cells. to measure genome replication activity, we used primers specific to ORF1. levels of sgmRNA were normalized to levels of GAPDH mRNA. overexpression of PEDV N enhances viral sgmRNA transcription. vero E6 or vero E6-N cells were infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) and analyzed at indicated time post-infection. pPEDV-mChS.YN144 plasmid showed significant increase in viral RNA titers if PEDV N was present during recovery phase in HEK 293T cells. RT-qPCR quantification of released particles showed significant increase in viral RNA titers if PEDV N was present during the recovery phase. at 48 hpt, supernatants were harvested and adsorbed onto vero E6 cells. at 60 hpi, supernatants were harvested for viral titer determination by RT-qPCR. western blot analysis on infected cell lyases did not reveal drastic difference in viral protein production for either virus. this could be due to the lower sensitivity of Western blotting compared to vRNA quantification by RT-qPCR. PEDV N-mediated enhancement in viral replication is much more pronounced on PEDV replication than it is on other viruses. pCAGGS plasmid expressing either PEDV N (WT), PEDV N-L381P or no protein (vec) subsequently detected the recovered progenies in vero E6 cells. this infectious clone contains the mCherry coding sequence in place of ORF3 [22]. reverse genetics rescue of PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry was less efficient than its wild-type counterpart. expression of both forms of PEDV N during reverse genetics rescue step could significantly enhance subsequent syncytium formation. atants were harvested for viral titer determination by RT-qPCR. pCAGGS expressing PEDV N derived from field strains (D) compared the viral progenies produced from pPEDV-mCh co-transfection with those from co-transfection. infection by PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry faded upon cell fixation. fluorescence of the virally-expressing mCherry allowed much more profound PEDV replication at 36 hpi compared to untransfected Vero E6 cells. at 24 hpt, PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry were adsorbed onto transfected cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates prepared at 48 hpi. values are averagesSEM of three independent experiments. viability assay, vero E6 and vero E6-N cells showed similar growth kinetics. PEDV N expression in these cells was verified by Western blotting. in some cells, PEDV N was observed as punctae inside the nuclei. PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry spread much faster in vero E6-N cells. by 24\u201336 hpi, large syncytia were ubiquitously observed. by 48 hpi, almost all cells were dead and detached from the plate. at 48 hpi, no significant difference in titers was observed between supernatants from the two cells. however, the virus replicating in vero E6-N cells showed a peak titer of 104 TCID50/ml at this time, 10-fold lower than that observed in vero E6-N cells at 36 hpi. o E6 or vero E6-N cells were infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) at indicated time points. levels of each RNA species were normalized to the levels of GAPDH mRNA from the same conditions. vero E6-N cells showed slight increase in the levels of genomic RNA at 24 hpi, but the difference disappeared by 36 hpi. lysates were analyzed with western blotting with anti-S1 antibody. a vaccine candidate with a spike gene derived from the strain YN144 was generated. this variant grew slightly more slowly than the wild-type PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry. replication was monitored by formation of mCherry-positive syncytium formation and the TCID50 assay over time. mCherry-positive syncytia replicated noticeably more slowly than its parental strain. mCherry-positive syncytia also revealed more robust replication in vero E6-N cells compared to vero E6 cells. infected cells were infected with IAV (MOI 0.001) or PRRSV (MOI 0.01). a slight increase ( 1-log) in PRRSV RNA titers was observed in vero E6-N cells. vero E6 or vero E6-N cells were infected with IAV (A) or PRRSV (B) supernatants of infected cells were harvested for viral RNA titer determination by RT-qPCR. BAC-based PEDV reverse genetics system could recover the virus without an extraneous N-expressing plasmid [22] exogenous N protein, although not necessary, can significantly enhance PEDV rescue titers from the BAC system. this report shows the importance of N in efficient transcription and replication of coVs. ectopic PEDV N expression affects viral RNA synthesis during infection. enhancement of subgenomic RNA production could be the primary mechanism of the PEDV N-mediated viral growth enhancement. replicon activity could be observed only from replicons harboring the N gene. we showed that expression of PEDV N can enhance rescue and replication kinetics of PEDV. we observed both higher peak titers and/or shorter culture time to reach peak titers. this could lead to significant cost reduction during manufacturing processes."}
