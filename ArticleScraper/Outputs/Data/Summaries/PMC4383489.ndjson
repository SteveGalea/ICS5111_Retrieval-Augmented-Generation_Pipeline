{"summary": "an early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control. an early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control. the world health organisation has a stated goal of reducing global dengue mortality by 50% by 2020. the th-6th day of illness is the commonest life-threatening complication of dengue. it\u2019s widely held that the case-incidence of DSS can be reduced via careful monitoring and the judicious use of parenteral fluids to maintain an adequate intravascular volume. the therapeutic window of opportunity for a dengue antiviral drug lies in the first 48\u201372 hours of illness. the results provide pragmatic methods to enhance the early diagnosis of dengue in primary care settings. the study protocol was approved by the Hospital for Tropical Diseases scientific and ethical committee and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethical Committee (OXTREC 35\u201310) blood samples were drawn for routine hematology, biochemistry and NS1 rapid test. all enrolment plasma samples were tested with a validated quantitative RT-PCR assay to detect DENV RNA. IgM ELISA serology was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. patients who had paired plasma samples were negative in both the DENV RT-PCR assay and Platelia Dengue NS1 ELISA. any patient who was DENV RT-PCR negative, NS1 ELISA negative and did not IgM seroconvert in paired plasma samples was classified as a laboratory-confirmed dengue case. a detailed assessment of the model assumptions of linearity and additivity was performed. the model was then simplified using step-wise backwards selection. alternative statistical models such as classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) were also investigated in order to find an optimal diagnostic algorithm. the protocol was approved by the Hospital for Tropical Diseases scientific and ethical committee and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethical Committee. the accompanying parent/guardian of each child provided written informed consent. a patient presenting to one of the study sites was eligible for enrolment if they met the following inclusion criteria. all NS1 rapid tests (NS1 Ag STRIP, BioRad) were performed on the same day of patient enrolment. a 2nd blood sample for the purposes of serology was collected from all patients that were hospitalized anytime during their acute illness. the randomization code to select ambulatory cases for follow-up was generated by software. IgM seroconversion was defined as a change in the MAC ELISA test result from negative to positive in paired plasma samples. any patient who was DENV RT-PCR negative and NS1 ELISA negative at the time of enrolment was classified as a \u201cpresumptive not-dengue\u201d case. a detailed assessment of the model assumptions of linearity and additivity was performed (S1 Text) the model was then simplified using step-wise backwards selection. alternative statistical models such as classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) were also investigated in order to find an optimal diagnostic algorithm. population 5729 children with fever of less than 72 hours were enrolled at one of the seven clinical study sites in southern Vietnam between October 2010 and December 2012. 1692 (29.6%) participants had laboratory-confirmed dengue. the baseline characteristics of the dengue and non-dengue cases are shown in Table 1. Notably, dengue cases were older than non-dengue cases. the NS1 Ag Strip test had a sensitivity of 70.4% (95%CI: 68.2\u201372.6%), specificity of 99.2% (95%CI: 98.9\u201399.5%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.4% (95%CI: 96.3\u201398.2%), and negative predictive value of 88.9% (95%CI: 87.9\u201389.8%) NS1 detection was strongly associated with the concentration of DENV RNA in the same plasma sample. the odds of NS1 detection increased by 1.8 (95%CI: 1.6\u20131.9) for each 10-fold higher DENV RNA concentration. these data define the strengths and weaknesses of NS1 rapid testing. the most parsimonious model, derived from stability selection, used the patient\u2019s age, white cell count and platelet count at the time of enrolment to classify dengue from non-dengue cases. the most parsimonious model, derived from stability selection, had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0\u201376). sensitivity of 72.9% (95% CI: 69.6\u201376.6%) for DENV1, 74.7% (95%CI: 71.0\u201379.7%) for DENV2, 68.4% (95%CI: 59.2\u201374.5%) for DENV3 and 78.2% (95%CI: 75.5\u201383.3%) for DENV4 infection. - - History and clinical characteristics Day of illness (+1 day) 1.45 1.34\u20131.56 0.001 0.78 0.70\u20130.87 0.001 - - - - Temperature (by +1\u00b0C) 1.23 1.14\u20131.32 0.001 1.28 1.16\u20131.40 0.001 - - - Vomiting = Yes 1.37 1.22\u20131.54 0.001 1.31 1.12\u20131.52 0.001 - - - Abdominal pain 87 0.86\u20130.88 0.001 0.97 0.95\u20130.98 0.001 0.94 0.93\u20130.95 0.001 HCT (+1%) 1.12 1.10\u20131.14 0.001 0.97 0.95\u20130.99 0.013 - - - - AST (per 2-fold increase) 3.65 3.23\u20134.14 0.001 3.50 2.97\u20134.13 0.001 - - - - CK (per 2-fold increase) 1.33 1.24\u20131.4 a composite test had sensitivity of 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4\u201392.9%) and the specificity was 75.7% (95%CI: 74.5\u201377.0%). a cut-off of 50% would lead to a sensitivity of 86.0% (95%CI: 84.5\u201387.6%) and specificity of 89.6% (95%CI: 88.7\u201390.5%) a horizontal line from a predictor value to the \u201cPoints\u201d axis assigns points to the 3 required variables age, platelet count (PLT) and white blood cell count (WBC) the sum of these points can then be translated to the corresponding predicted risk of dengue. 16.4 (14.6\u201318.9) 15.6 (14.1\u201317.6) History and clinical characteristics Day of illness 1 361 (21.3%) 1232 (30.7%) 2 692 (40.9%) 1732 (43.1%) 3 639 (37.8%) 1051 (26.2%) Temperature (\u00b0C) 38.5 (38\u201339) 38.4 (37.8\u201339.0) Vomiting (n, %) 737 (43.6%) 1442 (35.9%) Abdominal pain (n, %) NS1 Ag Strip test had a sensitivity of 70.4% (95%CI: 68.2\u201372.6%), specificity of 99.2% (95%CI: 98.9\u201399.5%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.4% (95%CI: 1.6\u20131.9) for each 10-fold higher DENV RNA concentration. odds of NS1 detection increased by 1.8 (95%CI: 1.6\u20131.9) for each 10-fold higher DENV RNA concentration. there were 77 dengue cases where the infecting serotype was unknown. there were 77 dengue cases where the infecting serotype was unknown. the most parsimonious model, herein called the Early Dengue Classifier (EDC), had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0\u201376.8%), specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2\u201377.6%), positive predictive value of 57.1% (95%CI: 56.2\u201359.0%), and negative predictive value of 87.8% (95%CI: 86.8\u201388.5%) for correctly classifying dengue cases in the entire the overall performance characteristics of the EDC under temporal, leave-one-site-out validation or seasonality are summarized in S5 Table. the results suggest that in settings where NS1 rapid tests are not routinely available, the EDC could assist primary care physicians in dengue diagnosis. - - Rash = Yes 2.02 1.75\u20132.34 0.001 1.37 1.11\u20131.69 0.003 - - - Hepatomegaly = Yes 2.85 0.87\u20139.36 0.086 0.58 0.05\u20137.08 0.687 - - - - Rash = Yes 2.02 1.75\u20132.34 0.001 1.23 0.78\u20131.93 0.381 - - - - Injection = Yes 2.40 2.05\u20132.81 Figure A displays possible sensitivity/specificity trade-offs for different cut-off values and the distance from the corresponding points on the ROC curve to the upper left corner. it displays a scatterplot-smoother of predicted versus observed risks (dotted line) and predicted versus observed risks for ten patient strata of equal size grouped according to predicted risks (triangles) the predicted risk of dengue is larger than 33.3% so the patient would be classified as dengue positive. a 9-year-old patient with a PLT of 100x103/mm3 and a WBC of 5x103/mm3 has a total points score of 15+32+84 = 131. the predicted risk of dengue is larger than 33.3% so the patient would be classified as dengue positive. the NS1 rapid test, a stand-alone diagnostic classifier and the combination of NS1 rapid test and diagnostic classifier together. results highlight the utility of NS1 rapid tests for an early specific diagnosis, yet also remind that 2nd generation tests are needed with improved sensitivity. NS1 rapid diagnostic tests for malaria are an example of how improvements to assay performance can lead to recognition as a diagnostic standard of care. only three prospective studies have considered dengue diagnostic algorithms exclusively in children. most diagnostic studies failed to report positive and negative predictive values for their diagnostic algorithms. an early diagnosis of dengue can assist in patient triage and management by directing clinical/caregiver attention to clinical warning signs and/or the appearance of capillary permeability. early diagnosis could support measures to prevent further transmission, e.g. by using topical repellents and local mosquito control.
