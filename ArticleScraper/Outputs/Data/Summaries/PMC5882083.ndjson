{"summary": "the development and manufacture of biologicals and advanced therapy medicinal products employs various cell lines, raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients. potential viral contaminants may enter biological production processes from cell lines or raw materials thus posing a risk to downstream applications and to drug safety. the risk of viral contamination must therefore be mitigated by stringent testing at the appropriate stages of production. infection with ZIKV in the majority (80\u201390 %) of healthy humans is asymptomatic. it can progress to neurological complications, such as encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults and birth defects. as of 2016 ZIKV is present in many countries in Africa, Asia and across the Americas. raw material of human origin from affected areas should be considered as potentially contaminated with ZIKV. this includes, but not limited to, blood and blood components (plasma, platelets, convalescent serum, monocytes, heterologous T cells, monocytes, coagulating factors, immunoglobulins). limited epidemiologic surveillance evidence suggests that ZIKV infection in wider mammal species may be possible. clonal selection of cells lines by cell sorting with antibodies or antisera from animal species (goats) biological materials are tested by in vitro assays for the detection of adventitious viruses. this includes clonal selection of cells lines by cell sorting with antibodies or antisera from animal species (goats) transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and risk for manufacturing of biologicals and advanced therapy medicinal products. in nature, ZIKV circulates through a sylvatic cycle involving multiple mosquito species (primarily from the Aedes family) and primates. MRC-5 cells demonstrated early signs of CPE following inoculation with 100 TCID50 of ZIKV MR766 at 6 days post inoculation (pi) with the mean appearance of CPE at day 13. MRC-5 cells demonstrated early signs of CPE following inoculation with 100 TCID50 of ZIKV MR766 at 6 days post infection (pi) vero C1008 reported the presence of 1000 and 100 TCID50 of ZIKV MR766 on all occasions at 14 days in vitro assay. the onset of CPE was observed as early as 3 days p.i. with the mean appearance of CPE on days 5 and 7 for 1000 and 100 TCID50. vero CCL-81 detected 1000, 100 and 10 TCID50 of ZIKV MR766 in all wells inoculated on each occasion. the mean appearance of CPE was reported on day 6 for 1000 TCID50 inoculum, on day 7 for 100 TCID50 and on day 8 for 10 and 1 TCID50. the mean appearance of CPE was reported on day 6 for 1000 TCID50 inoculum, on day 7 for 100 TCID TCID50 elicited clear detection on all occasions (n=18) within 6 days. monolayers of detector cells were incubated with 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID50 ZIKV MR766 and ZIKV PE243. data represent viral inoculations performed on 3 separate occasions. MRC-5 cells, vero C1008 and vero CCL-81 challenged with strains of ZIKV. on day 14, supernatants from cultures with less than 100 % of the wells showing CPE were inoculated onto fresh detector cells. 14 Day 28 Day 14 Day 28 Negative control n/a n/a n/a 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % ZIKV MR766 1000 690 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 10 6.9 61 % 100 % 67 % 1 TCID50 unit is equivalent to ln (2) infectious units. 1 TCID50 unit is equivalent to 0.69 infectious units. data represent viral inoculations performed on 3 separate occasions. monolayers of detector cells were incubated with 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID50 ZIKV PE243 and monitored for CPE over a period of 14 or 28 days. micrographs shown are representative of the observations made in detector cell lines. monolayers of detector cells were incubated with 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID50 ZIKV MR766 and ZIKV PE243. data represent viral inoculations performed on 3 separate occasions (runs 1\u20133). cell culture testing for adventitious viral contaminants on viral vaccines for human use is performed for a minimum of 14 days. veterinary vaccines are tested for the presence of adventitious viruses in an in vitro assay with a minimum of 28 days' culture. haemadsorption and haemagglutination end-point tests could serve as suitable and complementary to the CPE method of detecting ZIKV following 14- and 28-day in vitro culture. clear and unambiguous CPE offers a robust end point that does not rely on species-dependent erythrocyte selection. we therefore assessed the suitability of two cell lines to detect ZIKV of African and Asian lineage. CC CRL-1587 isolated from vero CCL-81 in 1968. vero C1008 cells exhibit a slower growth rate in comparison to. vero CCL-81 and vero C1008 cells both indicated the presence of ZIKV strains MR766 and PE243 in a similar manner. vero cell lines are deficient in the synthesis of interferon alpha and beta (IFN /) host immune defence molecules aimed at restricting viral replication. a wide range of arthropod-borne viruses including strains of dengue types 1\u20134, west Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Usutu [57, 58] and ZIKV [41] replicate and elicit CPE in vero cells. MRC-5 and vero cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbeco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (HG-DMEM, Gibco) with 10 % Foetal Clone III (Hyclone), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM non-essential amino acids. the characterization of MRC-5 and vero cells includes confirmation of cell line identity and the assessment of purity and freedom from bacteria. two strains of ZIKV were used for this study, representing the african and Asian lineages. the African strain, LC002520/MR766/1947/Uganda (abbreviated as MR766) was isolated from a patient from Recife, Brazil in 1947. MR766 was 8.88107 TCID50 ml1 (7.89 log10, SD=0.2 log10, n=4) and 4.80107 TCID50 ml1 (7.41 log10, SD=0.5 log10, n=4) for ZIKV PE243. bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI3, VR-281) and measles virus (VR-24, Edmonston strain) were obtained from ATCC. MRC-5 cells were inoculated with measles virus at 100 TCID50. vero cells (CCL-81 and C1008) were inoculated with parainfluenza virus type 3 at 100 TCID50. cultures were maintained for a minimum period of 14 days, examined regularly and fed at least once per week. MRC-5 and vero cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium (HG-DMEM, Gibco) both detector cell lines were maintained in HG-DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) for titration and subsequent in vitro adventitious virus assays. ZIKV MR766 and ZIKV PE243 were titrated on vero cells. each virus was titrated using 96-well titration with eight replicates. each virus was titrated with four replicates performed on two occasions. negative controls inoculated cultures with 1 ml/well of phosphate buffered saline. one 6-well plate per cell type was inoculated with a volume of 0.5 ml per well. the cultures were refed with 2 ml per well maintenance medium. the appearance of CPE was recorded and images were taken. data represent inoculations performed in 18 wells of detector cells seeded in 6-well plates. monolayers of cells in run 3 were maintained for 14 days."}
