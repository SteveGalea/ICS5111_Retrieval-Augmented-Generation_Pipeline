{"summary": "tenofovir vaginal gel applied daily provided no protection against HIV acquisition in the recently discontinued arm of the Microbicide Trials Network 003 (VOICE) trial. efficacies of 66% and 73% were observed among women taking daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or the combination of TDF and emtricitabine (Truvada) were discontinued early for futility (3\u20136) GRFT is a small homodimeric lectin that was isolated from a red alga (Griffithsia sp.) it binds to clusters of oligomannose N-linked glycans on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to prevent viral entry. it is unlikely that GRFT will be developed as part of any antiretroviral treatment regimen because of its poor oral bioavailability. a murine model evaluates whether formulated gels potentiate the susceptibility of mice to genital herpes. we hypothesize that increased susceptibility to genital herpes in the mouse reflects changes in mucosal integrity and immune environment. cellulose sulfate may disrupt the epithelial barrier to facilitate HIV and HSV infection. the glycans on the HSV-2 envelope glycoproteins were predominantly of the complex form (24). GRFT would have only modest activity against HSV-2, reflecting the presence of fewer oligomannose glycans on its envelope glycoproteins. TZM-bl cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin supplemented with 800 U/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 800 U/ml recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) was grown as previously described (26). HSV-2(G) (29) was grown on a matched placebo gel containing all excipients except GRFT was used as a negative control. nonoxynol-9 (N-9) was included as a positive toxicity control. 4% N-9 gel was obtained from Encare. cells were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing GRFT or medium alone. the cells were washed for 2 min with a low-pH citrate buffer. they were then washed three times with media before being overlaid with 199V alone or supplemented with GRFT. supernatants and cells were harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hpi. cells were washed with citrate buffer once and with medium three times. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit. drug was removed by washing thrice with serum-free medium before the addition of HIV-1BaL (40 ng of p24 antigen) in medium and JT-CCR5 cells to the apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) chambers. BL supernatants were collected at different times and tested for p24 content as previously described. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton, Dickinson LSR II analyzer. analysis was carried out using FlowJo version 9.3.1 software. ten thousand live events were acquired per sample. l of gel intravaginally 15 min prior to challenge with 30 l HSV-2-MS-luciferase diluted in PBS (equivalent to 106 PFU) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 1.6 mg d-luciferin potassium salt (gold biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) in 100 l PBS. total RNA was extracted from the genital tract using a Absolutely RNA reverse transcriptase PCR prep minikit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) Relative gene expression levels of cellular genes, normalized to -actin RNA levels as an endogenous housekeeping gene, were compared to those of untreated mice. compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or unpaired t tests. a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. TZM-bl cells (an engineered HeLa cell clone) were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. l penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin supplemented with 800 U/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 800 U/ml recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) was grown as previously described (26). HSV-2(4674), a clinical isolate obtained from the clinical virology laboratory at Montefiore Hospital, Bronx, GRFT was used as a negative toxicity control. nonoxynol-9 (N-9) was included as a positive toxicity control. 4% N-9 gel was obtained from Encare. ten thousand live events were acquired per sample. to determine if GRFT blocked release of infectious progeny from DCs. cells were cultured for 24 h in medium containing GRFT or medium alone. cells were washed for 2 min with a low-pH citrate buffer. supernatants and cells were harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hpi. cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with citrate buffer once and with medium three times. cells were exposed to 10, 100, or 500 g/ml of GRFT or medium as a negative-control overnight (moDCs) or for 48 h (CaSki, VK2/E6E7, and 3T3) at 37\u00b0C. cell viability was assessed using an annexin V and 7AAD staining protocol (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) female BALB/c mice were pretreated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate. mice were challenged with 30 l of virus diluted either in PBS or in pooled human seminal plasma (SP) images were captured using an IVIS Lumina II bioluminescent imager. 40 l of GRFT or Carbopol gel was delivered intravaginally daily for 7 days to MPA-treated mice. IL-6, gamma interferon (IFN-), IL-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1), MIP-2, RANTES, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) release. gene expression levels of cellular genes, normalized to -actin RNA levels as an endogenous housekeeping gene, were compared to those of untreated mice. RESULTS GRFT has modest effects on HSV entry but inhibits cell-to-cell spread. human cervical (CaSki) and vaginal (VK2/E6E7) cells or murine fibroblasts (3T3) were infected with HSV-2(4674) in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRFT (0, 10, 100, or 500 g/ml) or PRO 2000 (200 g/ml) CaSki, VK2/E6E7, and 3T3 cells were exposed to GRFT or PRO 2000 for 15 min, followed by challenge with HSV-2(4674) for 1 h. results are presented as percentages of control (no drug) and are means + SEM from 2 to 4 experiments conducted in duplicate. EC50 and EC90 (g/ml) were calculated for GRFT using data from panels A to C and Fig. 2A. titers of supernatants and cells were determined separately to exclude any effect of residual extracellular GRFT in supernatants. GRFT almost completely blocked multistep growth of virus. atants and cells were harvested and titers were determined on vero cells. asterisks indicate significance compared to no drug using two-way ANOVA. cells were harvested 8 or 12 hpi, and DNA was extracted and run in real-time PCR. d immunoglobulin neutralizes any released virus, restricting viral spread. GRFT inhibits cell-to-cell spread in the murine model. medroxyprogesterone-treated mice received a single dose of GRFT. the number of mice in each group is indicated in the figure legend of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. disease scores for the 20 mice treated with GRFT gel and challenged with an LD50 of HSV-2 in PBS are shown in panel C. luciferase activity increased by an average of 2.7-fold and 4.7-fold compared to the background. GRFT-treated mice showed no increase in luciferase activity compared to an uninfected mouse. strong IFN- responses are associated with viral clearance. individuals with recurrent disease have impaired virus-specific IFN- responses compared with those of asymptomatic HSV-2 carriers. controls included mice treated with GRFT or Carbopol gel. gene expression measured by qRT-PCR on genital tract tissue harvested from 2 to 10 mice on days 1 and 3 postinfection. RNA was isolated from genital tract tissue and analyzed by RT-qPCR on days 1 and 3 postinfection. GRFT itself had no impact on IFN responses compared to untreated mice. TER and p24 contents in BL culture supernatants were measured daily. the former provides a measure of barrier integrity and the latter of HIV transmigration across the epithelium. additional controls included inserts in which no cells were seeded. supernatants were collected from the basolateral chambers at the indicated times. results are means SD from at least two independent experiments. controls included wells in which no drug was added (medium), no cells were added, and no HIV was added. opol-treated mice succumbed to infection following exposure to an LD90. repeat exposure to griffithsin does not increase susceptibility to HSV-2. mice were pretreated with medroxyprogesterone acetate; 5 days later, mice received one 20-l dose of GRFT, Carbopol, or 4% N-9 gel intravaginally daily for 7 days. GRFT did not induce apoptosis in DCs compared to the mock-exposed cells. GRFT did not induce apoptosis in DCs compared to the mock-exposed cells. cells or murine fibroblasts (3T3) were infected with HSV-2(4674) in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRFT (0, 10, 100, or 500 g/ml) or PRO 2000 (200 g/ml), a known inhibitor of HSV binding and entry (31) for 1 h. GRFT had only modest effects on HSV plaque formation and reduced the number of plaques by less than 50% even at the highest concentration. the cells were exposed to GRFT overnight and then challenged with HSV-2(333)ZAG (MOI of 1 PFU/cell) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. results are presented as percentage of GFP+ cells and are means + SEM from 6 (pretreat) independent experiments. titers of supernatants and cells were determined separately to exclude any effect of extracellular GRFT in supernatants or intracellular ACV in the harvested cells. GRFT almost completely blocked multistep growth of virus. GRFT had little or no effect on the single-step growth curve. asterisks indicate significance compared to no drug (control) using two-way ANOVA. cells were harvested 8 or 12 hpi and DNA was extracted and run in real-time PCR. data are shown as means + SEM of percentage of virus control. GRFT prevents cell-to-cell spread in the murine model. medroxyprogesterone-treated mice received a single dose of 0.1% GRFT or no gel 15 min prior to challenge with an LD50 or LD90 of HSV-2. mice were monitored and scored for 14 days for signs of disease. disease scores for 20 mice treated with GRFT gel and challenged with an LD50 of HSV-2 in PBS are shown in panel C. asterisks denote that the difference in disease scores was significantly lower for GRFT- than for Carbopol-treated mice at each time point. luciferase activity increased by an average of 2.7-fold and 4.7-fold compared to the background. GRFT-treated mice showed no increase in luciferase activity compared to an uninfected mouse. none of the GRFT-treated mice developed significant clinical disease. controls included mice treated with GRFT or Carbopol gel that were not infected and untreated, uninfected mice. there was an increase in vaginal wash levels of IFN- and several proinflammatory mediators in HSV-2-infected compared to untreated mice. on the IFN response to virus, RNA was isolated from genital tract tissue. RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR on days 1 and 3 postinfection. GRFT itself had no impact on IFN responses compared to untreated mice. TER fell rapidly and HIV freely traversed the disrupted epithelium. exposure to both concentrations of GRFT resulted in a modest and less sustained decline in TER. only a small amount of HIV traverses the barrier when cells are cultured in medium. mice were treated once daily for 7 consecutive days with 0.1% GRFT gel, Carbopol gel, or 4% N-9 gel, and then 12 to 24 h after the last dose, vaginal washes were collected to remove any residual luminal drug. survival rates between GRFT- and Carbopol-treated mice did not differ significantly at any of the challenge doses. mice were pretreated with medroxyprogesterone acetate; 5 days later, mice received one 20-l dose of 0.1% GRFT, Carbopol, or 4% N-9 gel intravaginally daily for 7 days. on the eighth day, a vaginal wash was taken to remove residual drug and to test for residual anti-HIV activity in a TZM-bl assay. GRFT did not induce apoptosis in DCs compared to the mock-exposed cells. Griffithsin does not induce DC maturation or induce apoptosis. gE contributes to cell-to-cell spread in epithelial and neuronal cell models. gE contributes to cell-to-cell spread in epithelial and neuronal cell models. gE is not required for viral entry. GRFT targets glycans on the viral envelope glycoproteins and/or cellular receptors/coreceptors involved in cell-to-cell spread. gC-1 contains nine sites for N-linked glycosylation and numerous clusters of O-linked glycans. gC-1 mediates binding of HSV-1 to heparan sulfate and is involved in immune evasion through its interactions with complement components. GRFT induced a modest decrease in the TER and a concomitant increase in HIV migration across the epithelial barrier to infect T cells cultured in the lower chamber. this contrasts with previous studies with N-9, which triggered a rapid and profound drop in TER and increased the susceptibility of the mice to HSV-2 following intravaginal challenge with either an LD10 or LD50. prevalence and public health impact of genital herpes continues to increase. prevalence of genital herpes is 90 to 95% among HIV-infected individuals and female sex workers in developing countries. GRFT is a strong candidate for further advancement, either alone or in combination with other anti-HSV products. drugs, as topical PrEP."}
