OD600 = 1 in synthetic media containing 2% raffinose. one half was treated immediately ( galactose) and the other half was returned to 30\u00b0C for 90 min. 0.5 OD units were analyzed for CPY secretion. delivery of proteins containing the luminal domain of ALP to the vacuole can be monitored by detecting a vacuolar protease-dependent (PEP4-dependent) cleavage. RS-ALP is localized to the TGN and does not undergo any significant processing. LP from wild-type and pep4-3 cells harboring pSN55 (A-ALP) or pSN97 (RS-ALP) and SNY63 (pep4-3) cells harboring pSN97 (RS-ALP) were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min. at indicated times, the cells were spheroplasted and extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP. Vph1p and 80\u201390% of the total cellular Pep12p, Kex2p, and RS-ALP were resuspended and loaded on a 20\u201350% sucrose gradient. the residual vacuolar membranes, defined by Vph1p, and prevacuolar membranes, defined by Pep12p (Becherer et al., 1996; Piper, R.C., and T.H. Stevens, unpublished results anti-Vph1p mAb 10D7-A7-B2 was used to detect Vph1p as a marker protein for vacuolar membranes. pep12p, a marker protein for membranes of the prevacuolar compartment, was detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. vps27 mutant cells accumulate an exaggerated form of the PVC. CPY was suppressed in vps27 mutant cells now producing Vps27p. the CPY sorting receptor (Vps10p) had regained the ability to cycle between the PVC and the TGN. whole-cell extracts were prepared from 10 OD units of NBY67 cells harboring pSN97 and pHY5 or empty vector to detect the presence of Vps27p. 0.5 OD units of cells were radiolabeled to determine whether the cells were secreting CPY. all three proteins localized to the exaggerated PVC in vps27 mutant cells. p redistribution of A-ALP, (F/A)A-ALP, and RS-ALP upon induction of synthesis of Vps27p in vps27 cells. NBY67 (vps27) cells harboring either pSN55 (A-ALP), pSN100 ((F/A)A-ALP) or pSN97 (RS-ALP) and pHY5 (VPS27 under GAL1 control) DPAP A slows its exit from the TGN. the cytosolic tail of DPAP A contains a second signal, not present in RS-ALP, that slows its exit from the TGN. the assay is based on measuring the rate of proteolytic processing of membrane proteins in vps27 mutant cells. RS-ALP was proteolytically processed with half-times of 90 min in wild-type cells and 15 min in vps27 cells. this suggests that RS-ALP exits rapidly from the TGN. DPAP A cytosolic domain indeed slows exit from the TGN. IIF WT vps27 min A-ALP >180 70 Golgi (F/A)-ALP 60 60 Vacuolar RS-ALP 90 15 Golgi (2-41)A-ALP 85 15 Golgi (2-41)A-ALP 95 20 Golgi (2-41)A-ALP 100 25 Golgi (2-21)A-ALP 85 15 Golgi (68-106)A-ALP 90 15 Golgi (68 indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) used affiniity-purified polyclonal antibodies specific for ALP. we compared the rates of proteolytic processing of the CPY sorting receptor, Vps10p, in wild-type and vps27 mutant cells. we also determined processing rates for the recycling-defective form of Vps10p. vps27-ts cells exhibited staining patterns typical of Golgi membrane proteins. RS-ALP, RS-ALP, and Vps10p redistributed to the exaggerated PVC. exit from the TGN is rate-limiting step for A-ALP processing. polyclonal antibodies in combination with biotin-linked secondary antibody and streptavidin-conjugated FITC. differences in the rate of exit from the TGN could arise through information contained within the tails of A-ALP and Vps10p. a series of deletions was made in the 118\u2013amino acid cytosolic tail of Ste13p in the context of A-ALP. both wild-type and vps27 mutant cells harboring either pNB81 ((2-11)AALP) or pSN27 ((68-106)A-ALP) were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min. the cells were spheroplasted, and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP. the DPAP A TGN retention signal can be mutationally separated into two components, an NH2-terminal signal for slowing exit from the TGN, and the FXFXD motif. the cytosolic domain of DPAP A is necessary and sufficient to retain the transmembrane and luminal domains of the vacuolar protein ALP in the last definable Golgi subcompartment in yeast. A-ALP is localized to the TGN and does not undergo any significant processing. RS-ALP undergoes PEP4-dependent proteolytic cleavage with a half-time of 90 min in wild-type cells. pSN97 (RS-ALP) were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min and chased by adding unlabeled methionine and cysteine each to a final concentration of 50 g/ml. at the indicated times, the cells were spheroplasted and extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP. RS-ALP has reached a post-Golgi compartment containing activated vacuolar proteases, and has been retrieved back to the TGN. RS-ALP has reached a post-Golgi compartment containing activated vacuolar proteases, and has been retrieved back to the TGN. vps27 mutant cells accumulate exaggerated form of the PVC. vps27 mutant cells carrying the GAL1VPS27 plasmid produced Vps27p only after the addition of galactose. CPY sorting receptor (Vps10p) had regained the ability to cycle between vps10p and vps10p. TGN membrane proteins such as Vps10p, A-ALP, and RS-ALP continuously leave Golgi membranes and enter the PVC. this retrieval requires Vps27p, and in vps27 cells, TGN membrane proteins accumulate in an exaggerated form of the PVC, the class E compartment. the rate at which proteolytically sensitive proteins are processed can be used to measure the rate at which they enter this compartment. NBY67 cells harboring pSN97 and pHY5 or empty vector to detect the presence of Vps27p. we performed indirect immunofluorescence to determine the fate of A-ALP, RS-ALP, and the retrieval-defective form of A-ALP, (F/A)A-ALP in vps27 mutant cells after restoration of Vps27p function. NBY67 (vps27) cells harboring either pSN55 (A-ALP), pSN100 ((F/A)A-ALP) or pSN97 (RS-ALP) were grown in synthetic media containing 2% raffinose. at times (A) t = 0 ( galactose) and (B) t = 90 min (+ galactose) were allowed to grow for an additional 90 min. RS-ALP localize to the TGN, only RS-ALP undergoes measurable proteolytic processing in wild-type yeast cells. the cytosolic tail of DPAP A contains a second signal, not present in RS-ALP, that slows its exit from the TGN. the assay is based on measuring the rate of proteolytic processing of TGN proteins in vps27 mutant cells. min in wild-type cells and 15 min in vps27 cells. this suggests that RS-ALP exits rapidly from the TGN. a slow rate of TGN exit would be consistent with the function of DPAP A. half-time of processing Localization by IIF WT vps27 min A-ALP >180 70 Golgi (F/A)-ALP 60 60 Vacuolar RS-ALP 90 15 Golgi (2-51)A-ALP 85 15 Golgi (2-41)A-ALP 95 20 Golgi (2-31)A-ALP 100 25 Golgi (2-21)A-ALP 90 15 Golgi (68-106)A-ALP Vps10p was cleaved by vacuolar proteases with a half-time of 20 min in vps27 mutant cells. rapid exit from the TGN is consistent with its function as the CPY sorting receptor, binding proCPY in the TGN. vps27-ts cells exhibited staining patterns typical of Golgi membrane proteins. RS-ALP, RS-ALP, and Vps10p redistributed to the exaggerated PVC. exit from the TGN is the rate-limiting step for A-ALP processing. a series of deletions was made in the 118\u2013amino acid cytosolic tail of Ste13p in the context of A-ALP. the proteolytic processing rates of a number of mutated A-ALP fusion proteins were determined in both wild-type and vps27 mutant cells. the signal to slow exit from the TGN resides in the first 50 amino acids of the DPAP. vps27 cells harboring either pNB81 ((2-11)AALP) or pSN27 ((68-106)A-ALP) were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min. at indicated times, the cells were spheroplasted, and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. the yeast S. cerevisiae uses two different modes of retention to ensure localization of DPAP A to the yeast TGN. the first is the well-characterized motif containing aromatic amino acid residues (FXFXD in DPAP A) which functions in retrieval from the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) back to the TGN. DPAP A was exposed to active vacuolar proteases in a post-Golgi compartment. this motif is required to specify redistribution of A-ALP from the class E compartment (exaggerated PVC) to golgi membranes. vps27 mutant cells are blocked in traffic from the PVC back to the TGN. mutations in the FXFXD retrieval motif in the cytosolic domain of DPAP A were found to result in vacuolar delivery of the A-ALP fusion protein with a half-time of 60 min. vps27 mutant cells were used to estimate whether the various A-ALP fusion proteins were all delivered to the PVC at the same rate. the slow rate of transport of A-ALP to the PVC reflects a slow rate of exit from the TGN. DPAP A contains both retrieval and static retention signals. DPAP A is involved in the processing of the mating pheromone -factor precursor. DPAP A NH2 Terminus Specifies Static Golgi Retention Deletion of the first 50 amino acids of the DPAP A cytosolic domain did not affect the localization of the resulting (2-51)A-ALP fusion protein. however, deletion of residues 68\u2013106 of the DPAP A cytosolic domain produced a retention-defective form of A-ALP, (68-106)AALP (localized to the vacuole the presence of the static retention signal in the cytosolic domain of DPAP A helps explain why both A-ALP and RS-ALP are localized to the TGN. but only RS-ALP gets proteolytically processed by vacuolar proteases in a postGolgi compartment. this compartment contains low levels of activated vacuolar proteases en route to the vacuole. DPAP A requires both static retention and retrieval for efficient localization to the yeast TGN. we propose that the NH2 terminus of DPAP A serves to keep this protein anchored in the TGN membrane, and that this protein only occasionally exits the Golgi apparatus (half-time of 60 min) vps27 mutant cells are blocked in traffic from the PVC back to the Golgi apparatus. vps27 mutant cells are blocked in traffic from the PVC back to the Golgi apparatus. this assay successfully uncouples retrieval-mediated localization from static retention\u2013based Golgi localization. there are two signals for TGN Localization of DPAP A Consistent with earlier work. mutations in the FXFXD retrieval motif in the cytosolic domain of DPAP A resulted in vacuolar delivery of the A-ALP fusion protein with a half-time of 60 min. the slow rate of transport of A-ALP to the PVC reflects a slow rate of exit from the TGN. as with A-ALP, the rate of delivery to the PVC was independent of the presence or absence of the aromatic amino acid\u2013based retrieval motif located elsewhere. overexpression of Vps10p leads to processing of A-ALP in wild-type cells. the rate of processing of A-ALP in vps27 cells is unaffected by overexpression of Vps10p. DPAP A NH2 Terminus Specifies Static Golgi Retention Deletion of the first 50 amino acids of the DPAP A cytosolic domain did not affect the localization of the resulting (2-51)A-ALP fusion the smallest deletion, removing only residues 2\u201311 of the DPAP A cytosolic domain, still eliminated the static mode of retention. the first 11 amino acid residues of DPAP A are required for static retention. the presence of the static retention signal in the cytosolic domain of DPAP A helps explain why both A-ALP and RS-ALP are localized to the TGN. if RS-ALP is being retrieved from the same PVC as Vps10p, then the differential rate of proteolysis may reflect a differential susceptibility to the low levels of proteases in the PVC. DPAP A requires both static retention and retrieval for efficient localization to the yeast TGN."}
