{"summary": "PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Deltacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (4). PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus deltacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (4). coronavirus accessory proteins have been widely considered dispensable for viral replication in vitro. many accessory proteins are involved in immune regulation, such as SARS-CoV ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF9b (26\u201328), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) ns2 (32, 33) accessory protein NS6 is encoded between the M and N genes in the PDCoV genome. it is expressed in virus-infected cytoplasm and has been detected in purified virions. PDCoV NS6 inhibits seV-induced IFN- production. ed by NS6 overexpression in both cell lines, we performed IFN bioassays using an IFN-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) the level of VSV-GFP replication is inversely linked to the levels of secreted IFN-/ from the transfected HEK-293T cells. at 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or infected with SeV. expression of PDCoV NS6 protein was confirmed by Western blotting. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of pCAGGS-HA-NS6 or empty vector. HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6 and the luciferase reporter plasmid IRF3-Luc or NF-B-Luc. each contains four copies of the IRF- or NF-B-binding motif of the IFN- promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6 or empty vector after 24 h. the cells were then fixed and subjected to an immunofluorescence assay. the cells were then stained with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (green) the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 and p65 were markedly enhanced in seV-infected cells compared with those in mock-infected cells. however, the seV-mediated IRF3 and p65 phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in NS6-expressing cells. PDCoV NS6 fails to disrupt IFN- promoter activation driven by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IKK, or IRF3. NS6 fails to inhibit IFN- production induced by RLR signaling pathway molecules. HEK-293T cells were transfected with IFN-\u2013Luc, pRL-TK, and pCAGGS-HA-NS6 along with constructs expressing RIG-I/RIG-IN (A), MDA5 (B), MAVS (C), TBK1 and IRF3 (E) NS6 disrupts the IFN- promoter activation induced by RIG-I or MDA5 coupled with SeV or poly(IC) at 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with SeV/poly(IC) or were left untreated for 12 h. dual-Luciferase reporter assays were then performed as described in Fig. 4. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged NS6 protein and Flag-tagged RIG-I or MDA5. NS6 proteins were also efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with HA-NS6 by anti-HA MAb. whole-cell lysates (WCL) and immunoprecipitation complexes were analyzed via Western blotting using anti-flag, anti-HA, or anti-actin antibodies. at 28 h after transfection, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence assays to detect NS6 protein (red) and RIG-I or MDA5 (green) with anti-HA and anti-flag antibodies. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with NS6 and plasmids for 24 h. plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used as a control. lysates from transfected cells were treated with RNase A (50 g/ml; TaKaRa) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA. NS6 coimmunoprecipitated with the CTD of RIG-I, or the Hel and CTD of MDA5 but not with other mutants of RIG-I/MDA5. in reverse Co-IP experiments with anti-HA MAb, both RIG-I CTD and MDA5 Hel and CTD were able to coimmunoprecipitate with NS6. PDCoV N protein was found bound for poly(IC)-coated agarose beads and poly(C)-coated agarose beads. NS6 protein was not detected bound to either poly(IC)-coated agarose beads or poly(C)-coated agarose beads, verifying that NS6 is not an RNA binding protein. NS6 attenuates the interaction of dsRNA with RIG-I/MDA5. NS6 protein disrupts or attenuates binding of dsRNA with RIG-I/MDA5. NS6 protein at least partially functions to block dsRNA. hek-293T cells were individually transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-tagged RIG-I (A), MDA5 (B) and increasing quantities of NS6 expression plasmids for 28 h. lysates from the cells overexpressing NS6 were incubated with an equal volume of lysates from cells overexpressing NS6. the beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer by centrifugation. human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells or porcine kidney (LLC-PK1) cells were cotransfected for 24 h with increasing amounts of NS6 expression plasmid (pCAGGS-HA-NS6) or empty vector. the cells were lysed, and the resultant lysates were subjected to dual-Luciferase reporter assays. pCAGGS-HA\u2013NS6-transfected HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of pCAGGS-HA-NS6 or empty vector. the expression of PDCoV NS6 protein was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. at 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or infected with SeV. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6. at 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6. the total RNA was then extracted, and the seV HN gene expression level was analyzed. HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6 or empty vector. after 24 h, the cells were infected with SeV or left untreated for 8 h. the cells were then fixed and subjected to an immunofluorescence assay. fluorescent images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope. DAPI staining indicates the locations of the cell nuclei. PDCoV NS6 acts as an IFN antagonistic protein by blocking the activation of IRF3 and p65. NS6 protein inhibits the SeV-mediated activation of IRF3 and p65. we measured the effect of NS6 on the IFN- production induced by a series of key signaling molecules in the RLR signaling pathway. NS6 failed to block the activation of the IFN- promoter in cells overexpressing any of the above-described signaling molecules. NS6 protein blocks the IFN- promoter activation induced by the combination of RIG-I/MDA5 and SeV/poly(IC) the ectopic expression of NS6 significantly inhibits SeV-mediated IFN- production. NS6 disrupts the IFN- promoter activation induced by RIG-I or MDA5 coupled with SeV or poly(IC) HEK-293T cells were transfected with IFN-\u2013Luc, pRL-TK, and the other indicated expression plasmids. at 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with SeV/poly(IC) or were left untreated for 12 h. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6 and Flag-tagged RIG-I (A and C) or Flag-tagged MDA5 (B and D), respectively. at 28 h after transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-HA or anti-flag antibody. tagged RIG-I (G), or MDA5 (H) expression plasmids for 24 h followed by transfection with poly(IC) cell lysates and immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays. previous studies have identified RIG-I and MDA5 as dsRNA-binding proteins (29, 52) both RIG-I and MDA5 are RIG-I-like receptors. NS6 interacts with the carboxyl terminus domain of RIG-I or the helicase and carboxyl terminus domains of MDA5. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-NS6. expression plasmids encoding the 2CARD, Hel, or CTD of RIG-I/MDA5. NS6 protein is not a dsRNA-binding protein. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding flag-tagged RIG-I protein, PDCoV NS6 and N protein, or empty vector, respectively. the supernatants were incubated with poly(C)- or poly(IC)-coated agarose beads for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. NS6 attenuates the interaction of dsRNA with RIG-I/MDA5. lysates from cells transfected with RIG-I or MDA5 expression constructs were incubated with those from cells transfected with increasing concentrations of NS6 expression plasmid. bound RIG-I, MDA5, and NS6 proteins were clearly detected in whole-cell lysates. however, significantly smaller amounts of RIG-I and MDA5 coimmunoprecipitated with poly(IC)-coated agarose beads were detected with RIG-I acts as a representative protein, of the mechanism for NS6 protein inhibition of the RLR signaling pathway. the CTD is tethered to the red bridging helix by a flexible linker. Upon virus infection, the CTD-bound dsRNA is preoriented to form a network of interactions with the helicase domains Hel-1 and Hel-2i but not Hel-2. many viral proteins target these two molecules to disrupt IFN signaling. for example, both human respiratory syncytial virus NS2 protein and New World arenavirus Z protein antagonize the activation of IFN- production via interacting with RIG-I to disturb its association with the downstream signaling molecule MAVS. also, influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with RIG-I and inhibits RIG-I ubiquitination to antagonize RIG- RNA helicase containing two RecA domains (Hel-1 and Hel-2) with a family-specific insertion, named Hel-2i, within Hel-2, and a CTD (53, 64, 65) the different interaction domain between RIG-I and MDA5 with NS6 is reasonable and can be explained. the interaction between NS6 and the CTD of RIG-I or the Hel and CTD of MDA5 appears to block the dsRNA binding sites (CTDs or Hel), resulting in RIG-I/MDA5 having a reduced dsRNA-binding ability. the possibility that NS6 inhibits SeV/poly(IC)-induced IFN- production by competing with dsRNA for binding to RIG-I/MDA5 can be excluded a PDCoV reverse genetics system was not available when this work was conducted, preventing further investigation of the NS6 IFN antagonist activity at the level of virus infection in vivo. PDCoV NS6 appears to interact preferentially with RNA-binding proteins, even though it is not an RNA-binding protein itself. this study found that PDCoV NS6 appears to interact preferentially with RNA-binding proteins. PDCoV nsp5 (70, 71) and NS6 protein (this study) have been identified as IFN antagonists. at least eight proteins encoded by SARS-CoV have been identified as IFN antagonists. further identification and characterization of PDCoV-encoded IFN antagonists will accelerate the elucidation of the association between PDCoV and the IFN signaling pathway. pCAGGS-HA-NS6 and pCAGGS-Flag-NS6 cloned into pCAGGS-Flag-N vector. plasmid named pCAGGS-Flag-N using primers PDCoV-N-F and PDCoV-N-R. expression plasmids for flag-tagged RIG-I and its constitutively activated mutant, RIG-IN, have been described previously. luciferase cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-Luc, NF-B-Luc, or IRF3-Luc) and pRL-TK (Promega) at 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with SeV (10 hemagglutinating activity units/well) HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of NS6 protein. after 24 h, the cells were mock infected or infected with SeV for 12 h. total RNA was extracted from the treated cells with TRIzol. each quantitative real-time PCR experiment was performed at least three times. the results are expressed as the relative gene expression level with normalization to the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Beyotime, China) for 45 min at room temperature. expression levels of -actin were detected with a mouse anti--actin monoclonal antibody (MBL) after 28 h, the cells were harvested and lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer.
