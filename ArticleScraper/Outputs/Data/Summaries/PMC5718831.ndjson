{"summary": "the 2015\u201316 outbreak of Ebola virus in west africa with its high death toll illustrates this point. the need for a fund for development of vaccines against emerging pathogens became obvious to many observers. by the end of 2015, several groups proposed the creation of a fund for development of vaccines against emerging pathogens. the public demands that a product used in healthy people to avoid possible infection be free of serious side effects and also highly effective. manufacturers face uncertainty as to whether a vaccine will be recommended and used once developed. the partial remedy for this type of situation may be Advanced Marketing Commitments. the WHO and other organizations have made lists of pathogens for which vaccine development is a priority, but there has been no mechanism for acting on those priorities. the likely recipients of a vaccine against those pathogens will be in Asia and Africa, whereas the markets that enable an acceptable return on investment are largely in North America and Europe. the high cost of vaccine development alluded to above means that the vaccine industry is constricted. a consensus of the most important is that the commercial market is insufficient to justify private investment in vaccine development against an emerging pathogen. inherent in this concept is that applicants must have a means of producing the candidate under Good Manufacturing Practice. in situations where a phase III trial is feasible owing to continued incidence of infection it would be done. a list put together by the foundation for Vaccine Research was long and it is clearly not possible to attack all listed. another list put together by a WHO group was more restricted, but had the disadvantages of excluding bacteria and pathogens for which vaccine candidates do not exist. they focus on infections that are or have been epidemic, excluding those that are not yet prevented by vaccination. despite the disruption caused by the SARS outbreak it was insufficient to generate new mechanisms, to say nothing of MERS and Zika. multiple governments and philanthropic organizations have contributed at least 800 million dollars to launch CEPI. RNA vaccines of different types are less advanced but commercial development is moving rapidly and ultimately they may offer advantages. many of these approaches were used to develop candidate vaccines to prevent Ebola Zaire strain infections. Efficacy in humans could be demonstrated with the VSV vector before the west africa epidemic subsided. the success of the VSV vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine in human trials implies that vaccines can be made against the other related filoviruses. unless fortuitous outbreaks occur we will be unable to demonstrate the efficacy of those other filovirus vaccines except by determination of correlates of protection in 2 relevant animal models. the mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus suggests itself as an easier target, with multiple candidates in far advanced development. the virus is a virus with a genome that synthesizes envelope proteins against which antibodies are typically effective. however, there is only one serotype. at least 4 vaccines have been tested in humans, and 17 others have shown promise in animals. the most advanced are a virus-like particle vaccine using the envelope proteins. the most advanced are a virus-like particle vaccine using the envelope proteins. migrating from new york to virtually the entire country through mosquito-borne infection of birds. the reservoir has diminished due to death of many infected birds and post-infection immunity in others. there were still over 2,000 cases in the us in 2015. ence of the west-African virus from the central African virus occurred about 2004. the closest virus sequence to that found in the west africa epidemic from a human case was that from the 2007 epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 y before the human epidemic in Guinea started in 2014. Table 7 shows 5 stages of adaptation to humans proposed by Wolfe et al. traits that make certain viruses more likely to cause disease in humans. one factor that increases the likelihood of epidemic spread is the height and duration of virus replication in humans. the ability of a virus to spread may depend on a change in route of transmission. the ability of a virus to spread may depend on a change in route of transmission. a list of viruses known or suspected of being transmissible between humans has been proposed. encephalitis,* Usutu,* West Nile* Coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome Togaviruses Bamah Forest, o'nyong-nyong, Ross River, Semliki Forest, semliki forest, o'nyong-nyong, o'nyong-nyong, o'nyong-nyong, equine encephalitis Single-stranded RNA (negative sense idia protozoa are a common cause of infantile diarrhea, second only to rotavirus. if the mission of CEPI is to create vaccines for diseases that do not interest industry because those vaccines are not likely to be profitable, then that mission should be extended into the long-term future."}
