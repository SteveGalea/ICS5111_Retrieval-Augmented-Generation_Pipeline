{"summary": "autophagy is a homeostatic process wherein cytoplasmic material is sequestered in double membrane vesicles and degraded. the process is initiated when a cell perceives a signal such as starvation or pathogen infection. many of the required components are known [4]. autophagosome fuses with lysosome to form a degradative compartment, the autolysosome. process of autophagy is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. autophagy can act as an anti-viral component of the innate immune system. dengue virus is a positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. it is transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. infection with DENV can lead to a spectrum of clinical diseases. the non-structural proteins replicate the viral RNA and the structural proteins assemble with the nascent viral RNA to generate new virions. the virus manipulates many different cellular pathways, including autophagy. the authors hypothesized that DENV might replicate on amphisomes. inhibiting lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes increased viral replication. this indicated a role for mature autolysosomes in DENV3 infection. the mechanism for how autolysosomes could contribute to viral replication remains unclear. deNV induces and requires autophagy for robust viral replication. a type of selective autophagy called lipophagy was described. a type of selective autophagy called lipophagy was described. the defect in viral replication caused by inhibition of autophagy could be completely complemented by exogenous free fatty acids. this complementation of defective autophagy by free fatty acids required -oxidation. despite the many roles of autophagy in regulating cellular homeostasis, its regulation of lipid metabolism is a major contributor for robust DENV replication. RNA-induced innate immune response suggests that autophagy may promote DENV replication through repressing innate immunity. more work is required to show whether the proposed viral triggers of autophagy reproduce all cellular signals and phenotypes. a generic interference with autophagy is a dubious antiviral approach given the importance of autophagy to cellular survival. a generic interference with autophagy is a dubious antiviral approach given the importance of autophagy to cellular survival. there have been many proposals for the role of autophagy during DENV infection. future work will help to further characterize the role(s) and relative contributions of autophagy to the various aspects of DENV replication."}
