{"summary": "qRT-PCR data from virus and mock infected cells found that 18S rRNA was the most stable gene in HBECs, PTECs and avian lung cells. no detailed study has been described that compares the suitability of commonly used housekeeping genes in influenza virus infections. gene for normalising qRT-PCR data was highly affected by influenza virus infection. expression levels of other housekeeping genes were highly affected by influenza virus infection. qRT-PCR is widely used to quantify changes in messenger RNA levels. expression of many genes including ACTB are significantly altered in human cell lines following infection with cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6, camelpox virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and yellow fever virus. no detailed study has been carried out to demonstrate suitability of reference genes in different cells infected with a range of different viruses. bestkeeper analysis of housekeeping genes showing variation in gene expression was carried out using bestKeeper software. rRNA was the most stable among all the genes tested in HBECs, PTECs, and chicken and duck lung cells 24h following infection with various influenza virus subtypes. chicken lung cells H5N1 tyEng91 0.160 0.510 0.480 - H5N1 tyTR05 0.140 0.230 0.260 - Avian H2N3 0.200 0.230 0.200 - Average 0.167 0.323 0.313 - Duck lung cells H5N1 tyEng91 0.380 0.480 0.690 - H5N1 tyTR05 0.160 0.660 1.290 - Avian H2N3 0.110 0.190 0. NormFinder software calculates a stability number from intra- and inter-group variations. the stability numbers represent a measure of the systematic error introduced by each of the reference genes when used to normalise the qRT-PCR data. NormFinder analysis of reference genes in HBECs, pig (b), chicken (c) and duck (Figure 1d) lung cells also indicated that 18S rRNA was the best among the housekeeping genes comparison. expression of 18S rRNA was least affected by the infection of influenza A virus subtypes in all the cell types used in this study. several studies have also recommended ribosomal RNA as the best choice as a reference gene compared with other genes in a variety of cell culture systems [24-27]. a technical limitation of using 18S rRNA as a normaliser is that random primers must be used for cDNA synthesis rather than oligo-(dT) since r the 18S rRNA gene was the most stable gene in resting and polyclonal T cell activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. previous studies found that the18S rRNA gene was the most stable gene in resting and polyclonal T cell activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), [10], and hepatic cells in chicken [36,37] and geese [38]. in some tumour cells, multiple copies of particular loci in replicating bacteria compared to non replicating bacteria are some of the additional problems of normalising against genomic DNA. using multiple reference genes rather than one has also been suggested as a robust method for providing accurate normalisation. tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) were isolated from stripped tracheo-bronchial mucosae from 3- to 4-month-old euthanized pigs. both HBEC and PTECs were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM, CC-3170, Lonza UK) chicken and duck cells H5N1 tyEng91, H5N1 tyTR05 and avian H2N3 were rinsed three times with PBS. after 2h, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated in fresh medium until harvest at 24h post-infection (PI) Virus infection of cells was confirmed by immuno-chemical staining using a murine monoclonal antibody to influenza nucleoprotein (Abcam) with a DA the same primers were used for both chicken and duck samples. ACTB- TGCTGCGCTCGTTGTTGA (Fwd), TCGTCCCCGGCGAAA (Rev), GAPDH -GAAGCTTACTGGAATGGCTTTCC (Fwd), and 18S rRNA- TGTGCTTTTT (rev) PCR efficiencies were calculated using the formula Efficiency = 1+10(1/slope) all the genes tested ranged between 90-100%. determination of expression stability of reference genes BestKeeper and NormFinder software programmes. a gene with a low stability number is less likely to introduce systematic error that a gene with a high stability number. a gene with a low stability number is less likely to introduce systematic error that a gene with a high stability number. all the viruses were grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs by allantoic inoculation. both HBEC and PTECs were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium. primary lung cell cultures were extracted from lungs of euthanized 4-week-old broiler chickens and 6-week-old Pekin ducks. cDNA synthesis A two step qRT-PCR assay was used in which a first strand cDNA was synthesized with10g of the total RNA sample using random primers. ATP5B and ATP5G1 were also included for human and pig analysis. commercially available primers obtained from Primer Design Ltd (UK) were used for human and pig genes. RNA- TGTGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATT (Fwd), TGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTTT (Rev) all the reactions were carried out using the LightCycler\u00ae 480 (Roche) a master mix was prepared for each target gene comprising 10l of SYBR Green master mix, 0.8l each of forward and reverse primers (900nM) and 3.6 l of nuclease free water. bestKeeper software was used to calculate standard deviation (SD) (Cp) based on the raw Cp values from each of the virus infected and control samples (n=6) for all of the reference genes. the software then undertakes pair-wise correlation- regression analysis, to determine the relationship between each gene. MT, GAW and RKN carried out qRT-PCR assays. BB and SS performed human and pig cell infections, RNA extractions and cDNA synthesis. SPD, MJS and SMB conducted the H5N1 infection studies in high containment facilities."}
