{"summary": "studies of infectious disease transmission are often based on simulations. a forward projecting approach is problematic because of the many different outcomes. transmission depends not only on who is connected to whom, but also on when (in which order) these contacts occurred. defining a transmission matrix of the probabilities that transmission occurred between any pair of cases in the affected population. we will show how to formulate a likelihood function, allowing estimation of the elements of this matrix. the likelihood contains a pairwise kernel function dependent on the available data mentioned above (time, location,...) the probability that subject i obtained its infection from subject j is independent of the probability that subject k obtained its infection from subject j. a transmission link for subject i may be thought of as a random sample from a categorical distribution with probability vector vi. this is a vector with vi,k = 1 at the position (k) of the largest element of i and 0 elsewhere. if all elements in i are close to 0 and only i,k 1 this is sensible. but we would be less certain of who was the ancestor of case i. transmission probability matrix V can be defined 2.1 with element vi,j the probability subject i acquired its infection from subject j and vi the vector of transmission probabilities linking case i to any other case. rows must add to 1 2.3 any subject must have acquired their infection from exactly one other subject in the observed infected population. if i,j() is a parametric function, it may depend on parameters. the contribution of the pair (i,j) to the likelihood then is 2.4. if subject i is known not to have had contact with subject j the probability of transmission between them is vi,j = 0.. the likelihood function (equation) is then used to calculate the likelihood of that initial position in the Markov chain. the matrix of i,j(Xi,j|) then may have elements consisting of parametric probability densities with some common set of parameters. serial interval In previous studies, the likelihood of a transmission link between two cases has been calculated by way of the serial interval distribution [12]. when recorded times are interval censored, for example in days, the kernel function must be slightly modified. the serial interval between successive cases in a transmission chain: the generation interval Tg(i,j); the serial interval for onset of infectiousness Tinf(i,j) and the serial interval for symptom onset Tsymp(i,j). when the observed symptom onsets T1, T2,...,Tn are an ordered list of increasing times, the likelihood matrix is only non-zero in a region below and close to the diagonal depending on the maximum length of the serial interval. genetic similarity between pathogens from a pair of cases i and j can be expressed as a genetic kernel coefficient Gi,j weighting links between observed cases. Suppose a limited number of different genotypes of a pathogen may be found, that are sufficiently different so that one type cannot transform into another in a few generations, within an outbreak. a cluster of cases with mixed genotypes must consist of a mixture of transmission networks, one for each genotype. different possible genotypes produce different optimum (maximum likelihood) estimates of its links to other cases. assigning a different genotype to a case where that information is missing is equivalent to assigning that case to a different transmission sub-network. for most diseases this is not likely and for convenience it is assumed that any element with Tj > Ti must have a kernel likelihood zero. if the serial interval between successive cases exceeds the maximum serial interval, a link is highly unlikely and the corresponding kernel likelihood may also be set to zero. genetic similarity between pathogens from a pair of cases i and j can be expressed as a genetic kernel coefficient Gi,j weighting links between observed cases [21]. Suppose a limited number of different genotypes of a pathogen may be found, that are sufficiently different so that one type cannot transform into another in a few generations, within an outbreak. genotype k and sum of all pk add up to 1 assuming equal detectability of genotypes. for any single case, this is a sample from a categorical distribution. assigning a different genotype to a case where that information is missing is equivalent to assigning that case to a different transmission subnetwork. the sum 4.1 can be interpreted as the expectation of the number of cases produced by infectious case j, or its reproduction number. the posterior sample of transmission probability matrices can be considered a sample from the joint posterior distribution of transmission probabilities for all cases. a crude measure might be the number of non-zero elements in row i of the transmission matrix. it is not likely that all of these possible candidates were assigned the same probability of having infected subject i. the probability that i was infected by another infectious subject j and not by anyone else is vi,j. the sum 4.1 can be interpreted as the expectation of the number of cases produced by infectious case j, or its reproduction number. the posterior sample of transmission probability matrices can be considered a sample from the joint posterior distribution of transmission probabilities for all cases. a crude measure might be the number of non-zero elements in row i of the transmission matrix. it is not likely that all of these possible candidates were assigned the same probability of having infected subject i. the probability that i was infected by another infectious subject j is vi,j. in outbreaks with person-to-person transmission, such a cluster must be considered a mixture of as many outbreaks as there are identified genotypes. this analysis uses previously published data from norovirus outbreaks that occurred during a 5 year period (19 December 2002\u201331 December 2007) in a university hospital in the Netherlands. environmental transmission causes a tail effect with a low frequency of long serial intervals. a distribution for the serial interval was determined as a mixture of the distribution obtained from day-care centre data [13,28] and a component with similar shape (gamma distribution) but longer intervals, representing possible environmental transmission. cases with'missing' genotypes were included in the transmission analysis. a likely genotype could be inferred. for about 18 per cent of all cases a unique parent node could be identified. for 24 per cent of cases parent nodes could not be identified. for another 12 per cent of cases, a parent node could be found with minor uncertainty. figures 5a shows how nodes with a greater possible number of parents tend to have lower scores. the identification of parent nodes rests on the assumption that infectious cases in these outbreaks were all observed. it remains uncertain whether any cases in the observed outbreaks may have been infected by unobserved contacts from outside the hospital or indeed by asymptomatic subjects who remained invisible to the outbreak detection protocol [15]."}
