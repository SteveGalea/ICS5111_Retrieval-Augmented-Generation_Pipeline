{"summary": "in eukaryotic cells, DNA polymerase (Pol) is essential for base excision repair (BER) and involved in recombination and drug resistance (1,2) pol expression levels are important for the maintenance of genome integrity. pol expression levels are important for the maintenance of genome integrity. sequence of the short 3\u2032UTR is highly similar in the rat and human genes (up to 90% of homology in the conserved region) but in the further region of the long 3\u2032UTR similarity abruptly decreases. there is only one (short) Pol transcript in the human cells. the hairpin structure is known to bind a hairpin structure within the 3\u2032UTR of vimentin mRNA. we demonstrate that binding occurs only for a Hax-1 dimer, though RNA binding is not a prerequisite for the dimerization itself. the labeled RNA was again purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. the reaction was carried out at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the transcript was purified from a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. the partial T1 ribonuclease digestion of RNAs was performed at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V and was followed by autoradiography at 80\u00b0C. pGEM-3Z/H, containing 208 bp of the Pol 3\u2032UTR in the sense orientation, was used as a template for mutagenesis. the rat hepatoma FTO-2B cell line was grown on DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) two hundred nanogram of the appropriate plasmid was used for transfection. the activity of Firefly luciferase in lysates was measured using a luciferase reporter assay system.

PCR product was cloned into pET201. pol 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pGEM-3Z and pGEM-4Z vectors. in vitro transcription was carried out with polymerases SP6 and T7. labeled transcripts were gel-purified (5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea) glutaraldehyde cross-linking protein was suspended in 100 l of sample buffer (SB: 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mM potassium acetate, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mM dithiotreitol) the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 l of concentrated loading buffer (150 mM Tris pH 6.8, 6 mM EDTA, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, the reaction mix was loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham) each filter was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (BioRad) using QuantityOne software. isolated nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of CSK buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM surcose, 3 mM MgCl2 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% TritonX-100 with protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]\u2014one tablet per 50 ml), incubated for 3 min at nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of CSK buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM surcose, 3 mM MgCl2 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% TritonX-100 with protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche] at the same concentration as during high-salt preparation. nuclei were ilized in urea buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-HCl pH 8) in 1 ml of isolation buffer (3.75 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.05 mM spermine, 0.125 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and prote Nase T1 exhibits specificity exclusively for guanosines and RNase Cl3 digests C-residues only. prior to the probing experiments, the 5\u2032-end labeled transcript of the Pol short 3\u2032UTR was analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. the result of this test suggests that only a single conformer is formed by the analyzed RNA molecule. three RNA structure modules (M1, M2 and M3), names of loop regions (a\u2013k) and Poly-A signal (122\u2013127 nt) are also marked. module M1 represents a small hairpin structure with a C-rich terminal loop. the hairpin structure is located in the evolutionarily conserved region of the Pol short 3\u2032UTR. sequence alignment was performed using the UCSC Genome Browser and BLAST-Like Alignment Tool. mRNA on expression was analyzed using a luciferase reporter system. the rat hepatoma cell line FTO-2B was transfected with reporter constructs bearing the unmodified luciferase gene. a vector bearing the unmodified luciferase gene served as a control (pCMLuc) mRNA levels were quantitated for each construct by RQ-PCR in cDNA isolated from transfected cells (8 independent transfections) mRNA levels were normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase levels. three-hybrid screen corresponds to the last 150 aa of the Hax-1 protein. it contains a putative Caspase-9-binding region and a transmembrane domain. BH domains and PEST domain are present in N-terminal part. s of the hairpin-containing region (H), a control antisense transcript of the same region (A) and the mutated transcript (Hmut) the cross-linked band migrated at a molecular weight of 100 kDa. the protein dimer is likely formed during the UV-cross-linking procedure. purified recombinant protein was used for chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. RNA is bound exclusively by dimeric Hax-1, hence the dimerization rate may represent an important factor for RNA\u2013protein complex formation. filter-binding assays were performed with increasing amounts of Hax-1 protein and a constant amount of the same test RNAs (hairpin-containing region\u2014H, antisense\u2014A and mutant\u2014Hmut) data were analyzed on a Klotz plot and the apparent Kd for each complex was calculated. s RNA only in the form of a dimer was performed in respect to the dimer concentration. hax-1 localizes in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix. this is not consistent with its transcript-binding properties. and matrin3 western blots were included as markers for chromosomal proteins and nuclear matrix proteins. soluble, chromosomal proteins were released after DNaseI treatment. the protein was washed out in subsequent steps of the preparation. uclease T2 and A recognize all nucleotides but have a higher activity for adenosines and pyrimidines. all the above structural probes recognize flexible and single-stranded regions in the RNA structure. the results suggest that only a single conformer is formed by the analyzed RNA molecule (migrated as a single band on a gel, not shown) the short 3\u2032UTR of Pol transcript forms three separate structural modules. module M1 represents a small hairpin structure with a C-rich terminal loop. the 3\u2032-part of this structure is efficiently hydrolyzed with lead ions. the M2 hairpin structure is located in the evolutionarily conserved region of the Pol short 3\u2032UTR. sequence alignment was performed using the UCSC Genome Browser and BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) software. the rat hepatoma cell line FTO-2B was transfected with reporter constructs bearing the luciferase gene. a vector bearing the unmodified luciferase gene served as a control (pCMLuc) to asses mRNA levels of the reporter, quantitative PCR was performed. control vector (pCMLuc), hairpin-containing construct (pCMLucH) and mutated hairpin (pCMLucHmut) mRNA levels were quantitated for each construct by RQ-PCR in cDNA isolated from transfected cells. positive clone isolated in the three-hybrid screen corresponds to the last 150 aa of the Hax-1 protein, containing a putative Caspase-9-binding region. the BH domains and PEST domain are present in N-terminal part, and therefore they are not necessary for direct RNA binding. UV-cross-linking was performed using purified recombinant Hax-1 and in vitro transcripts of the hairpin-containing region (H), a control antisense transcript of the same region (A) and the mutated transcript (Hmut) no band corresponding in size to monomeric recombinant Hax-1 (ca. 50 kDa) was observed. the band in lane 3 indicates the binding of recombinant Hax-1 to the hairpin element in the 3\u2032UTR; the band is absent in lane 9. controls with antisense RNA, thioredoxin and BSA do not show any interactions. filter-binding assays were performed with increasing amounts of Hax-1 protein and a constant amount of the same test RNAs (hairpin-containing region\u2014H, antisense\u2014A and mutant\u2014Hmut) the apparent Kd for each complex was best when calculations were performed in respect to dimer concentration. dissociation constants were established assuming that the protein binds RNA only in the form of a dimer. curve fitting was performed in respect to the dimer concentration, as a function of total protein concentration. hax-1 localizes in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix. x-1 in the fraction containing matrix proteins was loaded on the gel. histone H2B and matrin3 western blots were included as markers for chromosomal proteins. secondary structure analysis by lead ion hydrolysis and enzymatic digestion revealed the existence of several motifs in the analyzed sequence. only M2 is evolutionary conserved, the rest of the untranslated region has high interspecies sequence variation. the sequence in the conserved region exhibits 86.8% identity to the homologous human sequence (100% in the upper stem region) vimentin and Pol mRNAs are not functionally or evolutionarily related. the presence of U-rich single-stranded regions represents the only similarity between the two structures. the lack of similarities suggests that Hax-1-binding mechanism and affinities might be different for these two structures. hax-1 has been identified as the same trans-acting factor for vimentin and Pol mRNAs. the hairpin element within the 3\u2032UTR of the Pol transcript may also represent a motif directing mRNA to the perinuclear space. some new data support Hax-1 association with the nucleus. the role of Hax-1 in protein import into the nucleus might suggest that it is shuttling between the nuclear matrix and perinuclear space, transporting different cargo molecules. cross-linking also revealed that Hax-1 binds to mRNA only in the form of a dimer. BH domains (BH1 and BH2) present in the N-terminal part of the protein do not take part in the dimerization. the domain responsible for the dimerization is also located in the C-terminal part of the protein."}
