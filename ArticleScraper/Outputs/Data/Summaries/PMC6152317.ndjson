Platyphyllenone (74) and platyphyllonol-5-O--d-xylopyranoside (47) showed high anti-viral activity against Influenza A virus H9N2 with EC50 values of 29.9 and 56.1 M. compounds 12, 14, 22, 33, 37, 38, 45, 46, 48, 49 and 73 isolated from the A. japonica bark and the A. hisuta stem bark showed significant hepatoprotective effects on t-BHP -induced damage to HepG2 cells. authors considered that the cytoprotective effect was closely related to catechol moiety [3,16,80] the extracts of the inner bark of A. incana strongly inhibited the formation of triglyceride-laden mature adipocytes from 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. the diarylheptanoid glycoside oregonin was isolated and confirmed to be the active principle exerting the anti-adipogenic effect in A. incana. oregonin (48) and hirsutenone (73) showed anti-atopic dermatitis effect. the two diarylheptanoids were effective for the treatment of AD. hirsutenone is an attractive source for developing a topical drug for antiatopic dermatitis. compounds 33, 73, 74 and 77 isolated from A. nepalensis showed potential antifilarial activity both in vitro and in vivo studies. alnus dimer (89) and compounds 34 found in A. nepalensis showed potent microfilaricidal (LC100 = 31.2562.5 g/mL, IC50 = 11.0522.10 g/mL) methanol extract of A. glutinosa subsp. glutinosa leaves increased wound tension, contraction capacity and tissue hydroxyproline levels. Shikimic acid (134) was found to be the major compound responsible for the wound healing effect. hirsutenone (73) should be more thoroughly tested as a potential anticancer agent in the future. phytochemical and biological investigations were concentrated on the seven alnus species. little or no attention was paid to other folk medical species. authors hope this review will provide valuable data for the exploration and advanced research on alnus species."}
