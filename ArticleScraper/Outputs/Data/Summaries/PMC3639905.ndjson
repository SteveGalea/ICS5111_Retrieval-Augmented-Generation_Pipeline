{"summary": "baicalein treatment reduced eotaxin production in human fibroblasts. there are no reports of its anti-asthma activity or its effect on airway injury. results show baicalein can attenuate important features of asthma. epithelial clumps have been found in sputum (creola bodies) and bronchoalveolar lavage of asthmatic patients. recent reports have highlighted the critical role of epithelial stress in deciding the immune responses within the lung. restoring mitochondrial function of airway epithelia is sufficient to reduce acute lung injury. baicalein reduces neuronal injury [16], [17], and inhibits retinal epithelial apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide [18]. male Balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and treated with different concentrations of BAIC from the onset of allergen challenge. induced mice were associated with a significant reduction in AHR. male Balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged. AHRs were determined on day 33. IL-4, IL-13, IFN-, TLR-2, TLR-4, OVA specific IgE, IgG2a, eotaxin levels and airway inflammation score. eotaxin levels and airway inflammation score were confirmed. eotaxin levels were significantly higher in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice. the increase in eotaxin levels was associated with an increase in the recruitment of eosinophils in the airway in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice. both TLR-2 and TLR-4 were found to be increased in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. BAIC treatment to allergic mice was associated with a significant decrease in TLR-2 levels, but TLR-4 levels were unchanged. diameters of bronchi taken for morphometry analysis were 326.916.0 m, 339.623.3 m, and 326.447.3 m for SHAM/PBS/VEH, OVA/OVA/VEH and OVA/OVA/BAIC respectively. dense accumulation of collagen was found in sub-epithelial regions of bronchi compared to normal control mice. the OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice showed asthma features such as MCh induced AHR and airway inflammation after 6 days OVA challenge. BAIC treatment was therefore started after 6 days of OVA challenge, but with the continuation of OVA challenge. male Balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged for 12 consecutive days. or IL-4 was administered to nave mice, which were given intranasal IL-13 or IL-4. administration of IL-13 led to a significant increase in AHR and airway inflammation. however, administration of IL-13 treated mice led to a significant reduction in both AHR and airway inflammation. 15-LOX metabolites such as 13-S-HODE and 9-S-HODE are generated in high concentrations during mitochondrial degradation in the reticulocytes. 15-LOX is also found to be increased in bronchial epithelia in human asthmatic conditions. mitochondrial dysfunction seems crucial in pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases including asthma. subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase was found to be expressed in bronchi of the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. BAIC restored the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and complex I with the restoration of subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase. the OVA/OVA/VEH mice showed increased levels of cytochrome c in the lung cytosol compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. however, the OVA/OVA/VEH mice also showed a significant reduction of cytochrome c in the cytosol. 8-isoprostane was found to be significantly increased in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. increased cytochrome c stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. we measured levels of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in BAL fluid supernatants. BAIC reduces IL-13 induced mitochondrial dysfunction and bronchial epithelial injury. we determined the features of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic assay in lung sections from IL-13 treated mice. male balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA. single chamber plethysmography was performed to determine the effect of baicalein (BAIC) on asthma features. invasive airway mechanics results expressed as airway resistance. representative photomicrographs of Haematoxylin and Eosin staining were shown. e) Absolute cell count in BAL fluid was determined as described in Materials and Methods. eotaxin levels were significantly higher in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. BAIC treatment reduced the eotaxin levels significantly compared to the OVA/OVA/VEH mice. otaxin levels associated with increase in recruitment of eosinophils in the airway in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice. baicalein treatment reduced airway eosinophilia. to determine the effect of BAIC on goblet cell metaplasia, we performed periodic acid-Schiff staining on the lung sections. the OVA/OVA/VEH mice displayed the increased goblet cell metaplasia and BAIC treatment reduced it. dense accumulation of collagen was found in sub-epithelial regions of bronchi and around vascular regions in allergic control mice compared to normal control mice. this was further confirmed by morphometry. the effect of BAIC on the levels and expression of TGF-1 was determined. male Balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged for 12 consecutive days as shown in Fig. 1A. male Balb/c mice were treated with baicalein from day 27 to 32. a significant reduction in both AHR and airway inflammation induced by IL-13 or IL-4. mice administered with IL-4 also showed an increase in AHR and airway inflammation. 15-LOX preferentially utilizes linoleic acid (LA) to produce 9 and 13-(S)-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acids (HODEs) and also minimally utilizes arachidonic acid (AA) to produce 12-(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) [23] cytochrome c oxidase activity was decreased in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. also, there was a reduction in complex I activity in lung mitochondria. the high expression of subunit III in bronchi may relate to vulnerability to inflammatory insults [24] caspase 3 and caspase 12 mice had increased enzymatic activities. baicalein reduced bronchial epithelial injury and restores mitochondrial ultrastructural changes in bronchial epithelia of asthmatic lungs. increased cytochrome c stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. we measured the levels of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the OVA/OVA/VEH mice compared to the SHAM/PBS/VEH mice. however, BAIC treatment significantly restored the mitochondria to its normal architecture. cytochrome c oxidase activity in lung mitochondria and reduction in cytochrome c in lung cytosol. baicalein reduced caspase 3 activity and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia. baicalein reduces mitochondrial dysfunction, reduces airway injury and attenuates various features of airway inflammation. we used allergic models and Th2 cytokine models to demonstrate the efficacy of baicalein in preventing airway injury. reduction of 13-S-HODE and 9-S-HODE are interesting in asthmatic lungs. baicalein treatment is associated with restoration of mitochondrial functions. reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction and restoration of ultra structural changes by baicalein may be due to 15-LOX inhibition. baicalein has anti-fibrotic properties in in vitro studies. it is likely linked to inhibition of epithelial injury and pro-survival effects. baicalein treatment to either allergic or Th2 cytokine induced mice reduces airway epithelial injury, ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, and various features of airway inflammation in a mouse models. all animals (8\u201310 weeks old male BALB/c mice were obtained from National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India or Central Drug Research Institute, Delhi, India) in preventive model, there were 3 groups (n = 6 in each): SHAM/PBS/VEH, OVA/OVA/VEH and OVA/OVA/BAIC (baicalein, 10 mg/kg) in both models, mice were sensitized on days 0, 7, and 14 with 50 g OVA adsorbed in 4 mg alum or 4 mg alum. in 1% BSA or 1% BSA alone was instilled into the nasal openings of each isoflurane-anesthetized mouse, twice a day for 2 days. mice were treated with BAIC or VEH intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a day for two days. AHR measurement and euthanasia were performed on day 3. TEM was performed in another portion of lung to assess inflammatory changes. airway mucin content and collagen deposition were determined. mitochondria isolation and cytosolic separation were performed [10] from lung. 8-OHdG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was measured in lung homogenates by competitive ELISA. results were expressed in pg/100 l BAL fluid supernatants. complex I activity in lung mitochondria, caspase 3 activity and cytochrome c levels in lung cytosols were determined. human bronchial epithelia and muc5ac ELISA were pretreated with vehicle (DMSO) or different concentrations of baicalein (7.5 M, 15 M and 30 M) after 48 hrs of IL-13 induction, cells were harvested and the levels of mucin were determined in cell lysates. /VEH (normal controls, VEH-vehicle), OVA/OVA/VEH (OVA controls, OVA, chicken egg ovalbumin, Grade V, Sigma) and OVA/OVA/BAIC 0.1, 1, and 10 (0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg baicalein, respectively, Cayman) in preventive model, there were 3 groups (n = 6 in each) 3 g (30 l) carrier-free recombinant murine IL-13 or IL-4 (R&D Systems) in 1% BSA or 1% BSA alone was instilled into the nasal openings of each isoflurane-anesthetized mouse, twice a day for 2 days. mice were treated with BAIC or VEH intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a day for two days. fixed lungs were dissected using a dissection microscope. slices from these bronchi were further processed, stained and viewed with TEM. 8-isoprostane and 8-OHdG 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation, were measured in lung homogenates by competitive ELISA. results were expressed in pg/25 g protein. the numbers of apoptotic cells are expressed as a percentage of the whole epithelial cell population (apoptotic index) the numbers of apoptotic cells are expressed as a percentage of the whole epithelial cell population."}
