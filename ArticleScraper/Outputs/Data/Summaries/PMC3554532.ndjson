{"summary": "the DRiP hypothesis proposed that defective ribosomal products are a major source of peptides for MHC class I processing pathway. this is likely due to the low abundance of DRiPs relative to the abundance of folded proteins, which poses a significant challenge to biochemical/molecular technologies. top 20 viruses based on number of tested peptides are shown in Table 1. vaccinia virus contributed the greatest number of tested peptides. hepatitis C Virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, human herpesvirus 5/4 and influenza A virus. 93 viruses were studied for each organism. a total of 20 viruses with the highest number of tested peptides are shown. positional bias of known MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes from viruses. a probability ratio plot is shown in Fig. 1C to show positional bias of epitopes. the probability ratio plot shows under representation of epitopes at N- and C-termini. if positional bias is present, regions with lower likelihoods of finding epitopes would show values less than 1. peptides with hydrophobic anchor residues would impose positional bias of epitopes. peptide:MHC-I binding algorithms have achieved high accuracies in benchmarks [9], [10]. SMMPMBEC was used to make binding predictions [12]. binding affinities for the tested peptides and their normalized positions showed no systematic effects. for each supertype, 9-mer peptide binding predictions were carried out. ratios of probability masses of predicted \u2018binders\u2019 and \u2018non-binders\u2019 were calculated. if residue positions are used instead of normalized positions, positional bias of epitopes may result. a boxplot shows confidence intervals of means of conservation scores as a function of normalized position. this reveals a pattern of positional bias of conservation, where ends of proteins are less conserved than their cores. for each viral protein which also contained at least one tested peptide from Table 1, conservation scores were calculated using Rate4Site [26] the bins used are of variable lengths to ensure a sufficient count in each bin. each bin contains 20% of data points. the difference between the means of the two conservation score distributions is statistically significant. viral epitopes in the context of immunization with peptides display similar level of conservation as non-epitopes. one explanation is that immune recognition machinery has evolved to preferably recognize epitopes that are conserved. another explanation is that viral sequences are variable, and responses against epitopes from conserved regions could be higher in individuals exposed to multiple variants of a virus over time. top 20 viruses based on number of tested peptides are shown in Table 1. vaccinia virus contributed the greatest number of tested peptides. hepatitis C Virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, human herpesvirus 5/4 and influenza A virus. 93 viruses were studied. for brevity, 20 viruses with the highest number of tested peptides are shown in the table. positional bias of known MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes from viruses. if positional bias is present, regions with lower likelihoods of finding epitopes would show values less than 1. probability ratio plots generated after cumulative exclusion of data from vaccinia virus and hepatitis C virus resulted in maintaining the overall pattern. e:MHC-I binding algorithms have achieved high accuracies in benchmarks [9], [10]. using 9-mer peptides generated from a set viral proteins, we made binding predictions to human MHC-I molecules. for each supertype, we generated distributions of normalized positions for predicted \u2018binders\u2019 and \u2018non-binders\u2019. peptide binding predictions were made for alleles belonging to each supertype. all possible 9-mer peptides were generated from a set of viral proteins. the results reflect results reported in [14], where mammalian, bacterial, and viral proteomes show lack of influence of MHC class I binding preferences. however, in same work, A02 and B07 supertypes showed bias in signal-peptide regions (i.e. N-terminal) conservation scores were normalized for each protein. each box covers 25th and 75th percentiles. positives tend to be more conserved than negatives. the difference between the means of the two conservation score distributions is statistically significant. welch's t-test; one-sided; p-value = 5.9106) we retrieved viral epitopes identified in the context of peptide immunization, rather than with viral infection. the difference between the two distributions is not statistically significant. this leads us to favor the hypothesis that enhanced immune recognition of conserved viral peptides is due to extrinsic effects. the central bias of viral epitopes reflects the combined effects of positional bias of epitope sequence conservation and induction of memory CD8+ T cells by exposure to heterologous boosts. the connection between positional biases with protein conservation is reasonable in the context of boosting effects associated with repeated vaccine administrations. the principle idea behind boosting is that those epitopes already exposed to the immune system tend to dominate in the following exposure [16] the idea is interesting and may be pursued in a future study. other investigators have also reported epitope conservation for HIV [22], [23] and TB [24]. es from the Immune Epitope Database For each virus listed in Table 1, we retrieved MHC-I restricted T-cell epitopes from the IEDB. the query should retrieve epitopes derived from proteins newly expressed in a host cell, rather than epitopes recognized after peptide or protein immunization. only for newly synthesized epitopes can defective ribosomal products skew the positional distribution of epitopes in antigens epitope positions can be made relative to the polyprotein or to final cleavage products. to carry out mapping, we used NCBI's BLAST with a default setting to search for presence of epitopes in antigens. we required homology between the originally curated source antigen of the epitope and the antigen in the reference genome. e positions and uniformly sampled peptides from a set of proteins followed by mapping the peptides onto the proteins with BLAST. we then grouped the normalized positions into \u2018positives\u2019 and \u2018negatives\u2019, and binned using 5 bins of equal intervals covering a range [0,1], resulting in probability mass functions. a set of Perl scripts retrieved from the ConSurf website. retrieved MHC-I restricted T-cell epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database. the query should retrieve epitopes derived from proteins newly expressed in a host cell, rather than epitopes recognized after peptide or protein immunization. using the source antigens listed in the IEDB, epitope positions can be made relative to the polyprotein or to final cleavage products. to carry out the mapping, we used NCBI's BLAST with a default setting to search for presence of epitopes in antigens. we required homology between the originally curated source antigen of the epitope and the antigen in the reference genome. random sampled peptide positions and uniformly sampled peptides from a set of proteins, followed by mapping the peptides onto the proteins with BLAST. we then grouped the normalized positions into \u2018positives\u2019 and \u2018negatives\u2019, and binned using 5 bins of equal intervals covering a range [0,1]. a multiple sequence alignment was generated for each protein by running a sequence of PSI-BLASTCD-HITMUSCLE against the NCBI Non-Redundant database. the alignment returned residue position-specific conservation scores. the curve labeled \u2018v+h\u2019 refers to exclusion of data from vaccinia virus and hepatitis C virus. table S2 HLA supertypes and their member alleles used for peptide binding predictions. only those HLA alleles for which IEDB's SMMPMBEC has 9-mer predictors are shown."}
