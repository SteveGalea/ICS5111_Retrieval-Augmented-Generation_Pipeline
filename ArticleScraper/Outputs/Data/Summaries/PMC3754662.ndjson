{"summary": "respiratory tract infections (RTIs) have an enormous social economic impact, with a high incidence of hospitalization and high direct and indirect costs. timely detection and discrimination of the infecting pathogens is crucial in order to optimize treatment and care, to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use, and to prevent secondary spread of infection (2, 4\u20136) the Prodesse ProFAST+ assay (GenProbe, San Diego, CA) is a multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and discrimination of influenza A virus subtypes. the Prodesse ProFLU+ and ProFAST+ assays were cleared for in vitro diagnostic use by the FDA in 2008 and 2010 respectively. the Verigene RV+ is a multiplex PCR with gold nanoparticle probe-based hybridization of virus-specific amplicons on a microarray. subtyping of influenza viruses is based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA sequences. most seasonal H1N1 viruses are oseltamivir-resistant, while most of the pandemic H1 2009 and seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir clinical study was prospective, biological specimen collection study from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute RTI in an outpatient setting for a network of 15 general practitioners. the probability of enriching the sample collection with influenza virus-containing samples was augmented by implementing an influenza epidemiological surveillance guided sampling campaign. samples were stored at 80\u00b0C in aliquots until specific testing was performed. a 1:1.5 dilution was created in UTM and used for all assays. the internal extraction control B (IEC-B) was produced as described earlier (20) RNA was recovered and eluted in 30 l of prewarmed elution buffer. a 1:10 dilution series was made in extraction buffer 3. a standard curve was constructed by plotting each cycle threshold (CT) value against the log10 quantity of the standard RNA copy numbers.

Previously conducted studies have compared the performances of a single FDA-cleared test to either conventional cell culture methods, in-house PCRs, Luminex xTAG RVP assays. but none of these studies compared more than two FDA-cleared assays to each other. early detection of respiratory pathogens has implications for patient quarantine strategy and treatment. the early discrimination between cluster I and II influenza viruses could influence treatment decisions for the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies."}
