{"summary": "changes in the maternal gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems affect drug absorption. increased blood flow to the stomach and small intestine, resulting from changes in the cardiovascular system, increases absorption of drugs taken orally. plasma volume increases by 30%\u201350% during pregnancy to meet the increased requirements of uterine-placental circulation. activity of certain liver cytochromes (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2D6) is increased during pregnancy. but activity of CYP1A2 is decreased during pregnancy. increases in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy also alter hepatic enzyme activity. potential adverse effects of exposure on embryo or fetus include spontaneous pregnancy loss, structural malformations, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, hearing loss, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. teratogenic medications have a narrow window of exposure when their use results in malformations. animal studies can be useful in evaluating an agent's potential for adverse reproductive effects. but they are not always predictive of the effects in humans. these data take the form of adverse event reports, case series, prospective exposure registries, and cohort and case-control studies. fetal risk is relatively unlikely because of negative results in animal studies and no human studies. positive results in animal studies or evidence of human fetal risk may outweigh risks. use in pregnant women is contraindicated. some of these products (e.g., ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and doxcycline) are commonly used in routine healthcare. others (e.g., smallpox and anthrax vaccines) are reserved for emergency preparedness and response activities and for deployed military personnel. the public health and medical communities have faced several emerging infectious disease outbreaks, including SARS and monkeypox. the outbreak of 2003, caused by a newly identified coronavirus, affected >8,000 people worldwide (22) reports suggest that the clinical course and outcomes of SARS might be more severe for pregnant than for nonpregnant women. in 2003, the first outbreak of monkeypox in the western Hemisphere occurred in the united states (27) smallpox vaccination during pregnancy poses a low risk for fetal vaccinia, which can lead to preterm birth, and neonatal death (30,31) pregnant women are considered a high-risk group and are recommended to receive influenza vaccination during interpandemic years (35) chemoprophylaxis will be an important option for pregnant women. ciprofloxacin is not recommended during pregnancy if efficacious alternatives are available. ciprofloxacin is not recommended during pregnancy if efficacious alternatives are available. asymptomatic pregnant women exposed to B. anthracis during the 2001 anthrax attacks. prophylaxis be limited to women exposed to a confirmed environmental contamination or a high-risk source. in 2003, the united states embarked on an effort to vaccinate public health and medical bioterrorism response teams against smallpox. prophylaxis and treatment of pregnant women must take into account risks associated with specific medications or vaccines versus the risk for illness and death from a possible infectious exposure. clinicians should become familiar with pre-event response plans."}
