{"summary": "METHODS Epidemiologic Investigation Methods We interviewed and collected serum specimens from available members of the initial outbreak. participants were employed at one of these hospitals or at JMoH during February\u2013April 2012. recombinant btHKU5.2 nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA was developed by the CDC to detect the presence of antibodies that cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein in serum samples. if cross-reactive antibodies were detected in serum samples, confirmation of MERS-specific antibodies was determined by either MERS-CoV MNT or IFA. serum from human metapneumovirus, H1N1 was not available for evaluation. serum from HKU1 mouse hyperimmune serum did not cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein. controls were included for each assay performed, including the input virus back titration and mock-infected cells. all assay results were confirmed in 3 separate assays, and representative data are presented. recombinant btHKU5.2 nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA was developed by the CDC to detect the presence of antibodies that cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein in serum samples. the recombinant btHKU5.2 nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA was developed by the CDC to detect the presence of antibodies that cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein. the overall specificity of the assay was determined after screening 545 serum samples from donors in the united states and the Middle East. serum samples were titered with serial 4-fold dilutions (1:100\u20131:6400) and further evaluated using MERS-CoV (Hu/Jordan-N3/2012) the neutralization titer was measured as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited Vero cell monolayer lysis in at least 1 of the 3 triplicate wells. controls were included for each MNT assay performed, including the input virus back titration and mock-infected cells. the subject who did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies was test-positive both by HKU5.2N ELISA and by a confirmative IFA. all but 1 also had detectable neutralizing antibody titers as determined by MNT. outbreak members 01 and 12 were previously laboratory-confirmed positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. a sample with a 20 titer was considered negative for the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. a sample with a 20 titer was considered negative for the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. two criteria constitute a positive result: HKU5.2N ELISA must be positive and the MERS-CoV_Jordan IFA or MNT must be positive. some were retrospectively determined to be MERS-CoV test negative. a total of 9 people in this outbreak had evidence of MERS-CoV infections by acute rRT-PCR tests (n = 2) or convalescent antibody tests (n = 7) each serologic test\u2013positive subject had unprotected MERS-CoV exposure(s) to at least 1 rRT-PCR test-positive subject. an additional 8 subjects had single positive test results by either HKU5.2N ELISA or IFA, but their MERS-CoV antibody status was considered indeterminate twelve household subjects were 18 years old, all of whom were serologically test negative. no evidence of immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant medications/therapies among any of these subjects. one subject had an atrial septal defect, 2 had a history of hypertension, 2 were smokers at the time of illness, and 1 reported a pregnancy of 5 months\u2019 gestation. nea Chest pain Sore throat Fever Cough Dyspnea Fever Chills Malaise Chest pain Fever Cough Dyspnea Fever Chills Malaise Chest pain Fever Cough Dyspnea Fever Rhinorrhea Headache Cough Abbreviations: HHM, household member;

6 subjects (75%) required respiratory support with at least supplemental oxygen. vated leukocyte counts (>11 109/L) were observed during the course for 2 subjects (25%), both of whom died. these included evidence of elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (>40 U/L) and significant coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio of >1.5, as well as thrombocytopenia (140 109/L) a total of 97 healthcare personnel worked during February\u2013April, 2012. these included 8 surviving outbreak members who were healthcare personnel at the focal outbreak hospital and were not lost to follow-up. our investigation provided no evidence of MERS-CoV infections or transmission events among healthcare personnel. one subject had an atrial septal defect, 2 had a history of hypertension, 2 were smokers at the time of illness, and 1 reported a pregnancy of 5 months\u2019 gestation. none of the subjects reported here had a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. eight subjects presented for hospital care a median of 5 days after symptom onset (range, 1\u201314 days) of these patients, 7 (88%) had cough, 7 (88%) had documented fever, 6 (75%) had dyspnea, 5 (63%) had chest pain, and 5 (63%) had malaise at some point during their disease course.
