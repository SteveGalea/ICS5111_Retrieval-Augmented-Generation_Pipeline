{"summary": "the Stabile Research Building is an SPF, viral antibody-free murine facility with a separate quarantine that is located outside of the murine facility proper. the program and facilities for animal care and use are fully AAALAC-accredited, and all animals were housed and used in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols. NSGS mice were purchased and used to establish an intramural colony. individual mice from this intramural NSGS colony were reassigned to an IACUC-approved research protocol to serve as recipients for CMML PDX. real-time PCR analysis was performed by using standard primer and probe concentrations. swabs of each IVC interior and swabs of each IVC rack exhaust plenum interior were collected and PCR-analyzed. the CMML PDX-recipient NSGS mice were euthanized. s were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by a secondary physical method of euthanasia. unfractionated bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human patients with CMML were used as PDX and administered to irradiated NSGS mice. each of the NSGS mice received 1 to 4 106 human CMML mononuclear cells by tail-vein injection. mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood were stained with Zombie Violet (thermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA) to confirm cell viability, fixed with 1.6% formaldehyde, and stained with the following antibodies. all samples were evaluated by using flow cytometry (model LSRII, BD Biosciences), and FACS data were analysed by using FloJo software. survey questions were developed with the help of the Survey Methods Core (H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center) survey questions were emailed to attending veterinarians overseeing murine colonies at each of 50 NCI-designated Comprehensive cancer centers. NSGS mice were purchased and used to establish an intramural colony. individual mice from this intramural colony were reassigned to an IACUC-approved research protocol to serve as recipients for CMML PDX engraftment. ation caging (Blueline, Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) was used to collect environmental specimens from equipment surfaces. swabs of IVC rack exhaust plenums or IVC primary enclosures or fecal pellets of mice were submitted to an outside laboratory for C. bovis real-time PCR testing. serial C. bovis PCR monitoring of 153 specimens from 60 mice. the 13 IVC interiors in which mice were housed on 2 IVC racks. the CMML PDX-recipient NSGS mice were euthanized. 106 human CMML mononuclear cells by tail-vein injection weighed at least 3 times weekly. mice were monitored twice daily and weighed at least 3 times weekly. euthanasia is preceded by thrombocytopenia in engrafted mice. all samples were evaluated by using flow cytometry (model LSRII, BD Biosciences), and FACS data were analyzed by using FloJo software. unpaired t tests were performed by using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) mice housed in 13 IVC primary enclosures for 87 d by using PCR evaluation of murine fecal pellets and swab specimens collected from each IVC primary enclosure. most (that is, 39 of 60) of the mice remained asymptomatic and C. bovis-PCR negative throughout the 87-d study. the remaining 21 mice developed hyperkeratosis and remained persistently C. bovis PCR-positive through study clinical endpoints and all CMML PDX-recipient mice were euthanized at clinical endpoints of study and showed piloerection, hunched posture, reduced activity, and weight loss. each of the PCR-positive mice yielded skin specimens consistent with the cutaneous pathology of C. bovis infection. human CMML mononuclear cells, including dysplastic cells resembling the human pathologic specimen, were readily noted to have infiltrated the lung, spleen, liver, and bone marrow of C. bovis PCR-negative mice. these postmortem impressions were confirmed by the FACS analyses of cells isolated from either the murine spleen, bone marrow, or peripheral blood. CMML PDX-recipient NSGS mice and (B) a smaller spleen from a C. bovis PCR-positive CMML PDX-recipient NSGS mouse received the same PDX. CMML blasts and dysplastic binucleated cells (arrows) infiltrating the (A) liver and (D) spleen of C. bovis PCR-positive CMML PDX-recipient NS cancer centers also indicated (25% each) either culling only; culling and treating only; culling and quarantining only; and culling, treating, and quarantining hyperkeratotic immunodeficient mice as practices implemented in response to a C. bovis clinical case. most respondents were either unsure whether biologics were tested for C. bovis in advance of use (9%) or stated that no effort was implemented (43%) the CMML PDX mouse model is vital to understanding CMML pathogenesis and developing improved therapeutic approaches. the CMML model metrics were significantly decreased in the C. bovis PCR-positive cohort that we describe here. CMML CD45+ cellular infiltrates in the spleen of PDX-recipient C. bovis PCR-positive mice resulted in greater (P = 0.0150) splenomegaly than that of a C. bovis PCR-positive mouse that received the same PDX mononuclear cell isolate from the same CMML donor patient. the integrity of preclinical research data obtained by using immunodeficient strains is measurably despite being among the more egregious of opportunistic outbreaks affecting immunodeficient mice, most facilities do not test or attempt to characterize the extent of environmental contamination caused by a clinical case of C. bovis hyperkeratosis. c. bovis hyperkeratosis is already broadly PCR-detectable in murine inventory, in the interior of the IVC rack exhaust plenum, in the air-handling unit, on neighboring equipment surfaces, on core imaging equipment, and on shared computer keyboards. asymptomatic C. bovis PCR-positive immunodeficient cohort may no longer be reliable and the study no longer valid. murine facilities should routinely PCR test for C. bovis. VHP sterilize all equipment and rooms at regular intervals."}
