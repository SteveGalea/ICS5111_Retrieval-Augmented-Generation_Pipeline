{"summary": "the interferon-inducible restriction factor BST2 has a short cytoplasmic tail at the N-terminus followed by a single transmembrane (TM) helix. the short intracellular, N-terminal tail of BST2 has been implicated in the natural trafficking of this antiviral protein. this interaction is species-specific and essential for the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu. part of Vpu's activity against BST2 can be explained by viral hijacking of the -TrCP-associated ubiquitin\u2013proteasome degradation pathway. both recycled and newly synthesized BST2 are retained at the TGN. both recycled and newly synthesized BST2 are retained at the TGN. mutations in the juxta-membrane hinge region of Vpu that interfere with the localization of Vpu to the TGN impair the antagonism of BST2. five AP complexes exist in the cell and each is responsible for trafficking by distinct routes. AP1 traffics cargo between the TGN and sorting endosomes. AP2 selects cargo for transport between the plasma membrane and early endosomes. a three-component complex containing AP1, the cytoplasmic domain of BST2 (BST2CD) and the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu (VpuCD) showed that Vpu mimics a membrane cargo by occupying the acidic dileucine-binding site of AP1 while BST2 is bound at the tyrosine-binding site of AP1. this suggests that HIV-1 Vpu is a virally encoded modulator of a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed binding to 1, but not 2 or 3 in the Y2H assay. a mutant 1 subunit (1 D174A) with disrupted binding pocket was abolished by the double alanine mutation of the YxY motif in BST2CD. the BST2CD-1 interaction is abolished by the tyrosine motif mutation Y6/8A in BST2CD or the tyrosine-binding pocket mutation D174A in 1. BST2 does not interact with the appendage domain of AP2. we hypothesized that Vpu binds AP1 at the acidic dileucine-binding site. to test this, we created a truncated AP1 core with the 1-CTD removed. such a truncation construct (AP1t) mimics the open conformation of AP1. size exclusion chromatograms and SDS PAGE analysis of purified MBP-VpuCD constructs and its mixture with 1-truncated AP1 (AP1t) the elution profile of MBP-VpuCD on the size exclusion column is altered in the presence of AP1t (marked by the red arrow). the molecular weight measured by mass spectrometry confirms that VpuCD is doubly phosphorylated. we used size exclusion chromatography to test the binding between Vpu and a truncated hemicomplex of AP2 and AP3. we used a fusion of BST2CD and VpuCD to mimic in vitro the membrane-assisted binding that occurs in cells. the fusion protein exhibited strong binding to the GST-tagged AP1 in the pulldown assay. alanine mutation of the YxY motif (Y6/8A) greatly reduced the binding to AP1. binding between endogenous AP1 (the 1subunit) and this chimera was detected. binding between endogenous AP1 and this chimera was detected. no such binding was detected for either BST2 or Vpu alone. mutations of either Y6/8 or ELV did not substantially reduce binding. mutant combining both sets of mutations was unable to bind AP1. the binding of Vpu to AP1 is independent of serine-phosphorylation. the unphosphorylated fusion protein bound AP1 as tightly as the phosphorylated construct. the binding of AP1 was not affected by the double mutation. the structure reveals how Vpu enhances the native interaction between BST2 and AP1. AP1 is colored by subunit (1 in gray, orange, 1 in green and 1 in yellow) the difference Fourier map (mFo-DFc at 3 level, blue mesh) of VpuCD (cyan sticks) binding to 1 (yellow surface) and (orange surface) subunits of AP1 shows that the Vpu ELV motif (cyan) binds in the same way as the canonical peptide (gray) Y8 of BST2CD forms the canonical interactions with 1 residues and inserts into the conserved tyrosine-binding pocket on 1. compared to the canonical cases in which a leucine or isoleucine residue is found at the Y+3 position, V11 in BST2 fills the corresponding hydrophobic pocket on 1. the presence of 2 Q318, in place of the smaller N308 of 1, disrupts a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain of BST2 Y6. the structural difference is much more pronounced: severe steric clashes appear to prevent the binding of BST2 Y6. this is the first structural example of a cellular YxY-based sorting signal bound to the 1 subunit of AP1. the AP1 in the BST2/Vpu-bound structure adopts a conformation that is much more open than the previously observed structures. the conformational change involves a 20\u00b0 rotation of /1 around an axis at the base of where it contacts 1, with the largest C movement of 35 at the tip of. this new \u20131 interface has a buried surface area of 685 2. AP1 adopts a novel open conformation when bound to BST2CD and VpuCD. overlay of the Arf1-bound AP1 structure (PDB ID 4HMY, grey surface) Vpu residues R44 and L45 (NL4-3 sequence, corresponding to I45 of Vpu HV1S1 used in the structural study) upstream of ELV may participate in the interaction with AP1. affinity pulldown assays using an AP1 with GST-tagged subunit (B) or using a His-tagged MBP-1-CTD (C) significantly affected the binding interactions. Vpu R44A:L45A and S52N:S56N mutations each impair Vpu mediated-virion release, and their effects are additive. gp120 is the viral envelope glycoprotein; gp120 is the viral envelope glycoprotein. the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on the activity of Vpu as an antagonist of BST2 in human cells. the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on virion release was additive with the S52/56N mutation, which ablates the binding of Vpu to -TrCP. the helical feature of the first half of VpuCD was shown to be relatively more pronounced. the latter helix harbored the ELV sequence was more likely to be unstructured. the mutation Y6/8A in BST2CD markedly impaired virion release. HEK293T cells were co-transfected to express the indicated BST2 variants. mutations of the BST2 YxY, Vpu ELV and S52/S56 (\u20182/6\u2019) sequences have additive effects in decreasing the efficiency of Vpu mediated- virion release. HT1080 cells expressing wild type BST2 and Y6/8A mutant were transfected to express Vpu. all three proteins co-localized at the cell center when Vpu was expressed. mutation of the YxY sequence of BST2 and to a lesser extent the ELV sequence of Vpu caused mislocalization of the proteins from the cell center region. the wild type chimera co-localized with AP1 at the perinuclear region. yxy and ELV mutations decreased the co-localization of the chimera and caused displacement of the chimera to peripheral endosomes and the plasma membrane. mutant chimera localized to the cell center with AP1 as expected. Y6/8A-ELV/AAA mutant colocalized less well with AP1. enhanced surface expression was detected for the mutant chimera. BST2CD exhibited binding to 1, but not 2 or 3 in the Y2H assay. mutant 1 subunit (1 D174A) with disrupted binding pocket for tyrosine-based motifs bound neither TGN38 nor the BST2CD. this binding was abolished by the double alanine mutation of the YxY motif in BST2CD. the BST2CD-1 interaction is abolished by the tyrosine motif mutation Y6/8A in BST2CD or the tyrosine-binding pocket mutation D174A in 1.

GST bead-bound AP-1 captured MBP-BST2CD-VpuCD. but not MBP-VpuCD or MBP-BST2CD alone. alanine mutations of either Y6/8 or ELV did not substantially reduce binding. mutant combining both sets of mutations was unable to bind AP1. 'no FLAG' indicates mock transfection without any FLAG-tagged construct. the binding of Vpu to AP1 is independent of serine-phosphorylation. the unphosphorylated fusion protein bound AP1 as tightly as the phosphorylated construct. the binding of AP1 was not affected by the double mutation, S52/56N. the structure reveals how Vpu enhances the native interaction between BST2 and AP1. AP1 is colored by subunit (1 in gray, orange, 1 in green and 1 in yellow) the difference Fourier map (mFo-DFc at 3 level, blue mesh) of VpuCD (cyan sticks) binding to 1 (yellow surface) and (orange surface) subunits of AP1 shows that the Vpu ELV motif (cyan) binds in the same way as the canonical peptide (gray) the observed interface differs from the canonical tyrosine peptide (Yxx) binding. Y8 of BST2CD forms the interactions with 1 residues and inserts into the conserved tyrosine-binding pocket on 1. for 1, valine was disfavored at the Y+3 position, whereas leucine was favored. the presence of 2 Q318, in place of the smaller N308 of 1, disrupts a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain of BST2 Y6. severe steric clashes appear to prevent the binding of BST2 Y6. this is the first structural example of a cellular YxY-based sorting signal bound to the 1 subunit of AP1. the AP1 in the BST2/Vpu-activated structure adopts a conformation that is much more open than the previously observed structures. the conformational change involves a 20\u00b0 rotation of /1 around an axis at the base of where it contacts 1, with the largest C movement of 35 at the tip of. AP1 adopts a novel open conformation when bound to BST2CD and VpuCD. arrows point to the large relative movement of the /1 subunits of our structure. Vpu residues R44 and L45 (NL4-3 sequence, corresponding to I45 of Vpu HV1S1 used in the structural study) upstream of ELV may participate in the interaction with AP1. affinity pulldown assays using an AP1 with GST-tagged subunit (B) or using a His-tagged MBP-1-CTD (C) significantly affected the binding interactions. Vpu R44A:L45A and S52N:S56N mutations each impair Vpu mediated-virion release, and their effects are additive. gp120 is the viral envelope glycoprotein; gp120 is the viral envelope glycoprotein. we characterized the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on the activity of Vpu as an antagonist of BST2 in human cells. the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on virion release was additive with the S52/56N mutation. both mutations impair the apparent degradation of BST2. the helical feature of the first half of VpuCD was shown to be relatively more pronounced. the latter helix harbored the ELV sequence was more likely to be unstructured. the mutation Y6/8A in BST2CD markedly impaired virion release. HEK293T cells were co-transfected to express the indicated BST2 variants, provirus lacking vpu, and the indicated codon-optimized Vpu proteins. mutations of the BST2 YxY, Vpu ELV and S52/S56 sequences have additive effects in decreasing the efficiency of Vpu mediated- virion release. HT1080 cells expressing wild type BST2 or the Y6/8A mutant were transfected to express Vpu. all three proteins co-localized at the cell center when Vpu was expressed. mutation of the YxY sequence of BST2 and to a lesser extent the ELV sequence of Vpu caused mislocalization of the proteins from the cell center region. the wild type chimera co-localized with AP1 at the perinuclear region. yxy and ELV mutations decreased the co-localization of the chimera and AP1. the chimera has the advantage of \u2018forcing\u2019 the interaction between the two proteins. mutant chimera localized to the cell center with AP1 as expected. Y6/8A-ELV/AAA mutant colocalized less well with AP1. enhanced surface expression was detected for the mutant chimera. Nef uses AP2 to remove BST2 from the cell surface to allow for the efficient release of progeny virions. in addition, the HIV-2 Env protein antagonizes BST2 through an AP2-dependent mistrafficking mechanism. this is conceptually similar to the HIV-1 Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation but occurs through different interaction mechanisms with AP1. the transmembrane interaction between BST2 and Vpu causes an open conformation of AP1 that has not been observed before. this new conformation might only be induced by Vpu or alternatively it might exist as a physiologically functional state that Vpu selectively uses to its advantage. the complexity of these trafficking and degradation mechanisms may have prevented a clear identification of the AP complex(es) responsible for the Vpu-activity in previous studies. neither AP1, 2 or 3 knockdown in 293T cells and HeLa cells nor AP1 knockout in mouse fibroblasts had any apparent effects on the ability of Vpu to antagonize restriction by BST2. a shared feature of retroviral accessory proteins including Vpu, Nef, Vif, Vpr and Vpx is the presence of long and flexible loops. these unstructured regions can adopt different conformations to facilitate binding to different host target proteins. these regions often harbor motifs mimicking functional host sequences, enabling the virus to hijack the desired host machineries. Vpu induced downregulation of NTB-A enables infected cells to evade lysis by NK cells. this involves the mistrafficking of NTB-A, which phenotypically resembles Vpu-mediated BST2 mistrafficking. the interaction with AP1 allows BST2 that is internalized from the cell surface to recycle to the plasma membrane. this signaling function could occur from an endosomal compartment that BST2 reaches via AP1-dependent trafficking. this signaling function could occur from an endosomal compartment that BST2 reaches via AP1-dependent trafficking. encoding gene was cloned into pMAT9s expression vector containing a N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by the maltose binding protein (MBP) and a pCDFDuet vector encoding both the and subunits of the casein kinase II (CK2) were co-transformed into the E. coli NiCo21(DE3) competent cells. 6xHis-MBP-VpuCD (phosphorylated) and 6xHis-MBP-BST2CD were expressed and purified similarly for the AP1 core used in the crystallization. the genes encoding residues 1-613 of mouse and 1-158 of human 1 were subcloned into the pETDuet vector. the hemicomplex of AP2, 398-, was created by subcloning the rat into the pMAT9s expression vector. the heterodimer was expressed similarly as the BST2CD-VpuCD fusion above and was purified sequentially on a Ni-NTA affinity column. the crystals were in the P43 space group and diffracted to a highest resolution of 3.0. the data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. data sharpening was performed to enhance the details in the electron density map. the final model has an Rwork/Rfree of 0.18/0.22. the refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. eluted proteins were analyzed on SDS PAGE stained with Coomassie blue. eluted proteins were then eluted with 5 0.1 ml GST elution buffer.
