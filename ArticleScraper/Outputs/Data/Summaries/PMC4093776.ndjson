{"summary": "some reports indicate that Lassa virus (LASV) infects up to 300 000 people leading to 5000 deaths each year. other reports indicate as many 2 million infected individuals resulting in 5000\u201310 000 deaths annually. at present, no vaccine is available for the prevention of Lassa HF, and treatment options are extremely limited. the large (L) RNA segment encodes the L RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in a negative-sense orientation. the L polymerase is responsible for transcribing viral mRNAs as well as replicating the genome. domain III of the L polymerase contains the RdRp domain (Vieth et al., 2004) the cellular protease subtilisin kexin isozyme-1(SKI-1)/site 1 protease (S1P) remains associated with GP2. these structures trimerize to form a functional glycoprotein. both segments have 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) with complementarity. the family Arenaviridae is classified into two groups: the NW and the OW arenaviruses. this distinction is based on geographical distribution and serological relatedness, as well as phylogeny. the OW arenaviruses that have potential to cause human diseases include LASV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and LUJV. over 5 % of people show evidence of previous exposure, 1 % mortality Lassa virus West Africa Mastomys natalensis (multimammate rat) Approximately 2 million infections annually and between 5000\u201310 000 deaths Lujo virus South Africa Unknown Five identified cases, four fatal New World Junn virus Argentina Calomys musculinus (drylands vesper mouse) 300\u20131000 cases year1 before vaccine, 30\u201350 cases year1 after introduction of vaccine. new world arenaviruses are divided into clades A, B and C, as well as the A/rec recombinant lineage. the south american arenaviruses cause diseases in humans. MACV, Sabia virus (SABV) and Chapare virus (CHPV) are responsible for causing human HF in Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil and Bolivia. only one naturally occurring case each has been reported for SABV and CHPV infections. LCMV infection is serious for immunocompromised individuals. four cases have been reported of LCMV infection resulting from organ transplant. 11 of these cases proved fatal, highlighting the pathogenic potential for OW arenavirus. MACV infections have surfaced sporadically in the form of outbreaks. from 1962 to 1964, there were 1000 reported cases. over 200 cases of MACV infection were reported in 2007\u20132008. mortality rate is high at 20 %, and warrants development of vaccines. Lassa fever infections can result in pharyngitis, retrosternal pain, proteinuria, sore throat, mucosal bleeding, deafness, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, malaise, headache, nausea, diarrhoea and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 15 % of Lassa patients suffer from sensorineural deafness. LUJV has only recently been discovered and only five cases identified. patients suffering from LUJV infection are reported to experience diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, chest pain, sore throat, rash, myalgia, facial swelling. severe bleeding was observed in three of the five patients. despite only five cases, four of these resulted in death. OW arenavirus-induced HFs are most serious in terms of humans. a wide range of symptoms may be exhibited by individuals infected even with the same arenavirus. some patients may experience very mild disease, while others present with severe HF. the cause of death from arenaviral HF is not well understood. viraemia is a good indicator of disease prognosis for individuals infected with LASV. endogenous levels of IFN- are indicative of disease outcome. haemorrhage, neurological changes, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are much more common in JUNV-infected patients. only a small percentage of patients develop haemorrhage. this haemorrhage is limited primarily to mucosal surfaces. the amount of blood loss and pathological lesions are not sufficient to account for the terminal shock and death that follows in lethal cases. the mechanism for increased permeability of the vascular endothelium has yet to be determined but is most likely due to virus infection of this tissue. this, in combination with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, may be the cause of shock, leading ultimately to death. in other viral HFs, such as dengue and Ebola, a cytokine storm interferes with the integrity of the vascular endothelium. the receptor for JUNV, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), is highly expressed on vascular endothelial cells. this virus is not cytopathic, vascular lesions are not observed in vivo. experimentally infected endothelial cells show an increase in nitric oxide and prostaglandin PGI2 production. infected individuals also exhibit thrombocytopenia and reduced complement activity. the coagulation activity of blood in infected patients is also low. differences in immune responses are noted between NW and OW arenavirus infections that play a critical role in clearance of the virus. macrophages and DCs are readily infected with LASV. however, they fail to become activated upon infection. a closely related virus, MOPV, is apathogenic in humans. DCs infected with LASV in a co-culture model remained inactive. activation of the APCs is critical for generating effective T-cell response. the exact role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AHF has yet to be determined. the exact role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AHF has yet to be determined. a delayed response could contribute to pathogenesis, as seen in patients with severe disease and high levels of cytokines. treatment in this later stage of illness did lower viral titres and endogenous IFN levels whilst prolonging the time to death but failed to reduce mortality. diagnosis of arenaviral HF presents challenges because of the wide spectrum of symptoms displayed by infected patients. the most severe pathology is found in the liver, lung and adrenal gland. ions are found in the liver, lung and adrenal gland. none of the pathological lesions found are severe enough to account for the cause of death. arenaviruses can cause HF in humans, but the capacity for different arenaviruses to result in haemorrhage or coagulopathy differs among viruses. only a small percentage of patients develop haemorrhage, and this haemorrhage is limited primarily to mucosal surfaces. autopsies on LASV-infected patients and experimentally infected non-human primates fail to reveal vascular lesions. mechanism for increased permeability of the vascular endothelium has yet to be determined. this, in combination with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, may be the cause of shock, leading ultimately to death. haemorrhage is not a common feature of LASV-infected patients. the release of inflammatory mediators does not appear to be the cause of increased vascular permeability. vascular damage is limited as seen with LASV infection. discrepancy suggests VWF is originating from some other source rather than endothelial cells. an as-yet-unknown inhibitor of platelet aggregation exists in plasma. infected individuals also exhibit thrombocytopenia and reduced complement activity. a closely related virus, MOPV, is apathogenic in humans. a closely related virus, MOPV, can actually provide protection against LASV infection in non-human primates. DCs and T-cells were activated upon virus infection. this has been speculated to be the effect of cross-talk with T-cells. the activation of the APCs is critical for generating effective T-cell response. in vitro-infected macrophages show no increase in cytokine production. the exact role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AHF has yet to be determined. the exact role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AHF has yet to be determined. a late neurological syndrome has been observed in 10 % of patients treated with immune plasma. treatment in this later stage of illness did lower viral titres and endogenous IFN levels whilst prolonging the time to death. DG binds laminin, a component of the extracellular matrix, while the transmembrane portion of the receptor, DG, anchors the receptor by binding dystrophin in the cytoplasm. the disturbance of the membrane could result in an interference with cellular signalling, which may also contribute to HF disease pathogenesis. 3 million human polymorphisms have identified positive selection of two genes. Dystrophin is a cytosolic adaptor protein necessary for DG to function properly. over 21 % of individuals showed evidence of exposure to LASV infection. this may alter the ability of LASV GP to bind DG. the NW arenaviruses that are responsible for human disease gain cellular entry by binding human TfR1. the normal function of this receptor is to mediate endocytosis of iron-bound transferrin, thereby transporting iron across the cell membrane and allowing its subsequent release into the cytoplasm. the specificity for the human homologue of TfR1 appears to be an important determinant of pathogenesis. mutations that confer protection against infection do so at some cost to the host. OW and NW arenaviruses use different cellular receptors for entry into host cells. they also use different routes of intracellular trafficking as part of this entry process. the virus subverts classical routes of endosomal trafficking and bypasses the early endosome. this compartment contains the toll-like receptors responsible for detection of RNA viruses. this may explain the observed failure of the innate immune system to detect LASV infection. pathological arenavirus infections by both NW and OW arenaviruses are characterized by the ability of viral proteins to inhibit type I IFN. the NP proteins of OW LASV and LCMV as well as NW JUNV, MACV, White Water Arroyo virus, TCRV and LATV have all been shown to display this ability to inhibit type I IFN. the viral Z protein appears to play a similar role in inhibiting IFN production. the viral Z proteins of NW arenaviruses JUNV, GTOV, MACV and SABV bind to RIG-I. DG binds laminin, a component of the extracellular matrix, while the transmembrane portion of the receptor, DG, anchors the receptor by binding dystrophin in the cytoplasm. when LASV infection occurs, laminin is displaced by the effect of binding of the virus to DG. dystrophin is a cytosolic adaptor protein necessary for DG to function properly. over 21 % of individuals showed evidence of exposure to LASV infection. addition of laminin has been found to be incapable of blocking LASV GP-mediated infection of Vero cells. this suggests that the virus can infect cells through the use of alternative receptors. the NW arenaviruses that are responsible for human disease gain cellular entry by binding human TfR1. the normal function of this receptor is to mediate endocytosis of iron-bound transferrin, thereby transporting iron across the cell membrane and allowing its subsequent release into the cytoplasm. the specificity for the human homologue of TfR1 appears to be an important determinant of pathogenesis. OW and NW arenaviruses use different cellular receptors for entry into host cells. they also use different routes of intracellular trafficking as part of this entry process. the virus\u2013receptor complex is then delivered via the multivesicular body. this process is dependent on microtubular transport. OW arenavirus internalization is independent of clathrin. it involves internalization via clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. cholesterol sequestration has only a minor effect on JUNV infection. pathological arenavirus infections by both NW and OW arenaviruses are characterized by the ability of viral proteins to inhibit type I IFN. the NP proteins of OW LASV and LCMV as well as NW JUNV, MACV, White Water Arroyo virus, TCRV and LATV have all been shown to display this ability to inhibit type I IFN. retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) have also been implicated in binding of the NP protein to IB kinase, thereby inhibiting the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-B. the viral Z protein appears to play a similar role in inhibiting IFN production. studies in humanized mice confirm need for cell-mediated immune defence against LASV. mice could be protected from disease through T-cell depletion. if host response proves incapable of doing so, disease becomes mediated by the same cells that would otherwise protect against it. multivalent vaccine would protect against different strains and potentially species of OW arenaviruses. a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine has also been developed. a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine expressing LASV GPC has also been found to be protective in non-human primates. a reverse genetics system has been developed for Candid #1. it has provided much-needed insight into the molecular determinants of attenuation for the vaccine strain. a single residue change, F427I, appears to be responsible for the attenuated phenotype. this may affect viral fusion or maturation. arenaviruses share many characteristics, such as genome structure, viral assembly, natural host reservoirs and interference with immune responses. differences in signs and symptoms do exist between the viruses. arenaviruses are pathogens of significant human morbidity and mortality. NW and OW arenaviruses appear to take an extra step to ensure evasion of host immune detection through the use of the viral Z protein. recent studies have also provided intriguing evidence for evolution of certain host genes that can potentially provide natural protection from pathogenic NW and OW arenavirus infections."}
