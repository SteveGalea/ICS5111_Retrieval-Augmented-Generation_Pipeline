{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome is a serious respiratory illness caused by a novel variant of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1]\u2013[8]. studying the long-term changes in humoral and CTL responses in recovered patients will not only verify earlier findings but further establish correlates of protection to be generated by future vaccine candidates. blood samples were obtained from 70 normal healthy age matched individuals. the average age for these individuals is 3910 with 36 being male and 34 female. the average age for these individuals is 3910 with 36 are being male and 34 female. the mean absolute numbers for total lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8 T lymphocytes, and NK cells at 24 months after the onset of symptom remained statistically different from that in normal healthy controls. this finding suggests that complete restoration of peripheral lymphocyte may require a longer period or peripheral lymphocyte reduction in SARS patients is permanent despite recovery from clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV infection. antibodies against N protein were detectable throughout the entire period of study. within the first 6 month after onset of symptom, N protein-specific antibody remained relatively high. the same trend of changes in N protein-specific antibodies was also observed for experiments with 1/900 dilution. both dilutions were used to carry out experiments presented in (B) and (C) the only 100-fold diluted serum were used for experiments presented in (A) the top and bottom of each rectangular box denote the 75th and 25th percentiles. four peptide pools, namely NX4, NX6, NY6, and NY7, were found to be preferentially recognized by recovered SARS patients. Fig. 3B summarizes results for all the samples tested and found that there are potential two major CTL epitopes in the N protein. each rectangular box denotes the 75th and 25th percentiles. an arbitrary line was drawn at 3000 SFC per million PBMC. the actual composition and cross-broad layout of each peptide pools derived from the N protein (upper panel) dr14 2.13 A203 2.08 B58 6.52 DR15 12.77 B60 15.22 DR16 4.26 B61 4.35 DR17 2.13 B62 8.70 B67 2.17 B75 4.35 B81 2.17 B3901 2.17 B5102 2.17 Discussion In this report, we have extended our early study by sequentially monitoring 30 recovered SARS patients over a 2-year period to characterize temporal changes in humoral and CTL responses against SARS-CoV. the average age of these patients was 3711 with 13 are being male and 17 female. blood samples were also obtained from 70 normal healthy age matched individuals. the average age for these individuals is 3910 with 36 are being male and 34 female. the average age of these patients was 3711 with 13 are being male and 17 female. blood samples were also obtained from 70 normal healthy age matched individuals. the average age for these individuals is 3910 with 36 are being male and 34 female."}
