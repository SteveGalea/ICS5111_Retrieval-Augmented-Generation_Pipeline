{"summary": "a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid in the treatment of acute expiratory wheezing in children. from September 1, 2000, through May 31, 2002, a total of 293 children participated in the study in the department of pediatrics, Turku University Hospital. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital. ile cotton swabs were placed in vials containing 2 mL of viral transport medium. the rest of the mucus was used for virus antigen detection. blood samples were collected 2\u20133 weeks after discharge from hospital. RT-PCR was used to detect enteroviruses and rhinovirus, coronavirus, RSV, and HMPV. a case was defined as virus positive if at least one of the tests used was positive for virus. bronchiolitis and asthma are expressions of the same pathologic process. bronchiolitis and asthma are expressions of the same pathologic process. purified heat-treated coxsackievirus A9, coxsackievirus B3, echovirus 11 and poliovirus 1 were used as an antigen mixture in enterovirus IgG assays. purified heat-treated coxsackievirus A16, coxsackievirus B3, and echovirus 11 were used as an antigen mixture in enterovirus IgG assays. a total of 661 children were hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing 79 were 3 months of age, 55 were not enrolled during study breaks, 24 did not need hospitalization, 17 had a chronic disease, 12 had guardians with language difficulties, 11 needed treatment in our intensive care unit, 2 had guardians who were not present, 2 patients' cases were not reported to the study physician. the remaining 320 were eligible, but the parents of 27 (8%) children did not give their consent for participation. accounted for 18% of the cases, and none of these viruses was detected in >5% of all cases. mixed viral infections were found in 57 (19%) cases. most of the viruses (84%), respiratory picornaviruses especially, were detected by using PCR (Table 1). Rhinovirus was cultivated in 25 (38%) of 65 specimens with PCR-positive results, enteroviruses in 14 (24%) of 59 specimens with PCR-positive results, and rhino/enterovirus in 1 (2%) of 46 specimens with PCR-positive results. respiratory picornaviruses were detected in 65% and RSV in 22% of cases in children ages 12\u201335 months. in children aged >3 years, respiratory picornaviruses (82%) were found most frequently. study, 79 were 3 months of age, 55 were not enrolled during study breaks, 24 did not need hospitalization, 17 had a chronic disease, 12 had guardians with language difficulties, 11 needed treatment in our intensive care unit, 2 had guardians who were not present, 2 patients' cases were not reported to the study physician. the remaining 320 were eligible, but the parents of 27 (8%) children did not give their consent for participation. negative viral findings in 293 children hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezinga. n = 293 Virus culture;b n = 292 Virus serology;b n = 291 Virus serology;b n = 291 Virus serology;b n = 291 Virus serology;b n = 291 Virus serology;b n = 293 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 62 (21) 58 (20) 50 (18 most of the viruses (84%), respiratory picornaviruses especially, were detected by using PCR (Table 1). Rhinovirus was cultivated in 25 (38%) of 65 specimens with PCR-positive results, enteroviruses in 14 (24%) of 59 specimens with PCR-positive results, and rhino/enterovirus in 1 (2%) of 46 specimens with PCR-positive results. respiratory picornaviruses were detected in 65% and RSV in 22% of cases in children ages 12\u201335 months. in children aged >3 years, respiratory picornaviruses were found most frequently. adenovirus infected children ages 1\u20132 years significantly more often. all major studies of the viral origins of expiratory wheezing are presented in Table 2. viral diagnosis was based on conventional virus culture, antigen detection, and serologic testing. a viral agent could be established in 20% to 50% of children with expiratory wheezing. 267 1\u201312 + 4 6 1 1 1 3 14 1979 (21) 1,851 0\u201315 + 7 1 6 2 21 1979 (22) 554 0\u201312 + 2 13 4 4 2 1 26 1979 (23) 72 5\u201315 + 1 28 3 10 1 49 1984 (24) 256 2\u201315 + + 5 4 2 3 2 29 1987 (25) 204 0\u201312 + + 6 1 5 0 3 2 19 1993 (26) 99 0.2\u201316 + + 14 19 3 0 2 0 a recent study of children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract disease found HMPV in 6% of the cases (34). bronchiolitis and pneumonitis were the main diagnoses. the HMPV outbreak with 10 cases was seen during the first study year. the respiratory virus season is the main factor determining the viral cause of acute illness, but any seasonality bias is excluded. acute expiratory wheezing necessitating hospitalization was most often associated with RSV, enterovirus and rhinovirus infections."}
