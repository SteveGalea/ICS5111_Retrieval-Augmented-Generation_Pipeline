{"summary": "84 calves were modeled between 0\u20132 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. a 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. the management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations. total pre-weaning costs ranged from $258.56 to $582.98 per calf across all management scenarios and milk allotments. increased fertility and increased use of sexed semen have made replacement heifers more available for dairy operations. a 2014 survey of 2545 heifer calves in the united states found individual housing was the dominant form of housing pre-weaned heifers. the average cost of producers utilizing individual housing was $363.69 ($195.06, $530.76) and those with group housing was $401.58 ($138.39, $585.52), a difference in average cost of $37.89 per calf, but with a difference range of over $300 for individual and $400 for group housing cost simulation model was developed at the University of Kentucky Dairy Science program in 2018. the base herd used included 1500 milking cows, 1000 replacement heifers in total and 84 heifer calves in the pre-weaning period. the model required a management decision at 3 points: housing type, milk source, and labor. barn cost was derived from the Dairy Calf and Heifer Association gold standard recommendation of 3.3 M2 per calf. replacement heifers were assumed to require 3.7 M2 per calf. construction cost [11] varied based on the infrastructure required for each situation. rrhea prevalence 21.4% Urie, 2018 Respiratory illness prevalence 12.7% Urie, 2018 Pre-weaning mortality rate 5% NAHMS, 2011 Water cost per calf pre-weaning $0.50 Based on water price Jan. 2019 Bedding per calf pre-weaning $11.00 Heinrichs, 2013 Weaning Age 65 days Adkins, 2017 Barn cost per heifer (BC) was calculated using the payment function in excel with 7% interest, 20 years useful life allotment can increase average daily gain (ADG) pre-weaning, result in larger skeletal measurements at weaning, and decrease vocalizations caused by milk deprivation. milk allotment was decreased by 50% until day 50, where allotment was decreased daily by 20% until weaned. birth weight and weaning weight were a result of milk allotted and calf starter intake per calf following experimental data from Rosenberger et al. 2017. Average daily gain (ADG) followed the equation presented in NRC 2001. the cost of the feeder was assumed at $15,000 value, 10 years useful life and $200.00 annual maintenance. Equation (3) represents the calculation of daily feeder cost per calf using the payment (PMT) function in excel. 10,000 simulations of the model were performed for each of the situations. based on the selected prevalence, there was a direct relationship to the additional treatment cost for each calf.

Labor Labor to care for calves and the number of employees working were adapted from published surveys of producers employing individual and group housing. calf mortality was added as an additional cost to each remaining calf. the total health cost was figured at $9.22 per calf. the prevalence of respiratory illness and diarrhea was determined. all variables were modeled following a Pert distribution set with minimum, most likely, and maximum value. assumptions were made based on published literature, surveys, and market assumptions were also used to calculate the total cost. milk source milk allotment (L) assumed the same nutritional value and gain from milk replacer and whole milk, creating a limitation in the model. but calves fed pasteurized or unpasteurized whole milk have been shown to increase model-produced ADG by at least 0.03 kg/day with the potential to be over 0.25 kg/day of gain. 0.3 0.3\u20130.6 0.6\u20130.9 0.9\u20131.2 Milk Replacer $3.50 $2.75 $2.68 $2.67 Pasteurized Whole Milk $3.60 $3.45 $3.31 $2.90 Whole Milk $2.98 $2.96 $2.92 $2.60 3.3. Labor The labor decisions depend on the housing system selected. hourly wages for management are higher than those for paid employees. the average cost per calf was $0.70 7.33 per calf. preventative health costs added an additional $9.22 to each calf. mortality rate increased by 2%, 8%, 10%, and 15%. management practices specific to a housing type can change illness prevalence. for example, calves housed in groups of 12\u201318 had a higher incidence of respiratory illness and lower daily gains than calves housed in groups of 6\u20139 [9]. $323.38 $16.86 $306.30 $455.82 $351.22 $16.92 $333.56 $484.19 $379.06 $16.99 $360.82 $512.57 Whole Milk-Conventional $274.63 $16.77 $258.56 $406.13 $302.47 $16.82 $285.82 $434.51 $330.30 $16.88 $313.08 $462.88 $358.14 $16.94 $340.34 $491.25 Individual Housing Inside Milk the most expensive management style was the one utilizing individual housing outside, feeding whole milk with conventional labor. the main difference in cost can be attributed to the larger infrastructure needs for group housing and the additional cost of a pasteurizer. variation in health and mortality rates is not always related to efficiency on-farm. housing cost contributed 7\u20138% of the total cost compared to other management pathways utilizing more infrastructure. the addition of barns with individual housing inside and in group housing was the contribution of the additional 14\u201323% of the total cost. bedding was the largest contributing cost per calf for individual housing outside. hutch/barn infrastructure, bedding and, water and electric on total housing cost per housing management decision. group-housed calves on milk replacer with an automatic feeder will cost $3.50 per kg of gain. the minimum decrease in cost was from feeding 10 L to 12 L of milk replacer at $0.01 difference per kg of gain. the maximum savings per kg of gain was $0.41 increasing from 10 to 12 L of pasteurized whole milk. decreased from inside individual housing to group housing by 36% per calf for a value of 2.4 minutes or $0.50 per calf per day. this shows a reduction in overall labor cost but an increased demand for fixed and variable expenses. these include the paying for the feeder, annual maintenance and a barn to house calves. 44 $319.87 Pasteurized Whole Milk-Conventional $291.27 $307.26 $313.06 $328.75 Whole Milk-Conventional $287.98 $303.85 $309.61 $325.20 Individual Housing Inside Milk Replacer-Conventional $303.03 $319.40 $325.34 $341.42 Pasteurized Whole Milk-Conventional $311.28 $327.92 $333.96 $350.30 Whole Milk-Conventional $307.98 $324.51 $330 variables included health-related expenses, mortality, and utilities for electricity and water. feed represented the largest factor in all management scenarios, followed by labor, then variable and fixed costs. $376.30 $16.98 $358.12 $509.76 $404.13 $17.04 $385.39 $538.13 Whole Milk-Conventional $299.71 $16.81 $283.12 $431.70 $327.55 $16.87 $310.38 $460.07 $355.38 $16.93 $337.64 $488.44 $383.22 $16.99 $364.90 $516.81 Group Housing Milk Replacer-Conventional $345.11 $16.91 $3 the most expensive management style was the one utilizing individual housing outside, feeding whole milk with conventional labor. the main difference in cost can be attributed to the larger infrastructure needs for group housing and the additional cost of a pasteurizer. the cost per day of fixed and variable costs matches our model, $2.05\u2013$8.73 for minimum and maximum daily cost [8]. this simulation model can be compared to surveys to validate the results are reflective of on-farm total values."}
