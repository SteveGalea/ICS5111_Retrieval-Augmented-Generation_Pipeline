{"summary": "a patient with bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral heads presented with a primary symptom of low back pain. a 37-year-old male presented for evaluation of dominant pain that existed for approximately 6\u201312 months and was located in the right low back. Milder pain was also reported in the right hip. patients with pathology identified only in the hip region in 2.5% of cases. 20,000 new cases of hip ON are diagnosed each year in the united states alone27,28 and up to 60% occur bilaterally29. no traumatic incident or injury was reported prior to symptom onset. at exam, his most severe pain was located over the right posterior iliac crest. both the low back and hip pain were sharp in quality and exhibited varying intensity. thigh thrust, sacral thrust, iliac compression, anterior superior iliac spine compression, and the lumbar extension-rotation test did not reproduce pain. only 3 examination maneuvers mildly reproduced the patient\u2019s LBP. no examination procedures produced pain in the left hip. radiographic examination revealed a slight left lumbar convexity without notable degenerative change in the lumbar spine or sacroiliac joints. the left femoral head showed a mild loss of sphericity, indicating early cortical collapse. a 37-year-old man with a varied work history reported LBP. no traumatic incident or injury was reported prior to symptom onset. at exam, his most severe pain was located over the right posterior iliac crest. thigh thrust, sacral thrust, iliac compression, anterior superior iliac spine compression, and the lumbar extension-rotation test did not reproduce pain. tibialis anterior, extensor hallicus longus and peroneus were normally symmetrical. radiographic examination of the lumbar spine and pelvis revealed a slight left lumbar convexity without notable degenerative change in the lumbar spine or sacroiliac joints. the left femoral head showed a mild loss of sphericity, indicating early cortical collapse. the patient had not undergone corrective surgery due to an elective decision to postpone. radiographic imaging showed bilateral ON with the left hip showing greater structural deterioration despite normal examination findings and the absence of symptoms on that side. more than 90% of non-traumatic hip ON cases are estimated to occur secondary to alcohol and corticosteroid use54. the causal relationships between ON and alcohol and corticosteroid use is unclear because it is difficult to separate pharmacologic side-effects from underlying disease. two surgical procedures designed to prevent collapse and stimulate regrowth are core decompression and vascularized bone grafts. no clear evidence points to either procedure as most appropriate or predictive of outcomes also appears mixed. radiographic imaging findings associated with Ficat-Arlet stages of osteonecrosis of the hip are likely the only treatment option that will allow patients to remain ambulatory in the long-term. a patient with bilateral hip ON may contribute to atypical LBP via referred pain or altered biomechanical loading of pelvic and low back tissues. the case demonstrates the value of performing an evidenced-based diagnostic investigation for patients with LBP."}
