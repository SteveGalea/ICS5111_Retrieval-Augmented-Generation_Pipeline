{"summary": "a suspected case-patient with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia was classified as a probable case-patient. a suspected case-patient with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest x-ray was considered a probable case-patient (8). 5 L of RNA extract was used as the template in all PCR assays in 50-L reaction volumes containing 10 L of 5X buffer, 2 L enzyme mix, 2 L deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) the reaction was subjected to precycle condition at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, and 95\u00b0C for 15 min. forty cycles of amplification were then conducted at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 100 L of vero E6 cells (2.5 x 105/L) were added to each well of the plate. the titer of antibody was calculated as the highest dilution that CPE was completely inhibited on the well. the neutralization test was carried out with each sample in duplicate. 10 L of 1:100 diluted antihuman gamma globulins labeled with FITC (Zymed) was added onto each well. slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope. a sample with an antibody titer of 1:100 is positive. a sample is positive if its adjusted optical density (OD of test \u2013 OD of control) exceeds the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the normal controls and its titer is >1:400. the antigen used in this test is a recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV. a positive result will gradually appear on the test line and become visible by naked eye. the upper one is the control line, which indicates that the serum sample contains SARS-CoV antibodies. if red is found only at the test line or no lines are visible, the test is invalid. a suspected case-patient with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest x-ray was considered a probable case-patient (8). a suspected case-patient with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest x-ray was considered a probable case-patient. the reaction was subjected to precycle condition at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, and 95\u00b0C for 15 min. for real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays, a 20-L reaction volumes containing 12 L of HPA-Coronavirus LC Master mix, 3 L of HPA-Coronavirus LC Mg-Sol, and 0.5 L of HPA-Coronavirus LC internal control were thermal-cycled. the titer of antibody was calculated as the highest dilution that CPE was completely inhibited on the well. positive control serum specimens were taken from patients with confirmed SARS in Taiwan. negative control serum specimens were from healthy volunteers. a sample with an antibody titer of 1:100 is positive. if nonspecific reactivity to both infected and uninfected cells were detected, the test was considered un-interpretable. a sample is positive if its adjusted optical density (OD of test \u2013 OD of control) exceeds the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the normal controls and its titer is >1:400. the antigen used in this test is a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV were gel purified and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector. the constructs were then transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells. the recombinant proteins were bound by BD TALON metal affinity resins. RT-PCR detected positive results in 32% of patients with suspected cases. the positive rates reached a peak of 50% to 60% on day 7 to day 10. however in a few specimens, virus RNA was still detected on day 18, day 20, and day 38 after illness onset. antibodies against SARS-CoV developed in most at the late convalescent stage. positive rate of antibodies was raised to 50% at 3 weeks after illness onset. overall antibody-positive rate was 54.2% (254/469) these 35 specimens were taken from 31 patients, in which two positive PCR results were found. the measurements of specificity were all 100% for the neutralization test, ELISA, ELISA, and ICT.

RT-PCR detected positive results in 32% of patients with suspected cases. positive rates reached a peak of 50% to 60% on day 7 to day 10. however in a few specimens, virus RNA was still detected on day 18, day 20, and day 38 after illness onset. antibodies against SARS-CoV developed in most at the late convalescent stage. positive rate of antibodies to SARS-CoV was raised to 50% at 3 weeks after illness onset. overall antibody-positive rate was 54.2% (254/469) ELISA, 30 positive with IFA, and 2 positive with ICT tests. these 35 specimens were taken from 31 patients, in which two positive PCR results were found. the measurements of specificity were all 100% for the neutralization test, ELISA, ELISA, and ICT. 0 100% 0 100% Adenovirus Total Ab 1 0 1 0 100% 0 100% Influenza B virus Total Ab 1 0 1 0 100% 0 100% 0 100% Hantavirus Total Ab 1 0 1 0 100% 0 100% 0 100% Chlamydia pneumoniae IgM 4 0 4 0 100% 0 100% 0 100% Streptococcus pneumoniae Total Ab 1 0 1 0 100% 0 100% 0 100% Total non-SARS path RT-PCR positive 145 108 37 52.2% 74.5% Negative 236 99 137 78.7% 58.1% Laboratory Confirmation Rate for Probable SARS Case-Patients Table 5 shows the laboratory confirmation rate of probable SARS cases in Taiwan. neutralization tests, ELISA, and IFA are based on whole viral extracts of SARS-CoV. recombinant proteins carrying epitopes can be produced on a large scale and with an acceptable degree of purity. ninety-five serum samples were used in this comparison. ELISA results were highly correlated with results from the neutralization test. in the case of IFA, both the sensitivity and negative predictive value levels were above 99%; however, the specificity of 87.8% implies that IFA may cause false-positive problems. a weak positive IFA result should be retested by a neutralization test or ELISA. no positive results were found by any of the IFA, ELISA, and neutralization test. another 95 samples from the ruled-out category had been tested with ELISA. however, no positive results were found by any of the neutralization test. patients were reclassified as probable SARS patients by the center for disease control-Taiwan. the positive rate of antibodies to SARS-CoV in probable SARS patients in Taiwan was increased to 86.6% (227/262), by using the serum samples on day 28 or beyond after the onset of illness. samples from the remaining 322 cases may have to be tested for other pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and human metapneu"}
