{"summary": "a calf (female, 84 days old) showed anorexia, pyrexia and diarrhea. despite treatment with antibiotics (kanamycin and tylosin), sulfamonomethoxine and antipyretic, the calf died 20 days after the onset of diarrhea. 0.5 ml of MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to each well. cells were frozen and thawed once and then centrifuged. cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 5 program. the reliability of the branch was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates. cell lysates were electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE. they were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) after blocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% gelatin (EIA Grade Reagent Gelatin; Bio-Rad, CA, U.S.A.) paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 2 m and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. sections were also used for immunohistochemical detection of antigens. sections were rinsed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min. two isolates (22\u201358 and 24\u2013100) were PCR positive when genus-specific and species-specific omp1 genes of C. pecorum were targeted. omp1 gene partial sequence of the 2 isolates was 100% identical. nucleotide similarities of the omp1 gene between the isolates and other published C. pecorum isolates were 89.2%, 85.2% and 82.0% for Bo/Maeda strain which was isolated from cattle with pneumonia in Japan. 66P130 strain which was isolated from sheep with enteritis in united states, respectively. sequence of reference strains obtained from GenBank. AB284064 was used as an outgroup to root the tree. nucleotide sequence identities (%) of omp1 genes among C. pecorum strains. cross-reactivity among C. pecorum strains determined by neutralization test. paired sera of case 2: a significant increase in antibody against 24\u2013100 strain was confirmed by neutralizing tests using paired sera. multiple hemorrhages were observed in the cecum and colon. positive reactions were observed in the jejunal villi. positive reactions were observed by immunohistochemical staining. mydial infection was associated with reduced serum iron concentrations and lower hematocrit values, and infected calves were leukopenic [17]. persistence of C. pecorum strains in the intestines and vaginal mucus of ruminants could cause long-term sub-clinical infection. this may explain the poor weight gain observed in case 2 after recovery from diarrhea. corum isolates similar to Bo/Yokohama might be endemic in Yamaguchi Prefecture."}
