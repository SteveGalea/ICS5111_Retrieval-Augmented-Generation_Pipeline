{"summary": "the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family contains more than 70 viruses including medically important dengue virus (DENV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), west Nile virus (WNV), Yellow fever virus (YFV) and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) it is responsible for frequent epidemics of encephalitis in humans in most parts of Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and India. the 3\u2032-NCR is predicted to form a stable stem loop (SL) these sequences adopt a secondary structure of similar size, shape and predicted thermodynamic stability. conservation of RNA structures and their location among flaviviruses suggest their possible functional relevance in viral replication [5], [6]. polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) with dengue virus genome [13]\u2013[15] was required for efficient viral replication. a growing list of host proteins being identified to negatively regulate viral replication. hepatitis C virus (HCV) and picornaviruses involved in IRES-mediated translation initiation [23]\u2013[22]. pJE5NCR and pJE3SL cloned under control of bacteriophage T7 promoter. pJE5NCR had JEV 5\u2032-NCR sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1\u201395. pJE3SL had 3\u2032-SL cDNA in ApaI-XbaI sites. pJE3NCR was linearized with XbaI. pJE3SL and pJE3NCR were linearized with XbaI. RNA yield was determined by the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. Purification of recombinant proteins E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression vector pET28a-PTB (a generous gift from Dr. J.G. Patton) and pET28a-NS5 (a generous gift from Dr. R. Chang) the expression of his-tagged recombinant PTB or JEV NS5 was induced by 1 mM IPTG. the gels were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 15 min in a 20 ml reaction with 100 fmol 32P-labelled RNA in binding buffer (14 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 60 mM KCl) the reaction products were loaded onto nitrocellulose filters (HAWP 02500; Millipore) pre-equilibrated with 2 ml binding buffer, and filtered under vacuum the samples were electrophoresed on a discontinuous 6% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-PAGE. the gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid, dried and autoradiographed. RNA Co-immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Co-IP RT-PCR) reaction tubes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. beads were then washed thoroughly with ice-cold buffer B. resuspended in 100 l buffer B supplemented with 0.5% SDS. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) cell washed again with 1% BSA and overlaid with mounting medium containing DAPI (Invitrogen) to stain the nucleus. plasmid encoding PTB shRNA was used for down-regulating the PTB level by targeted gene silencing in cultured cells. iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used for cDNA synthesis using primers specific for JEV positive (5\u2032-AATAGGTTGTAGTTGGGCACTCTG-3\u2032) and negative strand RNA (5\u2032-AGAGCACCAAGGGAAATAGT-3\u2032) the 18S ribosomal RNA was quantified using the following primers for normalizing the RNA amounts. pJE5NCR and pJE3SL were cloned under control of bacteriophage T7 promoter. pJE5NCR had JEV 5\u2032-NCR sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1\u201395. pJE3SL had JEV 3\u2032-NCR sequence corresponding to nucleotides 10891\u201310976 of JEV plus-strand genome. the reaction product was treated with 10 U RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. the transcript was then treated with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 20 l RNase-free water. aliquots were snap frozen and stored at 70\u00b0C. the RNA-protein complexes were resolved by non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide: bisacrylamide 50: 1) containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5X TBE buffer (45 mM Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA) at 4\u00b0C. the gels were autoradiographed after drying. binding reaction mixture was transferred to an ice bath and irradiated with 254-nm UV lamp (4 Watts) the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to digest the unprotected RNA. the UV cross-linked products were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. beads were treated with buffer B (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) the reaction tubes were incubated on an end-to-end rotor overnight at 4\u00b0C. RNA pellet resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. cells were fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin. cells were incubated with rabbit anti-goat Cy5 (Invitrogen) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies. cells were washed again with 1% BSA and overlaid with mounting medium containing DAPI (Invitrogen) for PTB overexpression, cells were transfected with pcPTB. pcDNA 3.1(-) vector was used as a negative control. levels of PTB in transfected cells were measured by immunoblotting the cell lysate with PTB antibody. genomic RNA - 5NCR(+) and the complementary sequence in the antigenome - 3NCR(-) were stable even in the presence of as high as 300 mM KCl in the binding reaction. the radiolabelled complex formation was inhibited when increasing amounts of corresponding cold RNA was added to the binding reaction. we also tested binding of PTB to 3SL(+) RNA as a negative control. nM for the 3NCR(-) RNA was strong and specific. the protein had higher affinity to 3NCR(-) RNA compared to 5NCR(+) RNA. RT-PCR of the precipitated RNA is expected to yield a 397-bp product. anti-dsRNA antibodies have been widely used to localize the flavivirus replication complex. the dsRNA could be stained in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. the dsRNA colocalized strongly with JEV non-structural proteins. we studied the location of PTB during JEV infection and its localization with respect to JEV RNA by staining with dsRNA antibodies. in mock-infected Vero cells, PTB was located mostly in the nucleus and no dsRNA could be seen in the cell. more of PTB was seen in the cytoplasm at 24 h pi where it again showed colocalization with PTB. there was no significant difference in total PTB levels during the course of JEV infection. that cells were indeed infected with JEV was established by blotting the lysates with JEV NS1 antibody. this data demonstrated quantitative translocation of PTB from nucleus to cytoplasm upon JEV infection of vero cells. titers were 60% and 150% higher in PTB knocked-down cells infected at a moi of 0.1 and 1.0 respectively. this effect was reproduced in HEK cells. these data suggested an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. PTB knock-down and over-expression experiments together suggest an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication in mammalian cells. the knock-down of PTB label and its over-expression was established by Western blotting as before. levels of NS3 protein were significantly decreased in HEK cells. these observations were reproduced in HEK cells also. RNA and protein levels in PTB-silenced and over-expressing cells were measured 24 h pi. NS5 binds to the 5\u2032-NCR of the JEV genome and its complementary sequence in the antigenome. a constant amount of NS5 protein and increasing amount of PTB was added in a binding reaction with radiolabelled 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) RNA. however, binding of NS5 with 3NCR(-) RNA was completely inhibited with the increasing PTB concentration. RNA-protein binding reaction was carried out using 1 ng of radiolabelled (a) 5 NCR(+) RNA or (b) 3NCR(-) RNA with 600 ng JEV NS5 in the presence of increasing amounts of PTB. the RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked with UV treatment. the viral titers were 50% reduced at 18 h pi and this reduction was further pronounced to 80% at 24 h pi. increase in cAMP levels can inhibit JEV replication probably through PKA mediated phosphorylation of PTB. RNA - 5NCR(+) and the complementary sequence in the antigenome - 3NCR(-) were stable even in the presence of as high as 300 mM KCl in the binding reaction. the radiolabelled complex formation was inhibited when increasing amounts of corresponding cold RNA was added to the binding reaction. we also tested binding of PTB to 3SL(+) RNA as a negative control. RT-PCR of the precipitated RNA is expected to yield a 397-bp product in case it contained JEV RNA. HEK cells were lysed at 24 h post-infection (pi) and PTB-bound RNA precipitated using PTB antibody. RT-PCR of the precipitated RNA is expected to yield a 397-bp product. anti-dsRNA antibodies have been widely used to localize the flavivirus replication complex. the dsRNA could be stained in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. the dsRNA colocalized strongly with JEV non-structural proteins. we studied the location of PTB during JEV infection and its localization with respect to JEV RNA by staining with dsRNA antibodies. in mock-infected Vero cells, PTB could be seen in the cytoplasm as early as 6 h pi. more of PTB was seen in the cytoplasm at 24 h pi where it again showed colocalization with PTB. h pi it was 0.6-fold compared to that seen at 0 h pi. there was no significant difference in total PTB levels during the course of JEV infection. cytoplasmic, nuclear and total PTB levels were assessed. titers were 60% and 150% higher in PTB knocked-down cells infected at a moi of 0.1 and 1.0 respectively. this effect was reproduced in HEK cells. these data suggested an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. PTB knock-down and over-expression experiments together suggest an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication in mammalian cells. the knock-down of PTB label and its over-expression was established by Western blotting as before. levels of NS3 protein were significantly decreased in PTB over-expressing cells. these observations were reproduced in HEK cells also (data not shown) RNA and protein levels in PTB-silenced and over-expressing cells. NS5 binds to the 5\u2032-NCR of the viral replicase protein. a constant amount of NS5 protein and increasing amount of PTB was added in a binding reaction with radiolabelled 5NCR(+) and 3NCR(-) RNA. binding of NS5 with 3NCR(-) RNA was inhibited with the increasing PTB concentration. RNA-protein binding reaction was carried out using 1 ng of radiolabelled (a) 5 NCR(+) RNA or (b) 3NCR(-) RNA with 600 ng JEV NS5 in the presence of increasing amounts of PTB. the RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked with UV treatment. the viral titers were 50% reduced at 18 h pi and this reduction was further pronounced to 80% at 24 h pi. increase in cAMP levels can inhibit JEV replication probably through PKA mediated phosphorylation of PTB. PTB is a 531-amino acid, 58-kDa ubiquitous RNA-binding protein. it was originally identified as a protein with a role in splicing. the protein contains four RNA-recognition-motif type RNA binding domains. it has also been shown to interact with the genome of several single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. a polypyrimidine tract, CUUCUU (nucleotides 20\u201325 of JEV genome) exists in the 5\u2032 stem of the 5\u2032-NCR which may be involved in interaction with PTB. a polypyrimidine tract, CUUCUU (nucleotides 20\u201325 of JEV genome) exists in the 5\u2032-NCR. significantly reduced levels of plus-sense JEV RNA and enhanced viral titers. results suggest that PTB suppressed JEV replication in cells by inhibiting JEV genomic RNA synthesis. TGEV, a coronavirus with positive-strand RNA genome, has been shown to colocalize with the viral RNA in the cytoplasm [68] in case of DENV-2 infection, PTB was shown to translocate to the cytoplasm in vero cells [15] whereas no such translocation was seen in Huh 7 cells [13], [28]. single-stranded RNA initiates a cascade of signalling reactions. IL-6 and other cytokines are synthesized by cells following the JEV infection. increased levels of cAMP inhibited JEV replication through PTB translocation and binding to JEV RNA."}
