{"summary": "in the past decades, a number of experimental and theoretical approaches have been proposed to understand the functional dynamics of proteins. a number of experimental techniques including Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and NMR have succeeded in determining protein structures at the atomic level. however, limitations regarding simulation time scale, data size, and computational cost still exist. the chemical-bond based connection rule was proposed to improve the accuracy of stiffness and connectivity. in this model, one can reduce computation time by using smaller and more realistic distance-cutoff values of less than 8 without a loss of generality. in both cases, the orange spheres and lines represent the alpha carbons and their interactions, respectively. three alpha helix rich proteins are tested in order to compare the torsion angle distortion between the traditional distance-cutoff method and the proposed MWCENM. results To verify the proposed method, we determined the overlap values of the 10 closed-form proteins. these proteins were selected from the Macromolecular Movements Database. all structural information was obtained from the Protein Data Bank37. Matlab code for both MWCENM and traditional ENM was taken from KOSMOS. Figure 2 compares the NMA results of closed-form proteins by representing CSO distributions over the first twenty lowest modes. the first six zeros in the CSO values indicate rigid body motions. both methods have the largest increase in the CSO value at the 8th mode. both traditional ENM and MWCENM achieved nearly the same CSO distribution. one peak at the 12th mode involves remarkably different vibration behaviors. MWCENM captures the scissoring motion between the head and the two lobes. new tab The comparison of the important normal mode shapes of the closed-form of lactoferrin. N, S1, and S2 denote, respectively, the three domains of lactoferrin: head (green), left lobe (yellow), and right lobe (orange). the red arrows indicate the directional vectors at each residue. most high peaks are placed out of alpha helical regions. alpha helical regions are not easily identifiable from traditional ENM. the mode shape comparison between MWCENM and tradition ENM also supports these results. MWCENM replaces many unrealistic distance-based virtual springs in traditional ENM with realistic hydrogen bonds found in alpha helical regions. MWCENM usually requires less computational time than traditional ENM because it reduces the number of spring connections based on chemical information. MWCENM achieves both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency by optimizing the elastic network with various stiffness values according to the types of chemical interactions. MWCENM mostly shows higher CSO values than traditional ENM, and captures functionally important opening modes. the order of magnitude of the stiffness value is assigned to each spring on the basis of the order of averaged bonding energy for the corresponding chemical interaction. the strongest bonds, such as backbone covalent bonds, and disulfide bonds are easily modeled because a PDB file includes the information for these bonds. the equation of motion is derived from the lagrangian mechanics such that (1) where L = T \u2013 V. T and V mean the kinetic energy and potential energy of the given MWCENM, respectively. the overlap value is widely used to compare the similarity between the direction of conformational changes and the calculated normal mode of given protein. aij is the eigenvector of the ith alpha carbon at the jth normal mode, and ri is the displacement vector of the ith alpha carbon between the two given superimposed structures. the elastic network is constructed using two procedures called backbone modeling and spatial interaction modeling. four consecutive atoms along the backbone (i.e., from the ith to the i + 3th alpha carbon in proteins) are connected using virtual springs. hydrogen bonds are easily modeled because a PDB file includes the information for these bonds. the reliable energy state ranges up to 8.45. Table II summarizes the various stiffness values applied to MWCENM. Eq. (1) yields the following equation of motion and its full derivation is available at Ref. 16.

K is a global stiffness matrix that includes various sub-stiffness matrices Ki,j, which are derived from the potential energy. figure 6 illustrates the torsion angle defined by the angle between two plains 1 and 2, each of which is sequentially formed by three consecutive atoms among the four given atoms Ci2, Ci+1, Ci, and Ci+1."}
