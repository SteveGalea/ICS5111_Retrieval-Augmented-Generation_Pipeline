{"summary": "evolutionary dynamics play an important role in why and how we should manage wildlife disease. the threat of spreading existing and emerging pathogens is growing. the threat of spreading existing and emerging pathogens is growing. pathogen evolution follows the infection of a nave host population. evolution of reduced virulence is one of the hallmarks of pathogen evolution. evolution of reduced virulence is thought to occur on shorter timescales than host evolution. white-nose syndrome has caused unprecedented declines in bat populations in north America. the causal agent of white-nose syndrome is a fungus, Geomyces destructans. the fungus disrupts patterns of torpor resulting in increased mortality due to desiccation. recent evidence suggests that devil removal programmes are correlated with accelerated evolution of tetraploidy. the spread of disease has caused a change in life-history traits. however, our understanding of these diseases has been shaped by evolutionary ecologists such as may and Anderson (1983). the eco-evo epidemiological triangle introduces evolutionarily enlightened principles into the study and management of wildlife disease. the 'epidemiological triangle' is a typical pedagogical framework for understanding wildlife disease ecology. triangle suggests that three components are necessary for persistence of infectious disease: host, pathogen and environment. all three components, however, are involved in complex community interactions. these interactions are also affected by natural or anthropogenic environmental change. rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) was introduced to control the rabbits in the 1950s. in 1970s, populations were recovering and rabbit fleas were introduced to improve the efficacy of myxoma virus transmission. in 1990s, populations were recovering and RHD was released. disease suppression trials may have increased tetraploidy and favour slower growing tumours in the population. evolutionary principles have been considered in conservation response to DFTD, including selective captive rearing of resistant individuals. several vectorborne infectious diseases have recently expanded their range. habitat fragmentation could also be important and result in diverse selective effects. increased agriculture that results in fragmented landscapes can reduce habitat available for ticks that are vectors of several diseases. changes in species diversity will then affect disease prevalence through one of two mechanisms. dilution effect refers to a weakened disease risk by a given pathogen. amplification effect refers to an increased disease risk due to increased diversity. a theoretical model by Roche et al. (2012) suggests that the mean susceptibility in the host community has a positive effect on disease prevalence. higher species diversity increases the number of infected hosts, but decreases their proportion in the community. changes in host communities may lead to opposite outcomes in disease risk depending on ecological circumstances. a more detailed integration of the disease evolutionary history and adaptive potential of this disease could help predict and mitigate its impact. Applied evolution can be decomposed into four main categories: phenotypic and genetic variation, evolutionary history, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics. mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in avian malaria parasites revealed that several lineages often co-exist in a single host. there may be as many avian malaria lineages as there are bird species (10 000), in sharp contrast with the approximately 175 species recognized morphologically at the time. landscape genetics approaches have been widely applied to assess how landscape characteristics affect gene flow. pathogen phylogenetics revealed the role of human-induced movement in the spread of amphibian ranavirus in North American salamanders. pathogen phylogenetics revealed the role of farmed salmon in the transmission of piscine reovirus in wild populations. phylogenetic analysis remains central in determining the origin of epizootics crossing from wildlife to humans. phylogenetic analyses provide information on the likelihood of similar events occurring in the future. phylogenetics is a useful tool to help managers predict the probability of cross-species transmission. however, it is likely more challenging to then predict the strength of response a nave species will exhibit when exposed to a novel pathogen. diversity and adaptation can emerge within a few days. phylogenetic models can be applied on pathogen genetic or genomic data. these evolutionary trajectories also provide insights into infection and transmission dynamics. a more comprehensive integration of hosts and parasites life histories would improve our understanding of patterns of selection and evolution. a more comprehensive integration of hosts and parasites life histories would improve our understanding of patterns of selection and evolution. evolutionary responses to disease management have been described as a 'black box'. selective culling acts as a selective pressure that may result in increased virulence and disease prevalence. many diseases that can be relatively easily controlled in captive or domestic animals are very difficult to control in the wild. the risks of new wildlife diseases cannot be ignored, as they have potentially devastating consequences for wild and domestic species with substantial economic value. many wildlife diseases are a direct health concern to humans. rabies, malaria and plague have caused human mortality for centuries. rabies, malaria and plague have caused human mortality for centuries. these codynamics on a converged timescale have resulted in calls for evolutionarily enlightened management. calls to better integrate evolutionary principles \u2013 such as evolutionary history, variation, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics \u2013 into the management of infectious disease are becoming more frequent."}
