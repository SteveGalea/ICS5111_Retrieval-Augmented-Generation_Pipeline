{"summary": "the euroNHID (European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases) project collected data from 41 EDs and MADs in 14 european countries. they were located in the same facility as a national/regional referral centre for HIDs, using specifically developed checklists. EuroNHID includes 16 European Countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and United Kingdom) from February to November 2009, EuroNHID performed a survey in 48 isolation facilities identified by national health authorities as referral centres for the management of imported or autochthonous cases of HIDs. quaranty-one isolation facilities in 14 countries reported to have an ED or a MAD operating in the same medical centre. the department of the hospital is usually open round the clock, through which patients are admitted to the hospital. a standard evaluation form was developed to assess the status of each surveyed facility. the evaluation form is available at http://www.eunid.eu, after registration. the evaluation form is available at http://www.eunid.eu. Availability of negative pressure 17 (41,5) Dedicated ventilation system 16 (39,0) HEPA filtration of exhausted air 12 (29,3) Number of EDs/MADs with isolation room(s) equipped with all explored features 6 (14,6) Table 2. Availability of infection control procedures in 41 EDs and MADs in 14 European Countries No. (%) number of EDs/MADs surveyed 41 (100) General infection control procedures Availability of a reserved/separated waiting a consensus agreement was reached during the final meeting in Rome in may 2010. setting and participants national health authorities in all european countries were contacted to suggest a physician with expertise in HID management as project partner. this process led to the inclusion of 15 countries, while a Norwegian isolation facility later joined the group after direct request from the Coordination Team. the checklists are available on the website http://www.eunid.eu, after registration. all EDs and MADs were visited, except 2: in these cases, only fulfilled checklists were available. the Evaluation Form is available at http://www.eunid.eu, after registration. two members of the Coordination Team applied this Evaluation Form for each surveyed facilities, in order to identify all critical points. these Evaluation Forms were sent to contact persons at the surveyed facilities, asking for feedback. a dedicated route from ED/MAD to isolation ward for suspected HIDs 25 (61,0) if yes, by-passing other common areas 21 (51,2) if yes, the transport is performed by: stretcher isolator 8 (19,5) special ambulance through an external pathway 3 (7,3) different procedures depending on risk assessment 9 (21,9) with a normal stretcher, without special procedures 5 (12,2) * not routinely used in all surveyed EDs/MADs the figure 1 shows the level of adequacy of infection control in 41 EDs and MADs. the project explored the availability of triage staff specifically trained for the early recognition of suspected HID patients. the remaining 17 EDs and MADs have not specific strategies for the early recognition of suspected HID patients. a survey conducted in Atlanta, Georgia, after the 2009 pandemic, in 26 EDs revealed that 6 reported \"overcrowding,\" 1 reported \"severe overcrowding\" and 2 pediatric EDs reported \"dangerous overcrowding\" many EDs and MADs represent a key setting for the management of infectious diseases emergencies. EDs and MADs experienced the surge of cases due to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, that peaked in November 2009. the experience gained during the pandemic may have caused modifications and improvements of procedures and capabilities, not registered in our data. we believe that the occurrence of HIDs is more likely in these facilities, due to referral of suspected patients from other medical facilities. EPA filtration of exhausting air is present in 9 facilities only. negative pressure is necessary for the isolation of patients with confirmed or suspected diseases with obligate airborne transmission. presence of an anteroom increases efficiency of the system, providing an obstacle against pressure loss. triage staff lacking in 41,5% of surveyed EDs and MADs. in about half of them a patient with an HID could be unrecognized. triage procedures should include an assessment of disease severity/urgency. the availability of technically well-equipped and logistically adequate isolation rooms is fundamental. these rooms should have a separate access directly from outside, or be logistically isolated from other common areas. all HCWs, or at least dedicated personnel depending on EDs policies, should be familiar with PPE use, donning and removal, isolation procedures and disinfection issues. a study addressing the availability of preparedness plans before and after September 11 showed significant improvements. the pandemic in 2009 became a test-bed, with encouraging results. despite most (92%) of the facilities, the presence of plans did not assure their consistent application. influenza plans, 6 reported \"overcrowding,\" 1 reported \"severe overcrowding\" and 2 pediatric EDs reported \"dangerous overcrowding\" many reported space limitations including insufficient number of treatment rooms, insufficient waiting areas, or lack of space to designate a separate waiting room. a limit of our study is represented by the fact that surveys were performed before August 2009. in most of surveyed EDs and MADs at least one isolation room for the isolation and evaluation of suspected HID patients is available, but their logistic and technical level is generally not adequate. despite these limits, some comments are possible. the majority of surveyed EDs and MADs have logistically adequate waiting areas or procedures for surge capacity. we also explored the availability of procedures for early management of patients suspected to be affected by HIDs. some diagnostic tests and treatments can be performed by the EDs and MADs. simple standardized forms should be available for rapid use by triage personnel. a brief epidemiological investigation of patients with symptoms consistent with an HID may help in the rapid identification of suspected patients. detailed procedures should be available and rigorously applied. recommendations about core-curriculum for HCWs dealing with HIDs have been proposed [22], and should be adapted by responsible persons to ED and MAD settings. one HCW (from ED/MAD or from Infectious Diseases department according to local policies) should be responsible to monitor major on-line epidemiological alerts sites and bulletins, and to disseminate the news. SS, GDI, HRB, PB, HCM, BB, RG, GT and VP substantial contributed to design the study, participated in the acquisition and interpretation of data, and gave the final approval of the version to be published. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. italia-Ricerca Corrente, Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico."}
