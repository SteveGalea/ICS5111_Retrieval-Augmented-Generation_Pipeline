{"summary": "the microorganisms that have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. these bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets. neonatal piglets are particularly vulnerable to infectious enteric diseases. a few potentially pathogenic bacteria have been recently studied as a potential cause of neonatal enteritis. a few potentially pathogenic bacteria are present in clinically healthy animals. the non-diarrheic piglets had diarrhea for at least 2 days prior to euthanasia. the non-diarrheic piglets did not have diarrhea at any time. probes were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany. the probes were then washed 3 3 min in pre-warmed (45 \u00b0C) hybridization buffer and 3 3 min in pre-warmed (45 \u00b0C) washing buffer. escence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioimager M1 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 120-W HBO lamp. micrographs were taken using an AxioCam MRm version 3 firewire monocrome camera and AxioVision software, version 4.5. micrographs show semi-quantitative scores of fluorescence signals in the microscopic field. A. + small amount of bacteria (red), magnification 400x. C. +++ large amount of bacteria (red), magnification 400x. the non-diarrheic piglets did not have diarrhea at any time. they were selected from the litters with the highest prevalence of diarrhea. the reader is referred to Kongsted et al.; 2013. oligonucleotide probes used in this study target bacteria Name of the probe Target sequence (5\u2019-3\u2019) Target region of rRNA References Domain bacteria S-D-Eub-0338 5\u2019-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3\u2019 16S [10] Escherichia coli S-S-E.coli-1161 5\u2019-GCATAAGCGTCGCTGCC-3\u2019 23S [11] Enterococcus spp. micrographs were taken using an oimager M1 epifluorescence microscope. filter set 38 for detection of fluorescein, filter set 43 for detection of Cy3 and filter set 24 for simultaneous detection of green and red fluorescence. Statistical analyses Presence and localization of the investigated bacteria data were modeled with a mixed effects model. herd, diarrheic status, age and presence of histological lesions were explanatory variables, using neural networks for parameter estimation. in the small intestines positive signals for E. coli were seen in 88 % of diarrheic and 80 % of non-diarrheic piglets. in 33 % of diarrheic and 14 % of non-diarrheic piglets E. coli adhered to the villous epithelial cells. small amounts of E. coli are present in the intestinal lumen with no adhesion to the tissue. small amounts of E. coli are present in the intestinal lumen. positive fluorescence signals for C. perfringens were detected in 73 % of diarrheic and 78 % of non-diarrheic piglets. in 20 % of diarrheic and 30 % of non-diarrheic animals the bacteria were found within the mucus layer. sensitivity of FISH method for detection depends on many factors including metabolic activity of microbial cells and availability of target sequences in the tissue samples. in natural samples the fluorescence signal intensity may be too low for identification of microorganisms. microbial community detected by FISH is not possible when the bacteria are present in high concentration as it hinders distinction of fluorescence signals from single bacterial cell. adherent bacteria were seen in 37 % of diarrheic and 14 % of non-diarrheic piglets, thus expressed similar composition of eventual pathogens as the diarrheic ones. attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) have been associated with diarrhea in domestic animals including pigs. further work will be done towards identifying and defining pathogenicity of adherent E. coli found in this study. enterococcus spp. was seen in the small intestine of piglets that also had adherent E. coli. if these lesions were a consequence of a bacterial infection, they should be associated with E. coli rather than Enterococcus. pathologically, degenerative and necrotic changes in the intestinal mucosa are commonly associated with clostridial enteritis and the bacteria are usually present among the necrotic tissue [30] piglets were observed only in one diarrheic piglet in this study and it has been confirmed that this piglet was positive for C. perfringens type C [3], which in that case can be regarded as a cause of enteritis. non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. might be involved in neonatal diarrhea in pigs less than 1 week old. further identification of these bacteria is necessary to determine pathogenicity and role in this syndrome. authors of this research paper have no competing interests. technical support provided by the personnel of the section of Bacteriology, Pathology and Parasitology at the National Veterinary Institute. this study was supported by the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries."}
