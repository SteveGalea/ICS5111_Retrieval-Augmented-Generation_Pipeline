{"summary": "coronavirus infections in humans are associated with (common cold-like) upper respiratory tract infections. infections with zoonotic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4, 5) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) may lead to much more severe or even fatal respiratory disease in humans. coronavirus-infected cells require three replicase gene-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsp), called nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, that all contain conserved transmembrane domains (14\u201317). these ROs show remarkable parallels among different +RNA viruses that belong, for example, to the Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae, and Togaviridae families. fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. it is recruited to dengue virus replication complexes (30), hepatitis C virus (HCV), west Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and vaccinia virus (VV) replication (30\u201335) cPLA2 activity was shown to be critically involved in the production of infectious progeny of HCV and DENV. activity dispensable for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cPLA2 activity is required for HCoV-229E replication. inhibition of cPLA2 by Py-2 (20 M) was previously reported to reduce production of infectious virus progeny of different members of the Flaviviridae. we found that cell viability was not affected by Py-2 concentrations of up to 40 M. cPLA2 inhibitor Py-2 inhibits infectious HCoV-229E progeny in cell culture. a second PLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyltrifluoromethane (AACOCF3; C21H31F3O), was confirmed to reduce HCoV-229E replication at nontoxic concentrations. the data support a critical role of (activated) cPLA2 in HCoV-229E replication. the data support a critical role of (activated) cPLA2 in HCoV-229E replication. this lipolytic enzyme has a more general role in +RNA virus replication. i. were determined by plaque assay. signs compared to the results for untreated cells were determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. h p.i. had no effect on virus titers, indicating cPLA2 activity is not required for viral entry. presence of Py-2 from 2 to 6 h p.i. caused massive reduction of virus titers. less profound effects were observed if the drug was present in the culture medium later in infection. cPLA2 inhibition prevents the formation of viral RTCs. cPLA2 inhibition prevents the formation of viral RTCs. a profound antiviral effect was observed for Py-2 when given between 2 and 6 h p.i. the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. insets indicate regions of interest displayed at higher magnification in the next row. dsRNA and replicase gene-encoded nsp's are accepted as key components of viral RTCs. dsRNA and nascent RNA colocalize very well, suggesting that most dsRNA-containing structures represent ROs actively engaged in viral RNA synthesis. to further corroborate this hypothesis, we studied intracellular virions (ICVs) in approximately 50% of the cells analyzed per section and DMVs in approximately 40% of the cells analyzed per section. fewer DMVs were detected if the virus-infected cells were treated with Py-2 (Fig. 6C and D), with only 20% of the cells containing DMVs and 10 to 15% containing ICVs. in infected, untreated cells, we regularly observed clusters of around 15 DMVs. cPLA2 cleaves glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, generating an LPL and releasing AA. cPLA2 cleaves glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, generating an LPL and releasing AA. cPLA2 is a key inflammatory intermediate and important precursor. a previous study failed to obtain evidence for anticoronaviral activities of LOX and COX1/2 inhibitors. we argued against a major role of AA (and its downstream metabolites) in coronavirus replication. we made use of a fluorogenic phosphatidylcholine with (quenched) fluorophores attached to each of the two fatty acids. TCs with LPLs are shown in the extra colocalization channel shown to the right. the high colocalization rates and PCC values indicated in Fig. 7 are based on an automated and rather cautious method of calculation. cPLs produced by cPLA2 activity colocalize with LPLs produced by cPLA2 activity. lipids were isolated at 12 h p.i., a time when, under optimal conditions, DMVs have been formed. large amounts of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs have been produced. the quantities of selected lipid classes and categories were determined using shotgun lipidomics. the study provided evidence that a number of changes in the cellular lipidome occur in HCoV-229E-infected cells compared to the cellular lipidomes in both the mock control and cells incubated with UV-inactivated HCoV-229E. a correlation between Py-2 treatment and inhibition of viral replication and lipid quantities was observed. the total cellular LPL content was reduced upon treatment with Py-2. cPLA2 activity in HCoV-229E-infected cells suppressed the replication-associated increase of LPLs, resulting in an LPL content similar to those of (i) cells inoculated with UV-treated HCoV-229E and (ii) the mock control. cPLA2 inhibition on replication of other viruses prompted us to investigate potential antiviral effects of cPLA2 inhibitors on other viruses. the observed critical role of cPLA2 activity in modulating cellular membrane structures and total LPL content in HCoV-229E-infected cells. cPLA2 activity is required for HCoV-229E replication. cells were infected with MERS-CoV (Huh-7 and Vero cells) (A), SFV (BHK-21 cells) (B), human rhinovirus 1A (HeLa cells) (C), poliovirus (Vero cells) (D), vaccinia virus (Huh-7 cells) (E) and influenza A virus (A549 cells) at an MOI of 3. treatment with Py-2 resulted in reduced viral titers in a dose-dependent manner. HCoV-229E replication in the presence of 20 M Py-2 was also found to be reduced using MRC-5 and BEAS-B2 cells. this suggests that the observed antiviral effect of Py-2 is not cell type specific. at 2 h p.i., the virus inocula were replaced with cell culture medium containing the indicated concentrations of Py-2. supernatants were collected at 10, 12, 15, 21, and 24 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. a second PLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyltrifluoromethane, was confirmed to reduce HCoV-229E replication at nontoxic concentrations. Huh-7 cells treated for 12 h with the indicated concentrations of AACOCF3. cells were infected with HCoV-229E (MOI of 3) after 2 h, virus inoculum was replaced with cell culture medium containing the indicated concentrations of AACOCF3. 20 M Py-2 was included in the cell culture medium during virus adsorption. the presence of Py-2 from 2 to 6 h p.i. caused a massive reduction of virus titers. cPLA2 activity may be required for an early step in coronavirus replication. Western blot analysis of HCoV-229E nonstructural (nsp8) and structural (N) protein accumulation at 12 h p.i. in HCoV-229E-infected Huh-7 cells (MOI of 3) at 12 h p.i. cells were kept in medium containing indicated concentrations of Py-2. coronavirus RTCs are known to produce a typical perinuclear staining pattern when analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using reagents that detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and viral replicative proteins. in the presence of 20 M Py-2, the typical punctate staining described previously for HCoV-229E RTC components in virus-infected cells was greatly diminished. at 1 h p.i., the virus inoculum was replaced with medium containing 20 M actinomycin D to inhibit cellular DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. at 12 h p.i., cells were fixed and incorporation of alkyne-modified 5-EU was detected using click chemistry. dsRNA was stained using a dsRNA-specific MAb (red signal) dsRNA and nascent RNA colocalize very well, suggesting that most dsRNA-containing structures represent ROs actively engaged in viral RNA synthesis. dsRNA-containing structures represent ROs actively engaged in viral RNA synthesis, at least at this particular time point. data suggest an important role for cPLA2 activity in the process of DMV formation occurring early in infection. if cPLA2 activity was inhibited at later time points, DMV formation was not significantly affected compared to that in untreated HCoV-229E-infected cells. cPLA2 cleaves glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, generating an LPL and releasing AA. the latter is a key inflammatory intermediate and important precursor that is metabolized by multiple enzymes, including cyclooxygenases 1/2 and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) liposome-mediated uptake of PC-A2 and PLA2 (including cPLA2)-mediated cleavage of the fatty acid attached to the sn-2 position of this fluorogenic substrate was monitored by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. to investigate a possible colocalization of LPLs and viral RTCs, PC-A2-treated and infected cells were fixed. the cells were infected with HCoV-229E (MOI of 3) and incubated with PC-A2. at 12 h p.i., the cells were fixed and immunostained for dsRNA. colocalization rates and PCCs are indicated. the results were shown for Huh-7 cells alone, incubated with UV-inactivated HCoV-229E, infected with HCoV-229E, and infected with HCoV-229E. also shown are the abundance of phosphatidic acids (C), ceramides (D), lysophospholipids (E) and phosphatidylglycerols (PG) phosphatidic acid (PA) abundance was decreased in Py-2-treated and in HCoV-229E-infected cells at 12 h p.i. for ceramides (Cer), an increased abundance was detected in Py-2-treated and in HCoV-229E-infected cells. however, Py-2 treatment of infected cells did not alter the ceramide content any further. the level of PG was 2-fold increased in HCoV-229E-infected cells. Py-2 treatment alone had a minor effect on (total) PG abundances. however, PG species with shorter acyl chains were clearly affected by the inhibitor. antiviral effect of Py-2 could also be confirmed for SFV. cPLA2 activity may also be involved in replication of togaviridae. vaccinia virus, a DNA virus from the family Poxviridae, was not found to be affected by Py-2. supernatants were collected and virus titers were determined by focus-forming assay (FFU/ml) or plaque assay (PFU/ml) titers were obtained with untreated cells were determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. despite their enormous genetic diversity, virtually all +RNA viruses employ specialized membrane compartments (replicative organelles [ROs] as structural scaffolds for their multisubunit replication machinery. cPLA2 activity was confirmed to be required for coronavirus replication. but the cPLA2 inhibitor was also effective against SFV. the precise role of cPLA2 in the production of fully functional ROs remains to be established. cPLA2 may change the membrane phospholipid packing through its hydrophobic C2 domain to induce the membrane bending required for phagosome formation in macrophages. a large number of other factors have been shown to induce membrane curvature in diverse biological systems. whole-cell lipidome analyses of coronavirus-infected cells were performed. phosphatidic acid (PA) species are downregulated, whereas ceramide (Cer) and LPL species are upregulated in HCoV-229E-infected cells. possible biological implications of the observed downregulation of PA remain to be studied. Aktepe et al. (77) also showed that inhibition of Cer synthesis has detrimental effects on WNV (strain Kunjin) replication. the replication of deNV serotype 2 strain new Guinea C was found to be enhanced. this suggests the effects of Cer and Cer-derived lipids on +RNA virus replication are complex and, potentially, virus (strain) specific. changes in lipidomes, including LPLs, were reported for cells infected with HCV and DENV (33, 78), further corroborating the hypothesis that LPLs have important but diverse functions in different +RNA virus systems. to explore potential inhibitory effects of Py-2, several other viruses known to rearrange cellular membranes were included in this study. human hepatoma cells (Huh-7), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), African green monkey kidney cells (BHK-21), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), human lung epithelial cells (A549), human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-B2), human cervix epithelial cells (HeLa) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK-II) were grown in Dulbecco' Arachidonyltrifluoromethane (AACOCF3) (C21H31F3O, 356.5 g/mol), an analog of AA that inhibits cPLA2 by direct binding (79), was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. the MEK inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 were purchased from Selleckchem. cell culture supernatants were collected at 12 h p.i. after 2 h, the virus inoculum was removed. cells were rinsed with PBS and inoculated for 1 h at 33\u00b0C. the cells were washed again with PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. the cells were stained with an AEC (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole) for 1 h at room temperature.
