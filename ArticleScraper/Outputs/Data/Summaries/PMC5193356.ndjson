{"summary": "airborne transmission of viruses has been demonstrated for some diseases, including measles [1] and smallpox [2]. indoor environments are particularly advantageous for viral transmission, including hospital settings where transmission of nosocomial diseases is a major concern [4\u20136] gaseous disinfectant has been tested to inactivate viruses deposited on various surfaces at temperatures ranging from 25\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C. some investigators have looked at the potential of chemical solutions such as gaseous chlorine dioxide to kill aerosolized bacteria and fungi in indoor settings. chlorine dioxide is highly reactive and requires extreme safety precautions, which preclude its use for routine disinfection. phages X174 (Microviridae family), 6 (Cystoviridae family), and PR772 (Tectiviridae family) have also been requently used. previous studies have demonstrated that phages 6 and PR772 displayed resistance to aerosolization and air sampling similar to the influenza virus. broth and tryptic soy agar culture media were purchased from Difco Laboratory (Detroit, MI). phage PR772 was amplified on TSB soft agarose (0.75%) plates. lysates were titrated on their respective bacterial hosts.

RNA was stored at \u201380\u00b0C or processed immediately for cDNA synthesis.

RNA was heated (100\u00b0C, 5 minutes) before performing cDNA synthesis using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) samples were labeled with FAM dye in 5\u2019 and with a combination of Zen and Iowa black FQ quencher in 3\u2019. qPCR was used to measure total phage genomes in all samples. qPCR was used to measure infectious phages in all samples. phages in air samples were calculated by dividing the number of infectious phages by the number of phage genomes estimated by qPCR. because infectious ratio is affected by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR efficiency, the value may be below or above 1. infectious ratios can be used to compare the effect of environmental conditions on each phage. the univariate normality assumption was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk tests on the error distribution from the statistical model after a Cholesky factorization. when appropriate, some variables were log-transformed to fulfill the model assumptions. no significant effect of RH or exposure time was observed for phage MS2. however, there was a significant difference between exposure to 25% and 50% RH for phages 6 and PR772 (p0.0001). the reference values obtained without germicidal product are represented by the dotted lines in Figs 2\u20134. results obtained with 50% RH were below detection limit. the dotted line indicates the reference value without a. all germicidal products had a significant effect on phage MS2 relative infectivity ratios at 25% RH (p0.003) and 50% RH (p0.005) duration of chemical exposure also had a significant impact on phage MS2. experiments were conducted at 19\u00b0C with 25% and 50% RH. no significant effect of exposure time or of chemical agent was observed. phage PR772 was highly stable when exposed to 25% RH. however, it was very unstable at 50% RH, suggesting a preference for a less humid environment. effect of Pledge\u00ae (black squares), Eugenol (gray circles), MiST\u00ae (white triangles) and H2O2 (gray inverted triangles) on airborne phage MS2 relative infectivity ratios at 25% and 50% RH. dotted line indicates reference value without chemical agent for same RH and exposure time. a reduction of MS2 infectious particles was observed between 1 and 2 hours of exposure with all germicidal products at 25% RH. at 25% RH, 1 hour and 2 hour exposure times using Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol were 5\u201310 times more efficient than MiST\u00ae and H2O2. Pledge\u00ae was significantly more effective in reducing phage 6 relative infectious ratios. all plaque assay results were below the detection limit with phage 6 at 50% RH. environmental conditions and time spent airborne are also critical factors affecting the survival of microbes. phage PR772 is more infectious at middle and high RH levels (50% and 80%) compared to low RH levels (20% or 25%, [15], whereas phage 6 was more resistant at low RH (20% or 25%), compared to medium (50%) and high RH [15]. Previously, phage X174 was found to be more resistant to 80% RH compared to 20% and 50%. relative infectious ratios of phage 6 were above one when aerosolized with MiST\u00ae (containing Triethylene glycol) the relative infectious ratios were below one with Pledge\u00ae, Eugenol, and H2O2 at 25% RH and with Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol at 50% RH. this may suggest a protective effect on phage infectivity. ethanol- and isopropanol-based solutions (>30%) are slowly aerosolized compared to water-based solutions (more than 7 times longer to aerosolize the same volume) the aeroneb Lab is widely used in drug delivery assays because it is non-destructive. two hours of exposure to Pledge\u00ae or Eugenol were necessary for a 1-log reduction of infectious phage MS2. for phages 6 and X174, this 1-log reduction was achieved after only 10 minutes (time 0) of exposure to Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol. the average limit of exposure to H2O2 over an eight hour work shift recommended by the ACGIH is 1 ppm. n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride were 2 ppm. the TWA guidelines for these quaternary ammonium salts are not available. environmental conditions and time spent airborne are also critical factors affecting the survival of microbes. s were passed through diffusion dryers to remove humidity before being mixed with aerosolized agents. the lowest RH that could be reached in experiments using H2O2 and MiST\u00ae was 25%. phage PR772 is more infectious at middle and high RH levels (50% and 80%) compared to low RH levels (20% or 25%, [15]. products Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol reduced the relative infectious ratios of all airborne phages tested. however, the effect was only statistically significant for the two RNA phages. the relative infectious ratios of phage 6 were above one when aerosolized with MiST\u00ae. the aeroneb Lab is widely used in drug delivery assays because it is non-destructive. it can be used between 5 to 30 liters of air per minute without influencing the liquid volume nebulized. it was necessary to fit the germicidal nebulization time within the phage\u2019s nebulization times. despite lower concentrations of germicides in the chamber compared to MiST\u00ae and H2O2, Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol led to the highest reduction (up to 3 logs) of airborne viruses. previous studies have demonstrated that 10\u201320 seconds of exposure to UV light or ozone reduces 90% of the remaining infectious viruses in an aerosol chamber. the concentration of Isopropanol (from Pledge\u00ae) used in this study is 25 times below the ACGIH TWA recommended guidelines. the concentration of the two other active ingredients in Pledge\u00ae (n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) was 2ppm."}
