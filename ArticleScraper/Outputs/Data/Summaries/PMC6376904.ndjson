{"summary": "hDPP4+/+ mice were unexpectedly more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice to MERS-CoV infection, as judged by increased LD50, reduced lung viral infection, attenuated morbidity and mortality. the resistance to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with increased serum shDPP4 and serum virus neutralizing activity. interbreeding between hDPP4+/+ mice produced additional hDPP4+/+ mice. backcrossing them to wt mice generated hDPP4+/ mice. in vitro and animal studies involving infectious MERS-CoV were conducted. hDPP4+/ mice were inoculated with doses of EMC-2012 MERS-CoV in 10fold decrements from 102 to 10\u20131 TCID50 in a volume of 60 L. LD50 values for each strain of mice were estimated based on the ratio of the surviving mice to the total inoculated mice. only those showing specific antibody to RBD were considered as \u201cMERS-CoV infected\u201d. rshDPP4 containing an N-terminal human CD5 signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag was prepared and used for treatment studies. testing binding specificity of the rshDPP4 to the RBD proteins of MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was determined in ELISA-based assays. hDPP4+/+ breeder mice were derived by mating 2 parental hDPP4+/+ mice. interbreeding between hDPP4+/+ mice produced additional hDPP4+/+ mice, while backcrossing them to wt mice generated hDPP4+/ mice. Detailed methodologies for viral infection, isolation from infected lungs and brain, and determination of infectious viral loads have been established and routinely used in our laboratory. the original stock of MERS-CoV EMC-2012 strain, a gift of Heinz Feldmann and Ron A. Fouchier, was expanded in vero E6 cells 3 times consecutively. a commercial ELISA-based assay was used to quantify the circulating shDPP4 in the sera of naive DPP4+/+, DPP4+/, and DPP4/ mice. only those showing specific antibody to RBD were considered as \u201cMERS-CoV infected\u201d. rshDPP4+/ mice were treated twice with either 100 g or 400 g of rshDPP4 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as control. mice were sacrificed at 3 dpi to assess infectious viral loads and histopathology. hDPP4+/+ mice are more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice to MERS-CoV infection. hDPP4+/+ mice were more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice. hDPP4+/+ mice are more resistant than heterozygous hDPP4+/+ mice. the LD50 values of age- and sex-matched hDPP4+/+ and hDPP4+/ mice. euthanized mice with equal dose of MERS-CoV (103 TCID50/per mouse) three mice of each strain, unless indicated otherwise, were euthanized at 3, 5, and 7 dpi to assess infectious viral titers and the histopathology of lungs and brains. infected hDPP4+/+ mice exhibited minimal weight changes. the virus titer in the brain was 106.2/g for the single hDPP4+/ mouse. this ability to recover infectious virus from the lungs is consistent with the pattern, kinetics, and tissue distribution of MERS-CoV infection in hDPP4 Tg mice. hDPP4+/+ mice exhibit significantly higher levels of soluble hDPP4 in sera than those of hDPP4+/ Mice. a representative of 2 independently performed studies, an average of 8.1 0.2 g/mL (mean SD) and 6.2 0.4 g/mL of shDPP4 was detected in hDPP4+/+ (n = 16) and DPP4+/ mice (n = 10) the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) were 3.9 0.3 and 3.1 0.1 for hDPP4+/+ and hDPP4+/mice respectively (P =.026) compared to those of hDPP4/ mice uniformly below the limit of detection (i.e., 3.0) the GMT titers of hDPP4/ mice were uniformly below the limit of detection. hDPP4+/ mice showed moderate titers of live virus. titers of infectious virus within the lungs were unable to recover. mice treated with 400 g of rshDSPP4 showed significantly increased titers 2 hours after treatment (6.6 0.6 increased to 13.7 0.8 g/mL; P =.002, t test) rshDPP4 proteins derived from insect cells specifically bind to receptor binding domain protein of MERS-CoV. ELISA 96-well plates precoated with rshDPP4 protein of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV were used to determine binding specificity of rshDPP4. the modified vero E6-based microneutralization test (virus yield) was used to quantify the neutralizing capacity of rshDPP4. aMice (n = 3 each group) were given either 100 L of PBS or PBS containing 100 or 400 g of rshDPP4/per mouse by the intraperitoneal route 2 hours before and 24 hours after intranasal challenge with 100 LD50 (approximately 103 TCID50) of MERS-CoV. hDPP4+/+ mice are more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice to MERS-CoV infection. hDPP4+/+ mice were more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice. hDPP4+/+ mice were more resistant than hDPP4+/ mice. PP4+/+ mice are more resistant than their age- and sex-matched hDPP4+/+ counterparts to MERS-CoV infection and disease. the LD50 values of age- and sex-matched hDPP4+/+ and hDPP4+/ mice are representative of 2 independently performed studies. dpi, days postinfection; LD50, 50% lethal dose; TCID50, 50% cell culture infectious dose. sera collected 21 dpi from each strain of Tg mice that survived lower challenge dosages. infected hDPP4+/+ mice with equal dose of MERS-CoV. the virus titer in the brain was 106.2/g for the single hDPP4+/ mouse. this ability to recover infectious virus from the lungs is consistent with the pattern, kinetics, and tissue distribution of MERS-CoV infection in hDPP4 Tg mice we have previously reported. hDPP4+/+ mice exhibit significantly higher levels of soluble hDPP4 in sera than those of hDPP4+/ Mice. a representative of 2 independently performed studies, an average of 8.1 0.2 g/mL (mean SD) and 6.2 0.4 g/mL of shDPP4 was detected in hDPP4+/+ (n = 16) and DPP4+/ mice (n = 10) the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) were 3.9 0.3 and 3.1 0.1 for hDPP4+/+ and hDPP4+/mice respectively (P =.026) compared to those of hDPP4/ mice uniformly below the limit of detection (i.e., 3.0) neutralization titers of 50% neutralization titer (NT50) were uniformly below the limit of detection. titers of hDPP4+/ mice were uniformly below the limit of detection. mice treated with 400 g of rshDSPP4 showed significantly increased titers 2 hours after treatment (6.6 0.6 increased to 13.7 0.8 g/mL; P =.002, t test). mice treated with 400 g of rshDSPP4 showed significantly increased titers 2 hours after treatment. ELISA 96-well plates, precoated with RBD protein of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, were used to determine the binding specificity of rshDPP4 to MERS-CoV RBD. absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. aMice (n = 3 each group) were given either 100 L of PBS or PBS containing 100 or 400 g of rshDPP4/per mouse by the intraperitoneal route 2 hours before and 24 hours after intranasal challenge. the pulmonary histopathology was examined to investigate the effect of rshDPP4 on MERS-CoV infection. treated with 400 g of rshDPP4 were significantly reduced from an average of 4.3 0.3 (mean SE) in control mice to 2.6 0.1 TCID50/g (P =.011, t test) this finding is consistent with the reduced potency of batch 2 of rshDPP4. however, the histopathology in mice treated with the high dose of rshDPP4 (ie, 400 g) was reduced as well when compared to membrane-associated hDPP4 plays a pivotal role in MERS-CoV infection and disease. but specific role(s) that shDPP4 might have in MERS pathogenesis remain much less understood. soluble forms of the viral receptors for several other viruses have been proposed as potentially effective antiviral therapeutics. it took at least 12.5 g of rshDPP4+/+ mice to significantly inhibit MERS-CoV infection in vero E6 cells. additional studies are needed to better understand the shDPP4-related protective mechanisms against MERS-CoV."}
