{"summary": "case-study reports on 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks have discussed the role of quarantine in the community in transmission. however, this literature has not yielded quantitative estimates of the reduction in secondary cases attributable to quarantine. public health agencies need to have weighed evidence of potential costs and benefits of these manoeuvres before the next outbreak of a severe, novel infection. quantitative evidence available to inform policy-makers on the potential benefit of community-based quarantine in outbreak control, based on the SARS experience. ative research uses data from the 2003 Ontario, Canada (hereafter, Ontario), SARS outbreak to demonstrate statistical approaches to the evaluation of modern quarantine measures. we propose a series of measures of reduction of adverse outcomes (analogous to those used in other contexts), to evaluation of quarantine. we also report the inverse of this statistic, interpretable as Number Need to Quarantine (NNQ). the predictor variable of interest was whether or not each contact became a SARS case (binary outcome) the predictor variable of interest was whether the associated index case was in community quarantine at symptom onset. the outcome variable here is not the rate of secondary transmission among a variable number of potentially exposed community contacts per index case. the outcome variable here is not the rate of secondary transmission among a variable number of potentially exposed community contacts per index case. the outcome variable here is not the rate of secondary transmission among a variable number of potentially exposed community contacts per index case. sensitivity analysis was carried out using the canonical (log link) Poisson regression model. for the sensitivity analysis, we re-estimated SCCD and NNQ. this group consisted of quarantined contacts who were, prospectively, under suspicion of being SARS cases themselves, but in whom SARS was later excluded. the total number of community contacts associated with these index cases, for this analysis, was 8,498. for all community contacts, outcome status as a secondary SARS case was defined. the predictor variable of interest was whether the associated index case had been in community quarantine. the exposure of interest is whether or not the index case was quarantined. we calculated several measures of association to describe the difference in transmission observed in the quarantine and non-quarantine group. the SSCR is a function of the ratio of secondary cases per index case. SCCD is the difference in the average absolute number of secondary cases in the quarantine versus non-quarantine conditions (SCnq-SCq) this model yields a (non-exponentiated) beta coefficient interpreted as the difference in outcome [26] NNQ is the number of cases that would need to be in quarantine at symptom onset to prevent one case among contacts of an index case. nonnormality of residuals in models including total contacts was corrected by transforming the total number of the contacts (replaced with square root of value) tests for over-dispersion were carried out, correcting for over-dispersion. identical models using negative binomial error term were also run, correcting for over-dispersion. in the 2003 outbreak, includes all cases with a final disposition of suspect or probable SARS. included 8,498 community contacts with contact to one SARS case. not a second SARS case within 10 days of exposure to the first. -1.15209 -1.15209 0.026 0.057 0.589 -2.16906 -2.33953 -5.32984 -0.13511 0.03535 3.02567 Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD = exponentiated Beta for quarantine) Poisson, asymptotic: Neg.Binomial, asymptotic: Poisson, bootstrapped: -0.13322 -0.13322 0.001 0.002 1.000 the first model treating index cases as the unit of analysis yields an estimate of SCCR of 0.316. the average difference in secondary SARS cases in moving from non-quarantine to quarantine status is estimated at 0.133 secondary cases per index case. when negative binomial regression was used to estimate SCCR, this became non-significant (p = 0.057) the adjusted models in Table 3 also show that the number of close contacts was a significant predictor of the number of secondary cases, even when adjusting for total number of contacts. the NNQ estimate drops from 7.51 to 5.74, giving the appearance of a still greater benefit. a review of simulation studies on quarantine effectiveness for control of SARS has been presented by Bauch and colleagues. simulation studies serve several purposes in outbreak research, one of which is to estimate the impact of control measures in outbreak scenarios [1,33] a persistent concern raised is that results are driven by prior assumptions. the true value of case reports, arguably, is the rich contextual information on challenges faced and unexpected events. some studies reported on the effect of quarantine in shortening the time from onset of symptoms to isolation. others report quarantine yield (the proportion of individuals quarantined who eventually develop SARS) [36], which reflects specificity of contact tracing versus burden from unnecessary quarantine. NNQ for the Ontario outbreak was 7.5 persons in quarantine to one SARS case averted using data from probable or suspected SARS cases. NNQ compares very favourably with NNTs reported for public health interventions such as chemoprophylaxis for leprosy. the case of quarantine is distinct even from vaccination, in that all potential benefit is to other persons. the creation of sets of cases and their contacts as independent units of analysis goes only part-way toward a complete network-based analysis. a second challenge to evaluators might be non-familiarity with regression models for count data. health status, employment, family structure and other factors may confound the association between quarantine status and observed transmissions. the best possible observational design would permit evaluation of the decision made by public health officials to place individuals under quarantine. the best possible observational design would permit evaluation of the decision made by public health officials to place individuals under quarantine. paper on the SARS experience has spoken about the importance of data management resources. none made explicit recommendations for statistical evaluation of control measures. existing outbreak data may yield more information to evaluate outbreak control measures than has been reported. the applicability of this evidence to the current experience with pandemic influenza is less certain. simulation studies suggest community quarantine and isolation may play a role in influenza control. transmission patterns for influenza make it less likely contact tracing and quarantine would be fast enough to avoid transmission. a recent review on control measures for influenza cited no simulation studies. the impact of control measures is implied from qualitative observation. some reports appeared well after the outbreak, with efforts to complete data on onset dates and transmission in hindsight. no reduction in R attributable to control was presented. the approach allowed no consideration of individual-level covariates. NNQ compares very favourably with NNTs for public health interventions. a complication is the unit of analysis for the outcome relative to the intervention. NNV has been estimated incorporating herd immunity. the case of quarantine is distinct even from vaccination. studies of real outbreaks need to be considered. small samples tend to overstate precision relative to bootstrapping. in some jurisdictions, comprehensive quarantine procedures may eliminate control arm. case-reports discussed problems with prospective record-keeping, in terms of detailed contact tracing and the implications of time-lags in serological testing. measure error is likely with other important information, such as documenting level of contact and therefore numbers of individuals at risk by contact level. paper on the SARS experience has spoken about the importance of data management resources and described core data to be tracked during an outbreak. difference or NNT can be interpreted without consideration of the absolute costs of not acting, and the harm side of the decision [56]. this discussion must include the severity of the illness, as well as harms of intervention to the individual and society. studies to evaluate control measures for one agent may not be generalizable to others. authors' contributions All listed authors made substantial contributions to conception and design of the analysis presented in this manuscript. all authors were involved in defining the objectives for the present analysis; in determining case selection and definition for the present analysis; and in interpretation of results."}
