{"summary": "the present study aims to assess the impact of model building strategy on the epidemic threshold under vaccination. we consider two different types of mathematical models, one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness. the other based on unobservable information of infection event and infectiousness (the unobservable model) i.e. the so-called \u201cbackcalculation method\u201d, to infer the time of infection based on the dataset of illness onset [2]\u2013[5]. ignoring the unobservable nature during model formulation would complicate the model fitting to empirical data. in many instances, a temporal distribution of infected individuals is analyzed. most frequently, the best available dataset is the daily counts of cases. a previous study recognized the importance of asymptomatic transmission in considering the feasibility of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. in the past, the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the transmission dynamics tended to be modeled by employing the widely adopted SEIR model while splitting infectious individuals into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. observable model may be referred to as the \u201csymptom-based\u201d model. the model describes the transitions depending on illness onset and recovery from clinical symptoms. the model describes the transitions depending on acquirement or disappearance of infectiousness. we consider an initial growth phase of an epidemic at which the depletion of susceptible individuals S 0 is negligible. the new infection and new illness onset are written as (2) where (t) is, by adopting a mass action principle, parameterized as: (3) where A() and S() are the infection-age and disease-age dependent rates of secondary transmission. the unobservable model can be said to be the infection-age structured SEIR model that further classifies infectious individuals into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. let E(t,), I A(t,,) and I S(t, be the numbers of pre-infectious individuals, asymptomatic infectious individuals, respectively, at calendar time t, infection-age and disease-age. underlying assumptions of using a parameter k in the unobservable model remain unclear. we impose additional assumptions to the observable model, thereby permitting it to resemble the SEIR-like unobservable model. parameter values are adopted to numerically calculate the threshold quantities and other associated variables of observable and unobservable models. smallpox is considered for the exposition of the similarity between two different models, because it involves very few asymptomatic transmissions [14], [25], [26]. two models We consider two different types of mathematical models. one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness. the other based on unobservable information including infection event and infectiousness. the unobservable model may also be referred to the \u201csymptom-based\u201d model. the model describes the transitions depending on illness onset and recovery from clinical symptoms. once infected individuals experience asymptomatic period, J A. we consider an initial growth phase of an epidemic at which the depletion of susceptible individuals S 0 is negligible. two boundary conditions, i.e., the new infection and new illness onset, are written as (2) where (t) is, by adopting a mass action principle, parameterized as: (3) where A() and S() are the infection-age and disease-age dependent rates of secondary transmission. the unobservable model can be said to be the infection-age structured SEIR model that further classifies infectious individuals into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. let E(t,), I A(t,,) and I S(t, be the numbers of pre-infectious individuals, asymptomatic infectious individuals, respectively, at calendar time t, infection-age and disease-age. underlying assumptions of using a parameter k in the unobservable model remain unclear. we impose additional assumptions to the observable model, thereby permitting it to resemble the SEIR-like unobservable model. smallpox is considered for the exposition of the similarity between two different models, because it involves very few asymptomatic transmissions [14], [25], [26]. smallpox is considered for the exposition of the similarity between two different models, because it involves very few asymptomatic transmissions. observable model is intended to mimic the SEIR structure. asymptomatic infected individuals are supposed to develop symptom after spending the incubation period. asymptomatic non-infectious individuals will not become symptomatic. the fate of experiencing symptomatic infection is determined upon infection with a probability, similar to that taking place when acquiring infectiousness. those who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection (i.e. H A+I) is referred to as \u201cfully\u201d asymptomatic, while those who eventually develop symptoms, H S is referred to as \u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d for clarity. the unobservable model (Figure 1B) must agree with the observable one. the recovery from an infectious state should also be identical to the recovery from symptomatic illness. the basic reproduction number of the special case model (14) is rewritten as follows: (16) Let R a and R pre be the average numbers of secondary cases generated by a single (fully) asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic case, respectively. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single fully asymptomatic case should be identical between (16) and (17), i.e., (18) shaded area represents the plausible parameter region of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmissions among the total asymptomatic transmissions, g, for a specific disease. if the number of fully asymptomatic transmissions is smaller than other transmissions (in the case of influenza and smallpox), R 0 is an increasing function of g. 2() and L 3() in (21) are written as (22) The next-generation matrix of the observable model under vaccination is obtained from ([28]: (26) where w is the ratio of R 4 to R 3 and is identical to m if A = B. the effective reproduction number is the dominant eigenvalue of these matrices, i.e., (27) where only R v,obs is consistent with the data generating process of q D. the relationship was reversed for smallpox and varicella. the critical level of influenza is clearly different between two models for influenza. the difference in the critical coverage was most apparent for HIV/AIDS. the fate of experiencing symptomatic infection is determined upon infection with a probability. those who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection (i.e. H A+I) is referred to as \u201cfully\u201d asymptomatic, while those who eventually develop symptoms, H S is referred to as \u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d for clarity. symptomatic, H and S are the rates of transmission caused by pre-symptomatic individuals. m is multiplied to only the first integral term, because m is defined as the infectiousness of \u201cfully\u201d asymptomatic individuals relative to that among those who experience symptomatic state in the observable model. g = 0 is the special case in which the observable model is fully consistent with the unobservable model. as g increases, R 0 for smallpox and influenza are elevated. however, R 0 for smallpox and influenza are lowered as g. the impact of varying the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmissions among all asymptomatic transmissions on the basic reproduction number, R 0. only the value of g (and the corresponding ) in the model is varied. shaded area represents the plausible parameter region of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmissions among the total asymptomatic transmissions, g, for a specific disease. the survival rates L 1(), L 2() and L 3() in (21) are written as (22) The next-generation matrix of the observable model under vaccination is given by the integral of (), i.e., (23) Let F() and L() be matrices that describe the class-age dependent rate of the appearance of new infections and the proportion of those who remain infectious. smallpox, influenza and varicella were examined as a function of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness, q D. the relationship was reversed for HIV, and in particular, R v,obs of HIV was independent of q D due to the assumed absence of secondary transmission following the onset of AIDS. the present study analyzed and compared observable and unobservable modeling approaches. two major tasks have been completed. first, we aimed to clarify underlying assumptions of the unobservable model that involves asymptomatic transmission. only the observable model can directly incorporate vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness. the unobservable model is not perfect, largely missing the information of infectiousness in the model structure. a model that accounts for both observable and unobservable information within a single model can easily address the dependence structure between clinical illness and infectiousness. tion period and latent period are critical factors in determining effectiveness of public health interventions including contact tracing and case isolation [9], [37]\u2013[39]. an appropriate combination of well-designed experiments (or observations) and statistical inference could shed light on the scientific approach to (i) considering both illness and infectiousness."}
