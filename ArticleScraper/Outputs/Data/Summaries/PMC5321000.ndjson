{"summary": "CHIKV nsP3 Macrodomain removes mono(ADP-Ribose) from Modified Aspartate and Glutamate, but not Lysine Residues. we subcloned nsP3MD from the CHIKV vaccine strain 181/Clone 25 (181/25) into a bacterial expression plasmid and purified recombinant nsP3MD to homogeneity for in vitro characterization CHIKV nsP3MD removes ADP-ribose from modified PARP10CD. nsP3MD possesses enzymatic activity for hydrolysis of ADP-ribose groups from MARylated substrates. phosphoribosylated peptides were then digested and enriched by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. this approach identified six highly confident phosphoribosylated sites on PARP10CD. nsP3MD is capable of removing MAR from modified aspartate and glutamate, but not lysine residues on PARP10CD. nsP3MD mutated residues D10, G32, T111, G112 and R144. mutations affected MAR hydrolase activity of recombinant nsP3MD. mutant enzymes possessed 75% and 48% of WT levels. CHIKV nsP3MD mutants are defective in MAR hydrolase activity. active site of nsP3MD bound to ADP-ribose (37) highlighting residues targeted in this study. 5.3 G112E NDB 3.7 2.5 No Reverted to WT N/A N/A N/A Category 2 Y114A 4.84 0.69 40.6 4.2 Yes 16 (Delayed) 75 5.3 G32E V113R Y114N 6.46 1.25 15.0 7.2 No Reverted to either G32A V113R Y114N or V113R Y114N N/A N/A N/A Hydrolase activity is calculated as a percentage of ns nsP3MD mutants with impaired hydrolase activity have lower affinity for ADP-ribose than the WT protein. nsP3MD MAR Hydrolase activity and ADP-ribose binding are critical. plasmid containing full-length cDNA of RNA genome of CHIKV 181/25. resulting RNA was transfected into BHK-21 cells for virus production. viruses produced from transfection of CHIKV 181/25 RNA with D10A, G32E, and G112E had reverted the mutated residue back to the original residue. CHIKV replication is incompatible with nsP3MD mutations that severely attenuate MAR hydrolase activity. nsP3 MAR hydrolase activity in nsP3MD mutants is critical for CHIKV replication. mutants with single mutations at G32 replicated less well than the parent virus. yield was further lowered with the T111A mutant, which has an intermediate hydrolase activity between G32A and G32S mutant. limiting ADP-ribose binding, which is likely required for hydrolase activity, further reduces replication. percentage of survival was plotted by using Kaplan\u2013Meyer analysis. data were pooled from two independent experiments, ****P 0.0001; WT vs. nsP3 mutants. the Y114A mutant had less hydrolase activity but fivefold more ADP-ribose\u2013binding ability. the virulence of mutant CHIKV can be increased with stronger than WT ADP-ribose\u2013binding ability of nsP3. nsP3MD kinetics were slower than MacroD2 under the tested reaction conditions. both enzymes decreased the signal from 32P-MARylated PARP10CD by upwards of 40% within 10 min. 10% of the 32P signal remained even after the demodification was allowed to proceed for 2 h. biochemical and mutagenesis data have inferred that human and archaeal MAR hydrolases remove ADP-ribose groups from acidic residues. the specificity of viral MAR hydrolases has not been examined. nsP3MD used a phosphodiesterase-based MS approach to identify different amino acid ADP-ribosylation sites. nsP3MD is capable of removing MAR from modified aspartate and glutamate, but not lysine residues on PARP10CD. we mutated residues D10, G32, T111, G112, and R144 because of their broad distribution in the active site. mutations differentially affected the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3MD with R144A having little effect. mutant enzymes possessed 75% and 48% of MAR hydrolase activity in vitro. mutant enzymes possessed 75% and 48% of WT levels. nsP3MD mutants are defective in MAR hydrolase activity.

CHIKV nsP3MD is able to remove ADP-ribose groups from modified aspartate and glutamate, but not lysine residues. mutagenesis and biochemical data deduced that archaeal macrodomain Af1521 specifically removes ADP-ribosylation from a single protein. mutants with partially reduced nsP3 MAR hydrolase activity were attenuated for replication in cell culture and virulence in neonatal mice. nsP3 mutants lacking both binding and hydrolase activity were attenuated for replication in cell culture and virulence in neonatal mice. Y114A and G32S have comparable levels of MAR hydrolase activity. in vivo, mice infected with CHIKV Y114A had 75% mortality. in vivo, mice infected with CHIKV G32S had only 4% mortality. 1 g of PARP10CD was automodified with 0.5 Ci 32P NAD+ for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C in automodification buffer (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2,10 mM -mercaptoethanol). MARylated PARP10CD was incubated with equimolar amounts of macrodomain proteins for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C unless otherwise indicated. protein solution (1.4 mL) was loaded into the sample cell and titrated with 24 10-L injections after an initial 2-L injection of ligand. the heat evolved at 25 \u00b0C after each injection was obtained by integration of the calorimetric signal. the murine neuronal NSC-34 cell line was grown in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% (vol/vol) FBS, l-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL) at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. titers were determined by plaque assay in vero cells. 1 g of PARP10CD was automodified with 0.5 Ci 32P NAD+ for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C in automodification buffer (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2,10 mM -mercaptoethanol).
