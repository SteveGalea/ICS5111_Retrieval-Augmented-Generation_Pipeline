{"summary": "the only approved therapy, interferon and ribavirin, has limited efficacy. there is an international effort to develop new antiviral agents and vaccines that are effective across all major HCV genotypes. recent trials show a rapid appearance of drug-resistant viruses. anti-CD81 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can inhibit HCV infection at late times after virus internalization. there is limited evidence for tight-junction protein association with HCV. this may reflect an indirect role for these proteins in the virus internalization process. Huh-7.5 cells (Charles Rice, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY) (9), Huh-7 Lunet cells (Thomas Pietschmann; Twincore, Hanover, Germany) (7), and 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were propagated in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)\u20131% nonessential amino acids. anti-claudin-1 clone 421203 was purchased from R&D Systems. anti-tubulin clone T9026 was purchased from Sigma. species-specific secondary antibodies were used to detect colocalization of anti-receptor antibodies. the cells were seeded at 1.5 104 cells/cm2. the following day the medium was replaced with ice-cold 3% FBS-DMEM. at 0, 20, 60, and 120 min, the cells were incubated with 3% FBS-DMEM. the cells were seeded at 1.5 104 cells/cm2 and the following day serum starved for 60 min. the cells were washed and maintained at 4\u00b0C or transferred to 37\u00b0C for 60 min in the presence or absence of antibodies or viral pseudoparticles. the cells were probed for CD81, claudin-1, or tubulin expression by enhanced chemiluminescence (GeneFlow) densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software and the percentage of internalized CD81 or claudin-1 expressed at the cell surface. a single 1-m z-section across the cell center were selected for quantitation. cellular protein expression (arbitrary fluorescence units) was calculated by combining the number of fluorescent pixels and multiplying this value by the average intensity. the results are expressed as a percentage of the total fluorescence. naive Huh-7.5 cells were preincubated with Dynasore (80 M) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by anti-CD81 or Tfn-594 in the continued presence or absence of Dynasore. cells were serum starved overnight and then incubated with C3 transferase (Cytoskeleton) at 5 g/ml for 16 h. Huh-7.5 cells expressing AcGFP.CD81 were seeded at 1.5 104/cm2 on glass coverslips and incubated the following day with lentiviral pseudoparticles. the cells were fixed in EM-F using MAbs, intracellular CD81/claudin-1 imaged, and quantified as described above. anti-CD81 MAbs 2s66 and 2s131 were generated after immunization of mice with recombinant full-length CD81 (32). Purified mouse immunoglobulin was a gift from M. Goodall (University of Birmingham). anti-CD81 affinity for recombinant MBP-CD81 large extracellular loop (19) was assessed using the Biacore 3000 system (Biacore AB) mouse, goat anti-rabbit, and goat anti-rat immunoglobulins were obtained from Invitrogen. species-specific secondary antibodies were used to detect the colocalization of anti-receptor antibodies. cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) J6/JFH was generated as previously described. PK-treated cells were incubated with 3% FBS-DMEM to inactivate its activity. at 48 h postinfection, the cells were fixed, and the infectivity was quantified. the time taken for 50% of the virus (t1/2) to escape treatments was determined. the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Brij97, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium azide) the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Brij97, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl [pH 8.6] and biotin cleaved from surface- the cells were fixed in 3% FBS-DMEM\u20130.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37\u00b0C. the cells were counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. naive Huh-7.5 cells were preincubated with Dynasore (80 M) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by anti-CD81 or Tfn-594 in the continued presence or absence of Dynasore for the indicated time intervals. the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with fluorescence-labeled anti-CD81 2s66 and anti-claudin-1 labeled with the ATTO fluorophores 647N and 565 respectively. the following day, the cells were incubated with lentiviral pseudoparticles or HCVcc J6/JFH for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. anti-CD81 MAbs JS81 and 1.3.3.22 bind conformation-dependent epitopes in the large extracellular loop (LEL) the cells were fixed in EM-F using MAbs, intracellular CD81/claudin-1 imaged, and quantified as described above. the cells were removed by washing, and the medium was replenished with 3% FBS-DMEM for 48 h. HCV J6/JFH escaped the neutralizing activity of 2s66 and 2s131 at significantly later times than MAbs JS81 and 1.3.3.22 at 36 and 37 min, respectively. anti-CD81 MAbs neutralize HCV postinternalization and a role for endosomal CD81 in virus infection. saturating concentration of anti-CD81 MAbs JS81, 1.3.3.22, 2s66, or 2s131 was incubated for 60 min. surface-bound MAb was removed by low-pH treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized. intracellular CD81-MAb complexes were visualized by confocal microscopy. total CD81 representing the cell surface and intracellular pools was detected by permeabilizing the cells with 0.05% saponin postfixation. low-pH treatment of antibody-treated Huh-7.5 cells removed the cell surface-bound MAb and enabled the sole detection of intracellular antibody after the fixation. lane 1, biotin-labeled protein internalized at 4\u00b0C (lane 2), or biotin-labeled protein internalized at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of irrelevant mouse immunoglobulin (lane 3) or anti-CD81 2s66 (lane 4) (2 g/ml) was captured by streptavidin pulldown. antibody/biotin removal from the cell surface was incomplete. initial experiments showed that a 1-h treatment with MAb 2s66 increased intracellular localization of AcGFP.CD81 by 16.8%. HCV has been reported to enter cells in a clathrin-dependent manner (8, 48) to assess the clathrin dependency of CD81 endocytosis, we transfected Huh-7.5 cells to express GFP or GFP-tagged transdominant mutants of Eps15 (EH29) both mutants reduced Alexa 594-labeled transferrin uptake confirming clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Huh-7.5 cells expressing GFP-control, GFP-EH29, or K44A-GFP were incubated with Alexa 594-labeled transferrin (Tfn-594) or anti-CD81 2s131 (2 g/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. intracellular transferrin and CD81-Ab fluorescence in 10 selected GFP-expressing cells was measured. Huh-7.5 cells were serum starved and incubated with Dynasore prior to infection with HCVcc J6/JFH, HCVpp-H77, or VSV-Gpp. infectivity is expressed relative to untreated control cells and represents the mean of three replicate infections. Huh-7.5 cells were incubated with inhibitors of Rho (C3 transferase) or Rac-1. inhibition of Rho significantly reduced antibody stimulated CD81 endocytosis. both inhibitors reduced HCVpp infection as previously published (11) the cells were fixed and permeabilized, and antibodies were visualized as described in the text. the intracellular antibody fluorescence of 20 cells is presented as a percentage of the total fluorescence the SEM, where each circle represents an individual cell. claudin-1 and claudin-1 coendocytosis are known to readily endocytose via stimulus-specific endocytic pathways. claudin-1 is known to readily endocytose via stimulus-specific endocytic pathways (67, 74) internalized CD81 and claudin-1, Huh-7.5 cells were transfected with a GFP-Rab5 marker. real-time imaging showed CD81- and claudin-1-containing vesicles trafficking to and colocalizing with Rab5 expressing early endosomes. anti-CD81-treated cells were incubated with anti-CD81 2s66 and anti-claudin-1 tagged with ATTO 647N and ATTO 565. the cells were washed, and real-time confocal imaging of a 1-m z-section through the center of the cell was performed over a period of 5 min. HCVcc promoted a significant increase in intracellular CD81 (21.4%) and claudin-1 (15.2%), resulting in pixel saturation that may underestimate CD81 endocytosis. we confirmed HCVcc stimulation of endogenous CD81 endocytosis by antibody detection. the infectivity was measured after 48 h by enumerating NS5A-expressing cells relative to the control. the cells were incubated with HCVcc or mock infected (control) for 1 h prior to fixation and antibody detection of CD81 in saponin-permeabilized cells. these data illustrate HCV envelope glycoprotein stimulated CD81 and claudin-1 endocytosis. claudin-1 (27.4%) endocytosis by surface biotinylation. the data were compared using a Student t test (**, P 0.01). anti-CD81 MAbs neutralize HCV infection after virus internalization. the majority of these reports have used the commercially available anti-CD81 MAbs JS81 and 1.3.3.22 that bind conformation-dependent epitopes in the large extracellular loop (29) anti-CD81 MAbs neutralize HCV postinternalization. time course of J6/JFH to escape 50% of neutralizing effects of PK and anti-CD81 MAbs (t1/2) was calculated relative to the maximum inhibition observed at 120 min. intracellular CD81-MAb complexes were visualized by confocal microscopy. greater amounts of intracellular 2s66 and 2s131 were detected compared to JS81 and 1.3.3.22. saponin permeabilization was required to visualize CD81 puncta and low pH treatment designed to remove cell surface-bound MAb had minimal effect on secondary antibody detection of intracellular CD81. nuclei were stained with DAPI, and single 1-m z-sections from the central region of the cell were obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy. antibody ligation promoted CD81 endocytosis, we surface labeled cells with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin on ice. incubation with anti-CD81 2s66 significantly stimulated CD81 endocytosis. the data are representative of two separate experiments from which the intracellular CD81 relative to total surface biotinylated CD81 is combined. the data were compared using a Student t test (**, P 0.01) increased detection of intracellular CD81 observed with MAbs 2s66 and 2s131 compared to JS81 and 1.3.3.22 (Fig. 2A) may reflect differences in binding affinity or epitope-specific effects of MAb ligation on CD81 trafficking. fected Huh-7.5 cells to express GFP or GFP-tagged transdominant mutants of Eps15 (EH29) both mutants reduced Alexa 594-labeled transferrin uptake. both mutants reduced clathrin-dependent endocytosis. intracellular transferrin and CD81-Ab fluorescence in 10 selected GFP-EH29- and K44A-GFP-expressing cells was measured. serum-starved Huh-7.5 cells were treated with Dynasore prior to incubation with Tfn-594 or 2s131 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. transferrin and CD81 internalization relative to control were compared using a nonparametric ANOVA. the tetraspanins CD63, CD151, and CD82 internalize by diverse cellular routes (41, 56, 71) however, CD81 does not contain this endocytic motif. both inhibitors reduced HCVpp infection as previously published (11). parental and Huh-7 Lunet cells transduced to express wild-type (wt) CD81 or a mutant lacking the C-terminal tail (CD81C) were stained for cell surface CD81 expression in the presence of 0.01% sodium azide. intracellular antibody fluorescence is presented as a percentage of the total fluorescence the SEM in a sample population of 20 cells. the cells were serum starved overnight and incubated with EGF or Erlotinib for 1 h at 37\u00b0C prior to incubation with anti-CD81 2s66 (2 g/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were fixed and permeabilized, and antibodies were visualized as described in the text. Huh-7.5 cells were incubated with anti-CD81 and anti-claudin-1 MAbs. surface-bound antibody was removed by a low pH treatment. the cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to the addition of a secondary antibody. claudin-1 expression is essential for CD81 endocytosis. no difference in anti-CD81 stimulated endocytosis in claudin-1 silenced cells. anti-CD81 and claudin-1 endocytosis regulated by claudin-1 expression per se. anti-CD81 2s66 and anti-claudin-1 were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were washed, and real-time confocal imaging of a 1-m z-section through the center of the cell was performed over a period of 5 min. globulin inhibited HCVcc infectivity and ablated the effect of virus on CD81 and claudin-1 internalization. after HCVcc treatment we observed 89% of intracellular CD81 colocalizing with claudin-1 internalized from the plasma membrane. the cells were incubated with HCVcc or mock infected for 1 h. the cells were imaged as described in the text. the intracellular antibody fluorescence was quantified as a percentage of the total fluorescence the SEM in a sample population of 10 cells. cells expressing AcGFP.CD81 were incubated with recombinant HCV soluble E2 glycoprotein (100 g/ml) (A) or Envpp (6 ng) or HCVpp particles (5 ng) (B) the cells were fixed and imaged as described in the text. anti-CD81 MAb JS81 induced a lateral movement to cell-cell contact areas in Huh-7 hepatoma cells in a Rho-dependent manner (11) we did not observe any evidence for antibody or virus promoting CD81 trafficking to cell-cell contacts; however, CD81 endocytosis was Rho dependent. dynamin is intrinsically linked to clathrin- and caveolin-dependent and -independent routes of endocytosis (28). the reported absence of Cav-1 in Huh-7 cells and the inhibitory effect of the Eps15 transdominant mutant (14, 68) suggest a role for dynamin in clathrin-dependent CD81 and HCV endocytosis. claudin-1 expression alone does not regulate CD81 endocytosis. both HCVpp and HCVcc preparations stimulated greater levels of CD81 and claudin-1 endocytosis than saturating levels of receptor specific MAbs. antiviral antibodies can neutralize infection by a variety of mechanisms. the internalization of anti-receptor antibodies and their fusion with vesicular virus-receptor complexes is qualitatively different from previous reports on intracellular targeting of infection by virus-specific antibodies to west Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and influenza virus A (20, 62, 64). a recent report by Krieger and coworkers demonstrated comparable times for HCV to escape anti-claudin-1. delay between HCV internalization and fusion suggests that HCV/CD81/claudin-1-containing vesicles may converge with other intracellular or endocytosed molecules prior to fusion of virus and endosomal membranes."}
