{"summary": "study aimed to compare topical anesthetic lignocaine, adrenaline, and tetracaine (LAT) with conventional lignocaine infiltration(LI) for repair of minor lacerations, for comfort of anesthetic administration, efficacy and adverse effects. minor lacerations form a good 10%\u201315% of emergency department attendances in Singapore. lignocaine base (4%), racemic adrenaline (epinephrine) HCl (0.182%) and tetracaine HCl (0.569%) is a formulation of lignocaine base (4%) and racemic adrenaline (epinephrine) HCl (0.182%). the dermographic profile is shown in Table 1 and the characteristics of the wounds are shown in Table 2. Characteristics of wounds For patients aged >1 to 18 years, consent was taken from the accompanying adult/parent. observers based pain scores on the pain experienced as the needle pierced the skin. the number of sutures needed to stitch the laceration were recorded. the wound was reviewed for infection, dehiscence, erythema, redness and loss of stitches. the length of the wounds was 3.1 cm (SE 0.31) for the LG group. the depth of the wounds was 0.5 cm (SE 0.07) and 0.7cm (SE 0.08) respectively (P=0.21) we did not manage to get any patients with trunk wounds during the study period. a difference in pain score between the 2 arms of treatment more than or equal to 2 is clinically significant. one study even used the adrenaline mixture on fingers in 5\u201318 year old children, with no ill effects of digital ischemia caused by the adrenaline component. lignocaine solution for infiltration is about 2.50 US dollars. many patients will be willing to pay more for the comfort of the needleless anesthetic technique with LAT gel. this is even more so for the parents of children whose kids have to undergo toilet and suturing of minor lacerations. adults and not confined to the pediatric age group. further studies with a larger sample size preferred."}
