{"summary": "the following fluids were used: isotonic saline (ISS; Doubutuyou seisyoku- V injection: Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.), acetated Ringer\u2019s (AR; Sakusan Ringer\u2019s- V injection: Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.) and acetated Ringer\u2019s with 5% dextrose (ARD; Prototype: Nippon Zenyaku all calves were clinically normal before the start of the experiment. a 14-gauge catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein of the conscious calves. the calves received 80 ml/kg of the designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr. blood samples were anaerobically collected in a heparinized 1-ml syringe from the left jugular vein. the tips of the syringes were capped after collection. all calves had ad libitum access to starter, hay and water throughout the study. analysis Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were analyzed in whole blood samples using an automatic analyzer. hematocrit (Hct), Hb and BE were measured using an automatic gas analyzer. changes in relative plasma volume (rPV) were calculated from Hb and Hct, using accepted formulas. a 14-gauge catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein of the conscious calves. the calves received 80 ml/kg of the designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr, resulting in a flow rate of 1.0 g/kg/hr. stein females and three crossbred (Holstein Japanese Black) males with a mean age of 9.6 3.1 days (range 5\u201314 days old) and a body weight of approximately 40.0 kg were enrolled in this clinical study. all calves had ad libitum access to starter, hay and water throughout the study. hematocrit (Hct), Hb and BE were measured using an automatic gas analyzer (i-STAT 1, Abbott Lab.) Changes in relative plasma volume (rPV) were calculated from Hb and Hct, using accepted formulas. the rPV of the ISS, AR and ARD groups increased steadily throughout the study period, reaching 124.7 14.2%, 136.3 18.2% and 120.9 8.0%, respectively, at the end of fluid infusion (=4 hr) no significant changes in BE measurements in any of the groups were observed in this study. the BHBA concentrations in the ISS, AR and ARD groups increased slightly. ARD infusion induced progressive and significant decreases in BHBA concentrations. plasma glucose concentrations in the ARD group decreased slightly, reaching 42.0 6.2 g/dl. t cough, jugular vein congestion, ptosis, salivation and arrhythmia were not observed during the experimental period in either group. clinical signs of impaired central nervous system function and consistency of the feces did not change significantly in either group during fluid infusion. the BE measurements in 8/8 calves in the AR group and 8/8 calves in the ARD group were slightly increased compared with the base values until the end of fluid infusion. however, these changes were not significant. in contrast, ARD infusion induced progressive and significant decreases in BHBA concentrations. the be measurements decreased significantly, from 5.9 1.5 to 9.1 3.8 mM (P0.001) the BHBA concentrations of all calves increased to >0.2 mM. clinical signs, such as moist cough, jugular vein congestion, ptosis, salivation and arrhythmia, were not observed during the experimental period in any group. the rPV of the ISS, AR and ARD groups increased steadily throughout the study period, reaching 124.7 14.2%, 136.3 18.2% and 120.9 8.0% respectively, at the end of fluid infusion (=4 hr) the rPV was found to be significantly increased from the base values (P0.05 by Dunnett\u2019s test) the sequential changes in rPV for the ISS, AR and ARD groups were not significantly different between the groups. the base values of plasma glucose in the ISS, AR and ARD groups were 50.0 21.7, 73.3 21.5 and 72.0 29.8 mg/dl. significant increases in plasma glucose concentrations were induced in calves receiving ARD. the eyes were sunken 4 to 8 mm into the orbit. there was no space observed between the eyelid and the eyeball until the end of fluid infusion in both groups. urination was observed in 3/8 calves in the AR group and 1/8 calves in the ARD group. ARD infusion induced progressive and significant decreases in BHBA concentrations. plasma glucose concentrations were induced in calves by ARD infusion. plasma potassium concentrations returned to 84.9 19.4 mg/dl 24 hr after fluid therapy. IV infusion of both AR and ARD was found to be effective in increasing plasma volume. however, only IV infusion of ARD prevented catabolism. ARD infusion may be beneficial for wasting diarrheic calves with dehydration and metabolic acidosis. a calf with a BE 15 mM is diagnosed with severe metabolic acidosis. the acidification procedure used in this study significantly decreased the BE, from 5.9 1.5 to 9.1 3.8 mM (P0.001). the cause of the decrease in BE in the ISS group could be the increased serum chloride levels. this suggests that ISS may be of limited usefulness in calves with metabolic acidosis. infection with C. parvum has been shown to induce severe villous atrophy in calves. absorption is impaired due to the loss of mature villous epithelial cells and their associated transporters. addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may lead to hyperglycemia."}
