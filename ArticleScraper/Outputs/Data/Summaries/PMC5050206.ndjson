{"summary": "drug disposition encompasses the processes of drug absorption into the bloodstream, drug metabolism into different chemicals (mainly in the liver and intestine), distribution of the various chemicals into different tissues, and removal of the chemicals from the body through excretion. a key goal of predictive medicine is to identify the DNA loci, termed quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which can predict the response to a given medication and its toxicity in a particular patient. the first five founders are classical Mus musculus domesticus subspecies. the last three are wild-derived strains representing the three Mus musculus subspecies. CC mice are genetically reproducible with balanced allele frequencies. CC population has been proven phenotypically diverse, the extent to which drug disposition varies across these strains is still unknown. the extent to which drug disposition can arise is the biotransformation of drugs in the liver. in such biotransformation, drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) catalyze the biochemical modification and transport of exogenous chemicals. eQTL analysis characterized the genetic control over expression of drug disposition enzymes or of the expression of particular transcript isoforms. using these predictions we compiled a network of connectivity between genomic loci and the metabolism of specific drugs. CC lines The Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mice were used as described elsewhere. RNA extraction, RNA-Seq library preparation, and sequencing The liver tissues were dissected and stored in sterilized tubes at 196\u00b0C (in liquid nitrogen) RNA quality was tested on a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent); in all samples, RNA Integrity number exceeded 7. a single gene was 59.9% (min = 49.6%, max = 69.5%), and among them, fragments aligned to just one isoform were 32.6% (min = 26.9%, max = 38.7%). the expression trait of a gene refers to either the overall expression (a total-expression trait) or the percentage of a specific isoform (an isoform-ratio trait) u i = - 1 ( r i * n + 1 ), where ui is the adjusted level of the trait in individual i, 1 (p) is the quantile function of the normal distribution with probability p. r i * is the rank of v i * among the n values v 1 *, v 2 *,..., v n * with ties resolved by the average rank. association score between a given expression trait and a given the association tests were applied to genes expressed in the liver (vM 2) and to a single isoform-ratio traits from each of these genes. the association tests were applied on 5950 total-expression traits and 4712 isoform-ratio traits. a proximal eQTL is defined as a nearby genome interval whose FDR is lower than 0.01 (based on 100 permutations) there are two types of proximal eQTLs: total-expression eQTLs that are associated with the expression level of total-expression traits. steps 1 and 2 produced a reference collection of drug-specific gene sets. the assignment of a gene to a particular set is based on either direct (step 1) or indirect (step 2) experimental evidence. in step 3 we removed genes that were not associated with a proximal eQTL. CC lines The Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse lines were used as described elsewhere (Iraqi et al., 2008; Durrant et al., 2011; Consortium, 2012). animals were housed on hardwood chip bedding in open top cages at the animal facility of Tel-Aviv University (TAU) under a 12-h light/dark cycle. RNA-Seq data was mapped and quantified using RSEM version 1.2.18 (Li and Dewey, 2011) with the mouse genome (UCSC, mm9, NCBI37) and annotation file (Ensembl version 37.67) the reference was created by the RSEM rsem-prepare-reference command, followed by calculation of the expression level of genes using the rsem-calculate-expression command. the maximum level of a trait, denoted vM, is max v i i = 1 n. the bin size of a trait is defined as max 0. 5, v M 200. let v i * be the rounded level of vi to the accuracy of bin size. k = 1 8 k g k, m i + m i + i, (1) where mi is the CC line of the i-th individual; gk,mi is the haplotype probability of the k-th founder. k is the genetic fixed effect of the k-th founder, m is the random effect of CC line m, and an error term i is assumed to be normally distributed N(0, 2). the association tests were applied on 5950 total-expression traits and 4712 isoform-ratio traits. the genotyping data was computationally validated using comparison with the polymorphic loci in the RNA-Seq data. the analysis was focused on proximal genome intervals. the higher the (absolute) founder effect on a certain eQTL target, the stronger the contribution of the DNA changes in the eQTL region of this founder strain. eQTL-drug connectivity map was generated in several steps. each set includes a group of genes that play a role in the metabolic reactions of a particular drug, based on direct experimental evidence. reads were aligned to the genome using tophat version 2.0.9 (Kim et al., 2013) with \u2013max-intron-length 20,000 (thus avoiding most cases of aligning the same fragment to two nearby genes) uniquely mapped reads were extracted by filtering out those readings carrying poor mapping quality ( 10). analysis is focused on proximal eQTLs, using a cutoff of 5 Mbp as evidence for cis regulatory variation. we used permutation to establish the null distribution of the association test statistics. at a permutation FDR of 0.01 we identified proximal eQTLs associated with the total expression of 365 genes and associated with the expression of 243 specific transcript isoforms. functionalization reactions by oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis. oxidation is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (Cyp2a/2c/2d/3a), alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (Adhfe1 and Aldh8a1/16a1), thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase (Glrx2) and FMO (Fmo1). the identified eQTL targets include CAR, a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of drug disposition enzymes. proximal eQTLs underlying the biotransformation of drugs in livers of the CC mouse population. hydropyrimidinase Dpys* chr15:39 Glucuronidase Gusb* chr5:130 Glyoxalase Glo1** chr17:32 Conjugation UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Ugt1a6a* chr1:92 Ugt1a6b** chr1:90*,92 Ugt1a10 chr1: we found 30 total-expression eQTLs and 15 isoform-ratio eQTLs. each set is a collection of enzymes that play a role in the biotransformation of one particular drug. by analyzing these sets we identified 63 drugs whose biotransformation is perturbed by at least one proximal eQTL. isoform-ratio eQTL (asterisk), total-expression eQTL (no asterisk), or both (two asterisks) eQTL-associated enzymes are shown as white rectangles; eQTLs are marked by blue diamonds; eQTL-associated enzymes are drawn with a blue border. inotecan to SN-38 (by members of the carboxylesterases [CES] family) and deactivation of SN-38 into SN-38G (by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [UGTs] and the glucuronidase families) some of the associated enzymes participate in the biotransformation of two or more drugs, highlighting potential regulatory variation. distinct drugs initiate different biotransformation pathways perturbed by distinct combinations of eQTLs. this strategy may provide a tailored drug-specific selection of CC lines that can be used to test adverse effects in pharmacogenetic studies. a substantial fraction of identified associations are a result of splicing variability. CC lines for a gene are selected because they carry the genetic information of founders. this leads to a major variation in the fraction of expression of at least one isoform. the selected CC lines should therefore show a distinct distribution of the spliced junctions. the widespread exon-skipping events observed in B6-carrying strains raise the possibility that these events reflect a higher level of expression in B6-carrying than in A/J-carrying strains. however, we observed the opposite effect, with a higher coverage level and a higher number of non-skipping splicing reads in the A/J-carrying individuals. the difference between the haplotypes can be attributed to an alternative location of the 5\u2032 start site or alternatively, to a haplotype-specific 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 RNA degradation. previously annotated isoforms do not fully explain the observed reads in the PWK and CAST CC lines. eQTL analyzed regulatory programs of ligand-activated transcription factors called nuclear receptors (NRs) chemical signals consist of exogenous drugs and xenobiotics, as well as endogenous small molecules such as steroid hormones and cholesterol. we found enrichment of targets in xenobiotics- and drug-activated NRs. eQTL targets were enriched with known targets of ROR, ROR, and PPAR. three chemical and drug-sensing nuclear receptors (NRs; orange nodes) and three lipid-sensing NRs (pink nodes) are shown together with their transcriptional regulation (edges) on eQTL-associated target genes (blue-border nodes) out of 46 NR-dependent eQTL targets, 16 targets are involved in the lipid- CC mice can therefore be used to investigate the relationships between these factors and their roles in the interaction between lipid metabolism and drugs and xenobiotics. we sequenced total RNA from the livers of 29 distinct CC lines (1\u20133 individuals per strain, 55 individuals in total; Table S1). 5950 total expression traits and 4712 isoform-ratio traits were highly variable across the CC mice. we tested the association of each trait separately against all polymorphisms. a genome-wide map indicates, as expected, that this analysis has no spurious trans-eQTL bands. eQTL-associated conjugation DMEs catalyze the transfer of various functional groups, including UDP-glucuronosyl, amino acid, N-acetyl, methyl and glutathione-S. oxidation is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (Cyp2a/2c/2d/3a), alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (Adhfe1 and Aldh8a1/16a1), eQTL targets include an ATP-binding cassette (Abcc6) and a solute-linked carrier (Slco1a1) Transcription regulation. identified eQTL targets include CAR, a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of drug disposition enzymes.

CC mice based on proximal eQTLs reflects drug toxicity and adverse effects in vivo. a more complete approach will require integration with additional genomic data, including proteomics, trans-acting polymorphic loci, and epigenetic data. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
