{"summary": "high CyPA expression correlates with poor outcome of patients with inflammatory diseases. CyPA regulates the infection and replication of several viruses affecting humans. HIV-1 Gag Promotion of both the formation and the infectivity of virions of HIV-1 5, 6 Homo-oligomeric a7 neuronal nicotinic receptor (nAChR) and type 3 serotonin receptor (5HT3R) Maturation of the homo-oligomeric receptor 7, 8 Collagen Acceleration of the folding of the procollagen I 9 Transferrin Acceleration of an initial stage in transferrin folding 10 Drosophila rh extracellular CyPA stimulates pro-inflammatory signals in endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) extracellular CyPA has a potent chemotactic effect on leukocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes. a significant decrease in the recruitment of inflammatory cells in ligated arteries of CyPA/ mice and significant increase in VSMC-Tg mice compared with WT mice. extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and Ki67+ cells were consistently decreased in CyPA/ mice after carotid ligation. extracellular CyPA contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the aneurysm site and the activation of MMPs that degrade the extracellular matrix. the interference with signaling pathways leading to CyPA may reveal a new strategy in the treatment of AAA. extracellular CyPA, as well as extracellular CyPA, influence LDL uptake by regulating the expression of scavenger receptors on the vessel wall. CyPA induces inflammation of EC by increasing adhesion molecule expression and decreasing eNOS expression. EC dysfunction, neointimal formation thereby accelerating vascular remodeling, AAA and atherosclerosis Cardiac diseases Inflammation triggered by oxidative stress is the cause of many human cardiac diseases. we evaluated the role of CyPA in Ang II\u2013induced cardiac hypertrophy. mice lacking CyPA showed significantly less Ang II\u2013induced cardiac hypertrophy. analysis of ligated arteries revealed that intimal area as well as medial and adventitial thickening were significantly lower in CyPA/ mice. there was a significant decrease in the recruitment of inflammatory cells in ligated arteries of CyPA/ mice and a significant increase in VSMC-Tg mice. Ang II caused the release of CyPA and the activation of metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) in VSMC derived from human AAA. extracellular CyPA contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the aneurysm site. CyPA decreases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression through kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) transcriptional repression in EC. third, CyPA is a key determinant for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-induced EC apoptosis. extracellular CyPA stimulates EC apoptosis, stimulates adhesion molecules. extracellular CyPA induces pro-inflammatory status in macrophages. these effects induce inflammation, EC dysfunction, neointimal formation. a proteomic analysis of high glucose-primed monocytes showed that CyPA expression is reduced in circulating monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. the levels of CyPA in plasma samples of patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease are higher in comparison with plasma obtained from healthy volunteers. CyPA is important for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. high serum CyPA levels were detected in chronic hepatitis B patients than in healthy individuals. CyPA was found to act as a chaperone for the nucleocapsid protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus. it was also reported to regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication through binding to the nucleocapsid protein and incorporation into particles. it was also shown that CyPA is required for the host IFN-I response in rotavirus (RV) infection of MA104 cells. c cells could recognize the newly synthesized HIV-1 CA domain and prompt an interferon type I (IFN-I) response through activation of IRF3.52. c cells could recognize the newly synthesized HIV-1 CA domain and then prompt an interferon type I (IFN-I) response. CyPA was found to act as a chaperone for the nucleocapsid protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) it was also reported to regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication through binding to the nucleocapsid protein and incorporation into particles. in small cell lung cancer, overexpressed CyPA stimulates cancer cell growth. overexpressed CyPA knockdown slows down cancer cell growth. overexpressed CyPA is involved in diverse pathological processes of cancer development. CyPA promotes cancer growth, metastasis and drug resistance. anti-cancer drugs, such as DAC and 5-FU, decrease CyPA expression. however, CyPA upregulation also decreases cisplatin-induced cell death. two non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, 5M2 and LC-103H, were grown as xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. CyPA knockdown cells yielded slower-growing tumors than the cells transfected with scrambled RNAi. this effect was confirmed by overexpressing CyPA in the small airway epithelial cell line, S1LEK3. treatment with anti-cancer drugs such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, celecoxib, and 5-fluorouracil decreases CyPA expression in cancer cells. anti-cancer drugs, such as DAC and 5-FU, decrease CyPA expression and thus block cancer progression. CyPA upregulation also decreases cisplatin-induced cell death. this suggests that CyPA knockdown may lead to drug resistance. this could lead to a bad outcome of chemotherapy. CyPA knockdown cells yielded slower-growing tumors than cells transfected with scrambled RNAi. large tumors were observed in the CyPA-overexpressing group. intra-tumor injection of Pgenesil-2-CypA-shRNA decreased tumor development in nude mice. a recent paper by Kayenda et al.86 illustrated that the CD147 receptor can influence amyloid- peptide levels. it has been shown that copper affects the secretion of CyPA. this mechanism is of particular relevance in the nervous system regulation. soluble fraction of spinal cords of ALS patients, thus may contribute to protein aggregate formation in ALS. many papers showed the contribution of CyPA in oxidative stress mediated-diseases. mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) can cause familial ALS. transgenic mice that have mutant human SOD1 (G93A) substitution used as a model for ALS. RA patients showed that macrophages of the synovial lining layer constitute the major source of CyPA. they showed that stimulation of monocytes with CyPA results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines. the increased expression of CD147 on neutrophils in RA may be responsible for CyPA-mediated neutrophil migration into the joints. a comparative proteome analysis was performed on protein extracts from human monocyte THP-1 cells stimulated with either Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) and from Lactobacillus plantarum LTA (pLTA) it is concluded that CyPA is a mediator in the pathophysiology of sepsis. CyPA expression was significantly elevated in gingival tissues as compared with healthy gingival tissues. the same authors also collected gingival tissues and peripheral blood from patients with moderate to severe periodontitis or healthy donors. csA binds both extracellular and intracellular CyPA and inhibits its PPIase activity. it blocks the translocation of nuclear factor from activated T cells from the cytosol to the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines. a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that these non-immunosuppressive analogs of CsA may have applications in multiple therapeutic areas. for example, Alisporivir (Debio 025) is the first-in-class CyPA inhibitor that recently initiated a phase III trial. another derivative of CsA, NIM811, has been shown to promise anti-inflammatory effects in different experimental models associated with inflammatory response. vascular remodeling,22 aortic aneurysm,32 atherosclerosis,36 cardiac hypertrophy,42 and ischemia/reperfusion injury are the most promising of the new ant-HCV agents. several studies suggested that high CyPA expression correlate with poor outcome of patients with inflammatory diseases. a number of mechanistic details are still unknown and await further studies."}
