{"summary": "SKEMPI 2.0 is a major update to our database of binding free energy changes upon mutation for structurally resolved protein\u2013protein interactions. this version contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations. SKEMPI is a manually curated database of mutations in structurally characterized protein\u2013protein interactions. the first release has been used as a basis for many further studies. SKEMPI has also been used to study human disease. t al., 2014), hotspot residues (e.g. Hwang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Melo et al., 2016; Simoes et al., 2017) and changes in binding energy (e.g. Barlow et al., 2018; Dehouck et al., 2013; Dourado and Flores, 2014; Lai et al., 2017; Li et some entries in SKEMPI 1.1 were found by checking references in the ASEdb and PINT databases. most of the new data in SKEMPI 2.0 was found by searching the literature, partly in tandem with the literature search for the more recent structural affinity benchmark. the data is collected, including the PDB file, the chains of the interacting subunits, the mutation, the wild-type and mutant affinities (KD, M), the reference, the names of the proteins, the temperature at which the experiment is performed (T, K), the experimental method used (an extension of the category scheme of Geng et al., 2016) gene et al., 2016 has corrected entries for five wild-type and four mutant affinities identified by Geng et al., 2016. SKEMPI 2.0 also provides data on the location of the mutated residues, the homology between interactions in the dataset and processed PDB files. the binding of dimeric myostatin to follistatin-like 3 must be created by tessellating the unit cell. some PDB files contain features that are not readily parsed by some software, such as residue insertion codes. some entries in SKEMPI 1.1 were found by checking references in the ASEdb and PINT databases. most of the new data in SKEMPI 2.0 was found by searching the literature, partly in tandem with the literature search for the more recent structural affinity benchmark. the nucleotide modulates the affinity of Ras with its effectors. the fragment in the crystal structure matched that for which affinities are reported. the data is collected, including the PDB file and the chains of the interacting subunits. the affinity reported in the \u201cwild-type\u201d column corresponds to that of the PDB file. the affinity of the former appears in the \u201cwild-type\u201d column and the latter in the \u201cmutant\u201d column. such cases are noted in the database. we corrected entries for five wild-type and four mutant affinities. the interactions often contain multiple copies of the interacting proteins in the unit cell or other chains irrelevant to the interaction. some PDB files contain features that are not readily parsed by some software, such as residue insertion codes or negative residue numbers. ies are classified as antibodies as they bind to the same site as cetuximab, 14.3.d is classified as TCR, even though it is only the chain, and its binding partner, enterotoxin C3, is classified as a pMHC. a cluster of shared and homologous interactions are present in the database. these relationships are noted in the database and may be useful for avoiding overfitting. pMHC-TCR interactions include exogenous viral peptides and gluten. protease interactions are mostly exogenous, arising from their inherent cross-reactivity due to the convergent evolution of their canonical inhibitory loop. systematic study of all possible mutations at selected sites in the turkey ovomucoid third domain and its inhibitory interactions with four proteases. substantial data also come from investigations into the inhibitory interactions of class A -lactamases from the groups of Gideon Schreiber (e.g. Reichmann et al., 2007) and Timothy Palzkill (e.g. Brown et al., 2013), cytokine receptor interactions. alanine scanning of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor from the group of Michael Ploug (Gardsvoll et al., 2006), studies of Ras effector interactions from the group of Christian Herrmann (e.g. Kiel et al., 2004), and investigations into the cognate and non-cognate recognition of Escherichia coli colicin DNase bacteriotoxins. these interactions tend to be around picomolar affinity and are at the upper limit of what can be detected, due to the time required to reach equilibrium. errors in these entries are typically large, while others may cause changes in affinity larger than seven orders of magnitude. for 704 pairs for which k off is available, 83% have log 10 ( k off) within 0.5. for the 62 pair with both H and S values, 61% have H within 3.0 kcal. mol 1 of each other and 58% have S within 10 cal. mol 1. K 1 of each other. of the 421 non-additive cycles, 151 show noticeable sign epistasis. 151 show noticeable sign epistasis, in which the sign of the effect of either the A or B mutation flips depending on the presence or absence of the background mutation. 38 of these correspond to mutations, which destabilize the complex in the presence of the background mutation, but stabilize in its absence. 113 correspond to mutations, which stabilize the complex in the mutant background but otherwise destabilize the complex. only eight cycles exhibit the more extreme reciprocal sign epistasis, which in six cases are where both single mutations are stabilizing. in SKEMPI, 45 triple mutant cubes can be made, with 10 coming from the same reference. for fourth order interactions, 14 examples exist within SKEMPI. no fifth or higher order interactions are present. almost three quarters of the data correspond to single point mutations. more than half of those are mutations to alanine. most single point mutations are located at the binding site. nodes indicate proteins, scaled by number of mutations of that protein and coloured according to category. ipso facto biases the data and means that there is no representation of \u201cfuzzy\u201d complexes in which a diffuse structural ensemble in the bound state prevents the formation of a resolvable crystal. antigens include exogenous viral peptides and gluten, as well as endogenous autoimmune and cancer peptides. protease interactions are mostly exogenous, arising from their inherent cross-reactivity due to the convergent evolution of their canonical inhibitory loop. ferons also from the Schreiber group (e.g. Roisman et al., 2001) and that of K. Christopher Garcia (Thomas et al., 2011), but also the study of the GM-CSF/GMR interaction from the group of Michael W. Parker (Broughton et al., 2016). other prominent sources of data are studies into hormone receptor interactions. around 60 mutants are very destabilizing, reducing binding energy by 8 kcal. mol 1 or more. these interactions tend to be around picomolar affinity and are at the upper limit of what can be detected. errors in these entries are typically large. the 30 most stabilizing mutations in the database ( G \u20135 kcal. mol 1 ) consist of the reverse mutation applied to these structures. these mutations are mostly single or double mutants, but include mutations to up to 27 residues of the non-cognate Colicin E2/Im9 complex. the most common instances are double mutant cycles, where affinities are available for the wild type, A, B and AB mutations. 53 involve at least one mutant for which binding was not observed. 235 involve mutations reported in the same reference. 293 non-additive cycles exhibit tighter binding in the double mutant than the sum of the single mutants (positive epistasis), while 273 correspond to double mutants which reduce binding by less than the sum of two single mutants which reduce binding (antagonistic positive). 151 cycles show noticeable sign epistasis, in which the sign of the effect of either the A or B mutation flips depending on the presence or absence of the background mutation. single mutations are stabilizing ( 0.2 kcal. mol 1 ) but the double mutant is destabilizing (>0.2 kcal. mol 1 ). the remaining two correspond to two destabilizing mutations (>0.2 kcal. mol 1 ). the types of substitutions that can give rise to extreme effects can be illustrated with the Mlc-IIB Glc interaction in E. coli (Nam et al., 2008) the database is accessible online at https://life.bsc.es/pid/skempi2/. the data can also be browsed online, ordered and searched by any field. other pages offer a summary of the data, an FAQ and help page."}
