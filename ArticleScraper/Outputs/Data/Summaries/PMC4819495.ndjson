{"summary": "the effects of macrocontext (national or international conditions or events) on individual factors in psychology are not a new one. the idea that dramatic changes in the global environment can have meaningful influence on individual psychology is not a new one. economic distress affected young people\u2019s wellbeing via its impact on parents\u2019 mood and parenting behavior. a review by Clark and Heath (2014) found dips in trends in happiness and social wellbeing, including trust and experiences of prosocial behavior in the united kingdom and the united states. Steinberg (2009, 2013) has highlighted convincing biological, behavioral, and neurological evidence to extend the definition of adolescence up to mid-20\u2019s. Steinberg noted that youth are now becoming financially and socially independent at later ages, and biological, with evidence of continued and significant brain plasticity well into the mid-20s. such a period is defined by the convergence of developmental tasks from multiple life domains (educational, occupational, social, family, romantic, and values) the particular danger of macroeconomic events, like the GFC, would be the potential to knock youth off a typical developmental track. a relatively short delay can have ongoing consequences for status attainment well into adulthood. multidomain Wellbeing Psychologists, economists, and sociologists have all been interested in the influence of both micro- and macrolevel conditions on wellbeing. a common thread across much of this research is general or aggregated wellbeing (e.g., life satisfaction). there is relatively little attention given to how such events might differentially affect multiple life domains. hypotheses Empirical research suggests economic conditions can lead to significant changes in wellbeing. this literature has tended to use cross-sectional studies without the ability to follow individuals over time. the nature of the LSAY datasets allows us to compare the influence of the GFC at two distinct ages. 17.14 (.01) 17.35 (.01) Male % 48.88 51.35 50.85 48.86 Indigenous % 2.93 3.37 2.08 2.93 Social class Salariat % 62.23 48.07 74.74 73.81 Intermediate % 28.34 34.28 12.58 12.68 Working class % 9.42 17.65 12.68 13.51 At age 18 21 18 21 18 21 18 21 High school years completed Year 12%.27 78.70 1.08 79. two cohorts did not go through the GFC during the time period covered in the study. birth cohorts 1981 (n = 9,738; ages covered 17\u201325) and 1984 (n = 9548; ages covered 17\u201326) the cohorts are named after the modal birth year. all cohorts used a two-stage sampling procedure. the primary sampling unit was schools, selected with probability proportional to size. a random sample of students was then selected from within each school. weights aim to provide unbiased estimates of the population consistently. sargent-Cox et al. (2011) made the case that the impact of the GFC on Australians, and particularly the psychological impact, should be dated to 2009. the impact of the GFC on Australia and the individuals in the study likely came later. when considering the influence of the GFC at age 19, we compare the 1990 cohort (as the exposed group) to the earlier 1987 cohort (as the nonexposed group); when considering the effect of the GFC at age 22, we compare only the 1987 cohort (as the exposed group) to the earlier 1984 cohort (as the nonexposed group); the closest earlier cohort at the same age serves as the nonexposed group (i.e., did not experience the GFC at age 19 or 21). participants in the exposed and nonexposed groups were matched exactly on exogenous demographic variables. participants were also matched on age in days and all wellbeing variables up to the year prior to the GFC. hypotheses were tested using equation 1. Y = + C O H O R T + P R E _ Y + e i, j 1 Here represented the effect of the wellbeing variable P R E _ Y before the GFC (age 18 for the 19 year-old comparison and 21 for the 22-year-old comparison) angrist and Pischke (2014) fitted two sets of models. the first was a basic DID model specified in Equation 2: Y = + C O H O R T + G F C + ( C O H O R T G F C ) + e t, i, j 2 Where is the first order estimate of cohort on the wellbeing variable Y. participants failed to complete a particular item within a given wave. imputation was achieved using a bootstrapped expectation maximization approach. four cohorts of the LSAY database were used. population weighted demographics for each cohort can be found in Table 1. Age and year of data collection. light gray = the year of the global financial crisis (GFC) this choice was selected by less than 1% of the sample on average and never more than 4% for any question in any wave. abbreviations will be used as follows: general (your life as a whole), living (your standard of living), home (your life at home), future (your future prospects), career (your career prospects), work (the work you do, at study, at home or in a job), money (the money you get each week), location (where you live), social (your social life), people two additional domains relating to the economy and the way in which the country is being run were excluded due to not being present at critical waves of the study. two additional domains relating to the economy and the way in which the country is being run were excluded due to not being present. analysis Age-period-cohort effects A long running concern in developmental psychology has been how to disentangle the effects of age, period, and cohort. it is these period effects, and in particular changes in wellbeing that occurred after 2009 that are the focus of the current research. in the current research we used a mixture of exact and approximate matching via a propensity score matching (PSM) approach. participants in the exposed and nonexposed groups were matched exactly on exogenous demographic variables (gender, state of residence, social class, and Indigenous status) the aim of PSM is to create samples of exposed and nonexposed individuals who are similar (or balanced) on a wide range of potentially biasing covariates. initial analysis consisted of modeling the relationship between the covariates and presence in either the exposed or nonexposed groups. a DID approach estimates the shift from parallel trends at the exposure point. the assumption is that this discontinuity in parallel trends provides an estimate of the effect of exposure to a given event. the model is used to explore the potential effect of a treatment in two or more contemporaneous groups. j relates to the primary sampling unit which was the school the individuals were in at the first wave of data collection. y = + C O H O R T + G F C + ( C O H O R T G F C ) + e t, i, j 3 In Equation 3 are included to relax the assumption of common trends, and allow for cohort specific linear trends. cohort effects are concerned with the shared experiences of those who grow up in a similar historical context, whereas period effects are concerned with the impact of particular events that occur at a given time in history. such research is limited by the requirement of having multiple cohorts of data that cover at least part of the life span. to account for this we consider age as fixed (e.g., age = period-cohort) participants in the exposed and nonexposed groups were matched exactly on exogenous demographic variables (gender, state of residence, social class, and Indigenous status) participants were also propensity matched on age in days and all wellbeing variables up to the year prior to the GFC. y = + C O H O R T + P R E _ Y + e i, j 1 Here represented the effect of the wellbeing variable P R E _ Y before the GFC (coded 1) is the parameter of interest. model is used to explore the potential effect of a treatment in two or more contemporaneous groups; one in which the treatment is present and one where it is not. the multiple cohorts of LSAY allow us to extend the logic of the DID approach to noncontemporaneous groups. missing data and survey design As noted above the LSAY database has a complex design. to account for this various complexities we provide clustered standard errors for individual observations nested within participants who were themselves nested within schools. confidence intervals, and an interactive graph are available from the paper website at https://pdparker.github.io/GFCweb/. a visual inspection of all the graphs suggested that the 1987 and 1990 cohorts had similar (or slightly higher) levels of wellbeing across domains than the earlier cohorts before the GFC. general.157 (.188,.125)*.161 (.213,.110)*.112 (.146,.079)*.097 (.158,.036)*.064 (.132,.004) Work.084 (.118,.049)*.077 (.140,.013)*.088 (.128,.049)*.066 (.142,.009).011 (.105,.083) Living standards.144 (.18 169,.078)*.124 (.160,.088)*.107 (.156,.057)*.016 (.084,.052) Social life.155 (.187,.123)*.165 (.213,.117)*.092 (.129,.055)*.081 (.130,.032)*.084 (.153,.015)* Home life.108 (.142,.074)*.106 (.152,.061) matching suggested that the 1990 and 1987 cohorts were very similar with only 3% of the 1,365 assessed terms indicating a prematching difference of greater than.20 of a standard deviation. after matching no term displayed a difference of greater than.12 standard deviation units. z tests suggested only satisfaction with living standards, independence, and social life had significantly larger effects at age 19 that 22. compared the 1990 cohort (who went through the GFC at age 19) to the 1987 cohort (who experienced the GFC at age 22) with the 1984 cohort. size of the GFC greater than.10.

(2006) suggested that a payment of $330 U.S. ($448 U.S. in 2009 dollars; all conversions done using Williamson, 2015) to the population in general may be sufficient to offset the effects of an economic recession on wellbeing the current article was concerned with whether the GFC had an effect on young people\u2019s wellbeing across multiple life domains. we focused on an age group that was undergoing developmental tasks at a critical period of life that has implications across the life span."}
