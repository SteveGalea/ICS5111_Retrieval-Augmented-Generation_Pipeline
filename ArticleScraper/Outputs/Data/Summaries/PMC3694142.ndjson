{"summary": "every year, 50,000 people in the united states become infected with HIV-1. one in every 20 adults live with HIV in sub-saharan africa. the need for a vaccine against HIV is of utmost importance in the management of the global HIV epidemic. a significant vaccine trial using human adenovirus-5 failed to result in protection of high-risk individuals from HIV infection. one of the major drawbacks of this system was the presence of pre-existing antibodies against the viral vector [10], necessitating the characterization of viral vectors with potential for use in HIV vaccine development. RABV and VSV are single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses of the family Rhabdoviridae. they have simple genomes that encode 5 genes \u2013 nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the large protein (L) they are immunogenic in mice and NHPs without any vector-induced pathogenicity. NDV is an avian paramyxovirus that naturally infects different avian species. the strains are classified into three categories according to their virulence in poultry, velogenic, mesogenic and lentogenic. the strains are widely used as live poultry vaccines against virulent (velogenic) strains of NDV. RABV-Gag is the RABV vector in which the RABV glycoprotein gene was exchanged with the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of VSV Indiana strain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of RABV-G. in this paper it is cited as RABV-Ig-Gag. VSV-Gag was generated from the VSV-M51R, which is attenuated due to the mutation in the matrix protein [29]\u2013[31]. the HIV-1 Gag in the VSV-Gag vector is codon optimized Gag. the codon-optimized Gag gene [18] was amplified by PCR using the primers 5\u2032GGGGTTAATTAAGCCACCATGGGCGTGAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGGTTAATTA supernatant was collected at the times indicated in the figure. cells were washed once with 1 ml PBS and then resuspended in lysis buffer. lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14.000 rpm. mice were euthanized 5 days after challenge, and spleens were harvested. mice were euthanized 5 days after challenge, and spleens were harvested. spleens were harvested for analysis of the cellular response. cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (BD-cytofix buffer, BD Biosciences) for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. cells were then stained for 30 minutes at room temperature in Perm/Wash Buffer. Statistical analysis All data were analyzed by Prism software (GraphPad, version 5.0d) one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test analysis was used where more than two groups were compared. characterization of this vector revealed lower levels of expression of Gag in the cells and supernatants of infected cells compared to RABV-Gag. the RABV glycoprotein gene was exchanged with the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of VSV Indiana strain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of RABV-G. in this paper it is cited as RABV-Ig-Gag. the PCR product was cleaved with Pac I and cloned into the Pac I site of the VSV B5R cDNA infectious clone described in [31] the correct orientation and sequence of the insert was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA and cDNA prepared by RT-PCR of the genome of the recovered virus. the correct orientation and sequence of the insert was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA and cDNA prepared by RT-PCR. the mice were primed intramuscularly (i.m.) with either 1106 foci forming units (ffu) of RABV-Gag (Day 0), 1106 ffu VSV-Gag (Day 0), or 5106 ffu NDV-Gag (on Day 0 and 6). for the challenge experiments, the mice were rested for 35 days after the prime and then boosted i.m. 1106 plaque forming units (pfu) of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (vP1287, ARRRP \u2013 cited as VV-Gag) in 300 L (n = 5 per group) mice were euthanized 5 days after challenge, and spleens were harvested for analysis of the recall response. 1106 splenocytes/ml were plated in 96-well plate in the presence of GolgiPlug and GolgiStop. for each mouse, two groups were analyzed; the antigen-stimulated group pulsed with 10ug/mL AMQMLKETI peptide. for each mouse, two groups were analyzed. RABV-Gag, RABV-IG-Gag (which expresses VSV-Indiana G instead of RABV G), VSV-Gag, or NDV-Gag. VERO cells were infected with BNSP-Gag, VSV-Gag, and p24 ELISA. anti-vector immunity in the boosting phase is typical of homologous prime/boost protocols. we immunized mice with RABV-Gag followed by a second immunization with RABV-IG-Gag. the initial NDV infection does not prevent a second immunization by vector-specific antibodies. mice were primed intramuscularly with VSV-Gag. each point is representative of splenocytes from one mouse. mice were primed with NDV-Gag followed by heterologous immunizations with VSV-Gag or RABV-Gag. mice mock-immunized with PBS were included as a negative control. 5 days after boost, mice were euthanized and spleens harvested. homologous responses with NDV-Gag were lower than RABV-Gag or VSV-Gag. mice were primed intramuscularly on Day 0 and 6. 35 days later the mice were boosted. Statistical analysis was performed using one-WayANOVA. results shown are the mean. p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, ****p0.0001. mice were primed intramuscularly and 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis. mice were primed intramuscularly 33 days after prime. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis of the cellular response. mice were primed intramuscularly on Day 0 and 6. 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis of the cellular response. boosting twice with NDV-Gag induced the highest amounts of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. VERO cells were infected at a MOI of 5 with BNSP-Gag, VSV-Gag, and NDV-Gag. p24 antigen was measured by ELISA. we immunized mice with RABV-Gag followed by a second immunization with RABV-IG-Gag (which expresses VSV-Indiana G), VSV-Gag, or NDV-Gag. the initial NDV infection does not prevent a second immunization by vector-specific antibodies. mice were primed intramuscularly. each point is representative of splenocytes from one mouse (n = 5 per group) mice were primed intramuscularly and 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis of the cellular response. homologous responses with NDV-Gag were lower than RABV-Gag or VSV-Gag. IFN- and TNF- expression in mice that were primed and boosted with NDV-Gag were lower than those that were not boosted. mice primed with RABV-Gag followed by heterologous immunizations with the other vectors were challenged with VV-Gag. differences between NDV-Gag and VSV-Gag in IFN-+ cells were statistically significant. differences in percentage of IFN-+ (p0.0001) and TNF-+ (p0.05) cells were evident when comparing boosted group responses to those from animals that received RABV-Gag prime only. mice were primed intramuscularly and 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were primed intramuscularly and 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis of cellular response. mice were primed intramuscularly on Day 0 and 6. 35 days later the mice were boosted. mice were euthanized and spleens harvested for analysis of the cellular response. prime induced HIV-1 Gag specific immune responses that were higher than responses in mice primed with RABV-Gag and NDV-Gag. boosting twice with NDV-Gag induced the highest amounts of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. a vaccine against HIV is critically needed. responses in mice primed with RABV-Gag (Figure 2) and VSV-Gag (Figure 3) were applied. in previous studies, RABV-IG-Gag was also able to boost responses to RABV-Gag. on the other hand, VSV-Gag induced the higher CD8+ T cell response. RABV expressing codon optimized Gag on the other hand did not express higher levels of Gag in the cell lysate or supernatant. the expression levels of Gag and RABV-N were lower when using codon-optimized Gag compared to the wild-type vector. one possible explanation is that codon optimization leads to differences in viral replication and transcription in the case of RABV. the immune responses were determined by analyzing expression of IFN- and TNF-. other cytokines analyzed included IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10. however, the levels of expression of these latter cytokines compared to background were too low and therefore not included. the number of activated HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage of cells in the spleen is shown."}
