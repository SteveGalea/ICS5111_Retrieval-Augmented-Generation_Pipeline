{"summary": "a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method for rapid detection of IBRV was developed. the clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. the detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA. this assay may be the potential candidate for point-of-care diagnostics in the field."}
