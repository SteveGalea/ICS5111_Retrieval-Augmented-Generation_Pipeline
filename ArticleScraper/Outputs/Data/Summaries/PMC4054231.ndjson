{"summary": "TEXT Astroviruses were first discovered in humans in 1975. they consist of eight closely related serotypes responsible for about 10% of sporadic nonbacterial diarrhea in children. 90% of the general population has antibodies to serotype 1 and only 10% has antibodies to serotype 7 (1). open reading frames 2 (capsid protein) of MLB1, MLB2, and MLB3 were synthesized and injected into rabbits to produce antibodies DW57 and DW58. astrovirus serotype 1 capsid protein was produced as previously described. an N-terminal His tag was added to the previous construct. a Western blot assay showed baculovirus-expressed his-tagged MLB1 and MLB2 capsid proteins. a Western blot assay gave signals of approximately the expected size. the ages of the subjects and numbers of sera were as follows: 0 to 6 months, n = 22; 7 to 11 months, n = 23; 12 to 23 months, n = 35; 2 years, n = 13; 3 years, n = 20; 4 to 6 years, n = 47; 7 to 17 years, n = 75; 18 to 32 years, n = 38; 33 to 64 years, n = 42; and >65 years, n = 80. preimmune rabbit serum and MLB1 peptide antibody were analyzed on every ELISA plate. the coefficient of variance for the preimmune rabbit serum was 14.80% (MLB1) and that for the positive control was 26.17% (MLB1) in a cohort of healthy vaccine trial participants, the overall seropositivity of MLB1 was 86.6% (342/395). samples were preincubated with each protein individually prior to the ELISA. the positive controls were polyclonal MLB1 peptide antibody (DW60) from each plate. 89.4% of the cohort was positive in this assay. however, preincubation experiments done on 20 samples showed significant levels of cross-reaction with MLB1 (50% of samples) and MLB3 (20% of samples) this type of one-way cross-reactivity has been described for other viruses. canonical human astrovirus serotypes 1 to 8 may have other pathogenic potential in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or elsewhere. a distinct novel astrovirus has been reported in brain tissue of an immunocompromised patient with encephalitis (14)"}
