{"summary": "poxvirus species capable of infecting humans include variola virus, which causes smallpox and is one of the most destructive pathogens in human history. the number of zoonotic infections is predicted to rise, due to waning population immunity. vaccinia virus strains are used as model viruses to study the unique life cycle of poxviruses (14) gene transcripts mediate virus core uncoating and DNA replication. poxvirus replication is located outside the cellular nucleus in specialized compartments known as viral factories. haploid genetic screen identifies host factors involved in MVA infection. the strongest outliers were host factors that directly affect HepS chain formation, including XYLT2, B4GALT7, B3GALT6, B3GAT3, EXTL3, EXT1, EXT2, HS2ST1, and NDST1. other host factors affecting HepS transport and biosynthesis of HepS precursor molecules were also enriched in the screen. mindbomb protein 1 (MIB1) was selected as a hit that was already significantly enriched in wild-type HAP1 cells. up to five guide RNAs per gene were selected and coexpressed with Cas9 in the human melanoma cell line MelJuSo (MJS) control gRNAs were expressed that target TAP1, TAP2, or B2M, which have no known role in primary poxvirus infection. gRNAs were infected with MVA-eGFP (MOI, 50) after 7 days, cells were harvested and quantified by flow cytometry. survival from MVA exposure may be due to resistance to virus-induced cell death or resistance to primary virus infection. TM9SF2 appeared as a hit in a haploid screen for HepS surface expression (21) and was more recently identified as a crucial factor for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 localization and functioning (28). we tested the effect of the gRNAs on HepS surface expression in the same clones. TMED10 gRNA-expressing HeLa and MJS cells were cloned and tested for TMED10 expression by immunoblotting. this suggests that TMED10 is essential in HeLa but not in MJS cells. the knockdown clones we established in HeLa cells displayed a decreased growth rate. wild-type MJS cells or clones indicated in panel A were infected with VACV-eGFP. percentage of infected (eGFP positive) cells was quantified by flow cytometry. to measure early promoter activity, eGFP expression was evaluated 5 h after infection. late gene expression was affected to similar levels as early gene expression. a similar reduction in early and late gene expression was also observed in MJS EXT1 clone 1. the phenotype was caused by off-targeting effects of the two TMED10 gRNAs. the cDNA was reintroduced in the MJS TMED10 KO clones by means of lentiviral transduction. TMED10 may affect vaccinia virus infection before the onset of early gene expression. the role of TMED10 in the formation of virus-induced blebs was investigated by incubating control cells and TMED10 KO cells with VACV-WR for 45 min. blebbing was readily observed on the surfaces of virus-exposed cells, while blebs were absent in uninfected cells. reintroduction of TMED10 restored blebbing in these cells. these LUVs are similar in size (150 to 200 nm in diameter) to vaccinia viruses. their uptake in cells can be assessed, as intracellular LUV release results in the formation of a bright fluorescence signal. as for VACV, the concentration-dependent uptake of LUVs is dependent on serum factors and PS in the membrane. cell surface expression of Axl was highly reduced on cells lacking TMED10. expression was restored upon reconstitution of TMED10. TMED10 affects virus-associated membrane blebbing and subsequent uptake of virus-like particles by targeting the PS-induced macropinocytosis pathway. haploid genetic screen identifies host factors for MVA infection. a total of 1 108 HAP1 cells were mutagenized using a gene trap retrovirus and subsequently infected with MVA. the strongest outliers were host factors that directly affect HepS chain formation. gene-trap insertions are plotted on the y axis. total number of insertions in a particular gene is plotted on the x axis. other significant hits did not cluster with other genes for functional relationship. four of the five gRNAs targeting EXT1 and TM9SF2 conferred robust protection against MVA-induced cell death. only one gRNA targeting SACM1L and no gRNAs targeting MIB1 conferred robust protection against MVA infection. survival from MVA exposure may be due to resistance to virus-induced cell death or resistance to primary virus infection. primary infection was reduced more than 70% in four of five gRNA clones. more than 60% in four of eleven TM9SF2 gRNA clones. efficiency of MVA infection depends on HepS surface levels. we tested the effect of the EXT1 and TM9SF2 gRNAs on HepS surface expression in the same clones presented in Fig. 3A. clones that were resistant to primary MVA infection displayed unaltered HepS surface levels. cells expressing Cas9 only or coexpressing TMED10#1 or TMED10#5 were cloned. transferrin receptor and TMED10 levels were assessed by immunoblotting. the immunoblot is representative of three independent experiments. the percentage of infected (eGFP positive) cells indicated in panel D was quantified by flow cytometry 5 h after infection. the role of TMED10 in primary infection was tested by infecting MJS TMED10 knockout clones with two recombinant MVA strains that express eGFP during infection controlled by either an early/late or late promoter. a virus strain, MJS cells were infected with vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACV-WR) expressing eGFP from an early/late promoter (VACV-eGFP) five hours after inoculation, VACV-eGFP infection was significantly more abrogated than the infection with MVA. despite incomplete removal of TMED10 protein from these cells, infection was again highly reduced at both MOIs tested. the more pronounced effect of TMED10 on VACV-eGFP infection than on MVA infection may result from the differences in entry pathways that both viruses use. blebbing was readily observed on the surfaces of virus-exposed cells, whereas blebs were absent in uninfected cells. the role of TMED10 in macropinocytosis was further demonstrated using large unilamellar membrane vesicles (LUVs) these LUVs are similar in size (150 to 200 nm in diameter) to vaccinia viruses and can be taken up by cells via macropinocytosis. down HeLa cells and TMED10 KO MJS cells, LUV uptake was highly reduced. the uptake of dextran beads was stimulated by VACV binding to the cell membrane. TMED10 expression had no effect on dextran uptake, indicating that TMED10 specifically affects PS-dependent macropinocytosis. uptake (3 M) in the presence or absence of serum; 4 LUVs (3 M) composed of PC only or PC and PS. cells were harvested and fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. screening approaches using replication-competent vaccinia viruses may elucidate more of these factors. haploid screen using replication-competent vaccinia viruses also recovered host factors mostly involved in virus attachment and entry. this is based on resistance to virus-induced cell death and thus does not account for selection of genes mediating virus production and spread. haploid genetic screens performed for other viruses that (partly) depend on HepS for host cell attachment. other genes that were enriched in these screens included TM9SF2 and prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat containing 1 (PTAR1) reticulum (ER) localizes to the plasma membrane independently of COPI (56) and could thus interact directly with VACV particles. TMED10 shuttles its binding partners into the ER, thereby decreasing their cell surface expression. viruses benefit from the dampening effect of TAM receptor-induced macropinocytosis on the immune system (63, 64), which is mediated by an array of anti-inflammatory cytokines (32, 65, 66). the human melanoma cell line MelJuSo (MJS) and T2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. retroviral insertion sites were amplified using a linear amplification-mediated PCR and deep sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000) gene trap cassette was designed unidirectionally, genes functioning as MVA host factors would be predicted to be enriched for disruptive orientation insertions (22) the crRNA target sequences for each of the targeted genes were designed using an online CRISPR design tool (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources; Zhang lab, MIT) the crRNA target sequences for each of the targeted genes were selected and cloned into the pSicoR-CRISPR-PuroR vector using Gibson assembly (NEB) a gBLOCK containing the sequence of human TMED10 was introduced into a dual promoter lentiviral vector coexpressing ZeoR. lentiviruses were produced in HEK-293T cells in a 24-well-plate format using standard lentivirus production protocols. 2 104 cells/well were seeded in a 48-well plate and infected the following day with the virus strains at the MOIs indicated in Results and figure legends. cells were harvested 5 h after infection with VACV-eGFP and MVA-eGFP. cells were harvested 20 h after infection with MVA eGFP. cells were washed twice with PBA, and fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. for Axl surface expression, cells were harvested using trypsin. lysates were centrifuged for at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. 0.5 105 cells were incubated with VACV-WR (MOI, 20) in ice-cold complete medium. cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 10% FCS and fixed in PBS supplemented with 4% formaldehyde. slides were incubated with CytoPainter phalloidin-iFluor 488 (Abcam) to stain actin filaments and TO-PRO-3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to stain the nuclear DNA. slides were washed and mounted on a microscope slide using a leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. calcein was separated from calcein-filled LUVs using size exclusion column chromatography. phospholipid content of lipid stock solutions and vesicle preparations was determined as inorganic phosphate. cells were seeded in a 48-well plate using 5 104 cells per well. cells were harvested in ice-cold complete medium and washed twice using ice-cold PBS. cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. all viruses were amplified, purified (sucrose cushion) and titrated according to standard methodology (67). retroviral insertion sites were amplified using a linear amplification-mediated PCR. genes functioning as MVA host factors would be predicted to be enriched for disruptive orientation insertions (22) as tested by a binomial test.
