{"summary": "avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) is caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the femoral head or the pathological process of osteoblast death (1,2) it occurs following the long-term use of adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH) or the use of high doses of ACTHs (3\u20135) the major clinical characteristics of ANFH include hip pain, limited mobility, lameness and a high disability rate. deer antlers may have preventive and therapeutic effects on osteoporosis. but there have been few papers investigating the therapeutic effect of deer antler extracts on femoral head necrosis. ture deer antlers were obtained from Beijing Tong Ren Tang Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., (Beijing, China) a total of 200 g antler was dried, milled and sliced, and then extracted 4 times by dissolving in 1 l distilled water and boiling for 5 h. the liquid containing the extract was concentrated at 20% by boiling for 5 h and stored at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. rabbits were intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of saline. 200,000 U penicillin was injected into the buttock of each rabbit. the femoral head was separated and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde. all rabbits were anesthetized with a combination of xylazine and ketamine. blood was collected from the ear vein in EDTA tubes and centrifuged. primary osteoblasts were obtained from newborn rabbit calvarias. tissue digested with trypsin 3 times and incubated with type I collagenase. tissue was then cut into pieces 0.5 mm3 and placed on inner surface of dish. Western blotting Total proteins from the femoral head tissue or the cells treated with antler serum were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. a total of 75 g protein was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck KGaA) the membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 25 a total of 980 l (blank) and 960 l (test and control) of reaction buffer was pipetted into cuvettes. 20 l of 0.67 M pNPP solution was added to each cuvette. 20 l of diluted ALP solution was added to each cuvette. a total of 200 g antler was dried, milled and sliced, and then extracted 4 times. the liquid containing the extract was concentrated at 20% by boiling for 5 h and stored at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. rabbits were housed in an animal chamber maintained at 222\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 505%. methylprednisolone (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) twice a week, over a 2-week period. 200,000 U penicillin was injected into the buttock of each rabbit. after 2 weeks, 1 rabbit in each group was randomly selected to confirm whether the SANFH model was successfully established. all rabbits were anesthetized with a combination of xylazine and ketamine. blood was collected from the ear vein and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and 5,000 g to separate serum. primary osteoblasts were obtained from newborn rabbit calvarias. tissue digested with trypsin 3 times and incubated with type I collagenase and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in Hank's buffer solution. tissue was then cut into pieces 0.5 mm3 and placed on inner surface of dish to release cells. western blotting Total proteins from the femoral head tissue or the cells treated with antler serum were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) a total of 75 g protein was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with a 10% separating gel and 5% stocking gel. 960 l (test and control) of reaction buffer was pipetted into cuvettes. 20 l of 0.67 M pNPP solution was added to each cuvette. 20 l of diluted ALP solution was added to each cuvette. a total of 200 g antler was dried, milled and sliced, and then extracted 4 times by dissolving in 1 l distilled water. the liquid containing the antler extract was concentrated at 20% by boiling for 5 h and stored at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. rabbits were housed in an animal chamber maintained at 222\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 505%. rabbits were intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of saline. 200,000 U penicillin was injected into the buttock of each rabbit. femoral head was separated and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight. all rabbits were anesthetized with a combination of xylazine (6 mg/kg) and ketamine (40 mg/kg; both Seebio Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) blood was collected from the ear vein in EDTA tubes and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C.
