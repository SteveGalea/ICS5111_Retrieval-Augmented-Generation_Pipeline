{"summary": "Cyclophilin (CyP) and FK506 binding protein (FKBP) are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), enzymes that catalyze cis-trans interconversion of peptide bonds amino terminal to proline residues. the action of PPIases leads to changes in protein conformation (Takahashi, 1999), but the binding of CsA and FK506 to CyP and F CN dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NF-AT, leading to NF-AT nuclear translocation and transactivation of downstream genes. members of the CyP family play roles in a variety of cellular processes including the immune response, transcription, mitochondrial function, cell death, and chemotaxis. aa NM_004792 Nestel et al. 1996 CyPH, USA-CyP, SnuCyP-20 177 aa NM_006347 Horowitz et al. 1997 PPI-L1 166 aa NM_016059 Ozaki et al. 1996 PPI-L3 165 aa NM_032472 Zhou et al. 2001 PPI-L4 492 aa CyPA interacts with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and promotes AIF-mediated chromatinolysis during apoptosis. other studies have reported several non-immune system roles for CyPA. CAML is located on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. it participates in calcium signal transduction pathway and it is essential for peripheral T cell development. the importance of CyPB binding to CAML function remains unknown. ischemia-induced necrosis triggers the opening of a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane. calcium overload and ROS induce a conformational change in adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), a key component regulating the opening of MPTP at the inner mitochondrial membrane. apoptotic cell death induced by cytokines or anti-cancer agents was unaffected. s including the glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor exert transcriptional activity following steroid ligand binding and nuclear translocation. SRs form complexes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) together with immunophilins CyP40, FKBP51, or FKBP52 in the cytoplasm. these immunophilins control SR activity by increasing receptor avidity for hormone ligands through PPIa CyPA is incorporated into viral particles and is located in the viral core. the functional role of CyPA in the viral life cycle appears to be strain-dependent. relocalizes to the peripheral region of the nucleus, colocalizing with sites of virus production. the functional role of CyPA in the viral life cycle appears to be strain-dependent. the authors suggest differential requirements of CyPA are likely the results of evolutionary pressure during lineage development. CyPA is incorporated into virions through binding to the CA domain of the Gag polyprotein. target cell expressed CyPA is important for productive infection and viral replication. TRIM5 is a host restriction factor originally identified using expression cloning. both the mechanism of TRIM5 restriction of HIV-1 and the modulation of CA recognition by CyPA remain unclear. CyPA interacts with CD147 (Pushkarsky et al. 2001), heparans (Saphire et al. 1999), Vpr (Zander et al. 2003), and envelope glycoprotein gp120. small molecule compounds targeting NS3 and NS5B have been developed. host cell factors are required for viral replication. hVAP-33 is one of SNARE family proteins that regulate vesicle biogenesis. CsA inhibits HCV genome replication as potently as IFN. cellular treatment with 1 g/ml CsA decreases HCV RNA levels by approximately 1/500. differences between CsA and FK506 suggest that CsA prevents viral genome replication independently of CN. the expression of HCV NS5A and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) as a cellular protein was examined in the HCV replicon-bearing cells treated without (control) or with 100 IU/ml IFN, 1_ g/ml CsA, or 1_ g/ml FK506 for 7 days. inhibition of CyP activity is essential for the anti-HCV effect of CsA. CyPB regulates the activity of NS5B. in the absence of CsA, NS5B associates with cellular CyPB to efficiently bind to the HCV genome RNA and drive genome replication. small molecule compounds targeting NS3 and NS5B have been developed. hVAP-33 is one of SNARE family proteins that regulate vesicle biogenesis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion. however, only a limited number of host proteins have been found to be involved in HCV genome replication with biological relevance. we identified CsA as an anti-HCV agent using a HCV replicon system. CsA inhibits HCV genome replication as potently as IFN. differences between CsA and FK506 suggest that CsA prevents viral genome replication independently of CN. expression of HCV NS5A and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) as a cellular protein was examined in the HCV replicon-bearing cells treated without (control) or with 100 IU/ml IFN, 1_ g/ml CsA, or 1_ g/ml FK506 for 7 days. inhibition of CyP activity is essential for the anti-HCV effect of CsA. CyPB regulates the activity of NS5B. in the absence of CsA, NS5B associates with cellular CyPB to efficiently bind to the HCV genome RNA and drive genome replication. treatment of NIM811 for three weeks eliminated HCV RNA from host cells to under detectable level. non-immunosuppressive variants of CsA that inhibit CyP activity may offer great promise for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection."}
