{"summary": "study based on extensive studies in the mouse of the role of CSF1 in monocyte-macrophage production and differentiation and the function of macrophages in the control of hepatocyte proliferation. we use a novel form of CSF1 to demonstrate that the findings in mice can be extended to large animals. acute liver failure in human patients is associated with loss of clearance functions. pigs have been used increasingly as models of human disease (17) pigs are a major livestock species. large white pigs 8.5 wk of age from one litter were used. four days prior to first injection each pig was weighed. pigs were injected intramuscularly once a day for 3 days. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were retrieved and red cells were removed with cell lysis buffer (BioLegend) all isolated cells were suspended in PBS prior to counting and cryopreservation. cells were washed, pelleted, resuspended in blocking buffer. an aliquot of blood from ACD blood collection bags was analyzed for complete blood cell counts. total white blood cell (WBC) was measured by making a blood smear counterstained with Giemsa stain. tissues were processed overnight using an Excelsior tissue processor. sections were embedded in paraffin wax prior to 4-m sections cut. sections were stained with H&E or immunohistochemistry. ous peroxidase activity was blocked using dako REAL peroxidase blocker (Dako S202386) for 10 min. sections were incubated for 60 min using rabbit anti-human Ki67 (AbCam AB15580) for 30 min. large white pigs 8.5 wk of age from one litter were used. four days prior to first injection each pig was weighed. pigs were injected subcutaneously once a day for a total of 3 days. Pig bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the bone marrow from ribs with RPMI/5 mM EDTA followed by removal of red cells with cell lysis buffer. cells were washed, pelleted, resuspended in blocking buffer (PBS/2% heat inactivated FCS), transferred to a 96-well plate (V-bottom) and incubated on ice for 15\u201320 min. aliquot of blood from ACD blood collection bags was analyzed for complete blood cell counts. total white blood cell (WBC) was measured by making a blood smear counterstained with Giemsa stain. sections were embedded in paraffin wax prior to 4-m sections cut. slides were dried overnight at 37\u00b0C before 60\u00b0C for 25 min. antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer. reagent ImmPRESS HRP anti-rabbit IgG (Peroxidase Polymer; VectorMP-7401) for 30 min followed by DAB (Newmarket Scientific Monosan Dab substrate kit cat. no. CO7-25) results are presented as treatment group means SE. pigs were injected intramuscularly once a day for a total of 3 days. the appropriate volume of CSF1-Fc (0.75 mg/kg; n = 6) or PBS vehicle (n = 5) pigs were injected intramuscularly for a total of 3 days. cells were washed, pelleted, resuspended in blocking buffer (PBS/2% heat inactivated FCS), transferred to a 96-well plate (V-bottom) and incubated on ice for 15\u201320 min. samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C in the dark for 30 min before being washed two times with 200 l PBS. IgG1 AbD Serotec, MCA5951F 1:100 AbD Serotec, MCA928F Antigen Conjugate Isotype Supplier Concentration Secondary Antibody CSF1R Purified IgG2a Produced in-house 5 g/ml Biolegend, 405308, 1:400 dilution Summary information for all monoclonal antibodies used for flow cytometry staining. antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer. nonspecific protein binding was blocked using 2.5% goat serum (Vector Laboratories) for 10 min. data were analyzed by t-tests using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). a P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. an equivalent dose of IgG1 (10\u201320 mg depending on the size of the pig) would have no impact on plasma IgG concentration (15\u201330 mg/ml) hepatosplenomegaly doubled the spleen/body weight ratio and increased the liver/body weight ratio by 40% after only 4 days. pig blood monocytes can also be separated into subsets based on expression of surface markers. expression of various markers by peripheral blood monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry staining (Fig. 2). the ability of CSF1-Fc to promote monocytosis was associated with expansion of progenitor pools in the marrow. a key population of macrophages in bone marrow forms the center of hemopoietic islands. a key population of macrophages in bone marrow forms the center of hemopoietic islands. Pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. BM from ribs was collected as described in materials and methods. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. sections of liver were stained for the proliferative cell marker Ki67. pig livers were large and round, consistent with identity as hepatocytes. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. treatment with CSF1-Fc in pigs produced a small but significant increase in the mean villus length of the mid jejunum but had no detectable effect in the ileum, cecal base, or ascending colon. no significant change in goblet cell number. the increase in bile acids probably reflects the increased size of the liver. the results were filtered to remove genes detected below a relative intensity threshold. the second criterion removed around 30% of probes on the microarray. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. expression profiles of a number of genes from cluster 1: upregulated genes in CSF1-Fc-treated pigs. cluster 1 was clearly enriched for genes involved in the cell cycle and innate immunity, whereas cluster 2 was enriched in genes involved in metabolism. there is no evidence among the induced genes of expression of apoptosis-associated genes, no induction of acute phase genes, and no appearance of classical granulocyte marker genes. cytokines TNF, IL1A, and IL1B; interferon targets IDO1; multiple type 1 interferon targets IRF1, IRF5, IFITM2, and IFIT3; TGFB1; and costimulators of T cell activation CD40, CD80, and CD86. cluster 1 also contains numerous cell cycle-associated genes, including PCNA; the key transcription factors FOXM1, E2F4, E2F7, and E2F8; and weaner pigs were treated with a higher dose of 1.0 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for two daily injections, immediately prior to weaning and on the day of weaning followed by euthanasia 24 h. the number of CD163+ cells was more than tripled in the bone marrow, from 10% to over 30%. pigs (4-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 1 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 2 days prior to euthanasia on day 3. blood was collected into EDTA tubes postmortem and complete blood count assessment was performed. pigs (4-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 2 days prior to euthanasia 5 days after the final injection. n = 12 pigs per treatment. we have not compared CSF1-Fc directly with an irrelevant fusion protein. an equivalent dose of IgG1 (10\u201320 mg depending on the size of the pig) would have no impact on plasma IgG concentration (15\u201330 mg/ml) the most obvious effect was hepatosplenomegaly. pig blood monocytes can also be separated into subsets based on expression of surface markers. expression of various markers by peripheral blood monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry staining. the ability of CSF1-Fc to promote monocytosis was associated with expansion of progenitor pools in the marrow. in mice, these cells express sialoadhesin (CD169, which provides a receptor for immature erythrocytes) and are critical for successful engraftment in bone marrow transplantation (10). BM cells were analyzed via flow cytometry for expression of CD14 (A), CD163 (B), CD169 (C), or cKit (D) with exclusion of dead cells using SYTOX blue. n = 4\u20135 pigs per treatment. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days before euthanasia. pigs were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. treatment with CSF1-Fc in pigs produced a small but significant increase in the mean villus length of the mid jejunum but had no detectable effect in the ileum, cecal base, or ascending colon. n = 4\u20135 pigs per treatment. a small increase in bile acids and bilirubin in serum from CSF1-Fc-treated pigs only marginally outside the normal range (50) the increase in bile acids probably reflects the increased size of the liver. the results were filtered to remove genes detected below an arbitrary relative intensity threshold. plasma was produced from whole blood collected in an ACD blood collection bag. pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days prior to euthanasia on day 4. cluster 1, set of genes elevated in all CSF1-Fc-treated pigs, was clearly enriched for genes involved in the cell cycle and innate immunity. cluster 2, set that was reduced in the CSF1-Fc-treated pigs, was enriched in genes involved in metabolism. cluster 1 includes many genes that were shown previously to be restricted to macrophages. cluster 1 contains inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1A, and IL1B; interferon targets IDO1; multiple type 1 interferon targets IRF1, IRF5, IFITM2, and IFIT3; TGFB1; and costimulators of T cell activation CD40, CD80, and CD86. cluster 2 reflects functional zonation of the liver between periportal and perivenous regions of liver lobules (8, 34, 36) unexpected members of this cluster are genes for the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and the target, IGF1, and both estrogen (ESR1) and androgen (AR) receptors. also unexpected is the inclusion of the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, MET, which is implicated in regeneration. this might reflect autoregulation in response to its ligand (52). 163+ macrophages were confirmed by immunostaining in liver and spleen. at this time, there was not a significant monocytosis. both marrow expansion and tissue macrophage proliferation precede monocyte expansion. pigs were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 2 days prior to euthanasia 5 days after the final injection. the increased number of CD163+ macrophages in the liver remained evident after 5 days. native, non-Fc conjugate form of CSF1 has shorter half-life. at same dose had no effect on monocyte-macrophage numbers. equivalent dose of IgG1 (10\u201320 mg depending on the size of the pig) would have no impact on plasma IgG concentration. CSF1-Fc accelerates maturation of macrophage populations in mice and humans. pig blood monocytes can also be separated into subsets based on expression of surface markers. expression of various markers by peripheral blood monocytes was assessed. blood was collected as described in materials and methods. PBMCs were analyzed via flow cytometry for expression of CD16 (A), CD172a (B), CD3 gated on the lymphocyte population exclusively (C), or CD163/CD14 (D) with exclusion of dead cells using SYTOX blue. BM cells were analyzed via flow cytometry for expression of CD16 (A), CD172a (B), CSF1 (C), or CSF1R (D) with exclusion of dead cells using SYTOX blue. the levels of labeling were very low (Fig. 4, C and D). Graphs show the mean percentage positive cells SE, or the median fluorescent intensity. n = 4\u20135 pigs per treatment. origin of the increase in liver and spleen weight. pigs are relatively young, and still growing, and therefore there is significant ongoing proliferation evident from Ki67 staining. the vast majority of Ki67+ nuclei in both control and CSF-1-Fc-treated pig livers were large and round, consistent with identity as hepatocytes. individual Ki67+ and Ki67 nuclei in representative fields from each animal were counted as shown at bottom. changes in the liver might occur secondary to alterations in the gut. CSF1 has been attributed indirect functions in control of proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal epithelium (26, 45) the only change was a small increase in bile acids and bilirubin in serum from CSF1-Fc-treated pigs. the increase in bile acids probably reflects the increased size of the liver. Pigs (8-wk-old males and females) were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 3 days before euthanasia on day 4. plasma was produced from whole blood collected in an ACD blood collection bag. the gene lists of specific clusters are provided in Supplemental Table S1. cluster 1, the set of genes elevated in all CSF1-Fc-treated pigs, was clearly enriched for genes involved in the cell cycle and innate immunity. there is no evidence among the induced genes of expression of apoptosis-associated genes. enriched in the liver mRNA of treated pigs, alongside three of its known ligands, CCL8, CCL14, and CCL3L1. cluster 1 contained numerous known LPS-inducible genes (29) such as inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1A, and IL1B. cluster 1 also contains numerous cell cycle-associated genes. unexpected members of this cluster are genes for the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and the target, IGF1, and both estrogen (ESR1) and androgen (AR) receptors. also unexpected is the inclusion of the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, MET, which is implicated in regeneration (36), but this might reflect autoregulation in response to its ligand (52). the number of CD163+ cells was more than tripled in the bone marrow. at this time, there was not a significant monocytosis. both marrow expansion and tissue macrophage proliferation precede monocyte expansion and are likely direct effects of CSF1-Fc. pigs were injected with PBS or 0.75 mg/kg CSF1-Fc for 2 days prior to euthanasia 5 days after the final injection. pigs were killed 5 days after the second injection. pigs showed mild postweaning diarrhea. in mice, the same impacts on monocyte-macrophage numbers and maturation can be generated by injection of very much higher doses of native CSF1 (21) or injection of a much larger native form of human CSF1 (24). the increase in circulating half-life is the most obvious explanation for the increased efficacy compared with native CSF1. effects of CSF1-Fc on hepatic growth in mice were dependent on monocyte recruitment. effect of CSF1-Fc treatment supports other evidence of existence of a homeostatic feedback loop. effect of CSF1-Fc treatment demonstrates that elevated CSF1 can provoke expansion of the committed monocyte pool in the marrow. e numbers in the liver elicited by CSF1 produce secondary impacts. pigs are selectively located toward the portal vein in mouse liver lobules. this may also serve to localize macrophage-derived hepatocyte proliferative signals. only two doses, administered intramuscularly, were sufficient to produce a sustained increase in monocyte count, liver size, and liver macrophage numbers. we propose that CSF1-Fc could provide protection against disseminated infections arising from the immature gut of early-weaned animals.
