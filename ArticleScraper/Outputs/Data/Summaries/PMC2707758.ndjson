{"summary": "in the classical culture based method, the principal mode of virus identification uses growth of the virus in permissive cells and observation of the morphological changes brought about by virus replication in the host cell. in practice such morphological identification is of limited value because the morphological effects are cell-line specific, and many viruses in the same genus produce rapid and similar cytopathic changes in many of the cell-lines normally used for virus detection. SSCP is a multi-step procedure involving radiolabeling of restriction fragments prior to electrophoretic separation of individual DNA strands. this procedure works best when the restriction fragments are small enough to provide sufficient single-stranded DNA separation for effective strain identification. the region to be amplified for SSCP analysis has to be carefully chosen in order to represent areas of reasonable diversity. oligonucleotide probes synthesize and then immobilized on solid surface. a target consisting of amplified viral complementary DNA labeled and hybridized to the immobilized probes and the hybridization to the individual probes detected. the presence of a change in the nucleotide sequence in the target is detected by the absence or the reduction of hybridization to the wild type probes around the change. HODS Viruses and Plasmids Hepatitis A virus strains HM175/clone 1 and 18f, and coxsackievirus (CV) serotypes B1, A3 and A5 strains used in this study were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) the plasmid pHAV/7 contains a full length cDNA copy of wild type HAV strain HM175 cloned into the vector pGE oligonucleotide sequences were constructed as follows: i) a consensus sequence based on the seven genotype Ib strains that clustered into group 1. iii) a sequence derived from the single HAV genotype II sequence (IIb) available (AY032861) and assigned as group 3, iv) two consensus sequences based on either cluster group 4 or 5 derived from fourteen genotype Ia sequences. each sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides [15]. similar methods were applied to the development and tiling of oligonucleotides as probes for norovirus and rotavirus sequences on the array. resulting array contained approximately 13,000 viral probes. in vitro transcribed and infected cell RNA templates represent in vitro and in vivo replication, respectively. PCR products (5l) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm authenticity of product formation. the reverse primer for CV is degenerate owing to sequence differences. b HAV sequence alignment is presented as the positive (sense) genomic strand in 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 orientation. primer sequence and nucleotide identity is based on the genomic sequence and nucleotide numbering of HM175 strain 18f (M59808) at nucleotide positions 3399 to 3423.

CV strains are identified by their GenBank accession number. arrows identify group individual strain sequences for probe set development. group sequences are designated by the numbers 1-8 followed by the probe set identifier. PCR products (5l) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm authenticity of product formation. PCR Primers Two primers, 3399 - 3423 (forward) and 7084 - 7105 (reverse) were used to amplify an approximately 3.7 kb region of the HAV genome. Tables 1 and 4 contain sequence alignments at the forward and reverse primer binding sites for selected HAV strains represented on the array. b HAV sequence alignment is presented as the reverse complement (antisense) of the genomic strand in 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 orientation. primer sequence and nucleotide identity is based on the genomic sequence and nucleotide numbering of HM175 strain 18f (M59808) at nucleotide positions 3399 to 3423. a CV strains are identified by their GenBank accession number. the primer sequence and nucleotide identity is based on the genomic sequence and nucleotide identity. b CV sequence alignment is presented as the positive (sense) genomic strand in 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 orientation. the primer sequence and nucleotide identity is based on the genomic sequence and nucleotide numbering of CVB1 (M16560) at nucleotide positions 454 to 473. the primer is degenerate where D equals A, G, or T; N equals A, G, or T; R equals A or G; and Y equals C or T, respectively. t-1 DNA and 6 l used per hybridization reaction per well of a 12 well sample pod. the microarray slide was laid on top (oligonucleotide side down) of the sample pod. the slides were washed sequentially with 2XSSC/0.1%SDS, and 0.1XSSC/0.1%SDS at 42 oC then distilled-deionized water at room temperature. coxsackievirus and hepatitis virus belong to the genera Hepatovirus and Enterovirus, respectively. the coxsackievirus genomes are much less conserved and mutations are distributed throughout the genome. genomes of different strains of HAV have been further subdivided into two subgenotypes. a consensus sequence was developed based on sequences available for individual members of these groups. single sequences were used for the strains B4, B5, A16 and A21. sequence diversity was distributed over the entire length of the genome. first 3000 nucleotides were determined to contain sufficient sequence diversity to identify a strain without ambiguity. probes representing a closely related HAV Ib strain from group 2 (hav2b) hybridize the target about two thirds as efficiently, while probes from the more genetically distant genotype II virus (hav3b) hybridize with the least intensity. other probe groups (hav4cb and 5cb) hybridize less efficiently than genotype Ib. hybridization data was converted to average probe intensities. a given probe set represents all probes derived from their respective sequence group. different HAV strains belonging to the same subgenotype Ib sequence (Fig. 1, group 1) were hybridized to the array. despite the variation in average probe intensities for the individual strains against probe set hav1Cb, the information as presented cannot be used to identify actual target nucleotide differences. differences in signal height could be attributed to differing hybridization efficiencies between two different experiments. a target derived from in vitro synthesized RNA from pHAV/7 (representing in vitro replication of the viral genome) was indistinguishable from plasmid derived target, or the virus following several peaks of hybridization intensities were calculated for each probe in the probe set. the fold-change in intensity between clone 1 and 18f targets was calculated for each probe in the probe set HAV1Cb. the probe number that corresponds to each peak was identified. 10 out of 11 predicted nucleotide changes in the 18f genome identified by this method of analysis. these nucleotide changes represent mutations arising in the 18f virus during its emergence as a cytopathic strain from the HM175 noncytopathic strain. these results demonstrate a strong correlation between results obtained by direct sequencing and array hybridization. nucleotide changes were indentified (grey boxed) based on comparison of the clone 1 and 18f GenBank sequences. nucleotide changes were indentified (grey boxed) based on comparison of the clone 1 and 18f GenBank sequences. nucleotide range numbering is defined by the 29-mer probe and corrected to 18f nucleotide numbering from Lemon et al. [21]. d Probe 120 defines a 26 nucleotide base region of 18f due to the three-base GAT deletion. this probe identified as a potential peak overlapping with the peak at probe 441. results show that even with highly (genetically) diverse viruses, this array design can discriminate between strains of the same (or different) virus species. a 746 bp targets derived from coxsackievirus serotype A3 and A5 strains were hybridized to the array. the probes\u2019 sequence for the species was derived from CVA16 (Fig. 2). the results from Fig. (7) also suggest that in a single experiment it is possible to identify whether a virus belongs to group A or group B. identification of coxsackieviruses at the level of serotype strain may be possible without single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. hybridization data (normalized probe intensities) were converted to average probe intensities [15] and plotted vs each individual probe set following hybridization with either CVB1 (panel plot reveals that the HAV genotype 1b (HM175 wild-type) target hybridized most efficiently to probes from genotype Ib, group 1 consensus sequence (hav1cb) the other probe groups hybridize less efficiently than genotype Ib. probe hybridization values were plotted as normalized probe intensities vs all probe sequences. individual probe sequence identifiers are not listed on the plot. a given probe set represents all probes derived from their respective sequence group. a target derived from in vitro synthesized RNA from pHAV/7 (representing in vitro replication of the viral genome) was indistinguishable from plasmid derived target, or the virus following several rounds of replication in culture except for the peak height (data not shown). a target derived from in vitro synthesized RNA from pHAV/7 (representing in vitro replication of the viral genome) was indistinguishable from plasmid derived target, or the virus the presence of a mutation in the genome causes a destabilization of a number of probes around the mutation. this method of analysis offers the potential to differentiate closely related strains of virus belonging to subgenotype Ib at the level of individual nucleotide differences. however, we found peaks of hybridization intensities with the strongest hybridization intensities for the group 1 (HAV1Cb) consensus sequence. clone 1 and 18f amplified target sequences with HAV1Cb probes set sequence synonymous with the target sequences. one would predict a total of 11 peaks to occur by this method of analysis. tiling arrays can be used to detect nucleotide changes over a longer span of the genome. lified targets (3.7 kb) derived from both clone 1 and 18f contain nucleotide sequences synonymous with the first 2.7 kb (probes 1- 543) of the 3.1 kb group 1 (HAV1Cb; Fig. 1) consensus sequence used to develop the HAV1Cb probe set that is comprised of 608 probes. the individual points on the graph represent specific probe numbers. b Probe numbers are from Fig. (6) and represent the oligonucleotide probes whose sequence contains nucleotide change(s) between clone 1 and 18f when the clone 1 target sequence is identical to the probe sequence. nucleotide range numbering is defined by the 29-mer probe and corrected to 18f nucleotide numbering from Lemon et al. [21] hybridization to probes representing all other (non-CV) viruses was essentially at background signal intensity. results are consistent with the extensive sequence heterogeneity that exists between the CV serotype A and B virus strains, the members within a serotype (A or B) as well as the probe sets derived from these strains. results suggest that in a single experiment it is possible to identify whether a virus belongs to group A or group B. RT-PCR is the most widely used molecular method for the detection and identification of viruses in biological and environmental sources. multiplex PCR allows the detection of more than one species of virus in a single analyte. the requirement of size differences in the amplicons to be analyzed by gel electrophoresis also limits its utility. different strains of HAV and many enteric viruses show variable sequence diversity. a single hybridization experiment using a multi-well array can identify a virus without sequencing. a sequence based identification of the same 3.7 kb amplicon would require several sequencing reactions with multiple primers. a sequence based identification of the same 3.7 kb amplicon would require several sequencing reactions with multiple primers. diversity between and among probe sets representing virus strains within a group such as CV increases the power of discrimination. diversity between and among probe sets representing virus strains within a group such as CV increases the power of discrimination. diversity between and among probe sets representing virus strains within a group such as CV increases the power of discrimination. s produces distinctive signal patterns for each genotype/serotype. the need for large scale sequencing is eliminated."}
