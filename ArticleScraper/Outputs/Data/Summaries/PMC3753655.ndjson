{"summary": "RNAs can regulate cellular processes in eukaryotes, some of which are associated with cancers (5\u20137) and neurodegenerative pathologies (8,9). RNAs are thus promising therapeutic targets [reviewed in (10)]. our group previously devised a generic approach to produce a much larger variety of recombinant RNAs in E. coli using a strategy relying on tRNA\u2013RNA fusions. a \u2018tRNA scaffold\u2019 recognized by E. coli cellular factors was built from a tRNA acceptor stem, TC- and D-arms. we present the production of a large RNA of 347 nucleotides (nt) that was sensitive to nucleases when overproduced alone in E. coli. we show that we can produce an Hfq-bound transcript not embedded in the tRNA scaffold, taking advantage of the protection brought by the RNA chaperone against nucleolysis. the armored tRNA scaffold plasmid (pBSTNAV-AtRNA) uses the human tRNALys3 for the tRNA scaffold as previously described (12) the resulting RNA was named AtRNA (Figure 2). This vector was used to insert the various DNA oligonucleotides coding for the RNA fragments between the AatI and XbaI restriction sites. the gene encoding Thermus thermophilus TrmI (29) was inserted in the p44K plasmid between the NdeI and KpNI restriction sites. the gene encoding human tRNALys3 (26) was inserted in the p44K plasmid between the NdeI and KpNI restriction sites. the protein expression was induced in the exponential phase (absorbance at 660 nm between 0.6 and 1) or in the first few hours of the stationary phase, by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-l-thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. the analysis was performed from RNA \u2018minipreps\u2019 on 5-ml cultures grown in Luria Broth (LB) medium. tRNALys3 was purified on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare, 50 ml) equilibrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. the eluate was then extensively dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 50 mM KCl. coat protein were lysed by sonication in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride) the supernatant was loaded onto a column of Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with buffer B. the column was washed with buffer B supplemented with 20 mM imidazole-HCl until a stable baseline is reached. the fractions were analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE stained with S /MS2 coat protein assembly was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. the samples were examined in a JEOL JEM-100 S at 100 kV and at a screened magnification of 100 000. ds for RNA production were derived from the pBSTNAV one by assembling synthetic overlapping oligonucleotides. we amplified the lacI gene and the cloning region of the pACYCDuet-1 by PCR and inserted the PCR product in the Xho1 site of the pBSTNAV plasmid. the gene encoding E. coli tmRNA (GenBank: AP009048.1) or the Aquifex aeolicus tmRNA coding gene (GenBank: AE000657.1) with the MS2 operator (AtmRNA) was subcloned in the pBSTNAV plasmid between the ecoRI and PstI restriction sites. the gene encoding human tRNALys3 (26) was inserted in the p44K plasmid between the NdeI and KpNI restriction sites. the gene encoding E. coli Hfq (GenBank: ACE63256.1) was inserted between the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. the cloned fragments of all constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. tRNALys3 methylation Modified species of tRNALys3 were purified as previously described (26). total RNAs were recovered from cells by phenol extraction and loaded on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare, 50 ml) previously equilibrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) RNA\u2013Protein purification Size exclusion chromatography After induction, bacteria co-expressing the AtRNA/MS2 coat protein were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by ultrasonic disruption in buffer A. the supernatant was then loaded onto a superose 6 prep grade (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. bacteria co-expressing the AtRNA/MS2 coat protein were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by ultrasonic disruption in buffer A. the supernatant was then loaded onto a superose 6 prep grade (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. described was loaded onto an anion exchange column (50 ml, Source 15Q, GE Healthcare) the complex was eluted with a gradient of NaCl between 300 mM and 700 mM in a Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) the protein\u2013RNA samples were prepared in a 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) crystals were obtained in 1.26 M sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate. 0.14 M potassium phosphate dibasic (pH 5.6) were harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. tRNA\u2013RNA fusion (19) was cloned into a high-copy vector. pET vectors (Novagen) are often used to express recombinant proteins in E. coli. the origins of replications determine compatibility of plasmids, i.e. their ability to replicate in conjunction with each other within the same bacterial cell. expression of both RNA and protein in E. coli was unsuccessful. the protein alone was recovered after 3 h of induction followed by cell lysis. after one night of induction only the overexpressed RNA was detected. the pBSTNAV and pACYCT2 plasmids are used to co-express RNA\u2013protein pairs using the two-plasmid strategy. co-expression of RNA\u2013protein partners was tested for the A. aeolicus AtmRNA/MS2 coat protein, AtRNA/MS2 coat protein, E. coli tmRNA/SmpB and phi29 pRNA/gp10. pBSTNAV contains the gene encoding for ampicillin resistance. overexpression of the recombinant RNA is under the control of the constitutive lpp promoter, whereas that of the protein is under the control of the inducible tac promoter. we produced the human tRNALys3 in E. coli using the pBSTNAV. this recombinant tRNA was active as a primer of the HIV-1 reverse transcription (26) some post-transcriptional modifications, such as the m1A58, are lacking because of the heterologous expression in E. coli. the genomic RNA packaged in the E. coli bacteriophage MS2 is resistant to RNase digestion. the MS2 coat protein makes up the bulk of the bacteriophage and assembles into an icosahedral structure of about 26 nm in diameter. the \u2018apo\u2019 form of this 34 nt-long aptamer segment adopts an irregular stem-loop structure that changes conformation upon dye binding. the presence of the MS2 operator hairpin does not impair the overall folding of the recombinant RNA. we then assessed co-production of AtRNA-mala with the MS2 coat protein. the MS2 coat protein and AtRNA still co-eluate at a high molecular weight, even after extensive benzonase treatment. co-expression with the MS2 coat protein renders AtRNA completely resistant to RNases under conditions that rapidly degrade naked RNAs. chromatogram of reference proteins (thyroglobulin: 669 kDa, ferritin: 400 kDa, carbonic anhydrase: 29 kDa) indicated in grey. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of fraction denoted by green arrow. tRNA domain partially mimicking a tRNA and the mRNA-like region (MLR) the tag peptide encodes the tag peptide surrounded by four pseudo-knots. the molecule undergoes systematic degradation by nucleases during its expression in E. coli. we cloned the resulting A. aeolicus AtmRNA into pBSTNAV. we transformed the coli JM101 strains by the pBSTNAV-AtmRNA and the pACYCT2-MS2 coat plasmids. the production of the MS2 coat protein was induced in the exponential phase of the culture for 3 h. the polyhistidine tag prevents the MS2 coat protein from assembling into pseudo-particles. however, the overproduction of the His6-MS2 coat protein prevents the A. aeolicus AtmRNA from nucleolysis in E. coli. RNA extracts in absence () or in presence (+) of benzonase in the lysis supernatant (sonication) were analysed by electrophoresis on a 16% SDS\u2013PAGE gel and visualized by UV shadowing. the black triangle indicates the AtRNA. atmRNA, the A. aeolicus AtmRNA and AtRNA-mala were successfully co-purified with the His6-MS2 coat protein using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. this step was possible because of the tight interaction between the RNA and MS2 protein. the wild-type coat protein forms pseudo-particles in solution, whereas the tagged protein exists as a dimer. cell surface modulation (53), amino acid starvation (54,55), sugar import (56,57), quorum sensing behavior (58,59), switch to anaerobic growth (60,61) and virulence factor expression (62) we focused on SgrS, which is a 227-nt RNA expressed in E. coli during glucose\u2013phosphate stress. crude extract of RNA in absence or presence of Hfq expression was analysed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS\u2013PAGE gel. protein and RNA were visualized by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or UV shadowing. the black and grey triangles indicate SgrS band and Hfq respectively. optimum yields were obtained in recA and endA E.coli strains. however, as these strains do not produce the T7 RNA polymerase, they are not compatible with pET vectors (Novagen) the origins of replications determine the compatibility of plasmids. pBSTNAV and pACYCDuet-1 are compatible. the protein alone was recovered after 3 h of induction followed by cell lysis. after one night of induction only the overexpressed RNA was detected. pACYCT2, pBSTNAV, p44K and pProRNA plasmids are used to co-express RNA\u2013protein pairs using the two-plasmid strategy. co-expression of RNA\u2013protein partners was tested for the A. aeolicus AtmRNA/MS2 coat protein, AtRNA/MS2 coat protein and phi29 pRNA/gp10 in 5 ml of culture. pProRNA was built from the fusion of pACYCT2 and pBSTNAV. it contains the gene encoding for ampicillin resistance. overexpression of the recombinant RNA is under the control of the constitutive lpp promoter, while that of the protein is under the control of the inducible tac promoter. we produced the human tRNALys3 in E. coli using the pBSTNAV. we demonstrated that this recombinant tRNA was active as a primer of the HIV-1 reverse transcription (26), but some post-transcriptional modifications, such as the m1A58, are lacking because of heterologous expression in E. coli. tRNA\u2013RNA fusion can be produced in MS2 coat protein pseudo-particles. this technology comes from the observation that the genomic RNA packaged in the E. coli bacteriophage MS2 is resistant to RNase digestion. encoding the malachite green RNA aptamer (AtRNA-mala) within the cloning site. it specifically binds triphenyl methane-based dyes, including malachite green (47) the \u2018apo\u2019 form adopts an irregular stem-loop structure that changes conformation upon dye binding. the presence of the MS2 operator hairpin does not impair the overall folding of the recombinant RNA. the atRNA and the coat protein co-elute at a molecular weight >669 kDa. this high molecular weight corresponds to the formation of a supramolecular organization consistent with the formation of pseudo-particles. co-expression with the MS2 coat protein renders AtRNA completely resistant to RNases. pACYCT2 plasmids indicate fractions where the MS2 coat protein was found. arrows indicate the fractions where the tmRNA was found. tmRNA is a unique molecule with dual tRNA and mRNA functions. eolicus tmRNA is a multidomain RNA of 347 nt. it comprises two functional domains, the tRNA domain partially mimicking a tRNA and the mRNA-like region (MLR), which encodes the tag peptide. this molecule is therefore a case study for our \u2018tRNA scaffold\u2019 approach. atmRNA/MS2 coat protein pair was cloned into pBSTNAV and pACYT2 plasmids. we cloned the resulting A. aeolicus AtmRNA into pBSTNAV. the production of the MS2 coat protein was induced in the exponential phase of the culture for 3 h. histidine tag was introduced into the loop region of the MS2 coat protein. it was co-expressed with either AtRNA, AtRNA-mala or AtmRNA. the polyhistidine tag prevents the MS2 coat protein from assembling into pseudo-particles. benzonase resistance of the AtRNA because of co-expression with the MS2 protein (wild-type or His-tagged) RNA extracts in absence () or in presence (+) of benzonase in the lysis supernatant (sonication) were analysed by electrophoresis on a 16% SDS\u2013PAGE gel and visualized by UV shadowing. atmRNA, the A. aeolicus AtmRNA and AtRNA-mala were successfully co-purified with the His6-MS2 coat protein using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. this step was possible because of the tight interaction between the RNA and MS2 protein. the wild-type protein forms pseudo-particles in solution, whereas the tagged protein exists as a dimer. we focussed on SgrS, which is a 227-nt RNA expressed in E. coli. the polyU tail of the rho-independent terminator of bacterial small RNAs is essential for Hfq action (64,65) crude extracts of RNA in absence or presence of Hfq expression were analysed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS\u2013PAGE gel. protein and RNA were visualized by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or UV shadowing. the black and grey triangles indicate SgrS band and Hfq, respectively. pACYCT2 plasmid can be modified to co-express multiple proteins. the first application deals with the production of RNA in large quantities in vivo. the first application deals with the production of RNA in large quantities in large quantities in vivo. we demonstrated that co-production of SgrS greatly reduced nucleolysis of the SgrS RNA that occurs in E. coli when this RNA is overproduced alone. our strategy is amenable to simple 96-well format parallelization and remove the need for phenol-extraction steps. the malachite green aptamer is fused to a tRNA scaffold with the MS2 operator hairpin instead of the anticodon loop. this chimeric RNA has been successfully purified via the high affinity interaction between the His-tagged MS2 coat protein and the MS2 operator hairpin. a further development of this method could be the addition of ribozymes in the tRNA scaffold as previously designed (28). chimeric RNA constructs can be packaged into a phage particle. the only requirement for packaging by RNA phages of the MS2 family was the inclusion of an additional hairpin in the tRNA scaffold. our strategy is amenable to simple 96-well format parallelization and remove the need for phenol-extraction steps. RNA\u2013protein co-expression in E. coli in the tRNA scaffold is an efficient way to obtain pure and homogeneous RNA\u2013protein complexes. this strategy has potential application when studying RNA aptamers that target proteins. chimeric RNA is fused to a tRNA scaffold with the MS2 operator hairpin. our system could also allow in vivo monitoring of co-localization of RNA\u2013protein complex. the possibility of FRET between a fluorescent RNA and a protein fused with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) for example."}
