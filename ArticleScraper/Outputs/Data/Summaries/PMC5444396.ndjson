{"summary": "blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg; pulse rate was regular 150 beats per minute; respiratory frequency was 36 breaths per minute; axillary temperature was 35.8\u00b0C; capillary glucose was 138 mg/dL; room air oximetry was 78%. pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right hemi thorax and presence of bilateral rales, rhonchi, and wheezing. 3\u20135 g/dL Eosinophils 0 1\u20134% Lactate 101.5 4.5\u201319.8 mg/dL Lymphocytes 20 18\u201340% pH 7.23 7.35\u20137.45 Monocytes 2 2\u20139% pO2 55 70\u2013100 mmHg Platelets 86 150\u2013400 103/mm3 pCO2 33 35\u201345 mmHg. blood cultures and culture of the tracheal aspirate yielded the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa multi-sensitive. samples were collected from the metalworking fluid used by the patient, which isolated P. aeruginosa. both strains showed PFGE band patterns that were indistinguishable from each other. microscopic examination detected mild chronic glossitis with superficial bacterial plaque with predominantly Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli. the right lung weighed 1525 g (mean reference value [mRV]: 450 g) and left lung, 1235 g (mRV: 375 g) pulmonary parenchymal congestion predominated throughout the lungs. immunohistochemical staining was negative in the oral mucosa (tongue sample) anthracosis was present in the lungs and lymph nodes. the heart was enlarged mainly due to left ventricular hypertrophy. autopsy findings consistent with diagnosis of hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia caused by Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. signs of undiagnosed chronic systemic hypertension were evident in the heart, kidneys, and brain. in 559 hospitalized patients with CAP due to Gram-negative bacteria, arancibia et al.,11 observed body temperatures tended to be lower, patients were less likely to refer chills, and preceding symptoms of upper airways infections were less frequent. dyspnea, respiratory and renal failures, and shock appeared more significantly on admission. tobacco abuse favors and selects the acquisition of Gram-negative bacteria, with emphasis on P. aeruginosa, in the oral cavity in a higher concentration than in non-smokers. the overgrowth of such bacteria in the mouth may also contribute to development of pneumonia. aeruginosa was isolated from metalworking fluid (cutting fluid) in 17% of 150 examined samples in france,35 and 48% (of 72 examined samples) in Zagreb. environmental levels of DEE could decrease clearance of P. aeruginosa and increase lung pathogenicity. case relates more to the patient\u2019s occupation. a similar case was reported in the literature,33 reinforcing our theses on the occupational relationship of our case."}
