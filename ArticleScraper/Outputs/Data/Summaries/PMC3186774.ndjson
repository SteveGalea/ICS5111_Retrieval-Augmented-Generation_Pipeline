{"summary": "127 pathogens were scored according to ten three-tiered criteria. 127 pathogens were ranked in the highest priority group. the amount of attention, efforts and funds spent on surveillance, control and research of infectious agents varies greatly between pathogens, settings and over time. this distribution often appears to be ambiguous, potentially guided by senior leaders' research interests, short-term political agenda or residuals of historic situations. the rational and transparent setting of priorities for investment into health research is therefore becoming an essential part of research planning. the methodology was based on the core domain for good practices in setting priorities for research in health, such as legitimacy and fairness. the core team (YB, AG, GK) contacted relevant leading national public health institutions with the request to name a representative to take part in the Delphi consensus process. a list of pathogens was compiled according to the following selection criteria. the list of pathogens was reviewed by the RKI experts and the Delphi process participants. external experts were asked to assign a weight to each criterion. the final criterion's weight was defined by the median value of all weights assigned by the participating experts. the sum of these weighted scores reflects the total weighted score of a pathogen. the total weighted scores were finally re-scaled to a range from 0 to 100. ten internal experts represented units and departments of the RKI working in the field of infectious diseases. the participants shared expertise in bacteriology, virology, mycology, parasitology, general infectious diseases, tropical medicine, epidemiology, public health, veterinary health and infection control. the list of pathogens was compiled according to the following selection criteria. external experts asked to assign a value ranging from 0 to 10 to each criterion. the value 0 reflects the lowest and 10 the highest level of importance of a criterion. more than one criterion could be assigned the same weight, similar to techniques used in other prioritization exercises. each infectious pathogen has an ability to emerge or re-emerge. the final criteria and their definitions are presented in the Table S1. events require public health actions (25\u201375%) 7 Trend** Diminishing incidence rates Increasing incidence rates 8 Public attention (including political agenda and public perception) Risk perception of this pathogen by general public is moderate and informal political expectations/agenda is present This pathogen implies international duties or its risk perception by general public is high. criteria were weighted by 86 experts (14 RKI and 72 external experts) all participants took part in the weighting. the opinions regarding importance of individual criteria varied greatly across the participants. 7.5 Chronicity of illness or sequelae 8.0 7.0 8.0 8.5 Incidence 7.0 8.0 8.0 Health care utilization 6.0 6.0 6.0 8.0 Work and school absenteeism 6.0 5.0 7.0 8.0 Trend 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 Public attention 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 We analyzed weights assigned by experts working in different areas of medicine.

Criteria weighting All criteria were weighted by 86 experts (14 RKI and 72 external experts) the opinions regarding importance of individual criteria varied greatly across the participants. 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 We analyzed weights assigned by experts working in different areas of medicine. the criterion \u201cIncidence\u201d was seen as one of the most important by epidemiologists and public health experts (median weight of \u201c8\u201d) and laboratory specialists (n = 35) and clinicians (n = 8). and Hantavirus now belong to this group, while in 2004 both pathogens held medium priority positions. other pathogens that were scored highest in 2004 were now assessed to be in the medium priority group (e.g., Parvovirus B19). psittaci Helminths (nematodes)*** Hepatitis B virus Dengue fever virus Citrobacter spp. Lassa fever virus Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 Staphylococcus aureus incl. methicillin resistant (MRSA) and Staphylococcus aureus, toxigenic Listeria monocytogenes Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 Staphylococcus epidermidis/Coagulase-negative staphylococci Microspora and trichophyton HHV-8 (Kaposi's s ersinia enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis Trichinella spiralis Trichomonias vaginalis Trypanosoma brucei gambiensi and brucei rhodesiensi Vaccinia virus Vibrio cholera Vibrios (non-cholera) group includes: Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis felineus, Opisthorhis viverrini, the high priority group contains 39 (30.7%) and the medium priority group - 45 (35.4%) pathogens. the results of our work seem convincing to us; they support our current activities as well as indicate new directions for the future work. VZV among the pathogens in the highest priority group helped us identify the under-recognized importance of the diseases with respect to surveillance and epidemiological research. the low priority group contains both pathogens with very low incidence in Germany (e.g., mycobacterium leprae or helminths) and those much more common (e.g., Roseolovirus or Chlamydia pneumoniae) complex surveillance systems exist for some pathogens assigned to the medium priority group. however, the need to investigate outbreaks associated with these pathogens remains. we found the compilation of the data necessary for the scoring process to be challenging. our pathogen-specific approach allowed us to conduct prioritization not influenced by programmatic views. this approach helped us uncover some differences in the importance of pathogens belonging to the same group, e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonias vaginalis. the prioritization methodology presented here is based on the systematic evaluation of evidence and the involvement of a broad range of external experts. our comprehensive and transparent approach makes the results defensible and shall give guidance for current needs in surveillance and epidemiological research in Germany."}
