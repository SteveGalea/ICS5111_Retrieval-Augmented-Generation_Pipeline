{"summary": "the same HCV-immune antibody library was panned repeatedly against the E1E2 complex and E1E2 masked by antibodies isolated in the previous rounds of panning. a total of 73 antibodies (fragment antigen-binding, Fab) to E1E2 were isolated from the antibody repertoire. new antibodies are segregated into two clusters. Fab fragments N4, O1, P2, and S1 bind to a cluster of overlapping epitopes. Fab fragments R1 and V1 bind to a cluster of overlapping epitopes. mAbs AR4A and AR5A pulled down the wild-type E1E2 complex but not the mutant xN196/305A. the control anti-E1 or anti-E2 mAb pulled down both E1 and E2 of the xN196/305A mutant, indicating that some of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins were still complexed. the effect of mAbs AR4A and AR5A on the binding of E1E2 to the large extracellular loop of CD81 (CD81-LEL) was studied by ELISA. the epitope recognized by mAb AR3A, but not the other three mAbs, overlap with E1E2 CD81bs. anti-HIV mAb b6 (11), and protein A-conjugated agarose were analyzed by reducing SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting using mAb A4 for E1 (47) and mAb HCV1 for E2 (8). the 2,160 E2 sequences deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (http://www.viprbrc.org), respectively. the residue is located within the membrane proximal external region (MPER), 20 residues upstream of the transmembrane domain. further studies are needed to define their roles in E1E2 complex formation. house neutralization assays to HCVpp having good infectivity. mAb AR4A cross-neutralized all isolates evaluated in the assays. mAbs AR3A, AR4A, and AR5A neutralized 38%, 63%, and 17% of the virus panel. the panel of mAbs includes HCV Envs that produce a signal at least 10-fold higher than the background signal caused by control pseudotype virus particles without HCV Env. none of the mAbs neutralized pseudotype virus particles displaying the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSVpp) mice were injected i.p. with 100 mg/kg of mAb AR3A, AR4A. the animals were challenged with 2 107 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of chimeric HCVcc carrying the structural proteins of the genotype 1b Con1 isolate. the results showed that the mAbs inhibited genotypes 1b and 2a virus infection, with mAb AR4A alone having the best antiviral activity. notably, the presence of one mAb to the virus did not enhance the antiviral activity of the other mAb in this experimental model. multiple AR3-specific mAbs were found to cross-neutralize isolates of diverse HCV genotypes. both AR4 and AR5 overlap significantly with an epitope recognized by mAb CBH-7. the binding of AR4- and AR5-specific antibodies requires proper folding of the complex. mutations that abolish AR4 and AR5 simultaneously are clustered into three regions, the E1 region 201\u2013206 and the E2 regions 657\u2013659 and 692. the folded E1 and E2 heterodimer will likely be orientated in a manner that the N terminus of E1 is associated with the C terminus of the E2 ectodomain. s in both the HCVpp and HCVcc virus systems, these relatively conserved epitopes are likely exposed on free virus particles. these epitopes may be important for virus entry and that bound antibodies may interfere with virus interactions with other coreceptors. the panel of mAbs and E1E2 mutants should provide new opportunities to study the HCV E1E2 glycoprotein complex. it has been difficult to study HCV E1E2 complex because folded E1 and E1E2 cannot be produced as soluble proteins for biochemical analysis. the panel of antibodies was generated from an HCV-immune antibody library by phage-display technology. antibody Fab fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli by using the pComb3H vector and purified with protein G-conjugated agarose. soluble E2 antigens were harvested as cell supernatant. antibody neutralization of HCV was determined by using the HCVcc (26\u201328, 32) and HCVpp (23, 24) virus systems. luciferase activity was determined by the reduction of luciferase activity in Huh-7 cells infected with HCVpp displaying Env from different isolates. antibody synergism was calculated based on the median-effect equation using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) antibody Fab fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli by using the pComb3H vector and purified with Protein G-conjugated agarose. soluble E2 antigens were harvested as cell supernatant. antibody neutralization was determined by using the HCVcc (26\u201328, 32) and HCVpp (23, 24) virus systems. of 293T cells with the pNL4-3.lucRE and the corresponding expression plasmids encoding the E1E2 genes by polyethylenimine, and virus infection of Huh-7 cells was detected by using the firefly luciferase assay system (11). Neutralization of HCVpp was determined by the reduction of luciferase activity in Huh-7 cells infected with HCVpp displaying Env. can be found in SI Materials and Methods."}
