{"summary": "fever screening based on non-contact infrared (IR) thermometers (NCITs) and IR thermographs (IRTs) represents the only currently viable approaches. a standard indicates that IRT measurements should be performed with an accurate blackbody in the image as a reference and that preferred tissue sites for imaging provide the most accurate estimates of core body temperature. affine transformation can be improved through free form deformation (FFD) transformation. affine transformation can be improved through free form deformation (FFD) transformation. the SSD similarity metric is the simplest similarity metric for image registration. it assumes a linear intensity relationship between images I r e f and I r e g. it assumes a linear intensity relationship between images I r e f and I r e g. a joint histogram is defined as a two-dimensional plot showing combinations of intensity levels. the value at location (i, j) in a joint histogram represents the number of pixels whose intensity level is i in one image and j in the other. a joint histogram shows decreased dispersion as registration accuracy increases. transformation models can be classified as linear transformations (e.g., rigid, affine, projective) and non-linear transformations (e.g., curved (or elastic), FFD) [20,21] and may include translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, shear, and projection. both the parametric and non-parametric transformations have many parameters. the displacement field at every pixel (x, y), T(x, y) is defined as a function of displacement vectors (u, v) in the neighborhood of coarse grid control points. a registration algorithm can be decomposed into three components: a similarity metric [11], a transformation model [12,13,14], and an optimization method [14,15,16]. a landmark-based metric can be used to find transformation using unique landmarks in the reference and moving images. an intensity-based metric works directly with pixel intensity levels. metric is a more general similarity metric for image registration. it assumes a linear intensity relationship between images I r e f and I r e g. regions with different intensity levels in an image would correspond to similar regions in another image that also contain similar intensity levels. entropy of a joint histogram decreases as the alignment of images increases. entropy of a joint histogram decreases as the alignment of images increases. the problem of registration is converted into an optimization problem. linear transformations are global (i.e., warping the whole image) [20,21] and may include translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, shear, and projection. simple planar surfaces can be modeled through translation, rotation, scaling, and shear. an optimization method tries to minimize (or maximize) the specified similarity metric over the search space of possible parameters for the transformation model. an optimization method must be reliable and quick to find the best possible parameters of the transformation model. the images of volunteers were captured using a visible camera (HD Pro Webcam C920, Logitech International S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) and an IRT (8640 P-series, Infrared Cameras Inc., Beaumont, TX, USA) the image pairs from the visible camera and IRT were used to develop the registration method and quantitatively measure the registration accuracy. fine registration was used to improve registration accuracy of IR-visible image pairs and to enable accurate localization of the canthi regions. the fine registration uses FFD and needs to define a vector field for each pixel. the gradient of the reference image I r e f is computed only once during the iterations. the displacement fields at each stage can be up-sampled to a finer scale. the displacement fields at each stage can be up-sampled to a finer scale. implementation of B-spline uses a uniform mesh of the control points. each set of m m pixels correspond to a single spline patch defined by four control points. resolution of the control points defines degrees of freedom. control point mesh and associated spline-based FFD defined the transformation at each level of resolution. based on the order of basis function, the B-spline can be further classified into linear, quadratic, cubic, or higher-order B-spline registrations. the fine registration uses FFD and needs to define a vector field for each pixel in the image. demons algorithm proposes non-linear registration as a diffusion process, which introduces entities called Demons. a multi-scale approach reduces the magnitude of displacement vectors. for example, reference and moving images can be down-sampled to low-resolution images. the displacement fields at each stage can be up-sampled to a finer scale. implementation of B-spline uses a uniform mesh of the control points. each set of m m pixels correspond to a single spline patch defined by four control points. a large spacing of the control points allows modeling of global non-linear deformations. results We recruited 52 subjects for the study. we evaluated the registration accuracy in two approaches based on circular aluminum foil markers and manually selected landmarks on 10 subjects. visible (green) and IR (b,d) images before (a,b) and after (c,d) coarse registration. corresponding image registration results viewed through superimposed checkerboard pattern of visible and IR images in gray scale. the registration MSE based on markers was 5.0 1.6 pixels on 6 subjects. it improved to 3.6 1.5 pixels with the coarse-Demons method. error in localizing the canthi regions with the coarse-Demons method was converted to 2.8 1.2 mm. the recall graphs plot the recall values against different threshold values. the recall curves were based on average values from the subjects in Table 1. the algorithms using coarse-Demons method outperform the other methods. the canthi regions are not susceptible to other factors (exertion, environment) because the blood in these regions is sufficiently supplied by the internal carotid artery and the heat loss is less than other regions such as the forehead. the canthi regions were mirrored to the IR image based on our coarse-Demons MMIR model. the maximum temperatures (Ta) within the canthi regions were then automatically read from the IR image. the average values of the maximum temperatures were used to compare the manual and automatic approaches. the fine registration can be based on the Demons or the cubic B-spline algorithm. prominent edge features like eyes, nose, and mouth with the coarse-demons and coarse-spline methods have been better aligned compared to the coarse registration alone. images were removed using the Spot Healing Brush Tool in Adobe Photoshop\u00ae. the spatial transformation obtained was applied to the control points for a direct registration without further optimization. registration accuracy was analyzed with both MSE and recall [7,26] values. the recall values on all marker pairs were computed. the true positive correspondence was counted when the pair falls within a given accuracy threshold of the Euclidean distance between points in the registered image and the corresponding points in the reference image. the recall curves were based on average values from the subjects in Table 1. the coarse-spline method improved to 3.2 1.6 pixels after the Demons registration. the coarse-spline method showed slightly better accuracy than the coarse method. the recall curves were based on average values from the subjects in Table 2. 3.5 5.7 Sub.
