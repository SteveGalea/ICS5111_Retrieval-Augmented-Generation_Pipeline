{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus that is phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5. no live virus has ever been isolated for these viruses and they have not been grown in cell culture. the genomes of MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012), BtCoV-HKU4 (Woo et al., 2006) and BtCoV-HKU5 (Woo et al., 2006) are predicted to express a set of four such accessory proteins, encoded by ORF3, -4a, -4b and -5. the ORF4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) of MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012), BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 was able to inhibit IFN-induction but only modestly inhibit the NF-B signalling pathway. each accessory protein was compared with the homologous MERS-CoV accessory protein using clustal w for annotation of amino acid identity and similarity. hek293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and analysed by Western blotting with anti-HA, anti-flag and anti-actin antibodies. hek293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and analysed by Western blotting with anti-HA, anti-flag and anti-actin antibodies. a study of the subgenomic transcripts produced by MERS-CoV suggests that ORF4b is not preceded by its own transcription regulatory sequence. we showed robust expression of ORF4b in MERS-CoV-infected Vero and Huh7 cells by 9 h post-infection (p.i.) transfected cells were double labelled using a lysotracker, Mitotracker or concanavalin A. cells were double labelled for p4b and dsRNA, a marker for viral RNA replication intermediates, and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to label nuclear DNA. vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV, paraformaldehyde fixed at 9 h p.i. and double labelled for p4b and dsRNA. nuclear DNA stained with Hoechst 33258. each protein has a predicted bipartite NLS (called site 1 and site 2). both sites were targeted by replacing each of the basic amino acids with alanine. the effect on protein localization was analysed. mutagenesis of either predicted site 1 or site 2 abolished its nuclear localization. we found that the N-terminal region of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 p4b contains NLSs that may be important for their function. HEK293T cells were transfected with the IFN-/luciferase plasmid alone. either an empty GFP expression plasmid or a plasmid expressing the p4b protein of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 or BtCoV-HKU5. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the IFN-/luciferase reporter, N-RIG (a constitutive RIG-I mutant) and either empty vector or each of the accessory proteins of the three viruses in triplicate. after 18 h, cells were treated with 10 ng TNF- and incubated for an additional 6 h. luciferase induction could be strongly inhibited by expression of p4b from MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 or BtCoV-HKU5. analysis of NF-B promoter inhibition by MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 p4b. we hypothesized that p4b would also inhibit NF-B signalling. the cells were lysed and assayed for their level of firefly luciferase. expression of MERS-CoV and BtCoV-HKU4 p4b resulted in only a twofold inhibition of NF-B signalling, while BtCoV-HKU5 p4b induced a fourfold inhibition. these results were statistically significant but do not demonstrate robust inhibition of this pathway. the p4b proteins of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 can inhibit specific innate immune signalling pathways in cells. there was no correlation between nuclear localization and p4b IFN antagonism. this suggested that the nuclear localization of p4b has other functions outside of innate immune inhibition. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. expression levels were assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP or anti-HA antibody. these data demonstrated robust expression of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 p4b. p4b-specific antiserum showed robust expression of ORF4b in mERS-CoV-infected Vero and Huh7 cells by 9 h post-infection (p.i.) p4b localized strictly to the nucleus with some minor cytoplasmic foci that did not co-localize with any of the specific organelles tested. V-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 were transfected into vero E6 cells. cells were double labelled for p4b and dsRNA, a marker for viral RNA replication intermediates. in these cells, the MERS-CoV p4b localized to the nucleus. p4b proteins analysed were only 50 % similar and 30 % identical in amino acid sequence. this result was confirmed by analysing the localization of the native MERS-CoV ORF4b protein in infected cells. both sites were targeted by replacing each of the basic amino acids with alanine and the effect on protein localization was analysed. mutagenesis of either the predicted site 1 or site 2 abolished its nuclear localization. the N-terminal region of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 p4b contains NLSs that may be important for their function in pathogenesis. p4b cells respond to viral infection by inducing an innate immune response. plasmid encoding an N-terminally truncated RIG-I (N-RIG; a potent inducer of the IFN- promoter) and either an empty GFP expression plasmid or a plasmid expressing the GFP-tagged p4b protein of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 or BtCoV-HKU5. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the IFN-/luciferase reporter, N-RIG (a constitutive RIG-I mutant) and either empty vector or each of the accessory proteins of the three viruses in triplicate. after 18 h, cells were treated with 10 ng TNF- and incubated for an additional 6 h. p4b of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 is a potent IFN antagonist. the NF-B pathway is a critical signalling cascade that regulates innate immune responses. we hypothesized that p4b would also inhibit NF-B signalling to block a potent antiviral response. expression of MERS-CoV and BtCoV-HKU4 p4b resulted in only a twofold inhibition of NF-B signalling, while BtCoV-HKU5 p4b induced a fourfold inhibition. these results do not demonstrate robust inhibition of this pathway, compared with NF-B inhibition seen in previous studies. the p4b proteins of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 can inhibit specific innate immune signalling pathways in cells. p4b mutants that no longer localized to the nucleus were still able to inhibit IFN- gene induction and NF-B signalling. this suggests that the nuclear localization of p4b has other functions outside of innate immune inhibition. the phylogenetically related genome sequences were derived from bat samples in china. however, the viruses themselves have never been isolated. direct comparison of viral infection among the three viruses is not possible. p4b of KU5 is localized to the nucleus when tagged with GFP. as the addition of a large GFP tag may influence the protein\u2019s localization, we also analysed MERS-CoV p4b expression and targeting in infected cells. we then mutagenized either site 1 or site 2 of the predicted NLS in each p4b. we used a constitutively active RIG-I variant, called N-RIG, and IRF3 as inducers. expression of GFP-tagged MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 p4bs significantly inhibited IFN- induction and NF-B signalling. e pox virus expresses IFN antagonists that work in mouse cells but not in rabbit cells. the species tropism can be changed by swapping the antagonists from rabbit pox virus to mouse pox virus. MERS-CoV genomic RNA has been found in humans and bats. increased deep-sequencing capacity and respiratory virus screening will allow scientists to identify previously unidentifiable respiratory infections in patients. this type of continued surveillance and in-depth dissection of novel viral pathogens will reveal commonalities that may aid in identifying drug targets for future therapeutics. further dissection of the p4b NLS and nuclear import machinery is needed to understand the exact composition required for localization of p4b to the nucleus. to test IFN- gene induction, we used a constitutively active RIG-I variant, called N-RIG, and IRF3 as inducers. some viral innate immune inhibitors are host specific. for example, ectromelia virus expresses IFN antagonists that work in mouse cells but not in rabbit cells. by swapping the IFN antagonists from rabbit pox virus to mouse pox virus, the species tropism can be changed. increased surveillance of environmental reservoirs will help identify additional coVs and other potential human pathogens. increased deep-sequencing capacity and respiratory virus screening will allow scientists to identify previously unidentifiable respiratory infections in patients.
