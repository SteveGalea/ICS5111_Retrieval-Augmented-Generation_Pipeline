{"summary": "atelectasis is one of the most common respiratory complications after heart surgery. it is characterized by the collapse of the alveoli, lobules or larger unit respiratory systems that occurs after thoracic surgeries due to factors such as uneven distribution of ventilation and perfusion. the high incidence rate of atelectasis after heart surgery is still reported in patients (7, 15) the use of PEEP is applied along with an increase in respiratory factors, lung volumes and improved gas and alveolar exchanges. it is recommended for the main treatment of collapse created in patients under anesthesia with healthy lungs (18, 19), atelectasis treatment and improved arterial oxygenation (20, 21) study population was composed of all patients who had undergone an open-heart surgery and were hospitalized in either cardiac surgical ward or post-cardiac surgery intensive care unit. sample size was calculated to include at least 55 subjects in each group according to the similar article and the incidence rate of atelectasis(28) patients were randomly assigned into three groups: control (PEEP= 5), PEEP= 8 and PEEP= 10. inclusion criteria included non-emergency open heart surgery. no history of chronic lung disease and any damage to the lungs. the participants were allocated in three groups of PEEP8, PEEP10, and control using Excel's RANDBETWEEN function. each group was identified by a letter (A, B, or C) randomly selected using RANDBETWEEN function of Excel. each opaque and sealed envelope contained a letter (A, B, or C) randomly selected using RANDBETWEEN function. the incidence rate of atelectasis was recorded two hours after extubation and on the third postoperative day (72 hours after surgery) none of the routine care in all three groups was omitted. the primary consequences included intubation time in post-cardiac surgery intensive care unit, length of ICU and hospital stay. n (%) 6(10) 5(8.33) 4(6.77) x2=0.436 p=0.80NS No, n (%) 54(90) 55(91.73) 56(93.33) BMI (kg/m 2 ) 27.295.54 26.384.62 25.835.14 F=1.220 p=0.29NS NS: Not Significant In addition, there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups for variables associated with surgery. n (%) 41(68.33) 41(68.33) 42(70) No, n (%) 8(13.31) 8(13.31) 7(11.66) Anesthesia time (h), (mean SD) 4.550.89 4.610.85 4.530.82 F=0.126 p=0.88NS Aortic clamp time (min), (mean SD) 56.9022.34 57.2822.13 56.6320.3 F=0.014 p= time atelectasis test and P value Groups Yes No Total 2 hours after extubation Control, n (%) 22(36.66) 38(63.33) 60 (100) 6.70= x2 p=0.035 PEEP8, n (%) 20(33.33) 40(66.77) 60(100) PEEP10, n (%) 10(16.66) 50(83.33) 60(100) Total, n (%) 52(28.88 after surgery (n= 21, 35%), with eight cases improvement and 19 new cases, was not significantly different based on McNemar's test compared with a time of two hours after extubation (n= 10, 16.6%) (p0.001). atelectasis incidence rate between two hours after extubation and on the third day after surgery in each group. significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p=0.91). no significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.91). 8 cm H2O PEEP and 5 cm H2O PEEP had no significant effect in reducing the incidence rate of atelectasis. in a similar study on the effect of 5 cm H2O PEEP and 10 cm H2O PEEP after coronary artery bypass surgery, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of atelectasis incidence. however, the level of 10 cm H2O PEEP reduced the incidence rate of atelectasis, which in the present study, patients received 8 or 10 cm H2O PEEP for a maximum of 4 hours continuously, which the time remained constant for all samples. the results of the study showed that the levels of 5 to 8 cm H2O PEEP improved hypoxia and reduced the incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the patients. 18 new cases of atelectasis in group PEEP5, but 20 new cases of atelectasis in group PEEP8 on the third day after surgery were statistically significant. this decline might be due to better levels of arterial oxygenation in the ICU after heart surgery in early times. in the present study, age over 65 years was one of the exclusion criteria. there were significant differences between the incidence rate of atelectasis after extubation on the first day and on the third day, duration of intubation, length of ICU stay and hospitalization in PEEP10 group compared with control and the PEEP8 groups. project and thesis in the field of critical care nursing approved by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. ethics Statement This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT201507307494N14), and obtained the code of ethics committee (IR.MAZUMS.REC.94-1855)."}
