{"summary": "introduction ISG20 was identified in 1997 as a type-I interferon-induced protein associated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and then to nucleoli and Cajal bodies [1\u20133]. the protein belongs to the DnaQ-like (or DEDD, for Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp) 3\u2019-5\u2019 exonuclease superfamily that includes several enzymes with DNA or RNA specificities a number of studies have observed viral inhibition by ISG20 in the absence of viral RNA degradation [10, 11], raising the possibility that alternative mechanisms may be at play. we provide evidence that this mechanism broadly targets mRNA transcripts originated from exogenous genetic material independently of its viral origins. this mechanism of discrimination relies on an intact catalytic core, but takes place in the absence of target mRNA degradation. stably expressing ISG20 were generated by retroviral-mediated gene transduction followed by the selection of the pool of transduced cells. all subsequent experiments were carried out at non-cytotoxic levels of ISG20 expression. this was not due to loss of the RNA exonuclease abilities of ISG20. ISG20 inhibits VSV replication through a translational blockage. the percentage of GFP-positive cells expressing or not ISG20 was determined by flow cytometry. ISG20 imposed a strong translational inhibition to the expression of viral-coded proteins (N and GFP) under these experimental conditions, WT ISG20 was capable of discriminating viral from cellular mRNAs. the antiviral activity of ISG20 strictly correlate with its ability to act as a general translational modulator of non-self genetic material. similar results were obtained with PCR amplicons placed at different location on the gfp mRNA. reverse transcription reactions started with random hexamers or at the polyA tail with oligo-dT primers. the antiviral properties of ISG20 strictly correlate with its ability to act as a general modulator of translation of non self genetic elements. translational effects (input), while the rest was used for immunoprecipitations with anti-flag antibodies specific for tagged ISG20 and TREX1 proteins. samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel for phosphor imager analysis. the ability of these mutants to inhibit translation from ectopically expressed genes was assessed either directly by 35S metabolic labeling, or by WB. the mutants behaved as the catalytically inactive M1-ISG20 and did not significantly affect protein translation, highlighting a near perfect correlation between antiviral abilities and translation inhibition of non-self material. retroviral-mediated gene transduction was used to stably integrate into the host genome the identical CMV-GFP expression cassette used in Fig 2A. after a three weeks selection, cells were transiently transfected with WT ISG20, lysed and analyzed by WB. in this case, ISG20 did not modify the amount of produced GFP. the first cistron bears the 5\u2019UTR of the cellular gene globin (Glo) the second cistron is under the control of several IRESes. mRNA levels have been normalized to controls (no ISG20 condition) luciferase activities are reported after mRNA normalization. HEK293T cells bearing stable EBV-GFP episomes were transfected with DNAs coding for WT ISG20. ISG20 did not affect the amount of GFP expressed from the EBV genome, whereas it did affect the amount of Gag. effect of ISG20 on EBV infection was determined in Hone-1 cells. a series of constructs was used to determine whether ISG20 affected translation initiation by comparing more specifically its effects on cap-dependent versus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-translation. ISG20 was capable of inhibiting both cap- and IRES-dependent translation from bicistronic mRNAs in the absence of mRNA degradation. in the case of direct mRNA transfection the extent of ISG20 inhibition was lower than in the case of DNA transfections. but we believe this is mainly due to the shorter time frame elapsing between transfection and luciferase assay (one hour, as opposed to overnight) ISG20 induction by doxycycline in stable HEK293T and U937 cells did not induce a concomitant IFIT1 production. to this end, ISG20 expression was induced via doxycycline in stable HEK293T and 24 hours later supernatants were harvested and incubated with reporter HEK293T cells bearing an integrated expression cassette responsive to type I interferons. stable-ISG20 cells stimulated for twenty-four hours with different concentrations of doxycycline, or with IFN2 (1.000 U/ml) the supernatant was then transferred to reporter cells expressing Luciferase under the control of the IFN-inducible promoter. the linearity and limit of detection of the assay are routinely determined with external dilutions of IFN. ISG20 inhibition of translation correlates with its association with cytoplasmic P bodies ISG20 is largely distributed throughout the entire cell [3, 10], although some studies reported a more specific association with nuclear bodies. we used a commonly used technique to reveal protein association to nuclear bodies. HEK293T ISG20-expressing cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy along with two markers of P bodies, TNRC6A and DDX6. control cells not expressing ISG20 are shown only as a zoomed overlay, while the complete panel are presented in S12B Fig. murine ISG20 (mISG20) was ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells. it impaired expression from transfected DNA coding for a luciferase reporter. the extent of infection was monitored by WB (panels) or FACS. isg20 knockout mice were generated by CRISPR mediated gene editing. functional ablation of ISG20 was controlled upon in vitro stimulation of Bone-Marrow derived Macrophages. survival rates of isg20-/- mice were severely compromised with respect to age- and sex-matched controls. bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated either with IFN or VSV for eight to twelve hours prior to WB analysis. isg20-/- and +/+ age- and sex-matched littermates were intraperitoneally infected with VSV. gfp behaves as an additional transcriptional viral unit inserted between the M and the G genes. ectopic expression of ISG20 did not lead to indiscriminate degradation of cellular RNAs. twenty-four hours post-induction, cells were challenged with replication-competent VSV-GFP. percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined at different time points post infection by flow cytometry. a fraction of HeLa cells expressing or not ISG20 were lysed and analyzed by RT-qPCR. the antiviral activity of ISG20 strictly correlates with its ability to act as a general translational modulator of non-self genetic material. the findings indicate that under these experimental conditions ISG20 was capable of discriminating viral from cellular mRNAs. cal microscopy 24 hours after VSV-GFP challenge at an MOI of 0.01. the same cells used in the bottom panels in A were also analyzed by WB, RT-qPCR (RNA), qPCR (DNA) as indicated. graph presents typical replication curves obtained from three independent experiments. a series of mutations were engineered in ISG20 outside the Exo domains. not all mutants could be detected upon transfection and WB analysis. these mutations could potentially affect phosphorylation on Serine (M2 and M2-1), or trafficking via mutations in dileucine domains (M4 and M3) or in nuclear localization signals (M5) the mutants behaved as WT and strongly reduced the rate of protein synthesis from the exogenous reporter genes. in contrast, the M3, M4 and M2-1 mutants behaved as the catalytically inactive M1-ISG20 and did not significantly affect protein translation. a near perfect correlation between antiviral abilities and translation inhibition of non-self material. mRNA mimicry of self allows escape from ISG20 translational targeting. HEK293T cells were transfected with a stable episomal EBV genome. mRNA levels have been normalized to controls (no ISG20 condition). luciferase activities are reported after mRNA normalization. the 5\u2019UTRs of these mRNAs varied with respect to the requirement of specific eIFs and were derived from the cellular gene myc (Myc), the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and VSV. SG20 on EBV infection was determined in Hone-1 cells upon the reactivation of the viral lytic cycle with TPA/BA [21]. results indicate that ISG20 discriminates mRNAs based on their self/non-self genesis. ISG20 exerts similar inhibitory effects on both intron and intronless constructs. ISG20 was capable of inhibiting both cap- and IRES-dependent translation from bicistronic mRNAs in the absence of mRNA degradation. capped and polyadenylated mRNAs coding luciferase under the control of several 5\u2019 untranslated regions (5\u2019 UTRs) were generated in vitro and directly transfected in ISG20-expressing cells. IFIT1 does not participate in ISG20-mediated translation inhibition. this work raised the possibility that ISG20 could inhibit translation indirectly via the induction of IFIT1. to address this possibility, we analyzed IFIT1 expression in both ectopically transfected HEK293T and U937 cells. reporter HEK293T cells were harvested and incubated with luciferase. the levels of type-I IFN measured via this assay remained below the threshold of detection (30 U/mL, in our hands), indicating the absence of major IFN up-regulation following ISG20 induction. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids coding for either ISG20 or IFIT1 along with a GFP-coding plasmid followed by WB analysis. to this end, HEK293T cells were transfected with DNA coding these proteins along with GFP as non self genetic material. partial co-localization of ISG20 was observed with splicing speckles (SC35 nuclear bodies, S12A Fig) but the signal was essentially lost upon detergent pre-extraction, suggesting that the association between ISG20 and NBs may be very weak. the graph presents the proportion of cells exhibiting detectable P bodies in the presence or absence of puromycin and/or ISG20. the different ISG20 mutants were similarly analyzed by confocal microscopy with the exception that an HA-tagged, destabilized form of TNRC6A was concomitantly expressed by transfection to increase the extent of P bodies accumulation. murine ISG20 (mISG20) was ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells prior to VSV challenge at an MOI of 0.1. it impaired expression from transfected DNA coding for a luciferase reporter. mISG20 was also able to cluster along with TNRC6A bodies. g20-/- mice were viable and displayed the expected Mendelian frequency. survival rates of isg20-/- mice were severely compromised. peritoneal macrophages isolated from isg20-/- mice showed increased susceptibility to infection. hematoxylin and eosin staining preferentially label inflammatory cells. mice genetically deficient in ISG20 exhibit higher mortality following viral challenge. ISG20 acts as an important antiviral factor in vitro, as well as in vivo. despite the fact that the catalytically inactive mutant loses its exonuclease and translation inhibition activities, whether the former is required for translation inhibition remains unclear. despite the fact that the catalytically inactive mutant M1 loses both its exonuclease and translation inhibition activities, whether the former is required for translation inhibition remains unclear. a previous study suggested that ISG20 could interfere with viral translation in the absence of target RNA degradation. this inhibition was linked to the ability of ISG20 to induce IFN when expressed in MEF cell lines. however, this inhibition was linked to the ability of ISG20 to induce IFN when expressed in the interferon-Protein with Tetratricopeptide repeats 1 protein (IFIT1). RNA degradation has been further complexified by studies indicating their role in RNA storage as well as in RNA translational repression in the absence of RNA degradation. however, it remains possible that these structures form as a consequence of the translational block itself [43\u201345] so that additional work will be required to firmly establish the functional role of these structures during ISG20-mediated translation inhibition. ISG20 is an important modulator of antiviral responses in vivo and in vivo. it may also explain the ISG20-susceptibility of ectopically transfected DNAs/genes. integration into the host genome or latent episomal maintenance may constitute a self mimicry defense strategy used by certain viruses. Plasmids N-terminal Flag-tagged human ISG20 mutants were produced by overlapping PCR from an original pcDNA5/FRT-Flag-ISG20 plasmid. the latter is a murine leukemia virus-based genome suitable for retroviral gene transduction. it allows for stable selection of recipient cells in which expression of the gene of interest is under the control of a modified E. coli Tet Repressor. pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was cloned into an N-terminal HA tagged IFIT1 (Gene ID: 3434) the following bicistronic vectors were used to examine the role of different IRESes. the following constructs code for a Renilla Luciferase gene under the control of the beta-globin promoter and contain or lack an intron. donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate, A-21207) and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, A-21202) from Invitrogen; CREB (4820) and Akt (9272) from Cell Technology; DDX6 (BET1300-460A) from Ozyme; anti BMRF1 (MAB8186, Merck Millipore); anti BMLF1, anti BR reactivation was induced in Hone cells upon incubation with tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and butyric acid (Ba) provided at 50 ng/ml and 3 mM, respectively.
