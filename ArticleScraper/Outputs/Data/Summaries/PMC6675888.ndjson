{"summary": "BTV is the etiologic agent of the arthropod-borne disease bluetongue (BT) transmitted to ruminants by blood-feeding midges of the genus Culicoides. it belongs to the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family. it infects a broad spectrum of wild and domestic ruminants even if sheep are the most sensitive species to the disease. ral genomic segments are associated with replication complexes containing VP1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), VP4 (capping enzyme, including methyltransferase) and VP6 (RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase) and enclosed by VP3 (subcore) and VP7 (core) (14). cell attachment and viral entry involve the two structural proteins of the outer capsid VP5 and the most variable of BTV protein VP2 representing the many viruses can modulate and hijack signaling pathways related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. in response to extracellular stimuli, several downstream components of the MAPK/ERK pathway are successively activated. ERK1/2 regulates not only transcription factors (e.g., Elk1) involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. RESULTS BTV-NS3 activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. the trans-reporter gene assay measures Elk1 activation by ERK1/2. a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity compared to unstimulated HEK-293T cells. BTV-NS3 is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway even with small amounts of plasmid (up to 10 ng) at 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved, and 6 h later EGF was added at a final concentration of 400 ng/ml. the cells were cotransfected with 300 ng of expression vectors encoding BTV ORFs in fusion with the 3FLAG tag. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 300 ng of expression vectors encoding BTV ORFs in fusion with the 3FLAG tag. at 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved for 24 h. the cells were then lysed, and the expression levels of 3FLAG-tagged BTV proteins were detected by anti-3FLAG immunoblotting. the whole purification protocol and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses revealed that BTV-NS3 copurified with BRAF in both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells. the identified peptides corresponding to BRAF are listed in Table 1. full-length BTV-NS3 (NS3FL), NS3A, and different fragments of NS3 were tested for their ability to interact with endogenous BRAF. to do so, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged NS3FL or the indicated fragments were expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified 48 h later with glutathione-Sepharose beads. NS3A was also able to bind B total cell lysates were prepared 48 h posttransfection (cell lysate; middle panel), and copurifications of endogenous BRAF were assayed by pulldown using glutathione-Sepharose beads. hek-293T cells were transfected with pFA2-Elk1, pGal4-UAS-Luc, and pRL-CMV. at 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved, and 6 HEK-293T cells were infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) and 24 h later, cells were serum starved for 12 h before being stimulated with EGF. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were markedly and reproducibly higher after BTV infection compared to the mock-infected control. the cells were serum starved and infected with WT BTV (MOI = 0.01) (A) after 12 h, the cells were stimulated with 400 ng/ml of EGF. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and eIF4E were measured at 10 min, 30 min, 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h. MDBK cells were serum starved and infected with BTV for 24 h. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 increased in an MOI-dependent manner. this is consistent to the observed for Elk1 activation in HEK-293T cells. BRAF localizations were analyzed at 24 h postinfection by fluorescence microscopy. first, in mock-infected cells, NS3 is localized in specific cytoplasmic structures evocative of the Golgi apparatus but also at the plasma membrane. similar distribution patterns were also observed in HeLa cells infected with BTV, where NS3 matched the relocalization of BRAF. HEK-293T cells treated with 20 and 10 M U0126 exhibited lower viral titers compared to the dimethyl sulfoxide control. phosphorylation of eIF4E was only inhibited at 20 and 10 M U0126. the presence of U0126 at the same concentrations also prevented expression of BTV-NS3 and -VP5. HEK-293T cells were serum starved and infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) at the time of infection, the cells were also treated with different concentrations of U0126 inhibitor, as indicated. HEK-293T cells were transfected with nonspecific or a BRAF-specific siRNA. one day later, the cells were either infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) (A and C) or transfected to express 3FLAG-tagged BTV-NS3 (B and D) after 24 h, the relative luciferase activity was determined (A and B), and cell lysates were analysed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins ( NS3 proteins from other members of the Orbivirus genus were also tested for binding to endogenous BRAF. only BTV-NS3 highly activates MAPK/ERK pathway, in contrast to EHDV-NS3, AHSV-NS3 and EEV-NS3. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding GST alone or fused to BTV8-NS3, BTV1-NS3, BTV27-NS3, EHDV the cells were serum starved for 24 h, and the relative luciferase activity was then determined. at 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved for 24 h. the experiment was performed in triplicate. NS3FL and NS3A fully blocked the IFN- promoter activity. NS31\u2013182, NS3118\u2013229, and NS3118\u2013182 were not able to activate Elk1. fragments are partially, but significantly, able to block the IFN- promoter activity. differences observed between NS3FL, NS3A, NS31\u2013182, NS3118\u2013229, or NS3118\u2013182 and the corresponding control vector pCI-neo-3FLAG were statistically significant. ns, nonsignificant differences between NS31\u2013117 and the corresponding control vector pCI-neo-3FLAG were statistically significant P 0.0005. inability of a UV-inactivated BTV to activate the luciferase reporter gene indicated that the induction of MAPK/ERK was dependent on viral replication or de novo viral protein expression. only BTV-NS3 is able to strongly activate the MAPK/ERK pathway both in the presence and in the absence of EGF stimulation. at 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved, and 6 h later EGF was added at a final concentration of 400 ng/ml. at the time of EGF stimulation, the cells were also infected with WT BTV at the indicated MOIs or UV inactivated BTV. after 24 h, the relative luciferase activity was determined. the indicated 3FLAG-tagged BTV proteins were detected by anti-3FLAG immunoblotting. the indicated 3FLAG-tagged BTV proteins were detected by anti-3FLAG immunoblotting. BRAF are members of the RAF kinase family that play a central role in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. to validate this interaction, HEK-293T cells were infected with BTV (MOI = 0.1), and BTV-NS3 was immunoprecipitated 24 h later using the same purification protocol mentioned above. HEK-293T cells were infected with BTV (MOI = 0.1) and NS3 was purified with a specific antibody 24 h after infection. hek-293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding GST alone or fused to the full-length NS3 protein (NS3FL), NS3A, or the indicated fragments and then tested for interaction with endogenous BRAF. both full-length BTV-NS3 and -NS3A are able to enhance Elk1 activation (Fig. 2D) the indicated fragments of NS3 were unable to do so, consistently with the previous pulldown assays. results demonstrate that the full-length BTV-NS3 and its NS3A isoform interact with BRAF. phosphorylation level of eIF4E was increased only at later time points after EGF stimulation. p-eIF4E decreased in the mock condition. HEK-293T cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding 3FLAG-tagged BTV-NS3 or the corresponding empty vector pCI-neo-3FLAG (B) after 12 h, the cells were stimulated with 400 ng/ml of EGF. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and eIF4E were measured at the same time points post-EGF stimulation as before. unlike BTV infection, similar phosphorylation kinetics of ERK1/2 and eIF4E were observed for BTV-NS3 expression alone. after 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and labeled with Hoechst 33258 dye to stain the nuclei and with specific antibodies for BRAF and BTV-NS3. cells were serum starved and infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) then, BTV-NS3 and BRAF localizations were analyzed. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 3FLAG-tagged BTV-NS3 or a control plasmid and treated with 20 M of MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. the molecule targets MEK1/2 that are directly activated by BRAF proteins (42). NS3-induced Elk1 activation was completely inhibited by U0126. HEK-293T cells were serum starved and infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) at the time of infection, the cells were also treated with different concentrations of U0126 inhibitor. HEK-293T cells were transfected with nonspecific or a BRAF-specific siRNA. they were either transfected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) (A and C) or transfected to express 3FLAG-tagged BTV-NS3 (B and D) they were either infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) (A and C) or transfected to express 3FLAG-tagged BTV-NS3 (B and D) GST-tagged NS3 from HEK-293T cells were expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified 48 h later with glutathione-Sepharose beads. NS3 proteins from BTV1, -8, and -27 have similar binding capacities for BRAF. NS3 proteins from other members of orbivirus genus were also tested for binding to endogenous BRAF. total cell lysates were prepared at 48 h posttransfection. copurifications of endogenous BRAF were assayed by pulldown. HEK-293T cells were transfected with pFA2-Elk1, pGal4-UAS-Luc. our team has demonstrated the major role of BTV-NS3 in counteracting the induction of the type I interferon (IFN-/) response (24). it has been reported that the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway could be associated with the inhibition of IFN-/ synthesis (43). HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pGL3 plasmid that contains the firefly luciferase reporter gene downstream of an IFN--specific promoter sequence. pRL-CMV reference plasmid contains the firefly luciferase reporter gene downstream of an IFN--specific promoter sequence, and pCI-neo-3FLAG expression vectors encoding 3FLAG alone or fused to NRIG- many viruses have been shown to modulate this pathway for their own benefit. the modulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway has been initially described for DNA tumor viruses and oncogenic retroviruses. but nononcogenic RNA viruses are also able to activate this signaling cascade even if the molecular mechanisms underlying this manipulation often remain a pending question. NS3 proteins from EHDV, AHSV, and EEV are unable to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. this suggests that BTV-NS3 is functionally distinct from other orbivirus NS3 proteins. the protein sequence is more conserved between BTV-NS3 and EHDV-NS3. in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that BTV-infected cells secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8 (51\u201357) a consequence of such production could be aggravation of the endothelial injury associated with an increased vascular permeability, as already observed in severe cases of BT disease (10, 58) these differences could be due to the fact that NS3 expression, as well as the viral titers, are not affected in cells transfected with the BRAF siRNA. our findings could correlate with data obtained with other members of the Reoviridae family. activation of the EGF signaling pathway has been correlated with increased reovirus replication and spread through the regulation of multiple steps of the infectious life cycle. mRNAs are capped like their host counterparts. it may be assumed that BTV increases the phosphorylation level of eIF4E. this stimulates cap-dependent translation to promote its own viral protein synthesis within infected cells. serum-free medium was used as an inoculum for BTV-infected cells. BTV infection was analyzed at indicated time points by fluorescence microscopy or Western blotting with specific NS3 and VP5 antibodies. expression vector pNRIG-I carrying genes for the constitutively active N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I (NRIG-I) has been used to stimulate the luciferase reporter gene downstream of an IFN--specific promoter sequence. one day later, cells were transfected with either pFA2-Elk1 and pGal4-UAS-Luc plasmids. HEK-293T cells were either infected with BTV8 WT strain or transfected with pCI-neo-3FLAG expression vectors encoding 3FLAG alone or fused to BTV-NS3FL. at 18 h postinfection or at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in lysis buffer. beads were then washed with ice-cold lysis buffer three times for 5 min on a spinning wheel. for other coaffinity purification experiments, ORFs encoding NS3 or fragments were transferred from pDONR207 to pDEST27 expression vector (Invitrogen) hek-293T cells were transfected with 300 ng of each plasmid DNA per well. sequentially extracted from the gel with 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 70% acetonitrile. samples were analyzed by using a Q-Exactive Plus coupled to a Nano-LC Proxeon 1000. protein identifications were validated using a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold calculated with the Percolator algorithm. proteins with at least two unique peptides were considered potential partners of BTV-NS3. the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. the cells were then incubated with specific BRAF antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. each experiment was repeated at least three times. wild-type (WT) strain was amplified and titrated on BSR-T7. inactivated virus was prepared by exposing live virus to 254-nm UV light. PCR products were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. in mammalian cells, GST tag and 3FLAG tag fusions were achieved using pDEST27 (Invitrogen) and pCI-neo-3FLAG vector. expression vector pNRIG-I carrying genes for the constitutively active N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I (NRIG-I) has been used to stimulate the luciferase reporter gene downstream of an IFN--specific promoter sequence. the reporter activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to the reference Renilla luciferase activity. differences were considered significant if the P value was 0.05 (*), 0.005 (**) or 0.0005 (***). HEK-293T cells were either infected with BTV8 WT strain or fused to BTV-NS3FL. beads were then washed with ice-cold lysis buffer three times for 5 min on a spinning wheel. hek-293T cells were transfected with 300 ng of each plasmid DNA per well. at 2 days posttransfection, cells were collected in PBS, incubated on ice for 20 min. g/ml sequencing-grade trypsin was extracted overnight at 37\u00b0C. peptides were sequentially extracted from the gel with 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 70% acetonitrile. digests were pooled (three per condition) according to different experimental conditions. the Swiss-Prot database (02/17) with the Homo sapiens taxonomy and a database including all of the viral proteins encoded by BTV was used in parallel. proteins with at least two unique peptides were considered potential partners of BTV-NS3 if no identifications were reported in the control condition. cells were serum starved and then infected with BTV (MOI = 0.01) at 18 h postinfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 30 min at room temperature, and then treated with PBS-glycine (0.1 M) and PBS-Triton (0.5%) for 5 min/each at room temperature."}
