{"summary": "the first line of plant immunity relies on the recognition of evolutionarily-conserved pathogen molecules known as PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) the first line of plant immunity relies on the recognition of evolutionarily-conserved pathogen molecules known as PAMPs. bacterial type three secretion system (T3SS) is one of many secretion systems deployed by Pseudomonas syringae. it provides bacteria with a robust mechanical structure which allows it to inject key molecules involved in pathogenicity directly into host cells. pathogens are devoid of such secretion systems. this class includes proteins with inhibitory functions, interfering with plant proteases and peroxidases. cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors target cytosolic components or are redirected to other organelles. the biology of infection of obligate biotrophic pathogens is rather unique due to the establishment of haustoria. a particular effector may be a virulence factor on one host and an avirulence factor on another, a situation observed even within a single plant species where interactions are race-specific. in plant immunity, the terms virulence and avirulence are mainly related to the plant\u2019s ability to resist or succumb to the pathogen, thus depending on plant genotype. flax rust AvrL567 genes are highly diverse and under diversifying selection pressure, with 12 sequence variants identified from six rust strains. they studied direct molecular interactions between L5 and L6 (two alleles of L) and their avirulence targets. rust-transferred protein 1 (RTP1) belongs to a family of effector proteins specific to the order Pucciniales. one effector is rust-transferred protein 1 (RTP1), which belongs to a family of effector proteins specific to the order Pucciniales. effectors from P. syringae have been shown to target anti-pathogenic vesicle trafficking and kinase-based recognition activity of the host. some effectors may also transit through the cytoplasm to reach their final destination (e.g., organelles) p50 helicase fragment lends support to a default presence of R-proteins in the nucleus to monitor their corresponding effectors rather than being relocalized upon effector binding. bacterial pathogens strive and multiply at low temperatures (10\u201323 \u00b0C), while PTI takes over at higher temperatures (23\u201332 \u00b0C). haRxLL3b, HaAtr13 Emoy2 and HaRxL44 localize to the nucleolus of plant cells. at least two have been found to accumulate in the nucleolus. the nucleolus is a multifunctional subcellular organelle critically involved in ribosome biogenesis. rust fungus Uromyces appendiculatus uses topographical cues for orientation and formation of infection structures. rust fungus uses topographical cues for orientation and the formation of infection structures. rust fungus uses topographical cues for orientation and the formation of infection structures. housetoria are found to be surrounded by endoplasmic reticulum, actin cytoskeleton and cytoplasm. a significant amount of tonoplast is present around these complexes. housetoria are separated from the host cytoplasm by an extrahaustorial matrix. studies have shown that the Arabidopsis nucleus stays close to H. arabidopsidis haustoria. proximity of haustoria to the nucleus enables pathogens to deliver their effectors more quickly to the nucleus for cell reprogramming. xL17 localizes to the tonoplast during infection by H. arabidopsidis. however, in the absence of the pathogen, it localizes to the tonoplast. this suggests a role for tonoplast in plant cell membrane trafficking. no effector has been reported to cause bulb-like vesicular structures. phenotypic similarity between vesicular structures from amsh3 mutants and cells hosting haustoria can be noticed. this concurring vesicular signature suggests pathogens could be targeting AMSH3 to alter the vesicular pathway. the exocyst architecture plays an important role in vesicular tethering. antimicrobial metabolites accumulate along with lytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, which stops the pathogen penetration peg. however, when the non-host fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum successfully penetrates Arabidopsis cells, PEN1 is then downregulated. functional studies of effectors by virulence assays are hindered by lack of molecular genetic approaches. in obligate biotrophs, functional studies of effectors by virulence assays are hindered by the lack of molecular genetic approaches."}
