{"summary": "the advances in deep sequencing processes provide an important new tool for the identification of novel viruses. characterization of novel full viral genomes present in clinical, animal or environmental samples is important for diagnostics, for identifying unexpected pathogens and for discovering disease etiology. studies seeking virus in sewage [13], [14] may present different set of discovery challenges including concentration of diluted starting material and the risk that virus genome assembly creates an artificial chimera. algorithms to process deep sequencing data have been devised and these are providing important advances for virus detection [15], [16]. the method has been used successfully in a number of virus detection applications [17], [18], combined with 454 deep sequencing to identify pathogens. the method is a combination of sample processing using VIDISCA enrichment for particle-protected nucleic acid and conversion of RNA to double-stranded DNA. nucleic acids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. a reverse transcription reaction with Superscript II (Invitrogen) was performed using non-ribosomal random hexamers. the first BLASTN match with an e values below 0.001 was identified. the identity of the BLAST hit was used to classify these mapped reads as viral or non-viral. at the end of each round of BLAST/GenBank retrieval/mapping, all mapped or mystery reads were removed from the readset.

SLIM was used to identify the closest full virus genomes for each sample. all reads in each sample were then mapped to the closest full genome reference using BWA [29] to give an indication of level of coverage in the data set. 426,096 norovirus 13 2,533,908 norovirus 14 1,612,944 norovirus NV_Amsterdam_1_1995 KJ194500 24.88 15 2,474,006 NANB-1 virus 16 1,614,452 norovirus NV_Amsterdam_2_1995 KJ194510 1263.51 17 3,344,548. raw sequencing data was trimmed to remove low quality reads. trimmed from the 3\u2032 end to a median Phred value of 30, resulting in a median value of 1.5106 reads/sample. a read may share identity in multiple taxa, thus the algorithm places the read in the lowest (most general) taxon that encompasses the set of all identified taxa for that read. a large proportion of the reads fail to return a significant BLAST hit. one sample contained ca. 80% reads mapping to Phyllostachys edulis. another sample had ca. 20% reads mapping to Sphingobacteria bacterium. a strategy to rapidly remove high frequency, sample-specific, non-viral reads was developed. reads mapping to the GenBank hit were removed from the dataset. reads not returning BLAST hits with an Expect value less than the threshold were placed into the unknown, mystery category. a new cycle of the process was initiated with the remaining reads. this limited the amount of computational time spent identifying and removing sequences from abundantly represented species. 100,000 random reads reads from sample 17 were processed with SLIM. for each cycle, the number of reads classified as virus, non-virus and mystery, the number of reads removed and the number of reads remaining are plotted. the mammalian viruses discovered in the 50 cycles are indicated. reads mapping to human adenovirus 43 (GenBank KC529648) and the mapping identified and removed 295 reads. the cycle 17 peak was due to a read mapping to Human adenovirus 30 (GenBank KF268335) all of the adenovirus BLASTn hits from this sample fall within the same Adenovirus species D as does the de novo assembled genomic contig from this sample. the novel genome or sub-genomic region was aligned to a broad set of reference sequences. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using PhyML version 3.0 under the general-time reversible substitution model. the HPV reference genomes are from reference [45], for the phylogenetic analysis, the ORFS for E6-E7-E1-E2-L2-L1 were concatenated. analysis and graphical presentation was performed as described in the legend to Figure 7. the genome has a low G/C content of 43.15%, similar to that reported for cosavirus (43.8%, [32]). a methionine codon at nucleotide position 746 is within a standard Kozak sequence (RNNAUGG : AATATGG) and a short stretch poly-pyrimidine is found just upstream (TTTTCCTTTT) only 5 genotypes within the cosavirus D species are known (D1 to D5, excluding the recombinant whose VP1 belongs to species E) the recombinant cosavirus E2/D is more closely related to serotype D6 than to serotype D1 (AA identity after the breakpoint of E2/D vs. D1 is 94.3%, while vs. D6 is 96.8%). NV_Amsterdam_2_1995 and NV_Amsterdam_1_1995 clustered with a norwalk-like virus from 2000. NV_Amsterdam_2_1995 clustered with the GI noroviruses. NV_Amsterdam_2_1995 is most closely related to an older calicivirus from Hawaii. a virus associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB-1) was identified in patients in the early 1980s. the disease potential of NANB-1 is still controversial and the virus is likely to be a bacteriophage [13] ranging from 1 to 42,000 were detected across the sample set. there was a strong correlation with the viral load measured by real time PCR. the results of such a taxonomic analysis are presented in Figure 4. a large proportion of reads fail to return a significant BLAST hit with a median of 69,000 of the 100,000 analyzed short reads found in the No Hit category. a strategy to rapidly remove high frequency, sample-specific, non-viral reads was developed. use SLIM to identify viral sequences. a read in the dataset is subjected to a nucleotide BLAST search. reads mapping to the GenBank hit were removed from the dataset and categorized as virus or non-virus using identifiers from the GenBank entry. the highest rate of read classification by SLIM occurred in the initial cycles. the average classification rate for cycles 1\u201310 in this sample was 549 reads/minute for the first 10 cycles. the rate for SLIM cycles 41\u201350 was 50.3 reads/minute. the three adenovirus peaks are a consequence of the stringency used for the mapping step. each peak is the consequence of the actual read returning a different adenovirus genome after BLASTn searching. reads in cycle 2 returned hits to Adenovirus 51 (GenBank JN226765) and Adenovirus 20 (GenBank JN226749) all reads for each sample were mapped to the indicated viral genomes using MUMmer [31]. the number of reads mapped to each virus (normalized for total reads in each sample) is depicted by color. the genomes identified in this study are marked in red. Figure 8. Open reading frame structure and phylogenetic analysis of the human cosavirus genome identified in this study. the adenovirus genome, although large, is double-stranded DNA. the two adenovirus genomes cluster within the group D adenoviruses. the genome has a low G/C content of 43.15%, similar to that reported for cosavirus. the closest relative to Cosavirus_Amsterdam_1994 is genotype D1 (VP1 AA sequence identity: 69.1%) the most distant is genotype D3 (54.9%), while the identity range between all other genotypes is 52.4\u201363.9%. the new genotype described here is the first member of genotype D6. the presence of HBV in fecal samples has been previously observed [10]. human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 5 samples. a partial genome from sample 12 (ca. 60% genome coverage, results not shown) a large number of reads mapping to plant viruses and to bacteriophages were identified. a virus associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB-1) was identified in patients in the early 1980s. the disease potential of NANB-1 is still controversial. virus identification algorithm SLIM uses iterative cycles of BLAST identification, clustering and read removal. a 5000 nt virus genome at 10 fold coverage requires 50,000 nt of sequence or 333, 149 nt reads. the algorithm does not require large amounts of computer memory and can be run locally on a laptop. a large fraction of the sequence data generated here was not classified by BLAST searches. a similar high level of unknown sequences (48\u201395%) in their analysis of viral samples, highlighting the challenges of identifying short read data using BLAST."}
