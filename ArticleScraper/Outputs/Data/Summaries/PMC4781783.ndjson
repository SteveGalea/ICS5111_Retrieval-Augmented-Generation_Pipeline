{"summary": "PI is a technique to achieve immediate short-term immunisation against infectious agents by administering pathogen-specific antibodies. since its introduction, it has proven to be lifesaving for many acute infections and, more recently, has also shown possible applications in cancer therapy1,3. out can offer the added value of providing specific, artificially acquired passive immunity against the local infectious agent while CBP supplied from other regions may be less effective due to strain variation of the pathogen in question6,7. but the identification, selection, and recruitment of potential donors can be difficult, as convalescent subjects must also meet donor selection criteria. notably, the use of pathogen inactivation could guarantee additional safety. influenza, chickenpox, infections by cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) viruses. animal models of influenza pneumonia have shown the benefit of CS (protection against H1 and H3 challenge), equine hyperimmune F(ab\u2019)2 globulin (protection against H5N1 challenge), and monoclonal antibodies (against H1, H3 and H5N1 challenge)30\u201332 201 units of CP containing anti-EBOV antibodies (titre of at least 1:64) were obtained and frozen. CP was also used to treat patients with argente haemorrhagic fever caused by the Junin virus38\u201341. negative findings contrast with the above mentioned claimed results in the treatment of EBOV infection. they highlighted the need for better understanding of the characteristics and titre of antibodies able to affect the course of diseases but also of the role of the recipients\u2019 immune response. the WHO has suggested reviewing and possibly relaxing donor selection criteria used in the country in question. potential donors who meet the WHO criteria of recovery from EBOV disease should then be subjected to pre-donation testing to assess their final suitability for donation. at least 24 cases of EBOV infection have been treated in Europe and the USA. many of these cases were healthcare workers who contracted EBOV in west africa. most received CP in association with multiple other experimental treatments and advanced supportive care. a new process of solvent/detergent inactivation for use on single-donor plasma or mini-pools of plasma in developing countries68 could also be exploited as an additional safety tool69. the waning of the epidemic in west africa will probably have the effect of significantly reducing the ability to obtain useful and valid evidence-based efficacy data from any of the trials planned or in progress70. many healthcare workers transferred to Europe or the USA received CP and survived but also benefited from experimental therapies and optimal supportive treatment. pathogen reduction technologies should play a key role in guaranteeing safe CP transfusion. the recent EBOV outbreak in west africa has turned the spotlight on the possible use of CP in the treatment of infectious diseases. information about the EBOV proteins targeted by the immune system during natural infections should be useful in producing effective vaccines55. rapid progress in this field could make the use of obsolete, not advantageous CP. there may be major organisational and technological challenges in complying with standard operating procedures."}
