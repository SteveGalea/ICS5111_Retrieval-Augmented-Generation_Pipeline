{"summary": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well-known human nosocomial pathogen. it causes urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and septicemia in immunocompromised individuals. in the past 20 years, a predominant, community-acquired, invasive K. pneumoniae infection type has emerged in Asia (2\u20138). the release of inflammatory cytokines can promote cell infiltration and tissue damage, which are characteristic of inflammation. the release of inflammatory cytokines can promote cell infiltration and tissue damage. inflammatory cytokines can promote cell infiltration and tissue damage. intragastric infection model mimics the clinical infection route of K. pneumoniae liver abscesses. cytokine production decreased in blood and liver tissues. 1 109 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells in 0.2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline were immediately administered through the same route (32, 33) the 70% lethal dose of K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells administered intragastrically in B6 mice was 1 109 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells. otic region present; score of 2, between 5 and 10 microabscesses in each liver section and no necrotic region present. score of 4, between 10 and 15 microabscesses in each liver section and necrotic regions present. average score for each group was generated by examination of liver sections from six mice. groups of four B6 mice were inoculated intragastrically with 5 108 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells per mouse. at 18 or 72 h, mouse serum or liver tissue homogenized in PBS was collected for the detection of cytokines. bacterial growth at different time points was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm. the bacterial suspensions were serially diluted, plated on LB agar, and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C (32) the results of one of three experiments are reported. the plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g to enhance the contact of bacteria and cells. the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C to permit phagocytosis and infection. the cells were washed and hydrolyzed with 1 ml of sterile distilled water. the results of three experiments are expressed as the mean standard deviation. statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 3.0 software. survival curves were compared for significance using log rank test. group of six B6 mice were inoculated intragastrically with 1 109 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells per mouse. liver sections were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells were incubated with various concentrations of LiCl for different times. the mucoid strings of the colonies were determined as described in Materials and Methods. the same amounts of K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells were pretreated for 3 h. K. pneumoniae NK-9 (capsular serotype K1) with hypermucoviscosity was isolated from a patient with primary liver abscesses. the animals were raised and cared for in accordance with guidelines established by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan. 109 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells in 0.2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline were immediately administered through the same route (32, 33) the animals were observed every day for a total of 9 days. the survival rates of the mice were examined for a total of 9 days. score of 4, between 10 and 15 microabscesses in each liver section and necrotic regions present. the average score for each group was generated by examination of liver sections from six mice. groups of four B6 mice were inoculated intragastrically with 5 108 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells per mouse. at 18 or 72 h, mouse serum or liver tissue homogenized in PBS was collected for the detection of cytokines. the bacterial suspensions were serially diluted, plated on LB agar, and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C (32). the results of one of three experiments are reported. the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C to permit phagocytosis and infection. after this, the free bacteria outside the cells were washed away with PBS, DMEM containing 5% FBS and 100 g/ml gentamicin was added. the cells were cultured for another 4 h or 14 h. survival curves were compared for significance using the log rank test. survival curves were compared for significance using the log rank test. treatment groups were compared for significance using the t test. Cl. groups of six B6 mice were inoculated intragastrically with 1 109 K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells per mouse. liver sections were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. effects of LiCl on the mucoid phenotype of K. pneumoniae. NK-9 cells were cultured on agar plates containing various concentrations of LiCl. the colonies were determined as described in Materials and Methods. LiCl. RESULTS LiCl inhibits K. pneumoniae-induced death. without treatment, approximately 70% of the mice died within 5 days. without treatment, approximately 70% of the mice died within 5 days. the average concentrations of LiCl in the sera were 0.33 0.04 mM and 0.61 0.03 mM. both of these concentrations were lower than the clinically acute toxic doses of LiCl (>1.2 mM) to extrapolate the oral doses of LiCl. the addition of LiCl (400 g/ml) to the drinking water for 7 days protected 70% of the mice (7 of 10 mice) from death. the addition of LiCl at 48 h postinfection had no protective effect. the results indicate that LiCl could inhibit death in this intragastric infection model. expression profiles of the cytokines were different in blood and liver tissue. results suggest that LiCl could decrease the bacterial burdens, liver impairment, and inflammation in mice.

LiCl partially enhances macrophage bactericidal activity. the effect of LiCl on macrophage bactericidal activity was examined. a previous study indicated that LiCl (>3 mM) induced macrophage apoptosis. strains from primary liver abscesses are susceptible to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides (2, 17) but constitutively resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin (38) the frequency of K. pneumoniae isolates that are resistant to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins is increasing in all regions of the united states (21). LiCl has been shown to decrease mortality rates, to various degrees, in Francisella tularensis-infected (45), Streptococcus pyogenes-infected (46), and burkholderia pseudomallei-infected (47) mice. the most effective dose of LiCl in K. pneumoniae-infected mice was 400 g per ml, which corresponds to a serum concentration of 0.33 mM. the effects of LiCl on bacterial burdens can be divided into two parts. the first is the direct effect of LiCl on K. pneumoniae NK-9 cells. previous studies indicated high doses of LiCl (>100 mM) could alter bacterial cell walls and thus viability. low doses of LiCl could inhibit the death of macrophages. by inhibiting the death of macrophages, their killing activity would be enhanced. in vitro assays showed that lithium increases the numbers of leukocytes but decreases the bactericidal capacity of granulocytes in humans. in vitro infection assay, we found that the activity in macrophages was inhibited by low doses of LiCl. nontoxic doses of LiCl were able to prevent K. pneumoniae infections in mice through modulation of K. pneumoniae itself."}
