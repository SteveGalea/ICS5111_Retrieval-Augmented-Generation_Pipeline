{"summary": "Adoptive immunotherapy with CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor\u2013modified T (CAR-T) cells administered after lymphodepletion chemotherapy is a novel treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. this approach has produced high complete response rates in ALL and high overall response rates in NHL and CLL,4-12. most patients who present for CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy have poor immune function due to the trial was conducted with approval from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Institutional Review Board. patients received a single cycle of lymphodepletion chemotherapy, followed by CAR\u2013T-cell infusion at, or as close as possible to, 1 of 3 CAR\u2013T-cell dose levels. concentration was evaluated prior to and approximately monthly after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion. immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg, IV) was recommended if the serum IgG concentration was 400 mg/dL. neurotoxicity was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. infections with 1 microorganism in 2 nonadjacent organs were counted as 2 infections. the lungs, respiratory tract, and paranasal sinuses were considered adjacent. classification of infection severity Infection severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or fatal. newtrophil recovery was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with an ANC 500 cells per mm3. analyses were performed for infections occurring between CAR\u2013T-cell infusion and day 28 given standard follow-up at our center for at least 28 days. antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of acyclovir 800 mg or valacyclovir 500 mg twice a day for herpes simplex or varicella zoster virus seropositive individuals starting on the day of lymphodepletion until 3 months after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion. trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice a day for 2 days each week starting after neutrophil recovery until 3 months after C repeated positive cultures for a given organism were considered a second event if they occurred >21 days after the initial diagnosis. if the bacterial isolate was a possible skin contaminant (eg, Diphtheroid, Bacillus, or coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species) it was excluded, unless systemic antibiotics were administered. patients were censored on the date of new antitumor therapy, the last clinical contact at our center, or death. we reported summary statistics for categorical variables along with medians and ranges for continuous variables, stratified by disease type. median age was 54 years (range, 20-73 years) prior to lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy, patients had received a median of 4 treatment regimens (range, 1-11) 50 patients had undergone prior autologous and/or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) IgG 400 mg/dL prelymphodepletion 13 (28.9) 8 (40.0) 13 (22.8) 34 (25.6) ALC 200 prelymphodepletion 40 (85.1) 12 (50.0) 54 (87.1) 106 (79.7) ANC 500 prelymphodepletion 9 (20.0) 2 (8.3) 5 (8.8) 16 (12.7) Treatment Cy/Flu lymphodepletion regimen|| 34 (72.3) 21 (87.5) 49 (79.0 one patient who received a second cycle of lymphodepletion and CAR\u2013T-cell infusion is included as 2 separate enrollments. 25 patients (18.8%) had a prior allogeneic HCT alone, 22 (16.5%) had a prior autologous HCT alone, and 3 patients (2.3%) with NHL had both. time-to-neutrophil recovery was determined from the first day on or after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion that a patient had an ANC 500 cells per mm3 until the first of 3 consecutive days with an ANC 500 cells per mm3. one patient received only tocilizumab, 7 received only corticosteroids, and 20 received both. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from 1 patient with grade 4 CRS. cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected by PCR in plasma from 1 patient with grade 4 CRS. neither patient had end-organ disease attributed to these viruses. incidence of specific infections through 28 days after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion Type of infection ALL, n = 47 CLL, n = 24 NHL, n = 62 Total, N = 133 Events No. of patients (%) Events No. of patients (%) Events No. of patients (%) Any infection 21 14 (29.8) 8 5 (20.8) 14 11 (17.7) 43 30 (22.6) Bacterial infections 13 12 (25.5) 4 4 (16.7) 7 6 (9.7) 24 22 cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus. lower respiratory tract disease in 3 of 6 events. incidence of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections between 29 and 90 days after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy results in endogenous B-cell depletion. by day 90, only 17 of 82 evaluated patients (21%) had evidence of endogenous B-cell recovery. hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 400 mg/dL) was detected in 35%, 27%, and 46% of evaluated patients between days 15 to invasive fungal infections occurred in 2 patients who previously underwent allogeneic HCT (2%), 1 of whom had an invasive mold infection. persistent disease and neutropenia were found in 48% and 22%, respectively. patients with ALL, receipt of 4 prior antitumor treatment regimens, ANC 500 cells per mm3 before CAR\u2013T-cell infusion, and a CAR\u2013T-cell dose of 2 107 cells per kg had higher infection densities. these findings indicate that patients who received more intensive antitumor therapy were at higher risk of infection after CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy. prior antitumor treatment regimens 4 vs 4 2.24 (1.10-4.54).017 3.53 (1.76-7.10).001 IgG 400 mg/dL prelymphodepletion 1.01 (0.52-1.96) ANC 500 cells per mm3 prelymphodepletion 0.75 (0.88-3.84) the incidence of infection was higher in patients who received a higher CAR\u2013T-cell dose. higher CAR\u2013T-cell dose level, more severe CRS or neurotoxicity, treatment with tocilizumab, and ICU admission were associated with increased risk for infection. the data show that most infections occurred during periods of neutropenia. patients with more severe CRS had higher risk of infection. for each increase in neurotoxicity severity category from 0 (none) to grades 1-2 to grades 3-5, there was a 3.38 increase in the hazard of infection. these were analyzed as dichotomous variables (ie, yes vs no) infection risk after CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy was higher among patients who developed more severe CRS and/or neurotoxicity. 15 of 90 patients (17%) had mild or moderate infections, 5 (6%) had severe infections, and 1 (1%) had a life-threatening infection between day 0 and 90 after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion. median age was 54 years (range, 20-73 years) clinical and treatment characteristics ALL, n = 47* CLL, n = 24 NHL, n = 62 Total, N = 133 Baseline characteristics Age, median (range), y 40 (20, 73) 61 (40, 73) 58 (28, 70) 54 (20, 73) Female 20 (42.6) 7 (29.2) 13 (21.0) 40 (30.1) White 35 (74.5) 21 (87.5) 54 (87.1) 110 (82.7) Prior antitumor treatment regimens, one patient who received a second cycle of lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR\u2013T-cell infusion is included as 2 separate enrollments. twenty-five patients (18.8%) had a prior allogeneic HCT alone, 22 (16.5%) had a prior autologous HCT alone, and 3 patients (2.3%) with NHL had both. g/m2 IV on day 1 (n = 17); etoposide 200 mg/m2 per day IV on days 2 to 4 (n = 9); flu 25 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 (n = 2); bendamustine 90 mg/m2 for 2 days (n = 1). time-to-neutrophil recovery was determined from the first day on or after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion. the first infection was identified a median of 6 days (range, 1-27 days) after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion. 80% of first infections occurred within the first 10 days. there were 43 infections in 30 of 133 patients (23%) during this period.

CTCAE grade 3 infections reported in 34% to 52% of patients with ALL, 21% to 25% with CLL, and 23% to 24% with NHL. infection densities after CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell immunotherapy compared favorably with those observed after unrelated donor myeloablative HCT. infections occurring after CAR\u2013T-cell infusion were life-threatening or severe. only 2 infections were primary or secondary causes of death. 4 infections were present prior to receiving lymphodepletion. future studies will be required to identify lymphodepletion regimens that have limited hematopoietic toxicity while still enabling robust CAR\u2013T-cell engraftment. no standardized approaches to antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens in CD19 CAR\u2013T-cell recipients. effective strategies to prevent infections in the immunocompromised host are well established in other settings. effective strategies to prevent infections in the immunocompromised host are well established in other settings.
