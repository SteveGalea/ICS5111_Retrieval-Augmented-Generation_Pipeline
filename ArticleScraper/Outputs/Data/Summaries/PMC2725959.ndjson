{"summary": "the simulation model used data from the Asian influenza A (H2N2) pandemic in 1957\u201358 (6) and from studies on US influenza-related excess rates of hospitalizations of illness and death (9\u201311). each person in the community belongs to 1 of 5 age-dependent strata: preschool children (ages birth\u20134 years), schoolchildren (ages 5\u201318 years), adults (ages 19\u201364 years), seniors (ages 65 years) living at home, and seniors (ages 65 years) living in an LTCF. the probability of transmission depends on the total duration of all contacts between 2 persons, rather than on the number of times they make a contact. the transmission parameters do not depend on the population size, and 3) different contact parameters can be specified for weekdays and weekend days. when ill persons and other household members were confined, a person returned to school or work 1 day after their illness ended. when ill persons and other household members were confined, they returned to school or work 1 day after their illness ended. a person who did not become ill returned to school or work on the third day after the last day of illness of any household member. simulation model used data from the Asian influenza A (H2N2) pandemic in 1957\u201358 (6) and from studies on US influenza-related excess rates of hospitalizations of illness and death (9\u201311). each person belongs to 1 of 5 age-dependent strata: preschool children (ages birth\u20134 years), schoolchildren (ages 5\u201318 years), adults (ages 19\u201364 years), seniors (ages 65 years) living at home, and seniors (ages 65 years) living in an LTCF. the probability that person A becomes infected depends on the following input parameters: 1) the number of different persons with whom person A has contact in each mixing group, 2) the total duration, in minutes, of all the contacts with each of these persons, and 3) the per-minute rates of infection transmission if the contacted person is infectious. ill persons only, and ill persons and all the members of the same household complied. if symptoms were severe, the person reduced his or her duration of contacts with other household members by 50%. when ill persons were confined, they returned to school or work 1 day after their illness ended. a school remained closed for a predetermined period (7, 14, or 21 days) on weekdays, household and community contact parameters of children whose school was closed were assigned their weekend levels. a given fraction of households were assumed to comply. a given fraction of households were assumed to comply. the average rates for the 3 outcomes of interest were calculated for 200 simulations and used as baseline rates. the effectiveness of each intervention was defined as follows: Effectiveness = [(baseline rate) \u2013 (rate with intervention)]/baseline rate Sensitivity Analysis We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of our findings regarding the effectiveness of the 3 modeled interventions. if each school were closed for 7 days when the proportion of ill children exceeded 10% then the overall illness rate was 0.321. the effect of the length of closure was less clear. when schools were closed, transmission in households and in the community increased. effectiveness decreased when the length of the delay was increased. a 25% reduction in contacts with ill residents was estimated to reduce the illness rate for the population by 2% and the illness rate for LTCFs by 22%. ill persons and all their household contacts are confined to their homes after the second day of illness of the index case-patient. the rate of decline following the peak does not change under confinement to home, while it slightly decreases under school closing.

32.1%. the baseline rate of hospitalization was 196.9/100,000 (95% CI 183.2\u2013210.6) and the baseline rate of death was 63.4/100,000 (95% CI 56.2\u201370.6) a delay of 1, 2, or 3 days occurred between onset of symptoms. a delay of 1, 2, or 3 days occurred between onset of symptoms. this delay and proportion of households that complied with confinement rules affected the effectiveness of the intervention. a 25% reduction in contacts with ill residents was estimated to reduce the illness rate for the population by 2% and the illness rate for LTCFs by 22%. the rate of decline following the peak does not change under confinement to home, while it slightly decreases under school closing. we found that reducing R0 resulted in an increase in the effectiveness of confinement to home and a decrease in the effectiveness of school closings. we assumed that 40% of ill persons without severe symptoms were confined to home within 2 days of symptom onset. the effectiveness of this intervention increased from 0.333 to 0.319. the alternative values we used in Table 2 modeled a more severe pandemic. school baseline contact duration, min % Ill for school closing % Effectiveness

inhibitors are most likely to be effective against a pandemic. reducing contact rates between infected and uninfected will represent one of the few sets of interventions that can be rapidly implemented. the pandemic Influenza Strategic Plan and Public Health Guidance for State and Local Partners was released on November 2, 2005 (7). if the attack rate were reduced, school closings would have an even smaller effect. the effect of school closings on overall illness rates in an influenza pandemic has been estimated in other recent studies. residents of LTCFs are likely to be at high risk for serious pandemic-related illness and death. the effectiveness of any intervention designed to reduce contact rates depends on the initial values selected for the parameters affecting influenza transmission. a limitation of our study is that few data exist on which to base these values. researchers have found that american workers routinely miss 1 day of work after reporting onset of influenzalike illness (18). encouraging longer durations of work loss could decrease compliance with self-isolation and increase the economic cost per case avoided. in this article, we assessed the effectiveness of school closures of 1\u20133 weeks. we assumed that children dismissed from schools would increase their out-of-school contacts. these assumptions reduced the effectiveness of school closures in our model. contact groups Ajkl were determined by selecting at random ciAjkl persons of stratum j from each mixing group other than the household to which Abelonged. if a mixing group had fewer than ciAjkl members of stratum j, then the contact group consisted of the entire mixing group. an ill person with severe symptoms withdrew to home, made contacts only with household members, and the duration of these contacts was decreased by 50%. we assumed that in 50% of adults and 75% of children severe symptoms developed and the person withdrew. an ill person could require hospitalization or die from influenza complications. ciAjkl, of Ajkl and the average duration in minutes, diAjkl were specified as input parameters. the initial contact groups Ajkl were determined by selecting at random ciAjkl persons of stratum j from each mixing group other than the household to which A belonged. the probability that transmission occurred during a contact of d minutes was 1 \u2013 exp \u2013d. the person A became infected if r P(inf) each newly infected person entered a latent period, at the conclusion of which the person became infectious to others. we assumed that the probability of symptoms developing was 0.67 and that an infected person who did not become ill was 50% less infectious than one who did. 0\u20134 years, 36%; 5\u201318 years, 62%; 19\u201364 years, 25%; >65 years, 21%; overall rate, 33%. transmission rates vary by the ages of the infected and susceptible persons. we then adjusted these rates so we obtained the predicted overall rates for a pandemic. cji - c and dji = d. 1.a. Weekdays Contacts in the household: c11 = 6, d11 = 60. all other contact parameters are zero. c's are twice the corresponding weekday values. we assume that person A is a susceptible school-aged child (stratum 2) who lives in a household with 2 parents (ages 19\u201364, stratum 3) and a younger preschool child (stratum 1). we now calculate the probability that A will become infected on a given weekday. the per-minute transmission rate from infectious younger child to person A is 21 = 0.00062. the per-minute transmission rates from the preschool child and from each school-aged child are 21 =0.00062 and 22 =0.00061 respectively. the overall probability that person A becomes infected on this day is 0.8485 x 0.4809 x 0.9123 = 0.6277. the rate of viral transmission per minute of contact from an infected person in stratum j to a susceptible person in stratum i was denoted by. on each day of the simulated outbreak, the model calculated for each susceptible person the probability of becoming infected that day. an ill person with severe symptoms withdrew to home, made contacts only with household members, and the duration of these contacts decreased by 50%. the probability of hospitalization and death was determined on the basis of the distribution of age-specific hospitalizations and deaths in an average seasonal (nonpandemic) influenza season (22\u201324) the initial contact groups Ajkl were determined by selecting at random ciAjkl persons of stratum j from each mixing group other than the household to which Abelonged. if a mixing group had fewer than ciAjkl members of stratum j, then the contact group consisted of the entire mixing group. the probability that transmission occurred during a contact of d minutes was 1 \u2013exp\u2013d. an ill person with severe symptoms withdrew to home, made contacts only with household members, and the duration of these contacts was decreased by 50%. we assumed that in 50% of adults and 75% of children severe symptoms developed and the person withdrew. an ill person could require hospitalization or die from influenza complications. ciAjkl, of Ajkl and the average duration in minutes, diAjkl were specified as input parameters. the initial contact groups Ajkl were determined by selecting at random ciAjkl persons of stratum j from each mixing group. the probability that transmission occurred during a contact of d minutes was 1 \u2013 exp \u2013d. an ill person with severe symptoms withdrew to home, made contacts only with household members, and the duration of these contacts was decreased by 50%. the probability of hospitalization and death was determined on the basis of the distribution of age-specific hospitalizations and deaths in an average seasonal (nonpandemic) influenza season. individuals made contact on a day of type l, where l = 1for weekdays and l = 2 for weekend days. ciAjkl, of Ajkl, and the average total duration in minutes, diAjkl, were specified as input parameters. the probability that transmission occurred during a contact of d minutes was 1 exp \u2013 d. the probability that A escaped infection from B that day was exp \u2013diAjklB. each newly infected person entered a latent period, at the conclusion of which the person became infectious to others. an ill person with severe symptoms withdrew to home, made contacts only with household members. the program determined the proportion of persons who became ill as well as the proportions of hospitalizations and deaths in the community. we ran 200 simulations and calculated the means of the above 3 proportions over these simulated epidemics. there are 5 types of mixing groups: households, daycare centers, schools, workplaces, and the community. for each combination of 2 strata (i, j) we needed to determine: (i) the number of persons from stratum jcontacted in 1 day by a person from stratum i, c, and (ii) the average total duration per day (in minutes) of all the contacts with 1 person, d. LTCF residents Each LTCF resident made contacts with 4 other residents for an average of 120 minutes (on weekdays and on weekend days) this person has contact with 1 family member for 60 minutes on weekdays and with 2 family members for 120 minutes each on weekend days. we now calculate the probability that A will become infected on a given weekday. in the community, person A makes contact with 1 preschool child (c21(community) = 1, Table A4) for a total of 30 minutes. per-minute transmission rates from the preschool child and from each school-aged child are 21 =0.00062 and 22 =0.00061, respectively. the overall probability that person A becomes infected on this day is 0.8485 x 0.4809 x 0.6277. lative contact rate when withdrawn due to \"severe\" symptoms = 0.50. transmission rates vary by the ages of the infected and susceptible persons. but not by the mixing group or by weekday versus weekend day. we assumed that each member of the household contacted every other member, so we did not specify c's. Contacts in daycare centers: c11 = 6, d11 = 60. All other contact parameters are zero. contact in schools: c22 = 10, d22 = 120. All other contact parameters are zero. household contacted every other member, so we did not specify c's. contact in daycare centers: c11 = 6, d11 = 60. contact in workplaces: c33 = 10, d33 = 120. all other contact parameters are zero. transmission rate from infectious younger child to person A is 21 = 0.00062. the total duration of the contacts with each parent is d23 = 120 minutes. the transmission rate from the infected parent is 23 = 0.00053. is the result of the assumption that all the persons with whom A makes contact on this day are infectious. if this number does not exceed 0.6277, then the simulation program determines that A becomes infected on this day."}
