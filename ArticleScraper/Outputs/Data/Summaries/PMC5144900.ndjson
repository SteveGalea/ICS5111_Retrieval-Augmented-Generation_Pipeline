{"summary": "a single index case arrived in south Korea on 4 May 2015. the index case developed symptoms 7 days later and did not receive a diagnosis of MERS until 20 May 2015. the full transmission tree comprised 150 cases linked to nosocomial events. the average reproduction number followed a declining trend, from 30 cases in the first generation to 3.8 in the second generation and 0.1 in the third generation. this outbreak followed a similar trajectory to previous hospital clusters involving coronaviruses [18]. each patient with Ebola was assigned one or several types of exposure (family/household, hospital, sexual, or funeral) a subset of representative clusters of Ebola transmission chains were extracted from internet reports. the index patient traveled from his village to Conakry to be treated after visiting and infecting a physician. 104 Ebola virus disease clusters were identified between January 2014 and January 2016. the monthly number of clusters identified from news reports tracked the total number of EVD cases reported by traditional surveillance systems during the study period. most secondary cases were linked to the index case (46.5%) and only 13.9% stemmed from first-generation cases. the transmission tree comprises 20 Ebola cases, including 11 healthcare workers. the index case generated 12 secondary cases in the first generation, 5 in the second generation, and 2 in the third generation. this led to a declining reproduction number, from 12 in the first generation to 1.0 for subsequent generations. subnational case data became available later and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in transmission patterns across west africa. the main exposure to EVD was via family contacts (58.6%), which is in line with exposure patterns from prior Ebola outbreaks [24\u201327]. transmission chains for EVD and MERS clusters indicate a rapidly declining trend in the reproduction number over disease generations. this pattern could result from a combination of factors, including changes in population behavior that mitigate transmission, characteristics of and spatial heterogeneity in the underlying network of contact over which the disease spreads, and control interventions. EVD case burden in the 3 most affected countries in west africa was well in line with summary statistics from health authorities. our work is placed in the context of a growing body of digital epidemiology studies promoting the use of nontraditional online data sources. other applications include healthMap [39], a system that extracts epidemiological outbreak data from the Internet in near real time. the development of these tools poses several challenges related to the need for systematic and integrated search, extraction, and curation of diverse Internet data sets. the analysis tool kit could include the detection of critical events (eg, effects of interventions) and visualization of temporal and spatial epidemiological patterns."}
