{"summary": "this program is intended to promote productive development of foreign investigators from low- to middle-income countries. it will dovetail with several specific research training mechanisms, including training in the NIH Intramural Visiting Fellows Program, the NIDA INVEST, or Humphrey Fellowships, and the human Frontier Science Program. the specific goal of this initiative is to provide funding opportunities for the increasing pool of foreign social and behavioral scientists, clinical investigators, nurses, and other health professionals. the term \u201csocial\u201d encompasses sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociodemographic status; to biosocial interactions; and to the various levels of social context from small groups to complex cultural systems and societal influences. the core areas of behavioral and social sciences research are those that have a major and explicit focus on the understanding of behavior and social processes. at least one additional year of research training through the NIH Intramural Visiting Fellows Program; 5) 1 year of training through an international fellowship program and 1 subsequent year of mentored research; 6) recipients of Long-Term Fellowship awards through the Human Frontier Science Program. foreign trainee researchers from low- or middle-income countries trained under NIEHS R01, R37, and P01 programs. candidates who are more than 5 years beyond their training, but who have interrupted their careers because of illness or family commitments, more than 1,600 junior scientists from almost 100 countries for periods of 1\u20135 years. the NIH D43 research training and capacity building and the U2R cooperative agreement grant mechanisms allow hundreds of foreign researchers to receive training at prominent institutions in both the united states and their home countries. all research must be performed in accordance with NIH and U.S. government regulations regarding the responsible conduct of research. this announcement precludes the support of research involving enrollment in pilot studies for clinical trials, or the actual support of clinical trials. applicants should describe potential metrics that would indicate the success of the individual researcher and the success in capacity building at the home institution. the applicant will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. this FOA will use the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) award mechanism. the complete version of this PAR is available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-07-328.html. many emerging viral diseases are zoonotic in origin; an estimated 70% of newly emerging diseases are zoonotic in origin. there are several potential colonizing niches in the body for which this concept applies. it is important to know what microbes are present, in what proportions, and how the consortium functions metabolically. this may play a critical role in determining if the microbes remain as colonizers. this FOA will not support studies on HIV or pathogens among the NIAID Category A, B & C priority pathogens. the applicant will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. Applicants must download the SF424 (R&R) application forms and the SF424 (R&R) application guide for this FOA through Grants.gov/Apply. only the forms package directly attached to a specific FOA can be used.
