{"summary": "'species jumps' have been proposed as a major source of novel pathogen introductions. many emerging human diseases are zoonotic (Kuiken et al. 2006) viruses and protozoa display a relatively high propensity for being involved in newly emerging human diseases. the degree of transmissibility between members of the new host species also appears to be a risk factor where data are available. the association between transmissibility and likelihood of emergence is not surprising. in this paper, we investigate the above factors through mathematical modelling. we ask two main questions: what types of host contact structure lead to the greatest risk of evolutionary emergence\" and how do patterns of mutation affect the risk of evolutionary emergence\" there have been two main approaches to using such models in the epidemiological literature. the network-based approach builds up the offspring distribution from underlying assumptions about the processes of host\u2013host contact and pathogen transmission. the phenomenological approach simply specifies this offspring distribution directly, without explicit consideration of the underlying contact and transmission processes through which it might arise. an infective is assumed to transmit infection to each still-susceptible contact independently with probability T, called the transmissibility, taken to be a constant. for the initial infective, who has been infected by a source outside the population, all contacts (given by the degree) remain susceptible. the approach typically uses a Poisson distribution of infections, implicitly assuming homogeneous mixing in the population. however, the key difference from the network-based approach is that (s) is effectively specified directly. contact distributions, all with mean 5, are: top row, mixed deterministic with 10% superspreaders; middle row, Poisson; bottom row, negative binomial with dispersion = 1 (i.e. geometric) the extinction probability q of the process is the smallest non-negative solution of the equation (s) = s. multiple strain model A phenomenological approach has been used to explore how pathogen evolution affects disease emergence by accounting for multiple pathogen strains. these models typically assume a Poisson distribution of infectious contacts, which, interestingly, has been found usually to be a poor fit to epidemiological data. strain j is transmitted with probability ij (j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j. the probability of extinction starting from one later-generation infective of type i, denoted qi, is obtained as the smallest non-negative root of the equation qi = i(q1,..., qm), solved simultaneously for all i (appendix D). we generally assume that strain 1 is, by definition, initially introduced to the host population. we present numerical results for the probability of emergence beginning from one later-generation infective of type 1, 1 q1. the branching process may be either indecomposable or decomposable, depending on the mutational scheme. if the epidemic persists, the complement of strains that will be present must be treated on a case-by-case basis. the pathogen must acquire m 1 point mutations, one at a time and in a fixed order. so, mutation occurs only from strain i to i + 1 or i 1. this scheme is presented by Antia et al. (2003). one-step irreversible mutations correspond to the model of Antia et al. (2003). strains 2,..., m 1 no longer represent intermediates on the path to strain m. the network-based approach and the phenomenological approach arrive at this offspring distribution in different ways. the network-based approach builds up the offspring distribution from underlying assumptions about the processes of host\u2013host contact and pathogen transmission. d = g\u2032(1) denotes the expected value of degree d. an infective is assumed to transmit infection to each still-susceptible contact independently. if d is the number of still-susceptible contacts, then the number of infections transmitted is distributed as Binomial(d, T) the approach typically uses a Poisson distribution of infections, implicitly assuming homogeneous mixing in the population. but sometimes incorporates individual heterogeneity by allowing the mean of the distribution itself to be a random variable. a negative binomial distribution with mean and dispersion (appendix A.1) then the offspring distribution will also be negative binomial with mean T and dispersion (s) = G(1 T + Ts) = (1 + (T/) (1 s)) this gives exact correspondence with the phenomenological approach of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) described above. multiple strain model A phenomenological approach has also been used to explore how pathogen evolution affects disease emergence by accounting for multiple pathogen strains. these models typically assume a Poisson distribution of infectious contacts, which has been found usually to be a poor fit to epidemiological data. a type i infective makes an infectious contact, strain j is transmitted with probability ij (j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = 1, j ij = the probability of extinction starting from one later-generation infective of type i, denoted qi, is obtained as the smallest non-negative root of the equation qi = i(q1,..., qm), solved simultaneously for all i (appendix D). we generally assume that strain 1 is, by definition, initially introduced to the host population. we present numerical results for the probability of emergence beginning from one later-generation infective of type 1, 1 q1. but these results may be extended to account for generation 0 and/or type conversion as described above. if the epidemic persists, the complement of strains that will be present must be treated on a case-by-case basis. linear mutational schemes represent single directions through strain space, where strains 2,..., m 1 are intermediates between strains 1 and m. the pathogen must acquire m 1 point mutations, one at a time and in a fixed order. mutation occurs only from strain i to i + 1. mutation can occur from strain i to either i + 1 or i 1, representing both forward and reverse point mutation (again neglecting the chance of simultaneous mutations). strain 1 is introduced, mutation may proceed from this \u2018hub\u2019 along a number of different \u2018spokes\u2019 (directions in strain space) strains 2,..., m 1 no longer represent intermediates on the path to strain m. the basic reproductive number, R0, is widely used as a predictor of when a disease has epidemic potential, as well as a descriptor of disease spread. in branching process models, the disease has a positive probability of emergence if, and only if, R0 > 1. for a given transmissibility and mean number of contacts, the contact distribution that maximizes variance thus maximizes R0. the above equation is the same as the expression for R0 given by Meyers et al. (2005), although there it is not rewritten in terms of c. in all cases, this increase is linear, but at a different rate for each contact distribution depending on the variance in contacts. this probability becomes non-zero at the point where R0 passes the critical value of one, which occurs at a different value of T for each distribution. at low values of T, the disease can persist in some host contact structures but not others. the dominant eigenvalue of the mean matrix (population R0) decreases, changing the criticality of the branching process. as reverse mutation probability increases, the dominant eigenvalue of the mean matrix (population R0) decreases, changing the criticality of the branching process. to obtain this probability, we compute the extinction probability numerically. we initiate an iteration from a point with si 1, to ensure convergence to the appropriate fixed point. the difference between successive iterations, in max norm, is less than a specified tolerance, taken to be 1012 or 1016 in the figures we present. this agrees with Sagitov and Serra's result that reverse mutation is negligible in a similar model with an arbitrary offspring distribution. q1) for various linear mutation schemes. one-step irreversible (solid black), multi-step irreversible (dashed black), interchangeable and irreversible (dot-dash black), point mutation and recombination (solid grey) and one-step recombination (solid grey) antia et al. derived the following approximation for the probability of evolution to strain m (starting from strain 1) in the case of a Poisson-distributed number of infectious transmissions and one-step irreversible mutation. the derivation in fact proceeds without reference to any features of the offspring distribution besides its mean. Iwasa et al. (2004) present approximations valid for various choices of R0,i. however, the neglected error term increases as R0,i 1, implying the approximation will break down if strain fitness approaches the critical threshold. probability of emergence (1 q1) scales as O(m1) + O(). each curve corresponds to a different value of, spaced logarithmically from 106 (bottom) to 102 (top) the probability of emergence increases with mutation rate over a wide range, before abruptly crashing to zero. this occurs because the branching process becomes subcritical once reverse mutation rate is too high, even when forward mutation rate is similarly high. this occurs because the branching process becomes subcritical once reverse mutation rate is too high, even when forward mutation rate is similarly high. the risk of mutating to a poorly adapted strain now outweighs the potential benefit of mutating to a better adapted strain. increasing reverse mutation probability independently of forward mutation probability could provide a benefit to the pathogen if the transmissibility of deleterious strains is non-zero. however, this does not appear to be the case within tested parameter ranges. in branching process models, the disease has a positive probability of emergence if, and only if, R0 > 1. it is common to compare the probability of emergence across different distributions at the same value of R0. the expectation or mean matrix M = [aij], where is the expected number of type j progeny of one type i individual, is crucial in determining criticality of the process. extinction is certain; otherwise, there is a positive probability of non-extinction and the process is classified as'supercritical' Figure 2b plots the probability of emergence versus T for each contact distribution. this probability becomes non-zero at the point where R0 passes the critical value of one. at low values of T, the disease can persist in some host contact structures. however, the probability of emergence increases at different rates for different contact structures. population R0 (dominant eigenvalue of M) changes with probability of reverse mutation. a high rate of reverse mutation from a well-adapted to a poorly adapted strain can tip the branching process from supercritical to subcritical. a high rate of reverse mutation from a well-adapted strain can tip the branching process from supercritical to subcritical. q1, we compute the extinction probability numerically, through fixed-point iterations of the offspring distribution PGF, (2.2) we initiate an iteration from a point with si 1, to ensure convergence to the appropriate fixed point, and continue until the difference between successive iterations, in max norm, is less than a specified tolerance. this agrees with Sagitov and Serra's result that reverse mutation is negligible in a similar model with an arbitrary offspring distribution. we use m = 4 strains and the jackpot model of evolution, with transmissibility of the final strain set to 0.05. forward mutation probability is = 0.01 and reverse mutation probability is = 0.01. jump-to-m probability is = 0.0001. probability of evolution to strain m (starting from strain 1) is expected to scale m1. the derivation in fact proceeds without reference to any features of the offspring distribution besides its mean. the prediction holds for all our sample contact distributions. a single \u2018escape\u2019 type (which we denote m) has R0,m > 1; all other types i m have R0,i 1. but all other mutations among types are allowed. probability of emergence (1 q1) scales as O(m1) + O(). each curve corresponds to a different value of, spaced logarithmically from 106 (bottom) to 102 (top) this occurs because the branching process becomes subcritical once reverse mutation rate is too high, even when forward mutation rate is similarly high (3.3). this occurs because the branching process becomes subcritical once reverse mutation rate is too high, even when forward mutation rate is similarly high (3.3). the risk of mutating to a poorly adapted strain outweighs the potential benefit of mutating to a better adapted strain. Adding reverse mutation at a probability equal to that of forward mutation makes negligible difference to quantitative results. we might suspect that increasing reverse mutation probability independently of forward mutation probability could provide a benefit to the pathogen if the transmissibility of deleterious strains is non-zero. a network-based model offers more detailed insights into factors contributing to pathogen fitness and probability of emergence. it lends itself to comparison of the relative impact of various public health interventions, which may act by reducing either number of contacts or probability of transmission per contact. at a transmissibility of 0.03, probability of emergence ranges from 0 to approximately 0.7. this suggests certain pathogens, having a transmissibility near the critical threshold, will be able to cause an epidemic in some host populations. the \u2018most risky\u2019 mutational pathway depends on the pathogen's initial transmissibility. probability of emergence is also sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of intermediate strains in an analytically predictable manner. emergence probability has a non-monotonic relationship with overall mutation rate. the required \u2018mutation\u2019 rate does not represent the probability of point mutation during a single replication event, but actually incorporates all factors involved in strain conversion. putting our model in a broader context could elucidate the impact of additional risk factors such as pathogen\u2013host range. clustering of contacts is expected to limit disease spread owing to reduction in availability of susceptibles. a recent analysis addressing some apparent inconsistencies in the literature suggests that the impact of clustering on the probability of an epidemic is negligible unless degree is typically small or host-based heterogeneities are large. we have implicitly assumed that any conversion of strains within an individual is instantaneous, with no possibility for co-infection. we have also ignored variation in the precise number of pathogen copies in the body. both Andr\u00e9 & Day (2005) and Handel et al. (2006) also raise this issue. at a transmissibility of 0.03, probability of emergence ranges from 0 to approximately 0.7. this suggests certain pathogens, having a transmissibility near the critical threshold, will be able to cause an epidemic in some host populations, but not others. emergence probability has a non-monotonic relationship with overall mutation rate. if this rate passes a critical point, excessive back mutation to poorly adapted strains implies that the pathogen can no longer sustain itself. this result parallels the phenomenon of \u2018error catastrophe\u2019 observed in viral quasi-species models. future directions We have modelled the spread of an emerging pathogen following its introduction to a new host species. this model does not incorporate the dynamics of the introduction itself (or possibly multiple introductions), such as interspecific interactions. however, few models to date have considered multiple species and phases in cross-over. a recent analysis addressing some apparent inconsistencies in the literature suggests that clustering on the probability of an epidemic is negligible unless degree is typically small or host-based heterogeneities are large. a second major assumption in our model is that hosts are homogeneous in terms of their epidemiological characteristics. both Andr\u00e9 & Day (2005) and Handel et al. (2006) also raise this issue, suggesting that the difficulty of obtaining direct estimates of parameters in the between-host model supports a move to modelling at the within-host level. to determine g(z), we must impose an additional assumption. we can find g(z) if we specify either p0, the probability of having zero contacts or g\u2032(1), the mean number of contacts. a negative binomial degree distribution with mean and dispersion leads to a negative binomial excess degree distribution with mean ( + 1)/ and dispersion + 1. A.3. Can G(z) be recovered from (s)\" taking (s) = sN (exactly N infections transmitted by every infective) only gives a valid PGF if T = 1, not surprisingly. some distributions of infectious transmissions can be traced back to contact distributions for arbitrary T. we can find g(z) if we specify either p0, the probability of having zero contacts, or g\u2032(1), the mean number of contacts. the distinction between generations of infectives is in fact irrelevant in many phenomenological models, which specify a Poisson distribution. the same results apply if we replace G(z) with g(z) and (s) with (s). the same results apply if we replace G(z) with g(z) and (s) with (s). taking (s) = sN (exactly N infections transmitted by every infective) only gives a valid PGF if T = 1, not surprisingly. this limitation is to be expected, given that we have constrained the number of transmissions from an individual to be distributed binomially with total number of \u2018trials\u2019 equal to the number of contacts. z G(z) = z1 (s) = (1 T + Ts)1 Poisson() Poisson(T) g(z) = exp((z 1)) G(z) = exp((z 1)) (s) = exp(T(s 1)) negative binomial(,) negative binomial( + 1)/, + 1) g(z) = (1 + (/)(1 z))) G(z) = (1 + (/)(1 z each individual has a fixed number of contacts. this leads to a binomial offspring distribution. the degree and excess degree distributions are the same. this type of distribution arises in Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005). we might interpret this distribution as arising from an infective making contacts at a constant rate (i.e. at points of a Poisson process) over a Gamma-distributed duration of infection. Variance decreases as dispersion increases; in the limit as, we get a Poisson distribution. n = 2 represents a less-frequent class of superspreaders among more-frequent \u2018normal\u2019 spreaders. each is characterized by the mutation matrix U = [ij], where ij is the probability that an infection transmitted by a type i is of type j. the PGF for a Poisson distribution is given by Brauer (2008). the PGF for a negative binomial distribution is given by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005). exp(k) = (1/) k=1n pkk exp(k (z 1)) (s) = (1/) k=1n pkk exp(k (z 1)) (s) = (1/) k=1n pkk exp(k (z 1)) (s) = (1/) k=1n pkk exp(k (z 1)) (s) = (1/) k=1n pk k exp(k T(s 1) this type of distribution arises in Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) by taking a Poisson distribution with mean drawn from a Gamma distribution. this distribution is motivated by the existence in the host population of \u2018superspreaders\u2019, who contribute an unusually large number of transmission events. authors distinguish the two cases by labelling hosts with a large number of contacts \u2018superspreaders\u2019 and those with high transmissibility \u2018supershedders\u2019. each type has a characteristic distribution of contacts, which we take to be either deterministic (the kth type has exactly k contacts) or Poisson (the kth type has a Poisson(k) distribution of contacts), where k=1n pkk =. these cases lead to a mixed binomial or the number of each type of transmission (including \u2018failed\u2019 transmissions) has a multinomial distribution with d independent \u2018trials\u2019; possible outcomes are transmission of type j (probability Tiij), for some j = 1,..., m, or no transmission (probability 1 Ti) we can then derive the offspring distribution by considering the distribution of d. extinction occurs when the population of every type reaches zero at some generation. only periodic processes are indecomposable, but fail to be positively regular (Mode 1971); however, a periodic process can be represented by a non-periodic process through a transformation of time scale. threshold theorem continues to hold in the decomposable case. qi denotes the extinction probability of a multi-type branching process. if any type is non-transmissible, clearly a process initiated by such a type will go extinct. the argument for reaching this conclusion applies to any branching process (Mode 1971); some further deductions depend on irreducibility. for an indecomposable process, is the smallest non-negative fixed point of : if 1, then, as guaranteed by the threshold theorem; while if > 1 (the supercritical case). we can solve for any fixed point by working backwards through types m, m 1,..., 1, substituting solutions for those si already found and leaving an equation in one variable only. m1(sm1, 1) is the PGF for the number of type m 1's produced by a type m. m1(1, qm) 1 is a unique solution qm1 1 satisfying m1(qm1, qm) = qm1. the argument proceeds identically as we continue to work backward through types. in most cases, we will have R0,m > 1 and R0,i 1. probability of extinction starting from a generation 0 infective of type i is given by g(1 Ti + Tij=1m ij qj) i. this means that extinction is guaranteed in this process if it is guaranteed in the processes initiated by later-generation infectives of types accessible by mutation."}
