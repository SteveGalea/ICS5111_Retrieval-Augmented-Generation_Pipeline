{"summary": "186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86) a total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions. the world health organization has been notified of 1,638 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 587 fatal cases, in 26 countries as of February 26th, 2016. these confirmed cases have been directly or indirectly linked to countries in the Arabian Peninsula. primary MERS-CoV infections are presumably associated with community zoonotic exposure and may be passed to family members via limited secondary transmission. retrospective observational study focused on clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea. all patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection were identified during the outbreak in the Republic of Korea. confirmatory tests were performed only for suspected cases. rRT-PCR tests targeted the upstream E protein (UP-E) and open reading frame 1a gene segments of MERS-CoV. a major means of obtaining data was review of medical records, including doctors' and nurses' charts, imaging findings, and laboratory results. fever AND pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiologic evidence) AND either a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset. Fever AND symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g. cough, shortness of breath) and presence in a healthcare facility (as a patient, worker, or visitor) within 14 days before symptom onset in a country in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Statistical analysis Collected data were categorized with respect to demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory test results, image findings, treatments performed, and clinical outcomes. statistical analysis Collected data were categorized with respect to demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory test results, and image findings.
