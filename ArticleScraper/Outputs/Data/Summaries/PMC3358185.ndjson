{"summary": "all patients had mild clinical courses and fulfilled the case definition for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (3). median time of hospitalization was 7 days (range 6\u201314 days) serum samples from 22 healthy persons were used to determine cytokine and antibody baseline levels. 690 cells/mm3 9/28 (32.1) 55% 4/28 (14.3) CD4 400 cells/mm3 13/28 (46.4) 31% 8/28 (28.6) CD8 190 cells/mm3 3/28 (10.7) 13% 0/28 (0) B cells 90 cells/mm3 1/28 (3.6) 6% 0/28 (0) Natural killer cells. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts of 28 patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, China. Counts and percentages are means. Error bars indicate SD. each mean value was within the reference range. serum concentrations of interferon- (IFN-), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-6 are medians. only 1 patient had an HAI antibody titer 10 (titer 20) 1 day after illness onset. serum IL-6 and IFN- levels in our study quickly decreased to baseline levels 7 days after symptom onset. these results suggest that serum IL-6 and IFN- levels may be increased in patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 within the first 3 days after symptom onset, followed by a decrease to baseline levels 5 days after symptom onset in patients with mild disease. adaptive immune responses are impaired in the initial phase after infection. these factors may help clarify the pathogenesis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus."}
