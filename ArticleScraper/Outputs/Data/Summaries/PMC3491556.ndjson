{"summary": "the world health organization reported 563 confirmed human H5N1 cases and 330 deaths as of august 2011. the virus cause widespread disease in domestic bird populations and have the capacity to cause disease in humans, which poses a threat to public health. the vaccine is immunogenic, but just as in previous H5N1 vaccine clinical trials, the overall responses were modest when H5 DNA was given without an inactivated vaccine boost. in further evaluations, this vaccine has shown promise as a prime for inactivated vaccine boosting (10). in the VRC 304 trial, doses of 1 and 4 mg were evaluated, along with a placebo, and 45 volunteers were concurrently randomized to the three study groups, with 15 volunteers per group. for all groups, the study injections were administered i.m. using a Biojector needle-free injection system on days 0, 28, and 56. plasmid contains a single closed-circular plasmid DNA macromolecule (VRC-9123), expressing Influenza A/Indonesia/5/05 HA sequence. plasmid was prepared under Good Manufacturing Practices at 4 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the endpoint titer was calculated as the most dilute serum concentration that gave an optical density of >0.2 above background. 80% inhibition serum titer was calculated relative to the signal in the absence of sera. positive ELISPOT response occurs if the background-subtracted number of spots per 106 cells exceeds 59 and the non-background-corrected mean is at least 4-fold greater than the mean negative stimulation for the sample. clinical trial VRC 304 was a phase I, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from December 2006 through March 2008. in the VRC 304 trial, doses of 1 and 4 mg were evaluated, along with a placebo. 45 volunteers were concurrently randomized into four study groups. for all groups, the study injections were administered i.m. using a Biojector needle-free injection system on days 0, 28, and 56. plasmid was expressing Influenza A/Indonesia/5/05 HA sequence. the plasmid contained a CMV/R promoter as previously described. the plasmid was prepared under Good Manufacturing Practices at 4 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) endpoint titer was calculated as the most dilute serum concentration that gave an optical density of >0.2 above background. 80% inhibition serum titer was calculated relative to the signal in the absence of sera. a positive ELISPOT response occurs if the background-subtracted number of spots per 106 cells exceeds 59. the non-background-corrected mean is at least 4-fold greater than the mean negative stimulation for the sample. in VRC 304, 56% of subjects were women, 80% were white, and 13% were African-American. 15 subjects in group 1 received three injections of a 1-mg dose. one subject was lost to follow-up after receiving all study injections. in the placebo group, one participant withdrew after one study injection. in the placebo group, one subject completed all visits except week 32. the worst severity of local reactogenicity was reported as none by 15.6%, mild by 82.2%, and moderate by 2.2% of subjects. the moderate symptoms were reported in the 1-mg and placebo groups. one placebo subject did not return any diary cards and therefore has missing reactogenicity data. 4 (36) 8 (73) 7 (64) Moderate 0 0 1 (7) 0 0 0 0 Severe 0 0 0 0 0 Swelling None 9 (60) 12 (80) 10 (67) 7 (70) 5 (45.5) 8 (73) 4 (36) Mild 6 (40) 3 (20) 5 (33) 3 (30) 6 (54.5) 3 (27) 7 (64) Moderate 0 0 0 0 0 0 Any local symptom None 1 mg i.d.
