{"summary": "coronaviruses are classified into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (4). human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E),5 human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63),5 human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) predominantly cause mild and self the lineage C Betacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the lineage B Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV both utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. however, the protein receptors for the lineage A Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are currently unknown. 9 was identified as a host cell-surface factor that facilitated MERS-CoV entry by scaffolding host cell receptors and proteases (26). knowledge of the interaction between coronavirus spikes and cell-surface host factors contributes to the understanding of coronavirus biology on many aspects, including tropism, pathogenicity, and potential intervention strategies. membrane proteins from pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5-transfected BEAS2B cells were extracted and sedimented. membrane proteins from pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5-transfected cells were extracted and sedimented. membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse isotype control and Sepharose A/G beads (lane 3). membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with a V5 mAb and protein A/G-Sepharose. precipitated beads were then washed, and protein complexes were eluted. the eluted beads were resuspended in sample loading buffer, boiled, and assessed for elution efficiency. the same set of membrane extracts was immunoprecipitated with isotype antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose. the expression of the MERS-CoV spike in the immunoprecipitated complexes was validated with Western blotting using a mouse immune serum. a series of co-immunoprecipitation assays performed in both overexpression and endogenous settings. first, BHK21 cells were transfected with GRP78\u2013V5 or the pcDNA\u2013V5 control vector. the cell lysates of the transfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with either MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG or Escherichia coli bacterial alkaline phosphatase\u2013FLAG ( the expression of pcDNA\u2013V5 empty vector failed to immunoprecipitate with MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG. in parallel, MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG did not co-IP with the abundantly expressed cell-surface protein EGFR. to this end, we obtained the membrane fraction of cells that was predominantly enriched with the plasma membrane contents of the cells. AP\u2013FLAG proteins were immunoprecipitated with overexpressed GRP78\u2013V5 or pcDNA\u2013V5 proteins pre-adsorbed on anti-V5 Sepharose beads. membrane fraction of Huh7 cells was extracted and immunoprecipitated with either MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG(lanes 1 and 3) or BAP\u2013FLAG (lane 2). our co-IP data established GRP78 as a specific binding target of the MERS-CoV spike. the protein is abundantly expressed on the surface of human and animal cells. in recent years, multiple functions of GRP78 on the cell surface have been reported, including a critical role of cell-surface GRP78 on virus entry. antibody could be attributed to the high degree of GRP78 sequence homology between mammalian species, suggesting that the protein is well conserved in mammalian cells. the ubiquitous expression of GRP78 suggested that GRP78 might play an auxiliary rather than a determining role in MERS-CoV entry. specific GRP78 expression was abundantly detected on the epithelial cells of the bronchus (Fig. 4A), bronchiole (Fig. 4B), and alveolus (Fig. 4C) double immunostaining of DPP4 and GRP78 revealed extensive co-localization of DPP4 and GRP78 among the epithelial cells lining the human airways. Huh7 and BEAS2B cells were pre-incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody. after the pre-incubation, MERS\u2013S-pseudoviruses were added to the cells. at 72 h post-inoculation, the cells were lysed and incubated with luciferase substrate. western blotting detection demonstrated that GRP78 knockdown did not affect DPP4 or CEACAM5 expression. to further evaluate the role of GRP78 in modulating MERS-CoV entry, we assessed virus growth in MERS-CoV\u2013infected BEAS2B cells. titration of GRP78 or isotype control antibodies from 0 to 2.5 g/ml was added. titration of MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus or VSV-G\u2013pseudovirus was subsequently added at a ratio of 100 LP per cell for 1 h. siRNA-treated MDM or HFL was infected with MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. after 2 h, the cells were harvested, and virus entry was evaluated. GRP78-transfected AD293 and BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. after infection, the cells were washed and incubated for another 4 h. the effect of GRP78 on MERS-CoV entry was not due to ER stress. the percentage of MERS-CoV N\u2013positive cells among GRP78-transfected cells was calculated as (%GRP78+N+ cells/%GRP78+N+ cells + %GRP78+N cells) 100%. the percentage of MERS-CoV N\u2013positive cells among GRP78-transfected cells was calculated as (%GRP78+N+ cells/(%GRP78+N+ cells + %GRP78+N cells)) 100%. the percentage of surface DPP4-positive cells decreased after MERS-CoV infection. the percentage of surface GRP78-positive cells increased from 50 to 80% after MERS-CoV infection. the results highlighted the potential relevance of GRP78 on MERS-CoV attachment onto the infected cells. 9 coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor recognition system. spike proteins from highly-related coronaviruses can recognize different cell-surface molecules. spike proteins of phylogenetically distant coronaviruses can bind same cell-surface molecule. the surface-binding efficiency of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus on RLK cells was 3-fold that on Caco2 cells. overexpression of human GRP78 in the apparently nonpermissive L929 and BHK21 cells did not render the cells permissive to HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus entry. bCoV-HKU9 cells were transfected with pcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5. Purified bCoV\u2013HKU9\u2013S1\u2013FLAG (lanes 1 and 3) or BAP\u2013FLAG proteins (lane 2) were immunoprecipitated with overexpressed GRP78\u2013V5 or pcDNA\u2013V5 proteins pre-adsorbed on anti-V5\u2013Sepharose beads. precipitated protein complex was detected using anti-V5 antibody or the anti-FLAG antibody. HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus binding was identified with an in-house mouse bCoV-HKU9 spike immune serum. the cells were then washed, fixed, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry. sialic acids and GRP78 act independently to facilitate surface attachment of MERS-CoV. neuraminidase treatment decreased MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner. however, the entry of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus was inhibited by GRP78 antibody but not neuraminidase treatment. Pseudovirus entry was quantified using a microplate reader as relative light units (RLU) data represented mean and standard deviation derived from three independent experiments. membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5. membrane extracts were boiled in sample buffer after glycine elution (lane 2). membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse isotype control and Sepharose A/G beads. the protein was identified as GRP78 with significant hits over different domains of the sequence. the membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with a V5 mAb and protein A/G-Sepharose. the precipitated beads were then washed and protein complexes were eluted with 0.1 m glycine. silver staining of the SDS-PAGE and the subsequent MS confirmed the presence of GRP78 in the precipitated MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG complex. the membrane pulldown assay identified GRP78 as a potential membrane protein specifically bound by the MERS-CoV spike. sates of GRP78\u2013V5 or empty vector transfected BHK21 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 pre-adsorbed protein A/G-Sepharose. expression of pcDNA\u2013V5 empty vector failed to immunoprecipitate with MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG. pcDNA\u2013V5 empty vector failed to immunoprecipitate with EGFR. the precipitated protein complex was detected using the anti-FLAG antibody or the anti-V5 antibody. reciprocal co-IP was performed using GRP78 as the bait protein. RP78 efficiently immunoprecipitated the MERS-CoV spike from cell lysates. the spike was not detected from mock-infected samples or from infected samples immunoprecipitated with a control isotype antibody. the reciprocal co-IP performed using the MERS-CoV spike as the bait similarly immunoprecipitated endogenous GRP78 from the infected samples. surface expression of surface GRP78 was detected in nonhuman cell lines. surface DPP4 and GRP78 were expressed at comparative levels in most measured cell lines. ubiquitous detection of GRP78 could be attributed to high degree of sequence homology between mammalian species. GRP78 is co-expressed with DPP4 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. specific GRP78 expression was abundantly detected on the epithelial cells of the bronchus, bronchiole and alveolus. the co-expression of GRP78 and DPP4 was detected in the bronchus (A), bronchiole (B), and alveolus (C). the co-expression of GRP78 and DPP4 was detected in the bronchus (A), bronchiole (B), and alveolus (C). to validate antibody blocking results, we infected Huh7 and BEAS2B cells with MERS-CoV after siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or DPP4. western blotting detection demonstrated that GRP78 knockdown did not affect DPP4 or CEACAM5 expression. a titration of GRP78 or isotype control antibodies from 0 to 2.5 g/ml was added and pre-incubated with Huh7 and BEAS2B cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. a titration of GRP78 or isotype control antibodies from 0 to 2.5 g/ml was added. siRNA-treated BEAS2B cells were infected with MERS-CoV at 0.1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cell lysates (F) and supernatants (G) were harvested at 24 and 48 h post-infection. to this end, GRP78-transfected AD293 or BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. after infection, the cells were washed, fixed, and immunolabeled for MERS-CoV N. to assess whether GRP78 could independently facilitate MERS-CoV entry, we assessed the level of MERS-CoV entry in AD293 and BHK21 cells upon GRP78 overexpression. ERS-CoV attachment, GRP78-overexpressing AD293 and BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 15 m.o.i. for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. after 2 h, cells were washed, detached with 10 mm EDTA on ice, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. we infected Huh7 cells with MERS-CoV (Fig. 7, A and B) and harvested samples for flow cytometry at 24 h post-infection. the percentage of surface GRP78-positive cells increased from 50 to 80% after MERS-CoV infection. the gate in A represented the percentage of MERS-CoV N\u2013positive cells. data represented mean and S.D. derived from three independent experiments. we first evaluated the cell tropism of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus with MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus included as a control. our data suggested that among the 10 evaluated mammalian cell lines, HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus entry was most pronounced in R. leschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells. bCoV-HKU9 cells were transfected with pcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5 (lanes 1 and 2) or empty vector (lane 3). co-IP between GRP78 and bCoV-HKU9 spike was performed using GRP78 as bait protein. HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus was inoculated on Caco2 and RLK cells at 100 LP per cell for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. after 2 h, the cells were washed, fixed, and immunolabeled. sialic acids and GRP78 act independently to facilitate surface attachment of MERS-CoV. neuraminidase treatment decreased MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner but not neuraminidase treatment. the cells were subsequently challenged with MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus. they were assessed at 72 h post-infection for pseudovirus entry. the cells were subsequently challenged with HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus. ERS-CoV\u2013nonpermissive cells demonstrated that GRP78 did not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. intriguingly, GRP78 was up-regulated upon MERS-CoV infection, which might further facilitate virus attachment among the infected cells. sialic acids and GRP78 both independently facilitated the attachment of MERS-CoV onto the cell surface. cell-surface GRP78 was identified as a co-receptor for coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) (30) and dengue virus (47) in addition, cell-surface GRP78 also facilitates the entry of Japanese encephalitis virus (29). in its capacity as an attachment factor, GRP78 may serve to concentrate virus particles on the cell surface, which may then increase the possibility of receptor-mediated virus entry. surface GRP78 expression appeared to be relatively abundant across various cell types of different tissue origin. a remarkable level of GRP78 was specifically detected on the epithelial cells along the human airways, where it was found to colocalize with DPP4. bCoV-HKU9 is a representative lineage D Betacoronavirus. the human Alphacoronavirus NL63 may be a recombinant between NL63-like viruses in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats (52). another human Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E has closely-related 229E-like coronaviruses recently isolated from dromedary camels (53). heLa, Huh7, Caco2 and VeroE6 cells maintained in modified Eagle's medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin. BHK21, L929, RLK, and HFL maintained in supplemented minimum essential medium. antibodies MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) was detected with the in-house guinea pig anti-MERS\u2013CoV N serum as described previously (32, 62) an in-house mouse anti-MERS-CoV spike immune serum was used to detect bCoV-HKU9 spike. the eGFP-tagged proteins were detected with mouse anti-V5 antibodies from Immnoway (YM3005) or ThermoFisher Scientific (R96025) secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 488/647 goat anti-guinea pig (A11073/A21450) and Alexa Fluor 488/647 goat anti-rabbit (A11008/A21245) from ThermoFisher Scientific, were used for flow cytometry. pcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5 was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector fused with V5, which resulted in pcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5. immunoaffinity purification of MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG protein Expression of FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins was previously described. the solubilized membrane proteins in the supernatant were transferred and subjected to an additional spin at 16,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. all extracts were quantitated using the Pierce BCA assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and stored in aliquots at 80 \u00b0C until used. the protein was identified as GRP78 with significant hits over different domains of the sequence. production of pseudotyped viruses Lentivirus-based coronavirus spike pseudoviruses was generated by co-transfection of 293FT cells with the pcDNA full-length spike plasmids. the cells were then lysed with the lysis buffer (Promega) on ice. luciferase substrate (Promega) was then added immediately. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. eudoviruses were inoculated to the cells for attachment at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. cells were washed twice with chilled PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. binding of the HKU9\u2013S-pseudoviruses was assessed with flow cytometry. the cells were transfected with 75 nm siRNA for 2 consecutive days.

at 37 \u00b0C. cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by immunolabeling with antibodies against GRP78 (Abcam, 21685) or DPP4 (Abcam, 28340) without cell permeabilization. flow cytometry was performed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analysed using a flow cytometer. normal human lung sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. antigen unmasking was performed by boiling tissue sections with the antigen unmasking solution from Vector Laboratories. animal anti-GRP78 was obtained from Abcam (ab21685) phages (MDMs) were

sequence of the bCoV-HKU9 (44) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. in parallel, bCoV-HKU9\u2013S1 was subcloned into the pSFV1 vector with a FLAG sequence in-frame. pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5\u2013transfected BEAS2B cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were harvested by scraping cells into HEPES solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl) cell pellets were then homogenized in membrane lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem the membrane proteins from the BEAS2B cells were immunoprecipitated with purified MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG protein, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and Sepharose A/G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific), respectively. the protein was identified as GRP78 with significant hits over different domains of the sequence. supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation in 30% sucrose solution. the
