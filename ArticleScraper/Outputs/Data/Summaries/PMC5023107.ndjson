{"summary": "high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/auto-SCT) has improved the outcomes of patients with high-risk solid tumors [1\u20133] despite advances in infection prophylaxis and treatment during HDCT/auto-SCT [6\u20139], many clinical problems including the emergence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [10], the risk of Clostridium difficile infection [11], and the high incidence of bloodstream infections [12,13] still require a period from October 2004 to December 2009 and a period from January 2010 to September 2014 were defined as early and late study period, respectively. a period from the beginning of HDCT to day 30 post-transplant and a period from day 31 to 1 year post-transplant or the day of treatment-related mortality, tumor relapse/progression, or death were defined as early and late transplant period. RVs were categorized into 2 groups according to the symptomatology and clinical outcome. low-risk group included RhV and CoV, and high-risk group included RSV, PIV, AdV, and IV. antibiotics were changed to teicoplanin and imipenem (12 years of age) or meropenem (12 years of age) all antibiotics including antifungal agents were discontinued after three consecutive days of no significant fever (37.5\u00b0C), no evidence of documented or clinically suspected infection. prophylactic acyclovir (from day 1 to the day of engraftment) was administered to prevent VZV reactivation between October 2004 and June 2005. definitions Fever was defined as isolation of a bacterial pathogen from at least one set of blood cultures drawn from a patient. a positive urine culture was defined as the growth of 105 colony-forming units/mL of a single organism in midstream or bag urine specimens. a positive urine culture was defined by urinary symptoms and/or a fever. RVs were categorized into 2 groups according to the symptomatology and clinical outcome. low-risk RV group included RhV and CoV, and high-risk RV group included RSV, PIV, AdV, and IV. Cytomegalovirus disease was diagnosed according to the published recommendations [19] prophylactic acyclovir (from day 1 to the day of engraftment) was administered to prevent VZV reactivation between October 2004 and June 2005. it has not been used since July 2005 to minimize drug toxicity during HDCT. n = 607 Median age at transplantation in months (range) 58 (7\u2013329) Diagnosis Neuroblastoma 265 (43.6%) Brain tumors 241 (39.7%) Bone and soft tissue sarcomas 43 (7.1%) Retinoblastoma 34 (5.6%) Wilms tumor 18 (3.0%) Germ cell tumors 6 (1.0%) HDCT regimens First HDCT (n = 324) CTE 162 (50.0%) CEC inclusion of total body irradiation (TBI) and/or thiotepa in the HDCT regimen was associated with longer duration of fever. otherwise, there was no difference in fever duration with respect to various clinical factors. of 43 episodes with bacteremia, 33 were caused by Gram-negative organisms. a total of 10 septic shock episodes occurred, which were caused by 9 Gram-negative bacteremias. three patients died from bacterial sepsis during early transplant period of HDCT/auto-SCT. the incidence of LRTI was higher in the high-risk RV group than in the low-risk RV group. there were 21 episodes caused by RhV, 11 by RSV, 9 by CoV, 4 by PIV, 2 by IV, 1 by AdV.
