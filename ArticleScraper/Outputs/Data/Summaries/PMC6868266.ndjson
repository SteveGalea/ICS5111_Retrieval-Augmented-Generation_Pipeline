{"summary": "adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed. its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice. expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected. ovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. this study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and/or prevention of MERS-CoV infection in humans. researchers around the world are focused on the spike protein as the main target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV. the spike protein of MERS-CoV attaches to the host dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptor, which is expressed on several types of human cells. vaccine models were constructed based on the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain region to elicit a strong and protective immune response in vitro and in vivo. dE1/E3 vaccine was designed to express the S1 domain of the spike protein of MERS-CoV isolate Hu/Jordan-20140010168/2014. experimental design Six to eight week-old male BALB/c mice (n=168) were purchased from Animal House at Jordan University of Science and Technology (Irbid-Jordan) parts were stored at 80\u00b0C for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. blood samples were drawn through facial vein route, left 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. collected sera were stored at 20\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. two microliters from the first PCR product were used as a template for the second (heminested) PCR to amplify the 1142 bp product following the first PCR conditions. the bands were visualized using an ultra-violet transilluminator. the antigen retrieval step was executed by immersing the sections in 1 reveal Decloaker reagent (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA) and heating in a microwave several times for 30 min then cool at room temperature for 15-20 min. after that, staining procedure was carried out by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions of the ABC kit. CYSSLILDY was defined as the highest potential T-cell epitope from a total of eight potential epitopes within the RBD region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of MERS-CoV genome. the second set of samples was stimulated with 50 g of non-specific stimulant phytohemagglutinin to confirm the viability and productivity of the cultured cells. the color intensity was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) the color intensity was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) Detection of mouse cytokines in cell culture supernatants. RT-PCR conditions were programmed in Rotor Gene-Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and a melting step at 55-99\u00b0C for 30 s. the vaccine was designed to express the S1 domain of the spike protein of MERS-CoV isolate Hu/Jordan-20140010168/2014. it was constructed in the Laboratories of Vector Biolabs (the Gene Delivery Company, PA, USA) heminested PCR was carried out using specific primers targeting specific sequences within the S1 region. cDNA was kept at 20\u00b0C until PCR analysis. two microliters from the first PCR product were used as a template for the second (heminested) PCR to amplify the 1142 bp product. the bands were visualized in 1.5% agarose gels using an ultra-violet transilluminator. the antigen retrieval step was executed by immersing the sections in 1 reveal Decloaker reagent (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA) and heating in a microwave several times for 30 min then cool at room temperature for 15-20 min. to eliminate the effect of internal renal biotin, 0.05% avidin was applied only on kidney sections for 15 min at room temperature. this antigen was defined as the highest potential T-cell epitope from a total of eight potential epitopes within the RBD region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of the MERS-CoV genome. the second set of samples was stimulated with 50 g of non-specific stimulant phytohemagglutinin to confirm the viability and productivity of the cultured cells. the third set of samples was not stimulated as a control set. the color intensity was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) Detection of mouse cytokines (IFN- and IL-4) in cell culture supernatant Cell culture supernatants from stimulated and non-stimulated samples were tested for the level of mouse cytokines. the pellets were used to extract total RNA using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s RT-PCR conditions were programmed in Rotor Gene-Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and a melting step at 55-99\u00b0C for 30 s. ted group but not in control groups using conventional PCR. S1 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of proximal tubule epithelium in the vaccinated mice at week 6 post first immunization but not in the control groups. a significant level of MERS-S1-specific IgG antibodies was detected in the mice sera of the vaccinated group at weeks 4 and 6 post-prime. the combined results of weeks 4 and 6 revealed that the IgG antibody response was significantly higher in the vaccinated group than in the control groups. antigen-specific stimulation resulted in a significant upregulation of IL-12 production. production of IFN- was significantly (p0.05) higher in the vaccinated group. production of IFN- was significantly (p0.05) higher in the vaccinated group. the fold change in IFN- gene expression was significantly higher than that in the control groups (Ad-CMV and PBS) however, there was a prominent increase in IFN- gene expression at week 6 post-prime in both the vaccinated and Ad-CMV groups compared to that in week 4. coV spike protein in mice tissues was detected at weeks 3 and 5 post first immunization in the kidneys and lungs of the vaccinated group but not in control groups using conventional PCR (Figure-1). Using conventional PCR, S1 expression was not detected in lung tissues in either the vaccinated or the control groups. a significant level of MERS-S1-specific IgG antibodies was detected in the mice sera of the vaccinated group at weeks 4 and 6 post-prime. the combined results of weeks 4 and 6 revealed that the IgG antibody response was significantly higher in the vaccinated group than in the control groups. production of IFN- was significantly (p0.05) higher in the vaccinated group. production of IFN- was significantly (p0.05) higher in the vaccinated group. in vitro stimulation with the MERS-specific peptide \u201cCYSSLILDY\u201d resulted in a significant upregulation. the fold change in IFN- gene expression was significantly higher than that in the control groups (Ad-CMV and PBS) however, there was a prominent increase in IFN- gene expression at week 6 post-prime in both the vaccinated and Ad-CMV groups compared to that in week 4. adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike gene was elicited in mice by immunization using a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine. the results of these studies were encouraging and showed that such vaccines may be promising to prevent the global threat of MERS-CoV infection [13,14,17,19-23]. the expression of S1 protein in kidney tissues and not in lung might be used to explain previous in vitro experiments. the adenoviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein but not the adenoviral vector with MERS in a hDPP4 mice experiment after intramuscular or intranasal injection. this supporting our finding that this construct was able to reach the lung tissues, but the S1 protein was not expressed in lung tissues. IFN- and IL-12, which represent the Th-1 response, were upregulated. IL-4, which represents the Th-2 response, was downregulated. a similar increase in IL-12 was apparent in vaccinated animals. the truncated RBD fused with the Fc portion of human IgG was able to elicit both isotypes with a relatively higher amount of the IgG2a isotype (Th1 response) adenovirus vector carrying the S1 subunit or the whole S gene was also able to induce both types of the immune response. adenoviral vector encoding the S1 subunit of the MERS-CoV genome is a promising vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection. this construct could induce production of a specific anti-S1 IgG antibody response as well as the Th1 immune response, which was evident from the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. publisher\u2019s Note Veterinary World remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published institutional affiliation."}
