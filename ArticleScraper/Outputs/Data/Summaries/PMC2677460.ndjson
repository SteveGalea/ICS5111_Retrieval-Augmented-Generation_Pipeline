{"summary": "the response is initiated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns engage cellular pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I, MDA5, or the toll-like receptors. these PRRs activate proteins such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-B. PKR is activated at the post-translational level in response to influenza virus infection. influenza virus infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking P58IPK results in increased eIF2 phosphorylation and decreased viral mRNA translation. this effect was due to P58IPK functioning through a PKR-dependent mechanism that is independent of PERK. these findings again suggested that influenza virus benefits from P58IPK activation, presumably to the detriment of the host. we infected P58IPK/ and wild-type mice with a series of doses (101 to 105 PFU) of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. phenotype was particularly pronounced at lower infectious doses. mortality was not caused by increased viral load, since viral titers in the lungs of all infected mice were similar. three P58IPK/ and wild-type mice infected with 103 PFU of PR8 were sacrificed at 1, 3, or 5 days post infection. levels of infectious virions in diaphragmatic lung homogenates were determined by triplicate plaque assay on MDCK cells. results represent the mean activity of 3 independent samplesstandard deviation. 103 (A,B, E\u2013H), 104 (I,J), or 105 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus were stained for hematoxalin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (C,D), F4/80 (E,F), influenza virus NP (G,H) or cleaved caspase 3 (I,J) at 5 days post infection. no cleaved caspase 3 was observed in the lungs of mock-infected mice. increased apoptosis in the lungs of P58IPK/ mice is consistent with previous reports of increased apoptosis. three P58IPK/ and wild-type mice were infected with 104 (A,B) or 103 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. at 1 and 3 days post infection, azygous and apical lung lobes were excised. oligonucleotide microarrays profile the host transcriptional response to infection. RNA was then isolated from left lung lobes for gene expression profiling. re-ratio tool creates new ratio experiments from existing ratio experiments. GO categories at the top of the day 3 list were characterized by the negative regulation of metabolic processes. those at the top of the day 5 list included a random assortment of biochemical processes. the top of the GSEA list for day 1 included many processes associated with the immune and inflammatory responses. all infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples. the top gene ontology categories related to the immune response were selected. an edge is placed between gene ontology categories if they share common genes. the edge's thickness increases as the number of common genes increases. three mice were mock infected or infected with 103 (A,B) or 104 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. at 1, 3, or 5 days post infection, blood serum was isolated, azygous and apical lung lobes, or left lung lobes were excised and homogenized. 18 resulted in the death of all P58IPK/ mice by day 4 post infection. this corresponded to an LD50 of 101.8 PFU for P58IPK/ mice. wild-type mice required five times the dose of r1918 to achieve fifty percent mortality. genes were expressed at a higher level in r1918-infected wild-type mice. they were induced in P58IPK/ mice in response to virus infection. but they were expressed at a lower level in r1918-infected wild-type mice. this analysis path was then used to analyze gene expression data. majority of these genes are associated with inflammatory, immune response, and cell-death pathways. both PR8 and r1918 infections result in an exaggerated inflammatory response in infected mice. all infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples. a gene set was isolated which included genes up-regulated in P58IPK/ mice as compared to mock. inflammatory-response-related (yellow shading) genes fit into both categories. three P58IPK/ and wild-type mice were infected with 10 or 100 PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. mortality was markedly increased in P58IPK/ mice. levels of infectious virions in diaphragmatic lung homogenates were determined by triplicate plaque assay on MDCK cells. microscopic examination revealed increased lung pathology in P58IPK/ mice, as compared to wild-type mice, infected with 103 PFU of PR8. 103 (A,B, E\u2013H), 104 (I,J), or 105 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus were stained for hematoxalin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (C,D), F4/80 (E,F), influenza virus NP (G,H) or cleaved caspase 3 (I,J) at 5 days post infection. increased apoptosis in the lungs of P58IPK/ mice is consistent with previous reports of increased apoptosis being a marker for fatal influenza virus infection [20] eIF2 and PKR phosphorylation in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice. three P58IPK/ and wild-type mice were infected with 104 (A,B) or 103 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. at 1 and 3 days post infection, azygous and apical lung lobes were excised. oligonucleotide microarrays profile the host transcriptional response to infection. RNA was then isolated from left lung lobes for gene expression profiling. re-ratio tool creates new ratio experiments from two or more existing ratio experiments. GO categories at the top of the day 3 list were characterized by the negative regulation of metabolic processes. those at the top of the day 5 list included a random assortment of biochemical processes. the top of the GSEA list for day 1 included many processes associated with the immune and inflammatory responses. mock-infected samples were pooled and re-ratioed to compare P58IPK/ gene expression to wild-type gene expression. the top gene ontology categories related to the immune response were selected. the edge's thickness increases as the number of common genes increases. cytokines suggest that a greater IFN and cytokine response contributes to the increased lung pathology and mortality rate associated with influenza virus infection. three P58IPK/ and wild-type mice were mock infected or infected with 103 (A,B) or 104 (C,D) PFU of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. mice by day 4 post infection and the death of all wild-type animals by day 7. this corresponds to an LD50 of 101.8 PFU for P58IPK/ mice. wild-type mice required five times the dose of r1918 to achieve fifty percent mortality. group were expressed at a lower level in r1918-infected wild-type mice. the infection-induced expression of these genes appears to be impacted by the presence or absence of P58IPK. the majority of these genes (47 of 65) are associated with inflammatory, immune response, and cell-death pathways. both PR8 and r1918 infections result in an exaggerated inflammatory response in infected mice. all infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples. a gene set was isolated which included genes up-regulated in P58IPK/ mice as compared to mock. this study shows that P58IPK plays a novel role in regulating the antiviral and inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection. in previous reports, we demonstrated that P58IPK is activated upon infection with influenza virus [32] and that P58IPK binds to and inhibits PKR [7],[33]. together, these results suggest that P58IPK activation is required for more efficient influenza virus replication in vitro. P58IPK inhibits inflammatory response via inhibition of PKR-mediated caspase activation and eIF2 phosphorylation. this inhibits the inflammatory response via its inhibition of PKR-mediated NF-B activation, which ultimately activates IFN-stimulated genes. apoptosis is induced by the over-expression of PKR. caspase 8 activation results in caspase 3 activation, resulting in apoptosis. PKR activates NF-B, which in turn activates Foxp3, IFN, and IFN. dsRNA activates both PKR and NF-B, which results in pro-inflammatory interleukins and chemokines. pathogenesis in P58IPK/ mice was marked by increased macrophage infiltration and hyaline membrane formation. infection of mice or macaques with H5N1 avian influenza viruses, or the 1918 pandemic virus, results in rapid disease and death, most likely due to an early and dysregulated host inflammatory response. a similar phenomenon is occurring in mice infected with influenza virus, where the expression profiles from wild-type mice exhibited increased expression of immune response-related genes, but not until later times post infection. our results show that P58IPK plays an important role in regulating the innate immune response. plants lacking P58IPK also exhibited increased host death. but plants do not invoke cell death as part of their immune response to virus infection. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intranasally with 100 l aliquots of PBS (control) or PBS containing 100 to 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the PR8 strain of influenza virus. three mock-infected and three wild-type C57BL/6 mice sacrificed. azygous and apical lung lobes were homogenized in mammalian extraction buffer. total protein content was determined for clarified lung homogenates using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) levels of PKR and phosphorylated PKR, 400 g of total protein from lung homogenates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing total PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C followed by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with Protein A Sepharose beads. western blotting was then performed for total PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pT451 PKR (Invitrogen) as described each parameter was graded on a scale of 0\u20134 with 0 as \"absent,\" 1 as \"slight,\" 3 as \"moderate,\" and 4 as \"severe\" the total \"lung inflammation scor\" for each mouse lung lobe was determined as the sum of the scores for each parameter, the maximum being 12. the same method described above was used to score immunohistochemical staining. each target was run in quadruplicate, with 100 ng of sample in reaction volumes of TaqMan 2 PCR Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) Genome copy numbers were normalized to -actin values determined in parallel using the equation 2CT(infected)CT(mock) gene set enrichment analysis was performed as described [24] using only those genes which were significantly regulated and not taking into consideration the first instance of the maximum enrichment score. y data are available at http://viromics.washington.edu. blood and lung tissue was collected from each mouse at the time of sacrifice. all experiments were performed in a specially separated negative-pressure HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air)-filtered biosafety level 2 laboratory. membranes were washed, incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. western blotting was performed for total PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pT451 PKR (Invitrogen) as described by the product analysis sheets. cardiac lung lobes were excised, perfused, and fixed in >10 volumes of 10% neutral-buffered formalin. 4 micron sections of lung were stained with H&E and PAS. sections were also immunostained for cleaved caspase 3 and macrophage marker F4/80. total RNA was homogenized in Solution D (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1 M -mercaptoethanol) RT-PCR was performed as previously described. microarray slide hybridization was performed using mouse oligonucleotide genome CGH arrays (G4426B; Agilent Technologies) for each infection group, expression oligonucleotide array analysis was performed using RNA isolated from lung tissue from three individual animals. all data were entered into a custom-designed relational database. at 1, 3, and 5 days post infection, cardiac lung lobes were excised and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin.
