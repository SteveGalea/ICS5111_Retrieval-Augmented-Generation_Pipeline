{"summary": "CDC estimates that there are at least 600 deaths from CRE each year in the united states. global mortality is believed to be \u201cconsiderable\u201d because biosecurity policy is a \u201cconceptual and practical minefield\u201d. antibiotic resistance is a \u201cslow-burning\u201d crisis compared with potentially pandemic viruses like influenza and coronavirus. antibiotic resistance is a \u201cslow-burning\u201d crisis compared with potentially pandemic viruses like influenza and coronavirus or bioterror events like anthrax letters or sarin gas attacks. BARDA's antibiotic initiative, the Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials (BSA) program, was established in 2010. the program focuses on developing antimicrobial products for \"treatment or prevention of disease caused by currently defined and future biological threats\" the program has already made considerable progress, with at least 7 promising antibacterial compounds in development. dual-utility strategy is used in many BARDA programs. products that are effective against biothreats will likely also show activity against their nonbiothreat cousins. one important limitation of the dual-utility approach is that BARDA must turn down proposals for certain alternative products or research. executive order calls for expansion of BSA program scope. executive order directs executive branch to coordinate efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. national action plan sets ambitious BSA goals. president's FY2016 budget proposal to Congress would double federal spending on antibiotic resistance. most of this new money is intended to fund BARDA's expanded mission. there are at least 3 challenges that must be overcome in order to fulfill this vision. the president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology proposes a separate fund dedicated to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other emerging infections. the fund would thereby reserve established \u201cBioshield\u201d funds for strictly biothreat indications. there are indications that Congress is warming to the idea of an expanded interpretation of BARDA's role, but significant reservations remain. the program sits at the nexus of the \u201chigh\u201d politics of security, the \u201clow\u201d politics of public health, and what might be called the \u201crising\u201d politics of antibiotic resistance. unless congressional leaders are convinced that BARDA's mission can and should accommodate antibiotic development, even for indications that lack biothreat indications, it is unlikely that the policy objectives outlined in the president's executive order and CARB plan will come to fruition. antibiotic resistance stakeholders will need to make a stronger, more unified effort to advocate for an expanded BSA program with dedicated federal funding. BARDA procurement contracts for biodefense products include access considerations, but the concept of antibiotic conservation would be lost. congressional support for the BSA (expanded scope or not) can come and go. continuing vigilance is needed to build and sustain political will. executive order calls for expansion of BSA program scope. president's FY2016 budget proposal would double federal spending on antibiotic resistance. most of this new money is intended to fund BARDA's expanded mission. there are at least 3 challenges that must be overcome in order to fulfill this vision. the president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology proposes a separate fund dedicated to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other emerging infections. the fund would thereby reserve established \u201cBioshield\u201d funds for strictly biothreat indications. the report does not specify whether BARDA can pursue antibiotics that lack a biothreat indication. president's antibiotic resistance initiative is unlikely to proceed at its current pace. the program sits at the nexus of the \u201chigh\u201d politics of security, the \u201clow\u201d politics of public health, and what might be called the \u201crising\u201d politics of antibiotic resistance. unless congressional leaders are convinced that BARDA's mission can and should accommodate antibiotic development, even for indications that lack biothreat indications, it is unlikely that the policy objectives outlined in the president's executive order and CARB plan antibiotic resistance stakeholders will need to make a stronger, more unified effort to advocate for an expanded BSA program with dedicated federal funding. BARDA procurement contracts for biodefense products include access considerations, but the concept of antibiotic conservation would be lost. antibiotic resistance is an imminent threat to the foundation of public health and modern medicine in the united states and globally. the need for new antibacterial products is urgent. the need for new antibacterial products is urgent."}
