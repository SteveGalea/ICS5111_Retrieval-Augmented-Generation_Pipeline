{"summary": "a questionnaire was drafted to answer queries about policies and structures governing control of zoonotic diseases in general and MERS-CoV in particular. results were presented and discussed before the survey participants and audience of the workshop. the document describes the chain of command 4 2 C. national plans for preparedness and response to MERS-CoV 6 1 B. Participation of stakeholders in preparation of national plans for preparedness and response to MERS-CoV 6 1 B. five institutions from 4 countries reported having joint committees. two countries had an active emergency supreme committee at the national level addressing MERS-CoV crisis and threat. 5 of 7 institutions indicated the presence of a joint public health\u2013veterinary authority field investigation team. two countries initiated research programs in response to the outbreak. joint laboratory diagnostic capabilities were established and identified. six institutions confirmed meeting on a regular basis. five institutions from 4 countries reported having joint committees. two countries had an active emergency supreme committee addressing MERS-CoV crisis and threat. in 4 countries, 5 of 7 institutions indicated the presence of a joint public health\u2013veterinary authority field investigation team and that MERS-CoV was jointly investigated. two countries organized an epidemiologic and disease control training course for the joint investigation team. several countries began initiating their One Health platforms and programs to enhance their capacity to manage zoonotic diseases (10,11,14\u201316) the first hindrance was the response by only 44% of surveyed institutions, a fact that limited a comprehensive analysis of the outcomes. this finding is sustained by our observation that there was a discrepancy understanding the One Health approach. disproportionate distribution of the available budget raised by the delegates might further explain the lack of integrated response. national laboratories in 66% of the countries managing and diagnosing MERS-CoV outbreaks had collaboration between medical and veterinary response. but because MERS-CoV is a GCC home-country infection, the diagnostic capacity was expected to be adequate. the key barrier fostering the One Health approach at the national level seems to be the relative lack of political will. the foundation of a permanent interministerial committee might be a key step to raise awareness of leaders and policy makers using the concept and to determine the importance of the One Health approach."}
