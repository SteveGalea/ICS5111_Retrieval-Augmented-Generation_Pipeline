{"summary": "the most deadly poxvirus, VARV, was the agent that caused smallpox, a fatal disease for which records go back more than 3500 years. the virus has spread from person to person and from country to country, causing the most severe epidemics in human history. the first strategy aiming to fight the disease was the use of VARV itself as the immunization agent. the spanish expedition was the first-ever mass vaccination campaign, 150 years before the WHO was established. CPXV and also HSPV were passed through cattle, rabbits, horses and humans and used for vaccinating against smallpox all over the globe. the latter half of the 19th century saw the emergence of microbiology and immunology as scientific disciplines. inant DNA technology revolutionized molecular biology, allowing the insertion of foreign DNA into poxvirus genomes. in 1960, homologous recombination could occur between the genomes of two replicating poxviruses. recombination could occur between the genomes of two replicating poxviruses. es have evolved in nature and in controlled laboratory environments to generate a wide variety of strains that are being used as vaccine candidates against homologous diseases such as smallpox, heterologous diseases such as rabies, hepatitis C, tuberculosis, malaria and leishmaniasis. we describe the sequences by which different poxvirus-based vaccines evolved with time, and how genetic manipulation of the poxvirus genome led to the development of vaccine candidates with wide application against CPXV has a restricted human replication phenotype that contrasts with the wide host range of VACV [26]. CPXV probably exhibits the broadest host range and the greatest genetic diversity among these poxviruses. some factors exacerbated the difficulty of identifying the origin of VACV. the original vaccine strains were derived from CPXV samples. however, Edward Jenner also believed that his vaccine was originally the agent that caused an infection in the heels of horses that he called \u201cgrease\u201d and that was suitable for human use after passingaging through cows [22,23]. a large number of manufacturers\u201471 distributed around the world\u2014were involved in the global effort to eradicate smallpox. first-Generation VACV Vaccines and the global smallpox eradication campaign. a large number of manufacturers\u201471 distributed around the world\u2014were involved in the global effort to eradicate smallpox. strains such as WR or IHD presented increased levels of pathogenicity [43] and adverse effects in humans. another vaccine was derived from NYCBH after 22 to 28 passages in cows in Wyeth Laboratories (Marietta, PA, USA) the nature of non-clonal origin of Dryvax\u00ae has been recently characterized. Tian Tan virus was the most extensively VACV strain used to vaccinate against smallpox in china since 1926. the name of \u201cTian Tan\u201d was acquired because the virus was isolated from a patient with smallpox. the virus was used in china from 1926 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1980. the last natural infection of smallpox occurred in 1977 in Somalia. eradication was possible due to vaccination, but no animal reservoir for smallpox other than humans exists. the risk scenario includes other animal poxviruses and genetically engineered manipulations of poxviruses. lister was the first VACV strain used for the production of cell-cultured derived smallpox vaccines. the virus was passaged directly from calf lymph vaccine to cells, and no further passages were performed for the generation of this vaccine. the vaccine has been used in clinical trials in Netherlands and Indonesia without producing severe complications. the first candidate was grown in cell cultures in 1968. another cell-cultured stock was developed in MRC-5 cells. dilutions up to 1/50 of CCSV vaccine showed a 100% take rate and no statistical significance differences in immunogenicity in comparison with Dryvax\u00ae. studies showed that this strain was less neurovirulent in comparison with Dryvax\u00ae, but showed similar immunogenicity in phase I clinical trials. a phase I clinical trial showed overall rates of 100% in cutaneous \u201ctake\u201d reaction and humoral and cellular immunogenicity in CJ-50300 vaccinees. preclinical studies using first- and second-generation poxvirus strains as vaccine candidates against different viral, bacterial and parasitic infectious diseases. table 3 summarizes the most relevant recombinant poxviruses used for these purposes. avipoxvirus, suipoxvirus, capripoxvirus, leporipoxvirus and parapoxvirus have also been extensively used as vaccine vectors against homologous and heterologous diseases. clinical [112] SIVmac239 Gag/Pol, SIV89.6P Env, Gag/Pol, Env, Tat/Rev (clade B), Gag/Pol, Env, Tat/Rev (clade B), IFN-, IL-2 preclinical [113,114,115,116,117,118] HIV-1 TAB9 multiepitopic polypeptide preclinical [119] MEG(4): multi-epitope gene (4 HIV HA, HA and/or NP, HA + IL-18 or IL-6, NA, HA + NA, LPAIV insert preclinical [144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161] IBDV VP2, VP2-VP4-VP3 preclinical [162,163,164,165,166] MDV glycoproteins B, E, I, preclinical studies using other pox vectors as vaccine candidates against different viral, bacterial and parasitic infectious diseases. f1 capsular antigen of Yersinia pestis preclinical [192,193,194,195,196] Rabies Glycoprotein preclinical [19,197,198,199,200].

LC16m8 was obtained in the late 1970s in Japan by passing the parental Lister strain 36 times in primary rabbit kidney (PRK) epithelial cells at low temperature (30 \u00b0C), followed by isolation of one clone (LC16) that grows to the lowest titer in monkey kidney VERO cells. LC16m8 replicates poorly in VERO cells, and formed small plaques in chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAM), PRK and LC16m8 is a safe and immunogenic attenuated smallpox vaccine in immunodeficient mice [254], rabbits [250] and non-human primates [252,253]. LC16m8 is a safe and immunogenic attenuated smallpox vaccine in immunodeficient mice [254] and vaccinia-naive humans [255,256]. LC16m8 is one of the safest live, attenuated, replication-competent vaccines. it is the sole smallpox vaccine licensed in Japan. it was recently recommended by the WHO as one of the preferred WHO smallpox vaccines to stockpile. mutants suffered large deletions of about 8 MDa at the left terminus of the viral genome [268] and alterations in some of the structural proteins with roles in the morphogenetic pathway. their genomes have been recently sequenced, showing multiple point mutations and specific gene deletions. MVA was used as a safe highly attenuated smallpox vaccine in the last decades of the smallpox eradication campaign (1968\u20131980), being inoculated into more than 120,000 people in Germany with no adverse side effects. however, high doses or multiple doses of MVA have to be administrated to elicit immune protection, compared with other smallpox vaccines such as Dryvax\u00ae. the vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic without developing clinical disease. it has not been tested directly in humans for efficacy against VARV. it has been tested against monkeypox triggering protection.

FP9 genome has been fully sequenced and found to harbor several deletions/insertions and gene modifications compared with the sequence of wild-type FWPV strains [394]. LC16m8 LC16m8 was obtained in the late 1970s in Japan by passaging the parental Lister strain 36 times in primary rabbit kidney (PRK) epithelial cells at low temperature (30 \u00b0C), followed by isolation of one clone (LC16) that grows to the lowest titer LC16m8 contains a frame-shifting single nucleotide deletion in the B5R gene. it encodes an extracellular enveloped virus protein (B5) essential for EEV formation. LC16m8 is a safe and immunogenic attenuated smallpox vaccine in immunodeficient mice [254] and vaccinia-naive humans [255,256] LC16m8 is one of the safest live, attenuated, replication-competent vaccines. it is one of the safest live, attenuated, replication-competent vaccines. it is the sole smallpox vaccine licensed in Japan. recombinant VACV DIs expressing simian immunodeficiency virus induces SIV-specific cellular and humoral immuneresponsesin mice [263,265] or immunized non-human primates. these results suggest that recombinant VACV DIs is a safe, efficient, transient replication-deficient viral vector, which can be used in a vaccine regimen for HIV-1 vaccine development. MVA lost nearly 15% (around 30 Kb) of the parental CVA genome. mainly in both left and right terminal regions with many of the genes deleted involved in the host range. in most of the cells MVA produces early, intermediate and late proteins, but only immature virions are formed. MVA lacks several VACV immunomodulatory genes involved in evasion of the host immune responses. deletion of innate immune evasion genes leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and migration of immune cells [290,291,292] which have a great influence on their ability to elicit adaptive immunity. preclinical and clinical trials using MVA vector as a vaccine candidate against different viral, bacterial and parasitic infectious diseases. target pathogen or disease Heterologous Antigen Status References Viral diseases Variola (smallpox) Whole MVA vector clinical [299,300,311] HIV/AIDS HIV-1 Gag p24 and p17 fused to 25 overlapping CTL CD8 T cell epitopes. 2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B (genotype 1a) preclinical [326] Chikungunya C, E3, E2, 6K and E1 preclinical [327] E3 and E2 preclinical [328] E3-E2, 6K-E1 or E3-E2-6K-E1 preclinical [329] Dengue Envelope (Dengue type 2 virus) IE1 preclinical [356] pp65-2, gB and IE1 (Rhesus CMV) preclinical [357,358] pp65, IE1, IE2 preclinical [359] pp65 preclinical [360] glycoproteins gH/gL, UL128, UL130 and UL131A (UL128C) preclinical [361] gH, gL, UL128, TRYP (Leishmania infantum) preclinical [389] Toxoplasmosis ROP2 preclinical [390] Chagas disease Trypanosoma cruzi TcG2 and TcG4 preclinical [391] Abbreviations: CTL: Cytotoxic T cell; HTL: Helper T lymphocyte; NHP: Non-human primates; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; FIPV: Feline infectious peritonit attenuated derivatives of FWPV (such as TROVAC or FP9) and CNPV (such as ALVAC) have been extensively tested. despite the fact that their multiplication is restricted to avian species, attenuated strains of APVs have been demonstrated to be efficacious and extremely safe vectors for mammals. gp120 linked to TM domain of HIV-1IIIB gp41, HIV-1IIIB Gag and protease, 3 CTL-dense regions of HIV-1LAI pol, 2 CTL-dense regions of HIV-1LAI nef clinical [425] CRF01_AE gp120 (92TH023) linked to TM domain of HIV-1LAI gp41, HIV-1IIIB Gag and protease clinical [404,426, VP2 and VP5 preclinical [463] AIV HA preclinical [465] Parasitic diseases FP9 Malaria CS preclinical [466] ME-TRAP, CS clinical [468,469,470,471,472,473,474] ALVAC Malaria CS, SSP2, LSA1, MSP1, SERA, AMA1, Pfs25 CS, SSP2, AMA1, MSP1 preclinical [47 TROVAC For the generation of TROVAC, the attenuated fowlpox vaccine strain FP-1 [103], derived from the Duvette strain, was subjected to four successive plaque purifications. then, one plaque isolate was amplified in primary CEF cells and a viral stock, designated as TROVAC, was generated and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection. 5.5.3. ALVAC ALVAC is a plaque-purified clone FP-1 [103] was subjected to four successive plaque purifications. one plaque isolate was amplified in primary CEF cells. a viral stock, designated as TROVAC, was generated and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection. several recombinant poxviruses have been generated and used as effective vector systems for vaccination-expressing heterologous antigens. the genetic modifications normally attenuated the virus and led to an increase in immunogenicity against the VACV antigens or against the heterologous antigens expressed from the poxvirus vector. recombinants are underintensepreclinical and clinical investigation as recombinant vaccines against multiple infectious diseases. the resultant vector exhibits a dramatically reduced ability to replicate on a variety of human and mammalian cell types. the vector is highly attenuated since it fails to disseminate in immunodeficient mice. clade C trimeric soluble gp140(ZM96)-Pol-Nef(CN54) as VLPs preclinical [498] Env, Gag-Pol-Nef (clade B) clinical [499,500,501,502,503] Env, Gag-Pol-Nef (clade B) clinical [504,505] AIV HA preclinical [408] HTLV-1 Env, Env + Gag deletions of other immunomodulatory genes have no effect on the virulence or pathogenicity against VACV. deletions of other immunomodulatory genes have no effect on the virulence or pathogenicity. insertion of a heterologous antigen in a poxvirus vector with the deletion of an immunomodulatory VACV gene is a promising novel approach to optimize the poxvirus vaccine vector by enhancing immunogenicity against the foreign antigen [481]. this strategy has been widely used for the generation of optimized recombinant MVA and NYVAC vectors lacking VACV immunomodulatory genes have been tested in mice [327,516,527,528,529,530,531,532 Poxvirus Deleted Gene Function Status References MVA HIV/AIDS HIV-1 Env, Gag-Pol-Nef (clade B) A41L/B16R: secreted chemokine-binding protein B16R: secreted interleukin-1 binding protein preclinical [528] HIV-1 Env, Gag-Pol-Nef (clade B) C6L IRF3 inhibitor preclinical [527,529] HIV-1 Env HIV-1 Env, Gag-Pol-Nef (clade C) A46R Inhibitor of TLR signaling preclinical [530] MVA Chikungunya C-E1-E2-6K-E3 C6L/K7R/A46R C6L: Inhibitor of MHC class II antigen presentation preclinical [517] MVA Smallpox - A41L Secreted chemokine-binding protein gene signatures of a replication-competent NYVAC vector in human dendritic cells have been described [542]. the gene signatures of a replication-competent NYVAC vector expressing HIV-1 genes have been described. insertion of mouse interleukin-4 by a recombinant ectromelia virus suppressed antiviral cell-mediated immune responses. insertion of this Th2 cytokine into several poxviruses significantly increased the efficiency of the recombinant virus as a pathogen by directly inhibiting the development of Th1 immunity. the vaccinia modified H5 (mH5) [366] and the vaccinia short synthetic early-late pS [562] promoters have been used as alternatives to p7.5 to increase the quantity of heterologous antigen expressed during infection. in VACV, 90% of the antigens most recognized by CD8 T cells were ranked among the top 50% in terms of mRNA expression. new promoters are able to increase expression of heterologous antigens and their specific immune response compared to the p7.5 and pS. they represent excellent prototypes for the generation of safe poxvirus recombinant-based vaccines to potentiate the antigen expression and immune response. deletion of VACV genes involved in immune-modulation, host-range and accessory nucleotide metabolism genes is one of the techniques that has been widely used to generate novel poxvirus vectors NYVAC-based recombinants are underintensepreclinical and clinical investigation as recombinant vaccines against multiple infectious diseases. despite its limited replication in human and most mammalian cells, NYVAC provides a high level of gene expression and triggers antigen-specific immune responses.
