{"summary": "children aged 5 years hospitalized with respiratory illness. we tested respiratory specimens for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus and rhinoviruses using rRT-PCR. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) primary viral etiological agents for childhood ALRI are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) four hospitals selected from 12 icddr,b surveillance hospitals based on geographical diversity and high turnover of patients within the influenza surveillance project. investigators identified primary catchment areas as the areas where the majority of the patients resided (an arbitrary cut-off of sub-districts where >60% of the patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms resided) surveillance days increased from once every two weeks to once every week. children aged 5 years were hospitalized on the sampling day. they did not have any respiratory symptoms in the 7-14 days preceding hospitalization or on the day of admission. the health care utilization survey was conducted as part of a larger health care utilization survey. we assumed 0.6% of the people living in the hospital catchments areas had acute respiratory symptoms. we included a design effect of 2.5 to account for clustering effect. data analyses We used census data from 2011[21] to estimate the number of children aged 5 years living in the primary catchments areas. we assumed an annual population growth rate of 1.3% [21] to estimate the population in the catchment areas during 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. we randomly selected a sample of size ni from the number of children sampled during each month. we combined the random samples from the 12 months of a year to obtain a nonparametric bootstrap sample. we repeated the three steps 10,000 times and took the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from the estimated values of the parameter to calculate the 95% CI. four hospitals selected from 12 icddr,b surveillance hospitals based on geographical diversity and high turnover of patients within the influenza surveillance project. investigators identified the primary catchment areas of the hospitals as the areas where the majority of the patients resided. surveillance physicians in each surveillance hospital enrolled all children aged 5 years residing in the primary catchment area. they followed each enrolled child throughout hospitalization and collected clinical information using a structured questionnaire. we assumed that influenza and RSV-associated deaths would most frequently occur within two weeks of illness [18]. the surveillance hospitals were chosen from four geographically diverse areas of the country. one of the four hospitals was private which adjusted for the variation in care between private and public facilities. the level of care provided in each of the surveillance hospitals was similar. s were tested for RSV, PIV types 1\u20133, HMPV, influenza viruses (influenza A and B), rhinovirus and adenovirus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. but due to logistical constraints we could not test the samples for rhinovirus in 2014. to account for variation in hospitalization on week days compared to weekly holidays, we accounted for the difference in the estimated number of hospitalizations on week days. we randomly selected a sample of size ni from the number of children sampled during each month. we then combined the random samples from the 12 months of a year to obtain a nonparametric bootstrap sample. icddr,b (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) approved the research protocol. CDC reviewed and approved reliance on icddr,b\u2019s IRB approval. four hospitals were selected from 12 icddr,b surveillance hospitals. surveillance physicians in each surveillance hospital enrolled all children aged 5 years residing in the primary catchment area and hospitalized with any two of the following symptoms. if a household did not consent to participate or was not present at the time of the survey, we skipped the next two closest households and approached the third household. the surveillance hospitals were chosen from four geographically diverse areas of the country. one of the four hospitals was private which adjusted for the variation in care between private and public facilities. all children who met our case definition were approached for participation in the surveillance to minimize selection bias. samples were tested for influenza viruses (influenza A and B), rhinovirus and adenovirus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. we assumed an annual population growth rate of 1.3% [21] to estimate the population in the primary catchments areas of the hospitals. adenovirus, PIVs, HMPV or influenza-associated respiratory infection by the year-specific census population aged 5 years. we accounted for the difference in the estimated number of hospitalizations on week days compared to weekly holidays. to calculate confidence intervals, we randomly selected a sample of size ni from the number of children sampled during each month. 155 children hospitalized with respiratory illness in 2010, 209 in 2011,153 in 2012, 128 in 2013, and 184 in 2014. of the 829 children, 580 (70%) were male. median age for children enrolled in 2010, 2011, 2012,was 5 months, for 2014 was 4 months. most commonly had laboratory-confirmed RSV

from January 2010 through December 2014, we identified 13 deaths. of the 13 death cases 6 (46%) were male and the median age was 3 months. one of the 197 children with laboratory-confirmed RSV died within 14 days. influenza activity peaked during June-July which is the rainy season in Bangladesh. there was no clear distinct seasonality for the other viruses. estimated number (95% CI)*

the interview. of the 26 children who were hospitalized with respiratory symptoms, 14 (54%) were male. the incidence over the four-year period of surveillance was highest for RSV associated

major contributors to childhood respiratory hospitalization in Bangladesh. approximately 80,345 (95% CI 79,790\u201380,902) children in 2014 were hospitalized with respiratory virus associated acute respiratory illness in Bangladesh. rates of RSV and influenza associated respiratory illness among hospitalized children aged 5 years were comparable to rates in other low and middle income countries. a high rate of RSV-associated hospitalizations in 2010 was reported from the country in the same year. despite the small numbers of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, 35% of all influenza positive children were aged 6 months. influenza is a vaccine preventable disease and maternal immunization against influenza protects children against influenza illness until they are eligible for vaccination at age 6 months. the frequency of laboratory-confirmed infection with HMPV was 4% among hospitalized children with respiratory illness. the detection rate of HMPV, however, was 13% among hospitalized children with respiratory illness in neighboring India [43]. the health utilization survey was only done once in 2013, but it is unlikely that proportion of children seeking care at the surveillance hospitals would have changed over time. male children were hospitalized more frequently than female children. male sex has also been identified as a risk factor for severe respiratory infection. we did not follow the asymptomatic children while they were hospitalized to see if they subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. the children were already hospitalized and we collected nasal and throat swabs from them through minimally invasive procedure so we believe unwillingness to participate in the surveillance might have been negligible."}
