{"summary": "an estimated 180 million people worldwide are infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the majority of infected patients (70 to 80%) develop chronic infection that leads to progressive liver disease (1). lack of availability of this HCV therapy in developing countries illustrates the urgent need to design a safe and efficient HCV vaccine. aa 412 to 423 adopts a -hairpin in complex with three independent broadly neutralizing antibodies (HCV1, AP33, and Hu5B3.v3) the antigenic site spanning aa 412 to 423 contains highly conserved epitopes targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) neutralizing HCV strains of all major genotypes (19\u201323) a comparative functional analysis of Fab fragments derived from NAbs 3/11 and AP33 reveals similar neutralization activities for both NAbs and Fab fragments in spite of strikingly different binding kinetics. our results illustrate the structural flexibility of this region within HCV E2. HCVcc of H77/JFH-1 and J6/JFH-1 were produced as previously described. a mutant HCV J6/JFH1 clone lacking HVR1 (aa 384 to 410) was generated by using plasmid pFL-J6/JFH1 as the template (29) and the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (primers are available upon request) infectivity in lysed cells was determined after 48 h by reading the luciferase activity in lysed cells (Promega) a synthetic peptide comprising residues 412 to 423 (QLINTNGSWHVN) of genotype 1a strain Glasgow was synthesized by the American Peptide Company. a complex containing 1.5 mg/ml peptide plus 9 mg/ml Fab was formed overnight at 293 K. number of complexes per asymmetric unit, resolution limits, data collection details, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.

TABLE 2. Data collection and refinement statistics Parameter Value for complexa Fab 3/11 + peptide reported under PDB accession no. 4WHY Fab 3/11 + peptide reported under PDB accession no. 4WHT Data collection statistics Space group P21 P1 No. of complexes per AUb 4 12 the crystal structures of the Fab complexes were determined by the molecular replacement method using Phaser (35) we used separate variable and constant regions of a hypothetical Fab fragment assembled from the best sequence match in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the light chain (LC) and the heavy chain (HC) reported under PDB accession number 3EOT. assays were performed by using a Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 25\u00b0C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) these Fab fragments were covalently coupled to the carboxy methyl moieties of CM5 sensorchips. 3/11 and AP33 (1.5 to 1,500 nM) were injected over the HCV sE2 surfaces. the surface was regenerated by two 1-min washes with 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) and one wash with 0.1% SDS. the real-time interaction profiles were double referenced by using Scrubber 2.0 software. sE2426\u2013717 was bound to the column, followed by an extensive wash step. a 3-fold molar excess of the large extracellular loop of human CD81 (CD81-LEL) was added. a Fab fragment (e137) (42) or MAb CBH-4D (43) directed against HCV E2 was added. the structure of the Fab 3/11-peptide complex was determined by the molecular replacement method. differences maps calculated after refinement of the recombinant Fab molecules revealed well-defined electron density for the peptide. the peptide conformation is identical in all complexes in the asymmetric unit (4 and 12 complexes in space groups P21 and P1, respectively) strain H77 J6 Fab 3/11 0.43 (8.48) 2.57 (50.65) MAb 3/11 0.39 (2.6) 1.89 (12.6) Fab AP33 0.57 (10.98) 0.83 (15.98) MAb AP33 0.23 (1.53) 1.05 (7) Control IgG 61.76 (411.73) 107.3 (715.33) a IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration. the peptide (orange) adopts an extended conformation and interacts with a composite omit map of the Fab 3/11-peptide complex contoured at 1, allowing for manual building of the peptide model. the peptide is shown as sticks and is colored by atom type (orange, red, and blue for carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, respectively) arrows indicate asparagine residues N417 and N423 that carry N-linked glycans in the infectious virus particle. clear electron density was observed for all peptide residues, indicating a highly ordered interface. the N-terminal part of the peptide interacts mostly with the light chain. the central part of the peptide comprising residues N415 to S419 bulges out, resulting in the side chains of N417 and S419 being exposed. the backbone atoms of the peptides bound to Fab 3/11 (B) and Fab HCV1 (C) are shown as sticks. the five hydrogen bonds stabilizing the backbone conformation in both structures are indicated as dotted lines. analysis of the mean temperature factors (B-factors) per residue suggested a higher degree of disorder at both ends of the peptide. N415D mutation shifts the N-linked glycosylation site from N417 to N415 (17), where the glycan chain cannot be accommodated within the interface. this is due to an electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged side chains of the aspartic acid and E31 within the CDR-L1. all four antibodies neutralize HCV infection by inhibiting the E2-CD81 interaction. both conformations can be accessible at the virus surface, likely in a dynamic equilibrium that can be shifted into either direction by antibody binding. one possible explanation for the observed difference in peptide conformations is that the epitope structure depends on the polypeptide sequence downstream of the antigenic site. a more detailed interpretation will require further experiments to analyze MAb interactions with infectious virus particles in a quantitative and time-resolved manner. affinity of Fabs 3/11 and AP33 for their epitope peptide and native soluble E2. Fab AP33 bound the peptide with a lower affinity than did Fab 3/11 (Kd, 50.9 nM) but bound wt sE2 with an 2-fold-higher affinity (Kd, 38 nM) the binding was in both cases characterized by faster association and dissociation than for Fab 3/11 (Fig. 5B and C) b koff values were determined by globally fitting dissociation profiles alone. kon and Kd values were determined by globally fitting association and dissociation profiles simultaneously. real-time SPR analysis of the interaction of epitope peptides derived from genotype 1a strain Glasgow and H77 with immobilized Fab fragments. the respective epitope peptide was injected over a surface of covalently immobilized Fab at a flow rate of 50 l/ml. a similar relationship was reported for affinity-maturated Fab molecules against envelope protein F of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), where kon was the crucial kinetic parameter that determined the biological activity of the IgG molecules. slow dissociation increased the overall affinity but did not improve the neutralizing capacity. MAbs and patient sera targeting the CD81 binding site within E2 neutralize HVR1 HCVcc more efficiently than they neutralize wt virus (54). both Fab AP33 and MAb AP33 neutralized HVR1 virus more efficiently than they neutralized wt virus (54). this difference was more pronounced for MAb AP33 (9-fold) than for the Fab fragment (2-fold) sE2 HVR1 in complex with Fab 3/11 efficiently bound the Fab 3/11-sE2 HVR1 complex by a coprecipitation assay. sE2 HVR1 in complex with Fab 3/11 efficiently bound the CBH-4D antibody (Fig. 6A), indicating that 3/11 binding does not affect the overall fold of the glycoprotein. Western blot analysis of HCVpp using the linear anti-E2 MAb ALP98 reveals similar E2 incorporation levels for wt and mutant HCVpp. a plasmid encoding a chimeric J6/JFH-1 virus was used as the template for the deletion of amino acids 384 to 425. Fab CBH-4D bound sE2426\u2013717, but no interaction between sE2426\u2013717 and Fab e137 or CD81-LEL was observed. the role of aa 412 to 425 in the viral cycle was further investigated by using retroviral particles pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins. structural flexibility displayed by antigenic site at aa 412 to 423 confirms that this region of E2 is not part of a structured domain. the peptide chain attached to N417 requires the peptide chain to adopt an extended conformation to allow binding of MAb 3/11. this indicates that this extended conformation is present at the surface of infectious particles during virus entry. the majority of monoclonal antibodies characterized so far recognize the -hairpin. our SPR analysis highlights differences in the kinetic behaviors of MAbs 3/11 and AP33 binding wt sE2 and sE2 HVR1 respectively, suggesting that the -hairpin might be the predominant conformation. the structure of the Fab 3/11-peptide complex was determined by the molecular replacement method (Fig. 2A), using the variable and constant regions of unrelated Fab fragments as separate search models. differences maps calculated after refinement of the recombinant Fab molecules revealed well-defined electron density for the peptide. the peptide conformation is identical in all complexes in the asymmetric unit (4 and 12 complexes in space groups P21 and P1, respectively) AP33a Antibody IC50 (g/ml) for strain H77 J6 Fab 3/11 0.43 (8.48) 2.57 (50.65) MAb 3/11 0.39 (2.6) 1.89 (12.6) Fab AP33 0.57 (10.98) 0.83 (15.98) MAb AP33 0.23 (1.53) 1.05 (7) Control IgG 61.76 (411.73) 107.3 (715.33) a IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration. a composite omit map of the Fab 3/11-peptide complex contoured at 1, allowing for manual building of the peptide model. the peptide is shown as sticks and is colored by atom type (orange, red, and blue for carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, respectively) arrows indicate asparagine residues N417 and N423 that carry N-linked glycans. clear electron density was observed for all peptide residues, indicating a highly ordered interface. the N-terminal part of the peptide interacts mostly with the light chain. its C-terminal part makes a right-angle turn around complementarity-determining region 2 of the heavy chain. can chains containing two N-acetylglucosamine moieties and one mannose moiety are modeled to visualize the extended conformation of the native glycoprotein required for 3/11 binding. the backbone atoms of the peptides bound to aa 412 to 423 are shown as sticks and colored by atom type (green, red, and blue for carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, respectively) the N415D mutation shifts the N-linked glycosylation site from N417 to N415 (17), where the glycan chain cannot be accommodated within the interface. this is due to an electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged side chains of the aspartic acid and E31 within the CDR-L1. all four antibodies binding to aa 412 to 423 at the virus surface will contribute to neutralization by shifting the equilibrium into the respective direction. a possible explanation could be a conformational change that E2, in particular the antigenic site spanning aa 412 to 423, undergoes during virus entry. AP33, Hu5B3.v3, and 3/11 neutralize HCV infection by interfering with CD81 binding (19, 21, 47), suggesting they all neutralize HCV upstream of the E2-CD81 interaction. a more detailed interpretation will require further experiments to analyze MAb interactions with infectious virus particles. Fab AP33 bound the peptide with a lower affinity than did Fab 3/11 (Kd, 50.9 nM) but bound wt sE2 with an 2-fold-higher affinity (Kd, 38 nM) the binding was in both cases characterized by faster association and dissociation than for Fab 3/11 (Fig. 5B and C) s1) SE koff (s1) SE Kd (nM) (SE) \u201cGlasgow\u201d peptide over: Fab AP33a,b 5.9 105 0.5 105 3.1 102 0.2 102 55.3 (3.6) Fab 3/11a,b 4.6 105 0.4 105 3.6 103 0.3 103 7.9 (0.7) \u201cH77\u201d peptide over: sE2b 4.1 103 2.7 104 65 Fabs were injected over covalently immobilized Fab at a flow rate of 50 l/ml. binding response in resonance units (RU) recorded as a function of time. a similar relationship was reported for affinity-maturated Fab molecules against envelope protein F of respiratory syncytial virus. kon was the crucial kinetic parameter that determined the biological activity of the IgG molecules. slow dissociation increased the overall affinity but did not improve the neutralizing capacity. MAbs and patient sera targeting the CD81 binding site within E2 neutralize HVR1 HCVcc more efficiently than they neutralize wt virus. both Fab AP33 and MAb AP33 neutralized HVR1 virus more efficiently than they neutralized wt virus. this difference was more pronounced for MAb AP33 (9-fold) than for the Fab fragment (2-fold) sE2 HVR1 in complex with Fab 3/11 efficiently bound the Fab 3/11-sE2 HVR1 complex by a coprecipitation assay. sE2 HVR1 in complex with Fab 3/11 efficiently bound the CBH-4D antibody (Fig. 6A), indicating that 3/11 binding does not affect the overall fold of the glycoprotein. Western blot analysis of HCVpp using anti-E2 MAb ALP98 reveals similar E2 incorporation levels for wt and mutant HCVpp. a plasmid encoding a chimeric J6/JFH-1 virus was used as the template for the deletion of amino acids 384 to 425. sE2426\u2013717 and Fab fragments derived from nonoverlapping conformation-sensitive human MAbs (CBH-4D and e137) no interaction between sE2426\u2013717 and Fab e137 or CD81-LEL was observed. sE2426\u2013717 adopts a native overall fold but binding capacity of its CD81 binding site is impaired. structural flexibility displayed by antigenic site at aa 412 to 423. glycan chain attached to N417 requires peptide chain to adopt extended conformation to allow binding of MAb 3/11. this indicates that the N-terminal 40 residues within E2 are structurally flexible. the majority of monoclonal antibodies characterized so far recognize the -hairpin. the -hairpin might be the predominant conformation that could be stabilized by interactions within E2 and/or E1 at the virus surface."}
