{"summary": "virions are a container with structural proteins and DNA or RNA genomes inside, sometimes wrapped with a lipid membrane and sugars. infection is a complex subversion process, which gives rise to latent, persistent or lytic outcomes, and cell survival or death. adenovirus (A), influenza virus (B), herpesvirus (C), human immunodeficiency virus (D) and simian virus 40 (E) enter into the cytoplasm either by a direct fusion of viral membrane and host plasma membrane (PM), or by receptor-mediated endocytosis, endosome rupture, or endoplasmic reticulum penetration. mechanical forces from the virus\u2013motor protein interactions and opposing forces, such as actin-anchored integr virions dissociate their genome from the capsid before the genome enters the nucleus. newly assembled particles leave the infected cell by mechanisms that unanimously require the assistance of the host cell. this is essential because diffusion purely depends on the thermal energy, and does not suffice for effective transport of particles larger than 50 nm across the crowded cytosol. thynyl-modified nucleosides Microtubules, plasma membrane, actin, clathrin-coated pits, nuclear pore complexes [62,63,64,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73] canine Parvovirus Parvoviridae Small organic dye (Cy3, AlexaFluor) Clathrin-coated pits [74,75] Echovirus-1 ( asfarviridae p54 peptide aa149-161 tagged liposomes Microtubules [86] Avian leucosis virus (ALV) Retroviridae MLV Gag-CFP, pseudotyped with ALV EnvA Filopodia, plasma membrane, actin, cytonemes [87] Chikungunya strain LS3-226A Togaviridae Lipophilic dye DiD Clathrin- virus like particles Hepadnaviridae Hepatitis B surface antigen particle (HBsAg) Actin [98] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Flaviviridae Lipophilic dye DiD Actin [99] Influenza virus A X-31 (IAV) Ortho-myxoviridae Lipophilic dye DiD, R18 Plasma membrane, actin, cytonemes microtubules [101,102] Murine leukemia virus mCherry-E2 Virus budding from plasma membrane [114] Uukuniemi virus (UUKV) Phenuiviridae Small organic dyes Cell surface, actin [115] Vaccinia virus (VV) Poxviridae Intracellular mature virus (IEV) EGFP-A5 Ethynyl-modified nucleosides Microtubules, actin, macropinosomes, plasma membrane, act similar results were reported with label-free virus particles by ultrahigh-speed scattering-based imaging. similar results were reported with label-free virus particles by ultrahigh-speed scattering-based imaging. the diffusion constants (D) of AdV particles in extracellular medium are in the range of about 10 m2/s. virions move outside of cell in quasi two-dimensional diffusive motions for several seconds until their motion gets confined to small areas of a few hundred nanometers in diameter. fluorophore-tagged retroviruses, such as HIV, murine leukemia virus (MLV) or avian leukosis virus (ALV) were shown to drift along filopodia. infected cells include actin polymerisation-mediated movement of incoming baculovirus across the cytosol to where the virions eventually reach the cell nucleus [139], the involvement of dynamic F-actin in the entry of influenza A virus into polarized epithelial cells. actin-dependent intracellular movement of poliovirus and VV particles may aid in the transmission of virus particles between cells. microtubules are composed of different isotypes of alpha and beta tubulin. the specific chemistry of the \u201ctubulin code\u201d facilitates functional diversification. viruses use and modify the tubulin code by signalling to microtubules. Virion dismantling by the Cytoskeleton on the Way in Viruses are too large to efficiently diffuse through the crowded cytoplasm [175]. they evolved mechanisms to take advantage of cellular transport processes, which not only affect subcellular localization but also exert force on the particles. virions can detach from microtubules in order to bind to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in the nucleus of postmitotic cells. this is of key importance for herpes viruses, HIV, parvoviruses, IV viral ribonucleo-protein complexes. dynein and myosin motors dissociate from the endosomal membrane. membrane penetration depended on acetylated microtubules. the destabilization of the HIV capsid was reported to depend on microtubules and dynein motor activity. -C2) [63] Real time light scattering of gold nanoparticle coated viruses High image contrast and temporal resolution Limited availability of labels respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [111] Total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) [195] Illumination of a few 100nm thin layer reduces background signal Only cover glass attached basal membrane is accessible Murine polyoma virus like particles [196], AdV-C2 [27] Confocal microscopy Good multi-dimensional electron microscopy has a spatial resolution in the range of several hundred nanometers. single particle tracking at high signal to noise ratio is thus possible at low tens of nanometer accuracy, and is providing unprecedented information. fluorescence complementation informs about virion proximity to cytoplasmic proteins of interest. fluorescent AdV particles were shown early on to use the microtubule-dependent transport system to traffic to the nucleus and uncoat the genome at the nuclear pore complex [29,63,224] fluorescence microscopy revealed actin-dependent virus entry and fluorophore-tagged human papillomavirus (HPV) 31 pseudovirions. superresolution fluorescence microscopy has been used to gain subcellular localization information of virions and viral genomes in chemically fixed cells with single particle resolution. this has demonstrated, for example, that cytosolic AdV particles are leaky containers that have undergone limited disassembly. label-free microscopy based on interferometry is a technique which records an interference pattern of superimposing electromagnetic waves following interaction with an object. coherent brightfield microscopy (COBRIM) detects scattered light by imaging-based interferometry. it can be combined with digital image processing and post-processing to remove background scatter noise from cellular structures. single particle tracking experiments are analyzed in three distinct steps. diffraction limited viral particles are detected in time-lapse image series. time-resolved particle positions are recorded, and particle motion is classified. imaging modalities used for virus tracking range from wide field microscopy to total internal reflection microscopy. trackers were assessed in an unbiased \u201cgrand-challenge\u201d on synthetic and real data, including virus motion. the goal for research groups was to independently apply their algorithms on a set of test cases. tracking of heterogeneous and crowded motions of virions remains challenging. cell surface motion was classified in diffusion (cyan), slow drift (red), fast drift (orange), confined motion (black) and not classified steps (blue) the segmented tracks in panel A were derived from previously published data, and adapted with permission from Elsevier [27] the most commonly used trajectory classification describes the speeds of the entire tracks, or domains within heterogeneous tracks. for example, the reported transport speeds of virions on microtubules covered a wide range of speeds for different viruses. small viruses like FMDV (25\u201330 nm) and AdV (90 nm) moved at maximum speeds of 1\u20132 m/s. larger rabies virus (180 nm) and VV intracellular enveloped particle (IEV) were transported at speeds around 0.5 m/s. speed reduction could be explained by increased drag forces on particles with larger radii in agreement with the Stokes law.

Similarly, hidden Markov models were used to extract dynamic colocalization events from multi-channel image data in case of HIV membrane fusion events [285]. a general mathematical model for stop-and-go virus motion on microtubules was proposed. the model also allowed predictions of the number of active motors attached to single virions during fast directed motions. the model also allowed predictions of the number of active motors attached to single virions during fast directed motions. open questions and challenges comprise virus trafficking studies in cultured cells, primary cells and tissues. deciphering of how cytokines, chemokines and other signalling molecules affect the way viruses use the cytoskeleton and tune cytoskeletal dynamics will inform passive and active pro- and anti-viral mechanisms. deep analyses of virion motions in cells will further inform on mechanisms of cell heterogeneity of infection."}
