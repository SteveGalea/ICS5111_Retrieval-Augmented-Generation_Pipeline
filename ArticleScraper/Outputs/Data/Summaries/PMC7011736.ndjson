{"summary": "the entire length of the respiratory system is roughly divided into the upper (nasal passages, pharynx, larynx) and lower (trachea, bronchial tree, lungs) components with a cumulative mucosal surface area that exceeds 140 m2. the entire length of the system contains a physical barrier made up of liquid and cell layers. olar macrophages are found in the lower airways and alveoli. the epithelia of the respiratory system can be considered the regulatory point of immune responses at the respiratory mucosa. the mucosal barrier is multifunctional providing a physical barrier, secretory barrier, and immune defense. s of IAV are based on the characteristics of surface expressed glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which regulate viral binding and release during its life cycle within host cells. environmental factors also play an important role in the distribution of mucosal secretions that contain infectious virions. the linkage of sialic acid to the galactose could be either -2,3 (recognized by avian viruses) or -2,6 (recognized by human viruses) since sialic acid receptors are present as a heterogenous mix on epithelial cells in different species. IAV infection disrupts epithelial barrier by causing reduced expression of occludin, claudin-4, and JAM soon after infection. the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV plays a key role in virulence as the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of NS1 binds to the PDZ domain present in TJ proteins (25) which then destabilizes junctional integrity. infected epithelia that present viral antigen-loaded MHC-I molecules are targeted by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells for destruction (34). some ciliated and alveolar epithelial cells downregulate MHC-I and evade CD8+ T cell-mediated death to survive the IAV infection. epithelial cell-derived transforming growth factor (TGF)- can be activated by viral NA (44) and can reduce the activity of Na,K-ATPase (45). cytokines from the infected epithelial cells regulate the tone of the immune response through activation of these resident cells. type I, type II, and type III IFNs are important in antiviral defense against IAV, type I and III are produced by the epithelia (50) the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) is expressed on a variety of leukocytes in addition to the airway epithelial cells (AECs) allowing them to be responsive to IFN and IFN (51, 52) a virus-induced depletion of AMs in the lungs left the host vulnerable to invading opportunistic bacteria (69). Mice deficient in AMs are more susceptible to severe influenza due to increased infection of type I pneumocytes and diffuse alveolar damage (70). GM-CSF (71\u201373) is largely produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells during influenza (74, 75) and mice deficient in GM-CSF (Csf plasmacytoid DCs are known to produce high amounts of type I IFN during IAV infection through the TLR7/MyD88 pathway (82, 83) similar crosstalk occurs between pDCs and AMs wherein pDCs control the number and cytokine profile of the AMs. to produce IL-5 and IL-13 in response to epithelial cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (91) there is no direct evidence that IAV-mediated ILC accumulation is dependent on AEC-derived cytokines. the role in tissue homeostasis is implied in studies wherein ILC depletion was shown to impact lung function, epithelial integrity and tissue remodeling. the airway epithelium consists of ciliated and non-ciliated cells overlaid by two layers of mucus. a bottom layer of less viscous periciliary liquid (PCL) allows free ciliary movement. the mucus layer is rich in various highly polymeric mucins (10), antimicrobial peptides (12), neutralizing antibodies (12), etc. that serve as a biochemical barrier. the physical manifestation of a barrier is afforded by three types of junctional proteins in the epithelia: tight junctions (TJ), adherens junctions (AJ) and aberrant repair processes. the role of TJs is well-characterized during influenza virus pathogenesis. the main viral countermeasure to these epithelial responses is the induction of epithelial cell death (28). infected epithelia that present viral antigen-loaded MHC-I molecules are targeted by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells for destruction (34) which is a major mechanism of viral clearance in the lungs. alveolar epithelia are also susceptible to IAV infection. ion channels such as amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are present on the apical surface of the pneumocytes (37, 38) and Na,K-ATPase present at the basolateral membranes (38, 39) indirect communication between the epithelia and these resident leukocytes by means of cytokines may be of greater significance than direct interaction during influenza. early release of cytokines from the infected epithelial cells regulate the immune response through activation of these resident cells. all three types of IFNs (type I, type II, and type III) are important in antiviral defense against IAV. a sudden and excessive production of cytokines can cause alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, bronchopneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome through damage to the mucosal epithelia. the importance of AMs to all stages of respiratory immunity during influenza was highlighted by Ghoneim et al. macrophages maintain environmental homeostasis through removal of apoptotic cells and debris. AMs are also important during the tissue repair phase that follows an active infection by IAV through the efferocytosis of dying epithelia and neutrophils. highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV can directly activate T cells inducing the upregulation of CD69 expression and enhancing IFN- secretion (89). T cells produce IL-17A in response to IAV that triggers the release of IL-33 by AECs which in turn mediates ILC2s and Treg cells (88). both NKT-cells and AMs have also been shown to produce IL-33. increased levels of IL-5 during the viral clearance phase may help recruit eosinophils to the airway mucosal barrier (95). increased levels of IL-5 during the viral clearance phase may help recruit eosinophils. IAV-induced epithelial cell death may expose the basement membrane to which S. pneumoniae can bind to and use as a shortcut to the bloodstream. pneumococci can migrate to the lungs and establish symptomatic infections such as pneumonia and bacteremia (123). a recent IAV infection reduces the velocity of ciliary beating and causes death of ciliated tracheal cells. IAV regulates binding receptors for S. pneumoniae on the epithelium. many viruses, including IAV, can increase the prevalence of host platelet activating factor receptor (PAFr) the disruption of TJs during influenza permits S. pneumoniae to migrate from the airways to the bloodstream. Pneumococci can also enter the blood from the airways by transmigrating through epithelial and endothelial cells. the most profound changes to the transcriptome following pneumococcal infection coincide with clearance of colonizing bacteria in an experimental human pneumococcal carriage model. IL-17 and a TH17 response at the mucosal epithelium participate in pneumococcal clearance in the nasopharynx and lungs by recruiting monocytes and neutrophils. early induction of type I IFN by AMs, DCs and AECs is of fundamental importance to antiviral immunity during influenza (150\u2013154) mice lacking IFNAR signaling have fewer bacteria in the lungs, lower levels of bacteremia and a better outcome following IAV-S. pneumoniae co-infection (147). type I IFN disrupts cell recruitment during pneumococcal infection. induction also restricts S. pneumoniae pathogenesis by up-regulating expression of TJ proteins (ZO-1, claudin 4, claudin 5, claudin 18, and E-cadherin) and decreasing PAFr levels in epithelial and endothelial lung cells. administration of exogenous IL-22 to mice with influenza causes upregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion. il-22BP reduces systemic dissemination of S. pneumoniae during secondary bacterial infection. line moieties bind PAFr, preventing PAF from initiating neutrophil phagocytosis and bactericidal activities. influenza still predisposes mice to S. pneumoniae infection at later times of challenge. th17 immunity promotes accelerated bacterial clearance in the URT following a secondary infection with S. pneumoniae (144) the regulation and activation of TLRs during influenza has been shown to enhance susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. increased TLR2 signaling during IAV/S. pneumoniae co-infection results in heightened production of IL-1, augmenting inflammation and morbidity. pneumococci in the airways are expelled by the mucociliary escalator. however, a recent IAV infection reduces the velocity of ciliary beating and causes death of ciliated tracheal cells. IAV regulates binding receptors for S. pneumoniae on the epithelial surface. the late phase of influenza as a repair mechanism may also promote bacterial adherence to the mucosal surface. invasive strains like TIGR4 induce the uptake by pharyngeal epithelial cells. the most profound changes to the transcriptome following pneumococcal infection coincide with clearance of colonizing bacteria in an experimental human pneumococcal carriage model. the most profound changes to the transcriptome following pneumococcal infection coincide with clearance of colonizing bacteria in an experimental human pneumococcal carriage model. early induction of type I IFN by AMs, DCs and AECs is of fundamental importance to antiviral immunity during influenza (150\u2013154) mice lacking IFNAR signaling have fewer bacteria in the lungs, lower levels of bacteremia and a better outcome following IAV-S. pneumoniae co-infection (147). this state of exhaustion lasts for several days, during which the host is particularly vulnerable to secondary infections. type I IFN disrupts cell recruitment during pneumococcal infection. IL-22 is critical to epithelial repair following infection with A/PR/8/1934. in its absence, mice sustain significantly higher lung injury and loss of airway epithelial integrity during sublethal IAV infection followed by S. pneumoniae co-infection. cocci are able to evade neutrophils by expressing a polysaccharide capsule that also physically reduces deposition of complement and antibodies. bacterial phosphorylcholine moieties bind PAFr, preventing PAF from initiating neutrophil phagocytosis and bactericidal activities. influenza still predisposes mice to S. pneumoniae infection at later times of challenge, suggesting the IAV imparts long term effects in the host. the mainstay of current influenza antiviral medications are the NA inhibitors: oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. the sialic acid cleavage activity of NA is required for release of virions from infected epithelial cells and also facilitates migration through the epithelial mucin layer. fludase is a recombinant sialidase that cleaves the sialic acid receptor for IAV on AECs preventing viral entry into cells. in phase I and II trials, Fludase was well-tolerated and led to decreased viral load and shedding. but the effects of continued fludase treatment with concurrent S. pneumoniae colonization/infection are not fully elucidated. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis contributes to continued patho corticosteroids are routinely used for their anti-inflammatory properties in chronic conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ARDS) corticosteroids have direct effects on the respiratory epithelium that may be protective. current vaccines for pneumococcal disease include 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate and 23-valent polysaccharide vaccines. targeting the microbe-host interaction could provide novel treatment strategies for pneumococcal disease. resistance, and if used in combination with direct antimicrobial medications may prove superior to monotherapy. it is also of importance to determine how these primary mechanisms relate to an individual with chronic lung disease such as asthma, COPD, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
