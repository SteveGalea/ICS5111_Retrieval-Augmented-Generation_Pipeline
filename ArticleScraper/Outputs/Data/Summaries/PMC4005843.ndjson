{"summary": "canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in dogs worldwide. no information was available regarding the incidence and prevalence of these viruses in the archipelago. canine parvovirus (CPV) was first identified in the late 1970s and was responsible for severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and myocarditis in dogs. CPV-2 was replaced by two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b and more recently a third variant was described CPV-2c. canine coronavirus (CCoV) causes mild to moderate enteritis in dogs. it is transmitted by faecal-oral route and spreads rapidly through a group of susceptible animals. stressful environments with large concentrations of animals favour the development of this disease. from the 88 sera sampling collected during 2011, 63 (71.6%) tested positive for CPV antibodies. 10 animals included in the first ELISA Unit (EU) class (100\u20131000 EU), 29 in the second EU class (1000\u201310000 EU) and 24 in the third EU class (>10000 EU) 46.6% (26/56) were positive for CPV-DNA and 64.3% (36/56) were seropositive. out of 26 dogs that were excreting the virus at the time of collection, 7 were seronegative for CPV specific IgG. study describes for the first time the shedding of three common enteric canine viruses, CPV, CDV and CCoV, in 178 stray dogs from Vila do Maio, Cape Verde. samples were collected in two consecutive years, 2010 and 2011. similar frequency of positive CPV animals was found, namely 43.3% in 2010 and 44.1% in 2011. primary IgMs were not investigated by the ELISA kit used in this study. the seroprevalence for CPV was significantly higher in older animals (p 0.05), most likely reflecting a high likelihood of virus exposure over time. a linear increase in seroprevalence with age was found. the presence of anti-CDV antibodies was not associated with gender. all CDV seropositive animals (51.1%) showed a protective antibody titer. dogs recovered from a CCoV infection may function as asymptomatic reservoirs and shed the virus periodically, resulting in a persistent and continued circulation of CCoV in the environment. CPV, CDV and CCoV are circulating in the canine population of Vila do Maio, Cape Verde. 2011 rectal swabs were homogenized in 300 l of PBS. blood samples were centrifuged at 10000xg/10 min. plasma was stored at 20\u00b0C until processing. primers were chosen within the nucleocapsid gene (AN JN896987.1) CCoV primers targeted the highly conserved 7b gene (AN JQ404410.1) a final concentration of 900 nM for the forward primer, 900 nM of reverse primer and 250 nM of each TaqMan\u00ae probe was used. amplification was performed in the StepOne Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) the cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C. the amplification cycle included a reverse transcription step at 48\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C. detection was only performed for 2011 serum samples for CPV and CDV using an indirect ELISA kit (Ingezim Canine Parvo 15.CPV.K1\u00ae and Ingezim Moquillo 1.5.CDG.K.1\u00ae-Ingenasa) the method allowed the quantification of the Ab titer for CPV, using a formula provided by the kit. 125 Sample processing Rectal swabs were homogenized in 300 l of PBS. plasma was stored at 20\u00b0C until processing. 200 l of supernatant from each rectal swab were processed. CCoV primers targeted the highly conserved 7b gene (AN JQ404410.1) as already described by [33]. a final concentration of 900 nM for the forward primer, 900 nM of reverse primer and 250 nM of each TaqMan\u00ae probe was used. a 287 bp fragment was amplified from CDV RNA (Caniffa\u00ae, Merial) a similar approach was used for CCoV sequencing. no cross reactivity was detected between CDV/CCoV/CPV. the values were organized in three classes: 100\u20131000 ELISA Units (EU); 3) 1000\u201310000 EU. for CDV the OD values had correspondence with the indirect immunofluorescence method. authors declare that they have no competing interests. io de Virologia and Professora Doutora Isabel Neto from FMV/UL."}
