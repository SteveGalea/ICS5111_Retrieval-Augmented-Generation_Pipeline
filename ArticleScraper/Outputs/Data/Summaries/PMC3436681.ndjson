{"summary": "40 NRCs for different pathogens or groups of pathogens have been installed in Belgium. a coded list of medical services including these clinical microbiological analyses is available. some activities performed by reference laboratories are not included in this coded list. the emergence of new strains, pathogens, resistance profiles and the development of new treatments necessitate a constant monitoring of their evolution [2]. the emergence of new strains, pathogens, resistance profiles and the development of new treatments necessitate a constant monitoring of their evolution. the selected NRCs work in close collaboration with other partners to collect appropriate data, samples and reference materials. the financial and legal support are provided by the national RIZIV/INAMI. the MTAB developed the list of pathogens necessitating a NRC. the coordinating center of the project is located at the national Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP) and has two missions: the administrative coordination of the project and a scientific support for public health related aspects. partners/stakeholders of the project The royal decree for establishing reference centers for human microbiology became available on 9 February 2011. the MTAB developed the list of pathogens necessitating a NRC. the list was reviewed annually based on predefined criteria and in function of the epidemiological and diagnostic needs. the MTAB finally advised on the selection of the candidates based on the evaluation by the scientific experts. this domain includes the pathogens linked to vaccine-preventable diseases, diseases/pathogens requiring direct public health action by the health inspection (e.g. chemoprohylaxis) the last domain includes pathogens for which it is important that the diagnosis or confirmation takes place in one center where all necessary expertise is concentrated. ynebacterium diphteriae 11 Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia, Anaplasma (Ehrlichia) 12 Enterococci 13 Enteroviruses including polioviruses and parechoviruses 14 ESBL + Carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae 15 Haemophilus influenzae 16 Hantavirus 17 Helicobacter pylori 18 Hepatitis B, C five groups of pathogens were defined, grouping different pathogens causing similar symptoms or having similar infection routes. five other groups (e.g. antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas and Acetinobacter, Coxiella brunetii, ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, measles virus and rubella virus, and mycosis) were defined based on the biological similarities of the concerning pathogens. the application files were evaluated by 3 independent experts. at least one expert in epidemiology or public health and at least two foreign experts gave individual scores on the individual topics described in the application phase. the MTAB formulated its advice on the designation of the reference centers. some pathogens belonged to more than one domain. the MTAB prioritized and selected four (40) pathogens based on an importance factor varying from moderate to high according to following criteria. ella 23 Mycobacterium spp. 24 Mycosis 25 Neisseria meningitidis 26 Noroviruses 27 Rabies virus 28 Respiratory pathogens: adenovirus, coronavirus including SARS, human parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) pathogens were selected for a single species or for multiple species belonging to the same species group. the MTAB formulated its advice on the designation of the reference centers, based on the biological similarities of the concerning pathogens. the activities of the NRCs are of interest for the individual patient by improving the patient therapy choice, the confirmation of a screening diagnosis, or the typing of the germ allowing a specific therapy. a precise and quick diagnosis makes it possible to avoid or reduce inappropriate or expensive treatments, and to reduce the period of incapacity. the national coordinated centers are an added value by bringing all expertise together. this expertise in specific pathogens will be shared with the relevant stakeholders. this can include technical advice on methods and procedures, and scientific support for and advice on the interpretation and relevance of laboratory findings. the NRCs will therefore participate in EU working groups to obtain agreements on collaborations for cross-section and cross-border activities. sharing expertise, additional technical and scientific advice, support and training in methodology with other member states will strengthen the local capability [11] determination of selection criteria for samples Minimum testing requirements for informative laboratory-based surveillance will be further elaborated. evidence-based technical guidance on appropriate sampling and microbiological testing for diagnosis of infection and further characterization of human pathogens. resistance to antimicrobials makes it possible to use effective antibiotics, antifungals or antivirals in disease treatment or prevention. the implementation of the NRC will also have an impact on the public health for numerous reasons. they will alert the medical authorities in time in the event of abnormal phenomena, such as the appearance of emerging or rare diseases. centers are an added value by bringing all expertise together. this expertise in specific pathogens will be shared with relevant stakeholders. this can include technical advice on methods and procedures, scientific support for and advice on the interpretation and relevance of laboratory findings to relevant public health authorities or routine laboratories. the NRCs could help in establishing protocols, model agreements and standard operating procedures (SOP\u2019s) at the EU level. a harmonization for typing methods to achieve comparable results will be recommended to the NRCs. the NRC should be prepared in case an emerging disease occurs in terms of infrastructure, strain identification and typing, cross-sector work, specialist capabilities, and the choice of response (international, national, regional) the launch of the NRCs promotes the public health microbiology domain as an essential tool to prevent and control infectious diseases in Belgium. referees rewrote
