{"summary": "PBD-2 is an antimicrobial cysteine-rich cationic peptide with multi-functions. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants. survival rate was recorded for 10 days. proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection. the application of PBD-2 can be further investigated."}
