{"summary": "the family Astroviridae contains two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus. astroviruses are important causes of diarrheal and occasionally extraintestinal disease in various animals, including humans (1\u20134). no complete genome sequence of a FAstV is available. the genome of FAstV2 strain 1637F is 6,779 nucleotides (nt) in length after excluding the polyadenylated tract. the G+C content is 50 mol%. the genome organization is similar to those of other astrovirus genomes. HAstVs have descended from a common ancestral animal astrovirus. the complete genome sequence of FAstV2 1637F has been submitted to GenBank under the accession number."}
