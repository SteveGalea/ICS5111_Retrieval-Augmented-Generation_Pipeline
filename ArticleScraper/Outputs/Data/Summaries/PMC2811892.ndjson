{"summary": "human host immune response following infection with nvH1N1 is poorly understood. we profiled 29 cytokines and chemokines and evaluated the haemagglutination inhibition activity as quantitative and qualitative measurements of host immune responses in both hospitalized and mild patients. the emergence of the new pandemic variant of influenza virus (nvH1N1) has brought renewed attention to the strategies for prevention, treatment and minimization of the social and human costs of the influenza disease. the great majority of nvH1N1 infections are mild and self-limiting in nature [6-8]. hypercytokinemia of specific chemokines and cytokines is associated with severe and often fatal cases of human H5N1 infections. de Jong et al. have demonstrated that hypercytokinemia of specific chemokines and cytokines is associated with severe and often fatal cases of human H5N1 infections. bacterial infection defined by the presence of purulent respiratory secretions, and/or positive results in respiratory cultures, blood cultures, and/or positive urinary antigen test to Legionella pneumophila or Streptococcus pneumoniae were excluded from the analysis. pregnant women were also excluded to avoid confusion factors during the analysis of the immune response to the virus. nvH1N1 neuraminidase gene was amplified by QRT-PCR in each serum sample. nvH1N1 neuraminidase gene was amplified by QRT-PCR in each serum sample. interferon, adiponectin and leptin were measured by using an enzyme-linked inmuno adsorbant assay (ELISA) HI assays were performed on a 100 l aliquot of the samples at university health network (UHN), Toronto, Ontario, Canada. patients with respiratory insufficiency, hospitalized non critical patients with respiratory insufficiency, and mild outpatients with no respiratory insufficiency were asked to donate a serum sample for the study. the final number of patients used for analysis was based on exclusion and matching criteria listed in Figure 1. nasopharyngeal swabs preserved in virus transportation medium were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) associated National Influenza Centers of Valladolid, Majadahonda and Barcelona, Spain for viral diagnosis purposes. RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained by using automatic extractors (Biomerieux\u00ae), Roche\u00ae (Basel, Switzerland) and viral presence was assessed by real time PCR based methods. '-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3' (forward); 5'-TTCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT-3' (reverse) and 5'-CACGGTCGCATG-3' (reverse) Cytokines and chemokines quantification Serum chemokine and cytokine levels were evaluated using the multiplex Biorad 27 plex assay (Hercules, CA, USA) HI assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates with 0.5% turkey erythrocytes, as previously described [21] using inactivated pandemic influenza A/California/07/2009 (nvH1N1) antigens. a single serum sample was obtained from each patient or control. nvH1N1 neuraminidase gene was amplified by QRT-PCR in each serum sample. crossing points were extrapolated to the external curve. results were given as relative comparisons in (pg RNA/l) assays were performed on a 100 l aliquot of the samples at university health network (UHN), Toronto, Ontario, Canada. the sera was treated by diluting one part serum with three parts enzyme and were incubated overnight in a 37\u00b0C water bath. the enzyme was inactivated by a 30-minute incubation at 56\u00b0C. ten patients required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to their respiratory situation. the remaining 10 were admitted to other specialized hospital services. outpatients had no difficulties with respiratory function, showing respiratory rates under 25' clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients Hospitalized, critical illness(n = 10) Hospitalized, non critical illness (n = 10) Pathological antecedents Esquizophrenia 1/10 - COPD 1/10 - Diabetes 2/10 - Asthma - 2/10 COPD+HIV - 1/10 Chronic disease conective tissue - 1/10 Dyslipemia 1/10 - Cardiopathy 1/10 - Hypertension 1/10 - Obesity (BMI>30) 5 HI activity (A/California/07/2009) was present in serum from only two critically ill patients of 50 and 51 years old (titres 1/1280 and 1/160 respectively) and in one 25-year-old outpatient (titre 1/160) this data supports the notion that at the time of sampling the vast majority of the patients had yet to produce antibodies against. nvH1N1 induced a systemic elevation of three chemokines that have been shown to be expressed early during viral infections. IL-8, IFN-, IL-13, IL-10 levels were higher in the hospitalized patients than in outpatients and controls. only severe non critical patients showed significant higher levels of IL-17 and TNF- than mild. a significant inverse association was found between IL-6 and PaO2 in hospitalized patients. in the non critically ill hospitalized patients group, a negative association was observed between IL-15 and PaO2 [-0.7; 0.039]. fifty-three percent of the outpatients were male and 47% female (n = 8 and 7 respectively) average age was as follows: hospitalized patients (36.6; 11.5), outpatients (29.7; 8.0) and healthy controls (29.5; 13.2). Critical patients were slightly older than the other hospitalized patients. tissue - 1/10 Dyslipemia 1/10 - Cardiopathy 1/10 - Hypertension 1/10 - Obesity (BMI>30) 5/10 3/10 Descriptives Age (yrs) 41.8 (9.9) 31.3 (10.9) Sex (M/F) 6/4 6/4 Days at hospital 29.5 (29.2) 6.5 (2.8) Days at ICU 26.6 (30.8) 0 (0) Severity scores SOFA score 5.6 (2.9) - APACHE aline 5/10 0/10 Renal replacement therapy 2/10 0/10 COPD = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; HIV = Human Immunodeficiency Virus; BMI = Body Mass Index; ICU = Intensive Care Unit; SOFA = Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score. HI activity (A/California/07/2009) was present in serum from only two critically ill patients. IL-13, IL-10 levels were higher in the hospitalized patients than in outpatients and controls (P 0.05). only severe non critical patients showed significant higher levels of IL-17 and TNF- than mild. IL-15 and IL-12p70 increased exclusively in critical patients. the early expression of these chemokines in all patients likely is indicative of innate antiviral host responses. the early expression of these chemokines in all patients likely is indicative of innate antiviral host responses. IL-10 is a Th2 cytokine that induces differentiation of Th-17 cells. IL-13 attenuates Th-17 cytokine production [31]. IL-10 is known to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine. increased IL-17 and TNF- in hospitalized patients over control indicated they parallel severe disease. the ability of influenza A virus to induce the production of chemotactic (RANTES, MIP-1, MCP-1, MCP-3, and IP-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-) Th1 related mediators is well known from previous reports on seasonal influenza [29,35] this is the first report evidencing Th17 response as a signature of severe influenza disease in humans [36,37] early response to the virus in both hospitalized and outpatients was characterized by expression of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL4) patients who develop respiratory compromise typically showed Th1 and Th17 hyper-cytokinemia. increased systemic levels of IL-15, IL-12p70, IL-6 constituted a hallmark of critical illness. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions TP, JR and IML assisted in the design of the study, coordinated patient recruitment, analysed and interpreted the data, and assisted in writing the paper.
