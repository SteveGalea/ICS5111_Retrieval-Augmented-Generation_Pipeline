{"summary": "there will be a need by public health authorities to characterize the extent of the hazard in order to minimize the number of casualties. a single-hit model assumes that individuals are homogeneous, but the in-host biological mechanisms are stochastic, and not deterministic processes. exponential dose\u2013response relation can be recast as the exponential distribution function, 1.1 with = log(1 phit) a crucial difference between independent action and individual effective dose is in the way in which the bacteria are perceived to interact. a mechanistic interpretation of the exponential dose\u2013response relation has been considered for anthrax. Brookmeyer et al. model the inhalation of (toxin-producing) Bacillus anthacis spores in humans under the assumption that the hit required to provoke illness constitutes a spore germinating before being cleared from the lung. the birth, death and survival rates are > 0 and > 0 respectively. the threshold for illness is MN. deterministic solution of the birth\u2013death process for time until response is obtained by solving dB/dt = B with B(0) = k. the birth\u2013death process may be an appropriate model for bacteria that replicate extracellularly. but it is not suitable for intracellular bacteria that reproduce within cells. the model is applied to F. tularensis as a potential weapon of bioterrorism. the most severe form of the disease is pneumonic (or respiratory) tularaemia. it is caused by inhalation of aerosolized particles [19] of the highly virulent tularensis subspecies [17,21]. this intracellular organism is considered facultative in vitro, but is thought to be obligate in vivo. a deterministic solution of this process is obtained by solving dB/dt = GP( + )B and dP/dt = BP with B(0) = k and P(0) = 0 which yields 2.1 and 2.2 where and = + + + r. the second exponential term in equation (2.1) is always decaying. host heterogeneity can be conveniently incorporated by sampling threshold M from an appropriate distribution at each run of the simulation. in vivo studies, it is claimed neither component of variability is sufficient to explain experimental results. a lognormal distribution function (with log-mean 3.72 and log-standard deviation 0.385) is found to provide the best approximation to these data. a median time of 41.5 h is found (2.5% of cells are unhealthy by 19.5 h and 97.5% unhealthy by 88.2 h) a logistic function is fitted to the data in order to capture the natural exponential growth of bacteria coupled with the stagnating effect of depleting nutrients. formula (2.5) (with t 1) is fitted by nonlinear least squares yielding C = 384 and = 0.212. the number of bacteria released upon cell death (at time 1) is calculated through equation (2.5) as G = g(1)358 (dotted line) in both experiments, extensive morbidity (and mortality) is observed at 3 days. a short incubation period is associated with high challenge doses in monkeys exposed to type A F. tularensis [40]. the model The following birth\u2013death\u2013survival process is assumed for a particular threshold, MN. the host inhales a quantity of organisms all of which are transported to the extracellular space within the lung. a phagocyte dies, releasing its contents into the lung-space. a deterministic solution of this process is obtained by solving dB/dt = GP( + )B and dP/dt = BP with B(0) = k and P(0) = 0 which yields 2.1 and 2.2 where and = + + + r. a numerical solution is considered by means of discrete-event simulation. in vitro study, human macrophages are infected with Schu S4. at 16 h there is no evidence of cytopathogenicity and at 24 and 32 h, 8% and 25% of infected cells are unhealthy. a lognormal distribution function (with log-mean 3.72 and log-standard deviation 0.385) is found to provide the best approximation to these data (by log-likelihood value) with this distribution, a median time of 41.5 h (figure 3a) is found (2.5% of cells are unhealthy by 19.5 h. formula (2.5) is fitted to the data (figure 3b) by nonlinear least squares yielding C = 384 and = 0.212. exponential growth occurs between ts = 1 h and te = 24 h. using equation (2.6), the intracellular doubling time is found to be 3.50 h. a short incubation period is associated with high challenge doses in monkeys exposed to type A F. tularensis. the result at 72 h is excluded for both studies. the model is fitted to the remaining data by nonlinear least squares. in vitro study, human macrophages are infected with Schu S4. at 16 h there is no evidence of cytopathogenicity. at 24 and 32 h, 8% and 25% of infected cells are unhealthy. deterministic solution for bacteria over time fitted to in vivo data of [30,31], (d) number of extracellular bacteria present at illness onset, lognormal distribution fitted to estimations based on [32,33] using equation (2.1) the intracellular doubling time is found to be 3.50 h. deterministic birth\u2013death\u2013survival model (equation) is fitted to in vivo data for infection with Schu S4 [30,31]. in both experiments, monkeys are exposed to a high initial aerosol dose (600 000 and 3 000 000, respectively) and are sacrificed at predetermined times of up to 72 h. in the parametrization of the model is the determination of an appropriate distribution for the number of extracellular bacteria within the lung-space required for illness. the results are produced using the discrete-event simulation approach outlined in Material and methods. the results are produced using the discrete-event simulation approach outlined in Material and methods. dose\u2013response relation of the stochastic solution of the model (blue line) and others obtained in the literature are also plotted. the solution is well approximated by an exponential distribution. this indicates that the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model for F. tularensis may be interpreted as a single-hit-type model. to explore this further, consider the time immediately after exposure. ensis can be interpreted as a single-hit-type model whereby a \u2018hit\u2019 is defined as the failed phagocytosis of a single bacterium. if the threshold is fixed, say at the median Mmed = 2.4 1011, then an equivalent dose\u2013response relation is produced (because the probability of resolution is negligible for just 358 extracellular bacteria). light grey boxes represent a range for studies in which an explicit result is not provided. results for the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model with a fixed threshold (set at the median, Mmed = 2.41011) have also been deduced. the 95% quantiles (plotted) indicate a significant difference in dispersion, particularly at doses larger than 100 organisms. relationship between skewness and kurtosis is plotted for comparison. skewness (squared) and kurtosis is compared between these distributions and the model results. the potential significance of these comparisons is considered in more detail. the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model for F. tularensis can be interpreted as a single-hit-type model. to explore this further, consider the time immediately after exposure. there are no bacteria-containing phagocytes and two events can occur: death (killing of bacteria), with probability pd = /( + ) = 0.97, or survival (phagocytosis of bacteria not resulting in bacterial death), with probability ps = / the median number of bacteria-containing phagocytes at the time of illness for the simulation results is assessed and found to be within an order of magnitude of the deterministic solution (equation (2.3) into equation (2.2) at all doses. also included is the log-linear relation (equation (1.3) obtained by fitting specifically to the data of [32,33] the distribution of incubation period (for the model with a distributed threshold) varies significantly with dose. it would appear that the values of these measures follow a trend for doses fewer than 100 (decreasing mean, standard deviation; increasing skewness, kurtosis), between 100 and 300 (all measures decreasing), and greater than 300 (decreasing mean; other measures constant) the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model has provided a useful foundation for the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model considered here. in the 1960s, there was considerable academic interest in the mathematics of the simple birth\u2013death model, involving stochastic differential equations [14,15] and generating functions [48] but very few experimental studies have actually made use of these results. a simple in-cell mechanistic model suggests that the variance is being overestimated by the exponential distribution. the model fails to account for variability in other sources that can affect dispersion, such as bacterial age [42], diameter [7,51], agglutination, number retained and deposition site [23]. literature for F. tularensis, no information could be found regarding the number of bacteria that can be simultaneously phagocytosed by any one cell in vivo. it is assumed that there is an unlimited supply of phagocytes. this assumption is made, because the mechanisms that govern the number of viable phagocytes within the lung-space are complex and potentially unknown. the intracellular doubling time (in humans) is less than with attenuated strains. the death and survival rates are estimated by fitting the deterministic solution to the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model for extracellular bacteria over time (equation (2.1) to data from two in vivo studies (in which monkeys are exposed to aerosolized Schu S4). deterministic solution for extracellular bacteria over time (equation) is fitted to data from two in vivo studies. this data clearly suggest an initial drop in the number of extracellular bacteria followed by exponential growth. a birth\u2013death model cannot represent these characteristics, but an accurate portrayal is obtained by extend this standard approach to incorporate phagocytosis. if the threshold is lognormally distributed then, the times at which the number of extracellular bacteria reach this threshold are normally distributed. this increased dispersion enables the model to capture the variability exhibited in the data for such doses. however, at lower doses, the majority of the variability is attributable to the stochastic in-host processes, so the characterization of the threshold itself plays a lesser role. tularensis raises some interesting parallels to some of the classical dose\u2013response models. first, the infection dynamics for dose\u2013response can be simplified to the single-hit model, whereby the hit required for response is a failed phagocytosis. second, the thresholds are found to be lognormally distributed, as in the probit model. the underlying Markov structure of the model restricts the choice of statistical distribution in representing the occurrence of the three events. the simplest choice is the exponential distribution (in which events occur at random) because of the memoryless property of this distribution, the length of time from bacterial uptake until phagocytic death is unknown. but by removing this legitimate source of variability, this falsely increases the certainty of any model results. it is assumed that the length of time from exposure until response is insufficient for any discernible effect of the adaptive response to become apparent. however, if the adaptive response does come into effect before the time of illness, then this would reduce the growth rate of extracellular bacteria. discrete-event simulation approach used in this study could be modified with ease. the number of bacteria released is estimated by determining the amount of intracellular bacterial growth that begins from phagocytosis until cell death. the number of bacteria released is estimated by determining the amount of intracellular bacterial growth that begins from phagocytosis until cell death. the validity of the intracellular doubling time can be assessed. the threshold for illness is lower (10 times according to [24], owing to monkey body weight being one-tenth that of a human) this supports shorter incubation periods for monkeys (48\u201372 h) when compared with humans, and as a result only data up to 48 h are used in this study. birth\u2013death deterministic solution only yields the net growth rate. it is assumed that clinical infection occurs when some threshold number of bacteria is in the system. the triggering of symptoms is a very complex process with few data available to validate more detailed models. standard two-parameter distributions are unable to represent the skewness and kurtosis of the modelled incubation period distributions. the only distribution, out of those considered, that is able to do so is the (four parameter) Johnson SU family of distributions."}
