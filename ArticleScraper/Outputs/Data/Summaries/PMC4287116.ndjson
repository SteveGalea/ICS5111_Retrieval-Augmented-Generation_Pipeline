{"summary": "introduction Lassa fever (LF), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by Lassa virus (LASV), was first identified in Nigeria in 1969 (9,14,45) and subsequently identified in Sierra Leone in 1973 during an outbreak in the town of Panguma, located in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone (29). the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), a 350-bed hospital located in the heart of the LF endemic zone of Sierra Leone, the LF program at the KGH provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year (41) since 2008, there have been continuous improvements in LF laboratory testing at the KGH. this includes developing and refining recombinant antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of LASV antigens (viremia) and for LASV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) a total case count of 6,599 has been reported in Sierra Leone. a total case count of 6,599 has been confirmed, 79 probable, and 1,079 suspected cases of EVD. a total case count in Guinea, liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain, and the united states now stands at 15,935, with 5,689 deaths. genetic analyses of strains that have emerged in west africa suggest that EBOV has been in Guin\u00e9e Foresti\u00e8re for several decades. serum samples were tested from NLFI patients for the presence of non-Lassa febrile agents, including arboviruses and filoviruses. evidence is reported for possible human exposure to EBOV in Sierra Leone prior to the current 2014 EVD outbreak. clinical study Suspected LF patients were enrolled in this clinical study after a pre-admission evaluation. the suspected LF case definition was a reported or documented temperature 38\u00b0C for 3 weeks with absence of local inflammation and at least two major, or one major plus two minor, or at least three minor signs and symptoms of classic LF infection. LF (Lassa fever) defined as PCR\u2013IgM+(or Ag\u2013IgM+when PCR data were unavailable) b LPE (LASV prior-exposure) defined as PCR\u2013IgM+(or Ag\u2013IgM+when PCR data were unavailable. d p-Value for Fisher's exact test for testing for association among the three comparison groups. insufficient data for calculating Fisher's exact test statistic. NLFI patient sera (fever of unknown origin; FUOs) were selected for testing based on apparent morbidity. patients with moderate to high symptom frequencies were selected in part. 77 sera were analyzed in non-LF tropical disease ELISA kits. PCR analysis was performed on 41 of the original panel of 77 sera due to lack of sample volume from the remaining 36 sera. infectious agent or family-specific oligonucleotides and minigene amplicons were identified in the published literature. each method was validated with agent-specific in vitro generated RNA transcripts. RNA transcripts were generated by runoff in vitro transcription reactions. PCR protocols were validated with target RNAs or DNAs spiked in normal human serum at 1 g/mL. negative controls specifically designed to test for contamination of extraction and purification reagents, PCR buffers, oligonucleotides, and polymerase stocks. reLASV\u00ae IgG/IgM ELISA Kit includes a normal human serum control. retrospective study was performed with banked sera samples collected between 2011 and 2014 (n=242) using a ReEBOVTM IgM/IgG ELISA platform recently developed by the VHFC. the testing protocol was similar to the ReLASV\u00ae IgG/IgG ELISA described above. human subjects Suspected LF cases and close contacts of confirmed cases were eligible for enrollment in this study. only KGH staff involved in administration of healthcare to patients at the KGH Lassa Ward. suspected LF patients were enrolled in this clinical study after a pre-admission evaluation to determine if they presented with sufficient signs of febrile illness. the suspected LF case definition was a reported or documented temperature 38\u00b0C for 3 weeks with absence of local inflammation and at least two major, or one major plus two minor, or at least three minor signs and symptoms of classic LF infection. 8/23 (35) 6/24 (25) 22/72 (31) 0.81 Sore throat 6/25 (24) 9/23 (39) 9/24 (38) 24/72 (33) 0.47 Abdominal pain 7/25 (28) 8/23 (35) 12/24 (50) 27/72 (38) 0.72 Jaundice 0/25 (0) 0/23 (0) 1/24 (4) 1/72 (1) 0.65 Shortness of breath 1/25 (4) 0/23 (0) 1/24 (4) 2/ patient serum was collected and aliquoted to perform the ReLASV\u00ae Ag ELISA and ReLASV\u00ae IgM/IgG ELISAs. the rapid test is designed to accept either whole blood from a finger stick, plasma, or serum. patients with moderate to high symptom frequencies were selected in part based on the volume of the available sample to perform the numerous assays. 77 sera were analyzed in non-LF tropical disease ELISA kits. infectious agent or family-specific oligonucleotides and corresponding minigene amplicons were identified in the published literature (16,17,20,28,36\u201339,42) nucleic acids were isolated from 100 L of patient serum using either a Qiagen QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit or a Genomic DNA Isolation kit. PCR protocols were validated with target RNAs or DNAs spiked in normal human serum at 1 g/mL. unrestricted, diluted plasmid solutions were used directly in PCR reactions. PCR protocols were validated with target RNAs or DNAs spiked in normal human serum at 1 g/mL, extracted with the kits indicated above. gM ELISA Test kits utilize microwell plates coated with LASV nucleoprotein. the kit includes a normal human serum control. reference serum, controls, and patient serum were diluted 1:100 in sample buffer. the prototype used microwell plates coated with recombinant filovirus antigens. the testing protocol was similar to the ReLASV\u00ae IgG/IgG ELISA described above. a positive cutoff was established on the 80th percentile obtained. clinical symptoms or blood chemistries cannot distinguish LF patients from patients with NLFIs. malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever, leptospirosis, meningococcemia, bacterial sepsis can all be confused with VHF in the early stages of disease presentation. subjects with neither LASV antigenemia nor anti-LASV IgM were considered to have a NLFI. the LF group had a higher mortality at 45% (p=0.04) than either the subjects with LPE or NLFI. the lower CFR in the current study is likely due in part to the lack of sufficient serum volume for the study. clinical chemistry LF (n=29)a LPE (n=24)b NLFI (n=24)c Total (n=77) p-Valued Sodium 137 (6) 131 (11) 133 (9) 133 (26) 0.91 Potassium 5 (6) 5 (10) 6 (9) 5 (25) 0.78 tCO2 22 (6) 16 (11) 18 (9) 18 (26) 0.44 Cl 92 (7) 98 (11) 95 (9) 95 (27) 0.31 c NLFI defined as PCR\u2013IgM\u2013 (or Ag\u2013IgM\u2013 when PCR data were unavailable) c NLFI defined as PCR\u2013IgM\u2013 (or Ag\u2013IgM\u2013 when PCR data were unavailable) d p-Value for Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for comparing mean values among the three comparison groups. n=9)c p-Valued IFN-gamma 871.16 (0.00, 2007.24) 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) 0.0005* Fatal 1181.59 (625.21, 2547.12) 0.00 (0.00, 1763.33) 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) 0.0454* Nonfatal 0.00 (0.00, 1036.89) 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) 0.00 (0.00, 0.00 a LF defined as PCR+(or Ag\u2013IgM+when PCR data were unavailable) a NLFI defined as PCR\u2013IgM+ (or Ag\u2013IgM+when PCR data were unavailable) a single patient sample was positive for a 419 nt amplicon corresponding to a conserved filoviral L gene segment (1/41, 2.0%); three double positives for P. falciparum and WNV (3/41, 7%). one double positive for P. falciparum and LASV (1/41, 2%), and one triple positive for LASV, WNV, and P. falciparum (1/49, 2%; table 4 and Fig. 1). the study did not identify P. vivax positive malaria (0/41, 0%), although at least one patient has been identified.

LF patients had elevated levels of AST and ALT, enzymes found in the liver, cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells. previous studies have found AST and ALT to be significantly elevated in subjects with acute LF compared to other LPE or NLFI groups. this marker has limited diagnostic or prognostic value. glucose 5 (7) 3 (12) 4 (9) 4 (28) 0.37 Calcium 2 (7) 2 (11) 2 (8) 2 (26) 0.50 BUN 8 (7) 9 (12) 6 (9) 8 (28) 0.58 CRE 71 (6) 132 (12) 100 (9) 107 (27) 0.59 ALP 82 (7) 243 (12) 147 (9) 172 (28) 106 (28) 0.67 AST 402 (7) 156 (10) 79 (9) 195 (26) 0.74 cytokines and chemokines are altered during LASV infection or exposure in both humans and nonhuman primates. cytokines showed different levels in acute LF, LPE, and NLFI.

LASV IgG seropositive rates were higher for LPE and NLFI (50% and 46% respectively) compared to LF (24%), suggesting these patients had prior exposure to LASV. acute LF patients also showed positive IgM and IgG responses to DENV. only three sera from the data set reported in Figures 2 and 3 were also analyzed in the retrospective EBOV IgG study. serum from the sample that tested positive in the filovirus-specific PCR in January 2012 was not available for testing in the EBOV IgG/IgM ELISA. a subset of samples collected in early 2014, prior to the identification of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone, was further characterized for IgM and IgG reactivity to EBOV VP40 and GP antigens independently. some patients registered significant IgM reactivity against both antigens (G-3625), without corresponding measurable IgG titers. distribution of OD 450 nm values in EBOV IgG combo ELISA with the EBOV GP-specific KZ52 control monoclonal antibody over a titration range (blue bars) the cutoff OD 450 nm=0.360 results in a 20% positive rate for samples registering IgG antibodies specific to EBOV proteins (GP and VP40) studies did not identify an obvious correlation between seasons and the emergence of seroreactivity against EBOV antigens. the patients were generally severely ill, regardless of whether they were diagnosed with LF. drug-resistant strains of malaria parasites have been circulating in west africa. more studies are needed to determine whether the parasite burdens detected by PCR may be sufficient to induce VHF-like signs and symptoms that precipitated the subjects to seek medical attention. a serological study was performed of the exposure to flaviviruses or arboviruses in the febrile illness subjects presenting to the KGH. a high level of exposures was detected in these cohorts to DENV, WNV, CHIKV, leptospirosis, and typhus. the prevalence of EBOV-specific IgG was 15.3% overall, increasing to 32.4% (p0.001) in forest areas (6). no sociodemographic risk factors were found, but the antibody prevalence increased linearly up to 20 years of age. the results of the current studies support the possibility that filovirus infections occurred in Sierra Leone prior to the 2014 outbreak. an individual with EVD presenting to a health facility in this region would have a high likelihood of being diagnosed with another disease, such as malaria, on clinical grounds alone. EBOV-specific IgG-capture assays appear to be sensitive, specific, and robust. but more work will be needed to validate the assays fully with derivation of commercially acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity. the development of a multiplexed LFI with the ability to differentiate between LASV and the filoviruses is under way. a potential index case for the current EVD outbreak may have been identified in Guinea (1). anecdotal reports of an exceptionally dry and prolonged dry season may have had an impact in triggering the transmission of EBOV from its natural host to humans."}
