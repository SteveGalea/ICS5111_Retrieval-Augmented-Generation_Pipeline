{"summary": "\"fragile\" is an epithet often associated with living organisms, perceived as delicate and easily damaged. but does this reflect reality\" \"tinkering outperforms design\" a wealth of studies compared economics and biology [4-6]. in many of its features, life indeed appears to share this property with the Hydra. challenged, it responds by creating new forms of life. in the succession of generations, antifragile life tends to expand its exploration of the world. living systems are antifragile in that they can do much more than simply respond to the \u201cpressure\u201d of the environment by random mutations followed by selection. they have an in-built property that allows them to find solutions in the face of adversity. the present reflection is organized in three parts. the longest time spent by most organisms during their lifetime does not involve reproduction. if reproduction were allowed to proceed unchecked, the Earth would have been covered by one species that would have subsequently been halted in its tracks by exhaustion of nutrient supplies. the cell Senses Its Physical State and Exchanges Atoms and Molecules. the cell's chassis combines management of compartmentalisation and metabolism. the cell must get a large variety of chemicals from the environment. the cell must get a large variety of chemicals from the environment. redundancy in the function of transporters, either pre-existing or resulting from the process of ageing, will limit the number needed to be conserved in the long term. there is no heavy-duty requirement for these functions that may slowly deteriorate over time without dramatic consequences. a puzzling observation stems from the composition of the degradosome. many of its functions are carried out by proteins that are significantly longer than average bacterial proteins (300 residues) this is counter-intuitive because the synthesis of long proteins is expected to be fragile. many energy-dependent proteases have been characterized, including Clp, Lon, and FtsH (HflB) in coli. many energy-dependent proteases have been characterized, including Clp, Lon, and FtsH (HflB) in e. coli. acyldepsipeptide-activated ClpP core initiates proteolytic degradation without the control exerted by Clp-ATPases. this unchecked activity, which shows that the energy of ATP is not used in the very process of protein hydrolysis, leads to the inhibition of bacterial cell division and eventually cell death. tyl-Coenzyme A must be present for proper functioning of the cell. the murein sacculus (the rigid peptidoglycan structure that gives the cell its shape and protects it against deleterious changes in the environment) is likely to be quite stable and will not require heavy-duty maintenance. tRNA synthetases 1 amidotransferase EFTu EFTs EFG folding chaperones Tig Ppi DnaJKGrpEGroSL Tig DnaJKGrpE GroSL metabolism carbon Eno PykA Pps AceEF Lip Ppa...
