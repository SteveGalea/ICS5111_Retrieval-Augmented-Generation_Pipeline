{"summary": "many isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus have been completely sequenced [1-4]. in most cases, only synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions have been reported within the major viral genes. large insertions or deletions have been found in the part of viral genome that encode the SARS-CoV accessory proteins which have no viral homologues. the use of clinical samples for this study was approved by the Tan Tock Seng Hospital ethics committee. essentially, 15 independent clones from each of the eight SARS patient samples were sequenced. the 3a gene from culture-derived SARS-CoV isolates contained heterogeneous extensions at this internal oligo(T) tract. the nature of this extension was such that up to three additional T's were added to the 6T's tract. any change in the number of T's in this oligo(T) tract would result in a frameshift mutation and premature translation termination of 3a. 3a sequence variants within a population of SARS-CoV obtained from clinical and culture-derived samples. the value above each column represents the percentage of in-frame 3a genes within the population. translation of a frameshifted 3a gene would terminate shortly after 18 residues. cells were initially probed with anti-myc monoclonal antibodies followed by the corresponding FITC-conjugated antibody. expression levels of the myc-tagged proteins in cells used for the FACS experiment were determined by Western blot analysis. viral genomes possessing different lengths of the poly(A) tract could be recognized even from just a single PFU of FMDV [11]. it is intriguing to find that unlike 3a, the 3amut1 is not transported to the cell surface as the cell surface expression may be involved in modulating the trafficking properties of the spike protein. isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been completely sequenced [1-4] in most cases, only synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions have been reported within the major viral genes. large insertions or deletions have been found in the part of viral genome that encodes the SARS-CoV accessory proteins. the study was approved by the Tan Tock Seng Hospital ethics committee. it is possible that direct sequencing results do not show this mutation if it is present in a minority population. the 3a gene from culture-derived SARS-CoV isolates contained heterogeneous extensions at this internal oligo(T) tract. the nature of this extension was such that up to three additional T's were added to the 6T's tract. any change in the number of T's in this oligo(T) tract would result in a frameshift mutation and premature translation termination of 3a. truncated forms of 3a, named as 3amut1, can be detected in lysate of infected cells. 3amut1 corresponds to 101 to 274 amino acids of 3a and lacks first two transmembrane domains. myc-3amut1 and myc-GST were detected in transfected vero E6 cells. expression levels of the myc-tagged proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. it is possible that the aberrant nature of the oligo(T) tract in the 3a gene is akin to that of the nucleotide insertion event in the oligo(A) tract. viral genomes possessing different lengths of the poly(A) tract could be recognized even from just a single PFU of FMDV [11]. the virus in some patients appear to encode only for the truncated form(s) of 3a and not the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1). authors' contributions THPT carried out all experimental work and drafted the manuscript.
