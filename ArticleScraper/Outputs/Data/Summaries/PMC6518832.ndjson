{"summary": "human HEV infection is more prevalent in older ages [7\u201320], lower socio-economic status [21], poorer residence areas [9, 14\u201315], among sheltered homeless adults [14], specific nationalities. majority of the population in Israel comprises Jews (74.8%) and Arabs (20.8%), of which 84.7% are Muslims [26]. the Bedouins in Israel compose a unique nomadic Muslim Arab population. non-Bedouin Muslim Arabs live in villages spread around the country. many of the Bedouins who live in southern Israel own dromedary camels. the selection was enabled by the availability of basic demographic information including age, gender, place of residence (city), birth country and population group (Bedouins; non-Bedouin Arabs; Jews [28]) for each sample in this sera bank. the socio-economic status was allocated on the basis of the given address using the socio-economic residential classification published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistic. prevalence rates of anti-HEV antibodies in camels and in human sera were calculated by dividing the number of samples positive to anti-HEV antibodies by the total number of samples tested in each group. logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the factors associated with anti-HEV seropositivity. data analysis reveals 95.6% concordance between the kits. prevalence rates of anti-HEV antibodies in camels and in human sera were calculated by dividing the number of samples positive to anti-HEV antibodies by the total number of samples tested. the difference in seropositivity rates between Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs was statistically significant (P-value = 0.032) the difference in seropositivity rates between Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs was statistically significant (P-value = 0.032) 3.8 44 14.7 (10.9\u201319.2) 6\u201310 9 2.8 2 22.2 (2.8\u201360.0) Missing 11 3.4 2 18.2 (2.3\u201351.8) Jews Age group (years) 20\u201329 40 20.5 1 2.5 (0.1\u201313.2) 30\u201339 46 23.6 0 0.0 (0.0\u20137.7) 40 109 55.9 5 4.6 (1.5\u201310.4) Gender Male 109 55.9 2 1.8 (0.2\u20136.5) Female 86 44.1 4 single variable analysis showed that seropositivity was significantly higher among Arabs (Bedouins and non-Bedouin); older age groups (30\u201339 and 40 years) and lower socio-economic status (Table 3). no significant interaction was identified. sensitivity analysis performed for the classification of the equivocal samples as positive or negative, no significant difference was observed. the seroprevalence among camels 10 and above, 7 and 3 years old were 88.9% (16/18) (95%CI 65.3\u201398.6%), 56.0% (14/25) (95% CI 34.9\u201375.6%) and 67.4% (29/43) (95% CI 51.5\u201380.9%) % (95% CI) Bedouins Age group (years) 20\u201329 101 33.1 1 1.0 (0.0\u20135.4) 30\u201339 101 33.1 16 15.8 (9.3\u201324.5) 40 103 33.8 49 47.6 (37.6\u201357.7) Gender Male 155 50.8 35 22.6 (16.3\u201330.0) Female 150 49.2 31 20.7 (14.5\u201328.0) Socio-economic status 1\u20135 143 46.9 37 25.9 (18. single variable analysis of human serum samples in Israel of anti-Hepatitis E IgG positive, by population group Population group Variable Category OR 95% CI P-value Bedouins Age group (years) 20\u201329 Ref.
