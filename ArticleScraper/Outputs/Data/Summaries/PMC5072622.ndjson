{"summary": "Approximately half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of being infected. more than 125 countries are endemic to DENV, but geographical expansion is expected to increase due to climate change, globalization of travel and trade. the leading candidate, which has been tested in two large efficacy studies, demonstrated partial efficacy that varies between serotypes and based on the prior dengue exposure history of individuals [10]. Moreover, in some populations, the vaccine appeared to transiently increase risk of disease when people were exposed to a natural infection [10]. the pharmacokinetic characteristics of nanoparticles depend on the intrinsic properties of the particle itself. smaller particles are phagocytosed slower than larger particles, which contributes to better distribution by rapid dissolution. the optimization of nanoparticle composition, size and shape depends on disease target and application characteristics. in DMEM (Gibco) media supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture was maintained as a suspension culture in EXPI293 Expression Medium (Life Technologies) the fractions containing envelope protein were pooled, concentrated to 3mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80\u00b0C. the envelope protein was >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. protein analysis Purified sRecE protein fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plates were washed (TBS+0.05% Tween-20) and blocked (washing buffer + 3% skim milk) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. the blocking buffer was discarded and the plates were incubated with 100 ng/well of the indicated mouse-derived (4G2, 3H5, DV2-46, 8A1) or human-derived (1M7, DVC-10.16, 2D22) Mabs in blocking buffer for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. the size and -potential measurements were conducted on PLGA particle dispersions in 1 mM KCl solution using a 0.2 m polyether sulfone membrane (Millipore) the size and -potential measurements were conducted on PLGA particle dispersions in 1 mM KCl solution. mice were immunized subcutaneously in the flank with 5 g soluble (s)RecE (n = 4), sRecE+500 g Alum (n = 4), PBS (Vehicle n = 3) or RecE adsorbed to 500 g of PLGA/DC-chol (n = 5 per size; 80x320 nm, 80x180 nm, 55x70 nm and 200x200 nm) particles detached cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 0.05% trypsin (Gibco) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. detached cells were resuspended in PBS and transferred to a new round-bottom culture plate. cells were washed once in perm buffer and spun down. cells were then incubated with Alexa fluor 488 conjugated anti-prM Mab 2H2 for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. ml in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 U/ml penicillin and 10 g/ml streptomycin, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/ml IL-4 and 10 ng/ml granulocyte\u2014macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) BMDCs were harvested on day 6 and further purified with the soluble recombinant DENV2 envelope protein (sRecE, aa1-395) was expressed using the EXPI293 transient expression system (ThermoFisher) the soluble recombinant DENV2 envelope protein (sRecE, aa1-395) was expressed using the EXPI293 transient expression system (thermoFisher) protein analysis Purified sRecE protein fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 3% skim milk in TBS + 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hr at RT. membranes were washed 3 times with blocking buffer and treated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse. plates were washed and treated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated -human IgG (Sigma, 1:2500) or -mouse IgG (Sigma, 1:1000) in blocking buffer for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. plates were subsequently washed and developed using AP-substrate (Sigma) absorption was measured at 405 nm. sRecE adsorption to PLGA particles sRecE (theoretical PI = 6.83) was incubated with NPs at indicated ratios for 15 min at RT in 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) in water. the particles were then pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 21000 g. all groups were immunized with same antigen dose. serum samples were collected by submandibular bleeding on day 21, 28, 70, 98, 154, and 210. vero cells were seeded in a 96-well culture plate at 2.5104 cells/well. the cells were serially diluted in OptiMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS. the appropriate amount of virus is added to the diluted sera and incubated 45 min at 37\u00b0C. the neutralizing efficiency of the sera was expressed as neut50 values (the dilution where 50% of the virus was neutralized) calculated using GraphPad Prism software. BMDCs were harvested on day 6 and further purified with Opti-Prep density medium (Sigma) to remove dead cells. to test cellular uptake of antigen, RecE-Alexa Fluor 647 was mixed with PLGA particles in H2O and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. all tested DENV2 reactive Mabs (Table 1) were able to bind sRecE. the highly neutralizing, DV2 specific human Mab 2D22 binds to sRecE. b. 8A1 is a deNV3 specific Mab and was used as a negative control. a panel of well-defined mouse or human (M/H) derived Mabs were used to characterize sRecE epitopes. sRecE was adsorbed to the PLGA nanoparticles in variable sRecE/PLGA (w/w%) ratios. adsorption efficiency was determined by the amount of non-adsorbed sRecE after the spinning down the particles. deNV2 specific end point dilution titers were determined on day 28, 70, 98, 154 and 210. on day 70, the 80x320 nm, 80x180 nm and 55x70 nm PLGA+RecE particles induced significant higher DENV2 specific IgG titers. the 80x180, 55x70 and 200x200 PLGA particles decorated with sRecE induced significant higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble sRecE. the group average was in the same order of magnitude as the other particulate groups. the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the nanoparticle vaccinated animals was maintained through day 210. deNV1, DENV2, DENV3 or DENV4 was tested in a neutralization assay using Vero cells. sRecE adsorption increases bio-availability in the draining lymph nodes. upper panel comparing sRecE and 80320 nm PLGA-RecE is representative for the measure of antigen presence in the PLNs. the foot pads were analyzed at similar time points to analyze the bio-availability at the inoculation site. all tested DENV2 reactive Mabs were able to bind sRecE. the envelope domain II (EDII) binding Mabs 4G2 and DV2-46) and the envelope domain III (EDIII) binding Mabs 3H5, DVC3.7 and DVC10.16 all bound to sRecE. the highly neutralizing, DV2 specific human Mab 2D22 showed weak binding indicating that a small fraction of the protein may be present as E-protein homo-di a panel of well-defined mouse or human (M/H) derived Mabs were used to characterize sRecE epitopes. flavivirus cross reactive (F-CR), dengue cross reactive (D-CR), dengue complex (D-C), weakly, moderately or strong (W/M/S) neutralizing, E-domain I, II, III (DI, DII, DIII), fusion loop (FL), lateral ridge (LR), quatern adsorption efficiency was determined by the amount of non-adsorbed sRecE after the spinning down the particles. up to a 4% w/w ratio resulted in nearly 100% adsorption efficiency for each particle size. sRecE was adsorbed to the PLGA nanoparticles in variable sRecE/PLGA ratios. 320 nm, 80x180 nm and 55x70 nm PLGA+RecE particles induced significant higher DENV2 specific IgG titers compared to sRecE. in general, IgG titers peaked at day 98 and remained elevated through day 210. sRecE adsorbed onto PRINT nanoparticles induced durable DENV2 neutralizing antibodies that were significantly higher than the levels maintained in animals that received the soluble antigen alone. neutrating activity was expressed as the dilution where 50% of the virus was neutralized (Neut50) sRecE was fluorescently labeled and adsorbed to PLGA nanoparticles. at indicated time points, the draining popliteal lymph nodes were isolated and analyzed for total fluorescence. similar rapid initial drainage of antigen was observed for both sRecE and particle-adsorbed RecE. over 300 million people are infected with deNV of which 100 million symptomatic. 500,000 to 1 million develop severe disease resulting in 25,000 deaths. the leading candidate had lower efficacy against serotype 2 and overall poor efficacy in young children. the inclusion of adjuvants in successive studies will reveal to what extend we can augment the PLGA-carrier capabilities. previous studies have demonstrated that size and shape of the nanocarrier influence processes such as cellular uptake and transport. we did not observe a significant effect of PLGA particles size and shape on DENV E specific antibody responses. studies are also planned to test if tetravalent mixtures of PLGA-RecE can be used to induce a balanced and type-specific neutralizing responses to all 4 serotypes. sRecE was detected at the site of vaccination and in the draining lymph nodes for much longer than sRecE alone. PRINT produced PLGA nanoparticles of indicated sizes were examined by Nano zetasizer for dynamic light scattering (DLS), poly dispersity index (PDI) and Zeta potential."}
