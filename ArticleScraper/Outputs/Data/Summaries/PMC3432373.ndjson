{"summary": "systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection is a typical condition within which proinflammatory mediators released from infected cells and persistent hypercytokinemia may result in progression to multiple organ failure [2] it is known that activation of cytokine networks increases levels of various cytokines in blood. the EV71 BE was stratified into three important critical stages by disease severity. ANS dysregulation is defined by the presence of cold sweating, mottled skin, tachycardia, tachypnea, rales, and frothy sputum. PE is defined as respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, rales, and frothy sputum. pathogenesis of Complicated EV71 Brain Stem Encephalitis. innate immune system provides first line of defense against virus. pathogenesis of PE and hemorrhage in EV71 infections studied. a significant elevation of plasma IL-10, IL-13, and interferon levels is observed in patients with PE. proinflammatory cytokines may play a central role in EV71 BE. the interaction of EV71 with PSGL-1 on lymphocytes may induce production of the inflammatory cytokines involved in BE. infected mice showed reduced tissue damage, absence of splenic atrophy, and increased CD4+, CD8+ T cells activation. anti-IL-6 treatment at the time of infection is detrimental to the mice. IL-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine with multiple biologic effects. anti-IL-6 treatment resulted in dramatically increased IL-10/IL-6 ratios. increased pulmonary permeability may play a pivotal role in PE. increased pulmonary permeability may play a pivotal role in PE. polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I: C)), a potent IFN inducer, improved the survival rate and decreased the tissue viral titers after EV71 challenge. patients with PE were found to have higher IL-13 levels than those with uncomplicated BE. a synergistic proinflammatory cytokine response may be necessary for the development of EV71-induced PE. cytokines are key regulators of leukocyte migration and play important roles in many physiological and pathological immune and inflammatory contexts. IL-8 was identified as a neutrophil-specific chemotactic factor. plasma levels of IP-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MIG were significantly higher in patients with PE than in those with uncomplicated BE [22]. IP-10 is recognized as a biomarker that predicts severity of various diseases. inflammatory process of echovirus 30 meningitis shifts from production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-) to that of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-1) during or after the period when the virus is eliminated from the cerebrospinal cavity. median CSF level of IL-6 was significantly higher during the first or second day of CNS involvement. IL-1 activates microglia and vascular endothelial cells to recruit peripheral leukocytes and produce neuroinflammation. increased levels of IL-1 mRNA were found only in the CSF and not in the plasma of EV71-infected patients. IL-1 can regulate neurotransmission mediated by amines such as norepinephrine and dopamine. a study of murine brain endothelial cells found that MIG was induced following treatment with a cytokine cocktail containing IFN-, TNF-, and IL-1. this may support the previous findings, the increased CSF level of MIG may relate to the increased CSF level of IL-1 and IFN- in patients with PE. a previous study showed a decrease in plasma concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN- following administration of IVIG in patients with ANS dysregulation and PE. a more favorable survival might have been obtained by modulating cytokine storm and reducing sympathetic activity. the mortality was lower in milrinone-treated than nontreated group. cytokine removal by blood purification was proposed include convection, diffusion, and adsorption. studies have led to the idea that adsorption contributes more strongly to cytokine removal than convection or diffusion in some membrane materials. the appropriate timing and duration of intervention and the possible clinical effectiveness should be taken into consideration in severe EV71-infected patients."}
