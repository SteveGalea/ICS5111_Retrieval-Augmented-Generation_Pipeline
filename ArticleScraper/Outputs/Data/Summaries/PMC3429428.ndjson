{"summary": "the nucleoprotein NP of Lassa virus suppresses host innate immune signaling pathways [1], and may be linked to the profound immune disregulation noted in Lassa Fever infection [2]. a previously unknown exonuclease function for NP, placing it within the DEDDh exonuclease superfamily [4], [4]. crystal structure of the NP exonuclease domain of Lassa NP in complex with eight bases of dsRNA. this structure demonstrates that the unique substrate specificity is conferred by an extremely limited number of residues outside the active site. oligos were resuspended in nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 1 mM. structure determination of LASV NP340/E391A\u2013dsRNA by molecular replacement was carried out in PHENIX[15] using the uncomplexed NP340 structure as a search model. initial Fo-Fc difference maps and 2Fo-Fc maps generated from the molecular replacement solution showed clear density for NP340, as well as additional density for the dsRNA. final 2Fo-Fc, contoured at +2.0, of the dsRNA bound to Lassa NP. the substrate strand, which leads into the active site, is colored blue and the non-substrate strand is colored yellow. oligonucleotides were labeled with P32 using protein nucleotide kinase. reactions contained 50 nM wild-type or mutant NP340 and 2 nM (labeled) and 10 nM (unlabeled) oligo(ribo)nucleotide. oligos were resuspended in nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 1 mM. tris pH 8.0 and NaCl were added to the dsRNA to achieve final concentrations of 10 mM and 300 mM. model building was performed using Coot [16] and subsequent rounds of refinement were carried out using PHENIX. 5% of the reflections were set aside for R free calculations. custom hydrogen-bonding restraints between base-pairing nucleotides were generated using the \u2018PDB to 3D restraints\u2019 server [17] to maintain proper RNA base hydrogen-bonding distances. oligonucleotides were labeled with P32 using protein nucleotide kinase according to the manufacturers directions (NEB) standard reactions contained 50 nM wild-type or mutant NP340 and 2 nM (labeled) and 10 nM (unlabeled) oligo(ribo)nucleotide. reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 after incubation for 15 minutes. gels were exposed overnight to a phosphorscreen and then imaged using a Typhoon phosphorimager. each strand of RNA is composed of either all-purine or all-pyrimidine bases. the single all-purine and all-pyrimidine strands were annealed to yield dsRNAs that each contain one all-purine and one all-pyrimidine strand. digestion of dsRNA by Lassa NP is sequence-independent. only one of the two cations is present in the active site in the crystal structure (site B) this site B cation is modeled as a magnesium ion, because of the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 in the crystallization buffer. the site B ion Lassa NP may also be coordinated by water in a similar fashion. both cations are apparent in complex with mononucleotides. arrow indicates position of next nucleotide in digested strand. RNA base G8 is also observed to make several contacts to protein residues. D426 hydrogen bonds to its nitrogenous base, and the main chain nitrogen of G392 makes hydrogen bonds to the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032OH of its ribose sugar. the non-substrate strand forms hydrogen bonds between the 2\u2032OH of C1 and Q425, and the 2\u2032OH of C4 and D465. mutation of Y429 to phenylalanine and mutation of Q425, D426 and D465 to alanine have no effect on exonuclease activity. wild-type, full-length NP or the immunosuppressive domain of NP (NP340) were incubated with 18 bp blunt-ended dsRNA for 15 min. our structure of NP bound to dsRNA demonstrates that contacts to the non-substrate strand are to the 2\u2032OH of the ribose groups. however, these contacts appear to be non-essential. this observation led us to speculate that the non-substrate strand could be DNA as well as RNA. NP340E391A is able to bind dsRNA, but cannot catalyze the exonuclease reaction to digest it. the single all-purine and all-pyrimidine strands were annealed to yield dsRNAs that each contain one all-purine strand. one of the two divalent cations required for the exonuclease activity bound in the active site is modeled as Mg. the second active site divalent cation is not bound due to required mutation of E391 to alanine to prevent dsRNA digestion. only one of the two cations is present in the active site in the crystal structure (site B) the phosphate backbone of the terminal 3\u2032 nucleotide (G8) is coordinated by a divalent cation (modeled here as a Mg ion, MgB) and by H528. the second catalytic divalent ion is not bound in the active site. the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 OH groups of G8 form hydrogen bonds to the main-chain nitrogen of G392. the substrate strand forms hydrogen bonds to the NP through the phosphate backbone and by contacts to G8. the main chain nitrogen of G392 makes hydrogen bonds to the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032OH of its ribose sugar. mutant for exonuclease function prevents digestion of dsRNA. mutation of Y429 to phenylalanine and mutation of Q425, D426 and D465 to alanine have no effect on exonuclease activity. dsRNA is digested within five minutes. Y429A and Y429L-containing NPs show incomplete digestion even after 60 minutes. however, both of these mutations allow at least one nucleotide to be removed. however, these contacts appear to be non-essential. dsRNA bound to dsRNA was aligned with the Klenow fragment exonuclease domain (KF) bound to dsDNA. the structures of Lassa NP and KF align with an r.m.s.d of 3.6. mutation of this basic loop in KF and Trex2 reduces exonuclease activity [9], [21], suggesting a role for the motif in binding nucleic acid. in Lassa NP, the site that is positionally equivalent to the basic loop of the other exonucleases is neither basic nor loop-shaped, but rather much shorter and mostly hydrophobic. strand 5 and helix 5 are directly connected by an IDIAL hydrophobic sequence (residues I482 to L486) strand 5 and helix 5 are directly connected by an IDIAL hydrophobic sequence. this loop contains K516, K517, K518 and R519. dsRNA is naturally found as A-form in the cell. a hydrogen bond between the RNA-specific 2\u2032OH and the G392 in the active site could explain why the exonuclease activity of Lassa NP is specific for RNA over DNA. mutation of nsp14 may force the active site into a non-functional arrangement. nsp14 digests ssRNA and dsRNA, but not DNA. nsp14 also has a conserved glycine in the same position as Lassa NP G392. this work provides a template for design of anti-viral inhibitors of Lassa virus that could selectively target NP while leaving human DEDD exonucleases unaffected."}
