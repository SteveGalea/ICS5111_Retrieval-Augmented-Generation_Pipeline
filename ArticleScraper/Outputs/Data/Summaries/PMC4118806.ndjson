{"summary": "HCoV-NL63 can be detected in as high as 1.0\u20139.3% of respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. HCoV-NL63 contains a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome that encodes two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) by two virus-encoded proteins. the sequence similarity of HCoV-NL63 protease to those of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and SARS-CoV is 60 and 44%, respectively. the idea of designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoVs has been proposed. the supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) for purifying the GST-tagged HCoV-NL63 main protease. the fusion protein was then subjected to on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (Pharmacia) at 277 K for 18 h. the protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 dissolved in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM as a stock, was added to purified protein at a molar ratio between 3:1 and 5:1. the protein complex was centrifuged at 12 000g for 10 min and exchanged into a buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. the crystals were cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 0.1 M HEPES pH 5.5, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 4%(v/v) ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol and then mounted in a nylon loop and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. all intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 package. the solvent content was 59.8%, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. a final diffraction data set was collected to 2.85 resolution. the related data-collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. the coding sequence for HCoV-NL63 main protease was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 plasmid and verified by sequencing. cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml1 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. the protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml1. the buffer used for proteolysis was PBS. the resulting protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) the final protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml1 for crystallization. the method was used to screen for initial crystallization conditions. crystals with typical dimensions of 0.1 0.05 0.03 mm appeared after about 48 h using condition no. 11 of Crystal Screen. all intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 package. the diffraction data set was firstly indexed in space group P4. the rectangular box shows a diffraction spot in the outer resolution shell. the rectangular box shows a diffraction spot in the outer resolution shell. eight coplanar peaks are indicated, 45\u00b0 apart from each other. the crystals of the protease complex belonged to space group P41212. the crystals belonged to space group P41212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 87.2."}
