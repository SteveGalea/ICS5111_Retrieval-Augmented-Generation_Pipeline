{"summary": "a total of fifty-eight reviews were eligible for our study. twenty-one of the included reviews had at least one TCM practitioner as its co-author. systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are becoming increasingly important as a source of evidence for decision-making. some studies have assessed the quality of CHM reviews published in Chinese journals, in general, they have been criticized for lacking a comprehensive search for clinical trials. some studies have assessed the quality of CHM reviews published in paper-based journals. reviews focusing on CHM were excluded from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) we included all reviews contained in the CDSR (Issue 5, 2010) using terms: Chinese or herb* or traditional or plant or medic*. data extraction We established a database (using Microsoft Excel 2007) to extract data. the database had two components: 1) general characteristics, including country of first author and number of authors, whether the review had the participation of TCM practitioners, number of trials and participants included, disease, year of review last assessed as up-to-date. literature search In order to identify reviews focusing on CHM, we searched the titles and abstracts of all reviews contained within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) we defined CHM as preparations derived from plants or parts of plants that grow in China and have been widely used for medical purposes. question 10 is an assessment of the overall scientific quality of the systematic review on a scale of 1 to 7. the first 9 questions are designed to assess different aspects of methodological quality and have set answers of \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cpartially/can't tell\u201d, or \u201cno\u201d. a review was believed to have the participation of TCM practitioners if at least one author works in TCM department, university or hospital, or it stated that it had got suggestion from TCM practitioners. a total of 58 Cochrane reviews [11]\u2013[68] were eligible for our study, a full list of reviews is included in Table S1. of the 51 nonempty reviews, only one review concluded positively, 27 (53%) concluded that there might be benefit of CHM for treating specific health conditions. nineteen reviews focused on 13 single herbs or herbal preparations. 5 reviews involved a family of herbal medicines sharing similar efficacy. 41 of 58 reviews attempted to minimize bias during the selection of studies by at least two reviewers independently select eligible studies. the median number of databases searched in 58 reviews was 7 within a range of 4. the most searched was MEDLINE (98%), followed by EMBASE (97%) and CENTRAL (97%). CBM was the most searched Chinese database (78%), the second most used was CNKI (45%) and the third was VIP (24%). the number of authors in the 58 reviews ranged from 1 to 10, the first authors were most often from china (46 [79%]), followed by UK (n = 8), and Netherlands, Canada, USA and Australia each have one first-authored review. 7 (12%) reviews didn't include any primary study, of the remaining reviews (n = 51), a total of 671 studies and 75,609 participants were included. the median number of herbal medicines involved was 6 within a range of 1 to 71. results of different herbal medicines pooled in 9 reviews. 41 of 58 reviews attempted to minimize bias during selection of studies by at least two reviewers independently select eligible studies. the most searched database was MEDLINE (98%), followed by EMBASE (97%) and CENTRAL (97%). CBM was the most searched Chinese database (78%), the second most used was CNKI (45%) and VIP (24%). CDSR has included 58 systematic reviews of CHM. a systematic review of CHM for coronary heart disease will have to include clinical trials of all these. a systematic review of CHM is to identify relevant studies completely and unbiasedly [70] it has been demonstrated that significant amounts of evidence would potentially be missed if the search is limited to English-only sources. the aim of a systematic review is to identify relevant studies completely and unbiasedly [70] more than sixty percent of reviews did not have one TCM practitioner in the authors list. we suggest future reviews should be authored by a group of individuals with both clinical expertise and methodological expertise. nearly half of reviews were reported as being inconclusive. this may cause the results of this study to be only applicable to review articles in the Cochrane database. further evaluation is needed in order to know whether systematic reviews of CHM published in English paper-based journals even in the leading journals have the same problem."}
