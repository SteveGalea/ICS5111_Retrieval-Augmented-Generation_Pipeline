{"summary": "a single non-synonymous mutation can alter the phenotype. the evolution and epidemiology are interdependent. the continued spread of a virus via vector species into new hosts relies on its ability to adapt. the existence of multiple strains is common amongst animal viruses. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the only closterovirus species to possess multiple, phylogenetically distinct strains. CTV causes three major host reactions or syndromes: seedling yellows, stem pitting, and quick decline. citrus tristeza virus diseases, in all their forms, are the result of concentrated agricultural production; a setting quite unlike the natural environment in which both citrus and CTV evolved. monoculture production promotes the occurrence of tristeza epidemics, which punctuated the last century in south America in the 1930s and early 1940s. the VT-like and T30-like isolates on one hand, and the T36-like on the other. new genotypes have diverged from the ancestral population, or have arisen through recombination with previously described strains. the existence of multiple strains is responsible for the wide range of phenotypes observed within and between different citrus cultivars and species. a standardized system of classification for identifying and grouping the strains present around the world is also proposed. an infectious clone based on the T36 isolate that was maintained under glasshouse conditions for 7 years in a single host was also examined.

VT strain with an average nucleotide identity of 99.4% (Table 2) may be due in part to the sequencing of isolates from one geographic locale. there is a small divergence of 0.46\u20130.57% at the nucleotide level between the type isolate of the strain, T36. minor changes are significant in that the T36 isolate is phenotypically different from the extant field isolates. onymous substitutions are located in ORF1a (positions 606 T-A and 2228 T-I), p61 (324 G-D), and p18 (59 I-V, and 129 K-M) two of the substitutions restored the residue to that found in the T36-like field samples, while the others introduced amino acids of similar properties. this indicates a very slow rate of evolution in a single CTV isolate, under stable conditions, over time. the evolution of Citrus tristeza virus strains The adaptive landscape, first proposed by Wright (1932) is a means of projecting all possible mutations and gene combinations of a species or population onto a topography on which selective pressures from the environment create fitness peaks and valleys. if we apply this metaphor to CTV, can we reconstruct the evolution of the landscape is to evolve. recombination, particularly between species, allows a distinct shift in evolutionary trajectory. such shifts cannot occur by stepwise mutation alone, unless the selective constraints are relaxed. the extant recombinant CTV sequences HA16-5 (Melzer et al., 2010) and NZ-M16 (Melzer et al., 2010) indicate that 5\u2032-3\u2032 recombination events are common. dRNAs are frequently found in mixture with intact CTV isolates. dRNAs are often found in mixture with intact CTV isolates. but evidence for divergence, or eventual mutational meltdown and elimination via Muller\u2019s ratchet, is lacking. similar results were reported by Martin et al. (2009). the strength of selection is not consistent within a single gene. each of the functional domains showed a higher percentage of negatively selected residues and conversely fewer positively selected residues. the rapidly evolving regions are involved in host-pathogen interaction or defense responses, indicating the importance of external factors on evolutionary rates. p23, p61, ORF1a, and ORF1b had multiple positive selection events in lineages leading to the extant CTV strains. the first two genes are responsible for suppression of silencing, as well as controlling negative strand accumulation. strain-specific mutations may be the result of adaptation to specific hosts. p61 protein is a HSP90-type molecular chaperone involved in CTV virion assembly. strain-specific diversification of p61 may be involved in host-interaction or as a pathogenicity factor. the extent of the divergence observed in ORF1a differs between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves of the genome. the extent of the divergence is due in part to extensive recombination. recombination is a significant factor in the emergence of new CTV strains. ation can repair defective sequences and allow a rapid change in fitness. the probability of generating a viable recombinant depends on viral and host factors. it requires that both parental strains be present in the same host. recombinant must then be able to replicate and establish a systemic infection. it may be proposed that complete replacement of the 5\u2032 half avoids a reduction in fitness. sites at which recombination can occur may be limited to specific hotspots. such sites have been observed in PPV (Glasa et al., 2002), watermelon bud necrosis virus (Kumar et al., 2010), and Brome mosaic virus (Olsthoorn et al., 2002; Shapka and Nagy, if super-infection exclusion of a newly generated recombinant occurs, this reduces the probability it will become fixed in the population, or be acquired by an aphid vector. this reduces the probability it will become fixed in the population, or be acquired by an aphid vector and transmitted to a new host, thus in all likelihood leading to extinction. a range of host species creates a bewildering array of potential selective factors, peaks, and valleys across the landscape. each species will differ to some degree in physiology, gene expression, metabolism, and antiviral defenses. an isolate at an adaptive peak in one host may be less fit in another. differential reactions to CTV strains have also been observed in P. trifoliata and C. maxima (Garnsey et al., 1996) suggesting host-specificity has contributed to the diversity of strains observed today. a host-specificity has contributed to the diversity of strains observed. resistance genes in P. trifoliata restrict virus movement. RNA interference targets the viral genome for degradation via host- and pathogen-derived small interfering RNAs. differences in host cellular siRNAs have been proposed to determine whether specific tissues are permissive of viral infection. aphid vector species exerts selective pressure on CTV isolates by selectively transmitting some isolates or strains rather than others. the same vector species will also transmit strains or isolates at different rates. the same vector species will also transmit strains or isolates at different rates. aphid transmission removes a proportion of the quasispecies from the source plant. the T36 isolate is less pathogenic than most field isolates. it is also very poorly transmitted by aphid species compared to other isolates of the strain. CP, ORF1a/b, and sundry 3\u2032 genes all being targeted in different assays. the coat protein is the most highly conserved and least variable of the 3\u2032 genes with 93.4% nucleotide identity and 96.3% amino acid identity between isolates examined in this study. CP is not reflective of the complete genome and can in no way explain the divergent 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves of CTV strains. divergence between strains, such as VT and T3, is most apparent in the 5\u2032 end of the genome. ideally, one would require the complete genome to be amplified to make an accurate diagnosis of strain type and to identify potential recombinants. s of VT be recognized with type isolates T318A (DQ151548) and FS701 (KC517494) until a similar sequence is found, the classification remains tentative. a novel strain must be examined for recombination with the type members of the extant strains listed above. strains may have evolved through either a single introduction into citrus and subsequent radiation, or through multiple introductions followed by recombination. recombination, rather than mutation, has been shown to be the major factor in strain evolution, producing three of the six extant strains. recombination between a proto-CTV isolate and an unknown closterovirus. recombination allows a distinct shift in evolutionary trajectory. recombination, particularly between species, allows a distinct shift in evolutionary trajectory. HA16-5 and NZ-M16, as well as the T68 and RB strains, indicate that 5\u2032-3\u2032 recombination events are common. the ORF1b-p33 junction may represent a selectively favored site for recombination as has been observed in other virus species. if we consider VT, T3, and T30, which share 90.6% nucleotide identity in ORF1a to be descendants of one proto-CTV, this recombinant origin of asymmetrical 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves cannot be conclusively proven. selective pressures are not equal across the genome can be inferred from the FEL and MEME analysis. the percentage of negatively selected sites varied from 19.6 to 54.8% per ORF. low rate of nucleotide substitutions, or rate of evolution, estimated to be 1.73 105 nucleotide changes, per site, per year based on coat protein sequences. estimating substitution rates assumes a constant rate of evolution, whereas a population may evolve rapidly when confronted with a changing landscape of selective conditions. p23, p61, ORF1a, and ORF1b had multiple positive selection events in lineages leading to the extant CTV strains. the first two genes are responsible for suppression of silencing and controlling negative strand accumulation. strain-specific mutations may be the result of adaptation to specific hosts. replication components, ORF1a and 1b have evolved under host-specific selection. 61 may be involved in host-interaction or as a pathogenicity factor. recombination is a significant factor in CTV evolution. recombination allows a population to leap from fitness peak to peak if selectively favored. but if not it can be akin to jumping off a cliff, leading to extinction of that genotype. recombinants have long been known to be a factor in the emergence of new CTV strains. the majority of CTV recombinants identified are between isolates of more closely related strains, for example in Kpg3 and NZ-M16 between VT and T3, in NZ-B18 and B165 between VT and VT. the exception is the complete replacement of the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 half of the genome, an event that has produced the RB and T68 strains. if viable, the recombinant faces competition with, and selection against, other CTV isolates in the population. if viable, the recombinant faces competition with, and selection against, other CTV isolates in the population. this is of particular importance as CTV isolates have been shown to exclude super-infection by closely related sequences. two other plant viruses with recognized strain diversification exhibit significant host diversification. the latter infects over 1000 herbaceous, shrub, and tree species. the host range of CTV is limited to members of the Rutaceae. a range of host species creates a bewildering array of potential selective factors, peaks, and valleys across the landscape. each species will differ to some degree in physiology, gene expression, metabolism, and antiviral defenses. an isolate at an adaptive peak in one host may be less fit in another. host-specificity has contributed to the diversity of strains observed today. host defenses play a significant role in determining the topography of the adaptive landscape. host defenses play a significant role in determining the topography of the adaptive landscape. virally encoded suppressors of silencing are found in potexviruses, potyviruses, cucumoviruses, and closteroviruses. the latter two were observed in this study to show significant variation between strains. aphid species exerts selective pressure on CTV isolates by selectively transmitting some isolates or strains rather than others. a member of the same genotype was unable to be transmitted by T. citricida. the same vector species will also transmit strains or isolates at different rates. the same vector species will also transmit strains or isolates at different rates. isolated strains have been classified and grouped by their phenotype, virulence, host range, serology, and more recently, using sequence homology of one or more genes. the link between genotype and phenotype is also unclear. the link between genotype and phenotype is also unclear. the coat protein is the most highly conserved and least variable of the 3\u2032 genes with 93.4% nucleotide identity and 96.3% amino acid identity between isolates examined in this study. the CP is not reflective of the complete genome and can in no way explain the divergent 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves of CTV strains, nor extensive recombination. in this study we have described six strains of CTV named T36, VT, T3, RB, T68, and T30, defined by separation of their complete genome phylogenies. we further propose that the type isolates for each strain be assigned as follows: T36: isolate T36 (U16304), T3: isolate T3 (KC525952), T30: isolate T30 (AY260651), RB: isolate NZRB-TH28 (FJ525433), the complete genome sequence should differ by >7.5% at the nucleotide level, the minimum distance between VT and T3, and by >8% at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels in ORF1a. a novel strain must be examined for recombination with the type members of the extant strains listed above to be classified. the existence of strains, if defined as distinct phylogenetic groups with a shared ancestry, is a rare phenomenon among on codon choice have acted to decrease the likelihood of moving between adaptive peaks by mutation alone. recombination has been shown to be the major factor in CTV strain evolution. evidence suggests that co-evolution reduces likelihood of recombination between any two strains."}
