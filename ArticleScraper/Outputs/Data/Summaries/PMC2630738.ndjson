{"summary": "case-patients were defined as patients with asthma exacerbation. controls were defined as patients with stable asthma. information on symptoms of acute viral respiratory illness was also collected. no increase in asthma symptom frequency in past wk Acute respiratory viral illness >2 of the following: fever, stuffy/runny nose, headache, muscle aches, and pain or redness of eye(s) at the time of clinic visit or hospital admission. seminested RT-PCR in 53 (37%) of 142 children with asthma, including 39 (60%) of 65 case-patients and 14 (18%) of 77 controls. specimens from patients with symptoms of acute viral respiratory infection were more likely to yield sufficient VP1 amplicon for genotyping. 0 GA23584 Unknown 1 1 0 0 Species B 3 1 0 2 HRV48 Major 1 0 0 1 HRV99 Major 2 1 0 1 Genogroup C Unknown 8 4 4 0 Not genotyped Unknown 24 3 12 9 *HRV, human rhinovirus; case-patients, asthma patients with exacerbations; controls, asthma patients without exacerbation. sequences of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) identified in 29 HRV-positive pediatric asthma patients. previously published sequences of strains QPM (GenBank accession no. EF186077), C024-C026 (accession nos. EF582385\u2013EF582387), NAT001 and NAT045 (accession nos. EF077279\u2013EF077280) the association of asthma exacerbations with HRV infection appeared to be largely driven by the novel genogroup C. the association was statistically significant for species A (detected in 15 [23%] of 65 case-patients vs. 3 [4%] of 77 controls; OR 7.4; 95% CI 1.9\u201343.1; p0.001) but not for infrequently identified species B (detected in 1 [2%] case-patient vs. 2 [3% lower FEV1 with genogroup C infection than with other HRVs suggests a potentially greater severity of asthma exacerbation in patients with these HRVs. genogroup-related differences in associated disease patterns have implications for clinical management of HRV infections in asthma patients."}
