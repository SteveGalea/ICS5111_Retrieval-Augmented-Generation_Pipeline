{"summary": "common causative organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. in some cases, both a viral and bacterial source contribute to the development of CAP. in some cases, both a viral and bacterial source contribute to the development of CAP. the patient was documented as up-to-date with immunizations, including seasonal influenza vaccine, and did not attend daycare. her labs were negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza A and B, as well as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) all obtained via nasopharyngeal swab 34 minutes after presentation to the ED. CT of the chest confirmed a large left pleural effusion and lobar consolidation with major atelectasis and mediastinal shift. the patient received 3 days of ceftriaxone 15 mg/kg initial dose in the ED followed by 50 mg/kg/day and 2 days of vancomycin 10 mg/kg Q6H. repeat CXRs showed persistent infiltrate in the left lower lobe. she was extubated without complication on hospital day 6. repeated CXRs showed persistent infiltrate in the left lower lobe. the patient was sent home on hospital day 18 with the chest tube and Heimlich valve in place and plan to follow-up with outpatient pediatric surgery in one week. a referral to outpatient pediatric pulmonology was also scheduled. the patient presented with single occurrence of seizure-like activity and prolonged cough, fever, and dyspnea. this patient repeatedly tested negative for bacterial etiologies of parapneumonic effusion, heightening our suspicion for viral cause of pneumonia. rhinovirus was the second most common detected pathogen (in 27% of children) the incidence of RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and S. pneumoniae were higher amongst children younger than 5 years of age. inflammatory markers are not highly specific in differentiation between viral versus bacterial cause of infection. studies may benefit from better biomarkers or microbiologic methods to confirm or exclude bacterial coinfection in rhinovirus-associated CAP. in their 2015 study, 44% of detectable pathogens were viral and only 8% were bacterial. the patient's seizure-like activity increased our clinical suspicion for a possible underlying viral etiology. oseltamivir has been shown to be weakly cytotoxic. erobic or MRSA coverage would be switched to oral once drainage is complete. antibiotics would be switched to oral once drainage is complete and patient improves without oxygen. thoracentesis is not routinely used in all patients. the use of VATS results in earlier, more complete resolution of the infection. there was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, failure rate, days of oxygen requirements, analgesic requirement, and radiologic outcomes. the benefits of these procedures certainly outweighed the cost in her case. rhinovirus was the second most common detected pathogen (in 27% of children), second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) the incidence of RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and S. pneumoniae were higher amongst children younger than 5 years of age. methods to confirm or exclude bacterial coinfection in rhinovirus-associated CAP. our approach followed the national guidelines for the management of CAP. the first set of cultures was drawn 34 minutes after arrival to the ED and 90 minutes before the start of ceftriaxone. rile seizures are a clinical diagnosis with still unknown exact etiology. but high levels of proinflammatory cytokines released during viral infection may be linked to the onset of febrile seizures in pediatric patients. oseltamivir has been shown to be weakly cytotoxic; oseltamivir has been shown to be weakly cytotoxic. VATS is performed under general anesthesia with the patient in a supine position and affected side of the chest elevated at 45 degrees to provide adequate exposure and prevent secretion overflow. the benefits of VATS, however, outweighed the risk in this case since the patient already experienced mediastinal shift from the progressing infection. VATS was compared with fibrinolytic agents as initial therapy for empyema in pediatric studies. there was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, failure rate, days of oxygen requirements, analgesic requirement, and radiologic outcomes."}
