ORF10,071\u201310,331 was detected by mass spectrometry. the mass spectrometry analysis also detected all the previously known and predicted SHFV nonstructural proteins except for nsp6. the protein ORFs located at the 3\u2032 end of the genome are expressed from a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of sg mRNAs. the synthesis of the minus-strand templates for these sg mRNAs is regulated by TRSs. eight body TRSs were initially identified in the SHFV genome, with each considered to be the TRS used for generating the sg RNA of one of the known structural proteins. sg mRNAs produced from each of these nine TRSs were predicted to encode the same in-frame, C-terminal peptide of GP5 (ORF5-C-68aa) the start codon for this ORF is located downstream of the last GP5 transmembrane domain, so this protein would be expected to be located in the cytoplasm of infected cells. no evidence of function in cell culture was obtained for the ORF4\u2032-C-84aa, ORF2a-C-161aa, and ORF2a\u2032-C-25aa proteins. a total of 36 functional TRSs were subsequently identified by amplification, cloning, and sequencing. another 51 were identified by NGS analysis of SHFV sg mRNAs from infected MA104 cells. sg mRNAs produced from these alternative body TRSs were lower than that from the major TRS. the combined amount produced from them was sufficient to generate infectious progeny virus when the major TRS was inactivated. however, the relative protein level correlated well with the total sg mRNA abundance produced from multiple TRSs. multiple sg mRNAs were also identified with GP2 as the 5\u2032 ORF. but the protein abundance estimated for GP2 was equivalent to that for E. sg mRNAs expressing GP2 as the 5\u2032 ORF are produced at low levels. the total abundance of sg mRNA generated at each body TRS was consistent at early and late times post infection in two different cell types. previous studies showed that increasing the duplex stability between leader\u2013body TRSs by site-directed mutagenesis enhanced sg mRNA synthesis but that duplex stability was not the only determinant. SHFV ORF1a/1b region produced long sg mRNAs encoding different lengths of in-frame, C-terminal portions of ORF1b (truncated ORF1b) a previous study identified a body TRS in ORF1b that produced a long sg mRNA encoding a truncated ORF1b (200 aa) coronaviruses identified additional functional body TRSs that produce sg mRNAs encoding accessory proteins or previously unidentified protein ORFs. only the protein product expressed from ORF10,071\u201310,331, which is located within the ORF1b region, was detected by mass spectrometry analysis. this 86-aa product was the largest among those of the additional alternative reading frame ORFs. frameshift site was previously identified in the nsp2 region of the PRRSV genome. a 2 frameshift would produce a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2 fused to an alternative 225-aa extension. some 1 frameshift activity at the site in the PRRSV genome was also detected and produced a fusion protein (nsp2N) alternating regions of high and low transcription activity detected across the 3\u2032 region of the SHFV genome strongly suggest a role for local secondary and genomic higher-order RNA structures in regulating nidovirus transcription. the discovery of many previously unreported in-frame ORFs and alternative frame ORFs encoded by newly identified sg mRNAs indicates that the coding capacity of the SHFV genome was previously underestimated. cDNA amplified from viral genome RNA was transfected into MA104 cells. culture fluid containing progeny virus was harvested at 24 hpi. the titer of the stock was 1.3 107 pfu/mL. two-thirds of the culture medium was replaced with fresh growth medium every 3 d during differentiation. diluted virus (100 L per well) was adsorbed onto confluent MA104 monolayers in six-well plates for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of human actin RNA of known concentration. a 1-L aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto an Amersham Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and UV cross-linked. the membrane was then blocked in DIG blocking buffer (Roche) and incubated with anti-DIG antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. the lane containing the RNA ladder was cut from the membrane and stained with methylene blue. the rest of the membrane was prehybridized in DIG Easy Hyb buffer (Roche) at 68 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by overnight hybridization with individual DIG-labeled, denatured RNA probes (100 ng/mL) the membrane was then blocked in DIG blocking solution (Roche), incubated with anti-DIG antibody diluted 1:10,000 the remainder of the RT-PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. bands visualized under long-wavelength UV light were excised. the DNAs were eluted, ligated with pCR4-TOPO DNA (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) cell lysates harvested in TRI reagent from four replicate wells were combined. mRNA was extracted from mock and SHFVic-infected macaque M RNA samples. libraries were prepared and subjected to RNA-seq using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. the 15-nt leader\u2013body junction sequences for each of the nine previously identified and 36 newly identified sg mRNAs were also imported as references. all reads that aligned to the SHFV genome (30\u201350% of the total cellular RNA) were then extracted and mapped again to the 15-nt leader sequence (genome nucleotides 186\u2013200) using a high-stringency setting. all reads that mapped to a region in the SHFV genome were then manually searched for previously unidentified leader\u2013body junction sequences. the number of reads mapping to each identified leader\u2013body junction sequence was used as an estimate of the transcription level of the sg mRNA containing that unique junction sequence. each set of primers was used to introduce a single-nucleotide substitution into the appropriate SHFVic fragment (fragment III for GP2\u2032-C, fragment IV for GP4\u2032-C and GP6-C) (25) using a QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. each mutant fragment was ligated to the other four wild-type SHFV genome fragments after digestion with PflMI. at 20 hpi, cell lysates were collected in RIPA buffer (1 PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) the total amount of protein in each cell lysate was measured using a BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the detected SHFV proteins were quantified based on the identified razor plus unique peptides using the iBAQ method (70). the titer of the SHFVic stock was 1.3 107 pfu/mL. the titer was 1.3 107 pfu/mL. two-thirds of the culture medium was replaced with fresh growth medium every 3 d during differentiation. two-thirds of the culture medium was replaced with fresh growth medium every 3 d during differentiation. the concentrations of the DIG-labeled RNA probes were determined by a dot-blot assay using a DIG-labeled human actin RNA standard (Roche) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of human actin RNA of known concentration. a 1-L aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto an Amersham Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and UV cross- membrane was then washed with a low-stringency buffer containing 2 SSC plus 0.1% SDS at room temperature followed by a wash with a high-stringency buffer at 68 \u00b0C. the membrane was then blocked in DIG blocking solution (Roche), incubated with anti-DIG antibody diluted 1:10,000 (Roche), and imaged with an LAS4000 mini Luminescent Image Analyzer (GE Healthcare) RT-PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. the remainder of the RT-PCR product was run on a 2% gel and stained with ethidium bromide. bands visualized under long-wavelength UV light were excised. in T-75 flasks to 100% confluence were infected with SHFVic at an MOI of 1. culture fluid was removed and cell lysates harvested in TRI reagent. mRNA was obtained by poly(A) selection using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies) libraries were prepared and subjected to RNA-seq using Illumina MiSeq. paired-end reads, 75-bp read length, were used to analyse RNA-seq data. the following four sequences were imported as references. sg mRNAs with alternative leader\u2013body junction sequences can be generated from a single TRS. the relative sg mRNA abundance for each TRS was calculated by dividing the total number of reads for all the sg mRNAs produced from a particular TRS. five sets of primers were designed to mutate the start codon of each identified in-frame C-terminal ORF identified but not to change the amino acid sequence translated from the overlapping ORF. each set of primers was used to introduce a single-nucleotide substitution into the appropriate SHFVic fragment (fragment III for GP2\u2032-C, fragment IV for GP4\u2032-C and GP6-C) (25) using a QuikChange Lightning Site- MA104 cells were seeded in a six-well plate until confluent. then infected with SHFVic virus at an MOI of 3. total amount of protein in each cell lysate was measured using a BCA assay. the detected SHFV proteins were quantified using the iBAQ method."}
