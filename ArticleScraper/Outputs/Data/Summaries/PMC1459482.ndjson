{"summary": "rAd encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) has been shown to confer specific protective immunity in nonhuman primates. multiple GP forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine. scientists are working on a vaccine that could be given to people before they get infected and then protect them when they come in contact with the virus. the vaccine could be given to people before they get infected and then protect them when they come in contact with the virus. a number of candidate vaccines have been developed and tested in animals. researchers have now developed a simplified vaccine against Ebola virus that is effective in monkeys. the vaccine consists of only a modified GP component (which is well tolerated by human cells even at high concentrations) and the rAd5 component (which is well tolerated by human cells even at high concentrations) the first clinical trials will test whether the vaccine is safe in humans and whether it can cause the immune system to produce an immune response that is specific for the Ebola virus. scientists will also explore whether this vaccine can protect monkeys against infections with other strains of the Ebola virus. a single immunization with vectors derived from adenovirus type 5 (5 Ad5) elicited protective immune responses within 1 mo. ebola virus comprises four species, ZEBOV, Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Ivory Coast, and Reston. ebola NP was included in the vaccine because it is highly conserved among Ebola subtypes and has been found to elicit strong cellular immune responses in animal models. adenoviruses containing Ebola GP, GPTM, and point mutations were generated by cotransfection of linearized pAdApt-Ebola GP plasmids together with the linearized cosmid pWE.Ad.AfllII-rITRE3. PER.C6 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, San Diego, California, United States expression vectors p1012, pGP, and pTM and point mutants contain a CMV enhancer promoter. the plasmid contained four extra amino acids (aa) at the C terminus. the monkeys, housed singly, were anesthetized with ketamine to obtain blood specimens and to administer vaccines. the animals were maintained in the maximum Containment Laboratory (BSL-4) and fed and checked daily. analysis was conducted using a becton-Dickinson four-color Calibur flow cytometer and FlowJo analysis software. ELISA Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp plates were coated with 100 l/well of 10 g/ml lectin from Galanthus nivalis (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. 293T cells were plated at a density of 2106 per 10-cm diameter tissue culture dish. cells were transfected overnight, washed, and replenished with fresh medium. supernatants were harvested 48 h later, filtered through a 0.45-m pore-size syringe filter. intracellular Cytokine analysis Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from cynomolgus macaque whole blood samples by separation over Ficoll. 167 15-mers overlapping by 11 spanning the entire Ebola glycoprotein at a final concentration of 2.5 g/ml. adenoviruses containing Ebola GP, GPTM, and point mutations were generated by cotransfection of linearized pAdApt-Ebola GP plasmids together with the cosmid pWE.Ad.AfllII-rITRE3. the adaptor plasmid contained the left portion of the Ad5 genome (nucleotides 1\u2013454). clones were amplified for large-scale production using PER.C6 cells in 48 triple-layer 3 175 cm2 flasks. adenovirus-mediated Ebola GP expression was assessed by infection of A549 cells. expression vectors p1012, pGP, and pTM and point mutants contain a CMV enhancer promoter. atants or lysates were evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with a GP-specific polyclonal antibody kindly provided by A. Sanchez. each treatment group contained three animals unless stated otherwise. the adenovirus stock used in this study was originally obtained from a fatally infected human from the former Zaire in 1995. the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum, incubated with FITC- or PE-conjugated secondary antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid Ebola GP(TM) supernatants were added to the plates at a concentration of 0.8\u20131.3 mg/ml total protein in 100 l/well. plates were then washed six times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% fetal calf serum. a total of 167 15-mers overlapping by 11 spanning the entire Ebola glycoprotein at a final concentration of 2.5 g/ml. cells were fixed and permeabilized with FACS Lyse (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, California, United States) samples were run on a FACS Calibur or FACS Aria flow cytometer. positive gating for lymphocytes was followed by CD3+/CD8 and CD3+/CD4 gating. at least 200,000 events were analyzed for each sample. deletion of the transmembrane domain eliminated GP-induced cytopathicity in transfected HEK293 cells. total TM expression was equivalent to wild-type protein levels. cynomolgus macaques were immunized with rAd vectors encoding NP and either TM(Z) or GP(Z) titers were low, and were absent in some surviving animals. deletion of the GP transmembrane domain reduces vaccine efficacy. the 1012 group contains only three CD8 points due to technical error. results represent the percent cytokine-positive in the gated lymphocyte group. background stimulation (DMSO alone) has been subtracted from each sample. no clear correlation between viremia and mortality has been established in nonhuman primate models of Ebola virus infection. survival was therefore used as the study endpoint in these experiments. intracellular flow cytometry was performed to quantify TNF- production from Ebola-specific CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes. results represent the percent cytokine positive in the gated lymphocyte group and background stimulation (DMSO alone) has been subtracted from each sample. HEK293 cells were transfected with a control plasmid (red line) or plasmids expressing wild-type (GP[Z], blue line), or mutant (E71D[Z], green line) proteins. cells were harvested and stained with a GP-specific antibody. ebola GP-specific responses in T lymphocytes detected by intracellular staining of TNF- did not show statistically significant differences in the CD4+ population between different immunization groups. individual differences in the CD8+ response did not correlate with survival. antigen-specific ELISA IgG, which correlated well with survival in the dose-ranging experiment, was also stimulated in all immunized animals. ELISA results represent endpoint dilution titers determined by optical density. cynomolgus macaques were immunized with rAd vectors encoding NP and either TM(Z) or GP(Z) to determine if the TM mutant could protect against infectious Ebola challenge. 1011 particles of TM alone failed to protect against infection. antigen-specific cellular responses measured by intracellular cytokine (tumor necrosis factor- [TNF-]) secretion were indistinguishable between GP(Z)- and TM(Z)-vaccinated animals. different immunization groups had n = 3, except for the GP(Z) + NP (1012) group (n = 4), and control (n = 1). Immune responses were measured at 3 wk postimmunization. results represent the percent cytokine-positive in the gated lymphocyte group. animals were immunized with rAd vectors encoding GP(Z) and NP. survival was 100% in all groups receiving a dose of 1010 or greater. challenge infection was uniformly lethal in the 109 dose group. gG titers may be a stronger predictor of protective immunity for this vaccine. threshold for immunity protection lies at about 1010 rAd particles. subsequent experiments were carried out using this dose to increase sensitivity. GP proteins bearing single-amino acid changes were screened for decreased cell rounding but wild-type levels of expression and reactivity with conformation-dependent antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with a control plasmid (red line) or plasmids expressing wild-type (GP[Z], blue line), or mutant (E71D[Z], green line) proteins. cell monolayers were visualized under phase contrast using a Nikon 40 objective. the mutants were evaluated for their ability to induce protective immunity alone or in combination with NP, compared with the wild-type GP/NP immunogen. survival of cynomolgus macaques immunized in these groups was diminished by 33% and 66%, respectively. intracellular flow cytometry was performed to quantify TNF- production from Ebola-specific CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes. results represent the percent cytokine positive in the gated lymphocyte group. results represent the percent cytokine positive in the gated lymphocyte group. TM(Z) vaccine was less efficacious than wild-type GP(Z) in protecting cynomolgus macaques against infection. TM(Z) may differ from wild-type GP(Z) in antigenic qualities that are not captured by measurements of total antigen-specific IgG. protective immunity was evaluated against challenge with this species, Zaire ebolavirus. preliminary studies suggest that protection can be observed in animals receiving the bivalent vaccine that survive ZEBOV challenge when exposed to the Gulu strain of SEBOV. immunity follows a single injection with 1010 rAd particles, a dose that is two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported for this single-modality vaccine. rAd vectors have proved to be well tolerated and immunogenic for other recombinant genes in vivo and can be evaluated for the vectors reported here. a first-generation Ebola DNA vaccine is currently under evaluation in phase I clinical studies. elimination of NP from the vaccine and dose reductions to 1010 rAd particles do not diminish protection, and simplify the vaccine for future development in human trials."}
