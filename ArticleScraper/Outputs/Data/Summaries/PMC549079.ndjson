{"summary": "quantitative mRNA expression analysis has become the favoured tool in virus diagnostics. real-time PCR has outperformed classical and semi-quantitative PCR methods. but the most prominent problem in quantitative mRNA expression analysis is the selection of an appropriate control gene. the candidate reference genes were evaluated by the bestKeeper tool [6], the GeNorm tool [7] and the algorithm we described previously [5]. results An efficient infection could be evidenced by a significant increase of viral RNA or DNA for all 5 viruses over time (table 1). all other genes showed moderate total SD values (sumv = 2.29 for both), followed by GAP (sumv = 3.49) and 2M (sumv = 3.96) all other genes showed moderate total SD values (sumv > 4.58), except Act (sumv = 11.28), confirming to be the most inappropriate reference gene.
