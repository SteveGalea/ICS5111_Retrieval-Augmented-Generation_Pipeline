{"summary": "the classical role of Na,K-ATPase is to maintain the electrolyte homeostasis of the cells by pumping cations in and out of the cell using the energy obtained from the hydrolysis of (Adenosine triphosphate) ATP. however, it is also a key scaffolding protein that is able to interact with signaling proteins such as protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K in this review, we analyze both the effects that viral infection has on the Na,K-ATPase function and the effect of Na,K-ATPase ligands cardiac glycosides on viral biology. we will also review the mechanisms by which these drugs impair the replication of different types of viruses. the expression of human parvovirus VP1 decreases Na,K-ATPase activity in Xenopus oocytes partially due to the VP1 phospholipase A2 activity dependent formation of lysophosphatidylcholine. infection by RNA viruses can also affect the expression and activity of the Na,K-ATPase. cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na,K-ATPase pump function. digitoxin inhibits HSV replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.05 M, while the EC50 for classical anti HSV drugs is higher than 1.5 M. adenoviruses, which are common human pathogens, are also susceptible to cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digoxin. digitoxin and digoxin are also able to impair adenovirus genome replication by altering the host pre-RNA splicing machinery. other RNA viruses are affected by Na,K-ATPase inhibition. the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of seasonal respiratory disease in children. ebola virus (EV), which triggers severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high mortality rate, can be inhibited by cardiac glycosides. authors have shown that ouabain does not affect the budding rate of the influenza virus in MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) infected cells [45]. Interestingly, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can also be susceptible to cardiac glycosides treatment. antiviral mechanisms suggested for both DNA and RNA viruses are decreased transcription of viral genes and impaired synthesis of viral proteins by interfering with the host translational machinery. digitoxin also inhibits the viral release of HSV, acting on two different stages of the viral cycle. authors hypothesize that the inhibitory mechanism might be mediated via an interaction between Na,K,ATPase and other ion channels. authors found digoxin-induced alteration of signaling cascades affects the activity of factors known to regulate HIV-1 RNA splicing. kinase proteins SR, which have been shown to be modulated by digoxin, have anti-HIV activity in vitro and ex vivo in HIV-infected T cells from humans with inhibitory effects. the inhibition of the virus can be rescued by inhibitors of src signaling. a non-elucidated pathway is also involved in the inhibition of coronavirus."}
