{"summary": "HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and gastroenteritis worldwide. HBoV is classified in the family Parvoviridae, which includes small, non-envoloped, icosahedral viruses with 5.3 kb single-strand DNA genome containing three open reading frames. two cases of severe respiratory disease found a statistical association between HBoV1 and otherwise unexplained LRTIs. this suggests that HBoV1 infection, although mainly asymptomatic, has the potential to cause severe disease. HBoV DNA was also detected by real time PCR in 6 out 13 (46.2%) stool samples and 6 out 11 (54.5%) serum samples from inpatients. cough and abdominal pain were recorded in more inpatients with and without HBoV than inpatients without HBoV. HBoV1 was detected in patient NPAs throughout the course of the study with peak detection in autumn and winter. it was noticeable that HBoV appeared to co-circulate with RSVA. an extended study with a larger dataset would be required to confirm such a correlation. all 9 strains belonged to HBoV1, correlating with the results of subtype real time PCR. nine samples with real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value below 24 were chosen for genome sequencing. the most frequently detected viruses were HRV in 25 (61.0%), AdV in 14 (34.1%), RSVA in 13 (31.8%), hMPV and RSVB in 9 (22.0%) patients. the median age of HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative individuals of co-infection patients was 24 months (interquartile range 11\u201342 months) 1035 Abdominal pain 2 (10.5) 1 (2.4) 0.2332 Diarrhea 2 (10.5) 2 (4.8) 0.3770 Disease Severity (%) mild 10 (52.6) 17 (41.5) 0.4225 moderate 2 (10.5) 19 (46.3) 0.0073 severe 7 (36.8) 5 (12.2) 0.0332 HBoV viral load is associated with disease severity in children Absolute quantification of DNA by real time PCR revealed that the HBoV viral load in HBo load of symptomatic children, including outpatients and inpatients, was high. median viral load of asymptomatic children was low. HBoV viral loads were estimated in 47 HBoV-positive samples. median viral loads among mild, moderate and severe group were not significantly different. in co-infected inpatients median vial loads among the three groups were significantly different. HBoV viral load is associated with disease severity in co-infected patients. the 18 day old infant had HBoV viral load of 9.0104 copies/mL in the NPA with no HBoV detection in stool sample. the 18 day old infant had an HBoV viral load of 5.0109 copies/mL in the NPA with HBoV positive stool and serum samples. the 18 day old child had more severe clinical symptoms than the 12 day old child. the median age of HBoV-positive children was 24 months versus 3 months in HBoV-negative group. cough and abdominal pain were not significantly different between HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative groups. HBoV appeared to co-circulate with RSVA (Figure 1), which was the most frequently co-detected virus. however, an extended study with a larger dataset would be required to confirm such a correlation. nine samples with real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value below 24 were chosen for genome sequencing. nucleotide sequence of HBoV for each sample was PCR amplified, sequenced and analyzed. the median age of HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative individuals of co-infection patients was 24 months (interquartile range 11\u201342 months) and 30 months (interquartile range 24\u201339 months respectively) in the co-infected patient group there were fewer HBoV positive patients than HBoV negative patients with moderate disease. there were more HBoV positive than negative patients in the group with severe disease. HBoV viral load is associated with disease severity in children Absolute quantification of DNA by real time PCR revealed that the HBoV viral load in HBoV-positive children was highly variable. median viral load of healthy controls, outpatients and inpatients was 2.7103 copies/mL, 2106 copies/mL and 5.1106 copies/mL. median viral load of symptomatic children was not significantly higher than that in inpatients with HBoV co-infection with the HBoV viral loads were estimated in 47 HBoV-positive samples. the positive control (11010 copies/mL) provided in the kit was used to generate a standard curve. the differences in HBoV viral load between healthy controls and inpatients were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis H 2 test. patients with IOS value of 0\u20132 were classified as having mild disease. patients with IOS value of 3\u20135 were classified as having moderate disease. HBoV viral load was measured in 39 HBoV-positive inpatient samples. study in children under five in china suggests HBoV1 may be a causative virus for LRTI symptoms observed in patients. symptomatic children in our study had higher viral load than asymptomatic children, with HBoV1 viral load correlating with disease severity in co-infected children. HBoV has been cultured in differentiated human airway epithelial cells. isolation of HBoV from clinical samples has not been achieved in cell lines. recent studies have implied that HBoV DNA can exist episomally in infected human tissues. in co-infection, HBoV viral load was associated positively with disease severity. the percentage of RSVA co-detection with HBoV was not significantly higher than other infectious viruses in all disease severity groups. this is the first report of severe disease in an infant under 1 month of age. in all 554 patients were enrolled and their nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected within 3 days of admission to hospital. 11 patients had NPAs, stool and whole blood samples collected, 2 patients had NPAs and stool samples collected concurrently. clinical information was collected by trained staff and recorded. supernatant was removed and pellet resuspended in 200 L of Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium. plasma was isolated and kept at 70\u00b0C. 554 NPAs, 11 serum and 13 stool samples were used for reverse transcription. PCR was performed in a volume of 20 l using HBoV real time PCR kit. positive, negative and no-template controls included in each run. PCR was performed in a volume of 20 l using previously published primers. the conserved and variable regions of the HBoV1 genome were identified by aligning 13 HBoV1 sequences downloaded from Genbank. the primer pairs were specific for HBoV1, with no homology found to any other sequences in GenBank. 6 sequences of HBoV1, 3 HBoV2 sequences, 3 HBoV3 sequences and 2 HBoV4 sequences were downloaded from Genbank and used as the reference viruses in the construction of the tree. Statistical analysis was performed using the Epi Info software. study populations All patient samples used in this study were collected from patients who presented with respiratory symptoms to Shanghai Children's Hospital from October of 2009 through august of 2012. 11 patients had NPAs, stool and whole blood samples collected, 2 patients had NPAs and stool samples collected concurrently. 1.5 ml sterile saline (0.9%) was added into each tube of NPA and tubes centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 2 minutes. plasma was isolated and kept at 70\u00b0C. 554 NPAs, 11 serum and 13 stool samples were used for reverse transcription. PCR conditions were as per manufacturer's protocols and performed on GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (AB, Singapore) Positive and negative controls provided by the company were included in each test. PCR was performed in a volume of 20 l using previously published primers and probes for HBoV1-4 [25] PCR for complete genome sequence The complete genome of HBoV1 is 5299 nucleotide (nt) long; 5 primer pairs were designed to amplify 5 overlapping fragments. the conserved and variable regions of the HBoV1 genome were identified by aligning 13 HBoV1 sequences downloaded from Genbank. the phylogenetic tree of HBoV sequences was constructed using neighbor-joining by MEGA (5.0 version) software. 6 sequences of HBoV1, 3 HBoV2 sequences, 3 HBoV3 sequences and 2 HBoV4 sequences were downloaded from Genbank. Statistical analysis was performed using the Epi Info software (version 3.5, CDC, USA), and graphs were prepared using Prism Graphpad v5. Mentel-Haenszel, Kruskal-Wallis 2 or Fisher's exact 2 test were used to assess the significance."}
