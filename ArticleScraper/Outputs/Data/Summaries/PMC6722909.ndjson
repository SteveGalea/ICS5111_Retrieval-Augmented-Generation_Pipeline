{"summary": "infection with this retrovirus can lead to immunodeficiency in domestic cats [1,2,4] while the pathogenic potential in wild felids is less well known [3,5,6,7,8,9] due to a lack of proofreading capacity of the reverse transcriptase, there is a high error rate during replication and low replicative fidelity [10,11,12,13]. in south America, clades A, B, and E have been reported. clades B and E are predominant and clade E only being described in this geographic area so far. limited information on the FIV strains and clades is available for Asia. antibodies against the FIV transmembrane protein (TM) are the most reliable in terms of both their initial appearance post infection and their duration of detection in the blood. many POCT and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) used in diagnostic laboratories use FIV-TM as the capture antigen, but capsid protein has also been added to some tests. the aim of this study was to systematically test samples sent to our laboratory over two decades (1998\u20132019) using FIV-TM ELISA as well as WB, which is the gold standard for FIV testing. a total of 1194 samples, including 536 samples from FIV-infected cats, were available for this study. horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-cat immunoglobulin G (H+L) conjugate was used as a conjugate. the plate was then incubated for one hour at 37 \u00b0C and washed three times. samples that yielded only one band, either p24 or p15, were judged as inconclusive. a few ELISA false-negative samples with too little volume for combined POCT and RT-PCR analyses were further analyzed by RT-PCR. nucleic acid samples were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. the final reaction volume of 25 L contained 800 nM of each primer (FIV551f/FIV571r), 160 nM of the fluorogenic probe (FIV581p), 12.5 L 2 RT qPCR Mastermix. reaction mix underwent reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min. denaturation and activation for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. final reaction volume was 25 L in both rounds. RT-PCR with PlatinumR Taq Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific and 0.31 L (40 U/L) RNasinR Plus (Promega) were used in the first round. 2.5 L 10 buffer, 1.5 L MgCl2, 1.25 L (5 U/L) Taq DNA Polymerase and 0.5 L dNTPs were used in the second round. the data were compiled in Microsoft Excel 2016 and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 (Version 8.1.0; GraphPad Prism Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) the frequencies were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test (pF). the ages of the cats in different groups were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test (pMWU). a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-cat immunoglobulin G conjugate was used as a conjugate and was diluted 1:1000. a positive (serum from a FIV-positive cat) was considered positive if two bands with a molecular weight of 15,000 (p15) and 24,000 (p24) were recognizable on the blotting strip. ELISA-negative and WB-positive samples were tested using two different points-of-care tests. the kit materials and samples were allowed to warm to room temperature before performing the test. a few ELISA false-negative samples with too little volume for combined POCT and RT-PCR analyses were further analyzed by RT-PCR. negative controls consisting of 100 or 140 L of phosphate buffered saline were prepared with each extraction batch to monitor cross-contamination. final reaction volume of 25 L contained 800 nM of each primer (FIV551f/FIV571r), 160 nM of the fluorogenic probe (FIV581p), 12.5 L 2 RT qPCR Mastermix and 0.125 L of a master mix containing 6.25 U Euroscript reverse transcriptase. reaction mix underwent reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min, denaturation and activation for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. a seminested RT-PCR was performed that amplified a 470 bp-long sequence from the FIV clade A and B gag gene. 1.5 L MgCl2, 1.25 L (5 U/L) Taq DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.5 L dNTPs (ThermoFisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) were used in the second round. a reverse transcription step was performed for 30 min at 55 \u00b0C, followed by the first round of PCR. data were compiled in Microsoft Excel 2016 and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 (Version 8.1.0; GraphPad Prism Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) the frequencies were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test (pF). the ages of the cats in different groups were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test (pMWU). p-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. mc 289 64/53 172 155 3 14 - f 104 44/26 34 24 0 10 - fs 127 67/22 38 31 1 6 - unk 482 171/110 201 157 19 25 Age (y) - 6 months 2 46 23/12 11 6 1 4 - 6 months to 2 y 113 49/25 39 29 0 10 - 2 to 6 y 210 70/48 92 74 4 14 - 6 the results from the FIV WB analyses were used as the gold standard for the determination of FIV status in cats. of the 1194 tested samples, 536 were FIV WB-positive and 411 were FIV WB-negative. 247 had inconclusive results because they produced only one band in WB. information about the sex was available for 240 cats. there were 65 intact male (27%), 64 neutered male (27%), 44 intact female (18%), and 67 spayed female cats (28%). the sex was available for 240 cats. 3% of the WB-negative samples (11/411) were false-positive according to TM ELISA. of the 536 samples that were FIV WB-positive, 441 (82%) were also TM ELISA-positive and 25 (5%) revealed an ambiguous result.

pc = positive control; CH = Switzerland, DE = Germany. the results of our study demonstrate an increased percentage of cats in central Europe that tested FIV-positive by WB. only 2% of the 194 FIV WB-positive samples were negative according to the TM ELISA [53] compared to 70 out of 536 FIV WB-positive samples (13%) collected from august 1998 to February 2019. more than half of cats with discordant results had either presented to Swiss veterinarians or were represented by samples sent to a Swiss laboratory before they were sent for confirmation to our laboratory. a few of these cats with an FIV infection that was unrecognized by FIV-TM ELISA might have lived abroad. TM is the immunodominant epitope in FIV that induces the earliest and strongest antibody response in cats experimentally infected with FIV [53,62,63,71,72] the preferred genetic location for recombination is in the envelope (env) gene, which also encodes TM [10,25,61,87] TM is encoded in the variable env gene and is mainly responsible for the host antibody response [61,62,63]. TM is encoded in the variable env gene and is mainly responsible for the host antibody response [61,62,63,64]. if present, antibodies to these epitopes, if present, should be more consistently recognized. SNAPTM POCT-positive cat was negative according to the WITNESSR POCT test. two additional FIV WB-positive samples were weakly positive according to RT-PCR. the presence of maternal antibodies was not fully excludable. all RT-PCR-positive samples showed very low viral loads that were too low for sequencing. the SNAPTM POCT test seemed to have recognized more of the discordant samples than the WITNESSR POCT test. however, the sensitivity of the different tests could have played a role. negative sample was just at the cut-off point for a negative result (10%) for FIV-TM ELISA (9.9%) the decreased sensitivity of FIV-TM ELISA described over the last twenty years was found based on a comparison with a study from 1995 [53]. the discordant samples in our study could have been falsely WB-positive. we have chosen and used WB as the gold standard for detecting FIV infection. the method is laborious, expensive and time-consuming. a POCT (SNAPTM FIV/FeLV Combo) using additional FIV antigens besides the immunodominant TM antigen did not recognize all the presumptively FIV-positive cats. however, the inability to recognize an increasing number of FIV-infected cats poses a serious problem."}
