{"summary": "DNA vaccines are considered to be inexpensive, stable, relatively safe compared to attenuated viral vaccines [1], [2], [3], [4] and flexible to integrate genes encoding antigens and immunostimulatory sequences. however, it usually failed in inducing local immunity at mucosal sites where tremendous infectious agents enter the body. the single DNA vaccine (pGJA-P/VAX included) showed low efficacy via i.n. administration [15], [16], possibly attributed to poor antigen delivery. nanoparticles (NPs) may provide an ideal solution to alleviate problems associated with the nasal delivery of DNA vaccines. cationic liposomes are extremely toxic to phagocytic cells. mucosal immunization with liposomes seems to be limited and especially dependent on co-administration of other co-stimulants. these results inspired us whether a new system comprised of the AL and CS/DNA could render the transfection efficiency. dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and 1, 2-Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) were purchased from Lipoid. Plasmid pGJA-P/VAX and recombination proteins PAc were provided by Prof. Mingwen Fan. CS/DNA NPs were prepared by adding an equal volume of the diluted CS solution to a DNA (1000 g/ml) solution at different N/P ratios. the pH values of the CS-based NPs were adjusted to 7.4, 7.1, 6.8 or 6.4 for characterization. s were incubated with DNase I in reaction buffer at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. agarose gel containing 1 g/ml ethidium bromide in TAE buffer. DNA was detected under UV light using the Gel Documentation System. NPs containing plasmid pcDNA3.0-Rluc were prepared 30 min before transfection of cells. the medium was removed and replaced with 500 l DMEM (with 10% FBS) the cells were further incubated for 48 h, and harvested by using trypsin solution. Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well Transwell (2 105 per insert) and maintained for 7 days in supplemented DMEM. the integrity of the monolayer was assayed by measuring the TEER using an electrode connected to EVOM2. each animal was immunized with 25 g plasmid pGJA-P/VAX in HEPES (pH 7.4) via i.m. pathway. a secondary immunization was performed after 2 weeks with the same dose of formulations and operating procedures. each well of the 96-well plates was coated with purified 10 g/ml protein PAc in a 0.1 M, pH 9.5 carbonate buffer at 4\u00b0C. plates were blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, then washed five times with the PBST. in vivo fluorescence imaging the NIRF dye Cy5.5 was modified to the amino group of CS for real-time imaging in vivo. the final results were counted according to the standard curve. phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and 1, 2-Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) were purchased from Lipoid. Plasmid pGJA-P/VAX and recombination proteins PAc were provided by Prof. Mingwen Fan. NPs were diluted with PBS buffer at pH 7.4, 7.1, 6.8, 6.4, and stabilized at room temperature for 30 min prior to the measurement. the release of pGJA-P/VAX from AL/CS/DNA in PBS was studied at different pH (7.4 or 6.4) in a shaker at 100 rpm and 37\u00b0C. 0.8% agarose gel containing 1 g/ml ethidium bromide in TAE buffer. DNA was detected under UV light using the Gel Documentation System. 400 l transfection medium (pH 6.4) containing CS/Luc or AL/CS/Luc at a concentration of 1 g DNA/well. after 5 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with 500 l DMEM (with 10% FBS) the cells were further incubated for 48 h, and harvested by using trypsin solution. the integrity of the monolayer was assayed by measuring the TEER. Caco-2 cells were washed once with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, pH 6.4) and equilibrated in HBSS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. all experiments were repeated at least three times. each animal was inoculated with 25 g plasmid pGJA-P/VAX in small drops. a secondary immunization was performed after 2 weeks. each well of the 96-well plates was coated with purified 10 g/ml protein PAc in a 0.1 M, pH 9.5 carbonate buffer at 4\u00b0C. plates were blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, then washed five times with PBST. nu/nu mice were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to the administration of 10 l AL/Cy5.5-CS/DNA NPs. mice were put back in cages to recover from anesthesia. JA-P/VAX from the CS/DNA was observed at the N/P ratio of 3. less DNA was retarded compared with higher N/P ratio NPs. CS/DNA was prepared at the N/P ratio of 7 in the subsequent experiments. lane 8: PEI/DNA+DNase I (200 U/ml); lane 9: PEI/DNA. Table 1. Physicochemical characteristics of CS/DNA and AL/CS/DNA. PEI/DNA was also shown to have high DNA loading and high resistance against DNase. transfection assay performed to confirm optimal N/P ratio and lipid/DNA ratio, which might contribute to high expression of DNA vaccine. CS/DNA, AL/CS/DNA and PEI/DNA NPs were used as the positive control. PEI/Luc NPs at N/P ratio of 10 were used as the positive control. physicochemical properties of NPs influence stability, mucosal adsorption and transport. studies on the surface morphology of the prepared NPs with TEM indicated that the CS/DNA was irregular shape. the AL/CS/DNA was almost spherical at pH 6.4 and AL acted as a core. when pH increased to 7.4, the disintegration of the AL/CS/DNA was observed. fluorescence of the two NPs in the cavity exceeded 40% of total fluorescence after i.n. administration within 2 h. but in comparison to the CS/DNA, a more powerful ability in prolonging the nasal residence time was verified on the AL/CS/DNA. FITC modification on CS did not interfere with DNA entrapping capacity and release (Table 1 and Fig. S1). the AL/FITC-CS/DNA was found to penetrate into the deep mucosa layer (up to 17.6 m) within 2 h. the fluorescence intensity increased to the peak value in the depth of 8.8 m. TEER decrease on Caco-2 cell monolayer is a measure for mucosal epithelial permeability. the percentage of cells that internalized FITC-labeled NPs and their fluorescence intensity were enhanced notably (p0.01) by incorporating AL. female Balb/c mice were divided into five groups (n = 10) and vaccinated with indicated formulations via i.n. or i.m. route. a significant and lasting salivary anti-PAc SIgA antibody response was elicited by i.n. administration of the AL/CS/DNA. no obvious specific IgG response was observed in the PBS group (i.n.), naked DNA (i.n.) group or the CS/DNA (i.n.) group. specific IgG response of the AL/CS/DNA (i.n.) group presented statistical significance only at week 4 (p0.01) compared with the CS/DNA (i.n.) group. DNA Loading and Nuclease Degradation Assay Gel electrophoresis has been widely used to monitor the affinity capability of DNA adsorbed on test NPs. pGJA-P/VAX was completely compacted by CS as the N/P ratio reached 7. pGJA-p/VAX+DNase I (50 U/ml); lane 4: AL/CS/DNA; lane 5: AL/CS/DNA+DNase I (100 U/ml); lane 7: AL/CS/DNA+DNase I (200 U/ml); lane 8: PEI/DNA+DNase I (200 U/ml); lane 9: PEI/DNA. in vitro transfection assay, transfection efficiency of the CS/Luc was determined by luciferase reporter enzymes and GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) the optimal N/P ratio was from 71 to 101, which agreed with the previous results [32]. transfection images of CS/GFP and AL/CS/GFP with different N/P ratios and lipid/DNA ratios were shown in Fig. 2C. CS/DNA, AL/CS/DNA and PEI/DNA NPs were used as the positive control. the size and zeta potential of the CS/DNA and AL/CS/DNA did not change significantly. a pH-mediated DNA release from the AL/CS/DNA was verified in Fig. 3F. a pH-mediated DNA release from the AL/CS/DNA was verified. the nasal residence time of Cy5.5-CS/DNA and AL/Cy5.5-CS/DNA was monitored with IVIS spectrum imaging system as in Fig. 4A. fluorescence of the two NPs in the cavity exceeded 40% of total fluorescence after i.n. administration within 2 h. but a more powerful ability in prolonging the nasal residence time was verified on the AL/CS/DNA. FITC-CS/DNA and AL/FITC-CS/DNA were administrated into rat nasal mucosa for 2 h. FITC modification on CS did not interfere with DNA entrapping capacity and release. FITC-CS/DNA treated for 2 h. both images were from the apical side to depth of 17.6 m beneath mucosa. blue arrow represents AL/FITC-CS/DNA; red arrow represents FITC-CS/DNA. female Balb/c mice were divided into five groups (n = 10) and vaccinated with indicated formulations via i.n. or i.m. route. a significant and lasting salivary anti-PAc SIgA antibody response was elicited by i.n. administration of the AL/CS/DNA. anti-PAc serum IgG levels (ng/ml); (B) Specific anti-PAc serum IgG levels (g/ml). samples were collected at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 compared with the AL/CS/DNA (i.n.) group. as the concentration reached 45 g/ml, the cell viability of the PEI/DNA was less than 20%. TEM results revealed that the AL/CS/DNA had a relatively spherical shape and an AL core at pH 6.4. CS/DNA and CS/AL were bridged by CS chains in the AL/CS/DNA NPs. hydrogen bonding might be driving force for CS/DNA binding and CS/AL binding. hydrogen bonding might be driving force for CS/DNA binding. DOPE (one component of AL) were reported to promote membrane destabilization. the PG lipids were proved to have nucleus-fusogenic ability. the nasal mucosal pH is approximately 5.5\u20136.5 [42] globular GC (glyco chitosan) NPs showed an enhanced distribution in cells compared with the irregular GC polymers. spherical AL/CS/DNA can penetrate the mucus gels through the pores between mucin fibers to contact mucosal epithelia. CS/DNA was gradually removed by mucociliary clearance. a pathway of polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct targeting of APCs is successful. a new pathway of polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct targeting of APCs is successful. a new pathway of polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct targeting of APCs is successful.
