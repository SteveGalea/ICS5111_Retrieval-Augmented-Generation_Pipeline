{"summary": "renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in numerous physiological functions that regulate vasoconstriction, fluid volume regulation, cardiac output, cell growth, and vascular wall integrity. production of angiotensin peptides is first initiated by the synthesis and processing of preprorenin in juxtaglomerular cells neighboring the renal glomerulus with subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide. angiotensin-1\u20137 [ANG (1\u20137) exerts its action through a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Mas. the effects of ANG (1\u20137)/Mas activation are generally considered counter to those of ANG II (46) several seminal review articles have highlighted the unique signal transduction mechanisms of ANG II in the cardiovascular system. this review aims to build upon and expand previous reports and highlights the recently explored novel mechanisms by which ANG II influences physiology and pathophysiology. ANG II signal topics not covered in this article Topics Reference Nos. Adrenal hormone secretion 755 Angiogenesis 1150 AT1R agonistic autoantibodies 1169 Autoimmune diseases 138 Cancer/malignancies 877 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 959 Diabetic retinopathy 1148 Erectile dysfunction 291 Gastrointestinal system 270 Gender differences 1008 Hematopoiesis. ANG III is produced from ANG II by enzymatic cleavage by an aminopeptidase. ANG IV is cleaved from ANG III by another aminopeptidase. ANG (1\u201312) has been reported to serve as an upstream renin-independent precursor peptide for ANG I and ANG II (15, 734) ANG (1\u20137) has been reported to elicit its effects through the GPCR Mas receptor. alamandine also promotes antihypertensive effects through the Mas-related GPCR member D, MrgD, to produce nitric oxide (NO). ANG III exerts its direct effects via AT2R (767) ANG I is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to ANG II. ANG II can further diverge into either ANG (1\u20137) through ACE2 or ANG III through an aminopeptidase. ANG III can also form alamandine which binds to the AT4R. ANG II and ANG (1\u20137) concentrations in healthy volunteers were reported to be 535 fmol/ml. physiological plasma and kidney concentrations of ANG II were reported to be 50 fmol/ml and 160 fmol/g in rats. ANG II infusion is also expected to increase ANG II metabolites in plasma and tissue. Rag1/ mice showed significant reduction in blood pressure in response to chronic ANG II infusion (490 ngmin1kg1) for 2 wk compared with control C57BL/6 mice (348). inhibition of ANG II-induced hypertension in mice have been confirmed by several distinct institutions (432, 829, 1074, 1095) ANG (1\u20137) is formed by the catalytic action of ACE2 on ANG II. ANG III is produced from ANG II by enzymatic cleavage by an aminopeptidase. ANG IV is cleaved from ANG III by another aminopeptidase. evidence suggests ANG (1\u20139) exerts direct actions counterregulate ANG II. ANG (1\u20137) has been reported to elicit its effects through the GPCR Mas receptor. ANG III binds and activates the classical angiotensin receptors AT1R and AT2R (682). ANG (1\u20139) exerts its direct effects via AT2R (767) ANG IV activation of AT4R causes vasorelaxation in renal and cerebral vascular beds, stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), enhances protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts. ANG II can further diverge into either ANG (1\u20137) through ACE2 or ANG III through an aminopeptidase. rapid conversion of ANG II to ANG III and ANG (1\u20137) in culture medium (61) will complicate the interpretation. systemic ANG II infusion via osmotic mini-pump may increase the circulating levels of ANG II. metabolites including ANG (1\u20137), ANG III, and ANG IV have been used without rigorous validations. the specificity and selectivity of the antibodies targeting the receptors remain hotly debated (69, 259, 351, 377) AT1R is present in various tissues, including vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, heart, brain, kidney, adrenal gland, and adipose tissue. the AT1R is a seven-transmembrane (TM) protein belonging to the GPCR superfamily. ANG II-dependent activation of AT1R is transient and results in receptor internalization upon COOH-terminal phosphorylation by PKC and GPCR kinases. the components of AT1R internalization include GTP hydrolysis-mediated dynamin fission of clathrin-coated vesicles. AT1R activity and protein levels are affected by posttranslational modification. evidence suggests tissue transglutaminase-mediated modification of AT1R contributes to AT1R autoantibody production and hypertension associated with preeclampsia. second messenger signaling includes inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) the response may differ, such as in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) where these components typically regulate contraction through Gq/11 Ca2+-sensitive myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation. newly identified protein kinases in ANG II signaling Kinase Substrates Function Reference Nos.

STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase; NKCC1, NaCl cotransporter; WNK, with no lysine kinase. tyrosine kinase likely phosphorylates ADAM17 at Tyr702 upon ANG II stimulation leading to ADAM17 activation in VSMCs. ANG II is also known to transactivate the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) receptor (370) and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-IR) receptor (246) in VSMCs. the ANG II-induced IGF-IR transactivation appears to be required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p70S6K activation. ANG II is believed to increase ROS production via the Nox family proteins by increasing their expression as well as the catalytic activity (308) in rat aortic VSMCs, ANG II appears to increase superoxide via Nox1 leading to both superoxide and H2O2 production. AP-1 and c-Jun activation are critical for induction of Nox1, Nox4, p67phox, p47phox, and p22phox in human induced intracellular Ca2+ elevation, superoxide production, and hypertension were attenuated in mice deficient in G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (693) nox2 appears to mediate ANG II-induced superoxide production in cytosol and mitochondrial fractions in cultured aortic endothelial cells. ANG II also activates Nox5 via Ca2+ and calmodulin leading to growth and inflammatory responses in human microvascular endothelial cells a study in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells utilizing the mutant AT1R-DRY/AAY or a biased agonist Sar1, Ire4, Ile8-ANG II (SII) suggest distinct active confirmations of the AT1R. the mutant AT1R induces G protein-independent, but -arrestin 2-dependent ERK activation (1132). accelerated receptor internalization is due to the differences in plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion (1019) this is due to the differences in plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion (1019) this is due to the differences in plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion (1019) both AT1AR and AT1BR appear mechanosensitive. RGS5 appears to inhibit mechano-activated AT1R in VSMCs. meric form with other GPCRs includes the AT2R, 1D adrenergic receptor, 1 adrenergic receptor, 2 adrenergic receptor, bradykinin receptor B2, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), dopamine receptor D1, endothelin B receptor, Mas, prostaglandin F receptor, and P2Y purinergic receptor 6. previously identified AT1R interacting proteins include ca2+/calmodulin, JAK2, phospholipase C (PLC)-1, AT1 receptor associated protein (ATRAP), type 1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ARAP1) and GEF-like protein (GLP) the list of AT1R interacting proteins has now been expanded to include filamin A, a cross-linking signal transducer (1055), tubulin (1258), Coatomer subunit (-COP) (1275) and GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (182). AT1R signaling mechanisms are still speculative compared to those of AT1R. AT2R stimulates MAPK phophatase1 (MKP-1) and SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) resulting in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation throughout the cell with SHP-1 requiring Gs for activation. compound 21 (C21) causes natriuresis, lowers blood pressure, and protects against ANG II-induced hypertension in rats. AT2R-interacting protein family (759) has been observed to promote macrophage polarization and an anti-inflammatory environment in adipose tissue in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet (443) studies suggest that AT2R signals primarily via noncanonical, G protein- and -arrestin-independent pathways (834) the crystal structure of human AT2R with ligands has recently been reported. the data suggest an active-like conformation, but with the helix VIII preventing recruitment of G proteins or -arrestins. ANG (1\u20137) does not stimulate these G proteins via Mas. neuropeptide FF activates Gq and G12 in Mas-expressing cells. ANG (1\u20137) mediates vasodilation via AT2R in the presence of AT1R blocker (1102) KO mice show no reduction in mean arterial blood pressure in response to a bolus injection of ANG (1\u20137) (1044). ANG II induces PRR expression in the collecting duct thereby increasing renin activity. ANG II induces PRR expression in the collecting duct. transgenic rats overexpressing human PRR ubiquitously are normotensive. transgenic rats with smooth muscle specific PRR overexpression are hypertensive at 6 mo of age, which could be due to intra-adrenal ANG II-induced aldosterone generation. ANG II-dependent activation of AT1R is transient and results in receptor internalization upon COOH-terminal phosphorylation by PKC and GPCR kinases (GRK2 and GRK5). ANG II-dependent activation of AT1R is transient. PT hydrolysis-mediated dynamin fission of clathrin-coated vesicles and -arrestin-dependent mechanisms can vary depending on AT1R dimer composition. -arrestin 2, adaptor protein complex 2 1 subunit, clathrin, FCH domain only 2, and intersectin 2, wheras it exhibits sustained interaction with endosomal markers, Rab5 and Rab7. loop creates a neo-epitope that encourages production of an autoantibody by the adaptive immune system that can activate the receptor (596) the subsequent increased abundance of AT1R on the cell surface likely contributes to hypertension as well. the rodent AT1Rs are products of two separate genes and share substantial sequence homology. tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases appear to be activated by ANG II via AT1R or through AT1R. tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases appear to be activated by ANG II via AT1R or presumably through AT1R. synthesis 561 AMPK (1) ACC Endothelial protection, limit Nox2 induction and ROS 931 AMPK (2) AP2, ACC AAA protection, limit VSMC MMP2 induction 1117 BCR PPAR inhibition and NF-B activation 20 DAPK Unstudied Cardiac myocyte hypertrophya 76 Unstudied Renal NF-B activation and inflammationa 23 Unstudied VSMC ROS production, migration, and proliferationa bActivation of the kinase has been predicted in VSMCs (600, 1061) cPredicted substrate. dFunction is predicted. dFunction is predicted in VSMCs. ADAM17 cleaves heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (EGFR) transactivation by ANG II. ANG II-induced IGF-IR transactivation appears to be required for EGFR transactivation. ylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p70S6K activation, but not for ERK activation (1230). IGF-IR partially mediates ROS production by ANG II leading to p38MAPK and ERK5 activation in VSMCs (1058). ANG II appears to increase superoxide via Nox1 leading to both superoxide and H2O2 production. nox4 maintains basal H2O2 production (231). AP-1 and c-Jun activation critical for induction of Nox1, Nox4, p67phox, p47phox, and p22phox in human aortic VSMC (644) distinct Nox isoforms are involved in ANG II-induced ROS production and downstream function in given cell types. however, the relation between ANG II signaling and Nox3, Duox1 and Duox2 remains unclear. complexity and controversy surrounding nox/ROS signaling via AT1R have also been reviewed recently. functional selectivity and positions 1, 4, and 8 of ANG II were studied in HEK293 cells. position 8 appears critical for Gq activation, while position 8 mutations also reduce G12 activation. biased agonism also affects for the receptor fate. TRV120027 is a -arrestin biased AT1R ligand. it promotes -arrestin 2 recruitment to AT1R. but fails to elicit G protein coupling and prevents ANG II-induced elevation in mean arterial pressure. studies suggest both benefit and harm of -arrestin signals. basic ANG II signaling involves Gq-mediated Nox, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC)- signaling. PKC- and G12/13-induced RhoA elicits downstream MLC-mediated contraction. PLC stimulates IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and subsequent MLCK activation. dimerization with AT2R, endothelin B receptor, and Mas is considered inhibitory. dimerization with 1 adrenergic receptor, 2 adrenergic receptor, bradykinin receptor B2, CCR2, prostaglandin F receptor, and P2Y purinergic receptor 6 are considered stimulatory. the mechanisms by which the heterodimers function are diverse. ca2+/calmodulin also interacts with third intracellular loop of AT1R. attenuates AT1R-mediated vascular senescence via calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. in/AT1R interaction is dependent on Lys308 in the cytoplasmic domain of AT1R. GABARAP is involved in GABAA receptor trafficking through microtubule networks. AT1R associates with EGFR (774) and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) receptor. AT1R is a seven-transmembrane (TM) protein belonging to the GPCR superfamily. the 359 amino acid (41 kDa) AT1R contains several contact sites for ANG II binding. ANG II is mediated through Phe8(ANG II)/His256(AT1R) and Tyr4(ANG II)/Asn111(AT1R) ANG II-dependent activation of AT1R is transient and results in receptor internalization upon COOH-terminal phosphorylation by PKC and GPCR kinases (GRK2 and GRK5) components of AT1R internalization include GTP hydrolysis-mediated dynamin fission of clathrin-coated vesicles and -arrestin-dependent mechanisms. evidence suggests tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated modification of AT1R contributes to AT1R autoantibody production and hypertension associated with preeclampsia. posttranslational modification of Q187 creates a neo-epitope that encourages production of an autoantibody by the adaptive immune system. sphosphate, diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to activation of downstream effectors, phospholipases C, A, and D. Depending on the tissue in which these signals are activated, the response may differ, such as in VSMCs. newly identified protein kinases in ANG II signaling Kinase Substrates Function Reference Nos.

IGF-IR transactivation is reported to mediate ERK activation (708), vascular hypertrophy, and fibrosis. ANG II-induced IGF-IR transactivation appears to be required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p70S6K activation, but not for ERK activation (1230) ANG II is believed to increase ROS production via the Nox family proteins by increasing their expression as well as the catalytic activity (308) in rat aortic VSMCs, ANG II appears to increase superoxide via Nox1 leading to both superoxide and H2O2 production. nox2 appears to mediate ANG II-induced superoxide production in cytosol and mitochondrial fractions in cultured aortic endothelial cells. ANG II also activates Nox5 via Ca2+ and calmodulin leading to growth and inflammatory responses in human microvascular endothelial cells. the relationship between ANG II signaling and nox3 and duox2 remains unclear. the mutant AT1R or SII via wild-type AT1R induces G protein-independent, but -arrestin 2-dependent ERK activation (1132). a more sensitive G protein assay via bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) demonstrated Gq and Gi activation by SII, whereas the mode of the activation appears distinct from those by ANG II. this novel information has been translated to create a -arrestin-biased AT1R agonist to potentially treat heart failure and hypertension. TRV120027, which is a -arrestin biased AT1R ligand, promotes -arrestin 2 recruitment to AT1R but fails to elicit G protein coupling. RGS5 appears to inhibit mechano-activated AT1R in VSMCs (390). basic ANG II signaling involves Gq-mediated Nox, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC)- signaling. ANG II promotes ER stress and downstream inflammatory activation through transforming growth factor (TGF)- signaling. 2 adrenergic receptor, bradykinin receptor B2, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), dopamine receptor D1, endothelin B receptor, Mas, prostaglandin F receptor, and P2Y purinergic receptor 6 are considered stimulatory. the mechanisms by which the heterodimers function are diverse. ase C (PLC)-1, AT1 receptor associated protein (ATRAP), type 1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ARAP1) and GEF-like protein (GLP) are known to interact with ca2+/calmodulin, JAK2 and PLC-1. ca2+/calmodulin also interacts with third intracellular loop of AT1R. the list of AT1R interacting proteins has now been expanded to include filamin A, a cross-linking signal transducer (1055), tubulin (1258), Coatomer subunit (-COP) (1275) and GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (182). AT2R stimulates MAPK phophatase1 (MKP-1) and SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) resulting in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation throughout the cell. inhibition of ERK MAPK by AT2R appears to induce myoblast differentiation and potentiate skeletal muscle regeneration providing new therapeutic target in muscle wasting disorders (1211) AT2R-interacting protein family (759) has been observed to promote macrophage polarization and an anti-inflammatory environment in adipose tissue in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet (443), and to contribute to normal brain function (872). ATIP can also prevent vascular remodeling and ANG II-dependent vascular senescence, as well as suppress the growth of various forms of tumors (699, 873). studies suggest AT2R signals primarily via noncanonical, G protein- and -arrestin-independent pathways (834) the crystal structure of human AT2R with ligands has recently been reported. the data suggest an active-like conformation, but with the helix VIII preventing recruitment of G proteins or -arrestins. ANG (1\u20137) mediates vasodilation via AT2R in the presence of AT1R blocker (1102) this link has been expanded in the apolipoprotein E apoE/ mouse model of atherosclerosis and isolated aorta with pharmacological interventions (820). ANG II induces PRR expression in the collecting duct thereby increasing renin activity and contributing to local ANG II generation. ANG II induces PRR expression in the collecting duct and mediates the ANG II-induced PRR. transgenic rats overexpressing human PRR ubiquitously are normotensive, but show progressive development of nephropathy (454) transgenic rats with smooth muscle specific PRR overexpression are hypertensive at 6 mo of age, which could be due to intra-adrenal ANG II-induced aldosterone generation. meanwhile, brain PRR is hypothesized to regulate ANG II-dependent hypertensive responses (576, 1179) genetically modified rodents have enabled us to obtain fundamental new knowledge in signaling mechanisms, physiology, and pathophysiology of the ANG II receptors. Wnt/-catenin pathway is activated when a Wnt ligand binds to the seven-transmembrane Frizzled (Fz or Fzd) receptor and its coreceptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). the Wnt/-catenin pathway has also been implicated in ANG II-related renal injury and renal fibrosis (1270) in immortalized mouse podocytes, ANG II induces Wnt1 expression, -catenin nuclear translocation, and TCF reporter transcription. ca2+/calmodulin kinase II and CREB appear to mediate induction of Wnt1 mRNA. bioinformatics suggests the presence of a conserved TCF/LEF binding site in the promoter of AGT, renin, ACE, AT1R, and AT2R. a few manuscripts implicate the Wnt/-catenin pathway in vascular pathophysiology. ANG II rapidly stimulates -catenin nuclear accumulation. ANG II infusion in mice causes macrophage-dependent complement c1q production. but hypertension induced by ANG II is unaltered in mice with VSMC -catenin deletion. notch pathway is crucial in several developmental processes. ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy was enhanced in Notch3/ mice. the kidney also shows enhanced tubular dilation and fibrosis. notch3 is necessary for end organ adaptation in hypertension. notch1 appears to contribute to ANG II plus TGF-dependent EMT via Snail induction in human tubular epithelial cells. negative data about notch and kidney fibrosis by ANG II have also been reported (548) notch signaling has also been implicated in development and expression of renin progenitor cells in both zebrafish and mouse. in a mouse model of preeclampsia with ANG II infusion, hypertension is inhibited with restored IL-6 upregulation in NLRP3/ but not in ASC/ mice (957). further investigation suggests additional involvement of mitochondrial ROS generation by macrophages in the NLRP3 pathway (1079). ANG II induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to mitochondrial ROS generation. mitochondrial cyclophilin D mediates ANG II-induced mitochondrial superoxide production in ECs and in mouse aorta. mitochondrial targeted antioxidant peptide or genetic mitochondrial catalase transgene attenuates mitochondrial oxidative damage and cardiac hypertrophy. mitochondrial quality control is regulated through a fission and fusion cycle to replace dysfunctional mitochondria. ANG II induces mitochondrial fission/fragmentation via phosphorylation in VSMCs and neuroblastoma cells. RNA silencing of Drp1 attenuates ANG II-induced ERK activation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 induction in VSMCs. mdivi1 also attenuates ANG II-induced VSMC migration and proliferation (590) PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2 upon ER stress resulting in the inhibition of most cap-dependent translation. ER stress and UPR have been shown to play causative roles in various ANG II-induced pathologies. ANG II-induced ER stress exists downstream of the ADAM17/EGFR transactivation cascade (1034, 1035) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) induction (464), and upstream of cardiac (465) and renal TGF- induction (1118), vascular apoptotic pathway (989), and brain SFO NF-B activation (1218). membrane rafts and caveolae can fuse, cluster, and internalize. both can regulate surface expression of signaling domains (161, 799) caveolae can serve as both transport vesicles and signaling platforms. discovery prompted investigation into relationship between receptors and these organelles. relationship between ANG II receptor and caveolae-based signaling adds layer of cellular regulation. introduction of the Cav1 scaffolding domain peptide attenuates ANG II signaling responses involving Ca2+ flux and the PI3K/Akt pathway. loss of caveolae integrity with Cav1 siRNA treatment disturbs compartmentalization of these elements on the plasma membrane. EGFR and ADAM17, a metalloprotease that generates mature ligands for EGFR, are also localized in Cav1-containing membrane fractions in VSMCs. depletion of Cav1 via siRNA blocks signaling pathways involving modification of nephrin. global Cav1 silencing prevents ANG II-induced vascular hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) induction (288). ANG II-dependent formation of AAA is also prevented in these Cav1 knockout mice. microparticles derived from human T lymphocytes show protective effects against ANG II-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction. microparticle injection reverses this increase as well as promotes increased NO production. ANG II infusion in apoE/ mice enhances production of EC-derived microparticles. ANG II stimulates procoagulant microparticle release from human mononuclear cells that is dependent upon AT2R-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. high glucose plus ANG II combination enhances production of extracellular vesicles (mixture of microparticles and exosomes) autophagy and mitophagy Autophagy is a critical mechanism needed to maintain cell and organ homeostasis through the stimulation of catabolism. it is initiated by formation of a double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome, which is responsible for degrading organelles and large protein aggregates. ANG II-enhanced autophagy is associated with induction of beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and autophagy protein 9A (Atg9A), proteins essential for autophagosome formation (401, 1122). ANG II-enhanced autophagy and hypertrophic responses are associated with downregulation of miR-30 and miR-34a. autophagy protein 5 (Atg5) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase necessary for formation of autophagosomes and autophagy. reduction in macrophage autophagy and mitophagy is associated with enhancement of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, ROS production, and NF-B activation. adiponectin induces macrophage autophagy, thereby inhibiting ANG II-induced inflammatory responses and cardiac fibrosis in mice intracellular/intracrine ANG II binds to the AT1R expressed in the nuclear membrane causing growth promoting signal transduction. there is controversy over whether intracellular ANG II and its receptors are internalized or originate within the cells they affect. stone deacetylases (HDACs) deacetylate histones, condense chromatin, and thereby repress transcription. in VSMCs, ANG II induces PKC/PKD1-dependent class IIa HDAC5 phosphorylation and nuclear export, leading to MEF2 activation and protein synthesis. ANG II increases histone lysine acetylation on the IL-6 promoter. IL-6 transcriptional activity is attenuated by ERK-phosphorylation site deficient mutants of CBP/p300 and SRC-1. cyclophilin A stimulates its secretion in VSMCs. prolonged lysine acetylation of PGC-1 reduces SIRT1 expression in VSMCs. ANG II stimulation also downregulates SIRT3 mRNA in cultured epithelial cells. a recent study further demonstrated that ANG II causes SIRT3 S-glutathionylation. SUMOylation SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins conjugates to lysine residues in target proteins. ANG II upregulates ATF3 and SUMO1 in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. miRNAs interfere with mRNA translation via inhibition of translation elongation and/or targeting of mRNAs for degradation. mRNAs exert pronounced silencing functions (1085) under stress or disease conditions, mRNAs exert pronounced silencing functions. miR-125b binds to the 3\u2032UTR of the Apelin gene, which is a negative repressor of the fibrogenic pathway. in vivo abolishment of miR-125b prevents ANG II-induced cardiac and perivascular fibrosis (735) miRNAs regulate vascular homeostasis or its disruption under RAS activation. an miR-132 and miR-212 cluster was identified as the most highly induced miRNAs. miR-132 targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) miR-92a suppresses expression of SIRT1, KLF2, and eNOS. ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis in apoE/ mice is attenuated with miR-92a inhibition. levels of circulating miR-92a are inversely correlated with endothelial function. miR-195 contributes to ANG II-dependent AAA in mice by targeting ECM proteins (1233). ANG II-regulated microRNAs, their targets, and the cell/tissue types involved. cardiac myocyte hypertrophy 794 miR-34a ATG9A Inhibit autophagy and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy 1133 miR-145 KLF4 Induce myocardin and inhibit VSMC proliferation 962 miR-let-7i IL-6/collagens Inhibit cardiac fibrosis and inflammation 1124 * miR-205 is the human homologue of murine miR-712. lncRNAs SLC17A9, SPATA9, and C16orf95 were downregulated in human VSMCs treated with ANG II (1108). lncRNA CHRF in cardiac myocytes acts as an antagomir for miR-489 during ANG II stimulation and increases expression of the miR-489 target, Myd88. expression of lncRNA PVT1 is increased in hypertrophied mouse hearts with TAC. serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) on mouse kidneys following ANG II infusion identified cathepsin D as a new gene regulated by ANG II that was functionally characterized to interact and affect blood pressure regulation (932) RNA-seq has led to identification of novel protein-coding and noncoding transcripts associated with ANG II stimulation in VSMCs. vascular transcriptome analysis 2 wk after ANG II infusion in mice shows sphingosine kinase 1 in the highest number of pathways affected. ANG II-stimulated VSMCs show significant upregulation of proteins related to protein synthesis, folding, and turnover. some of these proteins include those involved in mitochondria biogenesis, including PGC1-. heme oxygenase-1 is the most significantly upregulated protein in response to ANG II (508) one study identified more than 1,000 phosphorylation sites regulated by ANG II or biased ligand SII-ANG II. PKD is considered a key kinase regulating both G protein-dependent and -independent phosphorylation events of the AT1R (170) proteasome, and Alzheimer's disease-related genes suggest presence of common mechanisms underlying disease pathology in aging and ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II infusion in rats stimulates protein degradation without de novo protein synthesis in the platelet proteome, suggesting that ANG II may cause accelerated platelet aging (312) proteomic analysis was performed on exosomes derived from cardiac fibroblasts treated with ANG II. mice treated with aRB valsartan display a reduction in hypoxanthine and a recovery of cytochrome c oxidase activity (692) in addition, translational research was reported to use serum metabolomics data to predict albuminuria response to ARBs in type II diabetic patients (812). Sm22 Cre, Tie2 Cre, or S100A4 Cre driver were used to knock out smooth muscle, endothelial, or fibroblast AT1AR. vascular smooth AT1AR deficiency is preventive against ANG II-induced elevation in blood pressure. ANG II-induced vascular remodeling, contractility, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction are enhanced in inducible smooth muscle-specific PPAR-deficient mice. ANG II-induced vascular remodeling, contractility, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction are enhanced in inducible smooth muscle-specific PPAR-deficient mice. Wnt/-catenin pathway activates when a Wnt ligand binds to the seven-transmembrane Frizzled (Fz or Fzd) receptor and its coreceptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). formation of Wnt-Fz-LRP6 complex results in LRP6 phosphorylation, activation, and the recruitment of the Axin complex to the receptors. in immortalized mouse podocytes, ANG II induces Wnt1 expression. -catenin siRNA or overexpression of endogenous Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf1 attenuates ANG II-induced podocyte injury. induction of Wnt1/3 and nuclear accumulation of -catenin confirmed in mice infused with ANG II. a few manuscripts implicate the Wnt/-catenin pathway in vascular pathophysiology. ANG II rapidly stimulates -catenin nuclear accumulation. loss of -catenin downregulation could be involved in enhanced vascular remodeling. notch pathway is crucial in several developmental processes. but it has been recently implicated in cardiovascular pathophysiology. notch pathway is crucial in several developmental processes. ANG II-induced blood pressure elevation and left ventricular hypertrophy are both attenuated (871) in inducible -secretase complex silencing mice, ANG II-induced blood pressure elevation and left ventricular hypertrophy are both attenuated. notch1 appears to contribute to ANG II plus TGF-dependent EMT via Sn. notch signaling has also been implicated in development and expression of renin progenitor cells in both zebrafish (868) and mouse (66, 128) notch signaling has also been reported to be an important regulator of renin transcription (793) NLRP3 inflammasome Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing PYD-3 (NLRP3) is a pattern recognition receptor that is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation and chronic diseases a mouse model of AAA with apoE/ mice with ANG II infusion suggests a critical role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in ANG II-dependent AAA formation. further investigation suggests additional involvement of mitochondrial ROS generation by macrophages in the NLRP3 pathway (1079). ANG II induces WISP1 via CREB and NOX2/Akt/GSK-3/-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF transcriptional activation in cardiac myocytes. ANG II induces WISP1 via CREB and NOX2/Akt/GSK-3/-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF transcriptional activation through AT1R. Dickkopf1 and CREB appear to mediate induction of Wnt1 mRNA. ANG II induces -catenin protein, fibronectin mRNA, and collagen I mRNA. pyrvinium pamoate treatment ameliorates kidney induction of -catenin. ANG II stimulates -catenin nuclear accumulation in mice infused with ANG II. loss of -catenin downregulation could be involved in enhanced vascular remodeling in Nur77/ mice infused with ANG II. notch1 receptors bind to a family of four notch receptors. ligand binding is activated resulting in canonical -secretase-dependent cleavage and translocation of a transcriptional activator, notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus. suppression of the Notch3 cascade by ANG II in VSMCs was reported more than a decade ago. transcriptional activator Mastermind and a DNA-binding protein, CBF1/Su(H)/Lag2 protein (CSL) targeting the complex to gene promoters containing the consensus motif GTGGGAA, for transcriptional activation. notch has also been implicated in other ANG II pathologies.

ER stress promotes induction of a three-branched UPR initiating from three ER transmembrane sensors. PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2 upon ER stress resulting in the inhibition of most cap-dependent translation. IRE1 promotes splicing of XBP1 mRNA. active (spliced) XBP1 binds to the ER stress response element to induce chaperones and the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. IRE1 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). membrane rafts, caveolae, and caveolins are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. lipid bilayer of plasma membrane is organized into liquid-ordered and disordered domains by virtue of clustering of particular lipids. caveolae are 50\u201370 nm sigma-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. early studies showed that signaling and coupling proteins used by AT1R are present in membrane rafts and coprecipitated with caveolin-1 (Cav1) following ANG II stimulation in cultured VSMCs (419) loss of Cav1 (1164) or mutation in the caveolin consensus binding site of AT1R (550) results in improper targeting of AT1R and defective ANG II signaling. cSrc to caveolae is also important for vascular tone regulation. loss of caveolae integrity with Cav1 siRNA treatment disturbs compartmentalization of these elements on the plasma membrane. ANG II-induced inhibition of BK channel activity in VSMCs (614) global Cav1 knockout mice are viable and reproduce but show a wide variety of phenotypic defects. ANG II plus the NOS inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), mice show a reduction in biventricular damage and transcript levels of the cardiac pro-inflammatory marker plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) mice are specifically protected from vascular inflammation and remodeling induced by ANG II. the research field of microparticles and exosomes is rapidly expanding due to their possible involvement in various diseased states.

ANG II infusion increases eIF2 phosphorylation, ATF4 and CHOP mRNA (465) and protein (989) in membrane rafts, caveolae, and caveolins are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. these membrane regions form rafts, which compartmentalize sets of signaling molecules. caveolae are 50\u201370 nm sigma-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. the loss of Cav1 (1164) or mutation in the caveolin consensus binding site of AT1R (550) results in improper targeting of AT1R and defective ANG II signaling. the relationship between ANG II receptor and caveolae-based signaling adds an additional layer of cellular regulation. ANG II induces ROS production through translocation of p47phox to caveolae. reduction in oxidative stress reversed eNOS uncoupling and preserved endothelial cell function. free cholesterol promotes enrichment of lipid raft fraction with Tyr14 phosphorylated Cav1 and Rac1. global Cav1 knockout mice are viable and reproduce but show phenotypic defects. ANG II plus the NOS inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) mice on the 129/Sv background show a reduction in biventricular damage and transcript levels of the cardiac pro-inflammatory marker plasminogen activator inhibitor type I. ANG II-infused mice show aortic endothelial dysfunction associated with increased superoxide. microparticles derived from human T lymphocytes show aortic endothelial dysfunction associated with increased superoxide. ANG II infusion in apoE/ mice enhances production of EC-derived microparticles. this is due to microparticles carrying ACE, which activate EC AT1R, Nox, and downstream p38MAPK and ERK1/2 (3).

ANG II stimulation boosts exosome release from cardiac fibroblasts. exosomes exhibit hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes. autophagy is a critical mechanism needed to maintain cell and organ homeostasis through the stimulation of catabolism. ANG II-enhanced autophagy is associated with induction of beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy protein 9A (Atg9A), proteins essential for autophagosome formation. ANG II-enhanced autophagy and hypertrophic responses are associated with downregulation of miR-30 and miR-34a. ANG II-induced in vivo cardiac hypertrophy is also highlighted by increased autophagy as measured by LC3b-II and p62. deletion of the cardiac anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 enhances cardiac autophagy induced by ANG II (500) in cultured VSMCs, ANG II increases the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio and beclin-1 expression and decreases p62, suggesting stimulation of autophagy.

ANG II infusion increases class I HDAC2 activity in mouse hearts (476) ANG II stimulates Akt-dependent phosphorylation of PGC-1 on Ser570. this is required for binding of the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to PGC-1. ANG II also induces prolonged lysine acetylation of PGC-1. ANG II is associated with SIRT3 reexpression, mitochondrial protein deacetylation, and reduced mitochondrial ROS production (626) ANG II causes SIRT3 S-glutathionylation, with resultant increased SOD2 acetylation and inactivation contributing to ANG II-induced hypertension due to vascular oxidative stress.

ANG II-induced elevation in blood pressure is associated with increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased vasoconstrictor responses in the renal vasculature (987) mice with kidney principal cell-specific AT1AR deletion show a slight reduction in BP elevation in the initial phase of ANG II-dependent hypertension. hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) and PPAR are also considered to regulate ANG II functions with tissue/cell type specifically. endothelial dysfunction and augmented pressor response to ANG II were observed in inducible smooth muscle-specific PPAR-deficient mice. the mouse phenotype is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and reduced expression of catalase and SOD3 (399) PPAR target gene PPAR cofactor retinol binding protein 7 (398) ANG II-induced hypertension is attenuated in mice with smooth muscle-specific IP3 receptor triple knockout. ANG II-induced vascular remodeling is unaltered, suggesting that ANG II-induced hypertension is dispensable for vascular remodeling in certain experimental conditions (593) the PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/Rho kinase signaling cascade has been shown to promote ANG II-induced contractile responses in mesenteric arteries through MLCP inhibition (380). ANG II stimulates JAK2-dependent phosphorylation of smooth muscle expressed Arhgef1, which in turn activates RhoA and mediates ANG II-induced blood pressure elevation. mice harboring a smooth muscle-specific deletion of IKK2 exhibit a blunted hypertensive response to ANG II. the role of VSMC IKK2 in ANG II-induced hypertension is independent from NF-B activation (1205) mice harboring a smooth muscle-specific deletion exhibit a blunted hypertensive response to ANG II.

ANG II-induced vasoconstriction and hypertension are attenuated in mouse aorta. a cullin3 mutation causes pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. mice expressing CUL39, ANG II-induced vasoconstriction is enhanced. cullin3 mediates ANG II-induced hypertension via 2 pathways. opening of Cl channels within plasma membrane of VSMCs causes Cl efflux and membrane depolarization. 365 blocks increased myogenic tone in response to ANG II infusion. STIM1 is an ER Ca2+ sensor, which plays a critical role in the activation of Orai1 channels at the plasma membrane that mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry. VSMC MR-deficient mice show decreased elevation in systolic blood pressure and oxidative stress during ANG II infusion. ROS production via NADPH oxidase, Nox, induced by ANG II has been strongly implicated in ANG II pathophysiology. nox2 deletion in ECs, but not in myeloid cells, attenuates ANG II-induced hypertension in mice (898) deletion of nox1 (1208) or Nox2 (1059) does not alter hypertension, while oxidative stress is attenuated. in endothelial cell-targeted mice, enhancement of basal H2O2 production was observed. absence of microbiota in germfree mice protects from ANG II-induced hypertension. absence of microbiota in germfree mice protects from ANG II-induced vascular ROS production. role of copper transport protein antioxidant 1 in ANG II-induced hypertension.

Elevated Ca2+ can also induce ANO1 and VDCC leading to further Ca2+ entry. stimulation promotes downstream ERK signaling and ER stress. blockade of EGFR or ER stress attenuates ANG II-induced vascular wall thickening. ANG II-induced EGFR transactivation and vascular remodeling, but not hypertension, are attenuated. the concentration of ANG II used in these protocols (1 gkg1min1) may maintain hypertension even with a reduction in vascular remodeling. vascular remodeling may not be required for the establishment of hypertension in response to a high dose of continuous ANG II infusion. mice exhibit delay in ANG II-induced hypertension associated with reduced NADPH oxidase activation, VSMC proliferation, and inflammatory markers. ANG II signaling induces phosphorylation (Ser181) and degradation of SM22 through PKC-. p47phox deficiency attenuates medial expansion of the aorta. ANG II-induced hypertension and inward vascular remodeling are exaggerated in SOD1 knockout and transgenic mice. in contrast, ANG II-induced hypertension is unaltered in nox2-deficient mice (1059), while inward vascular remodeling is attenuated in cerebral arterioles (135). ANG II infusion leads to vascular Ets-1 expression, but not hypertension. MCP1, VCAM-1, PAI1, CREG, p47phox, and ROS production are proposed to be the downstream targets of Ets-1, mediating ANG II-dependent vascular remodeling. ANG II-dependent AAA is associated with inhibition of NF-B activation, MCP1 induction, and senescence. cPLA2-deficient mice are protected from ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II infusion increases vascular expression of Ca2+-independent PLA2. ANG II induces ADAM17 activity and resultant EGFR activation leading to downstream ERK/Akt/p70S6K activation, HIF-1 induction, and ER stress resulting in hypertrophy. additional evidence is needed for other kinases and Nox/ROS in mediating ANG II-dependent vascular remodeling. 414 VSMC iPLA2 smmhc-Tg 110 VSMC JAK2 f/f-sm22 Cre 499 VSMC Nox1 smmhc-Tg 234 VSMC Sirt1 sm22 Tg 306 Fibroblast AT1AR S100A4 Tg 825 Macrophage C1q C1qa/ 1010 B cell IgG BAFF-R/134 * Ca2+/calmodulin N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (ACE) prevents vascular fibrosis without altering hypertension or arterial medial thickening in rats infused with ANG II. ANG II-induced NF-B activation, inflammation, and perivascular fibrosis but not vascular hypertrophy. AT1R signaling appears to be at the crux of fibrotic signaling. inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein reduces AT1R expression. direct inhibition of AT1R is also protective against perivascular fibrosis. this cardiac phenotype is associated with suppression of mRNAs for CTGF, TGF-, and collagen type III. a role for vascular Notch signaling through -secretase in perivascular fibrosis has also been reported (785). ANG II mechanisms of arterial stiffness have been reviewed before. a selective AT2R agonist, C21, reduces vascular stiffness in two distinct hypertension models in rats without altering blood pressure. increased arterial stiffness induced by ANG II infusion in mice is attenuated with normalization of blood pressure by hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. hypertension is not inhibited in this study, suggesting a complex relationship among adventitial mechanical stress, inflammation, and hypertension. ANG II infusion enhances vascular MMP2 activity through a mechanism involving ADAM17 and MMP7. ANG II infusion enhances vascular MMP2 activity through a mechanism involving ADAM17 and MMP7. VSMC apoptosis is proposed as a potential mechanism regulated by ER stress (989) other potential VSMC mechanisms contributing to arterial stiffness include arginase-1, lysyl oxidase (Lox), cullin-3, and COX-2. ANG II increases expression and activity of arginase-1 in VSMCs. ANG II-enhanced vascular fibrosis and arterial stiffness require mechanisms involving adventitial fibroblasts, VSMCs, immune cells, and ECM modulation interacting with inflammatory mediators. ANG II-enhanced vascular fibrosis and arterial stiffness require mechanisms involving adventitial fibroblasts, VSMCs, immune cells, and ER stress. AT1R can induce TGF-1 through an ADAM17/TNF- pathway and through EGFR transactivation leading to ER stress and ROS generation. ANG II-induced MR activation also induces ASK1 and downstream Nox induction leading to ROS and TGF-1 signaling. recent core review articles have few descriptions of RAS signaling and molecular and cellular mechanisms of atherosclerosis. ANG II promotes hypertension and ROS to cause endothelial dysfunction (319) and contribution of leukocyte ACE (612). ACE may play a role in the central role of IFN- in inflammatory activation. suppression of ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis is observed in apoE/ mice. the role of TNF- has also been tested in ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis. calpain 2 appears to compensate for loss of calpain 1 for ANG II-induced AAA formation (1004) in apoE/ Bcl10/ mice infused with ANG II, there is significant reduction of development of atherosclerosis and AAA compared with control apoE/ mice infused with ANG II (673). IL-17A appears to be critical for ANG II-induced hypertension (630). endothelial nox2 transgenic mice bred onto the apoE/ genetic background show enhanced vascular ROS production, VCAM-1 induction, and macrophage accumulation. but ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis or hypertension is unaltered (243). inflammatory responses are enhanced in apoE kinin B1 receptor double-knockout mice infused with ANG II, suggesting this receptor elicits protective signaling against ANG II pathology. a recent study demonstrated suppression of ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis as well as AAA by inhibitors of factor Xa. distinct phenotypes in ANG II-dependent AAA and TAA have been recognized. ANG II has been implicated in cerebral/intracranial aneurysm development and rupture. ANG II signaling via NF-B within the endothelium is required for ANG II-dependent AAA (900). selectively silencing of NF-B/RelA in mesenchymal cell by Cre recombinase expression leads to RelA deletion in VSMCs and fibroblasts. VSMC ADAM17-deficient mice are also protected from ANG II-induced AAA development. systemic Rgs1 deletion protected mice from atherosclerosis. leukocyte KLF5 deficiency protected ANG II-induced AAA formation. role of perivascular visceral adipose tissue AT1AR contributing to ANG II-induced AAA. deletion of VSMC ADAM17 prevents AAA development in mice. this is associated with reduction in aortic EGFR activation, oxidative stress, ER stress, and immune cell accumulation. apoE/ TRIF/ mice showed that TRIF mediates ANG II-dependent AAA (1097) STAT3 activation in AAA is also inhibited in apoE/ TLR4/ mice, as well as in Eritoran (a TLR4 inhibitor)-treated mice infused with ANG II. ANG II show attenuation of AAA formation with decreased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), MCP1, monocyte infiltration, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the aorta. disruption of this signaling scaffold using Hic5/ mice prevents AAA development in an ANG II apoE/ mouse model (556) ANG II-induced AAA is exacerbated in apoE/ nox2/ mice compared with control apoE/ mice. the mechanism was reported to involve enhanced macrophage-derived IL-1 production. ANG II infusion for 4 wk causes AAA in mice, but not in wild-type control mice. AAA is associated with reduced ECM contents and enhanced MMP2 activity. the most common area for TAA development is the aortic root. smooth muscle and elastic fiber degeneration creates an environment favoring vessel expansion and dilation, leading to aneurysm development (420). ANG II appears to play a critical role in both syndromic and nonsyndromic TAA. EC-specific deletion of AT1AR in mice infused with ANG II shows reductions in medial thickness, elastin breaks, aortic arch area, and length compared with controls. VSMC-specific deletion of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in mice results in elastin fragmentation and aortic dilation in the ascending aorta. the role of TGF- in TAA and AD pathology remains controversial. a mouse with hypomorphic fibrillin-1 homozygous mutation develops AT1R-dependent TAA. inducible smooth muscle selective TGFBR2 deletion leads to severe TAA phenotype with enhanced ERK signaling. signaling intermediates protect from development of TAA and/or AD in response to ANG II infusion, which include Akt2, MMP2, and SIRT1. MMP17-deficient mice have enhanced susceptibility to TAA and AD upon ANG II infusion. reduced osteopontin cleavage by MMP17 reduces JNK activity. a role for SIRT1 has also appeared in AD pathophysiology. ANG II is a crucial mediator of signal transduction resulting in vascular pathological complication that appears distinct based on the aortic area. ANG II has emerged as a crucial mediator of signal transduction resulting in vascular pathological complication. 858 LDLr/ AT1ARff SM22-Crea \"\" 858 arr2 apoE/ arr2/\" 1065 Bcl10 apoE/ Bcl10/ \"\" 673 Calpain-1/2 LDLr/ BMT CAST-Tgb \" 395 LDLr/ calpain inhibitor \"\" 1005 CCR2 apoE/ CCR2/ \" 209 CD14 apoE/ CD14/\" 287 CXCL10 \"\" 905 MyD88 apoE/ KLF4ff SMMHC Cre\" \" 783 NLRP3 apoE/ Nlrp3/\" \"\" 1079 Notch1 apoE/ Notch1+/ BMT\" \"\" 975 Nox2 LDLr/ Nox2-/y 490 Nox2 apoE/ Tie2 Nox2-Tg \"\" cBoth calpain-1 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ or calpain-2 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ mice are compared with the control Cre/ littermates. phenotype was not confirmed with bone marrow TLR4 deficiency. elastase/ANG II-induced intracranial aneurysm development and rupture are significantly reduced. tPA-plasmin axis is known to promote inflammatory processes. tPA-plasmin axis is known to promote inflammatory processes. PPAR activity has been identified to protect mice from intracranial aneurysm development and rupture. a transcriptional factor, Sox17, is essential for vascular development. a partially overlapping mechanism by which ANG II promotes intracranial aneurysm development and rupture in mice (553) ANG II rapidly and potently induces overproduction of ROS in the endothelium. ANG II induces early activation of the superoxide generating enzyme NADPH oxidase. this process involves phosphorylating the p47phox and activate Rac-1. reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can interact with lipids and proteins. this alteration in biopterin results in the uncoupling of eNOS to a state where the enzyme no longer produces NO but adds to the ROS pool by producing superoxide (100). ANG II has also been strongly implicated in endothelial inflammation (648) novel mechanisms of ANG II causing endothelial dysfunction. new mechanisms include AT1R/P2Y6 receptor heterodimer (752), AT1R/LOX1 receptor heterodimer (1185), ER stress/UPR (465), miR-92A (157), sphingosine kinase 1(Sphk1) (967), Sphk2 (1171), STIM1 (464), SIRT3 S-glutathionylation the protective role of endothelial S1P receptor (S1PR1) against ANG II-induced hypertension has also been demonstrated. ANG II promotes vasoconstriction through AT1R-dependent heterotrimeric G protein activation of Gq/11 and G12/13. this leads to increased MLC phosphorylation through increased MLCK and decreased MLCP/MYPT1 activity. ANG II-induced hypertension is dispensable for vascular remodeling in certain experimental conditions (593) new regulators of these converging cascades include a myosin phosphatase inhibitory protein, a myosin phosphatase inhibitory protein, and a RhoGAP, GRAF3 deletion in mice. ANG II-induced vasoconstriction along with increases in ROCK2 and PKC-/ (1003) further research has uncovered the activation of Arhgef1 by ANG II in human VSMCs and peripheral mononuclear cells.

MR stimulation promotes increased blood pressure, oxidative stress, vascular contraction, and expression of L-type Ca2+ channels. smooth muscle specific Nox1 transgenic mice demonstrate enhanced ROS production, hypertension, and vascular remodeling in response to ANG II infusion. smooth muscle CYP1B1-mediated ROS production has also been implicated in ANG II-induced hypertension (430, 823) smooth muscle CYP1B1-mediated ROS production has also been implicated in ANG II-induced hypertension. silencing of SOD3 in circumventricular organs, augments hypertension induced by ANG II infusion emphasizing the role of brain ROS in ANG II-induced hypertension (607). Specifically, T cells appear to contribute to ANG II-induced hypertension in mice (54, 1093). significant advances have been made in determining the direct signaling ANG II mediates to regulate vasoconstriction in vivo. evidence appears to indicate tight regulation of Ca2+ and Cl through multiple avenues (FIGURE 4). however, additional investigations are desired regarding the potential roles of putative kinases, other receptors, and ROS/Nox in ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II-induced hypertension is attenuated in mice with smooth muscle-specific IP3 receptor triple knockout (IP3 has 3 genes and subtypes), suggesting ANG II-induced hypertension is dispensable for vascular remodeling in certain experimental conditions (593). KC-potentiated myosin phosphatase inhibitor of 17 kDa (CPI-17) and a RhoGAP, GRAF3 deletion in mice enhances ANG II-induced vasoconstriction along with increases in ROCK2 and PKC-/ (1003).

ANG II-induced hypertension is induced by ANG II in VSMC (326). evidence appears to indicate tight regulation of Ca2+ and Cl through multiple avenues (FIGURE 4). however, additional investigations are desired regarding the potential roles of putative kinases, other receptors, and ROS/Nox in ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II promotes vascular hypertrophy and hyperplasia through downstream ERK1/2 signaling. EGFR stimulation promotes downstream ERK signaling and ER stress. blockade of EGFR or ER stress attenuates ANG II-induced vascular wall thickening. ANG II-dependent vascular remodeling (288, 1077) mice also show reduced ROS production. EGFR and JAK2 appear to be key upstream tyrosine kinases in mediating vascular remodeling induced by ANG II. serine threonine kinases In vivo pharmacological investigation in mice suggests that CaMKII contributes to hypertension and the hypertrophic response elicited by ANG II. ANG II-induced arterial medial thickening is independent of blood pressure in mice (784) p47phox deficiency attenuates medial expansion of the aorta, and a redox-sensitive gene, ID3, deficiency reduces hyperplasia within the ascending aorta (784). smooth muscle specific mice demonstrate enhanced ROS production, hypertension, and vascular remodeling in response to ANG II infusion, which are attenuated with the antioxidant Tempol (234). smooth muscle HIF-1-deficient mice develop hypertension and hyperresponsiveness to ANG II. ANG II infusion leads to vascular Ets-1 expression, and ANG II-induced vascular remodeling. elastin is the closest homologue to yeast silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) protein in the humans. it functions as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein and histone deacetylase. ANG II-induced hypertension and vascular remodeling are enhanced. significant advancements have been made in understanding how ANG II can instigate vascular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. a key hallmark to this cascade appears to be ADAM17 activation and downstream ERK1/2 activation (FIGURE 6). however, there is still controversy highlighted by the evidence that EC or VSMC AT1R depletion does not prevent ANG II-induced medial thickening. ANG II regulates hypertrophic/proliferative signaling via cPLA2/c-Src/ERK and iPLA2B/lipoxygenase/c-Jun signaling. EGFR, JAK2, and hypertension-independent mechanisms. EGFR stimulation promotes downstream ERK signaling and ER stress. blockade of EGFR or ER stress attenuates ANG II-induced vascular wall thickening. ANG II-induced EGFR transactivation and vascular remodeling, but not hypertension, are attenuated. infusion model with both genetic [Cav1 or ADAM17 deletion (288, 1034)] and pharmacological [EGFR inhibitor erlotinib or ER stress inhibitor PBA, 4-phenylbutyrate (1035) interventions, suppression of vascular remodeling does not alter hypertension. the concentration of ANG II used in these protocols may maintain hypertension even with a reduction in vascular remodeling. mice exhibit delay in ANG II-induced hypertension associated with reduced NADPH oxidase activation, VSMC proliferation, and inflammatory markers. p47phox deficiency attenuates medial expansion of the aorta, and a redox-sensitive gene, ID3, deficiency reduces hyperplasia within the ascending aorta (784). ANG II-induced hypertension and vascular medial hypertrophy is blunted (310) in nox1 null mice. ANG II-induced hypertension and inward vascular remodeling are exaggerated. ANG II-induced hypertension is unaltered in nox2-deficient mice (1059) ANG II infusion leads to vascular Ets-1 expression, and ANG II-induced vascular remodeling, but not hypertension. ANG II infusion leads to vascular Ets-1 expression, and ANG II-induced vascular remodeling, but not hypertension. a few negative regulatory transcriptional factors against ANG II-induced vascular remodeling have also been reported. ANG II is a known activator of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and arachidonic acid production, resulting in downstream eicosanoid production. cPLA2-deficient mice are protected from ANG II-induced hypertension and show significant prevention of vascular remodeling. ANG II induces ADAM17 activity and resultant EGFR activation leading to downstream ERK/Akt/p70S6K activation, HIF-1 induction, and ER stress resulting in hypertrophy. additional evidence is needed for other kinases and Nox/ROS in mediating ANG II-dependent vascular remodeling.

AT1R signaling appears to be at the crux of fibrotic signaling. inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein reduces AT1R expression. direct inhibition of AT1R is also protective against perivascular fibrosis. is attenuated in heterozygous Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1+/) mice without altering cardiac hypertrophy (869) this cardiac phenotype is associated with suppression of mRNAs for CTGF, TGF-, and collagen type III. a role for vascular Notch signaling through -secretase in perivascular fibrosis has also been reported (785) ANG II mechanisms of arterial stiffness have been reviewed before. a selective AT2R agonist, C21, reduces vascular stiffness in two distinct hypertension models in rats without altering blood pressure. p38 inhibition attenuates hypertension, adventitial collagen contents, and arterial stiffness in ANG II-infused mice. ANG II-infused mice reduce blood pressure, oxidative stress/inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. stimulation of Treg proliferation in ANG II-infused mice via an IL-2/mAbCD25 immune complex rescues mice from collagen accumulation and arterial stiffening. ER stress also plays a role in enhancing arterial stiffness in mice infused with ANG II (59). VSMC apoptosis is proposed as a potential mechanism regulated by ER stress (989) other potential VSMC mechanisms contributing to arterial stiffness include arginase-1, lysyl oxidase (Lox), cullin-3, and COX-2. ANG II-enhanced vascular fibrosis and arterial stiffness require mechanisms involving adventitial fibroblasts, VSMCs, immune cells, and ECM modulation interacting with inflammatory mediators. ANG II also upregulates the receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL) system in VSMCs. TGF-1 plays a central role in ANG II-induced vascular fibrosis. AT1R can induce p38 activation and Arg-1 expression. ANG II-induced MR activation also induces ASK1 and downstream Nox induction leading to ROS and TGF-1 signaling. adventitial fibroblast signaling in promoting paracrine signaling. activation of ADAM17 mediates EGFR transactivation, ER stress, oxidative stress, and perivascular fibrosis. ANG II-induced TNF- facilitates cardiac interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. suppression of ER stress attenuates ANG II-induced collagen accumulation in VSMCs (1034) calpains have been proposed as downstream of EGFR transactivation. ANG II-induced cardiac perivascular fibrosis is attenuated in heterozygous Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1+/) mice without altering cardiac hypertrophy (869) low-dose MR blocker, spironolactone, attenuates perivascular fibrosis and cardiac NADPH oxidase activity. vascular MR-deficient mice develop less vascular fibrosis from aging and are protected from ANG II-induced vascular oxidative stress and hypertension. enhanced arterial stiffness induced by ANG II infusion in mice is attenuated with normalization of blood pressure by hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. p38 inhibition attenuates hypertension, adventitial collagen contents, and arterial stiffness in ANG II-infused mice. ANG II infusion enhances vascular MMP2 activity through a mechanism involving ADAM17 and MMP7. if TIMPs override MMPs, a depressed degradation of collagen type I and elastin may facilitate aortic stiffness and organ fibrosis. ER stress also plays a role in enhancing arterial stiffness. ANG II further enhances vascular Lox expression, and BAPN reduces ANG II-induced arterial stiffness. ANG II also upregulates the receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL) system. blockade of AT1R prevents RANKL expression and vascular calcification in ovariectomized apoE/ mice fed with high-fat diet (780). overall, ANG II-enhanced vascular fibrosis and arterial stiffness require mechanisms involving adventitial fibroblasts, VSMCs, immune cells, and ECM modulation interacting with inflammatory mediators and related signal transduction. ANG II contributes to initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by inducing endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, thrombosis, and plaque destabilization in humans (1081). it has been proposed that AT1R activation on inflammatory cells can be a major mechanism of ANG II contribution to atherosclerosis. however, no consistent data have been accumulated for bone marrow deletion of the receptor. smooth muscle ACE activity appears to be critical for hypocholesteremia-induced atherosclerosis. smooth muscle specific ACE knockout mice on an LDR / background are resistant against high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. other components of the RAS may be dispensable in the development of atherosclerosis. phenotype unaltered (1166) in CCR2 apoE double-knockout mice (209). ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis and AAA are attenuated. calpain 1 or 2 deletion also attenuates ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis. apoE/ Bcl10/ mice infused with ANG II show significant reduction of development of atherosclerosis and AAA compared with control apoE/ mice infused with ANG II (673). mitochondrial ROS are also required for ANG II enhanced atherosclerosis (460) PPAR is increased in the vasculature of mice infused with ANG II. treatment with a PPAR agonist attenuates vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis seems to involve enhanced NO bioavailability. there is consensus that systemic AT1R deletion prevents atherosclerosis in mice. there is also a limitation in studying downstream signal transduction of the AT1R in promoting atherosclerosis. smooth muscle specific ACE knockout mice on an LDR / background are resistant against high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. 154 studies suggest that VSMC-derived ANG II acts on other cell types (possibly fibroblasts) or an ANG II-independent action of VSMC ACE may play a role. calpain 1 or 2 deletion also attenuates ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis, but not AAA. calpain 1 or 2 deletion also attenuates ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis, but not AAA. herosclerosis and AAA compared with control apoE/ mice infused with ANG II (673) mitochondrial ROS are also required for ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis (460) treatment with PPAR agonist attenuates vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis seems to involve enhanced NO bioavailability. treatment with PPAR agonist prevents ANG II-enhanced atherosclerosis. the clinical use of ANG II infusion (207) has contributed to the research field. ANG II infusion also causes TAA mainly at ascending aorta of hypercholesteremic mouse (209) limited information is available regarding the cell/tissue type specific signaling mechanism critical for AAA development in response to ANG II. apoE/ mice with a systemic AT1AR deletion are protected from ANG II-induced AAA development. however, AT1AR depletion in either ECs or VSMCs does not protect against ANG II-induced AAA development. apoE/Rag2/ mice also impair early monocyte-mediated increases in blood pressure in response to ANG II. a terminator of heterotrimeric Gi activation appears to be upregulated in activated monocytes in apoE/ mice. membrane receptors contributing to ANG II-dependent AAA include EGFR, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and notch1 (353). EGFR inhibition by erlotinib attenuates AAA development and downstream mediators of AAA including IL-6, MMP2, ER stress, and oxidative stress (766) Deficiency in bone marrow-derived cells also attenuates both pathologies. IAXO-102 is a novel TLR4 antagonist. ANG II-infused mice treated with IAXO-102 show reduced aortic expansion. CD14-deficient apoE/ mice develop less AAA compared with the control apoE/ mice infused with ANG II (82). Other signal intermediates contributing to AAA include Wnt/LRPs, NLRP3 inflammasome, arrestin-2, focal adhesion protein hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5), L-type Ca2+ channel, AMPK2 and nox. hph-1 mice with enhanced uncoupling of eNOS develop AAA with ANG II infusion. deletion of p47phox prevents ANG II-induced AAA formation in apoE/ mice. enhanced NF-B, C/EBP, and iNOS induction is observed. CCN proteins are a group of secreted ECM-associated, partially identical cysteine-rich proteins that mediate diverse biologic functions. mechanism appears to involve suppression of ERK activation and ROS production by CCN3 in VSMC. IL-6 deficiency in mice is known to protect against ANG II-induced AAD in mice. ANG II also promotes accumulation of CD4+-T-helper (Th) 17 cells in aorta. endothelial Nox2 transgenic mice were used to demonstrate that ANG II-induced endothelial ROS release promotes vascular inflammation. inflammatory responses, ROS production, and MMP induction are attenuated. ANG II signaling via NF-B within the endothelium is required for ANG II-dependent AAA (900). selectively silencing of NF-B/RelA in mesenchymal cell by Cre recombinase expression leads to RelA deletion in VSMCs and fibroblasts. protein signal 1 (Rgs1) appears to be upregulated in activated monocytes in apoE/ mice. systemic Rgs1 deletion protected mice from ANG II-induced AAA development and rupture. leukocyte KLF5 deficiency protected ANG II-induced AAA formation, podosome formation, and associated inflammation. inhibition by erlotinib attenuates AAA development and downstream mediators of AAA. deletion of Cav1 is required for ANG II-induced ADAM17 activation. ER stress inhibitor is also effective in preventing ANG II-induced AAA. apoE/ TRIF/ mice showed that TRIF mediates ANG II-dependent AAA (1097) STAT3 activation in AAA is also inhibited in apoE/ TLR4/ mice, as well as in Eritoran (a TLR4 inhibitor)-treated mice infused with ANG II. apoE/ mice treated with ANG II show attenuation of AAA formation with decreased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), MCP1, monocyte infiltration, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the aorta along with reduced MMP production (1065) ANG II-induced ROS in VSMCs promotes expression of Hic-5, which serves as a scaffold for MAPKK4/MKK4 and p54 JNK. a conflicting report demonstrates that ANG II-induced AAA is exacerbated in apoE/ nox2/ mice compared with control apoE/ mice. the mechanism was reported to involve enhanced macrophage-derived IL-1 production (490) ANG II infusion for 4 wk causes AAA in mice, but not in wild-type control mice. AAA is associated with reduced ECM contents and enhanced MMP2 activity. the most common area for TAA development is the aortic root. smooth muscle and elastic fiber degeneration creates an environment favoring vessel expansion and dilation, leading to aneurysm development. ANG II appears to play a critical role in both syndromic and nonsyndromic TAA. EC-specific deletion of AT1AR in mice infused with ANG II shows reductions in medial thickness, elastin breaks, aortic arch area, and length compared with controls. VSMC-specific deletion of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in mice results in elastin fragmentation and aortic dilation in the ascending aorta. ANG II/AT1R-dependent development of TAA and AD has been implicated in ANG II/AT1R-dependent development of TAA and AD. TGF- acts via a heteromeric complex of TGF- type 1 and 2 receptors (TGFBR1 or 2). inducible smooth muscle selective TGFBR2 deletion leads to severe TAA phenotype with enhanced ERK activation. signaling intermediates protect from development of TAA and/or AD in response to ANG II infusion, which include Akt2, MMP2, and SIRT1. a missense mutation of MMP17 is found in patients with TAA. a role for SIRT1 has also appeared in AD pathophysiology. a role for SIRT1 has also appeared in AD pathophysiology. ANG II is a crucial mediator of signal transduction resulting in vascular pathological complication that appears distinct based on the aortic area and the pathology being studied. ANG II has emerged as a crucial mediator of signal transduction resulting in vascular pathology. \"\" 858 arr2 apoE/ arr2/\" 1065 Bcl10 apoE/ Bcl10/ \"\" 673 Calpain-1/2 LDLr/ calpainff LysM Crec \"395 LDLr/ calpain inhibitor \"\" 1005 CCR2 apoE/ CCR2/ \" 209 CD14 apoE/ CD14/\" 287 CXCL10 apoE/ CXCL10/ \" 497 ETA \"\" 905 MyD88 apoE/ / LDLr/ MyD88/d \" 783 NLRP3 apoE/ Nlrp3/\" \"\" 353 Nox1 hph-1 Nox1/\" \"\" 975 Nox2 LDLr/ Nox2-/y 490 Nox2 apoE/ Tie2 Nox2-Tg \"\" cBoth calpain-1 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ or calpain-2 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ mice are compared with the control Cre/ littermates. the phenotype was not confirmed with bone marrow TLR4 deficiency. VSMC-specific deletion of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in mice results in elastin fragmentation and aortic dilation in the ascending aorta. VSMC-specific fibulin-4 (Fbln4)-deficient mice show TAA development, which can be prevented using AT1R blocker losartan or ACE inhibitor captopril. mouse models of Loeys-Dietz syndrome with a knock-in mutation of TGFBR1 or 2 leads to compensatory enhancement of TGF- signaling with upregulation of TGF-. the role of TGF- in TAA and AD pathology remains controversial. signaling intermediates protect ANG II-induced TAA and/or AD. Akt2 signaling appears to increase susceptibility to TAA and AD. expression of Akt2, but not Akt1, is reduced in human samples. VSMC SIRT1 knockout mice show enhanced ROS production, MMP2/9 gene expression, and reduced TIMP1 expression. a role for SIRT1 has also appeared in AD pathophysiology. mice treated with ANG II plus high-fat diet are also protected from ANG II-induced AD. nox1-deficient mice are also protected from ANG II-induced AD in which nox1 suppresses vascular TIMP1 expression. \" 673 Calpain-1/2 LDLr/ calpainff LysM Crec \" 395 LDLr/ calpain inhibitor \"\" 1005 CCR2 apoE/ CCR2/ \" 209 CD14 apoE/ CD14/\" 287 CXCL10 apoE/ \" 497 ETA/BR apoE/ ETA/BR antagonist\" \"\" 1079 Notch1 apoE/ Notch1+/ BMT\" \" 353 Nox1 hph-1 Nox1/\" \"\" 975 Nox2 LDLr/ Nox2-/y 490 Nox2 apoE/ Tie2 Nox2-Tg \"\" \"\"\" 1097 Wnt apoE/ Trif. cBoth calpain-1 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ or calpain-2 flox/flox LysM Cre+/ mice are compared with the control Cre/ littermates. phenotype was confirmed in both apoE/ MyD88/ mice and LDLr/ MyD88/ mice. myeloperoxidase is a major oxidative enzyme produced by activated neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. elastase/ANG II-induced intracranial aneurysm development and rupture are significantly reduced. tPA-plasmin axis is known to promote inflammatory processes. iency in addition to ANG II infusion induces intracranial aneurysm development and rupture in mice (553) iency in addition to ANG II infusion induces intracranial aneurysm development and rupture similar to that observed in AAA and TAA. endothelial cells are exposed to blood constituents and the hemodynamic forces generated by blood flow. ANG II induces early activation of the superoxide generating enzyme NADPH oxidase. this process involves ANG II-dependent activation of PKC and Src. each is a necessary subunit for NADPH oxidase complex formation and ROS production in endothelial cells (746) ANG II activates the NF-B cascade, induces VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and enhances leukocyte endothelial interaction (648, 922) the role ROS, inflammatory cytokines and immune cells play in ANG II-induced endothelial dysfunction are also described in the previous sections and section X. novel mechanisms of ANG II causing endothelial dysfunction. new mechanisms include AT1R/P2Y6 receptor heterodimer (752), AT1R/LOX1 receptor heterodimer (1185), ER stress/UPR (465), miR-92A (157), sphingosine kinase 1(Sphk1) (967), Sphk2 (1171), STIM1 (464), and SIRT3 S-glutathiony an initial key step in the production of ANG II is the metabolism of ANG I to ANG II by ACE. ANG II rapidly and potently induces overproduction of ROS in the endothelium. ANG II induces early activation of the superoxide generating enzyme NADPH oxidase. NO can be rapidly sequestered by superoxide and converted into a long-lived, toxic reactive compound, peroxynitrite. this alteration in biopterin results in the uncoupling of eNOS to a state where the enzyme no longer produces NO but adds to the ROS pool by producing superoxide (100). ANG II has also been strongly implicated in endothelial inflammation (648) ANG II has been shown to produce NO via eNOS activation in cultured endothelial cells (1017) transgenic expression of constitutively active AT1R mutant (N111G) in endothelial cells with Tie1 promoter in mice exhibited reduced systolic blood pressure. mutant AT1R can be further activated upon ANG II binding. novel mechanisms of ANG II causing endothelial dysfunction. mice lacking endothelial Nogo-B are protected from ANG II-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. protective role of endothelial S1P receptor (S1PR1) against ANG II-induced hypertension has also been demonstrated. local ANG II levels are increased in the heart in pathological conditions, particularly in diabetes. ANG II signal transduction in cardiac tissue is well established, and readers are directed towards a previous review on the subject. there seems to be very limited review of this topic recently except for one article covering the role of signaling by cardiac GPCRs, including AT1R. recent advances in the past decade will be discussed to broaden these and other new cascades. a high pressor dose exhibits concentric left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension with a variable contribution of volume overload caused by aortic valve insufficiency (375). pathological cardiac hypertrophy is also associated with endothelial dysfunction, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and capillary rarefaction or a decrease in the capillary to myocyte number (951) cardiomyocyte-specific expression of AT1R-associated protein suppresses development of cardiac hypertrophy, activation of p38MAPK, and induction of hypertrophy-related genes in the mouse ANG II infusion model without affecting increases in blood pressure. ang II has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo via the activation of a number of canonical signaling cascades. ANG II enhances expression of CIKS in cardiac myocytes leading to IKK/NF-B and JNK/AP1 activation and subsequent induction of MMP9 and IL-18, a potent growth factor for cardiac myocytes. however, genetic ablation of CIKS blocked ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, but had no effect on the increase in blood pressure (1082) recruitment of adaptor protein TAB2 and subsequent binding of TRAF6 to TGF--activated kinase 1 (TAK1) may also contribute to ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. ANG II-infused rats are protected from cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. osteoprotegerin is a secretory glycoprotein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily that generally acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL. ANG II-induced dilated cardiomyopathy was reported to depend on the T cell Th2 phenotype (816) and to involve the Th2 polarizing cytokine IL-4 (815) recent evidence has also highlighted a beneficial role for PPAR in blocking ANG II-induced upregulation of Nox2/Nox4 and nuclear translocation of NF-B p65. mitochondrial targeted antioxidant peptide attenuates ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. the small GTPase RhoA regulates RhoA activation in the heart in response to ANG II (1036) it is linked to activation of myocardin-related transcription factors, cardiac hypertrophy, and eventual heart failure. AKAP-Lbc is a scaffold for various proteins involved in classical signal transduction including PKC, PKD1 and PKA. a paracrine mechanism involving CTGF and FGF2 (952) is under negative regulation by regulators of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) and RGS5, which attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo from ANG II (564, 603) evidence indicates that MMP2 may act as an initial brake on ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2)-mediated transcription of HMGCR (1121). ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy in part via IP3-mediated Ca2+ release downstream of GPCR signaling (742). Ca2+ contributes to cardiac hypertrophy by several means including activation of NFAT and CaMKII (524, 951) AT1R -arrestin-biased signaling leads to MLC2v phosphorylation via the ERK1/2-RSK3 cascade. RSK3 may also couple to activation of SRF and induction of SERCA2 protein expression. TRV120027 may be a useful therapeutic agent for treating acute heart failure. EGFR transactivation also elicits downstream ER stress leading to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (465, 1035). ANG II-induced EGFR transactivation is dependent on nox2/Nox4-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 (1236). ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis is independently from blood pressure (1123). ET-1 expression by activation of c-Jun/c-Fos (AP1) and formation of chromatin remodeling complex. AP1-mediated recruitment of a histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase. others report that endothelial tyrosine kinase Bmx and subsequent activation of STAT3 is necessary for ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis due to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines protein 4 signaling contributes to the development of ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy via phosphorylation and DNA-binding protein inhibitor (Id1) induction. ANG II elicits an upregulation of BMP4 expression, ALK2 receptor binding, and activation of Smad1/5 and Id1 signaling, thus constituting an autocrine loop for cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II-induced expression of IGF receptor II (IGF-IIR) is attributed to proteasome-mediated degradation of SIRT1 downstream of JNK activation via AT1R. ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy by multiple means involving direct actions on cardiac myocytes. canonical signaling, transactivation of EGFR, and inflammatory signaling. the later may involve other cell types as the source of ROS. ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy is driven by nox4- and nox2-derived ROS. inflammatory cytokines stimulate hypertrophy by releasing FGF-2, fibulin-2, TGF-, and exosomes that are enriched in passenger strand miR-21*. counterregulatory mechanisms that attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling could be exploited therapeutically. anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 deficiency enhances ANG II-induced gene expression of TNF-, IL-6, and MMP-2/9. IL-10 activates Akt/mTORC1 signaling and attenuates ANG II-induced pathological autophagy 500, 528 IRF7 Interferon regulatory factor 7. noncardiomyocyte-targeted STAT3 deletion does not attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. contractile function was impaired and metabolic homeostasis was disturbed with ANG II treatment. findings suggest that AT1R may pair to protective prosurvival signaling in the heart. Xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 2 (Xirp2) is a protein that is highly expressed in cardiac muscle and plays a role in the formation of intercalated disks (ICDs) of the heart. Xirp2 deficiency is associated with basal cardiac hypertrophy in unstressed mice. cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response to ANG II infusion. however, this explanation is at odds with the previously mentioned finding that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response. ANG II-induced ERK1/2 activation in cardiac myocytes downregulates miR-133a levels (582), an event that results in cardiac hypertrophy (120, 244) ERK1/2 signaling, rather than being essential for cardiac hypertrophy, may coordinate concentric and eccentric growth. ANG II downregulates TIEG1 expression in association with induction of hypertrophy. overexpression of adiponectin prevents cardiac hypertrophy in rats infused with ANG II by increasing AMPK activity. loss of IL-10 worsens ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. induced cytokine that is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts attenuates ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (908) the issue of renin expression in the heart is controversial, and evidence for non-renin-dependent mechanisms in the local formation of cardiac peptides is reported. downstream consequences include decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity and ROS formation, reduced inflammatory cytokine activity and synthesis, as well as increased apoptosis. most studies have shown increased mortality and impaired cardiac function post-MI with AT2R deletion with variable effects in attenuating cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. a strain effect may influence outcome at least with aortic stenosis (41) AT2R knockout in mice was reported to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and reduce fibrosis. a novel regulatory T cell subset that expresses AT2R has a beneficial impact on infarct size and heart function. overexpression of ACE2 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. ACE2 deficiency exacerbates adverse cardiac remodeling caused by diabetes. ANG (1\u20137) infusion was found to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and reduce cardiac fibrosis. endothelial cell expression of Brg1 and FoxM1 is increased in human hypertrophic hearts and correlates with the ACE/ACE2 expression ratio. pathological cardiac remodeling is a severe alteration in the structure of the heart due to changes at the molecular and cellular level that impair contractility and heart function. periostin is a secreted ECM protein that functions in cellular adhesion and migration as a ligand for V/3 and V/5 integrins via its FAS1\u20132 domains (778). ANG II increases periostin expression in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts directly via a Ras/p38MAPK/CREB signaling pathway and indirectly via induction of TGF-1 expression. fibrosis in the interventricular septum and left ventricular free wall (712) Previously studied sources of cardiac myofibroblasts were found to have a negligible contribution. this conclusion is seemingly at odds with previous findings of several groups showing that the infiltration of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (fibrocytes) into the myocardium with ANG II plays a critical role in ECM deposition. hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were not affected (329) ANG II has blood pressure-independent effects on the fibroblast compartment of the heart that are mediated by IL-6. subpressor dose of ANG II (200 ngkg1min1) has been less well studied. AP1 by nox4-induced ROS is implicated in ANG II-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation, migration, and collagen production. proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 has been found to be responsible for ANG II-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation, migration, and collagen production. no protection of cardiac fibrosis was detected in mice infused with ANG II (90) ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is associated with LV diastolic stiffness and isolated LV dysfunction as seen in HFpEF. the increased fibrosis is attributed to increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into the heart. mitochondria may constitute an additional source of ROS for driving fibrosis. c-Src deficiency or pharmacological inhibition was found to attenuate ANG II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and oxidative stress. however, both vascular and cardiac fibrosis are enhanced (111). ANG II-dependent ERK1/2 activation through this pathway increases serum response factor (SRF) activity, leading to increased CTGF production and eventual secretion (777). ANG II-induced p38MAPK activity may be linked to gene expression in myofibroblasts via SRF (213) ANG II-induced expression of the collagen-specific tyrosine kinase receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in cardiac fibroblasts was linked to activation of NF-B by p38MAPK. NF-B/TGF-1/TRIF/TRAF6 pathway protects mice against ANG II-induced atrial fibrosis. NF-B is also part of the SP1/TGF/Smad3 pathway involved in cardiac fibrosis (403, 1134) ANG II-induced MAPK/TGF1/TRAF6 pathway is necessary for CTGF production and proliferation in atrial fibroblasts (341) IL-11 is required for the profibrotic effects of TGF-1 in the heart. IL-11 signals by causing dimerization of the transmembrane glycoprotein 130. upregulation of IL-11 was found to be the dominant transcriptional response of cardiac fibroblasts to TGF-1, which also express its receptor IL-11RA. ANG II-induced fibrosis of the heart was shown to be dependent on the recruitment of bone marrow-derived monocytic fibroblast precursors. these so-called fibrocytes express both hematopoietic (CD45, CD34, and CD133) and mesenchymal markers. prevalence of M1 and M2 was associated with a proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine milieu. evidence was reported that formation of M2 cells was dependent on production of TNF- by M1 cells. ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is dependent on infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages originating from the bone marrow. ANG II-induced expression of IL-6 and collagens in cardiac fibroblasts is dependent on the downregulation of microRNA Let-7i (1124) evidence suggests other routes for macrophage activation by ANG II occur in the heart as well. IL12p35 knockout of IL12p35 leads to polarization of CD4+ T cells to the Th2 phenotype and Th2-dependent accumulation of TGF- expressing M2 macrophages in the heart. ANG II-induced cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation is observed in cocultures with wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages, but not with SGK1-deficient macrophages. production of extracellular heterodimeric proteins S100a8/a9 by CD11b+Gr1+ neutrophils may be an early initiation factor in ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis. blocking S100a8/a9 prevents ANG II infusion-induced cardiac cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and hypertrophy. phenotypes to cardiac fibrosis somewhat unsettled Th1 cells Produce IFN- that induces M CCL2 production to sustain inflammation 352 Polarize M to TGF producing M2 phenotype 585 T cells Produce IL-17A in response to monocyte IL-1 584 IL-17A-induced IL-6 production by cardiac fibroblasts leads to myofibroblast phenotype Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) TIMP3 knockout increases LV passive stiffness due to excess fibrosis. elimination of TIMP3 attenuates the prohypertrophic actions of cardiac fibroblasts on cardiomyocytes. infused Bcl10 knockout mice showed reduced cardiac fibrosis and cellular infiltration. NF-B activation in both cardiac and immune cells contributed to adverse cardiac remodeling by ANG II. delocalization of connexin-43 (Cx43) contributes to ventricular arrhythmias. increased susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia in cardiac hypertrophy independent of structural remodeling. ANG II-induced oxidative activation of CaMKII and PKA via Nox2 likely contributes as well to ventricular arrhythmias due to increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage. hypertension is a major risk factor for AF, which can be attributed to increased cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. human atrial tissue samples of patients with AF also show increased expression of ACE and ERK1/2 along with increased atrial fibrosis (323). fibrosis can slow conduction by interfering with electric continuity (425). elucidating ANG II-dependent mechanisms of AF and how they affect the development of AF is critical. CTGF is upregulated by ANG II through Rac1 in atrial myocytes. ANG II-dependent nox2/4 induction (1215) and nox-derived ROS activates CaMKII. ANG II induces spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. ANG II also enhances promoter methylation leading to decreased protein expression of Pitx2c, a gene involved in AF, through AT1R (457). ANG II in cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most extensively studied mechanisms of ANG II signaling and generally reflects the increase in size of individual cardiac myocytes. concentric hypertrophy reflects the addition of new sarcomeres in parallel to existing sarcomeres. the mouse model of ANG II infusion at a high pressor dose exhibits concentric left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension with a variable contribution of volume overload caused by aortic valve insufficiency. pathological cardiac hypertrophy is also associated with endothelial dysfunction, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and gene compensation with KO, potential experimental immunosuppression or preconditioning with renal transplants could be raised to question the broad applicability of these findings. ANG II can act independently of, or in synergy with, increased blood pressure to induce cardiac hypertrophy (27, 523) ANG II has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vivo. ANG II enhances expression and activation of CIKS in cardiac myocytes. this leads to ERK1/2, calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), PKC-, and CaMKII/MEF2. ANG II infusion and pressure overload is also promoted by the ubiquitin E3 ligase. the ubiquitin E3 ligase, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) mediates signal transduction from members of the TNF receptor superfamily and toll/IL-1 receptor family. ROS, through NADPH oxidase, stimulates CCL2 (MCP1) expression through TLR4 KO mice treated with ANG II are protected from pentoxifylline attenuates cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and diastolic dysfunction in ANG II-infused rats, as well as myocardial macrophage infiltration, NF-B activation, and proinflammatory cytokine expression. ANG II-induced upregulation of osteoprotegerin by cardiac cells, including infiltrating macrophages, was found to protect against eccentric hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. ANG II infusion enhances cardiac Nox4 expression. phospholamban phosphorylation leads to increased SR Ca2+ uptake. ANG II transgene increases mitochondria-derived superoxide and subsequent myocyte apoptosis. no protection of cardiac remodeling was detected in nox4 knockout mice. ANG II-dependent cardiac hypertrophy was unaffected. rhoa, g proteins, and ca2+ were reduced. formin homology 2 domain containing 3 (FHOD3) mediate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by ANG II through a paracrine mechanism involving CTGF and FGF2 (952). ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by ANG II through a paracrine mechanism involving CTGF and FGF2 (952). ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy in part via IP3-mediated Ca2+ release downstream of GPCR signaling. a background Ca2+ entry pathway in cardiac myocytes formed by TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels was implicated in ANG II-induced hypertrophy. TRV120027 activates several kinase pathways via -arrestin coupling. this ligand lowers blood pressure and afterload, and thus preserves cardiac stroke volume. the inotropic actions of -arrestin-biased AT1R ligands may be due to phosphorylation. EGFR signaling enhances ERK1/2 and Akt activation which upregulate cardiac hypertrophy markers including myHC, ANP, BNP, SKA, and/-MyHC (819). EGFR transactivation also elicits downstream ER stress leading to cardiac hypertrophy. endothelial cell-produced endothelin-1 contributes to ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, independently from blood pressure (11) ANG II induces ET-1 expression by activation of c-Jun/c-Fos (AP1) and formation of chromatin remodeling complex that includes AP1-mediated recruitment of a histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase. others report that endothelial tyrosine kin protein 2 (SORBS2) and PDZ and LIM domain 5 (PDLIM5) in cardiac myocytes (52). release of exosomes from cardiac fibroblasts in response to ANG II stimulation may be mediated through both AT1R and AT2R. ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are attenuated in ANG II-infused mice treated with a BMP inhibitor. ANG II increases association of TR3 (also termed Nur77) with the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) TSC1/TSC2 complex. proteasome activation is also implicated in the degradation of ATRAP in the heart in response to ANG II infusion, which seemingly is a contributing factor to AT1R-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy by multiple means involving direct actions on cardiac myocytes. three processes are dominant in cardiac myocytes: canonical signaling, transactivation of EGFR, and inflammatory signaling. the later may involve other cell types as the source of ROS. secreted Nampt from cardiac myocytes, as well as the generation and activation of the immunoproteasome, may also contribute to ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Activated fibroblasts stimulate hypertrophy by releasing FGF-2, fibulin-2, TGF-, and exosomes enriched in passenger strand miR-21*. IL-10 deficiency enhances ANG II-induced gene expression of TNF-, IL-6, and MMP-2/9. anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 deficiency enhances ANG II-induced gene expression of TNF-, IL-6, and MMP-2/9. mice harboring an S727A mutation show less of an increase in heart weight in response to ANG II. this was associated with reduced myofibril number and density, as well as foci of necrotic cardiomyocytes and reparative fibrosis. this suggests that STAT3 may serve an adaptive and protective role in ANG II-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Xirp2 hypomorphic mice infused with ANG II exhibit less hypertrophy, as well as reduced fibrosis and apoptosis. Xirp2 deficiency is associated with basal cardiac hypertrophy. increased GSK3 activity was postulated to attenuate the hypertrophic actions of ANG II due to reduced levels of -catenin. this is at odds with the previously mentioned finding that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response to ANG II infusion. however, this explanation is at odds with the previously mentioned finding that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response to ANG KKs depends on activation of TAK1 (Dusp14) in vivo genetic loss of Dusp14 aggravates, while cardiac-specific Dusp14 overexpression attenuates, aortic banding-induced cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. p38 and JNK signaling may be antihypertrophic (951). IRF3 is activated by ANG II in cardiac fibroblasts via canonical ERK signaling and contributes to cardiac fibrosis. ANG II increases IRF4 leading to upregulation of CREB and hypertrophy-related genes in cardiac myocytes. IL-10 is a biomechanically induced cytokine that is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. IL-33 is a biomechanically induced cytokine that is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. it inhibits ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (908) levels of AT2R in the heart increase with hypertension, MI, and in the failing heart, most likely due to expression by cardiac fibroblasts. overexpression of AT2R is associated with improved contractile function after MI, which may be due to increased levels of NO. myocytes improve contractile function and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy. others report no effect on ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling with high levels of AT2R expression. a strain effect may influence outcome at least with aortic stenosis (41) ACE2, ANG (1\u20137), and Mas in cardiac hypertrophy. loss of ACE2 is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (1261); loss of Mas. ACE2 deficiency exacerbates adverse cardiac remodeling caused by diabetes. endothelial cell deletion of Brg1 or FoxM1 markedly attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling. ANG II in cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most extensively studied mechanisms of ANG II signaling. increased blood pressure causes a concentric pattern of LV hypertrophy. the mouse model of ANG II infusion at a high pressor dose exhibits concentric left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension with a variable contribution of volume overload caused by aortic valve insufficiency. pathological cardiac hypertrophy is also associated with endothelial dysfunction, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and capillary rarefaction. ANG II can act independently of, or in synergy with, increased blood pressure to induce cardiac hypertrophy (27, 523). cardiomyocyte-specific expression of AT1R-associated protein (ATRAP) suppresses development of cardiac hypertrophy, activation of p38MAPK, and induction of hypertrophy-related genes. canonical signaling cascades include ERK1/2, calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), PKC-, and CaMKII/MEF2 (951, 1046) there is ample evidence that the growth-promoting actions of ANG II on cardiac myocytes in vivo are amplified and sustained by the upregulation of an innate immune response and inflammation. TRAF6 expression is increased in human and murine hypertrophied hearts and is induced by ROS, which also stimulates its auto-ubiquitination. this facilitates recruitment of the adaptor protein TAB2 and subsequent binding of TRAF6 to TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) which undergoes ubiquitination and activation thereby initiating JNK1/2/p38 signaling that ostensibly results in cardiac hypertrophy (433). osteoprotegerin is a secretory glycoprotein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily. it acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, but not so in this case. ANG II-induced hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy may also affect cardiac hypertrophy and structural remodeling of the heart. ANG II-induced mitochondrial ROS linked to cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. recent evidence has also highlighted a beneficial role for PPAR in blocking ANG II-induced upregulation of Nox2/Nox4 and nuclear translocation of NF-B p65. x2 knockout mice, ANG II-dependent cardiac hypertrophy was unaffected. cardiac ROS levels were decreased (1059) rhoa, g proteins, and ca2+. the small GTPase RhoA regulates RhoA activation in the heart. cardiac fibroblast ROCK2 may also mediate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by ANG II through a paracrine mechanism involving CTGF and FGF2 (952). G protein-dependent MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-ERK1/2 signaling is also under negative regulation by regulator of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) and RGS5, which attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo from aortic banding or in vitr ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy in part via IP3-mediated Ca2+ release downstream of GPCR signaling (742). Ca2+ contributes to cardiac hypertrophy by several means including activation of NFAT and CaMKII (524, 951) the inotropic actions of -arrestin-biased AT1R ligands may be due to phosphorylation of components of the contractile machinery. AT1R -arrestin-biased signaling leads to MLC2v phosphorylation via the ERK1/2-RSK3 cascade. TRV120027 may be a useful therapeutic agent for treating acute heart failure. EGFR transactivation also elicits downstream ER stress leading to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (465, 1035). ANG II-induced EGFR transactivation is dependent on nox2/Nox4-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 (1236) ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis independently from blood pressure (11). ANG II induces ET-1 expression by activation of c-Jun/c-Fos (AP1) and formation of chromatin remodeling complex that includes AP1-mediated recruitment of a histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase. others report that endothelial tyrosine kinase Bmx and subsequent activation of STAT3 is necessary ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are attenuated in ANG II-infused mice treated with a BMP inhibitor or in cardiac-specific BMP type 1 receptor ALK2-deficient mice. a role for TNF- is emerging in the ANG II response pathway. ANG II increases association of TR3 (also termed Nur77), a member of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor family, with the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) TSC1/TSC2 complex. this in turn activates mTORC1, which increases protein synthesis (1115) Proteasome activation is also implicated in the degradation of ATRAP in the heart in response to ANG II infusion. developments within the last 5 yr are noted in darker text. three processes are dominant in cardiac myocytes: canonical signaling, transactivation of EGFR, and inflammatory signaling. the later may involve other cell types as the source of ROS. endothelial cells release ET-1 and inflammatory cytokines. Activated fibroblasts stimulate hypertrophy by releasing FGF-2, fibulin-2, TGF-, and exosomes that are enriched in passenger strand miR-21*. a number of additional endogenous counterregulatory mechanisms that attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling have recently been identified. IL-10 deficiency enhances ANG II-induced gene expression of TNF-, IL-6, and MMP-2/9, as well as Akt phosphorylation. IL-10 activates Akt/mTORC1 signaling and attenuates ANG II-induced pathological autophagy 500, 528 IRF7 Interferon regulatory factor 7. noncardiomyocyte-targeted STAT3 deletion does not attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, although contractile function was impaired and metabolic homeostasis was disturbed with ANG II treatment. noncanonical STAT3 signaling has been implicated in ANG II-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation (1282) Xirp2 gene of cardiomyocytes is an early direct target of ANG II stimulation via activation of the MEF2A transcription factor. Xirp2 deficiency does not affect ANG II-induced maladaptive cardiac remodeling. cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response to ANG II infusion. however, this explanation is at odds with the previously mentioned finding that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of -catenin in the mouse enhances the hypertrophic response to ANG II infusion. dusp14 knockdown in vitro promotes elevated cardiac hypertrophic gene regulation in response to ANG II. p38 and JNK signaling may be antihypertrophic (951) ERK1/2 signaling, rather than being essential for cardiac hypertrophy, may coordinate concentric and eccentric growth of the heart. ANG II downregulates TIEG1 expression in association with induction of hypertrophy. adiponectin inhibits cardiac hypertrophy in rats infused with ANG II. ANG II also suppresses adiponectin receptor 1 expression. IL-33 is a biomechanically induced cytokine that is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts and attenuates ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (908). ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by suppressing ERK1/2 activation through PKC inhibition and PKA activation (754). KO mice found extrarenal AT1ARs were dispensable for hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy in ANG II has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. at1Rs in cardiac myocytes function in an agonist-independent manner. ANG II has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. ANG II enhances expression of CIKS in cardiac myocytes leading to IKK/NF-B and JNK/AP1 activation and subsequent induction of MMP9 and IL-18, a potent growth factor for cardiac myocytes. this involves induction or activation of a number of growth-promoting/proinflammatory factors, including IFN- (652), IL-18 (1082), NF-B (294, 473), and increased ROS formation due to the engagement of Nox2 secretion of Nampt from cardiac myocytes, which functions extracellularly as a proinflammatory cytokine, may also contribute to ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. ANG II-induced upregulation of osteoprotegerin by cardiac cells, including infiltrating macrophages. osteoprotegerin is a secretory glycoprotein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily that generally acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL. but that was not so in this case (1070) the engagement of adaptive immunity by ANG II may also impact on cardiac hypertrophy and overall structural remodeling of the heart. mitochondrial targeted antioxidant peptide attenuates ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. ANG II-induced mitochondrial ROS that was linked to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis was attributed to reduced SOD2 activity resulting from interference by SIRT4 in SIRT3-mediated SOD2 deacetylation (616) G13 regulates RhoA activation in the heart in response to ANG II (1036) it is linked to activation of myocardin-related transcription factors, cardiac hypertrophy, and eventual heart failure. AKAP-Lbc serves as a GEF for activating RhoA. ERK1/2 signaling is under negative regulation by regulators of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) and RGS5, which attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo from ANG II (564, 603). ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy in part via IP3-mediated Ca2+ release downstream of GPCR signaling (742). a background Ca2+ entry pathway in cardiac myocytes formed by TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels was implicated in ANG II-induced hypertrophy. in contrast, the ca2+-activated cation channel TRPM4 was identified as a negative regulator of ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. AT1R -arrestin-biased signaling leads to MLC2v phosphorylation via the ERK1/2-RSK3 cascade. RSK3 may also couple to activation of SRF and induction of SERCA2 protein expression. TRV120027 may be a useful therapeutic agent for treating acute heart failure. ANG II-induced EGFR transactivation is dependent on nox2/Nox4-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 (1236). ANG II induces ET-1 expression by activation of c-Jun/c-Fos (AP1) and formation of chromatin remodeling complex. ANG II stimulates cardiac fibroblasts to produce FGF-2, which is important for concentric hypertrophy and preventing dilated cardiomyopathy. fibulin-2 is a likely matricellular protein that is upregulated by ANG II and is required in turn for upregulation of TGF-. ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy in vivo through release of exosomes from cardiac fibroblasts that are enriched in passenger strand miR-21*. ANG II-infused mice treated with a BMP inhibitor or in cardiac-specific BMP type 1 receptor ALK2-deficient mice show reduced cardiac hypertrophy (991) a role for TNF- is emerging in the ANG II response pathway. ANG II increases association of TR3 (also called Nur77) with the tuberous sclerosis. proteasome activation is also implicated in the degradation of ATRAP in the heart. ANG II-induced expression of IGF receptor II (IGF-IIR) is attributed to proteasome-mediated degradation of SIRT1 downstream of JNK activation via AT1R. loss of SIRT1 in turn prevents deacetylation of heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). the later may involve other cell types as the source of ROS. a background Ca2+ entry pathway formed by TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels was also implicated in ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. counterregulatory mechanisms have recently been identified (TABLE 7). a number of additional endogenous counterregulatory mechanisms have been identified. IL-10 deficiency increases p38 phosphorylation; IL-10 activates Akt/mTORC1 signaling and attenuates ANG II-induced pathological autophagy 500, 528 IRF7 Interferon regulatory factor 7. heart-specific IRF7 overexpression attenuated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. cardiomyocyte-targeted STAT3 deletion does not attenuate ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. contractile function was impaired and metabolic homeostasis was disturbed with ANG II treatment (28). this is reminiscent of a previous report that global deficiency of either AT1R subtype in the mouse does not affect normal cardiac morphology. Xirp2 gene of cardiomyocytes is an early direct target of ANG II stimulation via activation of the MEF2A transcription factor. hearts of Xirp2 hypomorphic mice infused with ANG II exhibit less hypertrophy, as well as markedly reduced fibrosis and apoptosis. in vitro and in vivo studies positively associate -catenin expression to cardiac hypertrophy. Xirp2 appears to be able to bind -catenin (165), which localizes to adherens junctions in ICD structures. -catenin is not increased in ANG II-treated Xirp2-deficient mice. ANG II-induced ERK1/2 activation in cardiac myocytes downregulates miR-133a levels (582), an event that results in cardiac hypertrophy (120, 244) ERK1/2 signaling, rather than being essential for cardiac hypertrophy, may coordinate concentric and eccentric growth of the heart (951) ANG II downregulates TIEG1 expression in association with induction of hypertrophy. overexpression of adiponectin prevents cardiac hypertrophy in rats infused with ANG II. loss of IL-10 worsens ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, pathological autophagy, and contractile dysfunction. the issue of renin expression in the heart is controversial. the heart has a complete local RAS that generates angiotensin peptides from hepatic or endogenously produced angiotensinogen (861, 1042) most studies have shown increased mortality and impaired cardiac function post-MI with AT2R deletion. however, overexpression of AT2R in cardiac myocytes improves contractile function. overexpression of AT2R in cardiac myocytes improves contractile function. a strain effect may influence outcome at least with aortic stenosis (41) AT2R is reported to couple to cardiac hypertrophy via the transcription factor promyelocytic zinc finger protein (PLZF) with stimulation-induced internalization of AT2R, PLZF localizes in the nucleus and upregulates both GATA4 and p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. 2 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction induced by diabetes (241), myocardial infarction (1266), and ANG II infusion (1268) ANG (1\u20137) infusion was found to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and reduce cardiac fibrosis in pressure-overloaded ACE2 KO mice by suppressing NAD(P)H oxidase activity. thelial cell expression of Brg1 and FoxM1 is increased in human hypertrophic hearts and correlates with the ACE/ACE2 expression ratio. pathological cardiac remodeling is a severe alteration in the structure of the heart due to changes at the molecular and cellular level that impair contractility and heart function. a principal hormone contributing to ECM deposition is ANG II, which has been implicated in both reparative fibrosis of scar tissue that is seen post-MI (835 periostin expression is a more comprehensive marker for activated cardiac fibroblasts. ANG II increases periostin expression in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts directly via a Ras/p38MAPK/CREB signaling pathway. ANG II also increases V/3 and V/5 integrin expression and signaling in rat cardiac fibroblasts. hematopoietic progenitors, endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) were found to have a negligible contribution. ANG II has direct stimulatory actions on cardiac fibroblasts that are profibrotic. a subpressor dose of ANG II (400 ngkg1min1) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury in the heart concomitant with inflammation and the recruitment of macrophages that drive fibrosis. it was recently proposed that chronic infusion of the mouse with low-dose ANG II may serve as a model for studying the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 has been found to be responsible for ANG II-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation, migration, and collagen production. ANG II-induced nox4 activity contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo via Akt/mTOR and NF-B signaling. otypically normal and develop similar cardiac hypertrophy and systolic hypertension with ANG II infusion as wild-type mice. increased fibrosis is associated with LV diastolic stiffness and isolated LV dysfunction. mitochondria may constitute an additional source of ROS for driving fibrosis. c-Src deficiency or pharmacological inhibition was found to attenuate ANG II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and oxidative stress. however, both vascular and cardiac fibrosis are enhanced (111) ANG II causes cardiac fibrosis independent of increased blood pressure. ANG II-induced p38MAPK activity may be linked to gene expression in myofibroblasts via SRF (213) ANG II-induced expression of the collagen-specific tyrosine kinase receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in cardiac fibroblasts was linked to activation of NF-B by p38MAPK. ANG II activates ERK1/2 in cardiac fibroblasts by increased intracellular Ca2+ or PKC- ( azone, a PPAR agonist, protects mice against ANG II-induced atrial fibrosis. NF-B is also part of the SP1/TGF/Smad3 pathway involved in cardiac fibrosis (403, 1134) ANG II-induced MAPK/TGF1/TRAF6 pathway is necessary for CTGF production and proliferation in atrial fibroblasts (341) study showed that IL-11 is required for the profibrotic effects of TGF-1 in the heart. IL-11 signals by causing dimerization of the transmembrane glycoprotein 130. upregulation of IL-11 was found to be the dominant transcriptional response of cardiac fibroblasts to TGF-1, which also express its receptor IL-11RA. ANG II-induced fibrosis of the heart (perivascular and interstitial) was shown to be dependent on the recruitment of bone marrow-derived monocytic fibroblast precursors. recruited fibrocytes expressed both hematopoietic (CD45, CD34, and CD133) and mesenchymal markers (Col-I, SMA, vimentin) the exact identity and function of the myeloid fibrocytes in ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is unclear. ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is dependent on the infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages originating from the bone marrow. ANG II infusion may activate macrophages to cause cardiac fibrosis. the upregulation of the ECM glycoprotein tenascin C by cardiac fibroblasts is implicated in fibrosis ostensibly by enhancing migration and activation of macrophages. IL12p35 knockout M2 macrophages stimulate differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into collagen producing myofibroblasts. ligocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is implicated in macrophage recruitment to the heart. loss of SGK1 attenuates increase in profibrotic cytokines in the heart. production of extracellular heterodimeric proteins S100a8/a9 by CD11b+Gr1+ neutrophils may be an early initiation factor in ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis. blocking S100a8/a9 prevents ANG II infusion-induced cardiac cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. 352 Polarize M to TGF- producing M2 phenotype 585 T cells Produce IL-17A in response to monocyte IL-1 584 IL-17A-induced IL-6 production by cardiac fibroblasts. Recruited/activated by parenchymal cell IFN- 624 Polarize macrophages to M1 phenotype via direct interaction/TCR independent Neutrophils Activate RAGE signaling. loss of TIMP3 knockout increases LV passive stiffness due to excess fibrosis due to posttranslational stabilization and deposition of collagen by matricellular proteins SPARC and osteopontin. elimination of TIMP3 attenuates prohypertrophic actions of cardiac fibroblasts on cardiomyocytes (266) pathological cardiac remodeling is a severe alteration in the structure of the heart. deoxycorticosterone/salt-induced cardiac fibrosis results from activation of the mineralocorticoid receptors of macrophages (867). periostin is a secreted ECM protein that functions in cellular adhesion and migration as a ligand for V/3 and V/5 integrins via its FAS1\u20132 domains (778). a second population of endocardial embryonic origins contributes to fibrosis in the interventricular septum and left ventricular free wall (712). Previously studied sources of cardiac myofibroblasts, namely, circulating hematopoietic progenitors, endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) were found to have a negligible contribution. high-salt diet and high ANG II (>3,000 ngkg1min1), cardiac dysfunction, myocardial inflammation, and fibrosis were prevented by genetic deletion of IL-6. ANG II has blood pressure-independent effects on the fibroblast compartment of the heart that are mediated by IL-6. ANG II-induced nox4 activity contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo. no protection of cardiac fibrosis was detected in mice infused with ANG II. new evidence obtained with transgenic mice indicates a prominent contribution of endothelial cell Nox2 to ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis. the increased fibrosis is associated with LV diastolic stiffness and isolated LV dysfunction as seen in HFpEF. c-Src deficiency or pharmacological inhibition was found to attenuate ANG II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and oxidative stress, as well as improve cardiac and endothelial function. ANG II-dependent ERK1/2 activation through this pathway increases serum response factor (SRF) activity, leading to increased CTGF production and eventual secretion (777) p38MAPK-dependent periostin expression is dependent on RAS-induced p38MAPK activation and downstream CREB (568) ANG II-induced p38MAPK activity may be linked as well to gene expression in myofibroblasts via SRF (213) ANG II-induced expression of the collagen-specific tyrosine kinase receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in cardiac fibroblasts was linked to activation of NF- SOCE activity is associated with increased Smad2/3 phosphorylation. ANG II signals activation of an NF-B/TGF-1/TRIF/TRAF6 pathway in atrial fibroblasts. NF-B is also part of the SP1/TGF/Smad3 pathway involved in cardiac fibrosis (403, 1134) attenuated in mice with PAI-1 deficiency, cardiac hypertrophy was enhanced. BMP-7 was found to stimulate activation of inhibitory Smad6 and reduce TGF- generation and signaling by cardiac myocytes. IL-11 is required for the profibrotic effects of TGF-1 in the heart. AP1 and STAT3 activation and the upregulation of miR-21. ANG II-induced ROS is implicated as well in both canonical and noncanonical TGF- signaling. increased TGF- levels may contribute to ANG II-induced fibrosis. prevalence of M1 and M2 was associated with a proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine milieu. evidence was reported that formation of M2 cells was dependent on production of TNF- by M1 cells. ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is dependent on infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages originating from the bone marrow. ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis is dependent on macrophages and IL-6. activated macrophages stimulate cardiac fibroblasts to produce IL-6. other routes for macrophage activation by ANG II occur in the heart. cells dependent on IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine of two covalently linked p35 and p40 subunits. deletion of IL12p35 leads to polarization of CD4+ T cells to the Th2 phenotype. IL12p35 knockout M2 macrophages can stimulate differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into collagen producing myofibroblasts. recruitment and activation of macrophages by CD8+ T cells does not require IFN-, but does require their physical contact. production of extracellular heterodimeric proteins S100a8/a9 by CD11b+Gr1+ neutrophils may be an early initiation factor in ANG II-induced cardiac fibrosis. the role of TIMP2 and TIMP3 are similarly complicated in ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling. the roles of TIMP2 and TIMP3 are similarly complicated in ANG II-induced cardiac remodeling, with loss of either leading to diastolic dysfunction. Knockout of TIMP2 impairs active relaxation by enhancing ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. cardiac fibrosis is eliminated due to suppressed collagen deposition. elimination of TIMP3 attenuates prohypertrophic actions of cardiac fibroblasts on cardiomyocytes. ANG II-infused mice showed reduced cardiac fibrosis and cellular infiltration. NF-B activation in both cardiac and immune cells contributed to adverse cardiac remodeling by ANG II. reduced Cx43 levels may also contribute to sudden cardiac death. preclinical evidence implicates AT1R in increased susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia. ANG II-induced oxidative activation of CaMKII and PKA via Nox2 likely contributes as well to ventricular arrhythmias. atrial fibrillation (AF) is considered to be the most common sustained type of cardiac arrhythmia. human atrial tissue samples of patients with AF also show increased expression of ACE and ERK1/2 along with increased atrial fibrosis (323). fibrosis can slow conduction by interfering with electric continuity (425) rapid atrial pacing suppresses Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-1. CTGF is upregulated by ANG II through Rac1 in atrial myocytes. ANG II-dependent nox2/4 induction (1215) and nox-derived ROS activates CaMKII. ANG II-induced -SMA expression and ERK1/2-dependent proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts are also dependent on TRPC3. ANG II also enhances promoter methylation leading to decreased protein expression of Pitx2c. s are expressed throughout the kidney in vasculature, tubular epithelial populations and the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), as well as podocytes and mesangial cells in the glomerulus (985). ANG II has a direct effect on renal VSMCs, causing vasoconstriction of afferent and efferent arterioles, resulting in reduced renal blood flow. intrarenal ANG II levels amplify the sensitivity of TGF to reduce GFR. ANG II also has critical nonhemodynamic functions to alter hypertensive renal pathophysiology. oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, mesangial cell growth, and interstitial fibrosis in the kidney. actions of ANG II to affect proximal tubule functions have been long-recognized. ANG II treatment stimulates trafficking of Na+/H+ exchanger (NaPi2) and NHE regulatory factor (NHERF)1 into the proximal tubule brush-border microvilli. a 3-day nonpressor dose of ANG II also increases proximal tubule NHE3 cortical NKCC2 and ENaC (7 ANG II induces NHERF1 interaction with NHE3 and IRBIT. NHERF1 silencing attenuates NHE3 activation in these cells (366) effects on blood pressure are associated with impaired renal sodium reabsorption. ANG II induces PKC-dependent KLHL3 phosphorylation, preventing WNK4 degradation and impaired K+ secretion. direct mechanism may also involve Src and the ERK cascade (717) ANG II infusion increases renal phosphorylation of NKCC2 and SPAK (451, 749) ANG II promotes NCC-dependent sodium reabsorption through WNK4 and SPAK/OSR1-dependent signaling. lack of IFN- in mice prevents ANG II-induced elevations in blood pressure. deficiency of IL-17A reduces proximal transporter activity in response to ANG II (451) cell-specific deletion of AT1AR from principal and intercalated cells of the collecting duct does not affect baseline blood pressure. deletion of AT1AR from both principal and intercalated cells of the collecting duct is associated with an exaggerated blood pressure increase with chronic ANG II infusion. ANG II via AT1R also increases AQP1 expression in renal proximal tubules in vitro and in vivo (91) critical components of these signal transduction pathways include AT1R, WNKs, SPAK, NKCC2, NCC, NHE3, ENaC, and AQP2. future research will hopefully further elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms leading to the development of altered renal function and hypertension elicited by ANG II. ANG II-induced fibrogenesis is also mediated through CTGF, ET-1, COX-2, PAI-1, osteopontin, and various inflammatory effectors. ANG II-induced fibrogenesis is also mediated through CTGF, ET-1, COX-2, PAI-1, osteopontin, and various inflammatory effectors including VCAM-1, IL-6, TNF- and Lox1. lective HIF-1 knockout mice are protected against ANG II-induced hypertension and renal fibrosis. ANG II also enhances stabilization of PAI-1 and COX2 mRNA via PKC-mediated HuR binding to 3\u2032UTR AU-rich destabilization elements in the kidney. ANG II-induced hypertension and renal inflammatory cell infiltration are enhanced in bone marrow AT1AR-deficient mice. IL-6-dependent activation of the renal JAK2 and STAT3 pathway also contributes to ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II signals Jnk and p38 leading to TGF-1 induction. ERK and p38 both induce Smad3 signaling leading to NF-B. ANG II-induced Rho activity also induces NF-B leading to CTGF and HIF-1 expression. AT2R-deficient mice show greater impairment of renal function, glomerular injury, albuminuria, and mortality. with a high-fat diet, AT2R-deficient mice also show enhanced kidney injury with reduced expression of renal ACE2, ANG (1\u20137) and Mas (22). ANG II and aldosterone simultaneously promote proximal Na+ reabsorption by ANG II and distal Na+ reabsorption by aldosterone through SPAK/WNK signaling. in the setting of low Na+ intake, upregulation of renin and ANG II and downstream AT1R activation increases aldosterone secretion. giotensin receptors are expressed throughout the kidney in vasculature, tubular epithelial populations and the juxtaglomerular apparatus. ANG II has a direct effect on renal VSMCs, causing vasoconstriction of afferent and efferent arterioles, favoring sodium reabsorption. increased intrarenal ANG II levels amplify the sensitivity of TGF to reduce GFR. ANG II also has critical nonhemodynamic functions to alter hypertensive renal pathophysiology. ANG II-induced generations of ET-1 and TGF- are considered to be other major mechanisms in ANG II-induced renal pathophysiology (690) actions of ANG II to affect proximal tubule functions have been long-recognized. ANG II treatment stimulates trafficking of Na+/H+ exchanger (NaPi2) and NHE regulatory factor (NHERF)1 into the proximal tubule brush-border microvilli. a 3-day nonpressor dose of ANG II also increases proximal tubule NKCC2 and ENaC (749) ANG II induces NHERF1 interaction with NHE3 and IRBIT. NHERF1 silencing attenuates NHE3 activation in these cells. effects associated with impaired renal sodium reabsorption and reduced abundance of key sodium transporters. ANG II infusion increases renal phosphorylation of NKCC2 and SPAK (451, 749), suggesting a direct mechanism of NKCC2 via WNK kinases. in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, mutations in WNK4 or WNK1 or in either Cullin 3 or Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. ANG II promotes NCC-dependent sodium reabsorption through WNK4 and SPAK/OSR1-dependent signaling. lack of IFN- in mice prevents ANG II-induced elevations in blood pressure. deficiency of IL-17A reduces proximal transporter activity in response to ANG II (451) mechanism of ROMK inhibition by ANG II appears to involve WNK4, SGK1 and c-Src-dependent ROMK phosphorylation (1227) deletion of AT1AR from principal cells of the collecting duct does not affect baseline blood pressure. deletion of AT1AR from both principal and intercalated cells of the collecting duct is associated with an exaggerated blood pressure increase. ANG II via AT1R also increases AQP1 expression in renal proximal tubules in vitro and in vivo (91). critical components of these signal transduction pathways include AT1R, WNKs, SPAK, NKCC2, NCC, NHE3, ENaC, and AQP2. future research will hopefully further elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms leading to the development of altered renal function and hypertension elicited by ANG II. ANG II-induced fibrogenesis is also mediated through CTGF, ET-1, COX-2, PAI-1, osteopontin, and various inflammatory effectors. ANG II-induced fibrogenesis is also mediated through CTGF, ET-1, COX-2, PAI-1, osteopontin, and various inflammatory effectors including VCAM-1, IL-6, TNF- and Lox1. EC-selective HIF-1 knockout mice are protected against ANG II-induced hypertension and renal fibrosis. ANG II also enhances stabilization of PAI-1 and COX2 mRNA. NF-B inhibition also protects against ANG II-induced renal injury. IL-6-dependent activation of the renal JAK2 and STAT3 pathway also contributes to ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II-induced hypertension and renal inflammatory cell infiltration are enhanced in bone marrow AT1AR-deficient mice. ANG II is a well-known instigator of renal fibrosis and inflammation (FIGURE 11) ERK and p38 both induce Smad3 signaling leading to CTGF-dependent collagen expression. ANG II-induced Rho activity also induces NF-B leading to CTGF and HIF-1 expression. AT2R-deficient mice show greater impairment of renal function, glomerular injury, albuminuria, and mortality. with a high-fat diet, AT2R-deficient mice also show enhanced kidney injury with reduced expression of renal ACE2, ANG (1\u20137) and Mas (22). ANG II predominantly affects the proximal tubule (347), whereas the major impact of aldosterone is in the collecting duct. the combined presence of ANG II and aldosterone simultaneously promotes proximal Na+ reabsorption by ANG II and distal Na+ reabsorption by aldosterone through SPAK/WNK signaling. a preponderance of evidence suggests the brain has the capacity for both. recent studies and editorial commentary highlight the controversial nature of this conclusion. the lack of specificity of AT1R antisera (377) remains a limitation in identifying AT1R containing cells in the brain. a mouse carrying a BAC transgene expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) inserted into the AT1AR locus (327) renin-angiotensin regulates arterial pressure through its effects on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and fluid homeostasis. increased activity of the SNS has also been implicated in playing an important role in heart failure (1284) ANG II infusion decreases PPAR DNA-binding activity in the brain. PPAR activation in the brain blunts pressor response to systemically administered ANG II (1223). ANG II injection activates Rho kinase in brain of conscious rabbits. deletion of ANG II production in the SFO in a model of brain RAS overexpression blunts drinking (901) deletion of AT1R in the SFO also impaired the blood pressure response induced by DOCA-salt (381). the dipsogenic response to either increased ANG II production in the brain or DOCA-salt hypertension requires PKC- (178) ANG II-induced ROS production via Rac1-dependent Nox activation in SFO has been implicated in the pressor response and hypertension (1217) both nox2 and nox4 are involved in the acute pressor response to ICV ANG II. patic steatosis induced by high-fat diet is mediated by ER stress in the SFO. selective deletion of AT1R in the SFO blunted the weight loss induced by leptin by impairing sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis (1219). a physiological link between leptin and AT1R signaling in the brain was previously proposed. the study implicates this specific AT1R-containing neuronal population in the response to stress. loss of AT1R decreased inflammation in the hypothalamus, augmented weight gain by increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure. this suggests a complex interplay between the myriad of physiological effects regulated by ANG II/AT1R (223). chronic ANG II activation decreases cognitive function in animals (415) and synaptic plasticity in mice through activation of p38MAPK (202). central neuroinflammation often involves activation of microglial cells. at1R blockade elicits deactivation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. Telmisartan prevents neuroinflammation by suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production from inducible NO synthase. deletion of AT1R inhibited amyloid- protein generation and amyloid plaque formation (599) there have been a few reports indicating a direct correlation between ANG II signaling, stroke susceptibility and patient outcomes. AT2R with C21 accelerated recovery from middle cerebral artery occlusion through a mechanism that may require VEGF upregulation and mTORC1 signaling (661) in wild-type mice, C21 was similarly effective in wild-type mice but had no effect in AT2R-deficient mice (933). this was associated with a protection of neurons and the blood-brain barrier, and a reduction of oxidative stress within the hippocampus (738). ACE is expressed in the subfornical organ (SFO), organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) ACE is expressed at the lowest level of all RAS genes, and its localization remains controversial (737). a similar BAC transgenic mouse driving eGFP from the AT2R promoter has facilitated the identification of neurons expressing this receptor (224). a similar BAC transgenic mouse driving eGFP from the AT2R promoter has facilitated the identification of neurons expressing this receptor. ANG II upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB in catecholaminergic cells. p38MAPK-dependent reduction in voltage-gated K+ current. PPAR activation attenuates central BDNF-induced blood pressure elevation (924) AT1R mediates brain ACE2 inhibition (1167) ACE2 is a known substrate of ADAM17 (534) ACE2 is a known substrate of ADAM17 (534) ACE2 is a known substrate of ADAM17. the mTOR pathway, which responds to nutritional and environmental cues, has been implicated in ANG II signaling in the SFO. treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin does not alter the pressor response to ICV ANG II, but it attenuates ANG II-induced water intake. this suggests some selectivity in the ANG II-dependent response mediated by mTOR. ER stress is also induced in the SFO in response to systemic ANG II infusion. ICV injection of the chemical chaperone TUDCA or SFO-targeted adenoviral delivery of the molecular chaperone GRP78 attenuates ROS production and hypertension. the study implicates this specific AT1R-containing neuronal population in the response to stress. this is consistent with the activation of NMDA-evoked inward currents in PVN neurons induced by ANG II. AT1R is upregulated in glial astrocytes after myocardial infarction. glial-cell specific deletion of AT1R blunted sympathoexcitation in response to myocardial infarction (417). these studies implicate both neuroglial signaling and AT1R expression. increased activity of the SNS has also been implicated in heart failure. lionic blockade attenuates central BDNF-induced blood pressure elevation (924) PPAR activation attenuates pressor and sympathoexcitatory actions of ANG II in the brain by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. ANG II infusion decreases PPAR DNA-binding activity in the brain. the mTOR pathway, which responds to nutritional and environmental cues, has been implicated in ANG II signaling in the SFO. the mTOR pathway, which responds to nutritional and environmental cues, has been implicated in ANG II signaling in the SFO. the mTOR pathway, which responds to nutritional and environmental cues, has been the frequent topic of investigation. selective activation of ANG II production in the SFO is sufficient to stimulate increased fluid consumption, but is insufficient to increase arterial blood pressure. ANG II-induced drinking via SFO may also be regulated by 1- and -adrenergic receptors (1028) the effects of ER stress in the SFO may extend beyond blood pressure. recent studies also implicate AT1R in the SFO as a regulator of systemic metabolism. selective deletion of AT1R in the SFO blunted the weight loss induced by leptin. NMDA-evoked inward currents in PVN neurons induced by ANG II and oxidative stress (1105) study implicates this specific AT1R-containing neuronal population in the response to stress. loss of AT1R in the PVN decreased inflammation in the hypothalamus. ANG II is elevated in animal models of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. it promotes NF-B signaling and alterations in MMP/TIMP ratio. hypertension is an independent risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. ANG II signaling through AT1R promotes neuroinflammation in a mouse model of 5X familial AD. ICV infusion of ANG II impaired cognitive function in 5XFAD mice. this was associated with hippocampal inflammation, oxidative stress and increased amyloid-deposition. AT2R agonism with CGP42112 reduced infarct volume in rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. opposite occurred with AT2R blockade (622). Activation of AT2R with C21 accelerated recovery from middle cerebral artery occlusion. a link between RAS signaling and metabolic disorders was first identified. mice deficient in ACE appear to have increased energy expenditure with reduced fat mass and improved glucose clearance (429) the adipocyte RAS has been implicated in hypertension, obesity, and metabolic disorders. hepatocytes appear to be the major source of systemic AGT regulating blood pressure in both lean and obese mice (996, 997, 1204) hepatocytes appear to be the major source of systemic AGT regulating blood pressure in both lean and obese mice (996, 997, 1204) hepatocytes appear to be the major source of systemic AGT regulating blood pressure. cross-talk between insulin and ANG II (285, 1089) can modulate the final outcome of the action of insulin. ANG II negatively regulates several steps of the insulin-signaling cascade via AT1R (FIGURE 12), including insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR), IR substrate-1 (IRS-1) and activation of Akt by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) ANG II has a powerful metabolic effect on adipose tissue in animal models and human obesity. adipocyte hypertrophy leads to adipocyte hypertrophy associated with dysfunctions of adipose tissue endocrine function, which can lead to metabolic derangements. recent studies have emphasized a role for ANG II in opposing adipogenesis. inhibitory effect of the AT2R was associated with activation of Wnt10b/-catenin signaling (669) ANG II activates different calcium signaling pathways in adipocytes. adipocyte size in obese Zucker rat is reduced following long-term treatment. ANG II signaling improves insulin resistance and glucose hemostasis. obesity and insulin resistance are closely associated with a state of low-grade inflammation in adipose tissues. palmitic acid, a common saturated fatty acid, can stimulate upregulation of local RAS (ANG II secretion and AT1R) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. stimulation of the AT2Rs has been shown to restore adipocyte cell size in high-fat/high-fructose diet-induced insulin resistance in rats (961) adipose tissue synthesizes the (pro)renin receptor, with increased expression in visceral adipose tissue. the binding of renin or prorenin to (pro)renin receptor in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes initiates an intracellular signaling cascade associated with the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. adipose tissue (pro)renin receptor gene deletion on energy balance has been studied in adipose tissue specific mice. deletion of adipocyte-(pro)renin receptor led to an increase in lipid deposition in liver, suggesting lipodystrophy accompanied by liver steatosis (1157). adipose tissue (pro)renin receptor silencing significantly decreases PPAR and Fabp4 expression. ACE inhibitor binding to ACE leads to phosphorylation of ACE at Ser1270 via CK2 and c-Jun-dependent gene regulation in endothelial cells. ACE inhibitor binding to ACE leads to phosphorylation of ACE at Ser1270 via CK2 and c-Jun-dependent gene regulation in endothelial cells (283) cross-activation of PPARs activated via heterodimerization with RAR/RXR. similar results were confirmed in humans, where plasma adiponectin was increased dramatically. adipocyte-derived lipids increase ACE expression via AMPK signaling in macrophages (505) ANG II indirectly causes insulin resistance via induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as by suppression of adiponectin secretion. in states of obesity with insulin resistance cytokines are largely produced by dysfunctional adipocytes. studies into the intracellular mechanisms involved in the anti-adipogenic response of human preadipose cells from omental fat exposed to ANG II revealed a role for the ERK1/2 pathway (297). the AT2R inhibits adipogenic differentiation in murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (669), a major source of adipocyte generation. ANG II/AT1R signaling activates the calcium-dependent protease calpain in the visceral fat microcirculation of the mesentery of rats and mice (922) calpain activity causes inflammatory leukocyte trafficking in the splanchnic microcirculation via upregulation of endothelial expressed cell adhesion molecules. adipocyte production of inflammatory mediators and chemoattractant causes low-grade inflammation in adipose AGT gene silencing in 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly reduced intracellular level of pro-inflammatory adipokines, including MCP1, IL-6, and TNF-. Saa3, which encodes for the acute phase protein-serum amyloid A3, was recently identified as a critical proinflammatory adipokine. mice with adipocyte AT1AR deficiency develop striking adipocyte hypertrophy. white adipose tissue browning could increase energy expenditure and reduce adiposity. blockade of AT1R may be useful for treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. the effects of (pro)renin signaling are different in VAT versus subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) the effects of (pro)renin signaling are linked to the upregulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis in subcutaneous fat promoting a triglyceride (TG)/free fatty acid (FFA) futile cycling. renin receptor silencing significantly decreases PPAR and Fabp4 expression. lipodystrophy phenotype seen in mice deficient in (pro)renin receptor also suggests an important role of (pro)renin receptor in fatty acid trafficking and storage in adipocytes. this indicates that adipose tissue (pro)renin receptor is involved in the development of obesity and its associated complications. adiponectin levels in vitro and in vivo and potentiate the adiponectin-enhancing effect of the PPAR agonist rosiglitazone in ob/ob mice (504) similar results were confirmed in humans, where plasma adiponectin was increased dramatically as a result of ACE inhibition and ARB treatment (1051) study showed ANG II causes DNA damage and telomere-independent acute stress-induced premature senescence as well as telomere attrition-dependent chronic replicative senescence. both mechanisms require AT1R-mediated ROS production in VSMCs (374) ANG II stimulates mTOR pathway by inhibiting TSC1/2. ANG II also inhibits the PGC-1, sirtuin, and Klotho pathways via inhibition of AMPK or stimulation of ROS production. mitochondrial function, metabolic homeostasis, stem cell exhaustion. activation of sirtuins by agonists like resveratrol promotes longevity by inducing physiological adaptations and changes in gene expression that are similar to dietary restriction (372). ANG II-induced vascular inflammation and cell senescence is largely dependent on mitochondrial ROS production. suppression of SIRT1 activity in turn decreases catalase expression resulting in increased intracellular ROS (1173). AT2R-interacting ATIP overexpression attenuates VSMC senescence with upregulation of methyl methanesulfonate-sensitive 2 and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (699). ANG II increases SM22 in VSMC in vitro and in vivo, which attenuates Akt-dependent Mdm2 phosphorylation and p53 degradation leading to VSMC senescence a previous study showed enhanced muscle function in AT1AR KO mice. but these mice showed a decline in muscle reparative capacity following injury. the explanation for the discrepancy between these two studies is currently unknown. downstream phosphorylation inhibition of AMPK/PGC-1 signaling decreases NRF1, TFAM, mitochondrial complex IV activity, and ATP production. Knockdown of PP2C normalized AMPK activity, PGC-1, NRF1, and TFAM levels and blocked ANG II inhibition of autophagy-regulating kinase ULK1 leading to improved mitochondrial biogenesis/recycling/function. sirtuin pathway was originally identified in yeast as a regulator of lifespan (449) sirtuins play an important role in mediating aging and age-related diseases like cancer, inflammation, cardiac function, and cognition. ANG II inhibition suppresses pink/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and impairs angiogenic capacity in endothelial cells (1135) in the mouse, caloric restriction protects against aortic aneurysm formation induced by ANG II. ANG II promotes PGC-1 acetylation thereby inhibiting its cotranscriptional activity. Suppression of SIRT1 activity in turn decreases catalase expression resulting in increased intracellular ROS (1173) ANG II causes skeletal muscle proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome system via elevation of ROS derived by NADPH oxidase as well as mitochondria. losartan was found to combat disuse atrophy in muscle sarcopenia (106) PKD1 KO mice are spared from ANG II-dependent skeletal muscle atrophy. ANG II promotes Akt dephosphorylation and activation of Foxo. AMPK plays a role in mitochondrial maintenance and skeletal muscle homeostasis. induction of inflammatory signaling enhances pathophysiology of various CVDs. monocytes and macrophages play an important role in ANG II-induced hypertension. ANG II-induced hypertension was also attenuated in CCR2 knockout mice. ANG II infusion stimulates proliferation, differentiation, and activation of hematopoietic stem cells (495). the role of immune cell subtypes implicated in ANG II pathophysiology described in the previous sections are summarized in TABLE 9. many strategies used remove a specific subset of immune cells. it may be difficult to conclude if the outcomes are due to ANG II signal transduction in the immune cell. many of the strategies utilized remove a specific subset of immune cells. 4.7 cells by ANG II causes both NF-B and AP1 activation, ROS production, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. AT1R-dependent IL-6 production has been confirmed in rat lung macrophage-derived cell line, NR8383 (763) macrophage AT1R-mediated Nox2-dependent ROS production in perivascular macrophages contributed to cognitive dysfunction associated with hypertension in mice. RANTES knockout mice have blunted vascular leukocyte infiltration in response to ANG II (698) knockout of T cells as well as Nox2 inactivation is protective from ANG II-induced thrombus formation (936) ANG II-induced vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertension were attenuated in mice (684) renal denervation experiments suggest the importance of renal sympathetic nerve stimulation in ANG II-induced T cell infiltration and end organ damage. CD4+ T helper cells are subset of T cells important for adaptive immune responses. CD8/ mice are protected from ANG II-induced hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular remodeling (1066). in CD4-Cre mediated Tcell MR knockout mice, ANG II-induced hypertension and CD8+ cell accumulation in the kidney were blunted. mice lacking Tbox are protected from ANG II-induced vascular injury. depression of NK-cells by NK1.1 antibody injection protected mice from vascular dysfunction in response to ANG II infusion. ANG II infusion significantly increased rat microbiota Fimicutes/Bacteroides ratio. minocycline significantly lowers ANG II-elevated blood pressure in rats. absence of microbiota in germfree mice protects from ANG II-induced vascular ROS production and hypertension. ANG II signaling in dendritic cells has been shown to activate dendritic cells via NF-B activation (145) ANG II induces IL-23 by in dendritic cell /natural killer cell coculture system. ANG II-induced dendritic cell activation has been demonstrated to contribute to hypertension via ANG II-induced T cell proliferation and activation (498). CD70 mediates formation of memory T cells, and CD70/ mice are protected from effector memory T cell accumulation, hypertension, and renal damage. ANG II-induced albuminuria and glomerular injury, but not hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy, was worsened in CCL5-deficient mice. IL-4 contributes to cardiac fibrosis induced by ANG II, but has no effect on hypertension induced by ANG II (815) IL-17 knockout mice show increased albuminuria, glomerular injury, and renal infiltration compared with wild-type mice. IL-17 knockout mice show increased albuminuria, glomerular injury, and renal infiltration. ANG II signals in B lymphocytes play an important role in ANG II-induced blood pressure elevation and aortic macrophage accumulation and TGF- expression. infusion of ANG II in B cell replenished ApoE/ Baffr/ mice unexpectedly prevented the progression of atherosclerosis (830) f2 nuclear translocation and heme oxygenase 1 expression in neutrophils are crucial for ANG II-induced aortic dissection (525), cardiac fibrosis (1162), and atrial fibrillation (885). ACE knockout mice and mice treated with ACE inhibitor are more susceptible to bacterial infection. the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline has provided new recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication. prevalence of hypertension will increase to 45.6% from 31.9%, and antihypertensive medication will be recommended for 36.2% of adults in the united states (724) the role of ANG II in fetal development and genetic/epigenetic programing impacts on adult-onset cardiovascular disease is an emerging area of study. a systems biology and bioinformatics approach that integrates elements of genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is likely to reveal novel, as yet unimagined, aspects of ANG II signal transduction. no conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors."}
