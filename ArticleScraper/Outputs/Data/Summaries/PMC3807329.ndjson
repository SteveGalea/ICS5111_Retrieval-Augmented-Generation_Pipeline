{"summary": "arenavirus Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic in western africa from Senegal to Cameroon. it causes several hundred thousand infections per year with high mortality. there is currently no vaccine available, and therapeutic intervention is limited to intensive care and the use of ribavirin, which shows some efficacy when given early in the disease. GP1 binds to cellular receptors (11), whereas GP2 mediates viral fusion. GP2 mediates viral fusion and structurally resembles other class I viral fusion proteins (12, 13). the first cellular receptor discovered for LASV was dystroglycan (DG) entry receptor for arthropod-borne bunyaviruses of the genus Phlebovirus in human DCs. DC-SIGN was found to directly bind to high-mannose glycans on phlebovirus GPs. it is crucial for attachment and subsequent internalization, leading to productive infection. mouse MAb B-5-1-2 anti-tubulin, rabbit anti-goat IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to PE. recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) were obtained from Gibco. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human blood obtained from healthy volunteers. blood samples or buffy coats were diluted to 2 to 4 times the volume in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA Ultrapure (Gibco) and transferred in leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH) monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells were obtained by culturing CD14+ monocytes in RPMI 1640 medium plus GlutaMax (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin), 100 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 50 ng/ml IL-4 for 3 to 5 days. expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) pseudotyped with VSV G protein (rVSVG*-VSVG) has been reported previously (38, 39). titers were determined as previously described (40). uUKV production, purification, and titration were performed in mammalian BHK-21 cells. binding of virus to DC-SIGN\u2013Fc and DG-Fc fusion proteins was immobilized in microtiter plates for 2 h. nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin in PBS. bound viruses were detected with MAb 83.6 (20 g/ml) in 1% (wt/vol) BSA-PBS. the reaction was quenched by adding cold 50 mM (final concentration) glycine, pH 8.0, for 10 min. the virus was dialyzed against PBS; infectivity was checked by immunofocus assay (IFA) on veroE6 cells. only biotinylated virus retaining >50% infectivity was used in experiments. Raji and B-THP-1 cells were seeded in round-bottom 96-well plates. they were pretreated for 30 min in the presence of mannan, anti-DC-SIGN antibodies and 5 mM EDTA/EGTA at the indicated concentrations at 37\u00b0C. unbound virus was removed by washing the cells. rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV (MOI, 3) were added to cells on ice for 1 h. unbound virus was removed by washing with cold medium, followed by addition of prewarmed medium and incubation at 37\u00b0C. infection was detected by intracellular staining of LCMVNP. MDDC were seeded in round-bottom 96-well plates (Costar) and pretreated for 30 min. the cells were then infected in the presence of inhibitors for 1 h with rLCMV-LASVGP, UUKV, and rLCMV-VSVG at 37\u00b0C. at 4 h postinfection, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added to prevent secondary infection. mouse MAb M5E2 anti-CD14-PE were from BD Pharmingen. purified polyclonal goat IgG anti-human Axl (hAxl), MAb 125518 anti-hMer-PE, MAb 96201 anti-hDtk-PE, MAb 120507 anti-DC-SIGN, and MAb DC28 anti-DC-SIGNR were from R&D Systems. recombinant DG fused to human IgG Fc (DG-Fc) was produced. PBMCs were isolated from human blood obtained from healthy volunteers. blood samples or buffy coats were diluted to 2 to 4 times the volume. the red blood cells were lysed using a sterile ACK lysis buffer. the cells were washed once with PBS-EDTA, and centrifuged for 10 min. the cells were washed again with PBS-EDTA, and centrifuged for 3 to 4 min. the recombinants rLCMV-LASVGP and rLCMV-VSVG have been described elsewhere (36, 37). the chimera rLCMV-LASVGP has been classified as a biosafety level 2 pathogen for use in cell culture. cells were washed twice in FACS buffer and labeled with secondary antibodies for 45 min on ice in the dark. the cells were fixed with 1/10 CellFix solution for 10 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. the optical density at 405 nm (OD405) was recorded in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. purified virus was dialyzed against reaction buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and reacted twice with 1 mM NHS-X\u2013biotin (Calbiochem) for 20 min on ice. the cells were resuspended in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde-PBS with 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM CaCl2 and fixed for 20 min on ice. after three wash steps, the cells were fixed with FITC-conjugated streptavidin for 45 min in the dark. cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in round-bottom 96-well plates. infection was assessed after 16 h by flow cytometry. rLCMV-LASVGP and rLCMV-VSVG were infected. membranes were incubated with 1 to 10 g/ml primary antibody in 3% (wt/vol) skim milk-PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C or 2 h at RT. secondary antibodies coupled to HRP were applied at 1:6,000 in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) rLCMV-LASVGP has been used extensively to study LASV cell entry and cell tropism in cultured cells in vitro and in vivo. the chimera rLCMV-LASVGP does not show significant attenuation in vitro compared to the parental LCMV strain and grows to robust titers. primary human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors. differentiation of monocytes into MDDC resulted in upregulation of DC-SIGN, as detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. expression in monocytes and MDDC by flow cytometry (Fig. 2) and Western blotting. primary human monocytes express low levels of Dtk, but none of the TAM receptors was detected in MDDC. MC and MDDC were infected with rLCMV-LASVGP at a high MOI of 3. at indicated time points, supernatants were collected and infectious virus titers were determined by IFA. virions stripped with high levels of salt and untreated control virus were incubated with C-terminal fusion proteins of recombinant DG, known to bind GP1 and DC-SIGN with human IgG Fc. the presence of mannose glycans in the viral glycoproteins was detected with the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) recombinant DC-SIGN\u2013Fc, DG-Fc, MAb 83.6 to LASV GP2 were added. rLCMV-LASVGP was immobilized and subjected to treatment with endoH glycosidase for 12 h at room temperature. the binding of DC-SIGN to mannose-rich glycans present on pathogens critically depends on divalent cations. the binding of DC-SIGN to glycans present on pathogens can be blocked by the sugar polymer mannan and MAb DC28 to DC-SIGN (20, 22, 23, 25, 28) as a control, the effect of inhibitors on virus binding to DG-Fc was examined. DC-SIGN mediates attachment of rLCMV-LASVGP to human DCs. rLCMV-LASVGP was purified over a Renografin gradient. rLCMV-LASVGP was labeled with biotin using reagent NHS-X\u2013biotin. DC-SIGN is an attachment factor for rLCMV-LASVGP in MDDC. unbound virus was removed, the cells were fixed, and bound virus was detected with streptavidin labeled with Alexa 488. the data are means SD of three experiments with different donors. DC-SIGN facilitates cell entry of rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV. cells were pretreated with the DC-SIGN ligand mannan. at 4 h postinfection, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added to avoid secondary infection. MDDC treated with 25 g/ml mannan (Man 25), 100 g/ml mannan (Man 100), 25 g/ml GlcNac(1-2)Man (GlcNAc 25), 100 g/ml GlcNac(1-2)Man (GlcNAc 100), and PBS vehicle control (Control) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were then infected with rLCMV-LASVGP (LASV lectin LSECtin can be present on MDDC under some conditions (50) cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of the LSECtin ligand GlcNac(1-2)Man. treatment of MDDC with up to 100 g/ml GlcNac(1-2)Man did not affect infection with the two viruses. rLCMV-LASVGP and uUKV were transfected with wild-type DC-SIGN and a mutant containing a mutation in the cytoplasmic LL motif that is impaired in endocytosis (34). rLCMV-LASVGP and uUKV were infected with rLCMV-LASVGP and uUKV. differences in ability to infect DC-SIGN+ cells may reflect distinct roles of the lectin in mediating cell entry of these viruses. differences in their abilities to infect DC-SIGN+ cells may reflect distinct roles of the lectin in mediating cell entry of these viruses. DC-SIGN accelerates the capture of free rLCMV-LASVGP. cells were pretreated with MAb DC28 to DC-SIGN. rLCMV-LASVGP was then added at an MOI of 10. rLCMV-LASVGP enters MDDC via a slow actin-dependent pathway. both viruses require a pH of 6.0 for fusion, indicating delivery to late endosomes for productive cell entry. rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV were incubated with rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV at an MOI of 3 for 1 h in the cold. unbound virus was removed, and cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C. at the indicated time points, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added and left throughout the experiment. cells infected with rVSVG*-VSVG started to show signs of activation. infection was normalized by setting untreated specimens at 100%. data are means SD of three experiments with three different donors. rLCMV-LASVGP infection in MDDC was performed with nocodazole (10 M) or solvent control (0). treatment of MDDC with up to 8 M CPZ did not significantly affect infection with rLCMV-LASVGP but reduced infection of rVSVG*-VSVG in. rLCMV-LASVGP cell entry was not affected by up to 100 M dynasore. as a control, we again included rVSVG*-VSVG. the actin dependence and apparent clathrin and dynamin independence suggested a possible role of macropinocytosis in the process. rLCMV-LASVGP has been used extensively to study LASV cell entry and cell tropism in cultured cells in vitro and in vivo. rLCMV-LASVGP showed marked tropism for DCs in vitro and in vivo and showed a tissue distribution reminiscent of that of LASV in human patients. rLCMV-LASVGP chimera represents a powerful BSL2 surrogate for studies on LASV-receptor interaction and cell entry monocytes and MDDC were infected at different multiplicities. infection was detected by immunostaining for the intracellular viral nucleoprotein (NP) and quantification by flow cytometry. compared to monocytes, MDDC showed increased susceptibility to rLCMV-LASVGP. the indicated markers were detected by immunostaining on live, nonpermeabilized cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. monocytes and MDDC differentiated as in panel A were lysed. the data are means SD of three experiments with different donors. Fig 2. MDDC lack the TAM receptors Axl, Dtk, and Mer. DG-Fc, DC-SIGN\u2013Fc and DC-SIGN\u2013Fc were detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in a color reaction. the presence of mannose glycans in the viral glycoproteins was detected with the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and GNA with HRP-linked streptavidin in a color reaction. binding of DC-SIGN to rLCMV-LASVGP is blocked by mannan, EDTA/EGTA, and MAb DC28. rLCMV-LASVGP was added at 107 PFU/ml in the presence of inhibitors for 2 h in the cold. rLCMV-LASVGP was immobilized and pretreated with mannan, EDTA/EGTA, and MAb DC28, followed by incubation with rLCMV-LASVGP in the presence of inhibitors. as a control, the effect of inhibitors on virus binding to DG-Fc was examined. rLCMV-LASVGP was purified over a Renografin gradient. biotinylated virus was tested for infectivity. only preparations that retained >50% infectious-virus titers were used. biotinylated rLCMV-LASVGP was added to monocytes, MDDC, and Jurkat cells at the indicated particle/cell ratios for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. unbound virus was removed, the cells were fixed, and bound virus was detected with streptavidin labelled with Alexa 488. cells were pretreated with the DC-SIGN ligand mannan, followed by infection with rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV. at 4 h postinfection, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added to avoid secondary infection. blocking with mannan resulted in only mild reduction (30%) of infection. the cells were then infected with rLCMV-LASVGP (LASV) and UUKV at an MOI of 3 for 1 h in the presence of inhibitors. the cells were washed, and at 4 h postinfection, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added to prevent secondary infection. treatment of MDDC with up to 100 g/ml GlcNac(1-2)Man did not affect infection with the two viruses. pretreatment with 100 g/ml GlcNac(1-2)Man significantly reduced infection with rLCMV-LASVGP. negligible levels of DC-SIGN made them refractory to rLCMV-LASVGP and UUKV. parental Raji cells, Raji-DC-SIGN, and Raji-DC-SIGN-LL expressed similar amounts of DC-SIGN on their surfaces. Raji parental cells, Raji-DC-SIGN, and Raji-DC-SIGN-LL cells were stained with MAb 120507 to DC-SIGN combined with a PE-conjugated secondary antibody. at 4 h postinfection, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added to avoid secondary infection. conditioned cell culture supernatants from panel A were assessed for infectious-virus titers by IFA as for Fig. 1D. DC-SIGN accelerates the capture of free rLCMV-LASVGP by MDDC. rLCMV-LASVGP enters MDDC via a slow actin-dependent pathway. the viruses require a pH of 6.0 for fusion, indicating delivery to late endosomes for productive cell entry. unbound virus was removed, and the cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C. after 16 h, 20 mM ammonium chloride was added and left throughout the experiment. infection was detected as for Fig. 6; data are means SD of three experiments. infection was normalized by setting untreated specimens at 100%. data are means SD of three experiments with three different donors. rLCMV-LASVGP infection was assessed as for panel B. cytochalasin D, latrunculin A, and jasplakinolide significantly reduced infection by rLCMV-LASVGP, but not UUKV. previous studies revealed that UUKV associates in MDDC with clathrin-coated pits. rLCMV-LASVGP was not affected by up to 100 M dynasore. treatment of cells with the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor EIPA reduced infection with rLCMV-LASVGP, but only at relatively high concentrations. IPA-3 plays a central role in macropinocytosis of some viruses. SIGN in MDDC correlated with stronger virus attachment and enhanced productive infection. previous studies on the role of DC-SIGN in entry of rLCMV-LASVGP showed that these viruses bind to DC-SIGN via high-mannose N-glycans present on their glycoproteins (28). rLCMV-LASVGP contains a high proportion of mannose sugars (57), similar to the glycoproteins of arthropod-borne viruses. in early LASV infection, the virus infects DCs at the site of inoculation. the kinetics of free-virus capture by DCs may therefore be an important determinant of efficient productive infection. we provide the first evidence that DC-SIGN can accelerate the capture of free virus by MDDC. rLCMV-LASVGP entry into MDDC suggests an entry pathway related to macropinocytosis that is constitutively active in MDDC. the partial independence of rLCMV-LASVGP entry from DC-SIGN suggests the existence of additional LASV entry factors in MDDC. in-depth characterization of the posttranslational modification of DG in human DCs. potential role as an entry factor for LASV is under way in our laboratory."}
