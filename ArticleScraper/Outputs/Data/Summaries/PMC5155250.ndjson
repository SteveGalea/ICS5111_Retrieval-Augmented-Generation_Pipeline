{"summary": "study of the gut microbiome includes characterization of differences in microbiota composition in states of health or disease, effects of diet or therapeutics on the gut microbiota (32) and metagenomics-based studies of the gut microbiome to investigate the pool of putative gene functions (11) the gut microbiome exerts effects locally and distally via mechanisms such as generated metabolites (38) or induced immunoregulatory responses. administration of products derived from specific bacterial species, including those considered to be probiotic, can lead to an expansion in relative numbers of regulatory T cells. similar sampling concerns have been ascribed to analysis of stool specimens for inferring variability in microbiome biology from different sections of the lower GI tract. study of human lung transplant recipients identified markedly higher bacterial burden in lung allografts compared with nontransplant control lungs. studies of the gut microbiome have included characterization of differences in microbiota composition in states of health or disease, effects of diet or therapeutics on the gut microbiota (32) and metagenomics-based studies of the gut microbiome to investigate the pool of putative gene functions (11) the indigenous gut microbiota is associated with altered immune responses, decreased gut peristalsis, lower body temperature (36), altered sleep\u2013wake cycle (37), changes in serum cholesterol (38), and increased susceptibility to infection. the gut microbiome exerts effects both locally and distally via mechanisms such as generated metabolites (38) or induced immunoregulatory responses. differences in lower airway microbiota composition have been noted between healthy subjects and those with obstructive lung diseases like asthma and COPD (17, 19) similar sampling concerns have been ascribed to analysis of stool specimens for inferring variability in microbiome biology from different sections of the lower GI tract. studies have recently begun to apply fungal microbiome analysis to the upper respiratory tract and to the lungs. key questions and challenges may be organized into three areas: clinical, technological and analytical, and translational. microbiome research in lower lung specimens is important. but finding such microbiota in lower lung specimens alternatively could imply a lower burden of true colonization. prior evidence of pathogenic roles for specific microbial infections is strongest in diseases like CF, COPD, and asthma. unintentional introduction of microorganisms from environmental sources can lead to their identification by these technologies. amplification by PCR is a common step in current techniques to profile bacterial communities. there are no robust ways of estimating power and significance calculation. translating findings about the composition of lung microbiota into knowledge about their behavior and role in health or disease will require additional approaches. determining how to cultivate as yet uncultured organisms would facilitate further characterization about the genetics and function of specific bacterial species of interest. a number of issues were identified as most important to address for the future of lung microbiome research. observational studies are necessary to continue to build knowledge about the types, abundance, and distribution of microbial populations throughout the human respiratory tract. useful methodologies would include ways to study lung microbial burden and measure relevant biomarkers of the microbiome in airway samples collected in a minimally invasive manner. techniques that could characterize the metabolic state of existing microorganisms in the lung microbiome would be useful. prior evidence of pathogenic roles for specific microbial infections is strongest in diseases such as CF, COPD, and asthma. how described heterogeneity in microbial community composition in the lungs relates to clinical manifestations of disease is unclear. a distinct but also clinically relevant question is whether microbiome techniques might enhance understanding and diagnosing specific infections. amplification by PCR is a common step in current techniques to profile bacterial communities. in sequencing experiments, primers targeting one of the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene are used. the amount of data generated from high-throughput sequencing methods presents formidable challenges in analysis. translational Ultimately, translating findings about the composition of lung microbiota into knowledge about their behavior and role in health or disease will require additional approaches. determining how to cultivate as yet uncultured organisms would facilitate further characterization about the genetics and function of specific bacterial species of interest. a number of issues were identified as most important to address for the future of lung microbiome research. these issues are important to consider when designing and performing lung microbiome studies. observational studies are necessary to continue to build knowledge and reference about the types, abundance, and distribution of microbial populations. research on the gut\u2013lung axis and the potential role that gut microbial populations might play in the development of respiratory disease. this might include metabolic disturbances or autoimmune mechanisms that affect airway health. effective use of animal studies and other models to further develop mechanistic understanding of respiratory microbiome\u2013host interactions.
