{"summary": "piglets with high and low levels of maternal M. hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae at 7 d of age. piglets with high and low levels of maternal M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI failed to show vaccine-induced AMI responses. piglets vaccinated in the face of MDI have suppressed antibody responses to M. hyopneumoniae[12], Bordetella bronchiseptica[13], Pseudorabie [14], Swine Influenza Virus [15,16], and Classical Swine Fever. maternal derived CMI that is transferred to neonates across the placenta or in colostrum clearly participates in the neonatal CMI response. transfer of functional tuberculin-specific immune cells, as evidenced by delayed-type hypersensitivity, has been demonstrated in infants from vaccinated mothers. piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI failed to show vaccine induced AMI responses. piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI developed primary and secondary M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses. experimental vaccination of sows increased M. hyopneumoniae-specific AMI responses in blood and colostrum. colostral mononuclear cells (CMC) from experimentally vaccinated sows showed significantly greater M. hyopneumoniae-specific proliferation compared to nonvaccinated sows. black bars represent vaccinated sows; gray bars represent nonvaccinated sows; white bars represent sows pre-vaccination; n = 10/group. piglets from vaccinated sows had significantly greater M. hyopneumoniae antibody S:P ratios compared to piglets from nonvaccinated sows. there was no difference in M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody S:P ratios or lymphoproliferation relative to piglet treatment group prior to piglet vaccination. piglet response to vaccination M. hyopneumoniae vaccine was administered when piglets were 7 d of age. piglets were vaccinated at 7 d of age in an attempt to stimulate endogenous immunity. M. hyopneumoniae specific antibody S:P ratios were measured in piglet blood 7 days post vaccination (panel A) and 14 dpv (panel B) piglets had greater M. hyopneumoniae antibody S:P ratios compared to Vs Vp piglets 14 dpv (p = 0.05). vaccinated piglets proliferated significantly more in response to stimulation with M. hyopneumoniae compared to BMC isolated from nonvaccinated piglets at 14 dpv. there was no difference in proliferation by BMC isolated from Ns Vp piglets at 14 dpv. in control DTH tests, piglets across treatment groups responded to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and none responded to saline at both injection times (7 dpv and 14 dpv; data not shown) M. hyopneumoniae-specific DTH lesions were detected in some piglets across all treatment groups at both time points. piglets were DTH tested at one time point only; n = 10/group. sow response to vaccination Prior to experimental vaccination, sows had M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibodies. M. hyopneumoniae specific AMI and CMI were measured in sow blood and colostrum. black bars represent vaccinated sows; gray bars represent nonvaccinated sows. white bars represent sows pre-vaccination; n = 10/group. blood mononuclear cells (BMC) isolated from piglets of vaccinated sows proliferated significantly more. there was no difference in M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody S:P ratios or lymphoproliferation relative to piglet treatment group prior to piglet vaccination. yopneumoniae vaccine was administered when piglets were 7 d of age. piglets were vaccinated in an attempt to stimulate endogenous immunity. piglets were vaccinated at 7 d of age in an attempt to stimulate endogenous immunity. yopneumoniae specific antibody S:P ratios were measured in piglet blood 7 days post vaccination (panel A) and 14 dpv (panel B) using the Idexx HerdCheckTM ELISA. proliferative responses to concanavalin A (conA) were detected from BMC across piglets at both 7 dpv and 14 dpv. BMC isolated 14 dpv from Vs Vp piglets proliferated more in response to stimulation with M. hyopneumoniae than BMC isolated from the same group of piglets at 7 dpv. piglets across treatment groups responded to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) M. hyopneumoniae-specific DTH lesions were detected in some piglets across all treatment groups at both time points. Vs Vp piglets had significantly larger M. hyopneumoniae-specific DTH lesions (mean orthogonal diameter) compared to all other treatment groups at 7 dpv (p 0.01; Figure 5A) piglet treatment groups are as follows: Ns Np: nonvaccinated sow, nonvaccinated piglet; Vs Vp: vaccinated sow, vaccinated piglet; Vs Np: vaccinated sow, nonvaccinated piglet; Vs Np: vaccinated sow, nonvaccinated piglet. Different subscripts represent significance at p 0.05. neonatal piglet M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI priming and anamnestic responses induced by vaccination are not inhibited by passive interference with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI. there is no evidence that piglets vaccinated in the face of MDI developed active M. hyopneumoniae-specific AMI responses within 14 dpv. test used lacked isotype specificity and IgG likely overshadowed any IgM response in all samples tested. the data in this report represent field conditions. it is unclear why M. hyopneumoniae vaccination is one of the most commonly used vaccines across swine farms. the current study shows that piglets with MDI respond to M. hyopneumoniae vaccination with antigen specific CMI responses. unlike previous studies, we show evidence of CMI stimulation in vivo. piglets with pseudorabies virus developed virus-specific proliferative responses. piglets vaccinated against SIV [16] or CSF [38] do not experience CMI stimulation after vaccination when levels of antigen-specific maternal antibodies are low. piglets with MDI specific for and vaccinated against pseudorabies shed less virus when vaccine was administered intranasally compared to intramuscularly [39] neonatal mice vaccinated against measles virus showed greater measles-specific CMI responsiveness (IFN- production and lymphoproliferation) compared to neonatal mice vaccinated against measles but without virus-specific MDI. these studies suggest that MDI plays a role in the vaccine-induced CMI response detected in neonates. maternal microchimerism persists into adulthood. it is unclear for how long maternal cells are functional in the offspring. piglets developed M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses when vaccinated. replacement gilts were vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae (Myco Silencer, Intervet, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) at days 17 and 45 of gilt acclimatization by farm staff; the total acclimatization period was 110 days. randomly selected piglets from the farm were tested for M. hyopneumoniae-specific PCR testing was performed using a previously described protocol. eighty piglets (n = 3 per sow) were chosen based on sow vaccination status. 20 piglets from nonvaccinated sows were selected randomly and immunized with the same vaccine as given to the sows. piglet blood was diluted 1:2 in sterile PBS prior to layering on lymphocyte separation media to improve cell recovery yield. viability of blood mononuclear cells was at least 95% and viability of colostral mononuclear cells was at least 90%. experimental, negative, and positive controls were analyzed for each animal. cells were transferred to sterile Facs tubes and washed. proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry using a flow cytometer. antibody measurement M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibodies were measured in all blood and colostrum samples using Idexx ELISA kits (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA) the Idexx kit is isotype non-specific. piglet vaccination and sow vaccination were the two factors. comparisons found to be significant by ANOVA. piglet vaccination and sow vaccination were the two factors. an equal number of gilts and first parity sows were randomly stratified into one of two groups. boosted or primed animals were not vaccinated as part of this study. experimental vaccination was against M. hyopneumoniae. blood collection occurred at 5 weeks prepartum and 3 weeks postpartum. colostrum was collected from all sows within 2 hrs of farrowing. teats were scrubbed with alcohol wipes and gloves were worn to minimize sample contamination. cells were resuspended in RPMI and washed with RPMI. cells were plated in duplicate at 5105 cells/well in 200 l. mononuclear cell isolation and stimulation Mononuclear cells were isolated from sow and piglet blood via Ficoll density centrifugation. piglet blood was diluted 1:2 in sterile PBS prior to layering on lymphocyte separation media to improve cell recovery yield. viability of blood mononuclear cells (BMC) was at least 95%. nonstimulated and ConA (5 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) stimulated cultures served as negative and positive controls. experimental, negative, and positive controls were analyzed for each animal. proliferation was analyzed using a flow cytometer. 0.1 ml physiological saline and 0.1 ml physiological saline were used as positive and negative controls. injection sites were clearly marked with livestock paint. Piglets were subject to DTH testing only once. the effect of piglet vaccination on M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody S:P ratios, M. hyopneumoniae-specific proliferation, and M. hyopneumoniae-specific DTH lesion size was analyzed by the student t-test. comparisons found to be significant by ANOVA (p 0.05) were analyzed by the student t-test.
