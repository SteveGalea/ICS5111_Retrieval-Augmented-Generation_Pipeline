{"summary": "pertussis like illness (PLI) refers to a clinical syndrome compatible with pertussis infection but lacking laboratory confirmation or an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. results A total of 131 patients were enrolled in this study. the majority (95.4% [125/131] were infants. the term pertussis like illness (PLI) has been widely used as a clinical diagnosis in children presenting with symptoms and signs compatible with pertussis without history of exposure to a confirmed case. the culture is highly specific, but sensitivity is often limited by inadequate specimen collection, prior use of antibiotics, and transport procedures. in both centers, patients with mild to moderate illness were admitted to the general ward. those requiring close monitoring and assisted oxygenation or noninvasive ventilation were placed in the high dependency unit (PICU) the children with hemodynamic instability or requiring invasive ventilation were placed in the high dependency unit. influenza A, influenza A (H1N1), influenza B, coronaviruses NL63, 229E and HKU1, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus A and B, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, and mycoplasma pneumonia. the majority (60.3%) of infants were females. the vaccination status of two patients in the positive group was unknown. there were no confirmed infections in those who had completed their vaccinations. 3 (5.0) 3 (5.0) 12 years 1 (0.7) - - 1 (1.6) 25 years 4 (3.0) - 3 (5.0) 1 (1.6) 513 years 1 (0.7) - 1 (1.6) 513 years 1 (1.6) - 1 (1.6) 513 years 1 (0.7) - 1 (1.6) - 1 (1.6) - 1 (1.6) - Admitting center Royal Hospital 71 (54.1) 9 (75.0) 29 (49.1) 33 2 (16.6) 13 (22.0) 12 (20.0) Clinical criteria Paroxysms of coughing 121 (92.3) 12 (100.0) 54 (91.5) 55 (91.6) 0.579 Inspiratory whoop 9 (6.8) 2 (16.6) 5 (8.4) 2 (3.3) 0.201 Posttussive vomiting 62 (47.3) 4 (33.3) 29 (49.1) 29 (48.3) 0.593 Apnea 61 (46.5) 8 (66.6) 26 (44.0) 27 (4 over half (56.4%) of patients in the study group required admission to the HDU or PICU. only one confirmed pertussis case within the study group was in the PICU compared to three from the pertussis negative cohort. the most frequently detected virus in the pertussis positive group was rhinovirus (42.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the pertussis negative group (31.9%) both leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in the pertussis positive than the pertussis negative group. the ROC curve analysis was constructed to obtain the sensitivity and specificity of leucocyte and lymphocyte counts at varying cutoff levels. 71 tested PLI cases, 12 (16.9%) were confirmed as pertussis. this figure is higher compared to a similar study done in Iran that included 174 cases of PLI in children over four years (20082012) only 13.2% were confirmed to have pertussis. the whole-cell pertussis vaccine is used for infants at two, four, and six months of age. there was no confirmed infection in those who had completed the vaccine. the surge in PLI in our setting is different from the recent epidemic in the western world. the national PICU from 1991 to 2003 showed that out of a total of 72 children, 35 (49.0%) received assisted ventilation, four died, and 19.0% were readmitted. more recent data from a multicenter study on 127 patients with confirmed pertussis in 25 PICUs across the US showed that 55 (43.0%) required mechanical ventilation. pertussis remains a clinical diagnosis in our institutions. leukocytosis and lymphocytosis are reliable predictors."}
