{"summary": "dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) is a cell surface protease with a wide range of biological functions. in the lung, the capillaries may be the main source of DPP4 activity. submucosal serous glands and alveolar cells also express DPP4 (1). the mechanisms of LIRI are complex as described by den Hengst et al. (10) the pathophysiology is as follows: due to organ ischemia macrophages, endothelial cells, and other immune cells generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), cause uncoupling of calcium/calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthases (NOS), activate nuclear factor-B (NF-B), activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hai et al. (11) used an irreversible DDP4 inhibitor, AB192, in an ex-vivo perfusion model of lung transplantation in rats. a follow-up study resulted in better lung function, lower PAWP, lower wet-dry ratio (an indication of pulmonary edema), lower myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (reduced neutrophil activity), less histologic edema and congestion and a significantly va inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6, and inhibits NO production. VIP is also a strong vascular and bronchial dilator (16) anaerobic glycolysis takes over the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production from the normal oxidative phosphorylation. degradation of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine occurs during hypoxia (10,18) GLP-1 inhibits the production of free radicals by influencing NADPH oxidase through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. inhibition of DPP4 significantly reduces vascular oxidative stress via multiple mechanisms. phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway play pivotal roles in cell signal transduction, inflammation, stress, apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell growth. Akt and MAPK activate redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NrF2), which is essential for protection against oxidative stress in different forms of ALI. DPP4i prevents injury by attenuating NF-B via an Akt dependent pathway. also thrombin-induced activation of NF-B and subsequent expression of IL-8 was reported to be regulated through the PI3K/Akt pathway in the lungs. in ischemic myocytes, SDF-1/CXCR4/MAPK and SDF-1/CXCR4/Akt interactions were important for protection against IRI. the same results were seen in cardiomyocytes where DPP4i reduces the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restored SDF-1 to normal levels (39). these mechanisms might also play a role in the ischemic lung. anaerobic glycolysis takes over the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. degradation of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine occurs during hypoxia. when NO reacts with ROS, it forms secondary reactive nitrogen species, such as nitrosonium cation (NO+), nitroxil anion (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO) by reaction of NO with ROS, the physiological and protective action of NO will be lost. GLP-1 inhibits the production of free radicals by influencing cAMP kinase A (PKA) pathway. Akt plays pivotal roles in cell signal transduction, inflammation, stress, apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell growth. Akt and MAPK activate redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NrF2) which is essential for protection against oxidative stress in different forms of ALI. DPP4i prevents injury by attenuating NF-B via an Akt dependent pathway. also thrombin-induced activation of NF-B and subsequent expression of IL-8 was reported to be regulated through the PI3K/Akt pathway in the lungs. DF-1 through CXCR4 receptors were linked to MAPK and PI3K/Akt. the same results were seen in cardiomyocytes where DPP4i reduced the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restored SDF-1 to normal levels. this mechanism might also play a role in the ischemic lung. VIP has an important protective role against xanthine oxidase(15) and might be responsible for the reduction of xanthine oxidase levels in LIRI. several studies indeed showed higher VIP-activity (12-14), which gives an incentive to further investigate the potential of VIP-induced xanthine oxidase inhibition during ischemia-reperfusion injury. DPP4i has been shown to increase the production of SOD, GSH-Px, and Trx in an atherosclerosis model (25) this mechanism could be an important target for further investigation in LIRI models. the role of NrF2 activation in LIRI remains uncertain. PP4 substrates VIP, GLP-1 and SDF-1 in lung ischemia reperfusion injury. protection could be attributed to anti-inflammatory actions of VIP, glucagon-like peptide-1, and SDF-1."}
