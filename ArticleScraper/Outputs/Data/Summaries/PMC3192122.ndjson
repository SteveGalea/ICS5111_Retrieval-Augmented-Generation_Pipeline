{"summary": "more than 127,000 confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 800 deaths, were reported in mainland China. the distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in mainland China are largely unknown. the findings may have significant implications in the future pandemic preparedness and response. more than 214 countries and territories or communities had reported laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1 including over 17798 deaths. the first case in mainland china was reported on may 11th, 2009. by march 31st 2010, more than 127,000 laboratorial confirmed cases were reported in the country. the study was conducted to investigate the geographic distribution of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as the risk factors for adverse patient outcome after initial H1N1 virus infection in mainland China. the study was therefore conducted to investigate the geographic distribution of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic. median time from illness onset to hosptial discharge was 7 days. gender, time from illness onset to hospital admission, general symptoms and respiratory symptoms were all related to the outcome of the H1N1 patients. females patients had a lower porpotion of recovery (HR 0.9, 95%CI: 0.7\u20131.0), but the differnence was not statistically significant. the weekly reported new cases of confirmed H1N1 infection in different geographic regions of mainland China between May 7th to August 12th, 2009 are presented in Figure 2. Geographic Distribution The weekly reported new cases of confirmed H1N1 infection in different geographic regions of mainland China during May 7th to August 12th, 2009 are presented in Figure 2. 87.3% of the cases were imported ones, while the domestic cases (67.3%) became dominant between June and August. male sex 486/885 54.9 Age range from 15 to 40 745/885 84.2 Chronic pulmonary disease 25/882 2.8 Delay to hospital admission (2 days) 590/769 66.7 General symptoms 852/885 96.3 Respiratory symptoms 833/885 94.1 Pharyngeal abnormality 822/885 92.9 Tonsil abnormality 333/885 37.6 Abnormal white blood cells count 164/849 18.5 Complication 108/839 12.2 Antiviral medication 6 0.078 3.468 0.063 0.864 (0.741\u20131.008) time to hospital admission 0.591 0.094 39.166 0.001 0.554 (0.460\u20130.667) Respiratory symptoms 1.263 0.172 53.819 0.001 0.283 (0.202\u20130.396) 87.3% of the cases were imported, while the domestic cases (67.3%) became dominant between June and August. the cases were more likely to occur in the southeast coastal areas or areas that serve as major transport stations with relatively prosperous economy. use of GIS in our analyses in this study showed that the incidence of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic in mainland China was higher in the coastal provinces in the southeast as well as in Beijing and Shanghai. in most cities and districts, there was still no confirmed cases, the overall spread level of H1N1 virus was still regional. adult H1N1 patients, age, chronic pulmonary disease and the appearance of general symptoms, delayed hospital admission and the appearance of respiratory symptoms but not gender were independent risk factors for adverse outcome. a confirmed case was defined as a person with influenza-like clinical manifestations and positive laboratory test for H1N1 virus. clinical outcome recovery was defined as resolution of symptoms as well as negative test results for H1N1 virus RNA for two consecutive days in throat swabs. potential risk factors assessed included gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease, time from onset to hospital admission, general symptoms, pharyngeal abnormality, tonsil abnormality, white blood cells count, complication and antiviral medication. the cases included in this study were those reported in the early phase of the epidemic between may 7th and august 16th, 2009. the case report form included: gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease history, time from onset to hospital admission, general symptoms (at least one of the following: dizziness, headache, chill, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, anorexia, and/or conjunctivitis) the cumulative resolution rate was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. the subgroups were based on gender, time from onset to hospital admission, general symptoms or respiratory symptoms."}
