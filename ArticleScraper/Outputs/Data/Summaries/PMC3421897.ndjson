{"summary": "in today's interconnected world, infectious diseases are able to spread rapidly and globally and appear to be emerging more frequently (50) new infectious diseases have been identified at the rate of more than one per year from the 1970s to the 1990s (120), and more have recently emerged, with some lethal ones, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. broad-spectrum antibiotics have, until recently, been the mainstay of antibiotic therapy. increasing threat of drug-resistant bacteria has forced a rethink on best strategies for treating them. emergence of new recombinant technologies, such as phage display, has provided significant opportunities for development of more specific antimicrobials. phage display technology is based on the construction of a polypeptide library fused to a bacteriophage coat protein. the most commonly used phages are M13 and fd filamentous phage because they do not lyse infected bacteria during their life cycle. the ssDNA of the phage enters into the cytoplasm, converts into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and starts replication and expression using host enzymes. pVIII is replaced by pVIII in the channel formed by pI, pXI, pIV, and host thioredoxin. libraries constructed by introducing foreign DNA inserts into the phage genome will result in the fusion gene product displayed on the coat proteins. fusion library DNA on phage vectors with natural phage promoters will produce a polyvalent display on the phage surface. monovalent display systems are more suitable for the identification of the strongest binders. polyvalent display prevents the highest-affinity clones from being identified because it confers a high apparent affinity on weak-binding clones. random peptide libraries are the most common type of phage display libraries. methods for the production of peptide libraries are still based on the procedure developed by Zoller and Smith (170, 171) fUSE5-ZZ phage was introduced into the system, making it possible to display full-length IgGs on phage particles. soluble IgGs expressed in pMAZ360-IgG-transformed E. coli cells were captured on the phage particles, leading to a full-length IgG phage display library. the most commonly used commercial libraries are new England BioLabs (NEB) Ph.D. phage display libraries, which have a diversity of 109 independent peptides. biopanning is a highly flexible and dynamic step in a phage display experiment. a phage display library can select phage binding to an immobilized target. the results can vary due to multiple factors, such as library complexity. the valency of a displayed molecule on a virion is a critical parameter in the selection of candidates. whole-cell phage display panning is the best choice for whole-cell screening. peptides or antibodies are first identified by screening whole cells against a phage display library. a large variety of receptors are being screened at one time. the specificity of phage selected in nonbiased screens is 10- to 100-fold higher for the targeted cell type than for other cell types (11) cell-specific peptides are often more useful for targeting certain cell types and for delivery of drugs. in vivo panning, it is also possible to target specific cell types or even organs. filamentous phage binds to the F pilus of a host E. coli cell through pIII. the host tolA protein starts to depolymerize the phage coat proteins. pV is replaced by pVIII in the channel formed by pI, pXI, pIV, and host thioredoxin. fusion library DNA on phage vectors with natural phage promoters will produce a polyvalent display on the phage surface. monovalent display systems are more suitable for the identification of the strongest binders because they allow for selection based on pure affinity. polyvalent display prevents the highest-affinity clones from being identified. not all peptides or proteins can be selected using phage display. some sequences may be toxic to the expression vector, interfere with phage assembly, or be sensitive to bacterial proteases. peptide libraries are the most common type of phage display libraries. libraries with functional full-length antibodies displayed on phage particles may become much more ideal as screening tools. fUSE5-ZZ phage particles display the fragment crystallizable region (Fc)-binding ZZ protein on phage particles. soluble IgGs expressed in pMAZ360-IgG-transformed E. coli cells were captured on the phage particles. the system flexibly applies fUSE5-ZZ phage as both a helper and a capture phage. it significantly contributes to the development of full-length antibody phage display libraries. phages whose displayed peptides/antibodies bind the selector are captured. the captured phage can then be eluted with mild acid, alkaline, or detergent solutions without affecting phage infectivity. the results can vary due to multiple factors, such as library complexity, nature of the target, binding affinity and avidity. direct coating is easy to perform but may result in an inaccessible ligand binding site. in the case of insoluble materials, biopanning can be performed in a suspension. panning against whole cells is another option (149) cell-specific peptides are often more useful for targeting certain cell types and for delivery of drugs. cell-based screening has the advantage in that it is an assumption-free strategy with the potential to recognize cell surface structures that may not have been considered targets. antigens on the cell surface of pathogens are appealing targets for biologics because they provide potential binding sites for molecules to interfere with bacterial division (71), colonization, and virulence (111). both strategies have been widely applied for developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments for infectious diseases. 12-mer peptide library Antibiotic design 136, 158 LPS/lipid A scFv libraries, peptide libraries Anti-Gram-negative bacterial agents 43, 44,

vancomycin have been reported since the 1980s. Listeria monocytogenes is a severe food-borne pathogen that causes life-threatening listeriosis. it is important to detect low levels of the pathogen in food samples. a surface plasmon resonance sensor was developed based on the scFv antibody. synthesis of the bacterial cell wall involves a series of enzymes, such as MurA-G, transglycosylases, and transpeptidases (122, 141) interrupting any stage in the procedure can lead to failure in peptidoglycan synthesis and subsequent bacteria lysis. novel antimicrobial agents targeting cell wall biosynthesis are of increasing interest. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes stomach infections. urease, one of the important virulence factors produced by H. pylori, has been used as a target for phage display. inini, peptides with antimicrobial properties for haemophilus influenzae (6) and Campylobacter jejuni (5), and an antibody against Chlamydia trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) (70) have been identified. bacterial magnetic particles used as a bacterial membrane model for phage biopanning (136) several antibodies and peptides against LPS from different bacteria strains have been identified. purified lipid A can also be used as a target for phage display screening. human CD81 (hCD81) is considered a receptor for HCV. its antagonist peptide, SPQYWTGPA, was found by panning on whole hCD81-expressing NIH/3T3 cells. h5N1 influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies can neutralize the H5N1 virus (69) cyclic phage display library panned against purified UV-treated Sin Nombre virus (SNV), obtained peptides with highly specific binding affinity and inhibition of virus infectivity. in 2001, a 12-mer peptide (PCQRAIFQSICN) that inhibited Plasmodium invasion of midgut and salivary glands was identified (41). the same peptide was affinity selected in both hemocoel infection and oral ingestion selection strategies. phage display has rapidly contributed to epitope mapping, diagnosis, therapeutics, and vaccine development in malaria research. listeria monocytogenes is a severe food-borne pathogen that causes life-threatening listeriosis. it is important to detect low levels of the pathogen in food samples. a surface plasmon resonance sensor was developed based on the scFv antibody. peptides bound to L. monocytogenes were identified by panning a 9-mer peptide and 12-mer peptide phage display library. the main component of the bacterial cell wall is peptidoglycan, a heteropolymer composed of cross-linked N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. peptides NHNMHRTTQWPL and TMGFTAPRFPHY inhibited MurE and MurF activity. inhibitors against P. aeruginosa FtsA and FtsZ, bacterial cell division-related proteins, were screened out from the Ph.D.-12 and Ph.D.-C7C libraries. screening was also used to identify peptides bound to E. coli. phage probes for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (131) and Mycoplasma arginini (33) have been identified. antibody against Chlamydia trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) (70) has been identified. LPS is an endotoxin that binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex and induces strong responses from the mammalian immune system. phage display could provide an approach for selection of antibodies and peptides specific for LPS. NS3 or E2 protein were isolated from phage display libraries by an italian research group (14, 105) some of the Fabs against the E2 protein showed nanomolar-range affinity. these Fabs were then converted into full-length IgGs in a CHO cell expression system, which successfully increased affinity to E2 protein by about 100-fold (12). a cyclic phage display library was panned against purified UV-treated Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and obtained peptides with highly specific binding affinity and inhibition of virus infectivity. peptides conjugated onto multivalent nanoparticles resulted in more-potent antiviral activity (45). in 2001, a 12-mer peptide (PCQRAIFQSICN) inhibited Plasmodium invasion of midgut and salivary glands was identified. after 30 min, the salivary glands were dissected to elute and collect bound phages. phage display has rapidly contributed to epitope mapping, diagnosis, therapeutics, and vaccine development in malaria research. MedImmune (AstraZeneca) Numax-YTE (MEDI-557) Respiratory syncytial virus Humanized IgG1; optimized version of motavizumab Antigenic A site of the F protein Phase I 19, 30, 31, 64, 155, 156, 157 Affitech A/S AT005 Cancer and infectious disease Expanded-spectrum human version of bavituximab PS lipid Preclinical 110, 130 Human Genome Sciences R motavizumab bound to the RSV F protein 70-fold more than palivizumab. motavizumab reduced nasal and pulmonary RSV titers by up to 25-fold. motavizumab reduced cultivatable RSV in nasal aspirates of previously healthy children with no adverse side effects. medImmune engineered the human Fc region to enhance the affinity to human FcRn through phage display (31). Variants with up to 57-fold increases in affinity were identified in the study. one of the variants has been further applied for the modification of motavizumab. human antibody AT005 is an improved, fully human version of bavituximab. the status of this antibody is not disclosed on the Affitech website. toxin containing a PA protein, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) enhances the binding of LF and EF to the anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) on the mammalian cell surface and promotes LF and EF entering the cells. these toxins inhibit normal immune function, interfere with signal transduction pathways, and ultimately cause cell death. Phylogica is a peptide drug discovery company based in Perth, Australia. from 2009 to 2012, HGS is delivering another 45,000 doses. Phylogica claims Phylomer libraries are the largest and most structurally diverse libraries of natural peptides. the word \u201cCIS\u201d is derived from cis activity of the RepA protein. it refers to the exclusive binding to its template DNA. the system allows peptides and proteins to be displayed in vitro. more than 130 proteins or peptides have been approved as therapeutic drugs by the FDA. more than 20 MAbs and 50 peptides are therapeutics for different human diseases. the number keeps increasing and will hopefully double within the following several years. motavizumab was shown to be noninferior to palivizumab, resulting in a 26% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization. previous studies have shown that the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is important for the long serum half-life of IgG (40, 56) human antibody AT005 is currently in preclinical research. the target of AT005 is phosphatidylserine (PS), which is one of the most abundant anionic phospholipid molecules located inside the plasma membrane of healthy cells. anthrax is caused by the infection of the spore-forming bacterium B. anthracis. anthrax toxin is a tripartite toxin containing a PA protein, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) the PA protein promotes LF and EF entering the cells. raxibacumab was safe, well tolerated, and bioavailable after a single intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) dose (86). raxibacumab was safe, well tolerated, and bioavailable after a single intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) dose (86). phylogica and Dynamic Microbials are a peptide drug discovery company based in Perth, Australia. Dynamic Microbials successfully isolated peptides that inhibited the growth of A. baumannii in vitro using T7 phage display. the peptides were then patented by the world Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 2010 Phylogica initiated the collaboration with MedImmune. the administration of MAb drugs is generally IV, IM, or subcutaneous (SC) antibodies can hardly diffuse through the gastrointestinal epithelium and are easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. anti-infective MAbs introduced in this section are mostly in the discovery or preclinical stage. alternative display technologies, such as aptamers, ribosome display, and mRNA display, are engaged in discovery of novel anti-infectives. aptamer, a single-stranded oligonucleotide that specifically binds to molecular targets such as proteins, benefits from its smaller size, is easier to modify, and has larger-scale synthesis than antibody therapeutics. transgenic mice that express antibodies with human CDRs have been developed. a novel technology identifying MAbs from immortalized human B cells was established. recombinant techniques can drive selection/affinity maturation cycles using phage display to derive potent \u201clead\u201d molecules within weeks to months. aaron miller: affinities/potencies are not routinely retrieved from commercially available naive libraries. miller: there is now a nascent pipeline of biological drug candidates in development. miller: it is important to consider the attrition rate of biological versus small molecules. phase II to FDA approval, success rates are 52% and 37% respectively (91). phage display-derived MAbs are benchmarking at a 35% success rate compared to an industry-wide average of 12% for a small-molecule drug candidate."}
