{"summary": "virus are classified into three types, A, B, and C, based on variations in the nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) (1). inactivated vaccines and antiviral agents are available to prevent or treat influenza A and B. virus cause seasonal epidemics with 300,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide every year. two classes of antivirals that target influenza virus proteins have been approved by the fda. the NA inhibitors, oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) and zanamivir, are used globally to treat influenza infection. ionophores are small molecules that facilitate movement of specific ions across lipid bilayer membranes. they are divided into electrogenic and electroneutral ionophores (16) polyether ionophores, such as monensin, are promising bioactive molecules due to their broad-spectrum anticancer and antibacterial properties. antiviral activity was mediated via inhibition of endosomal acidification and M2 proton channel activity simultaneously. oral administration of salinomycin together with OSV-P to mice showed improved antiviral efficacy compared to their separate treatments. salinomycin, which has five ether rings and a terminal carboxylic acid, exhibited the most potent activity against the influenza strains PR8, HK, and Lee. salinomycin suppressed NP, HA, M1 and M2 expression of PR8 in a dose-dependent manner. citopathic-effect-based antiviral assay of selected hit compounds Compound CC50 (M)a in MDCK cells EC50 (M)b against influenza virus (SIc) a Concentration required to improve viability of influenza virus-infected MDCK cells by 50%. 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 M salinomycin was treated with 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 M salinomycin. the amount of infectious viral particles in the culture supernatant was quantified in a plaque assay. rgA/Korea/09/200953- 60(H275Y)b A/Korea/2785/2009c rgA/Puerto Rico/8/ 1934(H275Y)d A/Taiwan/1/1986 Salinomycin 1.4 0.3 1.9 0.2 1.2 0.0 1.1 0.2 0.2 1.7 0.0 0.7 0.1 3.5 0.1 (41.6) (30.3) (48.8) (53.4) (34.0) (86.3) (16. resistant strain generated by reverse genetics to have the H275Y mutation in NA of PR8. d strain generated by reverse genetics to have the H275Y mutation in NA of PR8. incubating virus with salinomycin at 4\u00b0C for 1 h (viral adsorption) had no effect on viral growth. epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) suppressed virus infection markedly by 92.3%. treatment at 2 to 5 or 4 to 5 h p.i. suppressed PR8 replication by only 60.8% and 53.4%, respectively. the results of the time-of-addition study indicated that salinomycin could target the early stage of the influenza virus life cycle. salinomycin is a monovalent cation ionophore isolated from Streptomyces albus. it is presumed to prevent formation of proton gradients by vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) existing in intracellular organelles and at the plasma membrane. a control image of EGCG-treated cells revealed no NP signals. intracellular vesicles were stained with acridine orange to monitor pH change. no or weak red fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to salinomycin. this result indicated that the antiviral ionophore raised the pH of acidic cytoplasmic compartments. cells were incubated for 8 h at 35\u00b0C to allow sufficient nuclear import of incoming vRNPs. they were then costained for viral NP and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) or lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). salinomycin induced aberrant distribution of NP with accumulation in the cytoplasm. EEA1 and LAMP1 were detected using their specific antibodies. followed by an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (red) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). original magnification, 630. ic conditions and real-time activity of pH-gated proton channels were monitored using a fluorescent dye sensitive to membrane potential. at the low pH, null VLPs exhibited a basal increase in fluorescence. this is likely caused by cellular proton pumps incorporated within the VLP membrane or by nonselective proton diffusion. we calculated that it suppressed PR8M2-S and PR8M2-R function by 54% and 72%, respectively, at the endpoint (5 min) of the experiment. salinomycin expressed antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses in cells by hindering endocytic pathways. activity was measured at the same time interval and under the same conditions as for panel B. another putative target, HA2, was investigated for whether its membrane fusion activity is regulated by salinomycin. at 16 h p.i., cells were preincubated with TPCK-trypsin (5 g/ml) together with DMSO, 2 M salinomycin, or 0.5 g/ml anti-HA2 antibody. after staining with Giemsa, fixed cells were visualized by microscopy. the numbers on the axes represent normalized FIC50s. the sums of both FIC50 values (FIC50s) of fixed-ratio interaction and their mean values were quantified (B and D) antiviral effect in vivo is reproducible in another mouse model. mice were infected with an OSV-P-resistant influenza virus, rgK/09(H275Y), where the H275Y mutation was reverse genetically introduced into the stalk-truncated NA of the mouse-adapted rgA/Korea/09/200953-60 strain. salinomycin (10 mg/kg) alone did not show antiviral activity in this model. mice were inoculated intranasally with 5 MLD50 of mouse-adapted influenza virus PR8 (red arrow) antivirals were administered orally, once 4 h prior to infection and once 4 h after. groups of five mice were treated with OSV-P (0.1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) or salinomycin (10 mg/kg) alone or with a combination of the two (0.1 mg/kg) salinomycin exhibited the most potent activity against influenza strains PR8, HK, and Lee. salinomycin exhibited the most potent activity against the influenza strains PR8, HK, and Lee. salinomycin suppressed NP, HA, M1, and M2 expression of PR8 in a dose-dependent manner. a plaque assay verified salinomycin-mediated reduction in the number of infectious influenza viral particles from the culture supernatant on days 1 and 2 postinfection. 0.7 0.1 (48.3) 0.4 0.1 (84.5) 0.8 0.1 (42.3) RBVh >100.0 18.8 1.8 (>5.3) 12.8 3.2 (>7.8) 13.5 0.5 (>7.4) OSV-Ci >100.0 0.02 0.01 (>5,000) 0.005 (>20,000) 0.13 0.03 (>769) a Concentration required to improve viability of influenza virus-infected MDCK cells by 50%. cell viability ranged from 0% (cells infected with each virus) to 100% (mock-infected cells). data are expressed as means SD of three replicates. n.d., not detected. b Mouse-adapted, OSV-resistant strain generated by reverse genetics to have a truncation between amino acids 53 and 60 and a point mutation, H275Y, in NA of PR8. b OSV-resistant strain generated by reverse genetics to have the H275Y mutation in NA of rgA/Korea/09/200953-60. uck/Korea/GJ79/ 2007 (H3N8) Salinomycin 2.5 0.1 (22.4) 2.6 0.1 (21.6) 1.3 0.4 (43.2) 0.3 (34.0) 1.6 0.5 (36.2) 4.2 0.1 (13.5) AMT >100.0 (ND) 0.1 0.0 (> 1,000) >100.0 (ND) 0.5 0.1 (>200.0) 0.6 0.3 (>181.8) RBV 6.8 0.8 (>14.7) 53.5 incubating virus with salinomycin at 4\u00b0C for 1 h (viral adsorption) had no effect on viral growth. incubating virus with salinomycin at 4\u00b0C for 1 h (viral adsorption) had no effect on viral growth. epigallocatechin gallate suppressed virus infection markedly by 92.3%. MDCK cells were infected with influenza PR8 virus for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. after removal of unadsorbed virus, the cells were inoculated for an additional 4 h at 35\u00b0C. salinomycin is a monovalent cation ionophore isolated from Streptomyces albus. it is presumed to prevent formation of proton gradients by vacuolar ATPase. it neutralizes acidic intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, or the Golgi apparatus in cells. salinomycin inhibits endosomal acidification. MDCK cells were stimulated with DMSO (mock), salinomycin, bafilomycin A1 (a V-ATPase inhibitor), or chloroquine (an intralysosomal pH neutralizing agent) each sample was then treated with acridine orange (4 g/ml) for 10 min. salinomycin induced aberrant distribution of NP with accumulation in the cytoplasm. NP complexed with early or late endosomes gathered around the perinuclear region. we concluded that salinomycin-mediated defects in endosomal acidification may be linked with the failure of vRNPs to escape from early or late endosomal vesicles. retroviral Gag-based virus-like particles (VLPs) were prepared by ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants from transfected 293T cells. mutant PR8 M2 (PR8M2-S), which harbors amino acid substitutions V27 and S31, and wild-type PR8 M2 (PR8M2-R) were independently incorporated into null VLPs to compare their susceptibilities to salinomycin. d with FCCP VLPs led to a sudden increase in proton transport at 36 s. this indicated that FCCP could transport protons bidirectionally. salinomycin compensated the effect of FCCP, suggesting that the activity of an electroneutral ionophore is more dominant. salinomycin nullifies the proton channel activity of influenza A virus M2. VLPs were purified by ultracentrifugation and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. channel activity of PR8M2-S- or PR8M2-R-combined VLPs was measured. PR8-infected Vero E6 cells were infected with the antiviral hit by using an HA2-specific antibody as a control to compare changes in HA-mediated cell-cell fusion efficiency in acidic buffer. the total number of nuclei in syncytia per field was reduced by 61.4% and 79.3% by 0.5 g/ml and 5.0 g/ml of the anti-HA2 antibody with statistical significance. syncytia was counted from 16 representative images per sample at pH 5.6. compared differences between the DMSO-treated group and the compound- or antibody-treated groups. EC50 values of salinomycin and OSV-C against wild-type PR8 were 1.81 and 0.07 M. mice were inoculated intranasally with five 50% mouse lethal doses (MLD50) of mouse-adapted PR8 (maPR8). oral administration with salinomycin at doses of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg of body weight per day for 6 days had no therapeutic effect. a lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) did not show satisfactory therapeutic activity, showing 0% survival. rgK/09(H275Y)-infected mice were inoculated intranasally with 5 MLD50 of mouse-adapted influenza virus PR8 (red arrow) there was no statistical significance in body weight changes between the group and the group treated with OSV-P in combination with salinomycin. however, this combination improved mean survival rates from 60% to 100%. group of five mice were treated with OSV-P (0.1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) or salinomycin (10 mg/kg) alone or with a combination of the two (0.1 mg/kg OSV-P and 10 mg/kg salinomycin). Statistical analysis was done using two-tailed Student\u2019s t test relative to the OSV-P (0.1 mg/kg) group. monensin is the most actively studied compound regarding its role as a monovalent cation/proton antiporter during influenza virus infection. but the results were contradictory with respect to viral replication and infectivity. a fusion assay showed that monensin was reverse to that of the M2 blocker, AMT (24). a report showed the potential benefits of combination therapy of favipiravir (T-705; a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor) and OSV-P; either compound was ineffective at suboptimal doses, while their combination led to a significant increase in body weight and survival of mice infected with influenza A virus (33). the improved antiviral effect might be attributed to inhibition of multiple steps essential for virus replication, such as endosomal acidification, M2 proton salinomycin derivatives and a lower-dose NA inhibitor may also be useful when stockpiles of OSV-P are insufficient to respond to an influenza pandemic. it could also protect transmission of avian influenza virus from poultry to humans or among poultry by treating chickens or ducks with salinomycin. ionophores facilitate countertransport of protons and Na+ ions, which exist abundantly (at a concentration of about 150 mM) under physiological conditions, bidirectionally across lipid bilayers to reach an ionic equilibrium. in the future, we are going to explore antiviral effects of salinomycin against other enveloped viruses that enter cells via endosome-mediated endocytosis. another recombinant virus, rgK/09(H275Y), was created by genetically replacing His at position 275 with Tyr in NA of the rgA/Korea/09/200953-60 strain. another mouse-adapted influenza virus, maPR8, was a kind gift from H. J. Kim (26). plasmid pcDNA-PR8M2-R was cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA 3.1/myc-His() A. the resulting construct was named pcDNA-PR8M2-R. the plasmid expresses amantadine-sensitive PR8M2 harboring amino acids V27 and S31. chemical library, high-purity compound was used in all experiments. other hit compounds, Evans blue and atovaquone, were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. mice anti-NP (catalog no. 11675-MM03; Sino Biological, Beijing, China), rabbit anti-HA2 (catalog no. 86001-RM01; Sino Biological), mouse anti-M1 (catalog no. sc-57881; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-M2 (catalog no. sc-32238; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.
