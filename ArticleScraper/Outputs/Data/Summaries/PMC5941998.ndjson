{"summary": "sickle cell disease is characterized by a shortened life expectancy, hemolytic anemia, acute episodes of vaso-occlusive pain, and recurrent chronic damage to vital organs. Respiratory infections or asthma attacks that would have no lasting effects can trigger severe or even fatal manifestations in those with sickle cell disease. metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D],17,18 binds to the vitamin D receptor to function as a transcription factor. it regulates the adaptive immune system by modulating T-lymphocyte proliferation and function and by downregulating the inflammatory response and cytokine expression. participants were 99 children with sickle cell disease, ages 2-19 years, recruited from among 200 patients followed at the Columbia University Medical Center Pediatric Sickle Cell Program. subjects were to have been on a stable dose of hydroxyurea or chronic asthma medication for 3 months, not on chronic transfusion therapy, not on chronic steroids, and without history of hypercalcemia. participants with 25-OHD concentrations of 5-60 ng/mL were randomly assigned using randomly permuted blocks of size 2, 4, or 6 assignments. participants were seen monthly for observed administration of study medication and interval history, including respiratory events, dietary vitamin D and calcium intake. a clinical trial data and safety monitoring board was organized to monitor the trial. the primary outcome was the annual rate of respiratory events. the questionnaire queried whether the subject has had any of the following 6 symptoms in the past 2 weeks. a new event was counted if 7 days had elapsed since the last counted event. patients with prolonged respiratory symptom(s) lasting >2 weeks were evaluated by the study pulmonologist. the final diagnosis determined whether the symptom represented a respiratory event. primary study analysis was an examination of the annual rate of respiratory events (infections, asthma exacerbations, or ACS) in comparison with the rate of respiratory events over a baseline period of 1 year, using an intention-to-treat analysis. the original sample size of 40 participants per group was estimated to provide power 0.9 with a 2-sided of 0.05. participants were 99 children with sickle cell disease, ages 2-19 years, recruited from among 200 patients followed at the Columbia University Medical Center Pediatric Sickle Cell Program. participants were recruited from among these 99 eligible patients, ages 3-20 years old, with baseline respiratory events data collected over an approximate period of 1 year prior to the trial that served as baseline for the primary outcome measure. patients with 25-OHD concentrations of 5-60 ng/mL were excluded. none of the participants had levels >60 ng/mL. randomization was performed by the research pharmacy. questionnaire was administered in person during monthly outpatient study visits. sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 77% in identifying presence of 9 viral respiratory pathogens. adenovirus (B, C, and E), enterovirus, influenza virus (A and B), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b), rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (A and B) a \u201crespiratory infection\u201d was defined as (1) runny nose, cough, or sore throat for 2 days or any of these symptoms for 1 day accompanied by fever. an \u201casthma exacerbation\u201d was defined as a physician-diagnosed acute asthma that required treatment with corticosteroids, emergency room treatment, or hospital admission. trial sample size of 31 subjects per group was calculated to still provide >80% power with a 2-sided of 0.05. the actual trial sample size of 31 subjects per group was calculated to still provide >80% power with a 2-sided of 0.05. participants were randomly assigned to monthly high-dose (n = 31) or standard-dose (n = 31) vitamin D3. 96.5% of the expected person-months on study was completed compared with 93.4% in the standard-dose group. 1 (3) 1 (3) S+ thalassemia 1 (3) 0 (0) Hydroxyurea, n (%) 18 (58) 17 (55) 1.00 History of ACS, n (%) 9 (29) 10 (32) 1.00 History of asthma, n (%) 14 (45) 13 (42) 1.00 Oxygen saturation, mean SD, % 98.9 1.5 98.7 1.4 0.57 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, mean SD, ng/mL 15.0 predicted 68.0 14.5 72.3 16.8 0.40 FENO, ppb 19.3 14.3 16.9 11.6 0.50 MIP, cm H2O 69.1 27.0 59.9 23.0 0.25 MEP, cm H2O 66.3 18.6 66.3 23.7 1.00 Hand-grip strength, mean SD, pounds force n = 25 n = 27 Right hand 21.1 16.2 16.9 11.5 0.28 Left hand 19.9 16.8 16.0 11.1 0.34 Dominant emergency department and hospitalization did not show significant differences between the groups over the 2-year treatment period. the average mean 25-OHD concentration during the 2-year treatment period was significantly higher in the high-dose group (mean 36.1 ng/mL) versus the standard-dose group. the high-dose group stabilized at a mean concentration of 37.0 ng/mL. the mean serum 25-OHD concentrations of the groups receiving standard-dose (12 000 IU/mo) and high-dose (100 000 IU/mo) vitamin D3 did not differ statistically at baseline and rose to plateau at different levels at 3-4 months.
