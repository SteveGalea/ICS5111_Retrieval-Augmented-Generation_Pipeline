{"summary": "a mutation in the HA protein that lowers the activation pH eliminates H5N1 replication in ducks and enhances replication and virulence in mice. resistance to acid inactivation is a new marker for H5N1 adaption from birds to mammals. a virus lacking UL97, but complemented by expression of human papillomavirus 16 E7 to inactivate pRb, remains defective for nuclear egress. the accompanying disruption of the nuclear lamina and phosphorylation of lamin A/C is a crucial substrate of UL97 in nuclear egress. HCoV-EMC is more sensitive than SARS-CoV to the antiviral action of beta interferon (IFN-) this finding suggests that HCoV-EMC has not reached the pathogenic potential of SARS-CoV and that IFN- may be a promising therapeutic option."}
