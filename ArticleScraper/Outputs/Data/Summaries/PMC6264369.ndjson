{"summary": "the two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, \u201cAsian Influenza (1957/H2N2)\u201d and \u201cHong Kong Influenza (1968/H3N2)\u201d resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2\u20133 million people globally. the most effective antiviral drug is the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, which target the NA glycoproteins of influenza A and B virus. the essential oil is very appreciated for its characteristic pleasant and long lasting woody, earthy, and camphoraceous odor. it is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as it presents various types of pharmacological activity according to the composition of the oil [16,17]. CC50 a (M) Influenza A (A/Udorn/307/72) IC50b (M) SI c Patchouli alcohol >20.0 4.03 0.23 * >4.96 Oseltamivir >20.0 0.031 0.012 >645.16 Values represent the mean values (SD) of three independent experiments (P 0.01). patchouli alcohol showed anti-influenza A (H2N2) activity in a time-dependent manner. it showed best antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 8 M during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 97.68% 2.09% for influenza A (H2N2) at 72 h. the mean value of body weight of mice in each group was statistically analyzed. the mean weights of mice administered at the 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol and 10 mg/kg/dose of patchouli alcohol were not significantly different compared with the normal control mice. oseltamivir at this dose level (1 mg/kg/day) showed 50% protection (measured by survivors/total) against the influenza virus. patchouli alcohol is determined to be bound within NA protein. the interaction energy (Einter) of patchouli alcohol with NA was calculated at 40.38 kcal mol1. the vdW rather than electrostatic interactions were found to play a dominant role, contribute to about 72% (29.18 kcal mol1) the patchouli alcohol was bound at the active site which also bound to oseltamivir and zanamivir. patchouli alcohol matches with the NA active site and has an acceptable interaction energy. the connolly surfaces of the NA active site are created using the InsightII 2005 scripts. patchouli alcohol is represented by ball and stick model. CC50 of patchouli alcohol was above 20 mM, which indicated that patchouli alcohol did not affect the growth of MDCK. the antiviral effects of patchouli alcohol were not due to the cytotoxicity. patchouli alcohol showed anti-influenza A (H2N2) activity in a time-dependent manner. it showed best antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 8 M during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 97.68% 2.09% for influenza A. no significant effect was detected when patchouli alcohol was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when patchouli alcohol was added during the adsorption phase. biochemical studies have indicated that the bioactivity of NA protein is essential determinant after the replication of influenza A (H2N2) virus. a comparison of efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir in vivo mouse influenza model showed that at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the influenza virus. when the dose was lowered to 1 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed weaker protection (measured by survivors/total) the energy-minimized patchouli alcohol-NA complex has been in equilibrium since about 0.5 ns, and then retains quite stable in the last 19.5 ns. it is consistent with the previous MD results of other NA inhibitors [23,24,25,26,27,28] Arg118, Arg152, Arg152, Trp178, Ala246, Glu276, Arg292, Asn294 and Gln347, especially residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 of the NA protein. it suggests that the NA functions will be affected by the presence of patchouli alcohol, consistent with the above experiments. ouli alcohol and oseltamivir were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA, purity > 99%) the cells were grown in monolayer culture with Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. the influenza strain A/Leningrad/134/17/1957 H2N2) was purchased from National Control Institute of Veterinary Bioproducts and Pharmaceuticals (Beijing, China) the stock cultures were prepared from supernatants of infected cells and stored at 80 \u00b0C. cellular toxicity of patchouli alcohol on MDCK cells was assessed by the MTT method. each assay was performed in eight replicates. the concentration of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir inhibited virus numbers by 50% (IC50) was determined from dose-response curves. each assay was performed in eight replicates. 3.7. anti-influenza A (H2N2) efficacy in mouse influenza model Kunming mice, weighing 18\u201322 g (6 weeks of age) were purchased from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute Animal Co., Ltd. the docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed by the general protocols in the Insight II 2005 software packages. the system was solvated in a large sphere of TIP3P water molecules [40] with the radius of 35.0. the MD trajectories were generated using a 1.0-fs time step. cells were grown in monolayer culture with Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. cells were plated out onto 96-well culture plates for cytotoxicity and anti-influenza assays. the maximum non-toxic concentration (TD0) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated by linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves generated from the data. each assay was performed in eight replicates after incubation for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C. enza A inhibition during the adsorption period, the same amount of influenza A (H2N2) was mixed with the drug and added to the cells immediately. after 1 h of adsorption at 37 \u00b0C, the inoculum was removed and DMEM supplemented with 2 % FCS were added to the cells. each assay was run in eight replicates. parameters for evaluation of antiviral activity included weight loss, reduction in mortality and/or increase in mean day to death (MDD) determined through 15 days. patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A virus activity via interference with the NA function that cleaves the -glycosidic bond between sialic acid and glycoconjugate."}
