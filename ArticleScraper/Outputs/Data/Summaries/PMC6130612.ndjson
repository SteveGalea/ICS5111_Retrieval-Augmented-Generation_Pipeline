{"summary": "Radix Bupleuri (Chai Hu in Chinese) is believed to be one of the most important herbal medicines in china. it has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for its effects of relieving exterior syndrome, clearing heat, regulating the liver-qi, and lifting yang-qi. many valuable and important activities of Radix Bupleuri have been discovered. they include anti-inflammatory (Xie et al. 2012), antitumor (Liu & Li 2014), antidepressant (Jin et al. 2013), antiviral (Chiang et al. 2013a), hepatoprotection (Wang et al. 2013a), immunoregulation (Ying et al. 2014), and neuromodulation activities. saikosaponins are oleanane type triterpenoid saponins. they are divided into seven types according to different aglycones. SSa, SSd, SSc and SSb2 are heterocyclic diene saikosaponin (type II) a, one of the most important active saikosaponins in Radix Bupleuri (Liang et al. 2014), plays a significant role in anti-inflammatory activities. the various pharmacological activities, mechanisms, models, and applications of SSa are given in Table 1. SSa down-regulates BMP-4 expression and inhibits hepatic stellate cell activation. macrophages RAW264.7 In vitro SSa regulates inflammatory mediators and suppresses the MAPK and NF-B signalling pathways. liver Sprague-Dawley rats In vivo SSa inhibits the expression of hepatic proinflammatory cytokines and NF-B signal pathway. oxLDL-induced activation of AKT and NF-kappaB, assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. antitumor activity Different cancer cells A549, SKOV3, HeLa and Siha In vitro SSa sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin through ROS -mediated apoptosis. cancer cell cytotoxicity (Wang et al. 2010a) Glioma C6 glioma cells In vitro SSa enhances the activities of GS and CNP. SSa inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), transforming growth factor-1R (TGF-1R), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8. SSa exerts inhibiting effect on inflammatory associated proteins and enzymes. NF-B pathway is an important signal pathway in inflammatory process. SSa attenuates inflammation by inhibiting the activation of NF-B pathway. inhibition effects are marked by triangle in Figure 4(a) neuroregulation activity SSa plays a significant role on neuroregulation. it exerts antiepileptic mainly by inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor current, persistent sodium current (Yu et al. 2012) and inactivating K+ current (Xie et al. 2013). it counteracts the inflammatory response and neurological function deficits via an anti-inflammatory response and inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway to ease nerve injury (Ma anti-tumor activity SSa exhibits antitumor activity in vitro. it sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin, such as human lung adenocarcinoma cells A549, ovarian cancer cells SKOV3 and cervix cancer cells Hela and Siha.
