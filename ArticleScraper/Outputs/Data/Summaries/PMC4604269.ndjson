{"summary": "the coronavirus is a worldwide threat. it has triggered the second largest outbreak outside the Middle East. experts still do not understand exactly how MERS is transmitted. journal editors prepared the current focused review series in this issue of Clinical Endoscopy. the authors want to explore the challenging and timely issues in order to share current knowledge and new technology. endoscopy disinfection is a prerequisite step for preventing contagious diseases. there are currently no countermeasures for unidentified organisms. there are currently no specific treatment or cure for the disease. the editors of Clinical Endoscopy want to explore the challenging and timely issues. they want to share current knowledge in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy. 186 people have been infected and 36 have died of MERS. microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, prion, and parasites are known to be disseminated during endoscopy. the incidence of exogenous infections linked to contaminated endoscope is very low, and estimated at one case per 1.8 million procedures. reprocessing is time consuming, labor intensive, somewhat expensive, and is, most importantly, susceptible to failure. a thorough manual pre-cleaning is essential to endoscopy disinfection. the elevator wire mechanism is difficult to access and not readily amenable to cleaning. endoscopic staff should be aware of the latest reprocessing guidelines. there were only two reports of nosocomial outbreaks due to Klebsiella spp. there is also the risk that we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg. most guidelines for endoscope reprocessing prescribe seven steps including pre-cleaning, cleaning, rinse, disinfection, rinse, drying (air/alcohol), and storage. failure to follow guidelines is the chief factor that compromises the safety of endoscope reprocessing. reprocessing is time consuming, labor intensive, somewhat expensive, and is, most importantly, susceptible to failure. correct cleaning of the elevator mechanism remains essential to endoscopy disinfection. the fixed distal ends require more accuracy during pre-cleaning. a thorough manual pre-cleaning is essential to the process of satisfactory disinfection. clinical endoscopy has published several reviews and original articles on the disinfection of the endoscope and its accessories. a special issue of clinical endoscopy presented at the 48th Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (KSGE) seminar held in 2013, two review articles summarized the presentation on GI endoscope reprocessing. disinfection is the main step in reprocessing in order to eliminate potential human pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or mycobacterium. a review of disinfectants that are currently available in Korea was published by the disinfectant management committee of the KSGE. the most common deviation from the guidelines was the transportation of the soiled endoscope after the procedure to the reprocessing room in sealed container. the non-compliance rates were followed by the leaking test and the inability to keep the exposure time and temperature in 16.2% and 12.6% of cases. the study showed significant improvements in the compliance to recommendations for reprocessing during the last decade. 102 samples were tested from two different duodenoscopes for bacterial growth. three samples were obtained each time, with one swab from tip before and another after manual disinfection. the third sample was collected by irrigation of the working channel with saline. the GI endoscope is associated with outbreaks related to incomplete reprocessing during high-level disinfection. the GI endoscope is an important risk factor for the transmission of CRE and other microorganisms."}
