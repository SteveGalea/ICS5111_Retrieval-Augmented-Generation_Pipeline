{"summary": "malaria had been virtually eliminated in Tajikistan in the early 1960s. before 1992 only 200\u2013300 malaria cases were reported annually (3). civil strife in 1992\u20131993 led to massive population displacement and deterioration in living conditions. 327 serologically confirmed cases in 21 of 29 municipalities (8). the population fled their villages because of bombings, and on their return several weeks later, they found destroyed buildings, contaminated food stores and wells, and a greatly increased rodent population. the outbreak of marburg hemorrhagic fever in angola from October 2004 through July 2005 was the largest recorded to date. a total of 410 cases occurred with a CFR of 30% (Ministry of Health Sierra Leone and WHO, unpub. data). the number of cases has been decreasing since the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy in the national malaria treatment protocol in 2003. the number of cases has been decreasing since the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy in the national malaria treatment protocol in 2003. inadequate Surveillance and early warning and response systems are often weak in conflict situations. limited laboratory facilities and lack of expertise in specimen collection may delay confirmation of the causative organism. outbreak of marburg hemorrhagic fever in Durba in northeastern DRC from October 1998 through September 2000 was the first large outbreak in rural areas under natural conditions. in 2000, alerts of a relapsing fever outbreak were received within 1 week. the outbreak was contained within 2 weeks, resulting in only 154 cases and 8 deaths. conflict can hamper access to populations for timely delivery of supplies. immunization campaigns vaccinated 8.1 million children 5 years of age in 2005. 154 cases were reported in 2004\u20132005 outbreak. resurgence began with 1990 epidemic in Cameroon, then spread into conflict-affected west africa. drug resistance was observed in 18% of newly diagnosed sputum-positive TB patients compared with 5% (and no multidrug resistance) in nonrefugee populations. 14.5% of patients defaulted treatment (33), which is almost double the acceptable default rate limit for TB control programs in such settings. aid workers and British soldiers have imported Lassa fever into the Netherlands (2000) and the United Kingdom. there is also a hypothetical possibility aid workers returning from a containment zone may introduce the virus causing this pandemic into conflict settings. this introduction may reduce the time for preparedness, which can lead to increased illness, death, and social disruption in these already vulnerable populations. inea, liberia, and Sierra Leone in the 1990s led to >2 million displaced persons. displaced people are likely to have provided new opportunities for rodents to proliferate when people were forced to abandon villages and relocate in overcrowded camps. but numbers of new cases related to the conflict are unavailable. the EHF outbreak in Kikwit, DRC, was the second largest to date with 315 cases and had a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 81% (10). before infection control procedures were instituted in the hospital, 79 healthcare workers were infected compared with only 1 afterwards. 79 healthcare workers were infected compared with only 1 afterwards. a total of 50% of the cases-patients were 15 years of age. the average CFR for Lassa fever is 1% and can be as high as 15% in hospitalized patients (15). During outbreaks, the CFR can reach 50% among hospitalized patients (7). despite intensification of control measures, all major outbreaks in 2005 occurred in conflict-affected countries (Angola, DRC, and southern Sudan) despite intensification of control measures, all major outbreaks in 2005 occurred in conflict-affected countries. outbreak was confirmed on may 6 and an international team arrived at the government\u2019s request on may 8. only 8 cases were laboratory confirmed, and 68 were identified retrospectively by the team, which left after 3 weeks (21). Sporadic cases continued to occur until September 2000, although data were collected retrospectively by a second international team. in polio vaccination coverage for the required 3 polio doses is only 35% in 2005 (25) 14 of the 19 regions in Somalia were affected with 215 cases (26) by September 2006, 14 of the 19 regions in Somalia were affected with 215 cases (26). by January 2005, a total of 105 cases had been confirmed in 17 of the 26 states in Sudan. 50% of patients complied with 5-day antimicrobial drug treatment. refugee populations had higher anti-tuberculosis drug resistance rates than nonrefugee populations in northeastern Kenya. drug resistance to >1 drug was observed in 18% of newly diagnosed sputum-positive TB patients. efforts in postconflict Sierra Leone have placed aid workers, peacekeeping forces, and businessmen at risk for contracting Lassa fever. an imported case of Lassa fever was confirmed in Germany in 2006. a businessman died of Lassa fever in 2004 after traveling between Sierra Leone and liberia before his illness. the technical capacity of all humanitarian health partners and ministries of health should be enhanced to ensure effective implementation of infectious disease interventions. this implementation can be achieved through availability of internationally accepted standards, guidelines, and tools adapted to conflict situations. building the capacity of national staff must be an integral part of program implementation. a rapid response mechanism for investigation alerts and implementation of control measures are crucial. conflict-affected countries represent one of the weakest links in global health security. military forces are increasingly implementing aid programs for conflict-affected populations."}
