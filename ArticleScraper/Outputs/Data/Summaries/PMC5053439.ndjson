{"summary": "RVFV is an arbovirus and circulates between mosquito vectors and ruminants in endemic areas. it causes high mortality rates in young ruminants and a high rate of abortions in pregnant ruminants. the majority of patients show influenza-like symptoms but few develop hemorrhagic fever, neurological symptoms, and ocular disease. nonstructural protein NSs is a phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 31 kDa. in the nucleus, NSs forms filament-like structures by self-dimerization through its C-terminal domain. NSs binds to Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30), a subunit of a co-repressor complex. a series of NSs mutants lack a specific biological function but retain other functions. the lack of these mutants has prevented a detailed mechanistic analysis of each biological function of the NSs. pProT7-S encoding antiviral-sense S RNA [24] served as a template. the NSs coding region of pProT7-S was amplified by using primers carrying Mfe I or a Not I site. the PCR fragment was cloned into EcoR I and the not I site of a pCAGGS plasmid.

NSs protein in veroE6 cells infected with MP-12 were significantly lower than those in MP-12 infected cells. levels of NSs protein accumulation were similar to that in MP-12 infected cells. infected cells were mock infected or infected with MP-12 or MP-12 mutants. strong signals of fluorescent-labeled RNA were observed in the nucleus of mock-infected cells and MP-12NSs-infected cells. in contrast, MP-12-infected cells showed weaker fluorescent signals, demonstrating an inhibition of host transcription by NSs. fluorescent intensity observed in cells infected with virus carrying mutation M250T, R16H or A75E in NSs was similar to that in MP-12-infected cells. incorporated 5EU were visualized by using Alexa fluor 488 conjugated azide (5EU) viral N protein was stained by anti-N antibody followed by Alexa fluor 594 conjugated secondary antibody (N protein) fluorescence microscopic analysis was performed to detect newly synthesized RNAs in infected cells. flow cytometry analysis was used to quantitatively measure levels of 5EU-labeled RNAs in MP-12-M250K-infected cells and in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells. most cells were found in quadrant 3 (Q3) and Q4 respectively, demonstrating active host transcription in the latter, but not in the latter (Fig 2B-a and 2B-b). the percentage of MP-12-M250K-infected cells with low transcription activity was 43.0% (Q1/Q1+Q2), while in the MP-12 samples, it was 56.6%. the inhibitory activity of MP-12-M250K was weaker than that of MP-12. culture supernatants were collected at various times p.i. titers were determined by plaque assays. morphology of the MP-12 and mutant viruses in veroE6 cells at 3 day p.i. MP-12, MP-12-M250K and MP-12-R16H/M250K had similar replication kinetics, regardless of their differential ability to induce cytotoxicity. amounts of p53 protein significantly increased in MP-12-infected cells, but not in MP-12NSs-infected cells. whole-cell lysate was harvested at 8 h p.i. and subjected to Western blot analysis. le May et al. proposed that interaction of NSs with SAP30 interferes with the recruitment of co-activator protein CBP at activation sites on the IFN- promotor. MP-12-R16H/M250K replicated better than MP-12NSs. MRC-5 cells were infected with MP-12 or its mutants at an m.o.i of 3. Total RNA was collected at various time p.i. as indicated. at 16 h post transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation by using anti-V5 antibody. precipitates were examined by using Western blotting with anti-V5 tag antibody or anti-Flag tag antibody. anti-V5 antibody did not co-precipitate wt NSs along with V5-tagged Venus. NSs-R16H/M250K was unable to completely block IFN- transcription. effects of mutations in NSs on host transcription inhibition activity. whole-cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells described above. whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. lysates were mock infected (Mock) or infected with MP-12 or its mutants. anti-p62 antibody (third panel) and anti-Flag tag antibody (second panel) western blotting analysis of input lysates using anti-p62 antibody (top panel) and anti-flag tag antibody (bottom panel) top two panels show Western blotting of the input lysates. XO3, a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase, leads to p62 degradation. we first examined the abundance of TFIIH components in infected cells. there was no substantial reduction in the abundance of these TFIIH components in cells infected with MP-12, or MP-12-M250K at 16 h p.i. wt NSs and both mutant NSs were co-immunoprecipitated with p44 and p62. the binding efficiencies of NSs-M250K for p44 and p62 were lower than those for wt NSs. NSs-R16H/M250K did not induce degradation regardless of its ability to bind to p62. p44 p62 FBXO3 Binding Binding Binding Binding Degradation Binding wtNSs Strong + + + NSs-M250K Moderate + + + NSs-R16H/M250K No inhibition + + - + Virulence of MP-12-R16H/M250K and MP-12-M250K in young mice NSs is a major virulence factor of RVFV. the mice were observed for 22 days after inoculation. the mutant virus is deficient for efficient virus genome co-packaging due to a large deletion in the 5\u2019 untranslated region of M RNA segment. nucleotide and amino acid mutations in the NSs gene of uncloned and plaque-cloned passage 18 virus were found in the uncloned viruses. the mutation was absent in the plaque-cloned viruses. infected cells were mock infected (Mock) or infected with MP-12 or MP-12 mutants. infected cells were harvested at 16 h p.i. and analyzed in Western blots. levels of RNA synthesis in virus-infected cells were measured by labeling with 5EU from 16 h to 17 h p.i. fluorescent intensity observed in cells infected with virus carrying mutation M250T, R16H or A75E in NSs was similar to that in MP-12-infected cells. in contrast, cells infected with MP-12-R16H/M250K had bright fluorescent signals, whose intensities were similar to those in mock-infected cells. 5EU and anti-N antibody were used to label newly synthesized RNAs and N proteins. cells were subjected to Flow cytometric analysis. the density plot was divided into four quadrants. in all infected samples, 86.8\u201393.4% of cells were RVFV N protein positive (Q1+Q2) the level of 5EU-labeled RNA in MP-12NSs-infected cells was similar to that in mock-infected cells. MP-12-infected cells showed lower levels of 5EU-labeled RNA compared with those in MP-12NSs-infected cells. MP-12-R16H/M250K replication suppressed host protein synthesis. NSs-R16H/M250K exerted inefficient transcription suppression activity. all viruses replicated efficiently with similar replication kinetics in vero E6 cells. anti-p53 antibody, anti-MP-12 antibody and anti-actin antibody were used as the primary antibody for the top, middle and bottom panels. MP-12 formed clear plaques in vero E6 cells, whereas MP-12-R16H/M250K and MP-12-M250K formed turbid-type plaques like MP-12NSs. both of the mutant viruses were less cytotoxic than MP-12. p53 accumulation occurred in MP-12-M250K-infected cells. accumulation levels were lower than those in MP-12-M250K-infected cells. effects of NSs mutations in NSs on PKR degradation. MP-12-R16H/M250K replicated as efficiently as did MP-12 in MRC-5 cells. low levels of IFN- mRNA accumulation occurred in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells. mrs-R16H/M250K replicated as efficiently as did MP-12 in MRC-5 cells. mRNA was detected by Northern blotting analysis using the IFN- mRNA-specific RNA probe. MRC-5 cells were infected with each virus at an m.o.i. of 0.01. culture supernatants were collected at various times p.i. both NSs mutants formed filament-like structures in the nucleus. the expressed NSs protein was co-localized with wt NSs and both mutated NSs in the filaments. anti-V5 antibody co-precipitated wt NSs along with V5-tagged SAP30. NSs showed different levels of transcriptional suppression activities in virus-infected cells. NSs-R16H/M250K expression did not inhibit luciferase activity. NSs-R16H/M250 and NSs-M250K were also distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. whole-cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p62 antibody and anti-p44 antibody, anti-XPD antibody, anti-MP-12 antibody or anti-actin antibody as primary antibodies. at 8 h p.i., cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation by using anti-p44 antibody (third panel) NSs mutants were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-V5 antibody. at 8 h p.i., precipitates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-V5 antibody. NSs binds to p44, a subunit of TFIIH, and interferes with the formation of the TFIIH complex. the same results were obtained when viruses carrying Flag-tagged NSs were used. cells infected with MP-12 or its mutants were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-p44 antibody. anti-p44 antibody co-immunoprecipitated wt NSs and both mutant NSs along with p62, demonstrating binding of the mutant NSs proteins to p62. NSs-R16H/M250K did not induce p62 degradation regardless of its ability to bind to p62. cells transiently expressing the V5-tagged FBXO3/1 were mock infected or infected with MP-12-NSs-Flag, MP-12-M250K-Flag or MP-12-R16/M250K-Flag. MP-12 is known as an attenuated strain, but the intraperitoneal inoculation of 104 PFU of MP-12 into 18-day-old CD1 mice resulted in the death of 55% of the mice within 13 days p.i. no obvious clinical signs, including neurological symptoms, were observed. NSs-M250K exhibited a partially reduced activity to inhibit general transcription. the results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that a reduced amount of NSs-M250K co-precipitated with SAP30, p62 and p44. however, the slightly impaired ability of NSs-M250K to inhibit general transcription could not be solely attributed to the lower binding efficiency of NSs-M250K to p44. NSs-R16H/M250K replication induced low levels of IFN- mRNA synthesis. the level of the IFN- mRNA was significantly lower than that in MP-12NSs-infected cells. NSs-SAP30 interaction and NSs-induced general host transcriptional suppression function are both necessary for efficient inhibition of IFN- mRNA transcription. coding a reporter gene in place of the NSs gene causes less prominent cytopathic effects than MP-12 replication. MP-12 replication induces NSs-dependent p53 stabilization, which contributes to virus-induced cell death. however, it was unclear which function of the NSs contributed to the induction of the p53-mediated cytotoxicity. 55% of 18-day-old CD1 mice died after intraperitoneal inoculation with 104 PFU within 13 days p.i.. intraperitoneal inoculation of MP-12 into severe combined immune deficiency mice also caused 100% mortality. both mutant viruses caused less severe cytopathic effects and cytotoxicity than did MP-12 in cultured cells. experiments using RVFV mutants, carrying the M250K single mutation and the R16H/M250K double mutation, would yield valuable information about the role of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition. the full-length NSs gene of the uncloned passage 18 viruses had M250K, M250T, K202N and D100G mutations. in the cells infected with MP-12 carrying NSs with a D100G mutation, the accumulation of NSs was poor. the remaining three clones carried NSs with a M250K mutation. lysed using the lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail) followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. resulting supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction (C)"}
