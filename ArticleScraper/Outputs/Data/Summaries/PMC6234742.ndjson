{"summary": "mass gatherings are divided into different types based on their purpose. one of the health challenges of mass gatherings is the prevalence of infectious diseases and the outbreak of diseases. planners must also pay attention to these factors in preparation 1, 5\u20137. the number of Iranian pilgrims taking part in the arbaeen ceremony was 2,320,000 16. the ceremony is held on the 40 th day after the anniversary of imam's martyrdom, the third Shiite Imam. study was to explore challenges of health system preparedness for communicable diseases in arbaeen ceremony. a qualitative research method with the approach of conventional content analysis was used 18. the cultural practices of the participants, especially those surrounding health, differ during the Arbaeen ceremony. inclusion criteria included the existence of practical experience in planning or participate in Arbaeen ceremony, the ability to communicate and willingness to participate in the research. AK conducted the interviews, AK and DKZ transcribed the data. AK and DKZ and ZGH performed rigor. questions were transcribed verbatim and then typed up using Microsoft Word. meaning units were a collection of words and sentences that were related to each other in terms of content and were grouped together. the key points and subjects were extracted as open codes. researchers used trustworthiness criteria recommended by Guba and Lincoln to establish rigor 22. credibility was established by prolonged engagement of researchers with participants. research team also retained raw data, codes, and themes for control of reliability. study was conducted using in-depth interviews, based on stakeholder\u2019s experiences in Iraq-Iran land terminals. participants were selected among executive managers and policymakers of the ministry of health and medical education. participants selected from the ministry of health and medical education, medical training and treatment. AK conducted the interviews, AK and DKZ transcribed the data. the data was collected using audio recorders with permission from the participants. AK conducted the interviews, AK and DKZ transcribed the data. study was approved by ethics committee of Shahid Beheshti university of medical sciences on 10/08/2017, No. IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1396.349. interviews were conducted and recorded with participants' consent. verbal consent was taken from participants to participate in the study. all authors engaged in the environment and field of research. credibility was established by the prolonged engagement of researchers with participants. researcher triangulation was also used to verify the accuracy of the coding process. theme of \u201clow perception of risk in pilgrims\u201d had three sub-themes. the theme of \u201clow perception of risk in pilgrims\u201d had three sub-themes. the theme of \u201cineffectiveness of health education\u201d had two sub-themes. the biggest issue with the prevention of communicable diseases in the Arbaeen ceremony is pilgrim-based education. educating pilgrims can directly help people to create or reform health infrastructures in Iraq. the main point of training is to determine the targeted group at the level of pilgrims and health directors. the health system is weak in Iraq because health rules are not enforced and there is no supervision for these centers. pilgrims should be familiar with the kind of health culture in Iraq so they can develop a program to prevent contagious diseases. in Iran, eating food with the hands is part of the food culture. identifying these factors helps pilgrims and planners to prevent infectious diseases. the health system needs facilities such as equipped laboratories to diagnose and treat infectious diseases in a timely manner. there is a need to correctly pass the treatment period of infectious diseases in order to prevent epidemics. the arbaeen pilgrimage has special features that distinguish it from other mass gatherings. the population of Arbaeen pilgrims and its time of year are changeable. lack of attention to the risks of the ceremony is one of the challenges of the health system. unhealthy and dangerous practices, such as unsanitary food consumption, are not understood by pilgrims. respect for personal and public health, such as hand washing, providing food from health food centers and avoiding overeating, is effective in preventing digestive diseases. participants believed one of the health challenges is belief in destiny and fatalism. training courses should be held separately for each of the groups, pilgrims, executive managers, and policymakers, and at a proper time before Arbaeen. most of the participants believed that training should be fitted with pilgrims' needs and respond to pilgrims' problems. the theme of \u201chealth infrastructure defection in Iraq\u201d had three sub-themes. the theme of \u201clow perception of risk in pilgrims\u201d had three sub-themes. the theme of \u201cineffectiveness of health education\u201d had two sub-themes. screening The impossibility of requirement flu vaccination The probability of a bioterrorism agent coming to Iran Lack of attention to emerging and reversible illnesses Inattention to the animated crowd of pilgrims Omitting the existence of various hazards during the trip Low perception of risk in pilgrims Lack of awareness in pilgrims Lack of knowledge about personal and public health Lack of knowledge about proper nutrition Refuse to take medication Fatalism in pilgrims Belief on no need for travel planning for Arbaeen ceremony. tuff distribution is not under the supervision of a special organization. lack of a trustee or supervisor in the health system can prevent delivery and distribution of unsafe food. lack of food evaluation and supervision system can lead to gastroenteric disease. health system weakness, incomplete health service implementation and insufficient supervision of environment health are indicative of the weakness of the health infrastructure. failure to implement health services has led to failure in meeting health conditions. many participants have identified underlying factors of infectious diseases as one of the challenges affecting the preparedness of the health system. syndromic surveillance system can be used to diagnose infectious diseases. there is a need to correctly pass the treatment period in order to prevent epidemics. the requirement of pilgrims to vaccinate is always up to the host country. the pilgrimage has special features that distinguish it from other mass gatherings. participants believed that one of the health challenges is belief in destiny and fatalism. most pilgrims who participate in the arbaeen walking ceremony have a relatively low understanding of the dangers and diseases. the pilgrims' low awareness of health hazards, such as not using personal hygiene products, is the cause of infectious diseases in the pilgrims. low perception of danger in pilgrims is sometimes seen as insanitary beliefs in preventing medication consumption and disregarding hygiene recommendations. ineffectiveness of health education Training shortage in the targeted group. one of the present challenges is the quantitative and qualitative shortage in the stakeholder\u2019s training level. the aim of this study was to explore the challenges of health system preparedness for infectious diseases in the arbaeen ceremony as the first qualitative study in Iran. ineffectiveness of health training is one of the challenges of health system preparedness in dealing with infectious diseases in the arbaeen ceremony. religious ceremonies are rooted in people's beliefs and have great popularity. people-centered education therefore has great potential to reduce gap between knowledge and practice in pilgrims. a personal health training plan should be included in the pilgrims' training plan. public health training such as vaccination, environmental health, monitoring donations, monitoring donations, controlling bioterrorism and establishing mobile toilets should be considered in executives and policymakers' preparedness plan. study aimed at assessing knowledge, attitude and performance of pilgrims on using antibiotics in Hajj showed that they did not have proper understanding of using these drugs and used medications arbitrarily. a lack of understanding of health instructions and disregard for public and personal health in any situation can endanger human health. arbaeen ceremony is held based on the lunar calendar and so its needs and challenges differ and are dependent on the season that the ceremony is held. if the ceremony is held in cold seasons, respiratory diseases are more common and if is held in hot seasons, the majority of infectious diseases are of the digestive system. the health system in Iraq seems somewhat weak, given that the arbaeen ceremony is of particular popularity among Shia Muslims. in recent years, numerous health facilities have been constructed on religious places, as well as along the path of pilgrimage using pilgrims' donations."}
