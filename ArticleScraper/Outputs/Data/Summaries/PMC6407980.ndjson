{"summary": "Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a classic tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission. clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease remain unclear. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib, STI571) is the first approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the frontline treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML. common side effects include lung injury and repair, loss of stem cells from epithelial surfaces, and drug-associated cell injury. ib was initiated and tolerated well by the patient 3 months after treatment. the patient showed a complete hematological response and major molecular response with 4.836% BCR-ABL found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 3 months after treatment. the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. repeated examinations for acid-fast bacilli in the sputum provided negative results. pulmonary CT performed 9 months after the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis shows no improvement. RT-PCR showed a BCR-ABL level of 4.036%. nilotinib was administered as an alternative drug 1 week later. Imatinib is the first clinically used TKI for the treatment of CML. the mechanism by which it causes lung injury or ILD remains unclear. tests for rheumatism showed negative results. nilotinib is an analog of imatinib and can block BCR-ABL kinase. it can block BCR-ABL kinase with a 20-fold higher intensity. a previous study showed that lung abnormalities caused by imatinib could be reversed approximately 3 months after switching to nilotinib. the severity of imatinib-induced lung damage seems to be time-dependent. however, the exact treatment duration that can cause irreversible damage remains unclear. the possible reason was the long-term use of imatinib for >9 months."}
