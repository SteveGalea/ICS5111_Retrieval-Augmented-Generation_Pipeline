R20PC; polysulfone translucent amber, catalog no. R20PLF; Bellmore, NY) or Lab Products (polycarbonate translucent blue, catalog no. 80778CC; polycarbonate translucent red, catalog no. 18780M; Seaford, DE) all cages had identical stainless steel lids (catalog no. 10SS, Ancare) for cradling food and the correlated color temperature was measured by using a chromameter (model CL-200A, Konica-Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) the 4 cage types (clear, amber, blue, and red) were held in place, upside-down, covering the cosine receptor foreoptic attachment used for irradiance measurements. dark-phase sampling was performed in less than 1 min under 1 or 2 safelight red lamps. exposure at rodent eye level was 45 to 179.5 W/cm2, depending on the use of 1 or 2 lights and the position of the light(s) during sampling. plasma melatonin levels were measured by using a melatonin 125I-radioimmunoassay kit. melatonin levels were measured by using 0.125 mL of plasma. for the 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 time points, 0.25 mL of plasma were pooled to make a total of 0.5 mL. sensitivity for corticosterone, insulin, and leptin were 4.5 ng/mL, 0.124 ng/mL, and 10 pg/mL, respectively. lower limits of detection for corticosterone, inulin, and leptin were 15 ng/mL, 0.15 ng/mL, and 10 pg/mL. power distribution was divided into 100-nm bins for the red and clear cages. irradiance for clear cages was 8.4%, 3.4%, and 9.8% greater than that for the blue, amber, and red cages. all cages were of equal dimensions (19 in. 10.5 in. 8 in.; wall thickness, 0.1 in.). values are plotted as light irradiance (W/cm2) and wavelength (nm). a third measurement, taken after opening and closing the lid, revealed greater than 6000 ppm CO2 and 37.2% O2 respectively. melatonin concentrations were low (less than 25 pg/mL) from 0800 to 2000 for all groups. areas under the curve for amber, blue, clear, and red cages were 436 pg/mL, 587 pg/mL, 337 pg/mL, and 499 pg/mL, respectively. the dark phase (1800 to 0600) is designated by dark bars. total fatty acid concentrations (g/mL; mean SEM) were the sums of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids. no significant differences were found between rats in any tinted compared with clear cages. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats maintained for 6 wk (12:12 light:dark; lights on, 0600) in either translucent clear (black triangles), amber (amber circles), blue (blue squares) or red (red triangles) rodent cages and on free-choice water and standard rodent chow. asterisks indicate concentrations that are significantly (P 0.05) different from those of rats in clear cages. amber group's peak corticosterone level was phase-delayed 8 h. red group's peak coincided with the clear group's first peak at 2000. corticosterone peak in the red group was significantly (P 0.05) lower than that of the clear group at 0400. blue group's first (and higher) peak (2.7 0.4 ng/mL) was at 1600, corresponding to but significantly (P 0.05) higher than the clear group's first peak (1.2 0.2 ng/mL) the second insulin peak of the blue-caged rats was phase-delayed 4 h. at 1200, plasma insulin concentrations differed significantly (P 0.05) between the amber and blue groups. 1600 in all groups and did not differ between them. only the leptin value of the amber group was significantly (P 0.05) lower than that of controls at 2000. all cages were of equal dimensions (19 in. 10.5 in. 8 in.; wall thickness, 0.1 in.). values are plotted as light irradiance and wavelength (nm) atmospheric CO2 inside the anesthesia chamber was greater than 6000 ppm within 1 min, and atmospheric O2 measured 24.1% respectively. a third measurement, taken after opening and closing the lid, revealed greater than 6000 ppm CO2 and 37.2% O2. a phase advance was a shift in a group peak level to an earlier time point. the dark phase (1800 to 0600) is designated by dark bars. plasma total fatty acids showed a significant rhythm, almost identical between groups. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats maintained for 6 wk (12:12 light:dark; lights on, 0600) total fatty acid values were sums of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids. no significant differences between rats in any tinted compared with clear cages were found at any time point. urnal changes in (A) plasma glucose and (B) lactic acid levels (mg/dL and mmol/L, respectively; mean SEM) of male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats maintained for 6 wk (12:12 light:dark; lights on, 0600) in either translucent clear (black triangles), amber (amber circles), blue (blue squares), or red (red triangles) rodent cages. the blue group's peak corticosterone level was phase-delayed 8 h. the blue group's peak was phase-delayed 4 h and did not have a second peak. the corticosterone peak in the red group was significantly (P 0.05) lower than that of the clear group at 0400. the blue group's first (and higher) peak (2.7 0.4 ng/mL) was at 1600, corresponding to but significantly (P 0.05) higher than the clear group's first peak (1.2 0.2 ng/mL) the second insulin peak of the blue-caged rats was phase-delayed 4 h (0400) and was significantly (P 0.05) different from that of the clear group. the nadir occurred at 1600 in all groups and did not differ between them. only the leptin value of the amber group was significantly lower than that of controls at 2000. all tinted-caging groups differed from the clear-cage group at 2400 time point. the circadian rhythm of plasma total fatty acids was not affected by cage-color exposure in rats with free access to food and water. the rhythm in the current study was identical to that of previous experiments in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats showed 2 peaks during the dark phase. lactate is no longer considered to be a waste product only. lactate has proven to be important in wound repair and regeneration. a single sharp peak in insulin concentration occurred during the middark phase in the clear controls. the blue cage group evinced a secondary sharp peak at the end of the light phase. a link exists between leptin and insulin; often they are increased under conditions such as insulinomas. albino rats lack melanin in the eyes, hair, and skin. lack of melanin results in abnormal development of retinal pigmented epithelium, central retina, and rods. ipRGC development or melanopsin levels or function were affected in albino rats. lactate and insulin peak concentrations in the red group were lower than rats in clear cages. the leptin peak was significantly higher than rats in clear cages. cage tint causes significant circadian disruptions."}
