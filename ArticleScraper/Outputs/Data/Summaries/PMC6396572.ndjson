{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a beta-coronavirus distinct from but genetically related to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013, de Wit et al. 2016) there has been continuing concern about the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV. to assess and anticipate potential epidemic spread, it is essential to better understand the virology; human clinical characteristics, possible therapeutic and preventive options. the first known MERS-CoV cases were from Jordan (confirmed retrospectively, and the source is still unknown) about 80% of MERS-CoV cases originate from or passed through Saudi Arabia. inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed primary research articles about MERS-CoV published between 2012 and mid-juy 2017. only English language publications (or with an English-language abstract available) were included. coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, approximately spherical, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with genome length 26\u201332 kilobases (kb) of the four described coronavirus genera, alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are believed to originate from bat species. gamma- and delta-coronaviruses are believed to be of avian origin. the main route of entry for MERS-CoV is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on the host cell surface (Raj et al. 2013, Raj et al. 2013, 2014) the virus readily replicates in human lung, Huh-7, and the widely used Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cell lines. goat, camel (Eckerle et al. 2014), and equid origin cell lines (Meyer et al. 2015), but was not detected in cattle, sheep, or rodent cell lines. several bat cell lines have been tested to determine if they could support MERS-CoV replication (M\u00fcller et al. 2012, Cai et al. 2014, Eckerle et al. 2014) rhesus macaques (de Wit et al. 2013, Munster et al. 2013, Yao et al. 2014); camels (Barlan et al. 2014); horses (Barlan et al. 2014); and alpacas (Adney et al. 2016). PCR primer sets to regions upstream of the E gene are most frequently used, with ORF1a or ORF1b for confirmation. serologic samples are usually screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then by the gold standard plaque-reduction neutralization test or microneutralization (CDC 2014), but now recommend going directly to microneutralization assay (CDC 2014, revised). however, there are pitfalls in serology, including cross-reactivity and false negatives. the incubation period is 5\u20137 days (in some cases up to 12 days) fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia (with abnormal chest radiography) are the most frequently noted signs. myalgia, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills or rigors, or malaise are also seen. most cases in Saudi Arabia have occurred among men, ages 45 or older. Mortality was more frequent and rapid in individuals with comorbidities. more severe disease has been associated with higher viral load. both were apparently healthy before infection and in their 30s. infection during the third trimester may be associated with better fetal outcomes. but the numbers are too small to generalize. innate immunity, including IFNs and cytokines, and cellular immunity by CD8+ (presumably \u201ckiller\u201d) T cells may play important roles in host defense and recovery. innate immunity, including IFNs and cytokines, may play important roles in host defense and recovery. in vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV could downregulate expression of IFN-stimulated gene subsets. another study found that MERS-CoV may cause delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines together with suppression of the host's innate antiviral response. 44 patients with severe MERS (requiring ventilatory support), treatment with ribavirin and pegylated IFN 2a (note, not 2b) appeared to increase short-term survival (14 days) by 28 days only 10 of the patients were still living (6/20 survivors in treated group compared with 4/24 in the comparison group) -throughput screening and other methods have identified additional promising compounds in several classes. these include inhibitors against both viral (Kilianski et al. 2013, Lei et al. 2014) and host (Gierer et al. 2015) proteases needed to process the virus. a replication defective full-length cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome has been developed for identifying future vaccine candidates. sporadic nature of human MERS-CoV infection and difficulty of identifying suitable animal models make controlled trials difficult. a serological study of 10,009 individuals in Saudi Arabia found 15 seropositive for MERS-CoV, 7 of whom were occupationally camel-exposed (shepherds and slaughterhouse workers) the source of infection for most primary cases remains unknown as only clinical cases or those found through contact tracing are generally identified. the main known exposures are health care-associated infections and contact with camels. the main known exposures are health care-associated infections and contact with camels. the mechanisms for the introduction of the virus into human populations are poorly understood. in the 2014 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, one study analyzed 191 symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV. 20.9% were health care workers (additional infected health care workers were asymptomatic) in a cluster of 9 MERS-CoV cases in Jordan, 6 were health care workers at the outbreak hospital. in the environment, reported recoverable on surfaces after 48 h at 20\u00b0C and 48% relative humidity and for at least 12 h at 30\u00b0C with 30% humidity. RNA was found on environmental surfaces, including bedsheets and medical equipment. there were apparently few reports of infections in hospital laundry or maintenance workers, contrary to what would be expected for environmental transmission. family clusters were identified in a number of these reports. at most only a small percentage of contacts became cases. there is relatively little information on asymptomatic individuals, most of whom are detected by contact tracing. one model suggested an R0 of 3.5\u20136.7 in Jeddah and 2.0\u20132.8 in Riyadh. the risk of secondary transmission following an imported MERS-CoV case is 22.7% (95% CI: 19.2\u201325.1%), with the risks of generations 2, 3, and 4 estimated to be 10.5%, 6.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. the animal interface and search for natural and reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV Dromedary camels are the only documented zoonotic source of human infection. there is considerable circumstantial evidence supporting camel-to-human transmission, including evidence of camels and humans becoming infected with an identical MERS-CoV. critics have suggested that the identical sequences may be due to cross-contamination. there is a critical need for clearer definitions and measurements of \u201ccamel exposure\u201d and to standardize methodology. evidence to date indicates that MERS-like coronaviruses have been circulating in camels since 1983. rELISA 189 159 (84.1) MNT 153 (81.0) Egypt, Sudan, others (Ali et al. 2017a) 2015\u20132016 MNT 1031 871 (84.5)b Ethiopia (Reusken et al. 2014b) 2010\u20132011 S1 microarray 188 181 (96.3)c Jordan (Reusken et al. 2014b) 2013 Nt 11 11 (100.0) Kenya (Corman et al. 2014b) 2010\u2013 seroprevalence reported higher in camels imported from Sudan (543/594; 88.7%) than resident (257/339; 5.8%); total 41/1078 nasal swabs reported PCR positive, 35/41 from Sudan. increasing genomic evidence suggests a diversity of coronaviruses in camels throughout the Middle East and Africa, including in major source countries for camel imports to the Middle East. one study found 15 seropositive alpacas, which are members of the camelid family, in Qatar. experimentally infected alpacas in one study demonstrated upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding, and transmission to other alpacas. one study suggests that MERS-CoV may have arisen from intraspike recombination between two ancestral coronaviruses. the virus has not been isolated from a bat, although a portion of MERS-CoV RNA sequence apparently was identified in a bat. alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are believed to originate from bat species. gamma- and delta-coronaviruses are believed to be of avian origin. there are two main recognized clades (genetic sublineages) of MERS-CoV. dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) is used by the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein (Chen et al. 2013, Raj et al. 2013, 2014) the virus readily replicates in human lung, Huh-7, and the widely used Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cell lines. several bat cell lines have been tested to determine if they could support MERS-CoV replication. the virus was reported to replicate well (roughly comparable with growth in Vero E6 cells) in kidney and lung cells from Rousettus aegyptiacus and other old world pteropid (fruit) bats. rhesus macaques (de Wit et al. 2013, Munster et al. 2013, Yao et al. 2014); camels (Barlan et al. 2014); horses (Barlan et al. 2014), and alpacas (Adney et al. 2016). there is no animal model that clearly mimics human clinical MERS. serologic samples are usually screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) if the sample is ELISA positive, CDC and other agencies formerly recommended confirmatory testing. other serological tests such as pseudoparticle neutralization (Perera et al. 2013), array-based serology (Reusken et al. 2013a) have also been developed. PCR primer sets to regions upstream of the E gene are most frequently used. Sensitivity was reported as 3.4 viral gene copies/25 L reaction for up-E and 64 copies for ORF1b. commercial kits are available, with comparable results reported. fluorescence assay (IFA) and then by the gold standard plaque-reduction neutralization test or microneutralization (CDC 2014, revised) but now recommend going directly to microneutralization assay (CDC 2014, revised) other serological tests such as pseudoparticle neutralization and array-based serology (Reusken et al. 2013a) have also been developed. a review of 939 cases in Saudi Arabia found that CFR increases with age, from 12.5% among those 19 years or younger to 86.2% among those 80 years or older. most cases in Saudi Arabia have occurred among men, ages 45 or older and those living in areas of lower relative humidity and high temperature. more severe disease has been associated with higher viral load (Feikin et al. 2015). there are a handful of case reports on MERS outcomes in other vulnerable populations, including three cases in pregnant women and one in an HIV-positive individual. antibody kinetics study with 17 patients in south Korea found that most patients produced a robust neutralizing IgG antibody response beginning at about 2 weeks and peaking by about 3 weeks. Detectable neutralizing antibody titers (20) have been reported in some patients up to 34 months. a number of viruses have been reported to be permissive for replication. a challenge to overcome is the effect of the virus on host defenses. the virus has been reported to inhibit host innate immunity. two case reports have documented the use of a combination of ribavirin and IFN 2b as a therapy for MERS-CoV patients, with divergent results. in one report, this therapy was given to five patients but all five died. however, all five patients had comorbidities and were diagnosed late in the course of their illness. human convalescent sera containing neutralizing antibodies conferred dose-dependent protection in a mouse model. the readily available sera from MERS-immune camels apparently were also an effective treatment for MERS-infected mice and reduced the severity of pathological changes in murine lung tissue. a human (and possibly camel) vaccine for MERS-CoV should be a key priority. a number of other antigens, some in viral vectors, have been tested. a replication defective full-length cDNA clone of the genome has been developed for identifying future vaccine candidates. there are reports of strong antibody responses (Haagmans et al. 2016) but it has been suggested that the presence of neutralizing antibodies may not be protective in camels or humans. waning antibody titers have been reported in humans who have recovered from MERS-CoV infection. full-length cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome has been developed for identifying future vaccine candidates. sporadic nature of human MERS-CoV infection makes controlled trials difficult. disease in camels usually appears mild, reducing the economic incentive for immunization. a serological study of 10,009 individuals in Saudi Arabia found 15 seropositive for MERS-CoV, 7 of whom were occupationally camel-exposed. most work has been done on symptomatic MERS patients because they are most likely to be detected and identified. the official overall CFR stands at 35.5% (World Health Organization 2018a). the main known exposures are health care-associated infections and contact with camels. Occupational exposure risks are also poorly characterized, both in health care and for those who work with camels. in the 2014 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, one study analyzed 191 symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV. 154 cases were hospital-associated (Lee and Wong 2015) 154 cases were hospital-associated (Lee and Wong 2015) RNA was found on environmental surfaces, including bedsheets and medical equipment, up to 5 days after a patient's last PCR-positive respiratory specimen. there were apparently few reports of infections in hospital laundry or maintenance workers, contrary to what would be expected for environmental transmission. the outbreak in south Korea also involved close contact among family members and other patients in hospital rooms. however, there is relatively little information on asymptomatic individuals, most of whom are detected by contact tracing. one model suggested an R0 of 3.5\u20136.7 in Jeddah and 2.0\u20132.8 in Riyadh. the risk of secondary transmission following an imported MERS-CoV case is 22.7% (95% CI: 19.2\u201325.1%), with the risks of generations 2, 3, and 4 estimated to be 10.5%, 6.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. two travelers returning to the Netherlands from a separate pilgrimage in may 2014 were found to have MERS-CoV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al. 2014) casual transmission (outside of family and health care settings) has not been observed. tics have suggested that the identical sequences may be due to cross-contamination. but the authors maintain that the isolates were collected on different days and processed in different facilities. the authors maintain that the isolates were collected on different days and processed in different facilities. seropositivity has been found consistently in africa and Middle Eastern camels since 1983 (Table 1). there is virologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection in camels in Qatar (Ferguson and Kerkhove 2014, Haagmans et al. 2014), Egypt (Chu et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2014), Oman (nowotny and Kolodziejek 2014), Saudi Arabia (Hemida et al. 2014 seroprevalence reported higher in camels imported from Sudan (543/594; 88.7%) and East Africa (71/98; 72.4%) than resident (257/339; 5.8%); total 41/1078 nasal swabs reported PCR positive, 35/41 from Sudan. increasing genomic evidence suggests a diversity of coronaviruses in camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. symptomatic MERS-CoV infection has been documented in both calves and adult camels. viral shedding was detected in nasal secretions up to 7 days postinoculation with MERS-CoV. milk has been suggested as a possible source of infection for both humans and camel foals. phylogenetic analysis utilizing 65 complete or partially complete MERS-CoV genomic sequences (32 from Saudi Arabian cases in 2013) it is possible that MERS-CoV itself may be a relatively new introduction in humans. the most recent common ancestor was in march 2012 (95% CI: December 2011\u2013June 2012) a large body of research has been amassed since the detection of MERS-CoV in 2012. the virus has rapidly been characterized, and its functional human receptor swiftly identified. observational research from outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea has generated a growing repository of clinical data. serology may not be reliable, due to cross-reactions and possibly waning antibodies. the diversity of coronaviruses, including MERS-like coronaviruses, in bat species across the globe indicates that continued surveillance of coronaviruses in bat species are justified. there is no compelling evidence of direct human-to-human transmission. there is no compelling evidence of direct human-to-human transmission. there is no compelling evidence of direct human-to-human transmission. the epidemiological literature on MERS-CoV is large, but much of it is fragmented and inconsistently reported. it is often difficult to deduce the sequence of infections, relationships between cases, or specific exposures. only publications in English or with English language abstracts were eligible for inclusion, although most cases have been in Arabic-speaking areas and Korea. however, hundreds of English language reports were available from countries around the world, minimizing this concern."}
