{"summary": "a biology teacher at the school, Stephen Hui, was an early mentor. he taught him about the molecule DNA and about the then-new science of recombinant DNA technology. his first year as a clinical student, he attended a lecture by John Bell. mastering PCR enabled Lo to detect rare target DNA sequences. he decided to pursue a doctorate at Oxford. he met his wife, Alice, who worked on her doctorate at Oxford. this was the first time that cell-free fetal DNA had been detected in maternal plasma (5). the following year, 1998, Lo and others (6) showed that cell-free fetal DNA is present in high concentrations in maternal plasma and serum. plasma has since become a preferred material for noninvasive prenatal testing. large-scale validation of massively parallel sequencing led to a diagnostic blood test for Down syndrome. the technique has since been performed on more than 300,000 pregnant women in more than 15 countries. in 2012, his team showed how cancer-associated genetic aberrations and variants could be detected in plasma taken from patients with cancer. method can detect these types of cancer with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88%."}
