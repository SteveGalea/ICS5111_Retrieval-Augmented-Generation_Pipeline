{"summary": "DEN/DHF is endemic in most dengue-endemic countries. lack of available, affordable, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests represents the primary hurdle. early diagnosis of dengue patients is critical to patient management. reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, nested PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and real-time PCR are used to diagnose dengue virus serotypes. the requirement to maintain reagents in cold and the need of expensive thermal cyclers (followed by gel electrophoresis) limits the utilization of these approaches. but the simplicity and high efficiency of LAMP to rapidly amplify DNA under isothermal conditions suggests that LAMP could be a potential alternative study obtained ethics approval from UMMC Medical Ethics Committee. a total of 189 serum samples from patients cl inically suspected with DENV infection were obtained from university of malaysia. RT-LAMP assay was performed using the Primer-Explorer V3 software. a 25 l reaction mixture consisted of 1.6 M FIP and BIP primer, 0.8 M Loop-F and Loop-B primer, 0.2 M F3 and B3 primer, 12.5 l of 2X reaction mixture (RM) (provided in the kit), 0.7 l of sterile deionize water, 1 l of FD (provided in the kit) and 1 real-time monitoring of amplification by the RT-LAMP assay was observed with Loopamp real-time turbidimeter (LA-320, Teramecs, Co., Ltd., Japan) the reaction is considered positive when the turbidity reached 0.1 within. the time needed for the turbidity of each tested sample to exceed 0.1 is referred to as the threshold time (Tt) [7]. RT-LAMP assay containing 120 M of HNB dye was performed in a 25 l reaction mixture with the same components as in the RT-LAMP assay except excluding the (FD) reagent. the standard curve for LAMP was constructed using 10-fold serial dilutions of plasmid DNA (106 copies to 1 copy) to sterile water. sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was assessed using a panel of serially diluted viral RNA (1000, 100, 10, and 1 copy numbers) the viral RNA used was quantitated using the genesig real-time qRT-PCR DENV Detection Kit. negative predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated based on an average of 84% of dengue prevalence in Malaysia [12]. a composite diagnosis for each sample (2 out of 3 tests based on qRT-PCR, ELISA and RT-LAMP giving the same result) was used as a reference. genomic viral RNA was extracted from 140 l of patient serum samples. RNA was eluted from the QIAspin columns in a final volume of 60 l of elution buffer. RT-LAMP assay was performed using the Primer-Explorer V3 software. to prevent cross-contamination, different sets of pipettes and different work areas were designated for template preparation, reaction mixture preparation and DNA amplification. experiments were performed in duplicate at least 2 times. real-time monitoring of amplification was observed with loopamp real-time turbidimeter (LA-320, Teramecs, Co., Ltd., Japan) the reaction is considered positive when the turbidity reached 0.1 within 60 min at 650 nm. the time needed for the turbidity of each tested sample to exceed at 0.1 is referred to as the threshold time (Tt) [7] the sequences were aligned using the 3\u2032-NCR gene sequences for DENV1-4 in GenBank to confirm that the target sequences were correct. the standard curve for LAMP was constructed using 10-fold serial dilutions of plasmid DNA (106 copies to 1 copy) to sterile water. the sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was assessed using a panel of serially diluted viral RNA (1000, 100, 10, and 1 copy numbers) extracted from culture supern clinical sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP assay was calculated based on screening of the 189 suspected dengue and 24 healthy donor serum samples. Sensitivity was calculated as (number of true positives)/(number of true positives + number of false negatives) specificity was calculated as (number of true negatives)/(number of true negatives + number of false positives) using loopamp real-time turbidimeter was found to be 30 min for DENV 1, 2 and 3 serotypes and 45 min for DENV 4 serotypes. the positive color (sky blue) and turbidity was only observed with the reference virus, whereas none of the control viruses showed a color change. clinical sensitivity of RT-LAMP, qRT-PCR and ELISA was 100%, 85.2%, and 100% respectively. RT-LAMP = Real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification; qRT-PCR = Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. -LAMP assay amplification carried out by naked-eye inspection following addition of HNB dye and real-time turbidimeter. positive reaction was shown by a color change from violet to sky blue. temperature of 65\u00b0C was optimal and time of positivity observed through naked-eye and real-time monitoring. 115 out of 189 samples were detected positive under RT-LAMP. ELISAs and qRT-PCR detected 162 and 98 positive samples respectively. clinical sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 100%, 85.2%, and 100% respectively. novel DNA amplification method developed by Notomi et al. (2000). within 1 h (at 65\u00b0C) effectively provided diagnostic results. RT-LAMP is easy to use, convenient, and cost-effective. therefore, it has been widely applied as a diagnostic tool for several viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases [13\u201315]. RT-LAMP assay designed in this study was shown to be 100% sensitive and specific. the date of illness onset ranged from day 1 to day 11 of illness. deNV viral loads detected on day 1 to day 9 ranged from 2.97 to 6.67 log10 DENV RNA copies/ml of serum."}
