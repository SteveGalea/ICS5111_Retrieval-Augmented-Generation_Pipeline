{"summary": "the accuracy of these tests depends on the cooperation of both patient and brain surgeon with only 85% accuracy. the current approach to measuring tau protein is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but it has several shortcomings. the accuracy of ELISA is affected by a set of problems intrinsic to the technique. GO is an energy acceptor with long-range energy transfer and biocompatibility. GO acted as a fluorescence quencher based on photo-induced electron transfer mechanism. biomolecules were attached on a GO surface through \u2013 stacking and hydrophobic interactions but had no specificity. figure 1a shows that tau-FITC is adsorbed strongly and is quenched when there is no tau analyte in the solution. the fluorescence signal of tau-FITC will be quenched when there is no analyte tau in solution. fewer tau-FITC are adsorbed and quenched. FITC-labelled tau441 (abbreviated as tau-FITC) was added at increasing concentrations to buffer solutions containing antibody-conjugated GO. tau-FITC-labelled tau441 (abbreviated as tau-FITC) was also added. sample solutions containing modified GO or bare GO were pipetted onto freshly cleaved mica and dried in ambient air. surface topographic features were scanned using a commercial AFM (CSPM 4000, Benyuan, China) a series of human tau concentrations (0\u2013600 ng ml1) was added to solutions containing 100 g ml1 antibody-conjugated GO. tau-FITC standard was added to each sample to reach a concentration of 100 ng ml1. when the reaction ended, the fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured. sample solutions containing modified GO were pipetted onto freshly cleaved mica and dried in ambient air. surface topographic features were scanned in contact mode using a commercial AFM (CSPM 4000, Benyuan, China) about 90% of the antibodies were immobilized on the GO surface. a series of human tau concentrations (0\u2013600 ng ml1) was added to solutions containing 100 g ml1 antibody-conjugated GO and reacted for 1 h either at 37\u00b0C or room temperature. the sample was held at 37\u00b0C to simulate the human body. surface morphologies of GO measured by AFM: bare GO, EDC\u2013NHS activated GO and antibody-conjugated GO. bare GO has a flakey appearance with a height of approximately 0.9 nm on mica. this corresponds to a monolayer of GO. the height of the antibody-conjugated GO increased dramatically (figure 2c) with a typical thickness of about 10 nm. bright spots are probably due to some degree of aggregation of antibodies on the edge of the GO. the change in GO's quenching efficiency was determined empirically. bare GO, antibody-conjugated GO and BSA-blocked GO were added to standard samples containing 100 ng ml1 of tau-FITC. this then exhibits a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 100 g ml1 of GO. fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing amounts of antibody-conjugated GO. the quenching efficiency reached about 60% at 400 g ml1. the thickness of the antibody-conjugated GO was much larger than bare GO. antibody-conjugated GO always had a concentration of 100 g ml1 tau-FITC. the addition of analyte tau-FITC will increase the fluorescence signal starting. the value of I was calculated by subtracting the final fluorescence intensity at 520 nm and the \u2018blank\u2019 sample without analyte tau. each sample contains 100 g ml1 rabbit anti-human tau antibody. we can generate a linear plot relating the tau-FITC fluorescence intensity with analyte tau concentrations from 0 to 20 ng ml1 (figure 4b) experiments under similar conditions were performed three times, and the data points in figure 4b were linear. we repeated the blank experiment 10 times to calculate the standard deviation (s.d.) of 10 background signals. a concentration of tau-FITC ranging 0\u2013100 pg ml1 means there are about 2 fmol ml1 FITC groups in the solution, which is too low to be detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer. this is the main aspect that limits the current LOD of our method. tau proteins bind to antibody-conjugated GO via specific binding. this means that the analyte tau will be adsorbed by antibody-conjugated GO preventing binding to and quenching the surface. to confirm specificity, we performed selectivity assays. antibody-conjugated graphene oxide The antibody was first activated by EDC. it formed a mediator with NHS and formed a peptide bond. bare GO, EDC\u2013NHS activated GO and antibody-conjugated GO exhibited a relative thickness of about 5 nm. surface morphologies of GO measured by AFM: (a) bare GO (approx. 0.9 nm), (b) EDC\u2013NHS activated GO (approx. 5 nm), (c) antibody-conjugated GO (approx. 10 nm) on freshly cleaved mica, (d) height profiles of the line scans (arrows) in (a), (b) and (c) are given in parentheses. the assay relies on the effectiveness of GO as an energy acceptor to provide efficient fluorescence quenching. the modification of the GO surface may change the molecular orbitals of GO and affect quenching efficiency. the change in GO's quenching efficiency was determined empirically. GO concentrations were 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 200 and 400 g ml1. the fluorescence intensity decreased with the increasing amounts of antibody-conjugated GO. the quenching efficiency reached about 60% at 400 g ml1. tau-FITC in solution would not be quenched by the presence of large concentrations of inactive GO. only the tau-FITC adsorbed on the surface of GO could be quenched. GO and 100 ng ml1 of tau-FITC, the fluorescence intensity is approximately 200 at 520 nm. the addition of analyte tau-FITC will increase the signal starting from this relatively large background signal. we can generate a linear plot relating the tau-FITC fluorescence intensity with analyte tau concentrations from 0 to 20 ng ml1 (figure 4b) the results indicate that the platform is feasible, and the analyte tau proteins could control the fluorescence quenching. the LOD of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method is better than our work (0.025 fmol ml1 [43] and 1.97 fmol ml1 [44]) this is because the signal of the tau protein was amplified by the SERS effect. this is because the signal of the tau protein was amplified by the SERS effect. immunoassay tau in PBS solution 6.4 ng ml1 (0.14 pmol ml1) our method 3.4. assay selectivity One major assumption is that tau proteins bind to antibody-conjugated GO via an antibody\u2013antigen type of specific binding. this means that the analyte tau will be adsorbed by antibody-conjugated GO preventing fluorescein labelled tau-FITC from binding to and quenching the surface tau' contained 200 ng ml1 of IgG, HSA and BSA as well as 10 ng ml1 of analyte tau. this signal was quantitatively controlled by the concentration of tau analyte. the increase in fluorescence signal correlate directly with increasing tau concentration. china (grant no. 21472139)"}
