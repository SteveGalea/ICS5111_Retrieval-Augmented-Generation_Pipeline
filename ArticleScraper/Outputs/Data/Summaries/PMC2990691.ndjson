{"summary": "japanese encephalitis (JE) is endemic to the entire south-east Asian and adjoining regions. no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. an effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication. the genus Flavivirus is composed of more than 70 closely related species. many flaviviruses are arthropod-borne and causes significant human diseases. the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), west Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are categorized as emerging global pathogens. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the JEV genome contain conserved sequence elements and can form conserved stem loop structure. the 3\u2032CSI is highly conserved across members of the JEV serocomplex, indicating the possibility that RNA elements within the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs are essential for its replication. oligomers are single stranded DNA analogues containing same nitrogenous bases as DNA. for efficient delivery into cells these Morpholino are often conjugated with arginine rich peptide. the transporter comprises a triazine core which serves to position eight guanidinium head groups. animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal ethical review board. the animal experiment protocol approval no. is NBRC/IAEC/2007/36. a 10% tissue suspension was made in MEM (minimum essential medium). piration and the monolayers were overlaid with MEM containing 4% FBS, 1% low-melting-point agarose and a cocktail of antibiotic\u2013antimycotic solution. the cell monolayer was stained with crystal violet after fixing the cells with 10% formaldehyde. oligos were designed to be complementary to sequences in the JEV (GP78 strain) genome. sequence(5\u2032-3\u2032) Targeted nucleotides in the JEV genome. regions blocked by the 3\u2032 MO and 5\u2032 MO are marked by black curved lines and marked with arrows. animals belonging to the Sham-treatment group received equal volumes of sterile 1 PBS only. survivality of animals in each group was monitored daily upto 15 days post JEV infection. cytokine bead array was used to quantitatively measure cytokine levels. the blots were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. after blocking with 7% skimmed milk, the blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against JEV E-glycoprotein (Abcam, USA), and JEV NS5 (a kind gift from Dr. Chun-Jung Chen, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan), iNOS (Upstate-Chemicon, USA), sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse anti-JEV antigen. slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. sections were cover slipped after mounting with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. oxidations of CM-H2DCFDA yield a fluorescent adduct dichlorofluorescein that is trapped inside the cell. the fluorescence intensity of intracellular CM-H2DCFDA is a linear indicator of the amount of H2O2 in the cells. the measured mean fluorescence intensity was then normalized to equal concentrations of protein in each sample. cells were washed twice with sterile 1 PBS to remove non-internalized virus. cells were fixed with BD cytofix solution (BD Biosciences) for 15 min. cells were then washed twice in wash buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) then resuspended in wash buffer at 1106 cells per 100 L. Virus and cells Vero cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. cells were seeded in six-well plates to form semi-confluent monolayer in about 18 h. Morpholino oligos were commercially procured from Gene Tools LLC, (Philomath, OR, USA) MOs targeted specific regions in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of the JEV genomic RNA. the SC-MO was additionally screened against all flaviviral sequences. the regions blocked by the 3\u2032 MO and 5\u2032 MO are marked by black curved lines and marked with arrows. animals were randomly distributed into 5 groups - Sham, JEV-infected, JEV-infected and treated with scrambled Morpholino. animals belonging to all groups except Sham received equal volume of filtered MEM. survivality of animals in each group was monitored daily up to 15 days post JEV infection. mice were evaluated by weight loss and abnormal behavioral & clinical observations in a masked manner to minimize bias [14], [20]. cytokine bead array (CBA) kits were used to quantitatively measure cytokine levels in mouse whole-brain lysates. 50 L of bead mix containing a population of beads with distinct fluorescence intensities. blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin to determine equivalent loading of samples. sections were cover slipped after mounting with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the slides were observed under Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and Zeiss Apotome microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) the fluorescence intensity of intracellular CM-H2DCFDA is a linear indicator of the amount of H2O2 in the cells. the measured mean fluorescence intensity was then normalized to equal concentrations of protein in each sample. cells were washed twice in wash buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) then resuspended in wash buffer at 1106 cells per 100 L. cells were resuspended in 400 L FACS buffer and analyzed on a FACS Calibur. the symptoms associated with JE in murine model were observed on daily basis. it was observed that 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO treated animals scored lesser than those belonging to the JEV-infected or JEV+SC-MO groups. survival of mice following JEV infection was dramatically increased with treatments of both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO. 3\u2032 MO and 5\u2032 MO treatment when compared to only JEV-infected or JEV+SC-MO group. significant reduction in viral titer was observed following MO treatment in animals. expression of NS5 and E glycoprotein was significantly increased in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO than Sham. EV+SC-MO groups were drastically reduced following 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO treatments (p0.01). thionin staining of brain sections from all the treatment groups showed damaged neurons with altered morphology. compared to sections belonging to only JEV-infected or JEV+SC-MO groups. levels of MCP-1, IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6 were significantly increased in both JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups. the elevated levels of these proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced with 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO treatments (p0.01). two fold increases were observed in the ROS levels in the brain samples of all treatment groups. significant reduction in the ROS levels was observed in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups when compared to Sham (p0.01) increases were observed in the ROS levels in the brain samples of JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups in comparison to Sham. iNOS expression was found to increase 8-fold in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham. iNOS levels showed significant decreases in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups when compared to only JEV-infected groups. p0.01 for JEV+ 3\u2032MO when compared to Sham; $ p0.01 for JEV+ 5\u2032 MO when compared to Sham. both phospho ERK1 and ERK2 levels were found to be significantly increased in JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham (p0.01) the levels of phospho ERK1 and ERK2 showed considerable decreases in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups when compared to only JEV-infected groups. viral loads were found to significantly reduced in both JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups when compared to only JEV-infected cells (p0.01) only 16% and 9% of the total gated cells were found to be positive for JEV antigen in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups respectively. survival of mice following JEV infection dramatically increased with treatments of both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO. mice are protected from JEV following treatment of both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO. survival was dramatically increased with treatments of both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO. however, the survival in 3\u2032 MO treated mice was greater (90%) than those treated with 5\u2032MO (75%) immunoblot analysis showed expression of JEV NS5 and E glycoprotein were significantly increased in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO than Sham. expression of NS5 was significantly increased in JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham (p0.01). MOs abrogates neurodegeneration, microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. thionin staining of brain sections from all the treatment groups showed damaged neurons with altered morphology. compared to sections belonging to only JEV-infected or JEV+SC-MO groups. microglial activation and increased proinflammatory cytokine production are hallmarks of JEV infection [24]. in brain sections of JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups the number of activated microglia with characteristic morphology appeared to be more frequent when compared to sections belonging to Sham, JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups. superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) and Thioredoxin (TRX-1) are the proteins associated with oxidative stress. SOD-1 levels were found to be elevated approximately 2- and 3-fold in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups respectively. drastic increases were observed in the levels of HSP-70 in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups, the levels remained significantly higher than Sham (B&C). iNOS expression was found to increase 8-fold in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to those obtained from Sham. iNOS levels showed significant decreases in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups. phospho ERK1 and ERK2 levels were found to be significantly increased in JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham (p0.01). levels of pNFB and phosphoP38MAPK were significantly reduced in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups respectively, when compared to only JEV-infected groups (A\u2013C) phospho ERK1 and ERK2 levels were found to be increased by approximately 3- and 5-fold in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups respectively. only 16% and 9% of the total gated cells were positive for JEV antigen in JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups respectively. compared to 30% in JEV+SC-MO group, and 34% in JEV+SC-MO group. use of anti-sense molecules for targeted inhibition of viral replication has been under investigation. arginine-based peptides are not commercially available for research purposes. their greatest efficacies have been in delivering Morpholinos to a wide spectrum of tissues. degradation of the peptide portion of the conjugates was found to be time and tissue dependent. maximum suggested dose in mammals is 12.5 mg/kg in a 24 hour period. we had chosen two doses of 5 mg and 10 mg per kg body weight (b.w.) of the animals. there was no significant difference between the survival rate of JEV-infected and MO treated mice in either dose. sion and entry into host cells, hemagglutination, cellular tropism, viral virulence, and protective immune responses are inhibited due to the MOs. the number of replication-competent infective viral particles in the brain was significantly reduced, which leads to neuroprotection. the levels of stress related proteins such as SOD-1, HSP-70 and TRX were found to be positively modulated following 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 MO treatment. pNFB regulates apoptotic genes, especially the TRAF1 and TRAF2, and checks the activities of the caspases. the decrease in phophoP38 MAPK levels correlates with decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokine levels in obtained from the brain. the MOs are specifically developed for in vivo studies, but are also known to be taken up by cells in culture conditions. lysates from all the treatment groups were subjected to plaque assay. PFU/mL was significantly higher in both JEV+3\u2032 MO and JEV+5\u2032 MO groups."}
