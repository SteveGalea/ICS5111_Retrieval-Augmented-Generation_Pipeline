{"summary": "many works have been done to predict [1], [2] or even contain [3]\u2013[6] the spread of severe epidemics. effective control of infectious disease outbreaks continues to elude us. a recent advancement in the field is the application of network theory. a more effective intervention strategy would employ understanding the \u2018shape\u2019 of the infection network and applying that knowledge to effectively tear the network apart. this can be done by targeting nodes that play important roles in the network (i.e. the \u2018hubs\u2019), and the \u2018backbones\u2019 connecting one hub to another. to test the proposed strategy in principle, we first generate artificial social networks of different sizes but with roughly the same clustering characteristics. newman et al. and Jin et al. proposed friendship-formation dynamics models to generate social-like networks from scratch [27], [28] for proof-of-concept study, we generate social-like networks to act as our infection networks from scratch. the clustering coefficient c of the network stops increasing and fluctuates about a time-independent long-run average. in generating the infection networks, we set L = 50 as the maximum number of friends a node can have. for simplicity, we choose r = nr+nm = 500 such that the total number of links (hence the average degree k> of the initial random network remains more or less constant. for a given time step size t, a more infectious disease will have a larger q. the simulation time step t itself is chosen, for simplicity, to be roughly equal to the typical incubation and recovery period of the disease. this implies that tRt, i.e. the infected nodes recover after one simulation time step. in countries where consultation fees are high, we expect the latter to be dominant. voluntary reporting rates are compensated by the large volume of daily incidences generated by such diseases. for our study, we vary C from 50% to 85%. the epidemic starts on node 9 at t = 0. Thereafter, nodes 5 and 12 are infected at t = 1 by node 9. at t = 3, node 3 is infected by node 4 (which recovers), while node 8 is infected by node 6 (which recovers) nodes 10, 11, and 13 recover without infecting any other nodes. finally, at t = 4, nodes 3 and 8 recover and the epidemic ends. we expect the algorithm to produce mostly wrong links at first. but as the weights are decaying with time, most of the wrongly-estimated links will disappear at the end. correctly-estimated links tend to get constantly reinforced over multiple epidemics. 2.1 Artificial Infection Network Generation Many naturally-occurring networks are scale-free. others argued that social networks are different as they show strong clustering of nodes (also called community structures) and their degree distributions are not power laws [24] each time step, we randomly break r existing links to simulate friendship decay. we then calculate the clustering coefficient c of the network using the method by Schank and Wagner [29]. the network has converged and stop the simulation. the probability q of infecting susceptible neighbours reflects the characteristic infection rate of the particular disease. for a given time step size t, a more infectious disease will have a larger q. the simulation time step t itself is chosen, for simplicity, to be roughly equal to the typical incubation and recovery period of the disease (about 3\u20135 days for common cold) 2.3 Censorship and Network Estimation When collecting incidence data, we expect low incidence reporting rates because: (1) some infected individuals do not show symptoms (sub-clinical cases); (2) some others choose not to consult doctors despite showing symptoms (unreported cases) voluntary reporting rates in Singapore are relatively high because of the low consultation fees. the infection of nodes 4, 11, 13 precedes the infection of node 8. at t = 2, nodes 5 and 12 are infected at t = 1 by node 9, which recovers and become immune to subsequent infection. at t = 3, node 3 is infected by node 4 (which recovers), while node 8 is infected by node 6 (which recovers) if an existing estimated link is reactivated, it is reinforced by adding w = 1.00 to its weight. if an existing estimated link is reactivated, it is reinforced by adding w = 1.00 to its weight. correctly-estimated links tend to get constantly reinforced over multiple epidemics. the estimated network is superimposed onto the original network. the algorithm estimated 738 links correctly and made only 196 wrong estimates. the reconstruction is highly accurate in this test case. nodes, 1,584 links, and average degree k> = 3. 60% of total links are estimated with 79% accuracy. we then immunized the same 67 nodes on the actual infection network. the method reduced the average size of the epidemics by 58%\u201388%. log-log plots of estimation accuracy as a function of the number of estimated links n. the censor rates used are (a) 50%, (b) 60%, (c) 70%, and (d) 80%. the decay exponents (slope in log-log plot above) are found to be between 0.24 and 0.32. we plot the estimation accuracy versus: (a) censor rate C, (b) number of SIR epidemics S, (c) network size N, and (d) censor rate for different value of average degrees k>. we extrapolate from the linear fits to obtain and compare accuracies of n = 100, 1,000, and 10,000 estimated links in figures above. we performed estimation on networks with three different sizes N = 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 using data from 100 epidemics. we also compared the estimation accuracies for networks with N = 10,000 nodes and two different average degrees k> = 10 and 20. 864 nodes identified through EGP on the estimated network were isolated from the actual network before the start of epidemics. the average infection rate after EGP-based mitigation is decreased to 6,345 nodes. the same EGP-based intervention as in (a), except done at different times after the epidemics have started. in 40 simulations, the \u2018epidemics\u2019 infected only 2\u20135 nodes and died off very quickly after 1 or 2 time steps after starting. for the other 60 simulations, we observe very slowly circulating epidemics that lasted more than 60 time steps. the number of incidences reached a peak of 116 cases 28 time steps after the start. censored 70% of the incidence data before estimating the infection network. the algorithm estimated 738 links correctly and made only 196 wrong estimates, resulting in 79% estimation accuracy. the estimation is based on 100 SIR epidemics and 70% censor rate. we varied the number of estimated links n, the censor rate C, the size of the network N, the number of SIR epidemics S used for estimation, and the average degree of the network k>. the same clustering coefficient of c = 0.05 is maintained across the networks to ensure meaningful comparisons. decay exponents are found to be between 0.24 and 0.32, thus implying that the accuracy actually falls off very slowly with the number of estimated links n. the actual infection network has N = 10,000, k> = 10, and c = 0.05. censorship and history dependence of the epidemic will not provide a good picture of the network. for different seeds, the epidemic progresses along different transmission routes. therefore, even if we could track all incidences for a given epidemic, this snapshot is even more incomplete. the accuracy falls off very slowly as a power law in the number of estimated links n, with power-law exponents much smaller than 1. censor rates used are (a) 50%, (b) 60%, (c) 70%, and (d) 80%. the decay exponents are found to be between 0.24 and 0.32. all estimations are based on 100 SIR epidemics. the actual infection network has N = 10,000, k> = 10, and c = 0.05. in Figure 4b, we show the estimation accuracy as a function of the number of different SIR epidemics S used in the estimation with 50% censor rate. we found the accuracy to improve with S initially before saturating to 100% as more incidence data becomes available. the estimated network has a total of 2,561 nodes and 6,467 estimated links. 1,074 of these estimated links are correct (16.6% accuracy) the estimated network has a total of 2,561 nodes and 6,467 estimated links. systematic isolation of only 8.6% of the population reduced the peak infection rate by about 40% and delayed the peak infection time by about 20%. however, even though random isolation also reduced and delayed the peak, the targeted intervention is still significantly better. the 864 separator nodes identified by EGP are clearly special on the estimated network. we tried EGP mitigation on the larger networks despite the poor estimation accuracy. the estimated network has a total of 2,561 nodes and 6,467 estimated links. the estimated network has a total of 2,561 nodes and 6,467 estimated links. the estimated network represents only a small fraction (0.13) of the actual number of links, and only 16.6% of the estimated links are correct. systematic isolation of only 8.6% of the total population reduced the peak infection rate by about 40%. even though random isolation also reduced and delayed the peak infection time by about 20%, the targeted intervention is still significantly better. strategy is still very effective even when it is applied as late as 10 time steps (roughly 30 days) after the start, just 2 time steps away before the peak. the peak infection rate is reduced by about 20% and total number of cases by 12%, as compared to the unmitigated case. the infection network averaged over multiple epidemiological and social seasons. with enough data, it might also be possible to estimate these seasonal infection networks. however, we believe that even with the estimated network, interventions and mitigations will still be effective enough to justify its study and estimation. 4.2 Equal Graph Partitioning Effective epidemic control measure is important for mankind as the problems associated with severe infectious disease can only increase in severity along with global population growth. we will discuss how the proposed mitigation method addresses these two problems. lack of medical attention and insufficient resources might delay recovery process and result to a higher number of casualties than need be. infected people are observed even when applied late into the epidemic. but the result suggests early implementation is critical in slowing down the epidemic. this strategy may find a more receptive audience in a country like the us. removing all nodes on the estimated network stretches two-month epidemics to over half a year. about 1/4 of the population needs to be isolated, compared to only about 9% of the population for EGP intervention. estimated infection networks are not always accurate, especially when the proportion of unreported incidences is high. the estimation accuracy goes to zero at censor rate CT100%. this implies that it might be difficult to do network estimation in the us. the infection network averaged over multiple epidemiological and social seasons. if the estimation is based solely on flu, it would take 100 years to obtain the estimated network. in subtropical countries, there is typically one flu season each year. 4.2 Equal Graph Partitioning Effective epidemic control measure is important for mankind as the problems

country like the u.s.. we must be wary that this procedure should not be used as a mean of discrimination. we must be wary that this procedure should not be used as a mean of discrimination. removing all nodes on the estimated network stretches two-month epidemics to over half a year. about 1/4 of the population needs to be isolated, compared to only about 9% of the population for intervention. a separate systematic study will be necessary to understand how effective and efficient this more aggressive intervention strategy can be. an SIR epidemic spreads through an artificial social network with N = 1,000 nodes, 1,584 links, average degree k> = 3.168 and clustering coefficient C = 0.3928. the transmission probability used for this SIR epidemic is p = 0.80, and infected nodes recover after tR = 1 time step. in this video, another SIR epidemic starts from a different seed on the artificial social network. IR epidemics from the 1,000-node, 1,584-link network using the algorithm described in the text. 738 of the 934 estimated links, 738 are correct, giving an accuracy of 79.01%. the EGP procedure then identifies 67 separator nodes, and when these are removed, the immunized network has 1,359 links remaining. the original network consists of 1,000 nodes and 1,584 links. the estimated network EGP is based on consists of 475 nodes and 934 links."}
