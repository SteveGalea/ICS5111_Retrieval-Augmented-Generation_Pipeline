{"summary": "EBOV, which belongs to the Zaire ebolavirus species, shows the highest pathogenicity in humans. the EBOV Makona variant caused the recent unprecedented outbreak in west africa (1). RESTV has not yet been associated with human disease. primary human monocyte-derived macrophages are activated upon EBOV infection in vitro. induction and secretion of cytokines was observed at early time points postinfection in MDMs infected with live or inactivated virus or with virus-like particles (VLPs) it has been reported that this activation is triggered by the interaction of the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (6, 27\u201333) RESULTS RESTV infection is not associated with strong changes in gene expression. human MDMs were infected with purified, endotoxin-free EBOV or RESTV particles at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 to 7. samples were prepared at different time points starting at 6 h up to 4 days postinfection (dpi) RNA levels were similar at 1 dpi (Fig. 1A, C, and D) infected MDMs grown in chamber slides were infected with EBOV or RESTV or left uninfected (Mock) cells were stained with DAPI (blue) RNA-Seq analysis was performed with samples generated from three different donors in independent experiments. genes identified in RESTV-infected MDMs overlapped with those identified in EBOV-infected cells. about one-third of the genes identified in RESTV infection were also identified as DE in EBOV infection. RESTV infection was not correlated with strong inhibition of these pathways. functional enrichment analysis was performed on global transcriptomic data. IPA is based on a manually curated knowledge base that links gene expression to biological functions. many of these pathways contain genes known to be involved in potent inflammatory responses. the heat map represents the average expression intensities for each condition and time point relative to the average of time-matched mock-infected samples. bar graphs represent canonical pathways associated with genes identified in each of the modules. ation pathway 6.61E + 00 GM-CSF signaling 6.50E + 00 Role of macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis 6.26E + 00 Module 3 (938 transcripts, orange) EIF2 signaling 7.42E + 00 Cell cycle control of chromosomal replication 7.24E + 00 Breast cancer regulation by stathmin 1 7.08E + 00 Cell cycle: G2/ EBOV and LPS, but not RESTV, activate similar immune pathways. pathway enrichment is reported as log10 P value, where values greater than 1.3 are considered significant. RESTV infection is not associated with an IFN signature. infection with EBOV, but not RESTV, induces a type I and type III IFN response in MDMs. cellular RNA was isolated at the indicated time points. the heat map represents the average expression intensities for type I and type III IFN genes. neither IFN- nor CXCL10 secretion was detected in RESTV-infected MDMs up to 4 dpi. the lack of expression of these genes in RESTV-infected cells up to 4 dpi was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. expression of type I IFNs, CXCL10, and CCL5 requires activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF3. 3 was detected in a significant number of EBOV-infected cells as early as 30 min postinfection. early events that trigger the activation of IRF3 and subsequent induction of IFN genes in EBOV-infected MDMs are absent in RESTV infection. robust expression of proinflammatory mediators was observed in EBOV-infected MDMs, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), CXCL8 (IL-8), and CCL4 (MIP1) in contrast, RESTV-infected MDMs remained remarkably silent. chemokine CXCL8 was secreted from both EBOV- and RESTV-infected MDMs. RESTV infection remains to be determined. FIG 6. Differences in NF-B activation in EBOV- and RESTV-infected MDMs. as controls, cells were stimulated with LPS or left untreated. cellular mRNA was isolated at the indicated time points and used for RNA-Seq analysis. a few cells showed nuclear p65 staining in RESTV-infected cells. this supports the RNA-Seq and Luminex results. RESTV infection does not elicit a robust proinflammatory response. DNA binding of NF-B subunit p65 was detected in EBOV-infected cells at 1 hpi. a similar pattern was observed for p50, although less pronounced. EBOV infection of MDMs leads to early activation of canonical NF-B signaling. light gray bars, mock infected; dark gray bars, LPS treated; black bars, EBOV infected; white bars, RESTV infected. statistically significant differences from Mock 30 min as determined by one-way ANOVA are indicated. MDMs were infected with RESTV or EBOV and at 1 dpi treated with LPS. LPS stimulation after RESTV infection led to significant changes in gene expression compared to RESTV-infected, untreated cells. gene expression profile was similar to response to LPS alone. EBOV or RESTV infection + LPS stimulation compared to noninfected cells only; right, EBOV or RESTV infection + LPS stimulation compared to infected cells only. each column represents an experimental condition, and each row represents individual genes. module Ingenuity canonical pathway log (P value) 1,765 transcripts, red Death receptor signaling 1.58E + 01 Type I diabetes mellitus signaling 1.08E + 01 Induction of apoptosis by HIV1 1.07E + 01 TWEAK signaling 1.03E + 01 Toll-like receptor signaling 1.01E + 01 Role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses 1.00E + 01 TNFR1 signaling 9.95E + 00 only a minor fraction of EBOV- and RESTV-infected cells showed nuclear accumulation of p65 at 1 dpi. RESTV GP does not activate TLR4-mediated responses. we first tested gamma-irradiated EBOV and RESTV particles for their ability to induce p65 translocation in MDMs in the absence of viral replication. p65 was translocated into the nuclei of MDMs stimulated with gamma-irradiated EBOV particles but not in cells treated with inactivated RESTV particles. MDMs were treated for 3 h with LPS-RS or left untreated before stimulation with LPS or VLPs for 1 h. the percentage of cells showing nuclear p65 localization was determined by counting at least 100 cells from three different donors. VLPs were produced in 293T cells transfected with a mixture of expression plasmids encoding EBOV or RESTV NP, matrix protein VP40, and GP. to produce GP-free VLPs, the GP expression plasmids were omitted. the presence of EBOV and RESTV GP in VLP preparations was confirmed by Western blotting. NF-B in MDMs is, indeed, mediated by TLR4 signaling. RESTV infection is not associated with strong changes in gene expression. to compare host response to infection with highly pathogenic and presumably nonpathogenic ebolaviruses, human MDMs were infected with purified, endotoxin-free EBOV or RESTV particles. amount of VP35 mRNA was lower in RESTV-infected MDMs than in EBOV-infected cells at 6 h postinfection (hpi), the observed difference was not statistically significant. EBOV and RESTV VP35 mRNA levels were similar at 1 dpi. RNA-Seq data set was used to compare host gene expression profiles across samples. differences in expression of hundreds of genes in EBOV-infected MDMs at 1 and 2 dpi. only a few cellular genes were differentially expressed in RESTV-infected MDMs. led receptor (GPCR) signaling, and cell cycle control were observed in both EBOV infection and LPS treatment. RESTV infection was not correlated with strong inhibition of these pathways. functional enrichment analysis was performed on global transcriptomic data using ingenuity pathway analysis. a Venn diagram shows the overlap of DE genes at 6 hpi and 1 and 2 dpi. each module is identified by a unique color, represented on the left of the heat map. bar graphs represent canonical pathways associated with genes identified in each of the modules. presentation pathway 1.14E + 01 Type I diabetes mellitus signaling 7.85E + 00 Cross talk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells 7.58E + 00 Dendritic cell maturation 7.51E + 00 TREM1 signaling 7.45E + 00 GM-CSF signaling 6.50E + 00 Role of macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis 6.26E + 00 EBOV and LPS, but not RESTV, activate similar immune pathways in MDMs. pathway enrichment is reported as log10 P value. RESTV infection is not associated with an IFN signature. we were not able to detect type I or type III IFN gene expression at any time point investigated for LPS-treated samples. RESTV infection led to minimal changes in expression levels of IFN genes and ISGs. no IFN- or CXCL10 secretion was detected in RESTV-infected cells up to 4 dpi. the lack of expression of these genes in RESTV-infected cells up to 4 dpi was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. RESTV infection of MDMs does not lead to a delayed host cell response at late stages of infection. RESTV infection does not induce nuclear IRF3 translocation. early events that trigger the activation of IRF3 and subsequent induction of IFN genes in EBOV-infected MDMs are absent in RESTV infection. we observed profound upregulation of genes involved in NF-B signaling in EBOV-infected and LPS-treated MDMs. this group of genes was only moderately affected by RESTV infection. RESTV-infected MDMs remained remarkably silent. chemokine CXCL8 was secreted from both EBOV- and RESTV-infected MDMs. the biological relevance of CXCL8 secretion in RESTV infection remains to be determined. an early event of canonical NF-B activation is the nuclear translocation of the NF-B subunit p65, which we examined by coimmunofluorescence analysis of infected or LPS-treated cells. RESTV infection does not elicit a robust proinflammatory response in human MDMs. the reappearance of IB at later time points suggests that NF-B is not constitutively activated in EBOV-infected MDMs. we then performed DNA binding assays to examine if the various NF-B subunits were able to bind to their DNA target sequences in EBOV-infected cells. clei were stained with DAPI (blue). a representative image of mock-infected cells for one time point and one antibody combination is shown. the experiment was performed four times with cells from four different donors. lack of inflammatory response in RESTV-infected MDMs could be due to lack of activating stimuli or to the inhibitory function of viral proteins that block antiviral signaling pathways. RESTV or EBOV-infected MDMs were infected with RESTV or EBOV and at 1 dpi treated with LPS. cellular mRNA was isolated and subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. heat map represents the average expression intensities of the union of 4311 DE genes for each of the specified treatment conditions. each column represents an experimental condition, and each row represents individual genes. no statistically significant differences were observed between LPS-treated cells and cells infected with EBOV or RESTV prior to LPS treatment. the experiment was performed three times using MDMs from 3 individual donors. each donor is represented by a different symbol. natural killer cells 1.01E + 01 Activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors 9.60E + 00 Pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis 9.55E + 00 Mismatch repair in eukaryotes 7.79E + 00 2261 transcripts, blue Role of CHK proteins in cell cycle checkpoint control 6.86E + 00 Cell cycle control of chromosomal replication 5.61E + 00 ATM signaling 4.62E + 00 Mitotic roles of Polo chemokine induction in RESTV-infected MDMs cannot be attributed to inhibition of immune-modulatory signaling pathways. RESTV GP does not activate these pathways in human MDMs. previous studies showed that the EBOV surface protein GP is sufficient to induce a proinflammatory response via TLR4 activation (30, 32, 33) Western blot analysis of eVLPs and rVLPs using antibodies against EBOV GP1, RESTV GP1 and EBOV VP40. protein bands were visualized using the Li-Cor Odyssey system. VLPs were produced in 293T cells transfected with a mixture of expression plasmids encoding EBOV or RESTV NP, matrix protein VP40, and GP. to produce GP-free VLPs, the GP expression plasmids were omitted. the presence of EBOV and RESTV GP in VLP preparations was confirmed by Western blotting. LPS-RS pretreatment abolished nuclear p65 translocation mediated by VLPs containing EBOV GP. the EBOV GP-triggered activation of NF-B in MDMs is, indeed, mediated by TLR4 signaling and can be blocked by TLR4 antagonists. all infections in the present study were performed with sucrose cushion-purified, endotoxin-free virus stocks for both EBOV and RESTV. RESTV-infected MDMs showed a cytokine and IFN response similar to but weaker than seen in cells infected with EBOV at a high MOI. this could be attributed either to differences in the transcription and replication kinetics, as reported previously. s of various viruses have been shown to induce a TLR4-mediated inflammatory response (30, 32, 33, 46\u201350) recognition of bacterial LPS is a complex process and requires the interaction of four proteins, including CD14 and MD-2 (51) both have been shown to be required for TLR4 activation mediated by the fusion protein F of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) EBOV-triggered proinflammatory response was also antagonized by LPS-RS. a recent study showed that controlling the excessive inflammatory response induced by EBOV infection could be a viable strategy to treat EBOV disease. proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-, were secreted at much higher levels in LPS-treated MDMs. this suggests that myD88-dependent pathways are preferentially activated in LPS-treated cells. TRIF/TRAM-mediated signaling is activated to a lesser extent. studies on the ebolavirus IFN antagonists VP35 and VP24 provide evidence that RESTV VP35 and VP24 might be less efficient in counteracting the IFN response. a dysregulated induction of a TLR4-mediated proinflammatory response can lead to severe tissue and organ damage, which is a hallmark of EBOV infection.
