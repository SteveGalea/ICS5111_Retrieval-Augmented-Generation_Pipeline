{"summary": "leptospira colonizes the kidneys of reservoir (e.g. rats) and accidental hosts such as humans. urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. we hypothesize that leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes. urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function. leptospirosis is among the world\u2019s most important zoonotic infectious diseases [1,2], characterized by variable manifestations ranging from acute febrile illness to severe disease with a combination of fever, acute kidney injury, jaundice, severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, refractory shock, and aseptic meningitis. urine exosome analysis holds key information that is relevant to differences between clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic leptospirosis infection. urine exosome analysis of urines from rats infected with leptospira has been shown to be modified under pathological or stress conditions. three-week old Sprague Dawley rats were housed in cages of 1\u20132 rats each. uninfected controls were inoculated ip with sterile EMJH. infection was confirmed by serology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. infected and uninfected rats were prepared using an in-house protocol developed based on the solvent exclusion principle. we conducted 1 dimensional SDS-PAGE of the exosome proteins prior to in-gel trypsinization. each rat urine sample (only terminal sample) was separately analyzed. the supernatant was removed, replaced with fresh 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. the supernatant was removed and saved. a total of 50 L of 50% ACN-0.2% formic acid was added to the sample. mass spectra were acquired using a nanospray ionization source. each full scan was recorded in positive ion mode over a 400\u20131600 m/z range. the maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans were 50 and 200 ms. the experimental MS/MS spectra were correlated to tryptic peptide sequences by comparison with the theoretical mass spectra obtained by in silico digestion of the Rattus norvegicus protein database. the following criteria were used for the identification of peptide sequences and related proteins: trypsin as enzyme. the relative contribution of each protein from a given animal from a group was expressed as percentage of the total. the NSAF number included the peptide number as well as the total length of the protein. the peptide counts data were log-transformed prior to analysis by multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis. protein candidates with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% were qualified for subsequent validation by Western immunoblotting. Western immunoblotting and quantification antibody against alanyl aminopeptidase was purchased from Proteintech Group, Inc.. six animals (3 males and 3 females) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 108 mid-log phase L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain HAI1026. uninfected controls were inoculated ip with sterile EMJH. peptides in the exosome from confounding post in-gel trypsinization proteins were extracted twice by the addition of 50 l of 0.2% for. each rat urine sample was run in a separate gel lane. gel slices for each lane were cut to 1 mm x 1 mm cubes. the supernatant was removed and combined with the supernatant from the first extraction. a total of 50 L of 50% ACN-0.2% formic acid was added to the sample, which was vortexed again at room temperature for 30 min. mass spectra were acquired using a QExactive mass spectrometer. nanospray was achieved using a coated fused silica emitter. each full scan was recorded in positive ion mode over a 400\u20131600 m/z range. peptide sequences and related proteins were identified. trypsin as enzyme; three missed cleavages per peptide allowed. mass tolerances of 50 ppm for precursor ions and 0.8 Da for fragment ions. peptide counts data were log-transformed prior to analysis by multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and univariate 1-way ANOVA with unpaired comparisons. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the VIP score is a weighted sum of squares of the PLS loadings. the amount of explained Y-variance in each dimension influenced the weights. protein candidates with a false discovery rate were qualified for subsequent validation by Western immunoblotting. 180 proteins and 272 proteins were unique to the urines of female and male rats infected with L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni respectively. differences in the composition and quantity of proteins from infected and uninfected rats potentially indicates the reactions induced in these animals by leptospiral infection. 204 exosome proteins were identified classifiable into 7 different groups. the exosome protein constitution also showed increase in the number of proteins expressed in the exosome, viz 32 proteins uniquely present in the uninfected exosome versus 57 unique proteins in the infected rat exosome. 57 proteins were present among all the infected rats. only 3 were shared between infected males and females. 37 were unique to infected males and 17 were unique to infected females. high value of VIP score indicates great contribution of the proteins to the group separation. a VIP score of 1.5 is considered to enable discrimination between 2 phenotypes. a low n (= 3) per group that is employed in this study is higher than 3. clade A, member 3K VIP13 6978769

Leptospira-infected versus uninfected control. p0.05 rat urine exosome CD13 Leptospira-infected versus uninfected control. this is the first report on urinary exosome protein analysis in an animal model of leptospiral renal colonization. the overwhelming increase in protein expression quality indicates a specific consequence of leptospiral infection of the organ of leptospiral transmission. however, the biological significance of these findings remains to be determined further. urine exosome CD13 upregulation due to leptospiral infection is robust and consistent in both male and female rats. previous work has demonstrated expression of CD13/APN on intestinal and kidney epithelial cell brush border [25,49\u201352] this multifunctional property notwithstanding, so far, CD13/APN activity or its upregulation has not been described specifically in the context of leptospirosis infection. this multifunctional property notwithstanding, so far, a role for the upregulation of APN expression and activity in the membrane is conceivable. osomes in the renal tubular epithelial cell and their release into urine have been well established in animal models showing leptospiral antigen expression in parallel to kidney changes. if leptospiral infection directly causes increased APN packaging into exosome, its subsequent release needs to be addressed. we tested the hypothesis that the expression of the most abundant protein in the normal healthy urine, Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) should be affected in leptospira infected rats. we found that the expression of the most abundant protein in the normal healthy urine should be affected in leptospira infected rats. exosomal analysis can be applied to study any other model including acute phases of leptospiral infection in humans or to test the hypothesis that acute infection results in differences in the urine exosome that can be tracked and understood. the difference in protein numbers between infected and uninfected rat urine exosome is remarkably large that it imparts the highest VIP score to CD13. urine exosome analysis is non-invasive, highly specific and provides a window into the organ level. the host response to leptospirosis infection is gender-specific, and involves renal tubular elements. this methodology of studying differences between male and female host response to infection can be applied in the setting of human disease. the individual-specific pathways mediating different magnitude responses to the same infection can be accurately measured using exosome markers. this assumes importance especially in the setting of sub-clinical leptospirosis infection where in the patient does not display any clinical features/symptoms but continues to play host to the bacterium. this methodology of studying differences between male and female host response to infection can be applied in the setting of human disease. the individual-specific pathways mediating different magnitude responses to the
