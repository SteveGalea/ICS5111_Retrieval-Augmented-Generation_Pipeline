{"summary": "a subset of RSV-infected mice were inoculated with live RSV, heat-inactivated RSV or medium. RNA loads were measured by PCR in peripheral blood from day 1 to 14 post-inoculation, peaked on day 5 and significantly correlated with nasal and lung RSV loads. RNA respiratory viruses, such as the SARS-coronavirus, rhinoviruses, seasonal influenza or avian influenza (H5N1) viruses have been associated with detection of viral RNA in whole blood, blood fractions, serum or plasma in a subset of patients with acute or fatal disease. experimental design and sample collection Four to six mice per time point, per group were evaluated on days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 and 21. mice were treated with an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody (moAb; motavizumab) administered intraperitoneally (IP; 2.50 mg/per mouse or 100 mg/kg in 100 l) at 72 h post-inoculation. results represent aggregate data from four independent experiments. each included 4-6 mice per time-point per group. samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and whole-mount sections stained with H&E. RNA was obtained from nasal wash, whole-lung specimens and extracted using ion-exchange mini-columns. RNA reverse transcription, amplification and quantification of a conserved region of the N gene was performed as described [20-22] human RSV A2 (ATCC-1540) was grown on Hep-2 cells. a two-tailed p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. systemic CCL2, CXCL1 (innate immunity cytokines), IFN- (Th-1) and IL-4 (Th-2) mRNA expression was measured sequentially from days 1 to 7 post-inoculation. blood samples (500 L/mouse) were obtained by cardiac puncture, mixed in RNA stabilization reagent (Tempus\u00ae solution; ABI, Foster City, CA) immunohistochemical Staining (IHC) whole lung samples and blood cells were processed following similar protocol. samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 30 min and re-suspended in liquefied histogel. four-m sections blocks were cut and placed onto positively charged slides. RNA reverse transcription, amplification and quantification of a conserved region of the N gene was performed as described [20-22] real-time PCR for Cytokine analysis Quantification of blood IFN- (Mm 00801778_m1), IL-4 (Mm 00445259_m1), KC/CXCL1 (Mm 00433859_m1), MCP-1/CCL2 (Mm 99999056_m1) was performed by RSV was measured in nasal wash (NW), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), whole lung (WL) samples from 4-14 mice per time point per group from 4 independent experiments. Mice were intranasally inoculated with 107.6-8.3 PFU in 100 L of RSV or sterile media (non-infected controls) mice inoculated with HI-RSV or sham-inoculated controls had significantly lower RSV RNA loads in BAL and whole lung samples compared with mice infected with live-RSV. the highest blood RSV RNA loads were detected on days 4-7. mice inoculated with HI-RSV and uninfected controls did not have RSV RNA detected in the blood at any time point evaluated. the Y-axis represents the percentage of positive samples detected in each experimental condition and the X-axis the time points evaluated. one specimen per mouse (4 mice per group) from two independent experiments was harvested individually on day 5 post-inoculation. the identification of monocytes in peripheral blood was based on their morphology. cell-blocks from uninfected controls (n = 6) did not demonstrate any positive staining. all involved in the pathogenesis of acute RSV disease were sequentially measured from day 1 to 7 post-inoculation. experimental groups included mice inoculated with live RSV, HI-RSV, and non-infected controls. blood CCL2, CXCL1, IFN- and IL-4 mRNA expression was assessed from 4-6 mice per time-point per group. cytokines were comparable in non-infected controls and mice inoculated with HI-RSV at all time points evaluated. there was a significant but inverse correlation between blood RSV RNA loads and blood expression of CCL2 and CXCL1 on day 4 post-inoculation. penh values in mice infected with live RSV were significantly higher than in mice inoculated with HI-RSV and non-infected controls. penh values correlated with peripheral blood RSV-RNA loads in RSV infected mice on day 5 post-inoculation. severity of airway obstruction gradually increased from day 1 to day 5, peak of airway disease. from days 1 to 7 post-inoculation, changes included perivascular edema and margination of neutrophils. changes included dense perivascular and peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates. by immunohistochemical staining the alveolar epithelium showed a diffuse faint linear staining on day 1. no correlation between peak of blood RSV RNA loads and lung inflammation. treatment with anti-RSV moAb at 72 hours post-inoculation reduced both the duration and peak of blood RSV RNA loads. data shown are result of two separate experiments each with 4 mice per time-point per group. non-infected controls (grey circle), RSV-infected mice + treated 72 h later with anti-RSV moAb (black circle) and RSV infected-non treated mice (black triangle) were evaluated for AO. mice were intranasally inoculated with 107.6-8.3 PFU in 100 L of RSV or sterile media (non-infected controls) compared with non-infected controls, which had no viable virus detected at any time point. values represent means ( SD) of RSV log10 RNA copies/mL. comparisons were made by one way ANOVA; * p 0.001. from day 1 to 14 post-inoculation RSV RNA was detected in blood samples only in mice infected with live-RSV, heat-inactivated and sham inoculated controls. detecting peripheral blood RSV RNA significantly increased from 15% of positive samples on day 1 to 72% of samples on day 4. the Y-axis represents the percentage of positive samples detected in each experimental condition. the X-axis represents the peripheral blood RSV RNA loads in log10 copies/mL over time. blood viral loads increased from day 1 to day 5 post-inoculation. the identification of monocytes in peripheral blood was based on their morphology. cell-blocks from uninfected controls (n = 6) did not demonstrate any positive staining. three different pathologists reviewed slides in a blind fashion. blood CCL2, CXCL1, IFN- and IL-4 mRNA expression was assessed from 4-6 mice per time-point per group from days 1 to 7 after inoculation. mice were intranasally inoculated with live-RSV (solid grey bars), heat-inactivated RSV (hatched bars), or 10% EMEM (solid black bars). penh values were significantly increased in RSV-infected mice compared with controls and mice inoculated with HI-RSV from day 1 to 14 post-inoculation. penh values in mice infected with live RSV were significantly higher than in mice inoculated with HI-RSV and non-infected controls. correlations were computed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. severity of airway obstruction gradually increased from day 1 to day 5, peak of airway disease. compared with sham-inoculated controls, mice showed significantly greater HPS. changes included perivascular edema and margination of neutrophils (day 1). inflammatory infiltrates extended into surrounding alveolar septa in a stellate manner. changes included lymphocytes and macrophages, but no neutrophils or eosinophils. treatment with anti-RSV moAb at 72 hours post-inoculation reduced both the duration and peak of blood RSV RNA loads. mice treated with the moAb had blood RSV RNA loads detected only from day 4 to 7. airway obstruction was significantly reduced from day 4 (24 hours after treatment) to day 7 post-inoculation. penh was significantly lower in mice inoculated with RSV and treated with anti-RSV moAb at days 5 and 6 post-inoculation compared with non-treated mice. comparisons made by one way Analysis of Variance * p 0.05. the association between the detection of RSV in the blood and parameters of disease severity was inconclusive. a study conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with respiratory virus-associated pneumonia showed that serum RSV, hMPV and influenza virus RNA loads were significantly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation and death. there were no correlations with IFN- and IL-4, key Th1/Th2 adaptive immunity cytokines. the peak of blood RSV RNA loads did not correlate with the severity of lung inflammation. the detection of RSV RNA in the blood might be an earlier event in disease pathogenesis that precedes the establishment of severe pulmonary inflammation.
