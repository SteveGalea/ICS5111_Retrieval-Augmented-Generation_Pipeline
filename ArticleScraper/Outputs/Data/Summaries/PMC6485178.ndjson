{"summary": "lncRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in FOXO1-overexpressing PANC1 cells. LINC01197 expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. the novel FOXO1/LINC01197/-catenin axis was dysregulated during PDAC progression. our study provides insight into the mechanisms of LINC01197 in PDAC."}
