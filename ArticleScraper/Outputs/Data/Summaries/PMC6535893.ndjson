{"summary": "Purpose Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect after IRE and to evaluate the prognostic value of variations of the immune parameters. disease with extremely poor prognosis represented seventh and sixth leading causes of cancer-related death in the world and in china, respectively. Surgical resection is the only chance to obtain curative treatment while it is only suitable for less than 20% of patients with this disease [3]. Approximately 40% of new cases are diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is characterized by the involvement of major vascular structures. IRE-induced immunomodulatory was limited to the ablated areas, but also a systemic reaction. so far, data is rare on the predictive factors of IRE outcome in patients with LAPC. circulating biochemical markers may be the promising ones, for their relationship with cancer disease. radiologically confirmed LAPC was defined per the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer. no evidence of metastatic disease from abdominal and thoracic computed tomography. a total of 11 patients were excluded based on following exclusion criteria. es, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic index (PI) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) were also entered into this study. thresholds for the clinical or radiological variables were used as the cutoff values. d in a 37\u00b0C water bath and then cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 5% human AB type serum and labeled with FITC-, APC-, and/or PE-conjugated murine anti-human monoclonal antibodies. a microplate reader was used to read optimal density (OD) within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength. specific antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the incubation, the microplate reader (ClinicalBio 128c, Austria) was used to read OD within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength, whose reference was set to 630 nm [20]. follow-up The follow-up procedure was performed in accordance with previous publications and recommendations [21, 22]. radiologically confirmed LAPC was defined per the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer. no evidence of metastatic disease from abdominal and thoracic computed tomography. a total of 11 patients excluded based on following exclusion criteria. inflammation-based indexes included neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic index (PI) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) were also entered into this study. thresholds for clinical or radiological variables were used as the cutoff values. MCs were thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath and then cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 5% human AB type serum and labeled with FITC-, APC-, and/or PE-conjugated murine anti-human monoclonal antibodies. a microplate reader was used to read optimal density (OD) within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength. the microplate reader was used to read OD within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength. OS was defined as the duration from treatment until death or the last follow-up. the last follow-up was completed on September 30, 2018. median age was 59.5 years (range 45-73 years) most patients had lower values of inflammatory indexes, such as PLR, PI, and mGPS. patients with higher values of NLR occupied the majority of all patients. 3 25 73.5 > 3 9 26.5 CEA (ng/mL) 5 20 58.8 > 5 14 41.2 CA19-9 (U/ml) 35 8 23.5 > 35 26 76.5 NLR 1.47 9 26.5 > 1.47 25 73.5 PLR 165.29 22 64.7 > 165.29 12 35.3 PI 0 25 73.5 1 9 26.5 mGPS 0 29 85.3 1 4 11.8 2 2.9 LAPC. cytotoxic T cell (CD8+ T cell, identified as CD3+CD8+), regulatory T cell (Treg, identified as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+), and natural killer cell (NK cell, identified as CD3CD16+CD56+) before (preOP) and after IRE treatment (D3 and D7).

IRE may be a means of significant effort to overcome the immunosuppressive \u201ccold\u201d tumor microenvironment in LAPC. a potential treatment window of opportunity for immune-check-point therapy was suggested by increasing the effector T cells and decreasing immunosuppressive Treg cells. a slightly lower value of AUC for CD8+ T cell in PFS prediction suggested that, compared with PFS, maybe OS was affected more greatly by the changes of immune system. the human immune system played a more important role in long-term survival than in local control. the immunocytes measured in this study did not represent all the components in the microenvironment of LAPC after IRE therapy. a longer follow-up period is also needed for the comparison of effects of immunocytes on survival in LAPC patients."}
