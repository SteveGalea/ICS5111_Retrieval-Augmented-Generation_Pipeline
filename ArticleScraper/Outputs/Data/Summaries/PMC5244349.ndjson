{"summary": "the presence of an intact IFN-I response can be the difference between a high level of resistance to disease following virus infection and 100% lethality. wild-type mice are resistant to disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) but mice deficient for all IFN-I responses due to a lack of the receptor are highly susceptible and can succumb from lethal infection (1\u20136) the genus Flavivirus includes 53 currently recognized species (www.ictvonline.org) of which 40 are known to cause disease in humans (21) some of the more well-known human pathogens from this group are dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), west Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (TBEV) and ZIKV. NS5 is the largest (at approximately 900 amino acids) and most conserved of the flavivirus proteins. contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) that methylates the viral RNA (24) and in so doing disguises the viral RNA as self to prevent host recognition and promote translation. NS5 is also the most potent and direct antagonist of IFN-I-dependent JAK-STAT signaling encoded by all of the flaviviruses I stimulation for both NS5 function and recognition of ISGF3 67 WNV IFNAR1 Prolidase Suppression of IFNAR maturation and cell surface expression Not highly host species restricted 27 83 JEV Inhibits at or upstream of JAK activation Unknown May involve protein tyrosine phosphatases 81, 85, 86 TBEV IFNAR1 Prolidase Suppression of IFNAR maturation and cell surface expression Not highly host species kinase activation occurs through both auto- and transphosphorylation. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate the IFNAR to create docking sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2). STAT2 is then phosphorylated and recruits STAT1 for phosphorylation. small subgenomic RNA derived from the 3\u2032UTR termed small flavivirus RNA or sfRNA (39) sfRNA from multiple flaviviruses counters the IFN-I response (40) and at least in the case of DENV prevents the production of IFN-I by suppressing activation of RIG-I (41) additional strategies to suppress IFN production that may be more divergent across flaviviruses exist. the NS5 proteins of TBEV, LGTV, and WNV suppress maturation of the IFN-I receptor subunit IFNAR1 by binding to prolidase (PEPD) the host protein cullin 4 (CUL4) to degrade STAT via the proteasome. DENV is responsible for an estimated 96 million clinically recognized infections annually. loss of STAT2 is observed only if the N terminus of NS5 is produced. cleavage of NS5 to separate it from NS4B is mediated by the viral protease NS2B/3. the cleavage event did not need to be specific to the viral protease. the first 5 amino acids of DENV NS5 bind to ubiquitin protein ligase N-recognin 4 (UBR4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the N-recognin family (57) the binding domain in DENV NS5 for STAT2 is suggested as lying between residues 202 and 306 (53, 54, 57, 58) surface-exposed residues of the RdRp domain of WNV are depicted in green. amino acids important for function of NS5 from WNV, LGTV, and TBEV are shown in yellow. the evolution of dengue viruses in nonhuman primates may have influenced the ability of DENV to bind and degrade human STAT2. however, DENV NS5 binds UBR4 equally from human or mouse origin. this fact underlies one of the major limiting factors in the development of mouse models of DENV for the study of virus pathogenesis. expression of ZIKV NS5 alone results in STAT2 degradation without the need for the maturation of the NS5 N terminus by a cleavage event. however, the first 10 amino acids of ZIKV NS5 are not critically required for antagonism (64) SPOV NS5 localizes to the nucleus and prevents ISRE-dependent gene expression but without strong binding to the STATs. despite the availability of a highly protective live-attenuated vaccine for YFV, approximately 200,000 cases of yellow fever occur annually. FN-I stimulation is 2-fold: to induce STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers that render STAT2 amenable to NS5 binding and to promote K63-linked ubiquitination of a Lys residue in the NS5 N terminus. binding of STAT2 does not result in STAT degradation like it does in DENV or ZIKV but instead inhibits binding of ISGF3 to ISRE promoter elements. approximately 12,000 cases of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningitis still occur in Europe, Russia, and parts of Asia annually. the far Eastern TBEV strains are the most virulent, with case fatality rates estimated to be as high as 20%. however, while LGTV shares high amino acid identity with TBEV, it is considerably less neurovirulent. the two regions are proximal to each other when modeled on the crystal structure of the flavivirus RdRp (73) the suppression of JAK activation observed in LGTV-infected cells suggested that antagonism was mediated apically in the JAK-STAT cascade. instead, cells infected with either LGTV or TBEV lose expression of IFNAR1 but not IFNAR2 (27). neither lysosomal nor proteasomal inhibitors this work demonstrated for the first time that the function of flavivirus NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist is an important virulence factor in vivo. NS5 is a peptidase that cleaves dipeptides containing Pro to recycle Pro from dietary and endogenous proteins (78) but was not known to have a role in immunity. antagonize type I IFN by disrupting glycosylation and surface expression of IFNAR1. resistance to the antiviral effects of IFN-I is a determinant of virulence. resistance to the antiviral effects of IFN-I is a determinant of virulence for both WNV and JEV. a truncation mutant of LGTV NS5 containing residues 355 to 735 fully antagonizes signaling equivalent to the full-length protein. however, NS5 with a truncation at the N terminus does not retain activity (72) in support of this binding of the TBEV NS5 MTase domain aids in plasma membrane localization of NS5 and IFN-I antagonism. additional studies suggest that JEV NS5 expression downregulates calreticulin to inhibit nuclear translocation of STAT1 (86). however, how these activities of NS5 result in inhibition of Tyk2 phosphorylation and suppression of STAT nuclear localization are not known. this results in upregulation of antimicrobial peptides that reduce the pathogen burden in the tick. vertebrate cytokines can also stimulate the mosquito midgut (94) this may be particularly important for infection of tick species that feed over a number of days. further work to understand the relationship between IFN antagonism in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that enable virus maintenance in vectors. stress and membrane rearrangement is mediated by the small hydrophobic proteins NS4A and NS4B (76, 98), which may explain the ability of these viral proteins to modulate JAK-STAT signaling. NS2B and NS3 associate with lipid rafts in the context of DENV replication (100), and WNV recruitment of plasma membrane cholesterol to sites of virus replication in the ER is thought to disrupt IFN-I-dependent JAK-STAT signaling (97 no information exists as to how NS5 is regulated to perform functions in RNA replication and IFN-I antagonism. NS5 can form dimers with unique conformations (104), but multiple populations of NS5 exist in an infected cell. the first is the incorporation of loss-of-function mutations in NS5 as an attenuating mechanism to increase the safety of live-attenuated anti-flavivirus vaccines. the second is the engineering of improved immunocompetent mouse models in the case of flaviviruses that have restricted host-species tropism. this could be achieved by \u201chumanizing\u201d the viral targets of antagonism in the IFN-I response (20)"}
