{"summary": "antimicrobial proteins were first described in early 1960s with the identification of three basic proteins with bactericidal activities from a lysosomal fraction of guinea-pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes. AMPs are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. the majority of AMPs are known to interact with the lipid bilayer, leading to formation of ion channels, transmembrane pores, and membrane rupture bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), also known as shipping fever, is the most common infectious disease affecting older weanling, stocker, or feeder calves. BRDC develop as a complex interaction between environmental stress factors, host factors, and multiple viral and bacterial infectious agents. antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin derived peptides against BRDC pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida has been reported. compared to M. haemolytica isolates, P. multocida isolates were less susceptible to bovine NK-lysin mediated killing. NK2A [TVIEVASKMCSKMRLLKGLCKSITKRFLRR] and NK2C [TVIEEASKVCGKMGPLKGLCKSITKRFLRR] were synthesized by Peptide 2.0 Inc (Chantilly, VA) with over 95% purity. Lyophilized peptides were stored at -20\u00b0C, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and stored in aliquot one hundred microliter aliquots of bacterial suspension (1\u20135 105 CFUs) were placed in a non-tissue culture treated flat-bottom 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson) and gently mixed with 20 l of each of the diluted NK-lysin peptides. a 100 l aliquot of each dilution was spread on TSA sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for up to 2 days untreated and ethanol killed H. somni were used as live and dead controls. 50 microliters of propidium iodide were added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for additional 15 min. single (Syto 9 or propidium iodide) and double fluorescence dye labeled live and dead bacteria were included to further optimize acquisition gates and compensation for each fluorochrome. Approximately, 10,000 events were collected for data analysis. propidium iodide uptake assay was performed to determine kinetics of NK-lysin induced damage to H. somni cell membrane. samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 7.5% CO2 with constant shaking for 5 min. bacterial pellets were rinsed in cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in alcohols, and embedded in epoxy resin. ultrathin sections of the bacterial pellets were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. histophilus somni pneumonia isolate (2336) was kindly provided by the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University. all H. somni isolates were grown individually in trypticase soy agar supplemented with 10% glycerol. bacterial samples were then serially diluted in PBS. a 100 l aliquot of each dilution was spread on TSA sheep blood agar plates. bacterial colonies were enumerated for each dilution. cal laser-scanning microscopy Approximately 150 l of bacterial suspensions were adhered on glass slides using Shandon cytospin 2 and coversliped using BacLight mounting medium (ThermoFisher) live and dead bacteria were then visualized using proprietary NIS-Elements Advanced Research software. NK-lysin bacterial binding assay To determine binding of NK-lysin peptides with bacteria, H. somni was incubated with Cyanine dye 5 (Cy5)-conjugated NK2A peptide was chosen for Cy5 labeling. NK2A showed the highest antimicrobial activity, NK2A peptide was chosen for Cy5 labeling. samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 7.5% CO2 with constant shaking for 5 min. different concentrations of NK2A peptide (1, 2, 5, and 20 M final concentrations), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 or kanamycin (50 g/ml) were added into each well. t-test was used to compare percentages of live and dead H. somni in control and NK-lysin treated samples. the term significant indicates P value of less than 0.05. control H. somni isolates which were not incubated with any of the peptides but with PBS did not show detectable changes in the bacterial numbers (CFUs/ml) during 60 min incubation period. peptides showed higher antibacterial activity against all four bovine H. somni isolates. odide is a cell non-permeant red-fluorescent dye and stains DNA in cells with compromised cell membranes. majority of bacteria in control sample stained with Syto 9 (green, Fig 2A) and in killed bacteria stained with propidium iodide (red, Fig 2F) clumping of dead H. somni was observed following incubation with NK1 (Fig 2B) and NK2A (Fig 2C) live and dead H. somni in control (A), NK1 (B), NK2A (C), NK2B (C), NK2C (E) and ethanol treated (F) samples. H. somni were incubated with 20 M at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. bovine NK-lysins caused damage to H. somni cell membranes. but we wished to further evaluate whether NK-lysins can also interact with other bacterial targets, specifically with H. somni DNA. NK2A-Cy5 conjugate stained bacterial DNA with DAPI. lower, but time-dependent increases in PI uptake was also observed with lower concentrations of NK2A (1 and 2 M) higher PI uptake was observed with ethanol-killed and Trion X-100 treated samples. low-to-no PI uptake was observed with NK2A untreated and kanamycin treated samples. electron micrographic images were taken at 11,000 magnification. we calculated percent viable and dead H. somni in both control and NK2A treated samples. 45% dead bacteria with membrane damage, protrusions and clear zones of cytosol. bovine NK-lysin peptides killed H. somni isolates in a dose-dependent manner. at higher concentrations (10\u201330 M), all four peptides showed higher antibacterial activity against all four bovine H. somni isolates. at lower peptide concentrations (2 and 5 M), reduced antibacterial activity as well as variations in sensitivity among H. somni isolates was observed. H. somni isolates were sensitive to NK-lysin-derived peptides. it was not clear whether the antibacterial activity of NK-lysin peptides on H. somni were bactericidal or bacteriostatic. we performed Live/Dead bacterial viability staining after the incubation of H. somni with peptides. most of the bacteria in the control sample were viable with intact cell membranes. over 93% of H. somni, when incubated with NK-lysin peptides, were positive for propidium iodide staining or in the dead bacterial region. X axis indicates live bacteria (Syto 9) and Y axis indicates dead bacteria (propidium iodide) it has been previously reported that most antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) interact with lipid bilayer. some AMPs can interact with other intracellular targets such as nucleic acids. NK2A-Cy5 conjugate is shown in red and DAPI is shown in blue. in order to examine the kinetics of NK-lysin-induced H. somni cell membrane damage, we performed propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay in a time-dependent manner. control and NK2A treated H. somni samples for transmission electron microscopic assessment. both inner and outer membranes of control H. somni were intact. NK2A treatment led to extensively damaged H. somni cell membranes. NK2A, NK2B and NK2C peptides consistently displayed the highest antimicrobial activity against all four H. somni isolates. NK2A, NK2B and NK2C peptides showed the highest antibacterial activity against all four H. somni isolates. NK2C peptides showed the highest antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus [10] while NK2A and NK2C peptides showed the highest antimicrobial activity against M. haemolytica and H. somni isolates. differences in antibacterial activity among bovine NK-lysin peptides should be examined in future studies. confocal microscopic images confirmed the extensive damage to the bacterial cell membranes following incubation with NK-lysin peptides. electron micrographs confirmed the rupture of H. somni inner membranes when incubated with NK2A. NK-lysin induced damage to P. multocida cell membranes with cytosolic content leakage. NK-lysin peptides are highly effective against four different H. somni isolates, but at 10 M or higher concentrations. combination of NK-lysin peptides, particularly NK2A, with H. somni recombinant or subunit vaccines might provide enhanced protection in cattle."}
