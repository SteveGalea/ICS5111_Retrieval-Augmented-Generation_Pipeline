{"summary": "autophagy is a catabolic process that ensures the degradation and recycling of intra-cytoplasmic components. the cell also uses autophagy to degrade a broad range of endogenous or exogenous substrates. the best-studied endogenous substrates of autophagy are mitochondria and protein aggregates [2,3,4] autophagy autophagy was first described in 1966 by C. de Duve and R. Wattiaux. autophagy can be induced in response to various stressors such as lack of nutrients or growth factors, hypoxia, or infection. autophagy can be induced in response to various stressors such as lack of nutrients or growth factors, hypoxia, or infection. autophagosomes mature and fuse with the lysosomes where hydrolases degrade the substrates. soluble cytosolic proteins are recruited by the chaperone HSC70/HSP8A. substrate translocation into the lysosome requires a second HSC70 chaperone resident in the lysosomal lumen. the isolation membrane forms a double-membraned autophagosome that matures and eventually fuses with the lysosome, forming an autolysosome where lysosomal hydrolases degrade its content. the Atg12 conjugation system consists in the formation of the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex that then promotes the conjugation of LC3; pro-LC3 is cleaved by Atg4 ( ubiquitination is a complex process requiring the successive activity of three types of enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin-ligase enzyme. the ubiquitination of cysteine or serine and threonine residues requires the formation of thiol- or oxy-ester bonds respectively. ubiquitination was discovered in 1980 and first described for its essential role in targeting proteins to the proteasome for degradation. a broad range of types of ubiquitination have been reported. the hydrolysis of ubiquitin chains is conducted by a specific family of proteases: the DUBs. these enzymes can act at different stages of the protein ubiquitination process. the hydrolysis of ubiquitin chains can affect the fate of the protein they are added to. ubiquitination is catalyzed by three types of enzymes: E1, E2, E3. 100 DUBs encoded by the human genome [15,59] are divided into two main families. most abundant sub-family of DUBs is the USPs with over 50 members. autophagy can be induced in response to stressors such as lack of nutrients or growth factors, hypoxia, or infection. basal levels of autophagy also operate independently of any stress, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by the removal of dysfunctional or unnecessary proteins and organelles. autophagy processes differ by the way substrates are being delivered to the lysosome for degradation. autophagy is under control of sensor pathways that can sense availability of nutrients, growth factors, insulin or other stresses. AMPK and mTORC1 regulate the activation of the ULK1 complex. formation of an autophagosome starts with the generation of a phagophore. the major components of the autophagy machinery are the ATG (autophagy-related gene) proteins, which are required for the formation and maturation of the autophagosome. lack of nutrients leads to the down-regulation of TOR activity. lack of nutrients leads to the down-regulation of TOR activity. ubiquitination is a small globular protein with a -grasp superfold conformation. it is covalently conjugated by its terminal glycine onto a lysine residue of a substrate protein. the ubiquitination process can be broken down in two main steps. substrates can be modified by the attachment of a single ubiquitin molecule (mono-ubiquitination) or several single ubiquitin molecules on different lysine residues of the substrate. mono-ubiquitination is primarily described for its function in endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors. ubiquitin chains can also be assembled through N- to C-terminal interaction to form linear chains (M1) [50,51] ubiquitination is catalyzed by three types of enzymes: E1, E2, E3. the ubiquitination process involves cleaving the ubiquitin precursors to supply ubiquitin monomers to the ubiquitination enzymes. the hydrolysis of K48-linked ubiquitin chains can affect the fate of the protein. ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-hydrolases (UCHs), otubain proteases (OTUs), Machado Joseph disease proteases (MINDYs) most abundant sub-family of DUBs is the USPs with over 50 members, come after the OTUs (18 members), UCH, MJDs and MINDYs. OTUB1-C91A fails to remove ubiquitin moieties from DEPTOR. OTUB1 overexpression induces autophagy while its knockdown represses autophagy induction. under nutrient shortage, DEPTOR is stabilized by deubiquitination by OTUB1. deubiquitination of various protein aggregates by ZRANB1 or USP36 impairs degradation by autophagy. invasion by intra-cellular bacteria tends to induce accumulation of aggregate-like structures (ALIS) which are ubiquitinated and contribute to the induction of bacterial clearance by xenophagy. colored arrows show the action of DUBs that support (green) or inhibit (red) autophagy. green proteins are molecular inhibitors of autophagy. ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L may compete with USP20 to interact with ULK1. different types of ubiquitin chains, including K63- and K48-linked chains, were found on Beclin1. other studies have shown that USP14 is also able to cleave K63-linked ubiquitin chains. autophagy is highly interconnected with immune processes and can be triggered by activated TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) microbial components contribute to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and enzymes required for the signal transduction and induction of the immune response by NF-B. ubiquitination of the lysine residue 117 within the BH3 domain of Beclin1 prevents its interaction with the inhibitor Bcl-2. 63-linked ubiquitin chains on the lysine 117 of Beclin1 limit autophagy in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 [71] Interestingly, Beclin1 and the Bcl-2 family member, MCL-1, compete for their interaction with USP9X, which contributes to their stabilization by protecting them from proteasomal degradation in HEK293T cells. RALB-EXO84-Beclin1 is deubiquitinated at its lysine residue 47 in HEK293T and HeLa cells. the identification of USP33 as indirectly regulating Beclin1 activity through the deubiquitination of one of its partners reinforces the hypothesis that the modification and activation of autophagy machinery components are context-specific. a recent study identifies USP8 as one of the best markers of lewy bodies in human pigmented neurons in sporadic cases of Parkinson\u2019s disease. it demonstrates the ability of USP8 to hydrolyze K63-linked ubiquitin chains from -synuclein in vitro. the only DUB known to regulate ubiquitin-dependent autophagy negatively is dUSP36 [98] this protein negatively regulates the formation of ubiquitinated nuclear aggregates, while promoting cell growth. a new role for NDP52 in the formation of TRAF6 aggregates was unveiled. mitochondrial kinase Pink1 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin play a central role in the mitochondrial quality control. parkin is translocated to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) Upon mitochondria damage and loss of membrane potential, Parkin is activated by stabilized Pink1. three DUBs have been reported to counteract Parkin activity. USP30 proteolytic activity is more efficient on K6-linked ubiquitin chains. the ubiquitin chains targeted by USP30 are similar to the ones Parkin adds to its substrates. the majority of the work carried out on the regulation of mitophagy have relied on cells overexpressing Parkin along with the use of mitochondrial-depolarizing agents. USP30 acts at different levels during the mitophagy or pexophagy processes. other studies identified additional DUBs which may also contribute to the regulation of mitophagy. only one DUB, USP8, may act as a positive regulator of mitophagy through Parkin regulation. hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit (HIF-1) is a transcription factor essential for cells to adapt rapidly to low oxygen levels. loss of Cezanne reduces the amount of HIF-1 protein while Cezanne overexpression stabilizes HIF-1 and protects it from autophagic degradation. USP8 interacts with and deubiquitinates Cx43 via endocytosis and autophagy. ubiquitination and degradation by autophagy are increased in usp8 knockdown cells. fusion events between autophagosomes and endocytic compartments have been observed. the loss of AMSH in neurons results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates associated with the autophagy receptor p62. however, at this stage of the study, it is not possible to discriminate whether the blockade of the autophagy flux results from an impairment in the endocytic process or a lack of targeting of cargoes to autophagosome. rosophila and mammalian cells negatively regulate endocytosis and translocation of the Notch receptor to the lysosomes. these studies support a close imbrication of endocytosis and autophagy. the particular case of the 2-adrenergic receptors (2-ARs) also illustrates a reliable interconnection between the endocytic and autophagic processes. endosomes-associated DUBs such as USP8 and AMSH may also play a direct regulatory role in this process. a number of genes related to autophagy are activated upon starvation in mammalian cell culture. in this process, histone protein H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is an essential modification for the regulation of gene transcription. intracellular pathogenic bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) counteracts the ALIS-induced autophagy by translocating a DUB-like enzyme, SseL (Salmonella-secreted factor L) into the cytosol. these bacteria are more prone to ubiquitination and recognition by autophagy markers such as LC3 or p62. RavZ protease prevents the recruitment of autophagy receptors p62 and NDP52 to the vacuoles. the lack of autophagy receptors at the SCVs is due to the removal of ubiquitin moieties by RavZ. PLP2-TM promotes the interaction of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) with Beclin1. mTORC1 plays a central role in the integration of various environmental signals to regulate cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival. mTORC1 is active and promotes cell growth while down-regulating autophagy. deubiquitination by OTUB1 inhibits beclin1 activity by promoting its interaction with the inhibitor Bcl-2. other DUBs positively regulate autophagy by stabilizing Beclin1 (USP9X, USP10, USP13, USP19) USP8 promotes parkin-mediated mitophagy by deubiquitinating Parkin's substrates, thus impairing mitophagy. deubiquitination of HIF-1 and Connexin-43 (Cx43) prevents their lysosomal degradation. loss-of-function screen identified USP20 as the first DUB involved in regulating ULK1 ubiquitination and stability. the maintenance of basal levels of ULK1 by USP20 contributes to rapid induction of autophagy under stress condition. however, the interaction between ULK1 and USP20 is weakened upon prolonged induction of autophagy (4 to 8 h) different types of ubiquitin chains, including K63- and K48-linked chains, were found on Beclin1. several DUBs control Beclin1 ubiquitination status and activity. USP14 is a ubiquitin-specific protease tightly associated with the proteasome. ubiquitination of the lysine residue 117 within the BH3 domain of Beclin1 prevents its interaction with the inhibitor Bcl-2 [71,72]. LR4 in macrophages through the ubiquitination of Beclin1 with K63-ubiquitin chains in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 [71]. the addition of K11-linked ubiquitin chains to Beclin1 triggers its degradation by the proteasome. the enzymes USP13 and USP19 are known to process K11-linked ubiquitin chains resulting in the stabilization of Beclin1 in HEK293T cells. lysine residues in Beclin1 may be ubiquitinated with K11-linked chains. protease OTUB1 was recently reported to inhibit mTORC1 activity by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the inhibitor DEPTOR in response to amino acid deprivation. OTUB1-C91A fails to remove ubiquitin moieties from DEPTOR and protect it from proteasomal degradation. the deubiquitination of RALB by USP33 favors their degradation by autophagy. UCH-L1 contribute to the accumulation of -synuclein by downregulating its lysosomal degradation by autophagy. dUSP8 and dUSP12 positively regulate autophagy by contributing to the biogenesis of the lysosome. colored arrows show the action of DUBs that support (green) or inhibit (red) autophagy. pink proteins are molecular inhibitors of autophagy; green proteins are inducers of autophagy. the molecular mechanisms regulating the dissociation of USP20 and ULK1 are not known yet but could depend on posttranslational or allosteric modifications on USP20. alternatively, the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, may compete with USP20 to interact with ULK1 and promote its proteasomal degradation. USP14 suppresses the activity of Beclin1 complex and induction of autophagy by interacting with and controlling K63- rather than K48-linked ubiquitin chains of Beclin1 [70]. ubiquitination of the lysine residue 117 within the BH3 domain of Beclin1 prevents its interaction with the inhibitor Bcl-2 [71,72] the study does not provide any evidence for the catalytic role of USP14. it suggests that the interaction of Beclin1 with USP14 inhibits ubiquitination of Beclin1. however, the study does not provide any evidence for the catalytic role of USP14. lysine 437 of Beclin1 in HEK293T and HeLa cells suggests its function may not be redundant, but instead complementary to USP13. RALB-EXO84-Beclin1 is deubiquitinated at its lysine residue 47 in HEK293T and HeLa cells. ynuclein in vitro and in vivo contributes to removal of mono-ubiquitin moieties. UCH-L1 contributes to -synuclein neurotoxicity, possibly by negatively regulating its lysosomal degradation. a recent study identifies the prevalence of K63-linked ubiquitin chain conjugates in lewy bodies. selective autophagy receptor p62 binds to protein aggregates modified with K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Knockdown of ZRANB1 suggests that ZRANB1 is a negative regulator of aggrephagy. however, little is known about the regulation of autophagy-associated ubiquitination processes in flies. ubiquitination of NDP52, mediated by TRAF6, is necessary for its activity and is counteracted by A20 [101]. a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms associated with each pathology will greatly benefit the development of appropriate and targeted treatments. USP30 knockdown also increases ubiquitination level on multiple Parkin substrates. ubiquitin chains targeted by USP30 are similar to ones Parkin adds to its substrates. majority of the work carried out on the regulation of mitophagy have relied on cells overexpressing Parkin along with the use of mitochondrial-depolarizing agents. the depletion of USP30 increases both pexophagy and mitophagy. however, the localization of USP30 on mitochondria relies on distinct sequences. it is possible that USP30 acts at different levels during the mitophagy or pexophagy processes. only a few substrates, known to be directly targeted for degradation by autophagy in response to ubiquitination, have been shown to be regulated by a specific DUB. the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit (HIF-1) is a transcription factor essential for cells to adapt rapidly to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) different DUBs can regulate the fate of a shared substrate depending on the physiology of the cell. connexin-43/Cx43 polyubiquitination triggers its degradation through either the proteasome or the lysosome via endocytosis and autophagy. mono-ubiquitination of -synuclein seems to be required for its targeting of proteasomal degradation and thus negatively regulates its autophagic degradation. UCH-L1 contributes to -synuclein neurotoxicity, possibly by negatively regulating its lysosomal degradation. the presence of USP8 on endosomal membranes and in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cultured cells makes it a preferred therapeutic target according to the assumption that inhibition of USP8 could directly promote the elimination of amyloid fibers. the selective autophagy receptor p62 binds to protein aggregates modified not only with K63-linked ubiquitin chains but also with K33-linked ubiquitin chains. ubiquitination of NDP52, mediated by TRAF6, is necessary for its activity and is counteracted by A20 [101] with the variety of proteins prone to aggregations, it is not surprising that different DUBs are involved in the regulation of the formation and degradation of protein aggregates. USP30 is a mitochondrial enzyme, tethered to the outer membrane of the mitochondria with its catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm. overexpression of USP30 reverses the ubiquitination of Parkin substrates, such as TOM20, and impairs mitophagy. the depletion of USP30 increases the ubiquitination level on multiple Parkin substrates. the depletion of USP30 increases both pexophagy and mitophagy. the role of USP30 in pexophagy is independent to its mitochondrial function. s-USP35 is another DUB localized at the mitochondria. usp8 knockdown impairs Parkin-mediated mitophagy by preventing parkin recruitment of depolarized mitochondria. only a few substrates, known to be directly targeted for degradation by autophagy, have been shown to be regulated by a specific DUB. USP8 is essential for the removal of ubiquitin moieties on HIF-1 in normoxia. in this case, however, USP8 appears to protect HIF-1 from proteasomal degradation. endocytosis and autophagy converge not only at the level of lysosomes but also at the level of early and late endosomes. AMSH localizes at the endosomes and promotes the recycling of internalized receptors. dUSP12 depletion affects both the autophagic flux and endocytosis process. dUSP12 negatively regulates the endocytosis and translocation of the Notch receptor to the lysosomes in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. ubiquitinated 2-ARs are directed to the autophagosomes rather than the lysosomes. the post-endocytic sorting of the receptor from the endosomes to the autophagosomes is modulated by the proteases USP20 and USP33. phosphorylation of USP20 at serine residue 333 is required for its activity providing an additional level of regulation. encoding gene blocks induction of autophagy in mESCs (mouse embryonic stem cells) this study thus unveils new role for DUB in the transcriptional regulation of autophagy through the modulation of H2B monoubiquitination. eukaryotic cells use ubiquitination of microbial molecular patterns to tag invasive pathogens. Legionella is an intracellular bacterium that can establish niches in cytoplasmic vacuoles. LC3 is an autophagy-related ubiquitin-like protein anchored to the autophagosome membrane. the process leading to LC3 lipidation and association to the membrane is similar to the ubiquitination process and requires a ubiquitin-like conjugation system. viruses induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles that allow for their replication and are often decorated with LC3. the non-structural protein PLP2-TM is sufficient for the accumulation of autophagosomes in different cell lines. however, its role in the regulation of autophagy is independent of its protease activity [161] the challenge of Developing Drugs Targeting DUBs Efficiency and usability of an inhibitor depends on its specificity. the discovery of DUB-focused drugs has been challenging [20]. a screen of 63,052 compounds using proteasome reconstituted with USP14 led to the identification of the first inhibitor of USP14. the small-molecule IU1 blocks the activity of USP14 only in the presence of the proteasome, suggesting that it binds only to the activated enzyme. IU1 abrogates the catalytic activity of USP14 without affecting its noncatalytic regulatory function. IU1-47 treatment of murine primary neuron cultures and in neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells accelerates the degradation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. inhibition of USP14 by IU1-47 induced an increase of the autophagy flux, consistent with the increased degradation rate of Tau [175] UCH-L1 is a negative regulator of autophagy widely studied for its implication in Parkinson\u2019s disease and its contribution to the aggregation of - the inhibitor was reported to lead to an increase in ULK1 ubiquitination. it was speculated that the inhibition of USP9X could be responsible for the accumulation and subsequent aggregation of ubiquitinated ULK1. however, silencing Usp9X did not result in changes in ULK1 expression level when cells were treated with WP1130. several small-molecule inhibitors of USP30 have been developed in the past few years. the inhibition of USP30 by the compound 15-oxospiramilactone enhances the activity of USP30\u2019s targets Mfn1 and Mfn2. this compound has the opposite effect of 15-oxospiramilactone. the binding of the molecules into the active site of USP7 modifies the catalytic residue C223. this modification results in its inability to change conformation and perform the cleavage of ubiquitin chains. the development of specific inhibitors binding to the active site of USP7 is a realistic approach. screen of 63,052 compounds using proteasome reconstituted with USP14 led to the identification of the first inhibitor of USP14. the small-molecule IU1 blocks the activity of USP14 only in the presence of the proteasome, suggesting that it binds only to the activated enzyme. IU1 blocks the activity of USP14 without affecting its noncatalytic regulatory function. UCH-L1 is expressed in various primary lung tumors while not detectable in normal, healthy lung tissue. the compound LDN-57444 was identified in a high throughput drug screening as a specific UCH-L1 inhibitor. it is already known to inhibit USP2 and USP7. spautin-1 inhibits the catalytic activity of both USP10 and USP13 with an IC50 of 0.6\u20130.7 M. spautin-1 is a potential lead for the development of autophagy inhibitors for anti-cancer therapies. this compound has the opposite effect of 15-oxospiramilactone. this compound has the opposite effect of 15-oxospiramilactone. this compound has the opposite effect of 15-oxospiramilactone. this compound has the opposite effect of 15-oxospiramilactone. pleiotropic effects."}
