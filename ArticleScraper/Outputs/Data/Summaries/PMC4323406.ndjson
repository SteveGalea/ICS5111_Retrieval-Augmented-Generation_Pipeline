{"summary": "more than 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the world health organization. as of July 25, 2014, 41% of the 721 cases detected in KSA have died. as of march 25, 2014, 41% of the 721 cases detected in KSA have died. asymptomatic cases and cases with an otherwise missing date of onset are shown at the date the case first tested positive for MERS-CoV. the scale of the 2014 outbreak renewed concerns about the potential for MERS-CoV transmission in pilgrims visiting KSA for the Hajj in October 2014. projections were developed as part of real-time modeling and epidemiological analysis performed in support of the KSA Ministry of Health\u2019s MERS-CoV planning efforts. based on a complete line list of individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection in KSA between June 7, 2012 and June 30, 2014 provided by the KSA MoH. the weekly risk of infection will match the age-adjusted average experienced by residents of the Makkah region during the four peak incidence weeks of 2014. non-Saudis are assumed to have no risk of MERS-CoV infection prior to the Hajj, and Saudis are assumed either to have the risk seen in the Makkah region during June 2014. on average, 500,000 foreign visitors are assumed to attend Umrah each month. we assume an average reproductive number of 0.63 and mean generation time of 10-11 days,11 and onward transmission is assumed to be truncated. infection risk per one-million attendees is projected to be higher among foreign pilgrims due to their generally older age. under the expected incidence scenario, we would expect to see 11.7 cases (95% PI, 5-20); and 47.6 cases (95% PI, 32-66) under the very high incidence scenario.
