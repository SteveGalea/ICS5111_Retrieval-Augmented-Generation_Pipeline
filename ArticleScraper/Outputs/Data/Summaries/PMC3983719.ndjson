{"summary": "the power of a systems perspective The immune response to vaccination depends on interactions between a multitude of factors, including genetic, epigenetic, physiologic and environmental factors. the discovery of biomarkers (e.g. omic signatures) capable of predicting an individual's response to vaccination may allow for the development of more individualized vaccination strategies. the integration of multi-omic measurements (proteomic, transcriptomic, etc.) along with information about host\u2013pathogen interactions will allow for a system-level view of the host reponse to infection. analysis with network-based approaches (module identification, differential network analysis, etc.) will enable discoveries about the host immune response. the influenza vaccine producing a strong interferon signature and the pneumococcal vaccine producing an increase in inflammation-related transcripts [17] the authors suggest that comparing global immune response elicited by different vaccines will be critical to our understanding of the immune mechanisms underpinning successful vaccination. this infectome was constructed by integrating 416 viral proteins into a human protein\u2013protein interaction network through manually curated virus\u2013host protein interactions. Navratil and colleagues found that viral proteins interact with approximately 5% of human proteins, and that a significant number of these targeted proteins interact with multiple viruses or virus families. findings suggest common molecular mechanisms of infection across viruses. repurposing of Imatinib and Crizotinib for additional cancer types is example of the benefits gained from precision medicine. in infectious disease research most work in the area of drug repositioning has been done for antimicrobial treatments [35, 36, 37], but with increasing knowledge about host\u2013virus interactions and the evolutionary relationships between viruses. advent of systems-level omics characterization offers unprecedented opportunity for vaccine discovery, development, and delivery. if this framework is embraced, it could lead to a substantial decrease in vaccine failure and adverse events, providing a significant benefit to global health."}
