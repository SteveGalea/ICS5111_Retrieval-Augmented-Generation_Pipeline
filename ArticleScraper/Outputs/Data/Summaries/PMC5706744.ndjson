{"summary": "viral genomes do not encode protein synthesis machinery, which is necessary for productive infection. the list can extend to signaling proteins and transcription factors as well. antiviral strategies that exploit the viral dependence on host factors have emerged. spermidine, homospermidine, norspermidine, putrescine, cadaverine, and 1,3-diaminopropane in bacteria and agmatine, spermidine, spermidine, norspermidine, and norspermine in archaea. polyamine levels also affect the translation and activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAM) polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (A) are synthesized from the ornithine precursor via a series of enzymatic reactions (B) that elongate the structure of the polyamine and add amino groups. the biogenic polyamines are highlighted in purple, while catabolic enzymes are displayed in orange. polyamines play diverse roles within the cell and alter many of the cellular processes that viruses rely on for their replication. eIF5A is the only known protein in the cell that contains hypusine, and hypusination is critical for its eIF5A function (22). polyamines are abundant molecules consisting of flexible carbon chains with amino groups that are positively charged at neutral pH. spermidine, norspermidine, putrescine, cadaverine, and 1,3-diaminopropane in bacteria and agmatine, spermidine, homospermidine, norspermidine, and norspermine in archaea. polyamine levels also affect the translation and activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (A) are synthesized from the ornithine precursor via a series of enzymatic reactions (B) that elongate the structure of the polyamine and add amino groups. polyamines alter DNA structure by facilitating conformational transition from the B form to the Z form (15), or by bending DNA (16\u201318). spermine has also been implicated in the stabilization of tRNA structure (19, 20) eIF5A has been suggested to facilitate mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA stability (23, 24). eIF5A has been suggested to facilitate mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA stability (23, 24). eIF5A has been suggested to facilitate mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport. viral DNA dissociated from viral inclusions MGBG 2.9-fold 45 Upregulation of ODC activity 46 Human cytomegalovirus dsDNA Polyamines Reduction of infectious virus produced. DFMO 4-log, 6-log 43, 84 Semliki Forest virus (+)ssRNA Polyamines Decreased activity of viral RNA polymerase DFMO 10-fold 60, 61 Chikungunya virus (+)ssRNA Polyamines Decreased activity of viral eIF5A Reduction in infectious virus produced CPX 3-log 64 Human immunodeficiency virus ssRNA-RT eIF5A Required for Rev-dependent nuclear transport eIF5A mutants 67 Decrease in virus production. peak reduction represents experimental time point/condition where the peak effect was observed. polyamines are thought to facilitate viral DNA packaging by allowing compaction. RNA viruses also encapsidate polyamines but to a lesser extent than DNA viruses, suggesting a less significant role in facilitating packaging. on vaccinia virus, infected cells exhibit upregulation of ODC enzyme activity. vaccinia virus significantly inhibits host translation early in infection. HCMV also stimulates ODC activity within infected cells. the differences between HSV and HCMV may reflect distinctions in the infectious cycle for these viruses, such as HCMV's predilection for an S-phase-like cell state or host shutoff by HSV. the list of RNA viruses sensitive to polyamine depletion has been extended to include diverse families. alphaviruses (chikungunya virus [CHIKV]), coronaviruses (MERS) virus, enteroviruses (enterovirus A71 and poliovirus), flaviviruses (dengue virus serotype 1, japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus) and bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus were also sensitive to a depletion of polyamines at the level of translation (62). eIF5A and Virus Replication Precisely how translation of viral mRNAs is impacted by polyamines had not been fully understood, but further studies highlighted the unique hypusination of eIF5A as a critical mediator of filovirus protein translation. the requirement of hypusinated eIF5A is likely required for EBOV mRNA translation. eIF5A has been found to be important in various aspects of protein translation. recent work suggests that eIF5A plays a broader role in translation than previously thought. DFMO, an inhibitor of ODC1, has shown significant promise in the treatment of various cancers in combination therapies. the trypanosomes that infect via the bite of a tsetse fly show sensitivity to polyamine depletion. DFMO is able to target the trypanosomal ODC1 homolog (71) SAT1 Acetylation of spermidine and spermine, interconversion and removal of polyamines 91 GC7 DHPS Reduction in eIF5A-hypusine levels 92, 93 DEF DOHH Reduction in eIF5A-hypusine levels 92, 93 CPX DOHH Reduction in eIF5A-hypusine levels 92 a DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; MGBG, treatment of cells with the molecule N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSpm) results in upregulation of SAT1 and subsequent acetylation of spermidine and spermine. treatment of cells with the molecule N1,N11-diethylnorspermine results in the upregulation of SAT1 and subsequent acetylation of spermidine and spermine, leading to the reconversion into putrescine or export. the use of GC7 is an effective strategy to control EBOV replication in cell culture. the compounds ciclopirox (CPX) and deferiprone (DEF) have clinical applications as topical antifungal agents. their antiviral properties in cell culture make them enticing compounds to treat viral infection. Viruses have developed various mechanisms to facilitate tight packing. balancing negative charge with a positively charged domain of a capsid protein. several DNA viruses utilize polyamines to balance the negatively charged genome within the virion particle. svirus and the etiological agent of chicken pox, is also stimulated by polyamines (41). the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of vaccinia virus can also be stimulated in an in vitro transcription assay with the addition of spermine or spermidine in combination with Mg2+ or Mn2+ (42). vaccinia virus infection significantly inhibits host translation early in infection. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) similarly stimulates ODC activity within infected cells. other viruses alter polyamine levels and biosynthetic enzymes upon infection. 2.b2) unique to a bovine gammaherpesvirus (bovine herpesvirus 6) shows sequence similarity to ornithine decarboxylase, with 53 to 56% amino acid sequence identity. how this gene functions in the context of infection is unknown. modulation of polyamine levels by DNA viruses. vaccinia virus significantly inhibits host translation early in infection. paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 encodes a complete polyamine biosynthetic pathway (55\u201358) the presence of these virus genes speaks to the importance of polyamines in PBCV-1 replication. rhabdoviruses (rabies virus), bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus) and filoviruses (ebolavirus [EBOV] were also recently shown to require polyamines through depletion with DFMO treatment (64). this suggests targeting of polyamines is feasible in a range of cell types which can support various viral infections. the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus were also sensitive to a depletion of polyamines at the level of translation (62) eIF5A and Virus Replication Precisely how translation of viral mRNAs is impacted by polyamines had not been fully understood. eIF5A is a critical mediator of filovirus protein translation. treatment of cells with ciclopirox (an inhibitor of DOHH) resulted in a 3-log reduction in infectious titers of these viruses. further mechanistic probing using EBOV minigenome system suggested that hypusinated eIF5A is likely required for EBOV mRNA translation. SAT1 acts as a viral restriction factor that limits infection by reducing polyamine levels in cells. DFMO, an inhibitor of ODC1, has shown significant promise in the treatment of various cancers in combination therapies.
