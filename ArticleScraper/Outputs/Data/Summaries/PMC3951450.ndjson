{"summary": "CCHF virus (CCHFv) causes a severe human disease, with a fatality rate of 15\u201370%. CCHF is endemic in many countries in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and southern Africa. non-endemic countries are also at risk from imported cases. CCHFv is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen by the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. progress with CCHFv research has been severely hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model. newborn mice succumb to infection, but due to their immature immune systems, they cannot be used for assessing vaccine efficacy. the M segment encodes a polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage events [14], [15]. it contains a single open reading frame of 1685 residues (in strain IbAr10200), which is processed into mature glycoproteins GN and GC. the GN and GC glycoproteins of CCHFv bind target cells and influence infectivity and cell tropism. a candidate vaccine based on recombinant MVA expressing the CCHFv glycoproteins can be induced by MVA, without the requirement for an adjuvant. we adapted a previously described animal model to mimic infection by tick bite. SW13 (accession number 87031801) and Vero E6 (accession number 85020206) cells were cultured in leibovitz's modified eagle medium. CCHFv (strain IbAr10200) was amplified in suckling mouse brain. attB1 and attB2 sequences were added to the beginning and end of the remaining open reading frame. the resulting sequence was synthesised and then recombined into pDONR (Life Technologies) by Entelechon (Germany) to generate plasmid pENTR-GP. GP vaccination Groups of 5\u201312 mice aged 5\u20138 weeks were injected intramuscularly into the caudal thigh with 107 pfu/animal of non-recombinant MVA-GP diluted in endotoxin-free PBS. control animals received 107 pfu/animal of non-recombinant MVA-GP or an equivalent volume of saline. SW13 cells were infected with CCHFv at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 2% FBS. the medium was removed 48 hours post-infection and the cells were treated with Laemmli buffer supplemented to contain 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich) primary antibodies used were mouse anti-V5 (AbD Serotec) diluted 1/5000. primary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1/8000. secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG/A/M (AbD Serotec) diluted 1/4000. samples, diluted in 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS 0.05% Tween-20, were added to plates at 100 l/well in triplicate. plates were washed three times before adding 100 l/well of polyclonal HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/A/M (AbD Serotec), diluted 1/4000 in 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS 0.05% Tween-20. surviving animals were killed humanely at 14 days post-challenge. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected as at 4 days post-challenge. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for viral load studies. a heat-induced epitope retrieval cycle with buffer ER1 R (Leica Biosystems) was performed for 10 minutes. slides were incubated with rabbit serum (4%) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 20 minutes followed by an avidin/biotin blocking stage (15 minutes each) each sample was analysed for levels of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene. a one-step RT-PCR was performed targeting an 89 bp product in the mouse HPRT gene (NCBI Reference sequence NM_013556) the Mann-Whitney U test was performed using GraphPad Prism software. predicted molecular weights of proteins were calculated using EditSeq software. animals female A129 (IFN/R-/-) and 129Sv/Ev mice, aged 5-8 weeks, were obtained from B&K Universal (UK) CCHFv was amplified in suckling mouse brain and homogenised with a disposable pestle and mortar. plasmids A cassette containing Gateway system attR1 and attR2 recombination sequences was generated. downstream side was adjacent to an 8 residue linker sequence followed by the 14 residue V5 epitope [28] and a stop codon. Plasmids pDEST44-TPA-V5 and pENTR-GP were recombined using Gateway technology to generate plasmid pTP-GP. infected cells were transfected with pTP-GP using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) as directed by the manufacturer. resulting recombinant MVA-GP was serially plaque-purified 4 times in BHK-21 cells. total volume of 100 l was delivered to each animal across two sites. animals were euthanised and tissues were collected 21 or 28 days after primary vaccination. infected cells were infected with CCHFv at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. the medium was removed 48 hours post-infection and the cells were treated with Laemmli buffer supplemented to contain 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich) uninfected SW13 monolayers were treated similarly, as a negative control. secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1/8000, anti-rabbit IgG/A/M (AbD Serotec) diluted 1/4000, or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1/5000. dilutions were made in PBS containing 0.05% NP40 and 5% milk protein. ABTS ELISA HRP substrate (KPL, USA) was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. plates were washed three times after 1 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C. CCHFv challenge of A129 mice received 200 TCID50 CCHFv. at 14 days post-challenge all surviving animals were killed humanely. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for viral load studies. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for histopathological examination. antibody against recombinant CCHFv nucleoprotein was incubated with the tissue for 30 minutes, followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1500, for 10 minutes, followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibody (Abcam) a one-step RT-PCR was performed targeting an 89 bp product in the mouse HPRT gene using the QuantiFast probe assay (Qiagen) and the ABi 7500 RT-PCR platform. all reactions were run in triplicate. pTP-GP encoded a tPA-GP-V5 fusion protein 14 nucleotides downstream of the mH5 poxvirus promoter. pTP-GP also encoded the enhanced GFP gene downstream of the p11 promoter for insertion into the same locus. PCR of the insert site produced a single, recombinant-specific product. the insertion site failed to amplify a parent-specific product. no spontaneous mutations in the transgene had been introduced. a positive control (lane 2) expressed a V5 fusion protein of 62 kDa. CCHFv-specific products were detected at approximately 109, 60, 34 and 20 kDa. CCHFv-specific products were detected at approximately 109, 60, 34 and 20 kDa. CCHFv-specific products were also detected in uninfected SW13 cells. 107 pfu/animal MVA-GP or MVA 1974, or an equivalent volume of saline, at day 0 and day 14. splenocytes and serum were harvested for histological analysis. lesions in liver and spleen were not detected in vaccinated mice at day 21. vaccinated animals were restimulated with peptides derived from the CCHFv glycoprotein. a129 mice data (solid bars) were pooled from 2 independent experiments (n = 8) 129Sv/Ev mice n = 5 (hatched bars) Mean SEM is plotted. a randomly selected A129 mouse that received the MVA 1974 negative control was tested. no CCHFv-specific antibody response was seen. vaccinated mice were tested for reactivity with CCHFv-infected cells. sera from the remaining 3 A129 mice did not recognise any CCHFv-specific proteins. in a separate study, 5\u20136 weeks old A129 mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 107 pfu/animal MVA-GP or MVA 1974 (25 mice per group) at day 0. At day 28, sera were collected, heat inactivated and pooled. each pool contained sera from 5\u20136 animals. four pools from mice vaccinated with MVA-GP were tested, which reached endpoint titres of 114, 85, 323 and 208. one pool from mice vaccinated with MVA 1974 was weakly positive with an endpoint titre of 33. the remaining 2 pools tested were below the lower limit of detection. the assay was repeated using a conjugate specific for IgM only. all positive A129 samples therefore contained predominantly IgG at day 28. concentrations of 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID50 (5 animals per group) showed that 100 TCID50 was the lowest dose that caused 100% of infected A129 mice to reach humane clinical endpoints. control animals lost 5\u201310% of their original body weight within 3\u20135 days of challenge. weights of the vaccinated mice remained stable throughout the study. all mice vaccinated with CCHFv survived lethal challenge. changes comprised multifocal to diffuse, hepatocyte necrosis, characterised by cytoplasmic eosinophilia and nuclear pyknosis. hepatocyte necrosis accompanied frequently with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. at day 32, in the spleen, minimal changes were seen in two out of three animals. moderate changes were identified in the liver characterised by multifocal changes of hepatocyte necrosis and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration. in the remaining six animals in this group, which survived to day 42, lesions were not identified. a129 mice were challenged with double the minimum lethal dose of CCHFv. sections of spleen (A, D) and liver (B\u2013C, E) were fixed, immunohistochemically stained with CCHFv-specific antibody, and examined microscopically. CCHFv expression was normalised to expression of the HPRT reference gene. in the control groups at day 32, viral RNA was detected in all tissues tested. normalised CCHFv expression was significantly lower in vaccinated animals. pTP-GP encoded a tPA-GP-V5 fusion protein 14 nucleotides downstream of the mH5 poxvirus promoter. pTP-GP encoded the enhanced GFP gene downstream of the p11 poxvirus promoter for insertion into the same locus. no significant difference in viral load between 4 days and 14 days post-challenge. terminus was fused to the 14 amino acid residue V5 epitope via 11 residues of Gateway sequence, and 8 residues of a linker peptide. the insertion cassette also contained the enhanced GFP gene downstream of the p11 promoter, for identification of recombinant virus. the mucin-like domain is represented by \u2018mu\u2019. Western blot analysis of glycoproteins expressed by MVA-GP and CCHFv. a positive control (lane 2) expressed a V5 fusion protein of 62 kDa. major products expressed by MVA-GP correspond with those expressed by CCHFv. major products expressed by MVA-GP are most likely to be PreGN (a GN precursor), GC, and GN with sizes of 109, 75 and 37 kDa. it is unclear why CCHFv-expressed GC and GN appear to be of a lower molecular weight than previously reported. the peptide pools inducing the highest ELISPOT responses were GP4, GP5, GP1 and GP2. the majority of the GN protein, except for 57 C-terminal residues, mapped to pool GP3 and did not induce a specific T-cell response. the non-structural domains therefore contained highly immunogenic T-cell epitopes. no statistical difference in immune responses was observed between strains of mice. responses to peptides derived from the tPA or V5 regions were negligible. sera from the 8 A129 animals vaccinated with MVA-GP were also assessed by Western blot for an early phase immune response. antibodies specific for a 79 kDa CCHFv protein were detected in the same animal that had tested positive with anti-IgG only. one of the serum pools from the vaccinated control group was tested for IgG antibodies. the remaining pool could not be adequately assessed due to high background staining. most 129Sv/Ev animals had a detectable IgG response. normal mouse serum (black) was a negative control. absorption of diluted samples, and curve fit, from which endpoint titres were calculated where y = 0.250. each point represents one of triplicate values for each pool. the lower limit of detection was 25. on day 28, animals were challenged with 200 TCID50 CCHFv intradermally (i.e. double the minimum lethal dose) at 14 days post-challenge (day 42), all remaining animals were killed humanely and samples collected for histology and viral load testing. animals in the control groups began to show clinical signs 3 days after challenge. the liver of one animal that received CCHFv 1974 appeared normal at day 32 of the vaccination schedule. all other challenged animals in the spleen and liver showed lesions in both the spleen and liver. 0 0 Mild 2 0 0 0 Moderate 3 3 1 0 Marked 4 5 0 0 Numbers of animals in each group according to severity rating of histological lesions. more severe pathology was found in mice that received MVA 1974, compared to those that received MVA-GP. two animals vaccinated with MVA 1974 did not show clinical signs. in the spleen, the majority of positive cells appeared to be macrophages in the red pulp, with only scattered cells in the white pulp. in the spleen, the majority of positive cells appeared to be macrophages in the red pulp, with only scattered cells in the white pulp. the minimum lethal dose of CCHFv was 14 days after booster vaccination. sections of spleen (A, D) and liver (B\u2013C, E) were fixed, immunohistochemically stained with CCHFv-specific antibody. a diffuse staining pattern of viral proteins was found in tissues from animals that received the MVA 1974 negative control. at day 42, viral RNA was detected in the blood of only 1 out of 5 vaccinated mice. there was no statistically significant difference between day 32 and day 42 samples from vaccinated animals. MVA vaccines are currently in clinical trials up to phase III for diseases including tuberculosis, malaria, HIV-AIDS, cancer, influenza, and Hepatitis C [41]\u2013[47]. the CCHF glycoprotein precursor undergoes co- and post-translational proteolytic cleavage events in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi body. GN encoded non-structural accessory domains (mucin like domain, GP38 and NSm), as well as GN and GC. this is similar to a candidate DNA vaccine described by Spik et al [19] but in contrast to an oral vaccine that expressed GN and GC only [20] there is a complex interplay between the products of the glycoprotein precursor. similar studies with other tick-borne pathogens have modelled infection and disease using the intradermal route to experimentally mimic tick bite. the time to onset of clinical signs were consistent with those seen by Zivcec et al [11] with a challenge dose of 100 TCID50 delivered subcutaneously. the lethal dose observed by that group was 0.05 TCID50, compared to >10 TCID50 in the present study. CCHF induces proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, but these are incapable of controlling infection in fatal cases. peptides used in the ELISPOT assay were 20 amino acid residues in length. a positive T-cell response was only seen in the group that survived lethal challenge. monoclonal antibodies, raised against viral glycoproteins, identified protective epitopes in both GN and GC. but only antibodies recognising epitopes in GC were neutralising in vitro. antibody recognition of similar CCHFv glycoproteins in both the wild-type 129Sv/Ev and A129 mouse strains. recombinant GN ectodomain was used as the capture antigen. a direct correlation could not be drawn between induction of CCHFv-specific antibodies. at 4 days post-challenge, randomly selected animals were sacrificed for viral load analysis. viraemia assessed by RT-PCR has also been observed in convalescent patients. the vaccine induced comprehensive cellular and humoral immunity to CCHFv. protection correlated with T-cell responses, but not antibody induction. further directions for this work could include testing the longevity of demonstrated protective effects."}
