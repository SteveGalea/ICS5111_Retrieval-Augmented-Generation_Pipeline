{"summary": "tubuloreticular inclusions are 20- to 28-nm subcellular structures made of phospholipids. they appear as anastomosing membranous tubules in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum on electron microscopy (EM) TRIs have been strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) turia's complete blood count revealed anemia with hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.4\u20139.9 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.8 103/mm3, and normal platelet count. his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Cr were 116 and 5.7 mg/dL. a kidney biopsy was performed at the time of hemodialysis catheter placement. extensive global glomerulosclerosis was seen by LM. fourteen glomeruli had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) he had chronic respiratory failure with a history of multiple aspiration pneumonias, hypothyroidism, chronic diarrhea, and frequent urinary tract infections. he had a history of multiple aspiration pneumonias, hypothyroidism, chronic diarrhea, and frequent urinary tract infections. direct IF showed diffuse, global, granular, glomerular capillary wall-positive staining by IgG (4+), IgA (3+), C1q (1+), and C3 (2+). EM showed extensive podocyte foot process effacement, numerous subepithelial electron-dense deposits (arrows; original magnification 3,000) and a tubuloreticular inclusion (arrow) within cytoplasm of an endothelial cell (original magnification 1 oliguric renal failure with concern for sepsis. she required hemodialysis and plasma transfusions for worsening bilateral pneumonia. her renal function improved and the hemodialysis catheter was removed. LM showed 35 unremarkable glomeruli. interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were seen. a moderate infiltrate of mononuclear leukocytes diffusely present. his weight and height were below the 5th centile for age. he had facial swelling, ascites, and significant pitting edema on his lower extremities. the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. ANA Negative Negative Negative C3 and C4 Low C3, normal C4 Normal C3 & C4 Normal C3 & C4 TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; EBV, Epstein-bar virus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; ANA, antinuclear antibodies; C4, complement 4. a kidney biopsy was performed at the time of hemodialysis catheter placement the second case was a Hispanic male who presented at 6 months of age with nephrotic syndrome. he had bilateral cataracts, hypotonia, palate deformity, developmental delay, failure to thrive with gastric tube dependency, and seizures. he had chronic respiratory failure with a history of multiple aspiration pneumonias, hypothyroidism, chronic diarrhea, and frequent urinary tract infections. a kidney biopsy was performed and evaluated by LM, IF, and EM. LM revealed mild mesangial hypercellularity and focal mild endocapillary hypercellularity. two months prior to our evaluation, she had been hospitalized for acute renal failure requiring dialysis while visiting India. she required hemodialysis for 2 weeks after which her renal function improved and the hemodialysis catheter was removed. kalemia (6 mEq/L) and hyperphosphatemia (6.6 mg/dL) were normal. ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies were negative. LM showed 35 unremarkable glomeruli. the presence of TRIs in renal biopsies of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy has been shown to indicate the existence of underlying autoimmune or viral etiology. TRIs have been historically associated with SLE and HIV infection since the late 20th century. the pathogenesis of HIVAN remains unclear. there is recent evidence for direct infection of the renal epithelial cells as the underlying etiology. the presence of TRIs in renal biopsies of children without underlying autoimmune or viral etiologies remains obscure. we propose a possible role for excess IFN triggered by an exaggerated immune response to common viral infections."}
