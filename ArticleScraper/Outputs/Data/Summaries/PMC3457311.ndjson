{"summary": "influenza viruses are negative-sense, single-stranded RNA members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, with influenza A and B viruses causing significant clinical disease each year. vaccination remains our best medical intervention at preventing influenza virus-related illness and death that occur during seasonal epidemics (47) the virus still causes severe morbidity and mortality in this age group. nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A and B viruses antagonizes the host interferon response following infection. it has been shown that viruses with partial deletions in NS1 protein are attenuated and do not cause disease. it remains unknown if this vaccine strategy can confer enhanced protection to aged mice. recombinant viruses expressed either full-length NS1 protein (wild-type [WT] PR8) or the first 126 amino acids (NS1-126) following rescue, virus stocks were grown in 10-day-old eggs and then passaged in 10-day-old eggs. mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml of ketamine-xylazine. aged mice were anesthetized with 0.075 ml ketamine-xylazine. animals were euthanized if they lost 25% of their initial body weight. mice were challenged with 2,400 PFU of WT PR8 virus. mice were vaccinated and challenged as described above. mice were euthanized and lung tissues were harvested. all RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cDNA samples was performed using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems) on a Mastercycler EP Realplex (Eppendorf) values represent fold change over mock-infected samples. e IgG (-chain specific; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) substrate (Zymed) was added. a sample was considered negative if HI activity is not seen with a 1:10 dilution of the serum. data were acquired on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems) data were analyzed using a one-tailed Student's t test (Prism4, GraphPad) welch's correction was used if variances were statistically different. ELISAs were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Virus stocks were grown in 10-day-old chicken eggs and the allantoic fluid was harvested 72 h later. the allantoic fluid was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm. mice were anesthetized with 0.075 ml ketamine-xylazine (0.203 mg ketamine and 0.060 mg xylazine) for all experiments involving viral infections, animals were euthanized if they lost 25% of their initial body weight. young and aged mice were inoculated with 10 PFU of WT PR8 virus. mice were vaccinated and challenged as described above. lungs were mechanically homogenized by plaque assay. mice were euthanized and lung tissues were harvested. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 50 l of 5 g/ml purified PR8 virus or 2 g/ml baculovirus-expressed hemagglutination (HA) from A/California/04/2009. plates were then blocked with 1% BSA-PBS and then washed with PBS and 0.025% Tween. mice were euthanized and single cell suspensions from whole lungs stained with rat anti-mouse CD8a (53-6.7), rat anti-mouse CD3e (145-2C11) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) tetramers. in order to assess influenza virus specific CD8 T cell activation, MHC-I tetramer NP147 was used. kinetics were similar in young and aged mice at this time point. mice were infected with 10 PFU of WT PR8 virus and monitored for morbidity and mortality. mice were infected with 10 PFU of virus and monitored for morbidity. aged mice display altered cellular and humoral immune responses following infection with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus. aged mice (n = 3) displayed statistically lower CD8 T cell percentages in the lung compared to young mice (n = 3). ELISA data are representative of two independent experiments. young and aged mice were infected with various doses of NS1-126 virus. at all doses tested, NS1-126 was attenuated in young and aged mice. animals did not display any signs of infection and were spared from weight loss during the 2-week monitoring period. young and aged mice were completely protected from lethal challenge. young mice were inoculated with 103 PFU of NS1-126 virus. aged mice were vaccinated with 102 or 103 (n = 5) PFU of NS1-126 virus. mice, PBS versus 102 PFU, P = 0.0035, and PBS versus 103 PFU, P = 0.0035. aged mice, PBS versus 102 PFU, P = 0.32, and PBS versus 103 PFU, P = 0.0006. four days after challenge, animals were sacrificed and lung tissues were harvested. at the protective dose for aged mice (103 PFU), virus was only detected at low levels in the lungs of one out of three mice postchallenge. no virus was detected in the lungs of young mice that were vaccinated with this dose. aged mice mount protective immunological response following NS1-126 vaccination. young animals are depicted in green, while aged animals are depicted in blue. three weeks postvaccination, animals were infected with 100 LD50 of WT PR8 virus. lungs were harvested for MHC-I tetramer staining on day 5. mice vaccinated with 10 times the vaccine dose known to protect a young mouse. aged mice that received either 4 or 10 times the vaccine dose were unprotected and succumbed to infection within the first days of infection. this was unexpected as young and aged mice had comparable antibody titers assessed by ELISA. aged mice display deficits in cellular and humoral immunity following influenza virus infection. young (6 to 8 weeks) and aged (18 months) mice were intranasally inoculated with 10 PFU of WT PR8 virus. weight changes only statistically different on day 14. aged mice had lower total cell numbers and percentages of CD8 T cells specific for influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) development of humoral immunity was also compromised in aged mice. aged mice display altered cellular and humoral immune responses following infection with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus. NS1-126 viruses serve as safe and effective vaccines in young mice. NS1-126 viruses were rescued, sequenced to confirm NS1 deletion, and inoculated onto an MDCK monolayer culture to assess attenuation in an IFN-competent system. young and aged mice were infected with 10, 102, or 103 PFU of NS1-126 virus. an additional group of aged mice was inoculated with 104 PFU of the NS1-126 virus. three weeks postvaccination, animals were challenged with 100 LD50 of WT PR8 virus. young animals are depicted in green, while aged animals are depicted in blue. data are representative of two independent experiments. a reduction in viral titers was seen in both young and old mice. at the protective dose for aged mice (103 PFU), virus was only detected at low levels in the lungs of one out of three mice postchallenge. antibody titers were barely above background in aged mice that were vaccinated with 102 or 103 PFU or mock vaccinated with 102 or 103 PFU. young and aged mice were inoculated with 102 or 103 PFU or mock vaccinated with 102 or 103 PFU. young and aged mice were inoculated with 102 or 103 PFU. tetramer analysis showed no significant difference between CD8+ T cell number and frequency in young mice compared to aged mice. high-dose inactivated vaccine administration does not protect aged mice from lethal challenge. aged mice were vaccinated with 200 ng (4 dose; n = 5) and 500 ng (10 dose; n = 5) three weeks postvaccination, animals were challenged with 100 LD50 of mouse-adapted A/Netherlands/602/2009 virus. the model is of great value to study of virus pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. aged mice that were vaccinated with 103 PFU of the NS1-126 vaccine were completely protected from lethal challenge. a single administration of a live virus vaccine has been shown to be immunogenic in aged mice. however, viral titers may not be accurate predictor of survival. the lung titer of one aged mouse vaccinated with 102 PFU NS1-126 on day 4 was at or below the limit of detection of the assay. it is possible that lung titers would be higher if assessed at later time points. young and aged mice responded similarly to infection following a sublethal inoculation, though aged mice recovered more slowly from infection. titers and CD8 T cell activation in the lung to levels comparable to what was seen in young mice. despite its less attenuated nature compared to PR8 viruses with shorter NS1 segments, the NS1-126 virus vaccine was still safe in aged mice. a high-dose version of the trivalent inactivated vaccine was FDA approved for use in the elderly starting in 2010. it is interesting to note that higher doses of inactivated vaccines did not provide protection from homologous challenge in the aged mouse model. this suggests that these antibodies might not be as potent as those produced following vaccination with NS1-126 virus."}
