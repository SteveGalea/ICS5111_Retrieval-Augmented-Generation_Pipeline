{"summary": "in 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus involved 26 countries and 8098 patients. thereafter, SARS has re-emerged sporadically in both laboratory and community settings. the whole topic has also been reviewed elsewhere. Associated lung damage is believed to be the result of a virally-triggered inflammatory reaction mediated by a host of cytokines 14,15. peak radiographic changes occurred at 8.6 days after fever onset, with 17.4% showing two peaks at 6.3 and 13.5 days. antiviral therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should always be administered before laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection. if respiratory failure sets in, oxygen supplementation, assisted ventilation and intensive supportive treatments will be required. higher doses given intravenously resulted in more frequent and severe adverse effects including haemolytic anaemia, elevated transaminase levels and bradycardia 13. Lopinavir-ritonavir co-formulation (Kaletra\u00ae, Abbott Laboratories, USA) is a protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. interferon has been used for SARS treatment in china and canada 28,29,30. in vitro testing showed that interferon was more potent than interferon or, being effective even when administered after SARS-CoV infection in cell culture 31. traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used concomitantly with other drugs to treat SARS in mainland China. in one-third to half of critically ill SARS patients, fever may recur while on immunomodulatory treatment due to superimposed infections, too rapid tailing of corticosteroids or persistently severe and uninhibited cytokine storm. most patients can be presumed to be suffering from a severe recrudescence of the illness. methylprednisolone and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4g/kg) daily for three consecutive days in 15 probable SARS patients with acute lung injury (ARDS) had resulted in lower mortality and a trend towards earlier recovery 39. convalescent plasma collected from recovered SARS patients has been used in Hong Kong to treat severely ill patients not responding to corticosteroids. higher doses given intravenously resulted in more frequent and severe adverse effects including haemolytic anaemia, elevated transaminase levels and bradycardia 13. Lopinavir-ritonavir co-formulation (Kaletra\u00ae, Abbott Laboratories, USA) is a protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. it can inhibit the coronaviral proteases, thus blocking the processing of nine patients treated with corticosteroids plus interferon alfacon-1 showed better oxygen saturation, faster radiographic resolution and lesser need for supplemental oxygen compared to 13 given corticosteroids alone. traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used concomitantly with other drugs to treat SARS in mainland China. but its value in critically ill patients has not been reported. in one-third to half of critically ill SARS patients, fever may recur while on immunomodulatory treatment due to superimposed infections, too rapid tailing of corticosteroids or persistently severe and uninhibited cytokine storm. most patients can be presumed to be suffering from a severe recrudescence of the illness. convalescent plasma collected from 15 probable SARS patients has been used in Hong Kong to treat severely ill patients not responding to corticosteroids. some clinical benefits were reportedly observed in a small number of patients 40. at least 50% of patients would still develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIV is indicated in the presence of ALI and early ARDS when oxygen saturation (SpO2) could not improve to more than 93%. persistent tachypnoea of at least 30 breaths per minute; and progressive radiographic deterioration in the lungs 43. the usual contraindications to NIV apply, including impaired consciousness, uncooperative patient, high aspiration risk, and haemodynamic instability 35. prone positioning 64,47, high frequency oscillatory ventilation 64,47, nitric oxide 47, nitric oxide 47, high PEEP and regular lung recruitment 64. tracheostomy is required in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. CPAP of 4-10 cm H2O, or bi-level pressure support with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 10 cm H2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 4-6 cm H2O are reasonable starting pressures 43. higher pressures should be avoided whenever possible, because it may increase the risk of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. acute renal failure, acute liver failure, rhadomyolysis, cardiovascular dysfunction, or prolonged immobilization and co-morbidities, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, ischaemic strokes, etc. are common complications that are potentially aggravated by noninvasive ventilation 5. a standard treatment protocol was eventually applied to 88 consecutively admitted SARS patients 56. the protocol included initially high (but not pulsed) dose methylprednisolone with tapering over three weeks 11. this protocol was eventually applied to 88 consecutively admitted SARS patients 56. all three deaths occurring in patients over the age of 65 years. asopharyngeal aspirates negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, PCR-positive ones are more likely to require ICU care and mechanical ventilation, develop acute renal failure and die 60. older age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression were associated with poor ICU outcome 65. endotracheal intubation should be considered earlier and in anticipation of impending deterioration. operator must be familiar with its mode of operation and precautions required for gowning and degowning, and must be assisted by a colleague with similar knowledge. randomized-controlled trials are required for confirmation. if not all, knowledge about clinical aspects of SARS are based on retrospective observational data. randomized-controlled trials are required for confirmation. a viral/bacterial filter should be placed at the expiratory port of bag-valve mask Place two filters per ventilator: between expiratory port and the ventilator, and another on the exhalation outlet of the ventilator."}
