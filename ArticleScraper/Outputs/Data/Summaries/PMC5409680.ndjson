{"summary": "asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, associated with airway constriction, inflammation, bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR), as well as respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, dyspnoea and chest tightness. the prevalence of asthma will grow by more than 100 million by 2025. studies have shown that diets with low average consumption of fruit and vegetables play a major role in the development of allergic diseases. antioxidants present in fruit and vegetables can scavenge ROS, and thus inhibit NFB-mediated inflammation. dietary antioxidants present in fruit and vegetables can scavenge ROS, and thus inhibit NFB-mediated inflammation. ezing and immune responses (including immune responses to virus infection and inflammation) in asthma and wheezing. additional studies were identified by hand searching references. articles considered not relevant based on title were coded NR (not retrieve) with the reason noted. further assessments of the retrieved articles were according to the abstract, keywords and MeSH terms. meta-analysis was performed for the total number of adults and children together, and pregnant women. analysis was performed using random effect modelling if I2 > 50 and p 0.1. tool for asthma Diagnosis Dietary Assessment Methods Variables Contrasted Outcomes Cook et al.

[42] reported that fruit and vegetable intake was inversely associated with bronchial asthma. sputum neutrophils % increased (p 0.05) following the diet. treatment with tomato juice and tomato extract reduced airway neutrophils and sputum neutrophil elastase. twelve studies [17,20,37,40,44,46,47,48,51,61,64,68] found mixed results. one cohort study [41] assessed the intake of cooked vegetables, salads, tomatoes, fresh fruit, citrus fruit and kiwi. a study by Chatzi et al. [37] showed that consumption of vegetables more than eight times per week was inversely correlated with persistent wheeze. no association was found regarding maternal fruit or vegetable intake and wheeze in the offspring. cross-sectional studies found an inverse association between vegetable consumption and asthma-related symptoms. a recent study reported fruit intake was inversely related to odds of asthma. no association was found between vegetable intake and asthma in adolescents. a one-year trial by Fogarty et al. [24] conducted in asthmatic children found no difference in prevalence of wheezing, exercise-induced wheeze, or nocturnal cough between children who were instructed to add an extra piece of fruit to their diet compared to the control group. meta-analyses of 17 primary prevention studies revealed no significant association between fruit intake and risk of prevalent asthma. intake with the severity of wheeze was not possible as there was only one secondary prevention study. no meta-analysis was possible for immune markers as well as respiratory infection, due to lack of available studies. 496,741 participants included from cross-sectional studies, 2139 cases and 2739 controls from case-control studies. in total, 7109 participants were included in clinical trials with a mean intervention period of 141 days ranging from 3 to 365 days. 10 adults diagnosed with stable asthma Mean age of 63 No control group The LAO diet b 14 days Doctor-diagnosed asthma and respiratory symptoms The LAO diet: genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses including the innate immune receptors TLR2, IL1R2, CD93, ANTXR2 and neutrophil proteases. 104 children with childhood asthma criteria for at least 1 year 1\u20135 No control group Dietary re-education by a nutritional education programme named \u201cLearning to Eat from the Mediterranean\u201d 1 year Doctor-diagnosed asthma The use of ICS a Abbreviation: FENO, fractional exhaled nitric oxide; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s. eight studies [23,30,31,32,52,57,58,67] reported mixed results. most of the studies measured total fruit and vegetable intake. one cross-sectional study examined only vegetable intake [42], three cohort studies assessed only fresh fruit intake [22,59], and one study analysed the consumption of orange, apple, grapefruit, onion, white cabbage, berries, and juices. barros et al. [67] found no significant associations between fruit and vegetable intake and exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in adults. study also found that treatment with tomato juice and tomato extract reduced airway neutrophils and sputum neutrophil elastase activity. no cohort studies in adults reported associations between fruit and vegetable intake and immune function in asthma. cross-sectional study by La vecchia et al. [42] reported that vegetable consumption was inversely associated with bronchial asthma. study found subjects on a LAO diet were 2.26 times as likely to have an asthma exacerbation at any time. no improvements in airway and systemic inflammation, lung function and asthma control after tomato extract supplementation. al studies assessed the consumption of fruit only [1,27,43,64] or citrus fruit plus vegetables [7] one cohort study [41] assessed the intake of cooked vegetables, salads, tomatoes, fresh fruit, citrus fruit and kiwi. one birth cohort study [53] measured food-based antioxidant intake. a study by Romieu et al. found that regular consumption of fruit in the last month was associated with lower risk of having persistent asthma. the fruit and vegetable index (FVI) was positively related to FEV1 and FVC. a 1-point increase in FVI was associated with a 105 mL increase in FVC. fruit intake was associated with a low prevalence of current wheeze in affluent and non-affluent countries. 192 children with asthma received fruit and vegetable capsules + fish oil + probiotic vs. placebo. the proportion of children using inhaled glucocorticoids decreased following the supplementation. over the last 12 months was inversely associated with current asthma at 18 years. no significant association was observed between cooked vegetable intake and asthma symptoms. no association was observed between fruit and vegetable intake. for each one-unit increase in FVI there was a significant decrease in IL-8 levels in nasal lavage. for each one-unit increase in FVC there was a significant decrease in IL-8 levels in nasal lavage. increased vegetable consumption is negatively associated with serum IL-17F. 104 children aged 1\u20135 years with current asthma participated in a nutritional education programme based on the traditional Mediterranean diet for one year. fruit and vegetable intake increased significantly with a concomitant decrease in inhaled glucocorticoids use. fruit intake was also negatively associated with risk of prevalent wheeze. no relationship was found between vegetable intake and risk of prevalent wheeze. systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of prevalent asthma. twenty studies (n = 8 in adults and n = 12 in children) reported mixed results. eight studies (n = 1 in adults and n = 7 in children) failed to show any beneficial effects of fruit and vegetable intakes on risk of asthma and wheeze. vitamin C is a major antioxidant in the extracellular respiratory lining fluid. it protects immune cells from oxidative stress and may also contribute to lung growth and development. vitamin E can be found in various fruits and vegetables, including corn, tomato, spinach, broccoli, kiwifruit, and mango. studies reported lower rates of wheezing and allergic rhinitis in children who consumed antioxidant-rich foods daily [36,48,78] high antioxidant intake is related to enhanced pulmonary function and reduced chronic respiratory symptoms in children. studies also suggest that antioxidants might affect immune function and allergic reactions. only one intervention study in children has examined effects of fruit on inflammation. a banana or a banana and apple for one month resulted in a statistically significant 18% reduction in FENO levels in adults with asthma. two intervention studies have examined the effect of withdrawal of antioxidant-rich foods, on immune responses in adults with asthma. all negative associations between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma were no longer significant when children with food-related allergic symptoms were excluded. however, most of the included studies were adjusted for important lifestyle factors, such as smoking and/or physical activity status. some studies investigated the association between intake of a specific type of fruit and/or vegetable and asthma. however, only studies that reported total fruit and/or total vegetable intake were included and assessed in the meta-analysis. some studies investigated diet as a risk factor for asthma (primary prevention) ethnicity/race as well as well-designed intervention trials warranted to accurately address effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of asthma development. more evidence is also needed from laboratory studies to identify the biological mechanisms responsible for the effects of fruit and vegetable intake on the development and management of asthma."}
