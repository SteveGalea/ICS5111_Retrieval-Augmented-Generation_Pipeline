{"summary": "the group of cytokines known as interferons (IFN) plays a major role in the cell immunity by inducing a cascade of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode for several antiviral innate immune effectors. the group of proteins is present across a wide range of species: from amphibians, fish and birds to mammals. IFITMs do not inhibit the entry process of mouse leukemia virus (MLV), Machupo virus (MACH), Lassa virus (LASV) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). only IFITM1 has been recently described to inhibit Rana grylio virus (RGV), a frog/fish iridovirus, at the entry stage [8] we previously reported that ASFV enters into the host cell by dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis [12, 17]. we previously reported that ASFV enters into the host cell by dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. lipofectamine 2000 (Life technologies) was pretreated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) plates were previously pretreated with poly-L-lysine at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml to avoid cell detachment. supernatants containing the pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were collected twice at 48 h and 72 h postransfection. cells were stained with serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) or normal goat serum (Sigma) cells were stained with primary and secondary antibodies and then incubated with topro-3 (Molecular Probes) in PBS at a 1:1,000 ratio for DNA staining. Western Blotting Cells were harvested in Sample Buffer Laemmli 2X concentrate (Sigma) the samples were incubated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and resolved by SDS-PAGE in 12% or 7% polyacrylamide-bisacrylamide gels. the non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked with skimmed milk diluted in PBS. quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using specific oligonucleotides and a premix exTaq (TM) (2X; Takara) probe. DNA from cells mock-infected with ASFV Ba71V at MOI of 1 pfu/cell was extracted at 16 hpi and purified with a DNAeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) stable cell lines vero-IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3 or control cells containing the empty vector were infected at MOI of 10 pfu/cell. infection was allowed to proceed for 75 minutes at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. cells were then washed with cold PBS 1X and treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for 10 minutes to remove the membrane-bound virus. vero cells infected with Ba71V at 6 hpi or 16 hpi were harvested by trypsinization, washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized with Perm2 (BD science) for 10 min at RT and then incubated with specific primary antibodies against p30 and p72 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the obtained infection rates were always normalized to the corresponding control. a recombinant virus expressing the viral protein p54 fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used for flow cytometry analyses. the adsorption phase took place at 4\u00b0C to allow viral attachment to the cell surface but impeding its internalization. lentiviruses expressing the gene of interest were supplemented with 1 g/ml of polybrene (EMD Millipore) 24 h later, transduced cells were selected by adding 8 g/ml of puromycin (Life Technologies) Optimal puromycin working concentration was previously titrated in non-transduced cells. antibodies used for western blotting included rabbit polyclonal to IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 (Proteintech), 1:200. anti-ASFV mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-p72 (clone 1BC11 for immunofluorescence 1:1,000 or clone 18BG3 for WB 1:2,000) anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. band densitometry was performed with a Chemidoc XRSplus Imaging System (Bio-Rad) negative amplification controls included DNA purified from ASFV purified virions at different concentrations as standards. each sample was included in triplicates and values were normalized to standard positive controls. decapsidated virions were single labeled for p72 and p150. staining was normalized to the total number of fully encapsidated virions. values were expressed in graph bars as mean SD of at least three independent experiments unless otherwise noted. results IFN treatment abrogates ASFV infection. IFITM1 and IFITM2 were induced by IFN in both cell lines. expression of IFITM proteins was induced in vero and 293T cells. expression of IFITM proteins was induced by IFN in both cell lines. Statistical significance was evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison test. differences are marked with asterisks as indicated (***p0.001). IFITM1 was mainly distributed at the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent in perinuclear compartments. endogenous IFITM1 was barely detected in vero cells containing the empty vector. overexpression led to a high accumulation of the protein in the perinuclear region. expression of IFITM2 (green) was analyzed in vero-IFITM2 cells and vero cells containing the empty vector. expression of IFITM2 (green) was analyzed by confocal microcopy. a total of 30 cells were analyzed for each condition. endosomes were predominantly dispersed in the cytoplasm of cells containing the empty vector or concentrated to the perinuclear area in Vero-IFITM2 and 3 cells. the change in distribution was quantified by measuring the mean distance to the nucleus of the different endosomal markers in x, y and z planes. escence assay revealed a clear colocalization of IFITMs and CD63 in vero-IFITM cells. IFITM2 and to a lesser extent IFITM1 and 3 were located primarily in endosomal compartments as indicated by higher colocalization with endosomal marker CD63. a conserved endosomal cholesterol efflux is required for a correct endosomal function. a conserved endosomal cholesterol efflux is required for a correct endosomal function. we analyzed intracellular and intra-endosomal cholesterol levels by using the cholesterol marker filipin. inhibition of acidification impaired viral decapsidation and viral particles were retained in late endosomes, thus blocking viral infection progression. previous experiments in the laboratory revealed that the inhibition of acidification impaired viral decapsidation and viral particles were retained in Rab7-positive late endosomes. dated viral particles were counted and the ratio of decapsidated viral cores compared to the total number of virions per individual cell was calculated and expressed in percentages. the percentage of decapsidated virus severely decreased under IFITM2 expression. however, IFITM3 expression produced an accumulation of virions leading to higher numbers of total virions. this increase might be the result of an impaired progression of the ASFV replication cycle. FITM3 or empty control cells related to total number of virions counted from a total of N = 15 cells per condition. we analyzed the impact of IFITM expression on other infection parameters to find reduced number of copies of ASFV genome at 16 hpi. Statistical significance was evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison test. differences are marked with asterisks as indicated (***p0.001). IFITM proteins are located in different cellular compartments. their antiviral properties strongly correlate with their capacity to alter the fluidity and fusion ability of the membranes in which they reside [23, 24]. the highest expression levels within the IFITM family correspond to IFITM3, followed by IFITM2 and IFITM1. the highest expression levels within the IFITM family members correspond to IFITM3, followed by IFITM2 and IFITM1. IFITM1 was mainly distributed at the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent in perinuclear compartments. endogenous IFITM1 was barely detected in vero cells containing the empty vector. overexpression led to a high accumulation of the protein in the perinuclear region, colocalizing with vesicular structures. expression of IFITM2 (green) was analyzed in vero-IFITM2 cells and vero cells containing the empty vector. a total of 30 cells were analyzed for each condition. a total of 30 cells were analyzed for each condition. endosomes were predominantly dispersed in the cytoplasm of cells containing the empty vector or concentrated to the perinuclear area in vero-IFITM2 and 3 cells. the change in distribution was quantified by measuring the mean distance to the nucleus of the different endosomal markers in x, y and z planes. graphs depict meanSD of N = 30 cells per condition. IFITM2, and to a lesser extent IFITM1 and 3 were located primarily in endosomal compartments as indicated by higher colocalization with endosomal marker CD63. expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins (green) and CD63-positive late endosomes (red) in cells containing the empty vector. a conserved endosomal cholesterol efflux is required for a correct endosomal function. we analyzed intracellular and intra-endosomal cholesterol levels by using the cholesterol marker filipin (red) in vero-IFITM1 cells, only discrete colocalization areas between IFITM1 and cholesterol were found at the plasma membrane. capsidation and viral particles were retained in Rab7-positive late endosomes, thus blocking viral infection progression. acidic pH of late endosomal compartments is required for viral decapsidation. the viral capsid is formed by major capsid protein p72 organized in capsomers. the percentage of decapsidated virus severely decreased under IFITM2 expression. however, IFITM3 expression produced an accumulation of virions leading to higher numbers of total virions. this increase in the number of total virions might be the result of an impaired progression of the ASFV replication cycle. IFITM overexpression induced a consistent reduction in infectivity. the expression of protein p30 at 6 hpi and p72 at 16 hpi resulted significantly reduced as other infection parameters. different IFITM proteins have been described as inhibitors of a broad spectrum of RNA viruses [6], their antiviral role involving DNA viruses is poorly studied and only reported in the Rana grylio virus (RGV) sensitivity towards the induction of the innate immune response of the host cell has led viruses to acquire different strategies to regulate the IFN pathway for its own benefit. overexpression of IFITM1 has been described to delay proteolytic degradation of human papilloma virus capsids in keratinocytes. this suggests a possible role for IFITM2 in inhibiting ASFV exit from late endosomes. this suggests a possible role for IFITM2 in inhibiting ASFV exit from late endosomes. IFITM2 and IFITM3-mediated inhibition of ASFV entry has been previously reported in other viruses, including IAV, flaviviruses (DENV and WNV) [6], filoviruses (MARV and EBOV) and coronaviruses (such as SARS) [34]. infection with alphaviruses, arenaviruses and MLV seems to be unaffected by IFITM protein expression. cholesterol in the endosomal membrane and membrane fusion defects [38] disturbing intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. accumulation of cholesterol upon overexpression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 leads to cholesterol accumulation. inhibition of cholesterol exit from endosomes using chemical inhibitors causes retention of virions inside these vesicles."}
