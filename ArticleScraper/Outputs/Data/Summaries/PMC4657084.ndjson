{"summary": "alphavirus nsP2 protease enzyme has been defined as a papain-like cysteine protease16,22,23,24,25. it appears that the nsP2 was a cysteine-histidine dyad protease similar to papain. the papain protease has been used as a model for which structure was available for several decades. the upper panel shows superposition of the 3 currently available alphavirus nsP2 protease active sites. the lower panel shows the active site of papain (PDB ID: 9PAP) Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package. the CHIKV nsP2 protease (truncated and full length) could recognize small peptide substrates, which has not been reported for Sindbis virus or Semliki forest virus (SFV) nsP2 protease. the substrates employed in the present study are the biological cleavage site sequences of the CHIKV protease with FRET tags. nsP2 has been characterized as papain-like. there have been few studies to characterize the kinetic mechanism for the nsP2 protease. this is unfortunate as now available structures and the data in this report demonstrate that alphavirus nsP2 is not papain-like. tryptophan position mutants replaced tryptophan residue with alanine and phenylalanine. kinetic parameters obtained for the 2 mutants show differences for the two engineered proteins for the 3 substrates. UCSF Chimera is developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco. the kinetic parameters for nsP2 pro Wild Type and mutants were determined. the kinetic results are represented as mean S.D. for at least 3 independent experiments. we used several protease inhibitors as well as metal salts to characterize the nsP2 enzymes. zinc interactions allowed tryptophan residue mutants to retain greater activity for all 3 substrates. nsP2 pro AGA AGC AGG Leupeptin Wild Type 91.25 2.58 100.2 10.2 106.2 9.7 Cys478Ala 98.86 8.11 102.5 10.7 105.5 7.0 Ser482Ala 96.85 5.39 98.42 16.22 99.97 8.02 Trp549Ala 95.37 11.19 93.77 6.50 81.29 3.97 83.72 2.54 80.79 14.51 PMSF Wild Type 107.7 4.3 93.07 4.26 71.30 6.67 Cys478Ala 113.89 63.3 70.82 14.22 50.87 28.14 Ser482Ala 102.8 8.3 87.56 28.71 88.37 6.57 Trp549Ala 95.24 4.27 100.32 7.86 91.34 8.85 Trp549Phe 100 68.68 4.85 Trp549Phe 81.46 12.00 25.93 1.97 60.33 7.26 Cobalt Wild Type 200.0 11.2 59.63 0.75 119.3 9.7 Cys478Ala 313.8 52.5 55.63 8.71 114.0 47.2 Ser482Ala 103.1 2.8 52.70 3.06 123.1 22.4 Trp549Ala 161.98 7.12 34.44 11.43 140.67 20.07 Trp549P nd indicates activity could not be detected, that is, complete inhibition. the modest effects of the tryptophan residue mutations on the kinetic parameters support the idea that the residue position does not play a direct role in catalysis. both single mutation enzymes, Cys478Ala and Ser482Ala, had activity for all three substrates. however, both enzymes had significantly less activity than wild type for the AGA substrate. this suggests that other residues are significantly involved in the binding and catalysis. atin showed mild inhibition of the wild type for all 3 substrates. but for wild type, Cys478Ala and Ser482Ala enzymes the inhibition appeared substrate dependent with even a slight enhancement for ser482Ala activity with AGA. the five metal salts studied gave varying effects depending on the metal, the substrate and the enzyme being considered. nsP2 pro wild type 50.36 1.89 Cys478Ala 53.17 8.82 Ser482Ala 50.43 1.71 Trp549Ala 52.86 8.6 Trp549Phe 53.97 4.2 The percent remaining activity of each enzyme after incubation at 42 \u00b0C was used as a control. several reports show viral protease enzyme activity is affected by metal ions8,19,26,41,44,46. the mechanism is unclear at this time but may be due to the metal interaction with the protein\u2019s amino acid residues. cobalt significantly increases activity for AGA substrate for the wild type and Cys478Ala but not Ser482Ala. characterization of other alphavirus nsP2\u2019s with a similar serine \u2013cysteine arrangement (for example SFV nsP2) needs to be performed. further characterization studies will be necessary if the nsP2 protease will be an anti-viral target. substrate sequences of chikungunya virus nsP2 protease used in this study were synthesized corresponding to scissile site sequences of chikungunya virus non-structural polyprotein (nsP1/2, nsP2/3 and nsP3/4). oyl fluorophore group was attached at the amino terminus and a 2,4- dinitrophenyl (Dnp) group attached to the carboxyl terminus of an additional lysine (K) residue. a single concentration of 2 mM metal ion was employed to test cobalt (Co2+), magnesium (Mg2+), zinc (Zn2+), nickel (Ni2+) and copper (Cu2+) effects on protea the engineered mutants were expressed and purified by the same protocol as the wild type protein. characterization was performed with 3 synthetic fluorescent substrates corresponding to the cleavage sites of the chikungunya viral non-structural polyprotein. substrate sequences of chikungunya virus nsP2 protease were synthesized. a 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl (Nma) fluorophore group was attached at the amino terminus and a 2,4- dinitrophenyl (Dnp) group attached to the carboxyl terminus of an additional lysine (K) residue. mM metal ion was employed to test cobalt (Co2+), magnesium (Mg2+), zinc (Zn2+), nickel (Ni2+) and copper (Cu2+) effects on protease activity. different final concentrations of four protease inhibitors were used."}
