{"summary": "LAB offer several advantages over current systemic vaccination routes. several strains may act as natural adjuvants, potentially eliminating the use of toxic adjuvants common in systemic vaccines. p gene encodes uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) this enzyme belongs to the pyrimidine salvage pathway and creates UMP from uracil and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (15). 5-fluoro-UMP acts as a suicide inhibitor of the enzyme thymidylate synthase, which causes cell death. wild-type L. casei ATCC 393 was grown in MRS medium (Sigma) and plasmid-free recombinant L. casei ATCC 393 PPT upp was grown in SDM medium containing 100 g/ml of 5-FU (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C without shaking. plasmid pGBHCupp contained upp and chloramphenicol resistance genes. the pGBHCupp-2A2B temperature-sensitive vector was PCR amplified. the pGBHCupp-2A2B temperature-sensitive vector was digested with BglII (TaKaRa) and AscI (NEB) pMD18-T-2B plasmid digested with SacII (TaKaRa) and PacI (NEB) 2B was inserted into the pGBHCupp-2A2B-PPT site via the same restriction enzyme digestion and ligated to create the plasmid. the construct was named pUC57\u2013A1821. a 100-ml culture of L. casei ATCC 393 cells was grown in MRS medium at 37\u00b0C for 4.5 h. the cells were pelleted and washed in EPWB buffer two more times, washed in EPB buffer and then finally resuspended in 1 ml EPB buffer. single colonies were serially grown to stationary phase in antibiotic-free MRS medium three to five times in a 37\u00b0C water bath. the cultures were then serially inoculated three times into fresh antibiotic-free MRS medium and grown for 24 h in a 42\u00b0C water bath. dilutions of 1,000- to 10,000-fold were selected by plating on semidefined medium with glucose (4, 24) recombinant strains were screened by PCR and sequencing. growth and hereditary stability of recombinant L. casei strains. protein extracts (8 g/ml) were applied to 96-well plates overnight at 4\u00b0C. wild-type L. casei protein was used as a negative-control antigen. plates were washed three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was added to each microtube (1:1,000) samples were then washed three times with PBS, dyed with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, washed three times, resuspended in 200 l PBS, and smeared on a microscope slide the pGBWVE1 plasmid contained the pWV01 temperature-sensitive replicon. upp and Cm resistance genes were inserted into the pGBWVE1 plasmid. the plasmid contained the pWV01 temperature-sensitive replicon. the sense primer for homologous arm 2B was ACCTTAATTCTTTGGCATGTGTAAAA (PacI), and the antisense primer was TCCCCGCGGGGGGAAGCA (SacII) the two PCR fragments were gel purified and inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) sense primer of alpha-toxin gene was TACGTAATGTTCTGGGATCCTGATACAGA (HpaI), and antisense primer was GCTCTCTAGATTTTATAATTCTCTG (BglII) the PCR fragment was gel purified, inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and identified by sequencing. Approximately 500 ng of plasmid DNA (derived from E. coli TG1) was added to a 200-l aliquot of competent cells on ice. cells recovered in MRS overnight and were then plated on MRS medium containing 5 g/ml of Cm. cultures were serially inoculated three times into fresh antibiotic-free MRS medium and grown for 24 h in a 42\u00b0C water bath. recombinant strains were screened by PCR and sequencing. growth and hereditary stability of recombinant L. casei strains. integrated bacteria were grown overnight in recombinant bacteria. cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) pellets were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pBS) wild-type L. casei ATCC 393 and L. casei ATCC 393 PPT upp were grown overnight in MRS medium at 37\u00b0C. one milliliter of culture was collected by centrifugation at 1,700 g for 10 min. pMD18-T-2A was digested with AscI and BglII endonucleases. pMD18-T-2A, containing downstream homologous arm 2B, was digested with PacI and SacII. this construct was named pGBHCupp-2A2B. recombinant bacteria containing the pGBHCupp-2A2B-PPT temperature-sensitive plasmid were screened with temperature elevation and exposure to Cm. the recombinant bacteria contained a PPT expression cassette of 2,721 bp, the deleted upp gene of 651 bp, and 2,386 bp from wild-type L. casei. PCR analysis confirms that L. casei PPT upp is genetically stable after 40 generations. Lanes 3, PCR product of L. casei PPT upp 3 genomic DNA after 40 generations. lanes 5, PCR product of L. casei PPT upp 5 genomic DNA after 40 generations. their spacers are 4,456 bp in size. the OD490 for sample 3 was 0.6962 0.1145, that for sample 5 was 0.4935 0.0239, that for sample 12 was 0.5455 0.0318, and that for the negative control was 0.2468 0.0282. the differences between all groups were very significant (P 0.01). pMD18-T-2A was digested with AscI and BglII endonucleases. pMD18-T-2A, containing downstream homologous arm 2B, was digested with PacI and SacII. 2B was inserted into pGBHCupp-2A; this construct was named pGBHCupp-2A2B. PCR products were sequenced by Genewiz Biological Technology Company, Ltd., Beijing, China. BLAST results showed that the recombinant PCR product included the HCE promoter, a PgsA anchor, alpha-toxin, and the rrnB T1T2 terminator. the sequence is precisely the same as that of the expression cassette. casei PPT upp is genetically stable after 40 generations. Lanes 3, PCR product of L. casei PPT upp 3 genomic DNA after 40 generations. lanes 5, PCR product of L. casei PPT upp 5 genomic DNA after 40 generations. their spacers are 4,456 bp in size. the differences between all groups were very significant (P 0.01) these results suggested that the alpha-toxin protein was expressed and that the protein had biological activity. fusion protein localization was detected by laser confocal microscopy. all the cells were probed with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. systems containing two plasmids have been used for chromosomal integration in some bacteria (4, 25) one of the two plasmids must have a defect that prevents replication in strains lacking the repA gene. two-plasmid systems also require resistance to more than one antibiotic. the upp gene is nonessential (17) and can serve as a counterselectable marker. the upp gene is nonessential (17) and can serve as a counterselectable marker. the cell becomes 5-FU resistant if the upp gene is deleted. the surface display of antigens on the surface of L. casei cells has been confirmed by laser confocal microscopy. a single-plasmid system was suitable for the construction of recombinant strains of L. casei."}
