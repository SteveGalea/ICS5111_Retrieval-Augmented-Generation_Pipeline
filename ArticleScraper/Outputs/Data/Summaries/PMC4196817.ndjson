{"summary": "a mailed survey sent after the H1N1 outbreak compared with the results of similar survey completed after the SARS outbreak. participants A total of 183 randomly selected GPs and FPs who provided office-based care. the responses from this survey were compared with the responses of GPs and FPs in the greater Toronto area who completed a similar survey in 2003. a random selection was obtained from the online version of the Canadian Medical Directory. the listing was then hand searched to exclude ineligible practitioners including those known to be retired, deceased, or not practising in general or family practice. a priori sample size requirements indicated a target response of approximately 278 completed questionnaires. a modified Dillman mail survey technique was employed. the original SARS questionnaire was pretested and used in both the Toronto study and a parallel study in Hong Kong. the original SARS questionnaire was pretested and used in both the Toronto study and a parallel study in Hong Kong. a priori sample size requirement indicated a target response of approximately 278 completed questionnaires. this is based on a conservative estimate of 50% among all respondents. the first mailing included a cover letter that explained the study, the questionnaire, and a self-addressed envelope. the original SARS questionnaire was pretested and used in both the Toronto study and a parallel study in Hong Kong. however, because some questions were modified to update the questionnaire for this study, another pretest was conducted. responses to the 2010 questions were also compared with responses from the 2003 survey using the Pearson 2 test for association. 63.4% believed the current shortage of FPs would have serious effects on the local health care system\u2019s ability to prepare for a serious infectious disease outbreak. the 2003 and 2010 respondents were significantly more likely to postpone or cancel surgical procedures, avoid physical examinations, and postpone or cancel specialist appointments (P.01) insist every patient wear a mask 14.1 59.0* \u2022 Keep a greater distance between yourself and patients 27.1 48.6* \u2022 Request

that all staff members have their temperatures taken. most of the 2003 and 2010 respondents indicated that during a serious community outbreak, psychotherapy or counseling, nursing home, emergency department, and well-baby visits would not change. a significantly higher proportion of 2010 respondents were worried about infecting their family members with an infectious disease during a community outbreak. however, a significantly higher proportion of 2010 respondents were somewhat worried about dealing with serious outbreaks as front-line doctors in the community. the 2010 respondents rated their interest in various types of resources during an infectious disease outbreak in their community. the top 4 resources identified as being very to somewhat interesting were resources to protect and support the physicians, their staff, and their family members (eg, masks), protocols for the management of screening and treatment of patients. 69.9 24.6 1.6 Ongoing disease status reports 63.9

who indicated their inpatient care would remain unchanged in an outbreak. of 2010 respondents, 35.0% indicated they were willing to provide extra clinical care during a serious infectious disease outbreak. 37.7% were willing to work in immunization clinics, 42.6% to provide telephone counseling, 21.3% to provide home treatment, 25.1% to perform declarations of death, 26.8% to work in assessment clinics, 20.8% to work in treatment clinics and 27.3% to provide their names on a contact list. 0.2 NA 16.4 Telehealth Ontario 6.3 3.8 14.9 9.3 17.1 12.0 World Health Organization 6.6 11.5

concerns about how a serious infectious disease outbreak might affect their family members. the 2003 physicians who completed the after-SARS survey were much more likely to be concerned about themselves getting an infection than the 2010 physicians who completed the survey after the H1N1 epidemic. the 2003 physicians who completed the survey were much more likely to be concerned about themselves getting an infection than the 2010 physicians who completed the survey after the H1N1 epidemic. GPs and FPs are receiving adequate information during community outbreaks. it is also possible that GPs and FPs are more vigilant about preparing for a serious outbreak. the study found that FPs increased their surveillance of flu symptoms and provided vaccines to targeted groups. compared their responses to a similar survey completed by GPs and FPs after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. the 2010 respondents (after H1N1) were significantly more likely to wash their hands between patient encounters; wear masks, goggles, and gowns during patient encounters; and clean work surfaces with antiseptic at least once daily (P.01) les r\u00e9pondants de 2010 ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une \u00e9closion s\u00e9v\u00e8re dans la communaut\u00e9 n\u2019entra\u00eenerait pas de changement au niveau de la psychoth\u00e9rapie ou du counseling, des centres d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, des d\u00e9partements d\u2019urgence, des visites de contr\u00f4le des nouveaux-n\u00e9s normaux, des visites \u00e0 domicile, des soins palliatifs et des soins obst\u00e9tricaux."}
