{"summary": "human polyomaviruses are non-enveloped DNA viruses known to cause disease in immunosuppressed human populations by infecting the urinary tract and central nervous system. however, recent clinical studies using molecular assays to monitor for polyomavirus infections in pediatric patients have revealed an association between respiratory disease and two newly discovered polyomaviruses. the screening panel was ordered within 24 h of respiratory symptom onset. the panel may have been ordered in conjunction with other microbiological testing depending on the patient case. residual samples from clinical respiratory specimens were obtained from the in-house clinical microbiology laboratory. fam-TGTAGCCATGAATGCATACATCCCACTGC-tamra All respiratory samples were initially screened using qPCR conducted on a BIO-RAD CFX 96 (Hercules, CA, USA) the mix contained 10 L of probe PCR Master mix, 0.8 L each of 10 M forward and reverse primer, 0.4 L of 10 M probe, 3 L of nuclease-free water, and 5 l of sample nucleic acid extract. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) initial bivariate screening was conducted between selected covariates of interest and various outcome variables representing respiratory illness severity. predictors with a bivariate p 0.1 were then included in a stepwise, backward elimination unconditional linear regression model. sample processing The CML screens clinical respiratory samples with the D3 Double Duet DFA (Direct Fluorescent Antibody) Respiratory Virus Screening and ID Kit (REF: I-01-320000, Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) for influenza virus types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3. respiratory samples were initially screened using qPCR conducted on a BIO-RAD CFX 96 (Hercules, CA, USA) with the QIAGEN QuantiNova Probe PCR kit (Cat No: 208254, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the mix contained 10 L of probe PCR Master mix, 0.8 L each of 10 M forward and reverse primer, 0.4 L of 10 M probe, 3 L of nucleic acid extract in a final reaction volume of 20 L 0.05 were retained in the final model and adjusted prevalence ratios calculated. 214 patients and parents or guardians of patients granted informed consent and were enrolled. data from nine subjects were removed due to insufficient quantity of residual nasopharyngeal samples. asthma diagnosis Yes No 9 (15%) 51 (85%) 6 (4%) 135 (96%) PR = 0.55 95% CI (0.29\u20131.03) -Not significant- Pneumonia diagnosis Yes No 1 (1.67%) 59 (98.33%) 25 (17.73%) 116 (82.27%) PR = 1.45 95% CI (1.27\u20131.65) -Not significant- Received oral antibiotics during admission Yes No 14 (23%) 46 (77%) 74 (52%) bivariate analyses were performed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. overall, WU and KI viruses were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients. multivariate model revealed the use of bronchodilators and evidence of RSV infection to be significant predictors. the use of IV fluids and receiving oral antibiotics during admission showed a positive association with a diagnosis of bronchitis. both diagnosis of bronchitis and asthma showed an inverse association. use of bronchodilators Yes No 34 (21.66%) 123 (78.34%) 39 (88.64%) 5 (11.36%) PR = 13.67 95% CI (5.64\u201333.16) Diagnosis of Pneumonia Yes No 19 (21.66%) 138 (78.34%) 7 (88.64%) 37 (11.36%) PR = 1.27 95% CI (0.64\u20132.55) \u2013 Molecular detection of KI Yes No 21 (13.38%) 56 comparison of means was performed using student's t-test. adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using a stepwise, backwards elimination unconditional logistic regression model. patients with LOS 3days (n = 98) Unadjusted comparisons Age-group Less than 32 months 32 months or older 44 (44.90%) 54 (55.10%) 56 (54.37%) 47 (45.63%) Bronchitis diagnosis Yes No 26 (26.53%) 72 (73.47%) 13 (12.62%) 90 (87.38%) PR = 0.6 95%CI (0.38\u20130.95) -Not significant- Asthma diagnosis Yes No 12 (12.24 1 95%CI (1.18\u20131.93) Received bronchodilators during admission Yes No 43 (43.88%) 55 (56.12%) 30 (29.13%) 73 (70.87%) PR = 0.72 95%CI (0.53\u20130.96) -Not significant- Received oral antibiotics during admission Yes No 31 (31.63%) 67 (68.37%) 57 (55.34%) 46 (44.66%) PR = 1.59 95%CI (1.21\u20132.08) Molecular patients prescribed Oral Abx (n = 88) Unadjusted comparisons Age-group \u2013 Less than 32 months 32 months or older 50 (44.25%) 63 (55.75%) 48 (54.55%) 40 (45.45%) URTI diagnosis \u2013 Yes No 32 (28.32%) 81 (71.68%) 15 (17.05%) 73 (82.95%) PR = 0.67 95%CI (0.43\u20131.06) Asthma diagnosis Yes No 14 (12.39%) 99 109 (96.46%) 4 (4.55%) 84 (95.45%) No Convergence-*- Comparison of means was performed using student's t-test. values for pneumonia diagnosis, detection of adenovirus, and detection of metapneumovirus were not suitable for relative risk calculation. use of O2 during admission Yes No 5 (3.91%) 123 (96.09%) 39 (53.42%) 34 (46.58%) PR = 4.09 95%CI (2.98\u20135.61) PR = 3.67 95%CI (2.69\u20135.05) Molecular detection of KI \u2013 Yes No 15 (11.72%) 113 (88.28%) 11 (15.07%) 62 (84.93%) PR = 1.19; 95% CI (0.73\u20131.95) Molecular detection of KI \u2013 prevalence of KI detected in our study was 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) respectively. prevalence of KI has been reported as 7.0% in Korea, 4.2% in china, 6.29% in Thailand, 5.3% in the Philippines, and 16.4% in Japan (3, 4, 7, 17, 19) prevalence of KI in our study was higher than many other Southeast Asian countries. lack of significant differences in clinical diagnoses or severe disease interventions between polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients to suggest that the overall clinical burden of WU, at least in this small study, was small. in contrast, RSV was associated with the use of supplemental oxygen which demonstrated RSV's recognized increase in respiratory morbidity. we cannot comment on how respiratory polyomavirus infection affects children already infected with another virus. most of our samples came from nasopharyngeal swabs. there is inherent variability in sampling techniques. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
