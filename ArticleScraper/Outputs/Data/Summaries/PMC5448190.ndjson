{"summary": "nsp15 mutant viruses exhibited impaired viral replication and induced rapid cell death during infection of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. the parental MHV MHV-A59 (termed MHV-WT) and all mutant viruses were generated using reverse genetics. ifnar/ BMDMs were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and harvested at indicated times for CellTiter Glo assay. nsp15 mutant viruses replicate efficiently in a murine fibroblast cell line, 17Cl-1 cells, indicating that WT nsp15 is not required for viral replication in fibroblasts. nsp15 mutant viruses stimulated early and more robust induction of IFN- compared with MHV-WT or N3m virus. detection of IFN- mRNA in nsp15 mutant virus-infected cells peaked at 12 hpi and was slightly reduced at 16 hpi. protein was significantly higher in cell supernatants obtained from nsp15 mutant-infected cells compared with WT- or N3m-infected cells. increased detection of ISG54 in N15m1-infected cells was observed using immunofluorescence. BMDMs derived from ifih1/ mice did not express IFN during MHV infection. values were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA test by time in A\u2013C or an unpaired t test in D. data are representative of two to three independent experiments and presented as the mean SD. nsp15 mutant viruses activate apoptosis rather than RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis or caspase-1\u2013mediated pyroptosis. zVAD, a cysteine protease inhibitor, may also affect viral replication. nsp15 mutant viruses induce early apoptosis in macrophages. B6 BMDMs were infected with WT or mutant MHV at an MOI of 0.1. at indicated time points, caspase-3/7 activity was determined by a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay. values were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test by time. ifih1/ BMDMs with nsp15 mutant viruses induced elevated levels of caspase-3/7, which promoted rapid cell death. the results implicate a non-MDA5\u2013dependent pathway as an additional mechanism in the induction of apoptosis. to this end, we examined the protein kinase R (PKR) and the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L systems. first, we evaluated the level of phosphorylated eIF2, an indicator of PKR activation (35, 37), during infection. addition of C16, a specific kinase inhibitor of PKR (38), significantly reduced the levels of caspase-3/7 activity ifnar/ BMDMs were infected with MHV or mutant MHV at an MOI of 1. PKR inhibitor C16 blocks virus-induced apoptosis in macrophages. nsp15 mutant viruses activate host dsRNA-sensing systems in macrophages. RNA degradation pattern of RNAs from mock or infected B6 BMDMs (MOI 0.1) treated with C16 inhibitor (1 M) or zVAD (20 M) at 16 hpi. data are representative of two to three independent experiments. nsp15 protein and impairs endoribonuclease activity of nsp15. the T98M mutation resides at the interface between the N-terminal domain and middle domain of nsp15. the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 requires the formation of stable oligomers, which may be destabilized. BMDMs infected with WT or N15m1 virus at an MOI of 0.1 were lysed at 16 hpi and viral N protein, nsp15, and -actin were detected by Western blotting. a radiolabeled RNA molecule R16.4 was treated over time with WT nsp15 or T98M in presence of 5 mM Mn2+. DSF assesses the denaturation of proteins in the presence of a hydrophobic dye that will fluoresce upon binding to hydrophobic protein sequences. the T98M mutant denatured at 47 \u00b0C, 7 \u00b0C lower than the WT nsp15, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the T98M mutation renders nsp15 less stable. nsp15 endoribonuclease activity affects the distribution of dsRNA in BMDMs. the loss of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in the mutant viruses would correspond to an increase in immunofluorescence intensity of dsRNA. ifnar/ BMDMs were stained with anti-dsRNA, anti-nsp2/3, and Hoescht 33342. the foci from 25 images were counted using IMARIS software program. values were analyzed by a unpaired t test. dsRNA was dispersed late in infection, leading to a similar increase in the number of free-dsRNA foci in both WT- and N15m3-infected cells. ifnar/ BMDMs were infected with WT or N15m3 at an MOI of 0.1. surfaces for puncta were created based on dsRNA and nsp2/3 fluorescence. fluorescence was measured within each surface. the foci from 25 images were counted using IMARIS software program. nsp15 mutant viruses induce a robust IFN response and activate host dsRNA sensors. we first infected C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally with 6 104 plaque-forming units (pfu) of WT or mutant virus. at 24 hpi, MLN were harvested for RNA extraction. the N gene mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR and relative to -actin. titer in liver at 3 and 5 dpi was determined and (B) liver pathology at 5 dpi was evaluated by H&E staining. black arrowheads indicate the liver lesions caused by MHV infection. six-week-old mice were intracranially injected with 600 pfu of WT or mutant viruses. MHV nsp15 mutant viruses are highly attenuated for virulence in vivo. nsp15 mutant viruses are highly attenuated for virulence in vivo. nsp15 mutant viruses are highly attenuated for virulence in vivo. MHV nsp15 mutant viruses confers protective immunity against WT virus infection. ten-week-old nave mice or mice immunized with mutant virus 4 wk prior were intraperitoneally inoculated with 6.0 104 pfu of WT virus. at 5 dpi, organs were harvested for (A) viral titration and (B) liver pathology. n15m3 contains an alanine substitution in the catalytic histidine (H262A) residue of nsp15. previously shown to inactivate endoribonuclease activity (17, 25) we also generated a mutant virus with a single substitution in nsp3 (R971A), termed N3m. rapid cell death in nsp15 mutant viruses infected ifnar/ BMDMs (E) and syncytia formation in all virus-infected ifnar/ BMDMs (E). MHV-WT and the three mutant viruses replicate efficiently in a murine fibroblast cell line, 17Cl-1 cells. BMDMs were infected with MHV-WT or mutant viruses. the nsp15 mutant viruses stimulated an early and more robust induction of IFN- compared with MHV-WT or N3m virus. detection of IFN- mRNA in nsp15 mutant virus-infected cells peaked at 12 hpi and was slightly reduced at 16 hpi. ifih1/ mice did not express IFN when infected by either WT or mutant viruses. nsp15 mutant viruses trigger type I IFN response in macrophages. nsp15 functions as a type I IFN antagonist during MHV infection. ifih1/ BMDMs were infected with WT or N15m1 MHV at an MOI of 0.1. at 12 hpi, infected cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342 (nucleus; blue), antinucleocapsid (N; red), and anti-ISG54 (green). nsp15 mutant viruses induce early apoptosis in macrophages. MHV nsp15 mutant viruses induce early apoptosis in macrophages. a cysteine protease inhibitor may also affect viral replication. ifih1/ BMDMs were infected at an MOI of 0.1. cell viability and (E) caspase-3/7 activity were evaluated. values were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test by time. ifih1/ BMDMs treated with UV-inactivated supernatant contained replication-defective virus and IFN-. these cells lack MDA5 expression and, as shown in Fig. 2D, do not induce IFN during viral infection. but other dsRNA-sensing pathways remain intact in these cells. nsp15 mutant viruses infected with nsp15 mutant viruses compared with infection with WT virus. addition of C16 significantly reduced the levels of caspase-3/7 activity. nsp15 mutant viruses activate multiple independent host dsRNA-sensing systems in macrophages, including macrophages. MHV nsp15 mutant viruses activate host dsRNA sensors. at 8 hpi, cells were lysed and 20 g cell lysate was evaluated for phospho-eIF2, eIF2, viral N protein, and -actin. PKR inhibitor C16 blocks virus-induced apoptosis in macrophages. MHV nsp15 mutant viruses activate dsRNA sensors in macrophages. B6 BMDMs infected with WT or N15m1 at an MOI of 0.1. RNA degradation was evaluated in virus-infected (B) B6 BMDMs, (C) ifih1/ BMDMs, and (D) ifnar/ BMDMs. the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 requires the formation of stable oligomers. levels of nsp15 were significantly reduced in both N15m1- and N15m3-infected cells compared with WT-infected cells. it is possible that this phenotype could be because of the limited viral replication of nsp15 mutant viruses observed in B6 BMDMs or reduced detection of nsp15 mutant proteins by antis anti-nsp15 antibody detected nsp15-T98M mutant (red) proteins. radiolabeled RNA molecule R16.4 was treated over time with WT nsp15 or T98M in the presence of 5 mM Mn2+. the sequence of RNA R16.4 is shown above the gel image. the majority of nsp15 assembles to form oligomers at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. in contrast, the majority of the T98M nsp15 protein is detected in the monomeric form under these conditions. we reasoned that the instability of nsp15 imposed by the T98M mutation might impact endoribonuclease activity. nsp15 may prevent accumulation of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm. the loss of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in the mutant viruses would correspond to an increase in immunofluorescence intensity of dsRNA. however, we did not observe a significant difference between ifnar/ BMDMs at early or late phases of infection. the foci from 25 images were counted using IMARIS software program. previous studies reported that coronavirus dsRNA associates with replication complexes early during infection. nsp15 also associates with replication complexes. dsRNA was dispersed late in infection, leading to a similar increase in free-dsRNA foci in both WT- and N15m3-infected cells. dsRNA was dispersed late in infection, leading to a similar increase in the number of free-dsRNA foci in both WT- and N15m3-infected cells. nsp15 localization was calculated by dividing dsRNA+ nsp15+ foci by total dsRNA foci. values were analyzed by an unpaired t test and error bars represent the mean SEM, *P 0.05; **P 0.01; **P 0.001; n.s., not significant. standard plaque assays that enumerate infectious particles failed to detect virus in the livers and spleens of mice inoculated with nsp15 mutant viruses at 3 and 5 d postinfection (dpi) however, high viral titers were detected in the same target organs of mice infected with nsp15 mutant viruses at 1 dpi. ifnar/ mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 50 pfu of virus. viral pathogenicity was evaluated by (D) body weight loss and (E) survival rate. a lethal challenge model of MHV-A59 was used to determine if nsp15 mutant viruses are attenuated. injection of 600 pfu of WT virus into the mouse cranium is sufficient to induce lethal encephalitis (47, 48) mice were infected intraperitoneally with 6 104 pfu of nsp15 mutant viruses. the same mice, as nave, were challenged with 6 104 pfu of WT virus. viral burden and liver pathology were assessed at 5 dpi. dsRNA viruses replicate via dsRNA intermediates can be detected as \u201cnonself\u201d by host dsRNA sensors. dsRNA sensors include several cytoplasmic RIG-I\u2013like receptors (RLRs), such as RIG-I and MDA5. coronaviruses encode mutations in nsp15 and mutant viruses. nsp15 mutant viruses were highly attenuated and able to elicit a protective immune response against subsequent challenge with WT virus. previous studies have shown that coronaviruses encode multiple proteins that antagonize recognition of viral dsRNA. the strain of murine coronavirus used in this study encodes accessary protein ns2. this protein is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate, the product of OAS. loss of ns2 PDE activity attenuates viral pathogenicity in the liver but not in the brain. nsp15 may play a dominant role over ns2/NS4a/Ns4b activity in antagonizing host dsRNA sensors. loss of ns2, NS4a, or NS4b alone is not sufficient to activate these sensors in all cell types. the mechanism by which nsp15 endoribonuclease activity suppresses the activation of dsRNA sensors is unknown. nsp15 can bind to a highly conserved, hairpin-structured RNA molecule. this molecule contains a right-angle turn and a loop with multiple potential cleavage sites. nsp15 colocalizes with membrane-associated viral replication complexes. this study provides insights into the role of nsp15 as an antagonist of host dsRNA sensors during coronavirus infection in macrophages and in mice. nsp15 was a gift from John Fleming (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, WI) anti-dsRNA (#K1, Scicons), anti-ISG54 (#PA3845, ThermoFisher) and anti\u2013p-eIF2 (#sc-12412, Santa Cruz) nucleotide changes were incorporated into the MHV-A59 genome through PCR mutagenesis (primers available upon request) viral RNA was extracted from virus stock using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (57704, Qiagen) Mutant MHV sequences were aligned to the WT MHV-A59 synthetic construct (GenBank accession no.
