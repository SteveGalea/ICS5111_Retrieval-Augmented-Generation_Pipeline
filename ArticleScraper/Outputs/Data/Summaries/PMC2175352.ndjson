{"summary": "single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), horizontal gene transfer and/or intragenic recombination are all known to lead to variations and genome plasticity in an organism. whole-genome sequencing is probably the most accurate and reliable method to identify and type strains of an organism. mockler et al. (2) recently provided an excellent overview of applications of DNA tiling arrays for whole-genome analysis. the whole-genome, array-based resequencing and SNP identification approach is simple and time efficient, enabling high-resolution analysis of a number of strains in a matter of days. genome sequencing of strains at a single nucleotide resolution will prove useful for basic and applied areas of biodefense and infectious disease research. the whole-genome resequencing was performed in duplicate for all sequences used in the batch analysis. high confidence base calls were made by virtue of two features within each locus hybridizing with greater efficiency than alternative features. the Affymetrix GSEQ software assigned a quality score to each base call that combined hybridization information from both the forward and reverse strands. there are 12 869 bp of sequences unique to LVS relative to SCHU S4 and 42 369 bp present in SCHU S4 but not LVS. 179 193 bp. (9.22%) of repetitive sequence were excluded from the design. 303 366 bases of double-stranded DNA can be resequenced on a 300 K array. genemic DNA (10 ng) in 2.5 l of 1 TE was denatured at room temperature for 3 min by the addition of an equal volume of 50 mM KOH, 1.25 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) the solution was neutralized by the addition of 5 l of 1 M Tris\u2013HCl, pH 4.0. customSeq\u00ae kit was used for DNA fragmentation, labeling and hybridization of amplified F. tularensis DNA. 12 g of amplified DNA was fragmented in a 300 l reaction and 12 l of fragmentation reagent for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. the GSEQ software produces a CHP file containing the base call, the reference base and a quality score for each locus on the resequencing chip. each filter serves to reduce the number of candidate SNP calls. the output of one filtering step becomes the input for the next. it scans the base calls from the CHP files to identify regions of adjacent positions that are rich in no-calls and SNP calls. it uses a sliding-window approach, first looking at windows of 50-base length (user specified) for regions whose content of no-calls plus SNP calls comprises 60% or greater of the specified window size. the extent of the region is determined by expanding the region using a 50-base length window. alternate homology effect is significant in the context of whole-genome hybridization. a whole-genome DNA sample will naturally contain a larger population of distinct 25-mer sequences than a small subset of the genome. for this reason, the alternate homology effect is significant in the context of whole-genome hybridization. a minimum alignment length of 13 bases guarantees that the SNP base will be included in all alignments found. the program examines the SNP alignments and calculates the binding energies. the alignment representing the highest binding energy is selected and compared with the free energy of binding of the reference 25-mer to its reverse complement. the GSEQ quality score threshold was set to 3.0, and our quality filter was applied using different threshold values. the remaining SNP calls are next put through the footprint effect filter. the occurrence of a real SNP in a query sample results in a destabilizing effect on 25-mers. footprint effect filter algorithm assumes that a genuine SNP is most likely to cause spurious SNP calls at locations within 10 bases on either side of the genuine SNP. any number of consecutive SNP calls within 10 base positions of each other may occur in the data, this filter is implemented as a recursive algorithm. candidate SNPs or unexpected base calls (290) were validated for reference strains. unexpected SNP calls as well as a subset of false-negative calls (562 total) were also validated. genome samples were stored at 80\u00b0C. whole-genome resequencing was performed in duplicate for all sequences used in batch analysis and query strains were sequenced in quadruplicate. plasmids, pOM1 (GenBank Accession: NC 002109) and pFNL10 (GenBank Accession: NC 004952) were obtained from the NCBI database. this sequence differs from the submitted sequence by 13 insertions and deletions. repeatFinder identified 170 356 and 139 560 bp of repetitive sequence in LVS and SCHU S4 respectively. 179 193 bp. (9.22%) of repetitive sequence were excluded from the design. 303 366 bases of double-stranded DNA can be resequenced on a 300 K array. the reactions were terminated by heating at 65\u00b0C for 3 min. the amplified DNAs were purified using 96-well purification microplates. ation reagent (0.15 U/l, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. labeling reactions, prehybridization, hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of the arrays were performed as described. our bioinformatic filters consist of a set of Perl scripts that operate on the CHP files and produce a list of high-confidence SNP calls from the larger raw set of SNP calls present in those files. each filter serves to reduce the number of candidate SNPs. the extent of the region is determined by expanding the region using a 50-base length window as far as possible. the algorithm uses a 10-base window to map the breakpoint of the distal end of the deletion. SNP calls that occur within the defined low-homology region are removed from the list of high-confidence SNP calls. Query location is shown in bold and mismatches are shown in red. the top pair represents a sample DNA sequence perfectly matching a reference probe. the next pair illustrates a sample DNA sequence partially matching a SNP probe pair. a delta binding energy threshold of 11.5 kcal/mol was chosen based on the effect of different threshold values on the false-negative and false-positive calls. the next filter in our pipeline is a quality filter that simply eliminates SNP calls that have been assigned low quality scores by the GSEQ software. the occurrence of a real SNP in a query sample results in a destabilizing effect on 25-mers in the immediate vicinity of the SNP. the locus on the resequencing chip at which the SNP occurs contains two probes that hybridize perfectly with the sample. however, at adjacent loci on the chip, which represent base positions near the SNP base, there are no probes that hybridize perfectly with the sample DNA. footprint effect filter algorithm assumes that a genuine SNP is most likely to cause spurious SNP calls at locations within 10 bases on either side of the genuine SNP. any number of consecutive SNP calls within 10 base positions of each other may occur in the data, this filter is implemented as a recursive algorithm. the algorithm identifies the SNP call having the highest quality score.
