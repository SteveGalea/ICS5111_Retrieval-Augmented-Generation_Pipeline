{"summary": "each year in the united states, seasonal influenza virus infection result in an estimated 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations. the prevalence of drug-resistant strains, which has been reported for both classes of antiviral drugs for seasonal influenza, could undermine their clinical benefit when used as monotherapy. ten 2009 H1N1 isolates tested in the united states have been found to be resistant to oseltamivir. the CDC has reported that ten 2009 H1N1 isolates tested in the united states have been found to be resistant to oseltamivir. this raises the concern that dually resistant viruses may become prevalent. our findings highlight the utility of the TCAD regimen as a potential approach to address the current limitations of antiviral potency and drug resistance. our findings highlight the utility of the TCAD regimen as a potential approach to address the current limitations of antiviral potency and drug resistance. oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/Mississippi/3/01 (H5N1) was provided by the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Surveillance Network. oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/Mississippi/3/01 (H1N1) was provided by the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia) at 0, 0.000032, 0.0001, 0.00032, 0.001, 0.0032, 0.01, 0.032, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100 g/mL; amantadine, rimantadine, and ribavirin at 0, 0.001, 0.0032, 0.01, 0.032, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100 g/mL. at three days after infection, the virus control wells exhibited 100% cytopathology 50 and TC50 calculations were made by normalizing the NR data for each well against the cell and virus controls. normalized data were plotted as percent cell viability versus compound concentration. the data points were then fitted using four-parameter curve fitting in Graphpad Prism to derive the EC50 and TC50. synergy volumes 100 g/mL2% or g/mL3% for triple combinations are considered strongly antagonistic. the synergy of the cytotoxic effects of double and triple combinations were calculated in a similar manner. the cave of each drug was determined by pharmacokinetic modeling using a non-compartmental model in the progam WinNonLin. the recommended doses, along with the pharmacokinetic parameters, were obtained from the package inserts for amantadine [14], oseltamivir [15], and ribavirin [16] and the references therein. oseltamivir carboxylate, 130 g/mL ribavirin, is the active metabolite of oseltamivir. peramivir was obtained from Jubilant Chemsys LTD as free base. influenza A/Duck/1525/81 (H5N1) was provided by Dr. Robert Webster. oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/Mississippi/3/01 (H1N1) was provided by the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Surveillance Network. oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/Mississippi/3/01 (H1N1) was provided by the Neuraminidase Inhibi tamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and peramivir at 0, 0.000032, 0.0001, 0.00032, 0.001, 0.0032, 0.01, 0.032, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100 g/mL. untreated wells of infected cells, uninfected cells, and drug cytotoxicity controls were included on each test plate. gy calculations were made by normalizing the NR data for each well against the cell and virus controls. normalized data were plotted as percent cell viability and 0% cell viability respectively. differences in EC50 values between two curves with a P-value of 0.05 were considered significant. synergy volumes >100 g/mL2% or >100 g/mL3% for triple combinations are considered to be strongly antagonistic. the synergy of the cytotoxic effects of double and triple combinations were calculated in a similar manner. the cave of each drug was determined by pharmacokinetic modeling using a non-compartmental model in the progam WinNonLin. the recommended doses, along with the pharmacokinetic parameters, were obtained from the package inserts for amantadine [14], oseltamivir [15], and ribavirin [16] and the references therein. the EC50 of TCAD regimen as a fixed dose combination was determined as ratio of the Cave and expressed in units of fold-Cave. the susceptibility of three 2009 H1N1 influenza strains \u2013 A/California/04/09 (CA04), A/California/05/09 (CA05) and A/California/10/09 (CA10) \u2013 to each of six antiviral drugs was determined by measuring the inhibition of virus-induced synergy of double and triple combinations of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir carboxylate against 2009 H1N1. the synergy occurred at clinically achievable concentrations for all three drugs, given that the expected average plasma concentrations are 0.43 g/mL for amantadine, 1.3 g/mL for. the synergy of the TCAD regimen was greater than the synergy of any double combination tested for all three 2009 H1N1 strains. the addition of each drug as the third drug resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in synergy. adine 106208 312195 22684 0.32 g/mL amantadine 292212 293154 29682 1.0 g/mL amantadine 346212 337196 311139 3.2 g/mL amantadine 475221 48597 413163 TCAD at fixed concentrations of ribavirin (g/mL3%) 0.1 g/mL ribavirin 92119 14682 combinations with synergy volumes 100 g/mL2% or g/mL3% are considered strongly antagonistic. Bold numbers denote volumes that are defined as strongly synergistic or antagonistic. data are presented as the mean between 18 replicates from 6 experiments. the concentrations of each drug used in double and triple combinations are provided in Table S1. amantadine had no significant antiviral activity as a single agent below 3.2 g/mL. synergy was observed over a wide range of concentrations of ribavirin and oseltamivir carboxylate tested. at lower concentrations of amantadine, synergy occurred at 1 g/mL ribavirin and higher, and at 0.0032 g/mL oseltamivir carboxylate and higher. no significant antagonism was observed at any dose of any drug. the EC50 for oseltamivir carboxylate as a single agent was reduced 16.2-fold in combination with 1 g/mL ribavirin and 1 g/mL amantadine (Table 2). for all three drugs, the reduction in EC50 values observed in the triple combination was statistically significant (P0.05), indicative that each drug had greater antiviral potency and was effective at lower concentrations. g/mL ribavirin and 0.0032 g/mL oseltamivir carboxylate 7.6 6.0\u20139.6 3.2 1.7 1.6 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 Ribavirin (A) alone 6.5 6.2\u20136.9 \u2013 \u2013

CA05, and CA10. synergy plots for the NAI double combinations against CA05 revealed regions of antagonism (red areas), which occurred at higher concentrations of zanamivir (0.01\u20130.1 g/mL) analysis of the EC50 of each NAI in combination with a fixed concentration of a second NAI revealed that the antiviral activity of each drug was not enhanced in combination with a second drug. the observation that double combinations of neuraminidase inhibitors were not synergistic is consistent with the fact that all three drugs are known to target the same enzyme. amantadine did not make a contribution to the activity of the TCAD regimen against the DK A30T virus. ribavirin and oseltamivir remain active and their interactions were additive, indicative that two out of three drugs contribute to the activity of the TCAD regimen against this virus. data are presented as the mean between 10 replicates from 4 experiments with 95% confidence intervals for NC V27A, 27 replicates from 9 experiments with 95% confidence intervals for WI S31N, and 12 replicates from 4 experiments with 95% confidence intervals for DK A30T. oseltamivir carboxylate had no antiviral activity against either virus below 1 g/mL. amantadine/oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine/ribavirin, and ribavirin/oseltamivir carboxylate were all additives. the synergy volume was greater than the synergy volume of any double combination. oseltamivir carboxylate is not active as a single agent against these resistant strains. avirin, oseltamivir carboxylate against oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses were incubated with MDCK cells in the presence of drugs. synergy volumes are plotted for each double combination, and for the triple combination as a function of increasing concentration of each drug as the third drug. the EC50 of oseltamivir carboxylate was not reduced in double combination with 1g/mL ribavirin or 0.032 g/mL amantadine against HI H274Y. however, in triple combination with ribavirin and amantadine at the same concentrations used in double combination, the EC50 of oseltamivir carboxylate was reduced by 21-fold against MS H274Y. with 1 g/mL ribavirin and 0.032 g/mL amantadine 3.4

dilution curve of the TCAD regimen was created by preparing a solution of all three drugs at 100-fold the Cave of each drug. the IQ was determined as a ratio of the cave and expressed in units of fold change from the cave. concentration-response curves for amantadine, ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, and TCAD were generated against all three viruses. oseltamivir carboxylate was effective at inhibiting NC20 and MS H274Y in vitro, resulting in IQs of 1.95 and 7.17. the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) and inhibitory quotients (IQ) for amantadine, ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, and TCADa against representative susceptible and resistant viruses. a TCAD, triple combination antiviral drug (amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir carboxylate) was formulated as a fixed-ratio combination based on the Cave of each drug. at 1-fold Cave each drug was present at the following concentration: 0.43g/mL amantadine, 0.3 g/mL oseltamivir carboxylate, and 1.3 g/mL riba ine did not produce inhibition up to the 50% cytotoxic concentration (EC50>12 g/mL; >55 M) the EC50 values for the six drugs as single agents against all three strains are summarized in Table S2. the three virus strains remain susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, peramivir, and ribavirin. the synergy of the TCAD regimen occurred at clinically achievable concentrations for all three drugs. the expected average plasma concentrations based on the recommended doses are 0.43 g/mL for amantadine, 1.3 g/mL for ribavirin, and 0.3 g/mL for oseltamivir carboxylate. the synergy of the TCAD regimen

concentrations of two drugs for a double combination or all concentrations of two drugs at a fixed concentration of the third drug for the TCAD regimen. combinations with synergy volumes >100 g/mL2% or g/mL3% for triple combinations are considered to be strongly synergistic. seltamivir carboxylate is a triple combination of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir carboxylate as a function of (B) amantadine concentration, (C) ribavirin concentration, and (D) oseltamivir carboxylate concentration. the concentrations of each drug used in double and triple combinations are provided in Table S1. synergy plots for the TCAD regimen showed a concentration-dependent increase in synergy with respect to amantadine. at the highest concentration tested (3.2 g/mL), synergy was observed over a wide range of concentrations of ribavirin and oseltamivir carboxylate tested. no significant antagonism was observed at any dose of any drug in the double and triple combinations. the EC50 for ribavirin as a single agent was reduced by 2.7-fold in combination with 0.0032 g/mL oseltamivir carboxylate and 1 g/mL amantadine. the EC50 for oseltamivir carboxylate as a single agent was reduced 16.2-fold in combination with 1 g/mL ribavirin and 1 g/mL amantadine. mL ribavirin 13 12\u201314 1.8 \u2013 \u2013 0.0001 \u2013 \u2013 (C) with 1 g/mL ribavirin and 0.0032 g/mL oseltamivir carboxylate 7.6

data presented here do not represent the maximum reductions in EC50 values for the three drugs. at higher concentrations, the antiviral activity of the second and third drug contributed significantly to the inhibition. the synergy plots for the NAI double combinations against CA05 revealed regions of antagonism (red areas), which occurred at higher concentrations of zanamivir (0.01\u20130.1 g/mL) and at variable concentrations of the second NAI (oseltamivir or peramivir, Figure S2). similar results were found with the other two 2009 H1N1 strains. the synergy of the TCAD regimen in the presence of amantadine was greater than the synergy of the ribavirin/oseltamivir carboxylate double combination without amantadine. the increase in the synergy of the TCAD regimen was observed at 0.32 g/mL amantadine for NC V27A and 1 g/mL amantadine for WI S31N, when significance was evaluated at the level 0 g/mL amantadine is the ribavirin/oseltamivir carboxylate double combination. data are presented as the mean between 10 replicates from 4 experiments with 95% confidence intervals for NC V27A, 27 replicates from 9 experiments with 95% confidence intervals for WI S31N. synergy volumes of double and triple combinations of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir were determined against both viruses. as double combinations, amantadine/oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine/ribavirin, and ribavirin/oseltamivir carboxylate were all additive. gy occurred at higher concentrations of amantadine (0.1 g/mL or higher) and at wide concentrations of ribavirin. no significant antagonism was detected at any concentrations of the three drugs. the EC50 of oseltamivir carboxylate as a single agent was 74 g/mL against MS H274Y and 15 g/mL against HI H274Y. the EC50 of oseltamivir carboxylate was not reduced in double combination with 1g/mL ribavirin or 0.032 g/mL amantadine. 1.0 g/mL ribavirin >100 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.1127 \u2013 (C) with 0.032 g/mL amantadine >100 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013

TCAD regimen within the concentration ranges tested. cells treated with the TCAD regimen at the highest concentrations tested for all three drugs used in the combination experiments exhibited 97% viability. this was not statistically different than the cell control. amantadine was effective at inhibiting NC20 and MS H274Y in vitro. oseltamivir carboxylate was effective at inhibiting NC20 and MS H274Y in vitro, resulting in IQs of 1.95 and 7.17. the IQs for the TCAD regimen as a fixed dose combination were consistently high against all three viruses (8.33 to 17.24), varying by no more than 2-fold between susceptible and resistant viruses. these data suggest that the regimen may have broad utility against all circulating influenza strains, including strains that are resistant to either amantadine or oseltamivir. a triple combination antiviral drug (amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir carboxylate) was formulated as a fixed-ratio combination based on the Cave of each drug. the EC50 of TCAD is expressed as a ratio to the Cave. authors found that presence of amantadine in double combinations did not provide added benefit over the second drug alone, either in cell culture or in mouse models. study examined efficacy and synergy of the TCAD regimen against viruses which were resistant to oseltamivir or amantadine. cross-resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir resulting from a single amino acid change has been documented for seasonal influenza A and B viruses. if this were to occur in the 2009 H1N1 background, the resulting virus would be resistant to all approved anti-influenza drugs. in total, we tested the activity and synergy of the TCAD regimen against six amantadine-resistant viruses, including three strains of 2009 H1N1 damantanes or oseltamivir are expected to be susceptible to the TCAD regimen. rapid diagnostic tests are not available to determine the susceptibility profile of influenza viruses in real time. the availability of a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy that would be effective against the majority of circulating strains regardless of the susceptibility would be of high clinical utility. amantadine and oseltamivir carboxylate contribute to the synergy of the TCAD regimen against resistant strains that were resistant to these drugs. ribavirin has been documented to act through multiple mechanisms affecting both virus replication and host immune response [36]\u2013[38]. this suggests that a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir may be an effective and viable therapeutic option for the treatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza. the safety, pharmacokinetics, distribution, and metabolism of the three drugs as single agents are well understood. EC50 and TC50 values are the mean of at least 5 experiments (three replicates per experiment) as determined by Neutral Red assay. aRimantadine was not active up to the 50% cytotoxic concentration. values were derived from mean triplicate data and presented at 95% confidence. blue areas indicate concentrations of each drug that are synergistic, gray areas indicate concentrations that are additive, and red areas indicate concentrations that are antagonistic. intensity of the color corresponds to percent inhibition above or below expected.
