{"summary": "antibody-mediated neutralization is generally considered to occur extracellularly due to exclusion of antibody from the cell interior by membrane compartmentalization. extracellular viral neutralization is thought to require a given level of antibody occupancy of specific epitopes to prevent entry into cells. cytosolic TRIM21 induces a synchronized effector and signaling response. TRIM21 recognition is distinct from that of other innate sensors. TRIM21 treats the displacement of antibody from the extracellular to the intracellular environment as a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) (12). TRIM21 treats the displacement of antibody from the extracellular to the intracellular environment as a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) (12). TRIM21 is a cytosolic Fc receptor that executes its effector functions alone or in synergy with the complement system. TRIM21 is a multi-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, a B-box domain, a coiled-coil dimerization domain and a C-terminal PRYSPRY domain. TRIM21 is also known as Ro52 and was first identified as a major autoantigen in autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. YSPRY domains bind to each side of the homodimeric Fc. the TRIM21 binding site is located at the CH2-CH3 interface of the Fc. it overlaps with that of the neonatal Fc receptor (37, 38) and viral and bacterial defense proteins (39\u201341) the TRIM21-IgG interaction is highly conserved across species. TRIM21 distinguishes itself from other Fc receptors in that its PRYSPRY domain does not only bind all four IgG subclasses but also IgM and IgA. cytosol has been studied using human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) as a model pathogen. TRIM21 mediates a sequential and coordinated effector and signaling response. this involves proteasomal degradation of the virus and induction of an anti-viral cellular state through activation of immune signaling pathways. -containing protein (VCP), an enzyme with segregase and unfoldase activity, is needed to degrade viral particles. intact capsids have to be disassembled before the individual components are degraded in the proteasome. TRIM21 binds to the Fc part of the antibody in which auto-inhibition is released. TRIM21 activity prevented MAV-1 induced hemorrhagic encephalitis. mice lacking TRIM21 had higher viral loads and increased mortality compared to wild-type (WT) animals. naive mice demonstrate TRIM21 dependent protection. rh9C12-WT vs. rh9C12-H433A mutation ablates TRIM21 binding without impairing binding to other Fc receptors. TRIM21 specifically induced genes related to innate and intrinsic immunity as opposed to genes associated with a strong inflammatory response such as acute phase proteins. engagement of retroviral capsids by TRIM5 can induce oligomerization and hexagonal assembly via B-Box interactions between multiple TRIM5 molecules. RING dimerization is not required for E2 enzyme binding it is needed to form contacts with E2-charged ubiquitin. mutations at the RING dimerization interface disrupt its catalytic activity in vitro. truncated form of TRIM21 containing only the RING and B-Box domains (59) this is explained by the fact that the B-box mimics and occupies the E2 ubiquitin ligase binding site on the TRIM21 RING domain. this is preventing its auto-ubiquitination and activation of immune signaling. a similar regulatory mechanism exists for unrelated innate immune adaptors such as mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (MAVS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF) signaling is potentiated by serine phosphorylation of a similar pLxSI motif (60). TRIM21 dependent neutralization proceeds independently of the S80 phosphorylation state. TRIM21 PRYSPRY domain was reported to up-regulate the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR. this translated into enhanced cross-priming and activation of CD8+ T cells at high multiplicity of infection. this translated into enhanced cross-priming and activation of CD8+ T cells at high multiplicity of infection. this has been demonstrated for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bound by the therapeutic monoclonal IgG1 antibody palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae) (12). other non-enveloped viruses, such as HRV-2, form a pore in the endosomal membrane through which their genomes are injected. paratope of the antibodies as well as epitope on the virus may also determine whether it can be targeted by TRIM21. pre-existing antibody immunity against the virus severely limits its use as it often prevents expression of the transgene (72). however, pre-existing antibody immunity against the virus severely limits its use as it often prevents expression of the transgene (72). however, pre-existing antibody immunity against the virus severely limits its use as it often prevents expression of the transgene (72). antiviral immunity was established using an engineered influenza virus strain (H1N1) carrying the SL8 peptide in its neuramidase stalk. this resulted in reduced anti-tumor immunity as shown by challenge of Ad-OVA immunized animals with the OVA secreting fibrosarcoma cell line MCA101. TRIM21 negatively impacts gene therapy, but the activity of the receptor may be favorably utilized for other therapeutic applications. neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by aggregation of the intracellular microtubule-associated tau protein (20) intracellular tau aggregates are generated from extracellular tau and can spread between cells. TRIM-Away allows the depletion of specific proteins in primary human cells. this was demonstrated by depleting IKK and NLRP3 in mouse eggs. TRIM-Away has also been used to demonstrate involvement of SNAP23 in meiotic arrest and regulation of exocytosis. the duration of knockdown by TRIM-Away correlates with the amount of antibody and TRIM21 present. TRIM21 is saturable when cells are exposed to high viral loads in complex with antibody (44), which is explained by its expression level. despite TRIM21 being IFN-inducible, the expression level of TRIM21 is in many cases a limiting factor for the TRIM-Away strategy. TRIM21 synergizes with the complement system. in humans, the complement system consists of more than 20 proteins that label pathogens for destruction via the classical, mannose lectin or alternative pathways. after labeling, viruses may still enter endosomal compartments. deposited C3 enter cells via CAR and v3/5 mediated endocytosis. (A2) Ad5:C3 complexes escape into the cytosol where C3 is detected. this may occur synergistically with TRIM21 engagement. some non-enveloped viruses inject their viral genome into the cytosol via pores formed in endosomal membranes. antibody opsonized pathogens may recruit the C1 complex (C1qC1r2C1rs2) to initiate the classical complement pathway. this neutralization mechanism depends on binding of C1 to antibody-opsonized Ad5 and subsequent C4b deposition on the virus. the virus is routed down the endo-lysosomal pathway and does not reach the cytosol. TRIM21, C1 and C4 dependent neutralization pathways may operate synergistically during Ad5 infection (17, 18) this raises the question as to which of these neutralization mechanisms dominate under different conditions. antibody engineering Boosts Gene Therapy Insights into how pre-existing antibodies limit the efficacy of gene therapy. one strategy may be to pre-coat vectors with an antibody engineered to ignore both C1q and TRIM21, such as P329A/H433A. rh9C12 that binds to the apex of the hexon trimer spike (61) may be particularly well suited for such pre-coating. this combination strategy improved the tumor to liver localization ratio of the Ad5 vector and circumvented intracellular neutralization by TRIM21. of TRIM21 to engage three different antibody isotypes (7, 43) is in sharp contrast to other receptors that are highly selective in regard to both isotype and subclass binding properties. early primary immune responses to infections are dominated by IgG3 followed by IgG1, both of which are considered anti-viral subclasses (118\u2013121). injection of antibodies into the vitreous is often used in the clinic to treat eye diseases such as age-related macular edema (124, 125). using engineered antibodies with reduced affinity for TRIM21 or altered antigen binding kinetics could be attractive to reduce inflammation without compromising virus neutralization (42, 61)."}
