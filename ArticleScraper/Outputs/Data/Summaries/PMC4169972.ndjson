{"summary": "nsp12 is able to extend a homopolymeric primer-template substrate by a few dozen nucleotides in vitro. but in a nonprocessive (distributive) manner (21) nsp12 was previously reported to interact with nsp8 in GST pull-down experiments (39), which displayed a primase-like RdRp activity (30\u201332) nsp8 alone was inactive on the LS2/LS1 RNA primer/template. pairwise combinations of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 displayed no significant polymerase activity either. nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 were simultaneously present in the reaction mixture. WT or mutant (D760A) nsp12 were coexpressed with nsp7-L-nsp8 fusion protein (7L8) after purification of the 7L8/nsp12 complex on a Strep-Tactin column. analysis by 12% SDS/PAGE and Coomassie blue staining of the proteins constituting the complex (nsp12 WT or mutant) was done. nsp12 is a fusion protein in which the nsp7 C terminus is linked to the nsp8 N terminus by an engineered peptide of 6 (or 12) amino acids residues. when nsp12 is complexed with an uncleaved nsp7\u2013nsp8 polyprotein (either 7\u20138/12 or 7\u20138HC/12), these protein complexes fail to show polymerase activity (Fig. S2B the 7L8 fusion protein is highly unlikely to assemble into a similar hexadecameric structure, due to topological constraints. the nsp7/nsp8 complex forms a heterotrimer (32), clearly pointing to the plasticity of this coV protein complex that could be relevant for 7L8. the mutant is still able to bind to 7L8 (Fig. 1C) but is incapable of RNA synthesis in the presence of either separately purified de novo RNA polymerase assays were performed using template 3R and a protein complex consisting of 7L8 copurified with the active site knockout mutant of nsp12. no de novo polymerase activity is detected using a mixture of the three proteins purified independently from coli. nsp7/nsp8 complex is capable of de novo initiation of RNA synthesis on a template with the same sequence as the 3\u2032-proximal domain of the viral RNA genome. the nsp7/nsp8 complex enhances processivity of nsp12-mediated RNA synthesis. exogenous LS2/LS1 should trap all free polymerase complexes as soon as they would fall off the 3R template. this last condition would allow visualization of RNA products resulting from a single de novo (or backpriming) initiation event. the 7L8/12 polymerase complex processively replicates the 3R RNA template. the LS2/LS1 template was used as a trap at 20 M. RNA products and residual radiolabeled ATP* are indicated on the right of the autoradiograph. 7L8/12 RNA binding affinity is higher in elongation than in initiation mode. nsp7 and nsp8 confer RNA-binding capacity to the nsp12 RdRp. EMSAs were performed with 100 nM radiolabeled RNA template. nsp12 alone and the other mutants presented here did not show any ability to bind the probe (0%) these values are averages from quantification of three independent experiments. nsp7 and nsp8 residues may confer RNA template-binding ability to the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex. nsp7 mutants were quantified in primer extension and de novo polymerase activities. nsp7 mutants were assayed either in the context of separately purified nsp7 plus nsp8 plus nsp12 for primer extension assays. five nsp8 mutations are associated with a strong decrease of both primer-dependent and de novo polymerase activities. the 7L8/12 complex containing the nsp8 K58A mutant shows strongly reduced RNA binding. 7L8/12 WT complex for de novo polymerase activity was set at 100%. level of copurification of 7L8(WT) relative to nsp12 was taken to represent 100% of nsp12/nsp8 protein interaction. three nsp7 residues (K7, H36, and N37) and one nsp8 residue (K58) appear important for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA. 7L8(mutants) relative to 7L8(WT) was taken to define 100% of nsp12/nsp8 protein interaction. mutants D99A, P116A, P183A, and R190 lose their ability to interact with nsp12. interaction between nsp12 and nsp8 D50A, K58A, K82A, and S85A mutants is unaffected. p8 function (i.e., D52, K82, and S85) (30, 31), which have phenotypes comparable to that of the WT control in our biochemical studies (Table 2). Mutant viruses were launched by electroporation of in vitro-generated RNA transcripts into BHK-Tet-SARS-N cells. these cells can be transfected efficiently and release progeny virus, but do not support further viral spread because they lack the ACE2 receptor all three nsp7 mutants are crippled compared with the WT control. nsp7 and nsp8 mutants were harvested from transfected cells at 42 h p.t. two mutants (D52A, K82A, D99A, and P116A) not showing major defects in biochemical assays were impaired when tested by reverse genetics. this transition coincided with the discovery of second-site mutations, specifically a D78N substitution in one experiment. the nsp7/Nsp8/Nsp12 polymerase complex is able to associate with an active bifunctional Nsp14. the nsp14 replicase subunit binds to nsp12 (Fig. S1B and ref. 39) the polymerase activities of the 7L8/12 and 7L8/12/14 complexes are comparable. nsp10 is able to either enhance nsp14-ExoN activity in situ. nsp14 N7-MTase activity is also found associated with the 7L8/12/14 complex. the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12/nsp14 complex represents a unique assembly. time course exoribonuclease assays were performed using the 7L8/12/14 (500 nM) complex in the absence or presence of 100 nM nsp10. the RNA substrate was a 40-nt RNA (LS1) annealed with 5\u2032-radiolabeled LS3 primer carrying one noncomplementary base at its 3\u2032 end (LS3*) nsp12 was previously reported to interact with nsp8 in GST pull-down experiments (39), which showed a primase-like RdRp activity (30\u201332) nsp7/nsp8 may modulate nsp12 RdRp activity (29, 40), suggesting that a tripartite complex may be formed. however, such a direct interaction between these three proteins remained undetected (Fig. S1D) the highest RdRp activity was obtained upon addition of an equimolar amount of nsp12 to a preincubated 1:1 mixture of nsp7 and nsp8. the level of association of nsp7 and nsp8 may constitute a limiting factor for obtaining a high RNA polymerase activity. AGE and Coomassie blue staining of proteins constituting the complex (nsp12 WT or D760A mutant) was done. nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 were either purified and added separately. reactions were performed on RNA template LS2*/LS1. p8 polyprotein (either 7\u20138/12 or 7\u20138HC/12) fails to show polymerase activity. results indicate that inserting a linker between nsp7 and nsp8 may be sufficient to imitate the effect of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 cleavage and associated structural rearrangements on nsp12 RNA polymerase activity. nsp12 (D760A) mutant is still able to bind to 7L8 (Fig. 1C) but is incapable of RNA synthesis in the presence of either separately purified nsp7 and nsp8 or copurified 7L8. the 7L8/12 polymerase complex catalyzes de Novo RNA Synthesis. de novo RNA polymerase assays were performed using template 3R and a protein complex consisting of 7L8 copurified with the active site knockout mutant of nsp12. the 7L8/12 polymerase complex catalyzes de novo RNA synthesis. polymerase complex to the periodate-treated 3\u2032 end of the template. we tested a variant of the 3R template carrying a 3\u2032-terminal 20-residue poly(A) tail. the efficiency of 7L8/12-mediated RNA synthesis is unchanged on this template compared with that of the template without poly(A) tail. all polymerase assays were started by the addition of the NTP mixture. as a control, a reaction was performed without the LS2/LS1 trap. the products from abortive RNA synthesis are only detected after longer incubation times. RNA products and residual radiolabeled ATP* are indicated on the right of the autoradiograph. the obtained koff value (Fig. S5; 7.9103 s1) indeed reflects a very low dissociation rate. EMSAs were performed with 100 nM radiolabeled RNA template (LS2*/LS1) and increasing concentrations of the indicated proteins. nsp7 and nsp8 confer RNA-binding capacity to the nsp12 RdRp. 5 nsp7 residues and 16 nsp8 residues were selected for substitution with alanine. nsp7 residues K7 and N37 are found to be essential for RdRp activity. replacement of H36 confers a moderate decrease in primer-dependent polymerase activity. nsp7 WT plus nsp8 WT plus nsp12 WT primer extension activity was set at 100%. mutants highlighted in dark gray indicate important residues for in vitro polymerase activities. the 7L8/12 complex containing the nsp8 K58A mutant shows strongly reduced RNA binding (Fig. 4B), consistent with the observed loss of polymerase activity. nsp7 WT plus nsp8 WT plus nsp12 WT primer extension activity was set at 100%. nsp7 residues (K7, H36, and N37) and one nsp8 residue (K58) appear to be important for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA. nsp8/Nsp12 interaction is critical for nsp12 RdRp activity. nsp8 mutants D99A, P116A, P183A, and R190A were analyzed for their ability to interact with nsp12. four nsp8 residues (D99, P116, P183, and R190) are critical for the interaction of nsp8 with nsp12 in vitro. the importance of the coronavirus nsp7 and nsp8 subunits for virus replication in vivo has barely been addressed thus far. transfected cells were mixed with (susceptible) Vero-E6 cells. each mutant was tested twice, by transfection of RNA derived from two independently generated cDNA clones. this material was used to confirm the presence of the engineered mutation(s) and investigate possible second-site reversions. phenotypes of viable but crippled mutants with engineered nsp7 and nsp8 mutations are shown on the left. mutant virus was harvested from transfected cells at 42 h p.t. mutants with a phenotype similar to WT virus are listed at the bottom. two mutants (D99A, P116A) not showing major defects in biochemical assays were impaired when tested by reverse genetics. p8 mutants (D52A, K82A) showed a reduced plaque size, although its growth kinetics was quite similar to what was found for the WT virus. the nsp14 replicase subunit binds to nsp12 in the context of the 7L8/12 complex. interaction of 7L8, nsp12, and nsp14 is readily detected. nsp14 ExoN activity is either very weak due to the stimulating-factor absence or suppressed when the 7L8/12/14 complex is in \u201cpolymerization mode\u201d the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12/nsp14 complex represents a unique coronavirus nsp assembly that incorporates RdRp, exoN, and N7-MTase activities. the nsp14 complex possesses RdRp, exoribonuclease, and N7-MTase activities. substrate was a 40-nt RNA (LS1) annealed with 5\u2032-radiolabeled LS3 primer carrying one noncomplementary base at its 3\u2032 end (LS3*) and named LS3*/LS1. digestion products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. coronaviruses have evolved a mechanism of RNA synthesis that is unique among RNA viruses. nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex can synthesize an RNA of, at least, 359 nt when synthesis is started without a primer (de novo) assays reflect only a part of the complexity of coronavirus RNA synthesis in vivo. it is conceivable that the effects of single-point mutations on properties like RNA binding are more dramatic in the context of the trimeric complex in vitro than in a 16-nsp complex in vivo. however, these data constitute the first evidence (to our knowledge) for a role for nsp7 in viral RNA synthesis. nsp8 in complex with nsp12 and nsp7 adopts a structural conformation that prevents the synthesis of short RNAs. it is thus plausible that a particular function of coronavirus nsp7 and nsp8 may in fact be triggered by the nature of their partnership and/or quaternary structure. coronaviruses now are the first RNA viruses known to use an RdRp processivity factor, to expedite replication of their 30-kb RNA genome. the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex binds to the bifunctional exoribonuclease/N7-guanine cap methyltransferase nsp14. all SARS-CoV proteins used in this study were expressed in a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-free system, with the exception of nsp10 and nsp14. all plasmids were expressed in E. coli C2523 cells, whereas E. coli C41 (DE3; pLysS) (Novagen) was used for nsp14 expressions. nsp12 was induced by addition of 500 M isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. plasmid pJ404 was cloned into plasmid pJ404 (purchased from DNA2.0) nsp12 was recovered using lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin. nsp7 (K7A, H36A, and N37A) mutants as well as nsp8 (K58A, D99A, P116A, P183A, and R190A) mutants. correct folding was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD spectra) beads were diluted in 2 SDS/PAGE loading buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 6.8; 200 mM DTT; 4% (vol/vol) SDS; 0.2% bromophenol blue; 20% (vol/vol) glycerol) a Western blot was then performed using a single HRP-conjugate antibody (anti-His5 HRP conjugate; Qiagen) de novo assays, using either 3R or 3RA as template, were started by adding 500 M GTP, UTP, CTP, 50 M ATP, and 0.17 M [-32P]ATP (0.5 Ci/L) reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (formamide with 10 mM EDTA) LS3 has the same sequence as LS2 with the addition of an adenosine at its 3\u2032 end, causing an A:A mismatch when annealed with template LS1. Mutations in the SARS-CoV nsp7- or nsp8-coding region were engineered in prSCV. six-well clusters for immunofluorescence microscopy analysis and analysis of virus production. each mutant was launched twice from two independently generated BAC clones. all work with live SARS-CoV was performed in a biosafety level 3 facility. vero-E6 cells seeded in six-well clusters were infected with serial 10-fold dilutions in PBS, 0.005% DEAE, and 2% (vol/vol) FCS of supernatants. cells were fixed with 7.4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde in PBS and stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. fusion protein 7L8 was cloned into pASK3-Kana backbone. nsp12 expression was induced by addition of 500 M isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. nsp12 was recovered using lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin. the 7L8/12 complex was obtained after cotransformation of plasmids encoding 7L8 and nsp12. site-directed mutagenesis to generate plasmids expressing mutant proteins was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) nsp12 was bound to Strep-Tactin beads and incubated with 1 mg/mL BSA. the beads were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 15 g of his-tagged partner protein. a Western blot was performed using a single HRP-conjugate antibody. primers (LS2 or LS3) were radiolabeled at their 5\u2032 ends using [-32P]ATP and PNK. LS2* or LS3* were then annealed to the complementary template LS1. reactions were started by adding 500 M NTP mix. the reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 30 \u00b0C. samples were loaded directly onto 6% (vol/vol) acrylamide gels. exonuclease reactions performed as previously described (24) with 500 nM radiolabeled LS3*/LS1 substrate. BHK-Tet-SARS-N cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with vero-E6 cells. each mutant was launched twice from two independently generated BAC clones. nsp12-coding region was amplified in two overlapping fragments. RT-PCR products were sequenced to verify the presence of the introduced mutations and possible second-site reversions. transfected cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed at various time points."}
