{"summary": "the viral genome consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of about 8500 nts, encoding a single polyprotein. Upon entry into the cell, the viral open reading frame is translated into a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. a viral protein (VPg) is covalently linked to the 5\u2032end of the viral RNA. in vitro synthetized FMDV RNA (50 pg) was annealed with the indicated concentrations of AONs AUG1, AUG2 or the scramble SCR prior to transfect confluent BHK-21 cell monolayers in duplicate. values represent the mean and standard deviation of triplicate assays (*** P0.01). domain 4 is composed of a conserved hairpin-loop and a polypyrimidine-rich tract preceding the first functional AUG codon. specific RNA motifs located in domains 2, 4 and 5 are responsible for the interaction with cellular proteins such as PTB, eIF4G, eIF3 and eIF4B. oligodeoxynucleotides are single-stranded sequences that form a hybrid with their complementary RNA via Watson-Crick base pairing. the hybrid can block gene expression by various mechanisms, depending on the chemical composition of the oligonucleotide and location of the hybrid. an independent study using antisense morpholino oligomers targeting the viral RNA start codons also showed the capacity of these small molecules to inhibit viral FMDV multiplication. the latter study showed controversial results with a previous work [36] in which phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to AUG2 inhibited viral RNA expression. 2\u2032OMe oligonucleotides targeting AUG1 and AUG2 inhibit FMDV RNA translation in BHK-21 cells. results Differential inhibition of FMDV RNA infectivity by 2\u2032O-methyl-antisense oligonucleotides targeting AUG1 and AUG2 in tissue culture cells is peculiar in that protein synthesis can be initiated at two start codons.

Western blot of viral protein VP1 accumulated in BHK-21cells 24 hpt. anti-tubulin was used as a loading control. no inhibitory effect was detected with AONs 104, 118, 135, and 154. Western blot of representative examples of viral protein VP1 accumulated in BHK-21cells 24 hpt; anti-tubulin was used as a loading control. yield observed in the presence of AONs 317, 331, 360, 384, 397, 407 and 419 were all above 60%. oligonucleotides (40, 183, 349, 432 and AUG2) remained inhibitory 48 hpt. the inhibition noticed at 48 hpt indicated the potential of the AONs to inhibit viral replication. translation efficiency in vitro induced by AONs annealed to the FMDV RNA varied. the stem of domain 2 was able to withstand the presence of AONs 40 and 83 (65% and 64%, respectively) titer determined 6 hpi differed strongly between AUG1 and AUG2. the decrease in virus titer in the presence of AUG1 was about 80% of the control cell monolayer. the results are in full agreement with the data obtained in infectious RNA transfections. a black bar denotes inhibitory capacity (*** P0.01) relative to control infection. we have made use of 2\u2032OMe AONs complementary to the FMDV IRES-AUG translation start region to explore the capacity of these molecules to interfere viral RNA translation. oligonucleotides complementary to domain 2, the apical region of domain 3 and domain 5 were the most efficient inhibitors in transfected cells. this inhibition was confirmed when the viral protein VP1 accumulated in the cell cytoplasm prior to cell detachment was measured by immunodetection. phosphorothioate derivatives targeting some of these regions were inhibitors of virus multiplication. hamster BHK-21 or swine IBRS-2 cell lines are known to have an inactive type I IFN system in response to FMDV infection [55], [56] it is unlikely that the differences observed between the in vitro lysates and the transfected cells are due to type I interferon production. domains 4 and 5 provide the binding site for eIFs and IRES-transacting factors (ITAFs) controlling internal initiation of translation. RNA-based antiviral strategies were able to suppress virus multiplication in cell culture, as illustrated for HCV [63], [64], FMDV [65] or poliovirus [58], [66]. we have taken advantage of the stability of 2\u2032OMe AONs to explore the accessibility of the entire IRES-AUG region. a scrambled sequence of 16 nt, with 50% GC content, was included as specificity control. the scrambled sequence was checked with NCBI-BLAST software. MFold and oligo analyzer were used to predict the secondary structure of each antisense oligoribonucleotide. infectivity of viral RNA synthesized in vitro was determined using increasing amounts of FMDV RNA (25 pg to 2 ng) to transfect BHK-21 cell monolayers. virus yield from 50 pg of FMDV RNA yielded about 1.6103 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. transfected cells were infected with serial dilutions of the supernatant. one hour after adsorption, the viral inoculum was removed. the cells were stained with 0.3% crystal violet in 2% formaldehyde. the viral titer from the 24 and 48 hpt supernatant was determined by counting the viral plaques that developed after 24 hpi. the virus yield was calculated as the mean of PFU/ml of three independent assays of FMDV RNA transfected BHK-21 cells. cell monolayers were used to determine ASO cytotoxicity by cell staining at the end of the treatment. cleotides design Thirty-two antisense oligoribonucleotides designed to hybridize with the IRES, AUG1 and AUG2 of FMDV RNA. 2\u2032OMe AONs are named by the IRES nt position which is complementary to the 5\u2032 end of each oligoribonucleotide. a scrambled sequence of 16 nt, with 50% GC content, was included as specificity control. RNA annealed with AON to a reaction mix containing 6.5 l of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL), 1 l (1 mM) amino acid mix less methionine and 0.5 l (6 Ci) 35S-methionine. reaction was treated with 1 l of RNase A, incubated for 10 min at room temperature and fractionated in polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sul a mixture of lipofectine-RNA washed with each AON in 0.5 ml of DMEM. cell monolayers were washed with DMEM three times and 2 ml of fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS was added. at 24 and 48 hpt, 200 l supernatant was collected. the viral titer from the 24 and 48 hpt supernatant was determined by counting the viral plaques that developed after 24 hpi. the virus yield was calculated as the mean of PFU/ml of three independent assays of FMDV RNA transfected BHK-21 cells with each 2\u2032OMe AON. atants were collected at 0 and 6 hpi for virus titer determination. in vitro synthetized FMDV RNA (50 pg) was annealed with the indicated concentrations of AONs AUG1, AUG2 or the scramble SCR. Virus yield was determined using fresh cells monolayers."}
