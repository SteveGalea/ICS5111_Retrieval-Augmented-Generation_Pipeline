{"summary": "CD-type lectin DC-SIGN and novel HIV attachment factor CLEC-2 are expressed by platelets and facilitate HIV transmission from platelets to T-cells. soluble proteins indicated that CLEC-2 does not recognize the viral envelope protein, but a cellular factor expressed on kidney-derived 293T cells. evidence was obtained that podoplanin expression is connected to apoptosis. the envelope protein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus mediates infectious viral entry into target cells. this process depends on the interactions of Env with proteins displayed at the surface of host cells. infectivity is due to the interaction of virion-incorporated factors with their cognate receptors on HIV target cells. attachment of HIV to dendritic cells can also promote HIV infection of adjacent T-cells. this property has been associated with the expression of DC-SIGN [16], a calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin. carbohydrate recognition sequence contains 17 amino acid residues highly conserved between C-type lectins. CLEC-2 does not bind to the viral Env protein, but to a cellular factor incorporated into the viral envelope. it is at present unclear how CLEC-2 interacts with HIV.

PBMCs were isolated from whole blood or leukocyte filters by centrifugation. a NL4-3-based reporter virus bearing EGFP in place of nef was generated by splice overlap extension (SOE) PCR. a NL4-3 env fragment was amplified using primers pJM206 and pJM394. both PCR fragments were fused by SOE PCR using primers pJM395 and pJM396. a codon-optimized gp120 (JRFL) was generated by amplifying a codon-optimized gp120 (JRFL) with primers gp120_BamHI 5'-GAGTGGATCCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCC-3' (sense) followed by insertion of the PCR fragment in the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of the Fc-IgG1 encoding plasmi a PCR fragment encoding the extracellular domain of podoplanin fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin was cloned into pAB61 using the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. the identity of all PCR amplified sequences was confirmed by sequencing with an ABI3700 genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding proviral DNA. culture medium was changed 12 h post transfection. supernatants were harvested at 48 h post transfection. 5 105 cells were incubated with Fc-fusion proteins and Fc-control protein at 4\u00b0C for 45 minutes. cells were stained with anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. cell-staining was then analyzed by flow cytometry. shRNAs were constructed by using shRNA Hairpin Oligonucleotide Sequence Designer Tool. the shRNA contained the target shRNA sequence, a hairpin loop region \"TTCAAGA\" and an antisense shRNA sequence followed by a pol III terminator sequence. the vector allows stable expression of small hairpin RNAs in transduced cells. transduced cells were selected in medium containing 10 g/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) cells were stained for apoptosis with PE-conjugated annexin V (R&D Systems, Minnesota, USA) and for necrosis with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Sigma, Germany) soluble versions of DC-SIGN and CLEC-2 were generated by fusing the extracellular domain of these lectins to the Fc-portion of human immunoglobulin. binding was substantially enhanced upon expression of the HIV-1 NL4-3 Env protein on 293T cells. however, binding was not inhibited by mannan and was not enhanced by expression of the viral Env protein. 293T cells were either control transfected with empty vector or transfected with an HIV-1 NL4-3 Env expression plasmid. the cells were preincubated with PBS or mannan and then DC-SIGN-Fc or CLEC-2-Fc fusion proteins or an Fc-control protein were added. unbound proteins were removed by washing and bound proteins detected by flow cytometry. results represent the average of the geometric mean channel fluorescence (GMCF) soluble podoplanin is expressed on 293T cells and binds to CLEC-2. soluble podoplanin fused to the Fc-portion of human immunoglobulin was analyzed. soluble podoplanin is expressed on 293T cells and binds to CLEC-2. 293 T-REx CLEC-2 cells were doxycycline treated to induce CLEC-2 expression or PBS treated. binding of soluble podoplanin-Fc or Fc-control protein was analyzed. the results represent the average SEM of the GMCF measured in three independent experiments. podoplanin-Fc fusion proteins were produced in wt CHO cells or CHO cells due to defects in either the medial Golgi localized N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (CHO Lec1) or the trans Golgi localized CMP-sialic acid transporter (CHO Lec2) have lost their abilities to produce complex N-glycans and sialylated glycoconjugates, respectively. the indicated CLEC-2 mutants were transiently expressed on 293T cells. expression (white bars) and binding of podoplanin-Fc (black bars) analyzed by flow cytometry. results represent average SEM of the GMCF measured in three independent experiments. GMCF: geometric mean channel fluorescence, PDPN: podoplanin, SEM: standard deviation of the mean. results so far indicated that podoplanin is expressed by 293T cells and that podoplanin specifically interacts with CLEC-2. we then assessed if podoplanin is incorporated into virions produced in 293T cells and that podoplanin specifically interacts with CLEC-2. planin was incorporated into virions released from control cells and from the podoplanin knock-down cells. for this, the cells were transfected with env-deficient HIV-1 proviral DNA. the supernatants concentrated by size-exclusion filtration and virions pelleted through a sucrose cushion. a faint signal for virions generated in podoplanin knock-down cells was observed. 293T cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding EGFP. transduced cells were puromycin-selected and podoplanin expression was determined by flow cytometry. average SEM of five independent experiments, for which GMCF was determined, is presented. transmission of HIV-1 produced in 293T cells not transduced with shRNA-encoding vector was set as 100%. control indicates B-THP cells stably transduced with empty vector. results represent the average SEM of five independent experiments carried out in triplicate. apoptosis can result in surface expression of proteins which are not found on the surface of viable cells. it is thus possible that podoplanin expression is up-regulated during apoptosis. however, apoptosis can also non-specifically change antibody reactivity of cells. a relatively non-selective protein kinase inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces staurospores. treatment of PBMCs with staurosporine induced binding of annexin V and anti-podoplanin-specific antibodies 18H5 and NZ-1. evidence that apoptotic cells express podoplanin was assessed by flow cytometry. serum-starved CEM174 cells were incubated with 1 M staurosporine for indicated times. then stained with anti-podoplanin antibody 18H5 and annexin V. results represent the average of two independent experiments. Podoplanin is not expressed on HIV-1 infected primary and immortalized T-cells. at 7 days post infection the infected cells were stained with podoplanin-specific antibody 18H5 and annexin V. the results were confirmed in two separate experiments. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown, error bars indicate SD. a representative experiment performed in triplicate was carried out as described in (A) but transmission of HIV-1 SF33 generated in PBMC was analyzed. soluble DC-SIGN bound to 293T cells with higher efficiency than the Fc-control protein. binding was not inhibited by mannan and was not enhanced by expression of the viral Env protein. we therefore concluded that CLEC-2 does not capture HIV-1 Env. soluble podoplanin, a recently identified CLEC-2 ligand, is expressed on 293T cells. the cellular mucin podoplanin is endogenously expressed by kidney podocytes. Flow cytometric analysis indeed revealed high levels of podoplanin on the surface. 293T cells were either transfected with empty vector or transfected with a podoplanin expression construct. cells were stained with anti-podoplanin antibody 18H5. results represent the average SEM of the GMCF measured in three independent experiments. colleagues demonstrated that binding of CLEC-2 to rhodocytin is glycosylation independent. mutations K150A, E187A, K190A and N192A decreased binding of CLEC-2 to rhodocytin in surface plasmon resonance binding studies. all changes, with exception of K190A, were compatible with efficient expression of CLEC-2. analyzed in a FACS-based assay, podoplanin produced in lec1 cells still bound to CLEC-2 with appreciable efficiency. the observed differences indicate that the presence of sialic acid is essential for binding to CLEC-2. this finding provides evidence that sialic acid is essential for binding to CLEC-2. glucosaminyltransferase (no complex N-glycans are generated), CHO Lec2 cells lack the CMP-sialic acid transporter (no sialylated glycoconjugates are generated) the supernatants of the transfected cells were harvested, concentrated and analyzed by Western blot. the results represent the average SEM of the GMCF measured in three independent experiments. we first tested a panel of podoplanin-specific shRNAs and identified one shRNA which efficiently reduced podoplanin expression in transiently transfected 293T cells. subsequently, this shRNA was stably introduced into 293T cells by employing a retroviral vector, which also contained an expression cassette for EGFP. after cultivation in selection antibiotics, all cells were positive for EGFP and thus harboured the vector genome. a markedly higher podoplanin signal was measured in the supernatants of HIV transfected compared to mock transfected cells. we then asked if reduced podoplanin incorporation affects HIV-1 interactions with CLEC-2. for this, virions were generated in control and podoplanin knock-down cells. Podoplanin expression on cells expressing control shRNA was set as 100%. an env-defective NL4-3 proviral genome was transiently expressed in 293T cells transduced with vector encoding either podoplanin-specific shRNA or non-sense shRNA. the supernatants were harvested and either processed directly or concentrated by size-exclusion filtration. apoptosis can result in surface expression of proteins which are not found on the surface of viable cells. apoptosis can result in surface expression of proteins which are not found on the surface of viable cells. staining of apoptotic cells was also observed with a different podoplanin antibody (clone NZ-1 [60], data not shown) in contrast, staining of apoptotic cells was not observed with several unrelated antibodies (see Additional file 2). Moreover, binding of both antibodies, 18H5 and NZ-1, to apoptotic cells could be inhibited by the pre-incubation of antibodies with soluble podoplanin before staining of cells cultured CEM174 cells were serum-starved and podoplanin expression on viable and apoptotic cells, as determined by forward and sideward scatter. cells were co-stained with podoplanin-specific antibody and the apoptosis marker annexin V or the necrosis marker 7-AAD, and staining analyzed by flow cytometry. podoplanin is not expressed on HIV-1 infected primary and immortalized T-cells. at 7 days post infection the infected cells were stained with podoplanin-specific antibody 18H5 and annexin V. cytopathic effect was visible in infected cells at seven days post infection. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown, error bars indicate SD. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown, error bars indicate SD. DC-SIGN binds to the HIV Env protein, while CLEC-2 recognizes (a) cellular factor(s) incorporated into HIV particles. a potential link between podoplanin expression and apoptosis was discovered. soluble CLEC-2 did not recognize soluble HIV Env. binding of soluble CLEC-2 to 293T cells was not augmented by expression of HIV Env. mannan and EDTA did not interfere with ligand binding to CLEC-2. docytin and podoplanin may therefore engage CLEC-2 differentially. a potential lectin-activity of CLEC-2 requires further investigation. docytin and podoplanin may therefore engage CLEC-2 differentially. Podoplanin/CLEC-2-dependent platelet stimulation by tumour cells promotes hematogenous tumour metastasis [71,74] podoplanin/CLEC-2-dependent platelet stimulation by tumour cells promotes hematogenous tumour metastasis [71,74], possibly by inducing growth factor secretion by platelets. nested RT-PCR detected podoplanin message in CEM174 cells. this suggests low levels of podoplanin expression in these cells. this suggests that binding is most likely specific. however, reactivity depends on the availability of the antigen-binding site. CLEC-2 on platelets may induce platelet activation, which was found to be associated with HIV infection [78]. both processes could impact viral load and disease development. authors declare that they have no competing interests. in to CLEC-2 mutants, determined the impact of glycosylation and divalent ions on podoplanin binding to CLEC-2, analyzed podoplanin expression on cell lines and determined podoplanin incorporation into virions. JS analyzed podoplanin expression on HIV infected PBMCs, YK provided critical reagents and contributed to the interpretation of experiments. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. a gate was defined which comprise both viable and non-viable cells. the results of a representative experiment are shown and were confirmed in an independent experiment."}
