{"summary": "more than three-fourths of communicable human diseases are zoonotic in origin. some of these diseases originate in wildlife and others in domestic livestock species. there is growing interest in promoting cooperation between medical and veterinary sectors. intensification and risk: ecological and biological features. domestication of wild animals brought them into close contact with human populations. growth in demand and production has extended grazing and farming into natural ecosystems. industrial enterprises account for 74% of the world\u2019s poultry production, 40% of pork, and 68% of egg production. the health implications of these developments are uncertain. large-scale intensive units may be good at biosecurity because they are more isolated from the external environment and better protected from infection through sustained veterinary control. imported specialized breeds may be more vulnerable to pathogens than indigenous breeds. zoonotic risks may be greatest in landscapes where large-scale production units are in close proximity to traditional, small-scale production and to wildlife populations. public distrust in central government resulting from corruption, conflicts, and political instability may disrupt public health systems and disease surveillance. lack of trust in government agencies associated with this outbreak is considered to have been an important factor in the sharp fall in immunizations with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. in less-developed countries, such alternative forms of risk regulation may be absent. pressure to survive in a highly competitive market with minimal government support may encourage retailers and producers to engage in risky practices, including disinvestment in animal health and biosecurity. international trade is another element in the political economy of risks from livestock production. global trade in livestock and livestock products has substantially increased in recent years because of the proliferation of free trade agreements, more efficient transport and communication systems. the key scientific challenges are a) to correctly define and understand the risk environment as part of a larger system that creates risk; b) to deploy a method that combines insights along the full extent of the chain of evidence. the first level of analysis involves integration of disciplinary expertise to provide a rich sociobiological characterization of risk environments. the contribution of social scientists enhances understanding of both the political economy and the actual practice of livestock production. evolutionary or ecological conditions that favor emergence pose the greatest risk. emergence and spread of new zoonotic pathogens are likely to be affected by changes in specific features of the risk environment. this complex issue requires integration of disciplinary perspectives and diverse empirical material. macroeconomic modeling has the potential to embed such heterogeneous data sets into a comprehensive framework for assessments of specific interventions in terms of cost benefits and cost effectiveness. the computable general equilibrium approach, a member of the \u201cwhole economy\u201d class of economic models, can be used to account for differential effects of policy options on categories of social actors. the development of modeling tools able to account for the combination of potential risk factors, as well as their health and economic effects, requires the translation of a diverse range of socioeconomic, biological, cultural, and epidemiological information into a common language for data collation, comparability, and analysis. this process is likely to be difficult because different disciplines may rely on different bases for causal inference, notions of impact, measurement systems, and theoretical frameworks. risk scenarios are given in order to identify policy options for risk management."}
