{"summary": "75% of WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic, 25% develop west Nile fever (WNF) and 1% are characterized by neuroinvasive disease. the true impact of WNV on human health is unknown because WNF is often undiagnosed. sporadic cases of transfusion-acquired WNV disease continue to occur due to false-negative NAT results. Approximately 47,500 patients received corneal transplants in the united states in 2015. human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 2.5 g/mL fungizone. a preliminary investigation into the potential for WNV transmission due to keratoplasty. research consent was obtained for all donor corneas. all tissues were determined to be suitable for cornea transplantation. tissues were transported to Iowa State University on ice. PCRs were performed using superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) the mouse ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) gene was used as a reference for normalization. protein lysates were prepared from cultured cells and corneas. protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer, heated (95\u00b0C for 5 minutes) and resolved on 8\u201316% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) Membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. Membranes were then washed and incubated with 1/2,000 horseradish peroxidase\u2013conju mL of the same medium containing 0.22% neutral red was added to each well. viral titers were expressed as plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu/mL) in vitro experimental infections. supernatant aliquots (100 L) were harvested from each culture dish at 2, 3, 4 and 5 days PI. each aliquot was clarified by centrifugation to remove free-floating cells from the preparation. nine 6- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 300 pfu of WNV. all animal experiments were carried out under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch. each mouse eye was dissected into an anterior fraction containing cornea and posterior fraction containing retina, sclera, and choroid. corneoscleral tissue was obtained, inspected, and stored in Optisol GS (Bausch & Lomb, Irvine, CA) at 4\u00b0C in accordance with EBAA-compliant protocols at Iowa Lions Eye Bank. all tissues were determined to be suitable for cornea transplantation. GATGATATCG-3\u2032 and AGMa-R were designed to target a 556-nt region of the -actin gene. complementary DNAs were generated using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) PCR products were examined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. supernatants were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. Western blots. proteins were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer, heated (95\u00b0C for 5 minutes) and resolved on 8\u201316% Tris-glycine gels. membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in phosphate-buffered saline. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days (HSV-1) or 3 days (WNV) 3 mL of the same medium containing 0.22% neutral red was added to each well. viral titers were expressed as plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu/mL) KSFM culture media supplemented with BPE, rEGF, antibiotics, and fungizone. media was not removed from the culture dishes before virus inoculation. supernatant aliquots (100 L) were harvested from each culture dish at 2, 3, 4 and 5 days PI. eyes were transported on ice to the University of Iowa for processing. all animal experiments were carried out under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. each mouse eye was dissected into an anterior fraction containing cornea and posterior fraction containing retina, sclera, and choroid. subconfluent monolayers of (A-B) HCE cells and (C-D) Vero cells in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 (lanes 1\u20136) or they were inoculated with an equal amount of heat-inactivated virus (lanes 7\u201312) after 1 hour, the virus inocula were removed and the cell monolayers were rinsed twice in phosphate-buff western blot inoculated human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. subconfluent monolayers of HCE cells in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 (lanes 1\u20136) or an equal amount of heat-inactivated virus (lanes 7\u201312) after 1 hour, the virus inocula were removed, and the cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered in vitro growth kinetics and yields of west Nile virus (WNV) in human corneal epithelial (HCE) and Vero cells. subconfluent monolayers of HCE and Vero cells in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and incubated for 1\u20136 days. supernatants were collected and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. corneas were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of 15 (lanes 1\u20136). another three corneas were inoculated with an equal amount of heat-inactivated virus. ten intact human corneas were placed into individual 35-mm culture dishes. culture dishes that contained media in the absence of corneal cells were also inoculated with WNV to assess the longevity of the input virus. at 2, 3, 4, and 5 days postinoculation, an aliquot of each cell culture supernatant was collected from each culture dish. RT-PCRs for human RPL11 and AGM -actin were used to assure equal loading in each lane. subconfluent monolayers of (A-B) HCE cells and (C-D) Vero cells in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 (lanes 1\u20136) or they were inoculated with an equal amount of heat-inactivated virus (lanes 7\u201312) after 1 hour, the virus inocula were removed and the cell monolayers were rinsed twice in phosphate-buff the virus reached a peak titer of 2.5 107 pfu/mL at 3 days PI. the virus reached a peak titer of 2.5 107 pfu/mL at 3 days PI. in vitro growth kinetics and yields of west Nile virus (WNV) in human corneal epithelial (HCE) and Vero cells. subconfluent monolayers of HCE and Vero cells in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and incubated for 1\u20136 days. supernatants were collected and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. six corneas were inoculated with WNV at a multiplicity of 15 (lanes 1\u20136). another three corneas were inoculated with an equal amount of heat-inactivated virus (lanes 7\u20139) at 2, 3, 4, and 5 days postinoculation, an aliquot of each cell culture supernatant was collected from each culture dish. an aliquot of each culture supernatant was collected from each culture dish, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. no WNV expression was detected in four infected mice and both uninfected mice. it has been proposed that WNV disseminates from the central nervous system to the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid via optic nerve fibers. however, WNV has never been detected in optic nerve fibers or corneas procured from deceased patients with systemic infection. this may indicate that WNV cannot replicate in or disseminate into these tissues. the availability of a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013expressing WNV complementary DNA infectious clone can be exploited to define the cellular distribution of the virus within murine ocular tissues. however, our IHC analysis demonstrated that several different anti-WNV antibodies cross-reacted with endogenous mouse proteins. keratoplasty using WNV-infected donor mice and uninfected recipient mice may determine more conclusively the likelihood of WNV transmission due to corneal transplantation fifteen corneas (from 12 patients) that had not been preincubated were inoculated with WNV for 5 days. three corneas yielded maximum viral titers of 63\u2013322 pfu/mL. the others did not support virus replication. the clinical impact of these findings is unknown currently. corneal tissues need to be acquired from deceased WNV patients. the ability to maintain an adequate supply of corneas safe for transplantation is crucial to protecting the public."}
