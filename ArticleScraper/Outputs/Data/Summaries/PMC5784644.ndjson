{"summary": "a total of 249 patients underwent curative transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for primary or recurrent NMIBC were asked to complete the Korean version of EORTC QLQ-C30 and -NMIBC24 questionnaires three times. results Multitrait scaling analysis confirmed satisfactory construct validity in five scales except the malaise scale. despite complete removal of NMIBC by TURBT, significant proportions of patients undergo tumor recurrence ranging from 15% to 90% within 5 years. clinical practice may be associated with various side effects and patient morbidity. reliable and valid measure of such patient QOL is becoming important assessment of clinical outcomes as the issues of disease-free and BC-specific survival. translation of the questionnaire from English into Korean was independently conducted by two translators (two MDs) who are fluent in both English and Korean. a second consensus meeting was held between the translators and two main investigators. the original and two back-translated versions were compared. linguistically validated QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaire was self-administered to patients at pre-specified time points. post-TURBT questionnaires were done before follow-up cystoscopy at approximately 30 minutes after local analgesics intramuscular injection. the validity of the QLQ-NMIBC24 was examined with three approaches. known-group comparisons were used to determine the ability of the questionnaire to discriminate between subgroups of patients differing in known clinical status. a second consensus meeting was held between the translators and two main investigators. the original and two back-translated versions were compared and discordances were debated. the final version of the Korean NMIBC24 questionnaire is available online. linguistically validated QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaire was self-administered to patients at prespecified time points. post-TURBT questionnaires were done before follow-up cystoscopy at approximately 30 minutes after local analgesics intramuscular injection. 240 patients (for 24 items) were considered adequate for this study. known-group comparisons were used to determine the ability of the questionnaire to discriminate between subgroups of patients differing in known clinical status. Known groups used for these comparisons were KPS scores ( 90 vs. 90 vs. 100) and sex (male vs. female), and analysis of co-variance (ANOVA) and Student\u2019s t test was used to determine statistical significance, respectively. refusal (yr) 66.713 Sex, male 211 (84.7) Height, meanSD (cm) 1658.4 Weight, meanSD (kg) 65.611.9 Recurrent 79 (31.7) Tumor size > 3 cm 47 (18.9) Multiple 147 (59) Shape, papillary 228 (91.6) Tumor stage Ta 155 (62.2) T1 47 (18.9) Tis only 5 (2.0) Ta with Tis 23 (9.2) T1 with Tis 19 (7.6) Tu sexually active during the past 4 weeks, and female sexual problem scale. when limited to those who reported at least a little sexual activity at the each time point, response rate was around 75%. 0.0 100.0 2 (1.4) 103 (72) 2 (1.4) Sexual function Visit 1 249 23.025.7 0.0 100.0 26 (10.4) 104 (46.6) 2 (0.9) Visit 2 172 18.923.8 0.0 100.0 3 (1.7) 86 (50.9) 4 (2.4) Visit 3 145 18.523.3 0.0 100.0 7 (4.8) 75 (54.3) 1 (0.7) Male sexual problem Visit 1 211 37.434.9 0.0 100.0 19 (9) 53 (27.6) male sexual problem showed highest mean score (33.3 to 37.4) and malaise (8.3 to 14.1) and bloating and flatulence symptom scales scores (9.1 to 13.6) showed lowest mean scores. most items correlated higher with their own scale than with other scales.
