{"summary": "stress granules are generated when conditions of cellular stress result in the inhibition of mRNA translation initiation. these foci contain stalled pre-initiation complexes consisting of small, but not large, ribosomal subunits, mRNA, and canonical translation initiation factors. RNA binding proteins have been proposed to be required for the formation of stress granules. al domain of the protein has been shown to be a dominant negative inhibitor of stress granule assembly. some viruses induce stress granule formation as a way to down-regulate host cell translation. poliovirus infection can induce typical stress granules, which contain TIA-1, translation initiation factors, mRNA, and RNA binding proteins. later in infection the granules are atypical, and still contain TIA-1. poliovirus infection causes a dramatic nucleo-cytoplasmic re-localization of cellular splicing factor SRp20. poliovirus infection causes a dramatic nucleo-cytoplasmic re-localization of cellular splicing factor SRp20. stress granule formation has been shown to be among the many subcellular changes induced by poliovirus infection. the formation of stress granules is not known precisely how stress granules affect poliovirus infection. expression of an altered version of a key stress granule component (G3BP) that is resistant to cleavage by the poliovirus 3C proteinase resulted in an eight-fold reduction in viral titer. in this study we sought to further define the role of stress granule formation during poliovirus infection. SK-N-SH cells were grown as monolayers in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (NCS) COS cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. pEGFP and pEGFP-SRp20 plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Roz Sandri-Goldin. oxidative stress was induced via the addition of 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (Sigma) cells were stressed for 30 min or 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, washed once with 1 PBS. cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. poliovirus infection and [35S]-methionine-labeling of viral proteins COS cells were seeded and allowed to grow to approximately 70% confluency. cells were harvested every 2 h from the beginning of infection, from 0 to 8 h post-infection. SK-N-SH cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (NCS) COS cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. pEGFP and pEGFP-SRp20 plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Roz Sandri-Goldin. the pMT2, pMT2-HA-TIA-1, and pMT2-HA-TIA-1-PRD plasmi media was replaced and oxidative stress was induced via the addition of 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (Sigma) cells were stressed for 30 min or 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, washed once with 1 PBS and processed for imaging. cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. poliovirus infection and [35S]-methionine-labeling of viral proteins COS cells were seeded and allowed to grow to approximately 70% confluency. cells were harvested every 2 h from the beginning of infection, from 0 to 8 h post-infection. the endogenous protein re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during poliovirus infection. we have previously demonstrated that overexpression of GFP-tagged SRp20 does not affect the kinetics of poliovirus infection. we have also carried out experiments using a monoclonal antibody to label endogenous SRp20. SK-N-SH cells have a more distinct cytoplasmic space compared to other cell types (e.g., HeLa cells) cells were labeled with an anti-TIA-1 antibody to identify stress granules. TIA-1 was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells. during infection we observed TIA-1 positive puncta in the cytoplasm. additional experiments confirmed the co-localization of SRp20 and TIA-1 in some, but not all, TIA-1 positive cytoplasmic foci. SRp20 punctate pattern of localization during poliovirus infection. SK-N-SH cells (A) or HeLa cells (B) were transfected with GFP-SRp20. at 3 h post-infection cells were fixed and incubated with an anti-TIA-1 monoclonal antibody. cells were examined for co-localization of TIA-1 with SRp20 or with GFP (B) using confocal microscopy. nuclei were identified by DAPI staining; nuclei were identified by DAPI staining. after 30 min of stress treatment, TIA-1-containing stress granules were apparent in the cytoplasm of the cells. SRp20 remained localized in the nucleus of the arsenite-stressed cells. thus, SRp20 does not localize to TIA-1-containing stress granules formed during conditions of oxidative stress. a portion of the cytoplasmic SRp20 is aggregated in stress granules during infection. disruption of stress granules during infection may boost levels of poliovirus translation. we hypothesized that disruption of stress granules during infection may boost levels of poliovirus translation. minant negative HA-tagged TIA-1-PRD was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of mock-treated cells. after arsenite treatment, HA-TIA-1-PRD was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and no authentic stress granule formation was observed. SK-N-SH cells were either mock-stressed or stressed with sodium arsenite. we transfected COS cells with HA-TIA-1 or HA-TIA-1-PRD. after 2 h of methionine starvation, [35S]-methionine was added to radiolabel the viral proteins produced. every 2 h cells were harvested and lysed. expression of wild type TIA-1 appeared to just slightly decrease the levels of viral proteins produced. cells were harvested every 2 h from the beginning of infection, from 0 to 8 h post-infection (hpi) lymphates were generated and subjected to SDS-PAGE; radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. lanes 9\u201313, cells transfected with TIA-1-PRD expression vector and mock-infected (M); lanes 9\u201313, cells transfected with TIA-1-PRD expression vector and poliovirus-infected for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. it should be noted that lanes 3,4 and 9,10 in gel images are blank because cells were initially infected with poliovirus in methionine-free media. endogenous protein re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during poliovirus infection. transfection of the GFP-tagged version of the protein provided the advantage of a consistent signal from the GFP fluorescence. a portion of the protein could be seen forming granule-like clusters. SRp20 was predominantly nuclear in mock-infected cells but re-localized to the cytoplasm during poliovirus infection. TIA-1 was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of mock- and poliovirus-infected cells. during infection we observed TIA-1 positive puncta in the cytoplasm, consistent with stress granule formation. SK-N-SH cells (A) or HeLa cells (B) were transfected with GFP-SRp20. cells were fixed at 3 h post-infection and imaged. SRp20 localization was determined using confocal microscopy. nuclei were identified by DAPI staining. SRp20 localized to stress granules formed during conditions of oxidative stress. we then labeled the cells with anti-TIA-1 antibody. oxidative stress was carried out for 30 min or for 1 h prior to cell fixation. SK-N-SH cells were either mock-stressed (top panels in A and B) or stressed with sodium arsenite (final concentration 0.5 mM; bottom panels in A and B) for 30 min (A) or 1 h (B) at 37 \u00b0C. expression of wild type or dominant negative TIA-1 does not stimulate or inhibit poliovirus translation. SK-N-SH cells were transfected with HA-tagged wild type TIA-1 or TIA-1-PRD. wild type TIA-1 or dominant negative TIA-1-PRD was localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in mock-treated cells. after arsenite treatment, HA-TIA-1-PRD was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. cells were examined for the formation of stress granules via fluorescence microscopy. we then determined the effect of expressing wild type or dominant negative TIA-1 (or vector alone) on poliovirus translation via [35S]-methionine-labeling of viral proteins during infection. expression of wild type TIA-1 appeared to just slightly decrease levels of viral proteins produced (lanes 8\u201313) compared to empty vector (lanes 2\u20137) neither wild type TIA-1 nor dominant negative TIA-1-PRD expression resulted in a dramatic difference in poliovirus translation. lanes 3\u20137, cells transfected with pMT2 (vector alone) and poliovirus-infected for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. lanes 9\u201313, cells transfected with TIA-1 expression vector and mock-infected. lanes 3,4 and 9,10 in gel images are blank because cells were initially infected with poliovirus in methionine-free media. cellular stressors can induce the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules. these foci contain specific proteins required for their formation, stalled translation complexes, and mRNPs. stress granules formed early in infection contain some proteins and mRNAs. the partial co-localization with TIA-1 suggests that SRp20 is found in some of the unique stress granules that form during poliovirus infection. it is not clear why SRp20 is only localized to a subset of TIA-1-containing stress granules that form during poliovirus infection. poliovirus infection provides another example for differences that exist in stress granule composition. poliovirus infection directs the nucleo-cytoplasmic redistribution of some nuclear proteins, including SRp20. stress granule formation is actively directed by poliovirus infection. it is not clear if stress granules aid or impede the viral infection itself. one study examined the effect of maintaining an uncleavable version of G3BP in virus-induced stress granules. stress granule formation during poliovirus infection may actually contribute to a temporal shift from high levels of viral translation to increasing levels of RNA replication. such a shift has been previously ascribed to viral-mediated cleavage of ITAFs during the course of infection."}
