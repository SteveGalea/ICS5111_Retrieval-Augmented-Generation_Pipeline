{"summary": "no reliable biomarkers are currently available for accurate early detection of ARDS in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit. results Of 178 patients recruited from participating hospitals in Beijing, 75 developed ARDS. ARDS is associated with several clinical disorders, including direct pulmonary injury from pneumonia and aspiration and extra-pulmonary injury from sepsis, trauma, and multiple transfusions. there are currently no reliable predictive markers for early detection of ARDS in predisposed individuals. a prospectively enrolled cohort study in multicenter ICUs is suitable for more complete and unbiased ARDS/ALI research [14]. a prospectively enrolled cohort study in multicenter ICUs is suitable for more complete and unbiased ARDS/ALI research. subjects were defined as critically ill patients with at least one predisposing condition for ARDS: 1) sepsis; 2) septic shock; 3) trauma; 4) pneumonia; 5) aspiration; 6) massive transfusion of red blood cells (PRBC; defined as >8 PRBC units during the 24 hours prior to admission); or 7) severe pancreatitis. controls were identified as at-risk patients who did not meet criteria for ARDS during the ICU stay. infiltrates on chest radiographs were defined as opacities that could not be explained completely by pleural effusions, mass, body habitus, or collapse. upper zone redistribution and pulmonary vascular congestion were not considered infiltrates. wise elimination algorithm used log-rank test as a univariate measure of association. the final logistic regression models included predictors from backward elimination. subjects were followed daily for the development of ARDS, as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference. subjects were followed daily for the development of ARDS, as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference. data by chart review included demographic information of age, gender, race, height, weight and medical history of ARDS, diabetes, tobacco and alcohol abuse, and liver disease. all enrolled patients were followed until one of the following situations occurred: hospital discharge, death, or 60 days after study entry. the majority of patients were male (n = 125, 70%) and the mean age was 63 years. median length of time in the ICU was 10.5 days (interquartile range: 5\u201317 days) n (%) 26 (25.2) 28 (37.3) 0.07 Albumin,25 g/dL, n (%) 25 (61) 16 (39) 0.57 Arterial pH,7.33, n (%) 35 (35) 28 (37.3) 0.74 Arterial pH,7.22, n (%) 4 (3.9) 7 (9.3) 0.14 Comorbidities, n (%) Diabetes 23 (22.3) 16 (21.3) 0.87 Predisposing conditions for ARDS, n (%) Sep patients with both direct and external pulmonary injuries were considered to have direct lung injury. ARDS development During hospitalization, 75 (41%) patients developed ARDS. there were no significant differences in age, gender, smoking status, and initial APACHE II score between ARDS and at-risk non-ARDS patients. APACHE II score (removing age and gender components), age, and gender were forced in as covariates, but not significant in logistic regression analyses. a stratified analysis found that thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with ARDS in both the Beijing cohort (univariate analysis, p = 0.01) and the Boston cohort (univariate analysis, p0.0001). the thrombocytopenia was defined by the lowest platelet counts during the first 24 hours of ICU admission in the Beijing cohort and 40% in the Boston cohort. we then performed a nested analysis on a clean subgroup patients, by removing ARDS patients who were diagnosed during the first 24 hours of ICU admission. thrombocytopenia was still significantly associated with ARDS risk. pancreatitis was associated with decreased mortality (p = 0.014) in non-ARDS patients. pneumonia (p = 0.002) and external pulmonary injury (p = 0.013) had higher mortality rates in non-ARDS patients. >2.0 mg/L 22 9 (41) 27 37 20 (54) 12 Bilirubin 0.895 0.296 0.45 2.0 mg/dL 53 23 (43) 24 59 20 (34) 42 >2.0 mg/dL 21 8 (38) 11 35 14 (10) 11 Thrombocytopenia 0.022 0.436 0.024 Platelet >80109/L 46 15 (33) 34 77 27 (35) 19 Platelet 80109/L 28 16 (57) 9 26 11 (42) 21 Albumin 0. aspiration 0.92 0.434 0.856 No aspiration 65 27 (42) 24 101 38 (38) 19 Aspiration 10 4 (40) 7 2 0 (0) - Pulmonary injury 0.812 0.003 0.013 Direct pulmonary injury 36 14 (39) 17 67 19 (28) 42 External pulmonary injury 39 17 (44) 29 36 19 (53) 12 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome. penia was a mortality covariate for ARDS and all patients, but not for non-ARDS patients. thrombocytopenia remained associated with higher mortality in ARDS. multivariate analyses identified APACHE II score and thrombocytopenia as major risk factors for mortality in ARDS, non-ARDS, and all patients. the combination of thrombocytopenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had consistently higher patient mortality. survival analyses show Kaplan-Meier curves of thrombocytopenia and ARDS development on 60-day mortality among critically ill patients at-risk for ARDS. in the Beijing cohort (upper panel, p = 0.05) and the Boston cohort (lower panel, p0.0001) adjusted hazard ratios of thrombocytopenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on 60-day mortality among critically ill patients at-risk for ARDS. let counts100103/L& ARDS: AHR = 3.03; 95% CI = 1.55\u20135.93; p = 0.001) table 4.
