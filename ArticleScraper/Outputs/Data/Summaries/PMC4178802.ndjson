{"summary": "betacoronaviruses belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus within the subfamily Coronavirinae. the genetic diversity of CoVs in bats exceeds that known for any other host. in 2002 to 2003, an emerging HCoV, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), caused a pandemic involving about 8,000 cases. clade c betacoronaviruses representing another clade c Betacoronavirus species were recently described in hedgehogs (16). we characterized small genomic sequence fragments of bat CoVs (BtCoVs) that were closely related to MERS-CoV. the evolutionary relationship of these bat CoVs with MERS-CoV could not be conclusively defined (20, 21) primer sequences and PCR conditions are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. these assays were designed to amplify about 800 overlapping base pairs of all known MERS-CoV sequences. a fecal specimen from a Neoromicia bat from south africa was sampled and tested positive for CoVs. these assays were designed to amplify about 800 overlapping base pairs of all known MERS-CoV sequences. Genomic fragments that could not be amplified by these assays were connected by bridging RT-PCR using NeoCoV-specific primers. determination of genome ends was done by using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) the full NeoCoV genome sequence was obtained directly from fecal material stored in RNAlater. this genome contained 30,100 nt excluding the poly(A) tail, with a G/C content of 40%. this was comparable to MERS-CoV strains which range in size from 30,100 to 30,107 nt and have a G/C content of 41%. the genome is represented by a black line; ORFs are indicated by gray arrows. locations of transcription regulatory core sequences (TRSs) following the leader are marked by labeled dots and numbered in their order of appearance from the genomic 5\u2032 terminus. 8 putative TRSs with the conserved TRS core motif of clade c betacoronaviruses preceded predicted ORFs. the predicted leader TRS core sequence of NeoCoV (TTAACGAACT) and the predicted body TRS core sequences of NeoCoV were completely identical to those of MERS-CoVs. no separate body TRSs preceding predicted AUG codons of ORF4b and ORF8b were detected. no amino acids Sequencea % amino acid identityb of BtCoV/Neoromicia/PML-PHE1/RSA/2011. 499 27818GGGTTTAACGAACTCCTT27835 93.6\u201394.5 81.7\u201382.2 82.6\u201383.1 80.7\u201381.2 N 28557\u201329801 414 28528GATCTTAACGAATCTTAA28545 91.3\u201391.7 76.5\u201376.8 76.0 72.7\u201373.0 ORF8b 28603\u201329202 199 81.1\u201383.9. the established Betacoronavirus clade c species HKU4 and HKU5 and hedgehog CoV shared 85.3 to 88.7% amino acid sequence identity with MERS-CoVs from humans and camels as well as NeoCoV. this substantiated the classification of MERS-CoV as a separate species. c Including GenBank accession numbers EF065505, EF065509, EF065510, EF065511, and EF065512. e Including GenBank accession numbers KC545383 and KC545386. to analyze the relationships of NeoCoV with MERS-CoV and other clade c betacoronaviruses, full-genome comparisons were made. these identity levels exceed those between any other clade c betacoronavirus and MERS-CoV by 2- to 3-fold. this includes ORF4a, which acts as an interferon antagonist. the 23 amino acid positions suggested to form a double-stranded RNA-binding domain in the MERS-CoV 4a protein (29) were completely conserved in NeoCoV. monophyly correlated with a higher degree of amino acid sequence identity (87.2%) between MERS-CoV and NeoCoV in the S2 subunit. phylogenies of the S1 and S2 subunits corresponding to amino acid positions 1 to 747 and 748 to 1353, respectively, of MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012. the human-pathogenic MERS-CoV variant may be the result of nonrecent recombination events involving as-yet-unknown partners. these data suggest that the human-pathogenic MERS-CoV variant might be the result of nonrecent recombination events involving as-yet-unknown partners. the different S1 subunits of HCoV-229E and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been interpreted as further evidence for the interchangeability of spike subunits (30). the different S1 subunit suggested NeoCoV was not the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. this scenario parallels the spike gene diversity found in bat CoV ancestors of SARS-CoV. genomes from camels and MERS-CoV genomes from humans clustered with high statistical support in basal sister relationship to MERS-CoVs from humans and camels from the Arabian Peninsula. the maximum nucleotide distance within MERS-CoVs from camels was 0.6%. only 11 near-full-length genomes are available for MERS-CoVs from camels, compared to 38 near-full-length genomes for MERS-Co the majority of camels in the Arabian Peninsula are imported from countries in the Greater Horn of Africa (11, 12) a hypothetical scenario might thus imply a spillover of viruses from bats to camels in the Greater Horn of Africa. the putative ancient recombination events giving rise to MERS-CoV may have taken place in two candidate hosts to be explored. the first option is vespertilionid bats. it would be highly relevant to fully characterize additional bat viruses from africa and the Arabian Peninsula."}
