{"summary": "a functional M2 channel protein plays a key role in virus replication and regulates virus morphology. the two adamantane derivative-based drugs amantadine and rimantadine were the first-choice antivirals licensed for effective against influenza A viruses. since 2003, the frequency of amantadine resistance has increased significantly, from less than 5% to greater than 90% of isolated influenza A virus. the high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy structure by Schnell and Chou has successfully provided a full-length structure of H3N2 M2 channel protein. the 3D 2009-H1N1 M2 channel protein [15] built from sequence with the Genbank accession number of GQ385303 was also used. possible binding sites with M2 channel proteins H3N2 2009-H1N1 H3N2 2009-H1N1 Inside Amantadine 6.85 7.01 Hydrogen bond with Ala30 No Hydrogen bond Inside Rimantadine 7.75 7.57 Hydrogen bond with Ala30 No Hydrogen bond Hydrophobic interaction with Ile33 Outside Amantadine 5.03 5.05 Hydrogen bond with Asp44 Outside Rimantadine 5.53 4.92 Hydrogen bond with Asp 200 compounds were divided into 7 groups based on the structure similarity. their free energy of binding of 200 compounds to both H3N2 and 2009-H1N1 M2 channel proteins is shown in the Table 2. 81 5.80 Group 3 from [21] 1a 8.70 8.48 6.04 6.11 1b 9.46 8.91 6.49 5.51 1c 9.39 8.89 6.55 3.04 1d 9.20 9.62 4.71 2.60 1e 8.99 9.81 4.45 0.30 1f 8.73 8.54 5.45 5.01 1g 9.91 9.80 5.32 2.52 1h 9.53 9.07 4.62 0.15 1i 10.29 10.02 7.33 6.72 2a 10.47 10.14 5.79 3.63 2b 10. 1 5.63 M4 9.05 8.87 5.85 5.81 M5 8.60 8.23 5.56 5.64 M6 8.47 8.95 3.62 4.76 M7 8.21 7.97 5.53 5.23 M8 8.65 7.95 5.97 5.53 5.23 M9 9.14 9.20 4.91 5.88 M10 8.47 8.25 5.05 5.06 TaM11 8.44 8.00 5.62 4.10 M12 9.38 9.59 9.59 5.03 5.97 M13 9.42 9.31 4.16 5.89 M14 6.73 6. anin(EUB) 8.54 8.51 +1.71 +3.06 Vanillinbananin(VBN) 8.70 9.22 4.58 4.74 Group 5 from [24] D1 8.48 8.26 5.38 5.06 D2 7.83 7.94 5.58 5.20 D3 7.38 6.91 4.27 3.86 D4 7.46 7.29 5.69 5.53 D5 8.01 7.93 5.61 5.70 D6 7.79 7.59 7.59 5.17 5.15 D7 8.54 8.27 5.72 5.60 9.87 5.42 4.82 N6 10.44 10.31 5.55 3.69 N7 10.15 10.70 5.54 5.25 N8 7.37 7.06 5.22 4.77 N9 8.50 7.58 5.50 5.06 N10 8.83 8.50 5.18 5.23 N11 9.24 8.97 5.25 5.36 N12 9.53 9.34 5.94 6.46 N13 10.49 10.41 5.76 5.29 N14 12.25 12.10 6.68 3.99 N15 10.98 10.12 5.68 4.78 N16 12.50 12.13 6. 9.85 8.42 5.27 5.05 10 9.35 8.97 5.59 5.35 11 9.23 9.51 6.17 6.96 12 10.59 10.11 7.13 6.92 13 10.51 10.28 6.73 7.62 14 11.21 10.61 7.13 7.30 15 10.67 10.46 6.49 7.68 16 11.22 10.84 7.25 7.50 17 8.04 8.23 5.36 5.18 18 8.80 8.00 6.37 6.03 19 9.16 9.47 6.17 6.95 20 9.67 9.67 6.12 6.73 21 10.00 10.50 5 37 5.62 35 10.00 10.23 5.69 5.71 37 8.78 9.17 5.53 5.63 38 9.45 8.43 5.86 5.89 39 9.18 8.77 5.32 5.40 40 8.53 8.13 5.58 5.25 41 9.10 8.78 5.55 5.56 42 9.61 9.25 9.25 5.71 5.73 43 9.42 9.01 5.26 5.04 44 9.07 9.14 5.01 5.55 45 9.51 9.55 3.97 5.73 46 9.63 9.81 3.46 5.69 47 9.90 10.25 3.53 5.59 4.59 5.69 62 9.50 9.15 4.04 5.33 63 9.88 9.55 3.69 4.42 64 10.15 10.49 3.49 3.72 65 9.03 8.74 5.55 5.90 66 9.46 9.27 4.12 5.28 67 10.06 9.72 4.47 3.54 68 9.92 9.78 4.13 5.56 69 10.31 10.19 3.75 4.61 70 10.62 10.38 3.57 4.70 71 8.30 7.81 5.66 5.55 72 8.60 8.11 4.77 4.77 73 8. 87 7.91 7.15 6.62 5.94 88 6.94 6.63 5.34 4.58 89 7.23 6.82 5.37 4.59 90 9.23 9.04 6.38 5.84 91 7.16 7.02 5.26 5.16 92 7.40 7.65 5.69 5.22 93 7.41 7.01 5.45 4.74 94 7.67 7.39 5.57 4.91 95 8.86 9.15 5.65 5.72 96 8.00 7.62 5.23 4.88 97 8.66 8.92 5.16 5.90 98 8.90 9. inside Ranking Comp. top 10 binding compounds (inside M2 channel protein) Free energy of binding (kcal/mol) Outside Ranking Comp. top 10 binding compounds (outside M2 channel protein) binding on the outside channel basically binds with lower affinity through hydrogen bonds with Asp44 in every compound in either of the M2 protein types. both compounds I5 and I9 are identical to O9 and O3 respectively (cf.

Figure 3). a five features hypothesis was generated from the I5 outside the M2 channel complex. the I9 produced a four features hypothesis consisting of one HBA and three H groups with nine excluded volume spheres. the HBA group pointed towards the Asp44 while the H groups pointed towards Arg45 and Leu46. the results suggest that these residues are extremely important binding sites for novel M2 channel inhibitors. common pharmacophore features of top 10 inside binding (A) and outside binding (B) compounds. Hydrogen Bond Acceptor (HBA) presented as green vectored spheres. the design principle of potential target drug-resistant influenza A on M2 mutants aimed to introduce an additional functional group on the aamantadine scaffold. the scaffold was based on the adamantyl group and selection of suitable functional groups attaching to the scaffold to form new compounds that will potentially bind well to M2 channel proteins at the key residues in the binding site. the positive control for docking was obtained by re-docking amantadine and rimantadine extracted from the NMR structure [14] to locate the binding site on M2 channel proteins. the binding box inside M2 channel proteins was positioned to encompass all three possible binding sites. the binding box outside M2 channel proteins was set up to cover two important functional residues. top ten bound compounds were selected based on the lowest free energy of binding for pharmacophore analysis. pharmacophore modeling studies were carried out using the LigandScout 3.01 and HipHop module of Discovery Studio 2.5 software. the most important inside interactions that can hold and stabilize the drug inside the M2 channel proteins were selected and visualised. the significance of pharmacophore models mostly depends on the quality of the molecule structures used in generation of the pharmacophore conformation. the M2 model construction of the 2009-H1N1 virus was the high-resolution NMR structure of M2 channel protein (PDB code of 2RLF) most synthetic inhibitors of M2 channel proteins, amantadine scaffolds based on adamantane derivatives were selected from published work. two types of M2 channel proteins representing H3N2 and 2009-H1N1 virus strains were used as receptor with two different docking positions inside and outside the channel. autodock tools version 1.5.4 [30] was used to add polar hydrogens, assign Kollman charges and create grid binding boxes. ligand set includes 200 new M2 inhibitors created from previously published studies. autoDockTools 1.5.4 was used to merge nonpolar hydrogens, add charges and visually set up rotatable bonds for each ligand via AutoTors. the top ten compounds binding on the inside and outside of the M2 channel proteins with the lowest binding energy were used to generate the structure-based pharmacophore models. the top ten compounds binding on the inside and outside of the M2 channel proteins with the lowest binding energy were used to generate the structure-based pharmacophore models. training set molecule was selected from two different groups. top 10 compounds binding inside the M2 channel proteins and top 10 compounds binding outside the M2 channel proteins. ligand interactions with critical amino acids present in the active site of M2 channel proteins were verified. ligand-receptor interactions include hydrogen bond, charge transfer, hydrophobic regions of their macromolecular environment. chemical features include hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors as directed vectors, positive and negative ionizable areas and lipophilic areas represented by spheres. eighteen hypotheses were generated in the outside group. seventeen hypotheses were created in the inside group. the best hypothesis from each group was selected based on the high number of compounds fitting it as well as the high fit value of the hypothesis."}
