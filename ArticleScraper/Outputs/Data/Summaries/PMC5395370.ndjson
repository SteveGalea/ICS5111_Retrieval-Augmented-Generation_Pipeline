{"summary": "toc risk factors should always include an evaluation of relevant travel history, taking into account both domestic and international travel. international travel is more likely to be associated with uncommon or emerging febrile illness, as well as childhood vaccine-preventable diseases mostly eradicated in Canada. even travel within Canada might expose a patient to pathogens not native to their home region. family physicians should check for travel health advisories issued for destinations on the patient\u2019s itinerary. health care workers accounted for more than 40% of SARS infections during the Toronto outbreak9; and in the EVD epidemic, both health care and funeral workers were at increased risk of infection. exposures to spores of Histoplasma capsulatum may be more likely in occupations. agricultural environments can be reservoirs for zoonoses, including avian influenza, Q fever, histoplasmosis, psittacosis, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. contact tracing is critical component of global health security. the cause of the patient\u2019s illness came into focus only after health officials connected his grandmother\u2019s travel history with a recent outbreak of a mysterious respiratory illness in mainland China. international travel is more likely to be associated with uncommon or emerging febrile illness, as well as childhood vaccine-preventable diseases mostly eradicated in Canada. even travel within Canada might expose a patient to pathogens not native to their home region. family physicians should check for travel health advisories issued for destinations on the patient\u2019s itinerary. family physicians should also establish what diseases are endemic to areas the patient visited. malaria, dengue, or chikungunya are the most common causes of febrile illnesses in returning international travelers. international humanitarian workers might contract infections rarely seen in Canada. agricultural environments can be reservoirs for zoonoses, including avian influenza, Q fever, histoplasmosis, psittacosis, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. contact tracing is critical component of global health security. the cause of the patient\u2019s illness came into focus only after health officials connected his grandmother\u2019s travel history with a recent outbreak of a mysterious respiratory illness in mainland China. the TOC algorithm is a practical risk assessment tool appropriate for use both at the time of booking (to identify probable infectious cases that warrant additional precautions) the family physician should treat the patient as a probable case. toc risk factors to patients who present with fever or ARI might prevent the spread of the next emerging infection."}
