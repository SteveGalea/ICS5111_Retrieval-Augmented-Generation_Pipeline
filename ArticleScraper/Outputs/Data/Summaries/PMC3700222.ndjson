{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a strictly hepatotropic DNA virus affecting about 350 million people worldwide, especially in Asia. inflammatory cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, chemokines, and platelets play a critical pathogenic role in HBV infection. mutations within T cell-directed epitopes are one of the most common strategies employed by viruses to evade immune detection. mutations in T cell-immunodominant epitopes are associated with higher rates of liver fibrosis and development of HCC (22), which may be due to inefficient T cell responses. CHB patients were defined as those who had chronic HBV infection with serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity for >6 months. they may have shown symptoms of hepatitis or abnormal hepatic function. CHB-M patients display mild to moderate liver disease activities. patients with HBcL60V variation 16 (11.0) 24 (22.6) 31 (25.4) 0.01 No. of HBV DNA copies/ml Mean 2.5 107 1.1 107 1.2 107 >0.05 Range 1,282\u20131.6 109 500\u20132.6 108 500\u20135.3 108 Mean SD concn (IU/liter) ALT 145.8 218.6 457.0 382.3 258.5 394.0 0.01 AST 101.8 120.5 297.4 280.0 307.9 446.3 0. all patients were negative for hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and HIV-1 infection. blood samples (10 ml) were collected from each of the patients. all patients had been hospitalized in the Beijing 302 Hospital. the truncated forms of HBc were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and designated pcDNA3.1-HBc149-L60 and pcDNA3.1-HBc149-V60. pHBV1.3 containing 1.3 copies of the full-length HBV genomic sequence was maintained in the lab. the sequences were compared and used for peptide synthesis. the HBc18-27 (FLPSDFFPSV) and HBc82-90 (RELVVSYVN) peptides were used as positive and negative controls. the H-2 Kd-restricted epitope HBc87-95 (SYVNTNMGL) was synthesized as another positive control. two human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Huh-7) and the 293T cell line were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) the cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HBc V60 crystals were obtained at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml in bis-Tris (pH 6.5) and 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3350. ELISPOT assay was performed to detect epitope-specific T cells. 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride plates were precoated overnight at 4\u00b0C. HBc149-L60 or pET-HBc149-V60 vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. the recombinant HBc proteins were expressed and purified as described previously. the assembled capsids were detected by native agarose gel electrophoresis as previously described. the accession number of the structure of V60-pMHC in the Protein Data Bank is 4K7F. the association between the HBc L60V variation and the progression of liver disease or patients' clinical indicators were investigated. TBIL level >10 times the normal level (171 mol/liter) and PTA of 40% (23). clinical characteristics of all enrolled patients are described in Table 1. Table 1. Clinical and virologic characteristics of CHB-M, CHB-S, and ACLF patients. a total of 19 acute hepatitis B (AHB) and 25 CHB patients were enrolled. all patients were negative for hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and HIV-1 infection. all F1 hybrids were screened for serum HBsAg by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), viral DNA by real-time PCR, and HLA-A2 by PCR amplification with sequence-specific primers. the study of mice was in strict accordance with the regulations of the institute of microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences of Research Ethics Committee. overlapping method (8-amino-acid [aa] overlap) synthesized 191 nonapeptides (9-mers) covering HBc aa 1 to 150. an additional 13 peptides (8- to 10-mers) associated with the candidate peptides evaluated in this study are listed in Table 2. if FI is 1, the peptide is marked +. Otherwise, it is marked. cell culture and transfection were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines. the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and 2 microglobulin (2m) were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (26) and refolded using the gradual dilution method (27) the soluble portion of the refolded complex was concentrated and purified by Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration chromatography. the same immunization strategy was performed with HLA-A2.1/HBV transgenic mice and HBV transgenic BALB/c mice. each group contained five to seven HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice. 293T cells or HepG2 cells transfected with pHBV1.3 or pHBV1.3-HBcL60V were labeled with 2 M carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester as target cells and seeded into a 96-well plate. target cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) using a Vybrant apoptosis assay kit. alkaline phosphatase-labeled HBV DNA was generated using an amersham AlkPhos direct labeling and detection system. core particles associated with HBV DNA from cell supernatants were quantified by real-time PCR as previously described. positive-control HBV peptide HBc18-27 showed a high affinity (FI = 3.9) negative-control HBc82-90 peptide had an FI for affinity of 0.04. only the decapeptides ILCWGELMNL and its variant, IVCWGELMNL, could moderately increase the surface level of HLA-A*0201 molecules. the peaks of HLA complexes with the expected molecular mass of 45 kDa eluted at the estimated volume of 15.9 ml. mAU, milli-absorbance units (C) V60 is presented in the peptide-binding clefts with electron density at the 1 contour level. the heavy chain of HLA-A*0201 is show in cyan surfaces. anchor residues play an important role in the stability of the entire complex. the side chains of amino acids E5 and M7 protrude out from the HLA-A2 surface. the longer side chain of L1 pointing away from the HLA-A2 surface prevents C2 from properly inserting into pocket B. the structure with PDB accession number 1QRN has a Leu at position 2 in pocket B. this may indicate that (i) the large S atom of C2 in the V60 peptide requires more space or (ii) L1 may be correlated with a smaller B pocket. a significant difference in the antiviral cytotoxicity of CTLs was observed between mice immunized with L60 peptide and those immunized with V60 peptide. a much higher specific CTL response was observed in patients infected with the HBc L60V variants than infected with wild-type HBV. 293T cells labeled with CFSE were transfected with pHBV1.3 or pHBV1.3-HBcL60V as target cells and mixed with L60-, V60-, or HBc18-27-stimulated splenocytes. after 4 h, mixed samples were stained with PI and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. HBc L60V variant-infected patients with higher ALT levels showed much higher V60-specific CTL activity than those infected with wild-type isolates. the prevalence of the L60V variation increased with the disease progression in HBV-infected patients. PBMCs were collected from patients with serum ALT levels of >40 IU/liter. HBc82-90 peptide served as a negative control for background evaluation. Pearson's 2 test was used to determine P values. HBc V60 DNA- and V60 peptide-treated mice showed 50% greater serum ALT activity. the number of SFCs with reactivity to V60 increased by 5-fold in V60-immunized mice. similar results were observed by the cytotoxicity assay of splenocytes. HBc18-27 and HBc18-27 were transfected with pHBV1.3 or pHBV1.3-HBcL60V as target cells. splenocytes from immunized mice were stimulated with the DNA prime/peptide boost formula as described in the text. the data show the means SDs of five mice. Huh7 cells were transfected with pHBV1.3 or pHBV1.3-HBcL60V. secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg was detected by ELISA at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection. rcDNA, relaxed circulated HBV DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded HBV DNA; and ssDNA, single-stranded HBV DNA. ified core particles were assembled in vitro. the levels of total core protein were used as a loading control. data are representative of two independent experiments. a dramatic increase in capsid assembly was observed for HBcV60 compared to HBcL60. the leucine-to-valine mutation at position 60 of HBc has a major effect on capsid assembly. a variant peptide (V60, VCWGELMNL) showed a high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201 molecules. a refolding assay was performed to further investigate the binding affinity of the V60 and L60 peptides. the V60 peptide possessed a high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201, whereas L60 did not. the heavy chain of HLA-A*0201/V60 is shown in cyan surfaces. the large S atom (yellow sphere) of V60 is shown in the B pocket. a complex of HLA-A2 and V60 was prepared for crystallization. we compared the structure of the HLA-A*0201-V60 complex and the previously determined structure with PDB accession number 1QRN. pocket B in the structure with PDB accession number 1QRN is smaller than that in HLA-A*0201-V60, although the structure with PDB accession number 1QRN has a Leu at position 2 in pocket B. female HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice were immunized with an HBc DNA prime/peptide boost regimen three times with heat shock protein gp96 as the adjuvant. a peptide-specific CTL response to L60 or V60 was detected by ELISPOT assay 1 week after the last immunization. the data indicate that 60V is an HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope. female HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice were immunized with a DNA prime/peptide boost regimen at weeks 1, 3 and 4. PBMCs (2 105/well) from patients infected with wild-type (HBcL60) or variant (HBcV60) virus were stimulated with L60 peptide, V60 peptide, or HBc82-90 or HBc18-27 as negative and positive controls. HBc L60V variation is associated with severe hepatitis and disease progression in HBV-infected patients. HBc L60V variant-infected patients with higher ALT levels showed much higher V60-specific CTL activity than patients with lower ALT levels (80 IU/liter) there were no statistically significant differences in sex and age between patients with the wild-type and variant isolate. Pearson's 2 test was used to determine P values. HBc L60V variation results in liver injury in HLA-A2.1/HBV transgenic mice. similar results were observed by the cytotoxicity assay of splenocytes. HBc L60V variation causes CTL-mediated liver injury in HBV transgenic mice. HBc L60V variation facilitates viral capsid assembly and enhances HBV replication. a leucine-to-valine mutation at HBc position 60 was introduced in the HBV replication vector pHBV1.3. similar results were observed by Southern blotting of HBV replicative intermediates. transgenic mice were hydrodynamically injected with the wild-type or the mutant HBV plasmid. injection of the mutant HBV plasmid resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in HBV DNA load. the number of HBcAg-positive cells in the mutant plasmid-treated mice was greater (about 2-fold) than that in the wild-type plasmid-treated mice. we investigated the effect of the HBc L60V variation site on the expression of HBc and the formation of the core capsid. the HBc L60V variation caused a dramatic increase in viral capsid assembly and enhanced HBV replication. the HBc L60V variation caused a dramatic increase in viral capsid assembly and enhanced HBV replication. a considerable number of epitopes are ignored by these methods (36). e is generated through natural processing by detection of epitope-specific T cells in HBV-infected patients. the HBc L60V variation actually added a new HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cell epitope that was associated with severe hepatitis and disease progression in CHB patients. replacement of leucine by valine, which is more hydrophobic and has a shorter side chain, makes the entire complex more compact, enhances the stability of the HBc capsid, and facilitates the formation of virus particles. currently, it is difficult to distinguish exact roles of the new epitope-specific T cell response and the increased HBV replication in the necroinflammation and pathogenesis of liver disease in patients infected with HBc L60V variants. the HBc L60A mutation blocks virion formation and secretion to undetectable levels but allows nucleocapsid formation. we speculate that the HBc L60V variant may produce subviral naked capsid particles with less infectious virions. the HBc L60V variant may be less infective than its wild-type counterpart. we investigated the clinical significance, variable T cell immune response, and virologic characteristics associated with a hot spot variation (L60V) located in the HBc protein. we demonstrated a unique pattern of virus mutation in favor of viral persistence and necroinflammation."}
