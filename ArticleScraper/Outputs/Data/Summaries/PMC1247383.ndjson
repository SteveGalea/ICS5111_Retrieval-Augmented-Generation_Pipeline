{"summary": "more than 75% of human diseases are zoonotic and have a link to wildlife and domestic animals. agricultural development, urbanization, deforestation, population movement, increasing population, introduction of novel species/pathogens, water and air pollution, biodiversity loss, habit fragmentation, road building, macro and micro climate changes. rates of deforestation have grown exponentially since the beginning of the 20th century. large swaths of species-rich tropical and temperate forests have been converted to species-poor agricultural and ranching areas. global rate of tropical deforestation continues at staggering levels, with nearly 2\u20133% of forests lost globally each year. tropical forests are typically converted into agricultural or grazing lands. this process is usually exacerbated by construction of roads, causing erosion. clear lands and culverts that collect rainwater are in some areas far more suitable for larvae of malaria-transmitting anopheline mosquitoes. adapted to the peridomestic environment, Foxes are not very important reservoirs for leishmaniasis in Latin America. a more important factor in the transmission cycle includes domestic dogs. results suggest that the probability that a tick will become infected depends on density of white-footed mice. measles to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors will continue to rise. human introduction of pathogens, hosts, or materials into new areas has been termed \u201cpathogen pollution\u201d. land use changes drive some of these introductions and migrations. refugees account for a significant number of human migrants, carrying diseases such as hepatitis B and tuberculosis and various parasites. refugees become impoverished and are more exposed to a wide range of health risks. zoonotic pathogens are the most significant cause of EIDs affecting humans. zoonoses also cause diseases that have some of the highest incidence rates globally. the influenza virus is an example, causing pandemics in humans. some species are endemic to both remote oceanic islands and more populous suburban and rural human settlements. agriculture occupies about half of the world\u2019s land and uses more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s fresh water. a rise in soil moisture associated with irrigation development in the southern Nile Delta has caused a rapid rise in the mosquito Culex pipiens. large-scale use of pesticides has had deleterious effects on farm workers. accounts for an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,200 deaths in the united states each year. other dangers include antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as Cyclospora, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and other pathogenic E. coli strains associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome in children. urbanization will increase to an unprecedented 65% by the year 2030. rates of deforestation have grown exponentially since the beginning of the 20th century. large swaths of species-rich tropical and temperate forests have been converted to species-poor agricultural and ranching areas. global rate of tropical deforestation continues at staggering levels. tropical forests are typically converted into agricultural or grazing lands. this process is usually exacerbated by construction of roads. cleared lands and culverts that collect rainwater are in some areas far more suitable for larvae of malaria-transmitting anopheline mosquitoes. the probability that a tick will become infected depends on the density of white-footed mice. the density effect of white-footed mice can be \u201cdiluted\u201d by an increasing density of alternative hosts, which are less efficient at transmitting Lyme disease. deforestation decreases the overall habitat available for wildlife species. it also modifies the structure of environments by fragmenting habitats into smaller patches separated by agricultural activities or human populations. increased activity in forest habitats (through behavior or occupation) appears to be a major risk factor for leishmaniasis. erosion after deforestation adds significant mercury loads to rivers. this has led to fish in the amazon becoming hazardous to eat. habitat fragmentation alters the composition of host species in an environment. gold mining is an extractive industry that damages local and regional environments. mercury accumulates in local fish populations, making them toxic to eat. in gold-mining areas, more mosquito-breeding sites and malaria risk result. alterations in population movements and densities of flying foxes, large fruit bats known to be reservoir for newly emergent zoonosis Nipah virus. increased opportunity for contact between infected bats and pigs produced outbreak of disease in pigs, which then was transmitted to people in contact with infected pigs. monkeypox persisted for four generations via human-to-human contact. some 1,415 species of infectious organisms are known to be pathogenic to people. of the emerging pathogens, 75% are zoonotic, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than are nonzoonotic pathogens. wildlife and domestic animals play a key role in the process by providing a zoonotic pool. fruit bats are involved in a high-profile group of EIDs. some species are endemic to both remote oceanic islands and more populous suburban and rural human settlements. some of the current major infectious threats to human health are EIDs and reemerging infectious diseases. 75% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than are nonzoonotic pathogens. zoonotic pathogens cause a series of EIDs with high case fatality rates and no reliable cure, vaccine, or therapy. some of the current major infectious threats to human health are EIDs and reemerging infectious diseases. many of the currently important human EIDs are driven partly by human-induced changes to wildlife habitat such as encroachment and deforestation. agriculture occupies about half the world\u2019s land and uses more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s fresh water. food safety is an important factor in human health, because food-borne disease accounts for an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,200 deaths in the united states each year. other dangers include antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as Cyclospora, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and other pathogenic strains associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome in children. food safety is an important factor in human health, because food-borne disease accounts for an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,200 deaths in the united states each year. 80% of the population now lives in metropolitan areas, with 30% living in cities of 5 million or more. infectious diseases can pass from people to wildlife. nonhuman primates have acquired measles from ecotourists. drug resistance in gram-negative enteric bacteria of wild baboons. sea turtles worldwide are affected by fibropapillomatosis, a disease probably caused by one or several viruses and characterized by multiple epithelial tumors. this represents the breakdown of the land\u2013water interface, to the point that several pathogens typical of terrestrial ecosystems have become established. the recommendations stemming from the international colloquium are highly relevant to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003) a conceptual framework of the MEA already provides an approach to optimize the contribution of ecosystems to human health. the world health organization (WHO 1997) has developed a similar DPSEEA model. it describes the interlinkage between human health and different driving forces and environmental change. as such understanding increases, it will become more feasible to plan how to prevent new infectious disease emergence. key data include identifying and quantifying the relevant pathogen load of wildlife, livestock, and human communities in fragmented landscapes. the goals of this data collection are, first, to identify key infectious diseases, both chronic and emergent or reemergent. a system of regional- or subregional-based centers of excellence in ecology and health research and training would have the following objectives. the new research agenda must gather information on household and community perspectives about proposals for the use of their land. the new research agenda must gather information on household and community perspectives about the use of their land. research activities would range from taxonomy of pathogens and vectors to identifying best practices for influencing changes in human behavior to reduce ecosystem and health risks. research activities would range from taxonomy of pathogens and vectors to identifying best practices for influencing changes in human behavior to reduce ecosystem and health risks. a conceptual framework of the MEA already provides an approach to optimize the contribution of ecosystems to human health. this framework offers a mechanism to a) identify options that can better achieve human development and sustainable goals. this framework offers a mechanism to a) identify options that can better achieve human development and sustainable goals. land use change can lead to major shifts in infectious disease patterns. in rich and temperate-climate communities, shifts tend to be disease specific. research on deforestation and infectious disease should be pursued. leaking dam may present greater risks than reservoir itself. in the northeastern united states, a superabundance of rodent vectors has led to a superabundance of rodent vectors for Lyme disease. the second component of the research program would involve health impact modeling, primarily in three areas: a) estimating changes in the relative abundance of organisms, including infectious disease vectors, pathogens, and hosts; b) projecting potential vector or transmission shifts. a system of regional- or subregional-based centers of excellence in ecology and health research and training would have the following objectives. the new research agenda must gather information on household and community perspectives about proposals for the use of their land. the new research agenda must gather information about the links between environmental change and public health. research projects should take place in regions or landscapes that have both well characterized and less characterized patterns of infectious disease emergence or transmission for comparison purposes. local health and environment professionals should make the choices within each region for initial research areas and sites. trade-offs are between short-term benefit and long-term damage. draining swamps may reduce vector-borne disease hazards. but also destroy the wetland ecosystem and its inherent services. research can help decision making by identifying and assessing trade-offs. the new international journal EcoHealth focuses on the integration of knowledge at the intersection of ecological and health sciences. the journal provides a gathering place for research and reviews that integrate the diverse knowledge of ecology, health, and sustainability. the journal will encourage development and innovation in methods and practice that link ecology and health. the Consortium for Conservation Medicine (CCM) was formed recently to address these health challenges at the interface of ecology, wildlife health, and public health. at its core, conservation medicine champions the integration of techniques and partnerships of scientists from diverse disciplines, particularly veterinary medicine, conservation biology, and public health. investigators must consider how they can integrate their findings into the social, economic, and political dialogue on both the environment and health, globally and locally. if the work is to influence policy, the choice of questions and the research must be undertaken collaboratively with the local community."}
