{"summary": "endemic virus is one of the general viruses in human life that can be easily infected from human to human. avian influenza (H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2 etc.), swine influenza (H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N1, and H2N3 etc.) if birds are the host of an endemic virus, the situation becomes serious and uncontrollable. if birds are the host of an endemic virus, the situation becomes serious and uncontrollable. the virus is classified with the negative-sense single-strand ribonucleic acid virus. nanobiotechnology has exhibited new possibilities for detecting AIV based on the unique properties of nanobio hybrid materials. nanobiotechnology has exhibited new possibilities for detecting AIV based on the unique properties of nanobio hybrid materials. there is no study focusing on AIV detection using nanobio hybrid materials. EC-based biosensor can be divided into three groups based on bio probe type. the nanobio hybrid materials were introduced to the EC biosensor for AIV detection. the nanobio hybrid materials such as gold nanoparticles are combined with antibody or aptamer. GO-PAb-BSA nanobio hybrid material can be applied to develop the EC immunosensor for AIV detection. monoclonal H5 antibody as the bio probe was immobilized onto Au electrode in order to capture the H5 antigen. ferricyanide was used as the redox reporter. two working electrodes were composed of graphene oxide-methylene blue/circumsporozoite (GO-MB/CS)/protein-A/antibody electrodes for detecting H5N1 and H1N1 respectively. the fabricated immunosensor shows the linearity corresponding to the H5N1 concentrations. this biosensor can detect the 9.4 pM of H1N1 antigen. DPVs of graphene oxide-methylene blue/circumsporozoite (GO-MB/CS)/protein-A/anti-H1N1 electrodes against various concentrations of antigen H1N1. peak current value of modified electrode measured in PBS with desired concentration of the antigen (n = 3) a 20-nm-thick nanogap underneath the bridge-like suspended gate was formed on top of the channel between the source and drain. to capture a specific antibody against AI, they developed a silica-binding protein fused with AI antigen. the antigen\u2013antibody binding inside the nanogap increases the dielectric constant of the nanogap. probes resulted in a current change of the silicon nanowire FET biosensor. the drain current of the silicon nanowire FET changed upon injection of an anti-AI solution onto the device functionalized with the antigen of AI. a sensor signal generated by the intrinsic charges of the anti-AI can be amplified by double gates. the smaller sizes of glycans (2 nm) compared to those of antibodies (4\u201312 nm) allows for sensitive detection based on FET sensors because of the densely immobilized receptors and the proximity of target biomolecules to the sensor. rGO FET biosensor working in a flowing environment with an extended long-capture probe showed an LOD of 5 pM with a detection time of 1 h. cloacal swabs acquired from a live chicken reported diagnosis of AIV infection by a FET biosensor. nucleoproteins released from the virus were selectively bound to the AIV antibodies conjugated on the DWG surface. the intrinsic charges of nucleoproteins result in changes in the threshold voltage of the FET transducer by a field effect. the detection signal and sensitivity are degraded in high ionic concentrations by the Debye screening effect. further studies are required for AIV detection to overcome the debye screening effect. surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based Detection of AIV using nanobiohybrid materials. nanobiohybrid nanosensors can be easily tuned for sensitivity, selectivity, and detection time with nanomaterials on the substrate. materials were introduced to use the localized-SPR effect for ultrasensitive AIV detection or to construct a functional bio probe. the bio probe such as antibody or aptamer immobilized onto the well oriented nanostructure provides a high sensitivity detection platform. the IM-SPR immunosensor was compared to those of antitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), target-capture ELISA (detection time: 2.5 h, detection limit: 2.3 104 copies/mL), and rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT, detection time: 15 mins, detection limit: 402 copies/mL) the IM-SPR-based biosensor showed better sensitivity and faster detection time. superimposed absorbance spectrum of 60 multi-spot AuNP array chip. absorbance peak was obtained around 540 nm (Black line) nanobio hybrid materials can effectively reduce detection time and sensitivity. inset represents the 60 multi-spot gold-capped nanoparticle array chip with one spot of 2 mm in diameter. inset represents the 60 multi-spot gold-capped nanoparticle array chip with one spot of 2 mm in diameter. the molybdenum disulfide-QD (MoS2-QD) antibody conjugated with CdTe/CdS QD provided a detection limit of 3 ng/L for H5N1 virus detection. recently, Ahmed et al. synthesized the molybdenum disulfide-QD (MoS2-QD) with magnetic nanoparticle. Figure 5B shows the change in PL intensity corresponding to antigen concentration from 10 pg/mL to 10 g/mL. the selectivity test was carried out with different types of influenza. a few studies have reported the fabrication of AIV gene detection based on FL methods. the proposed smartphone-based FL biosensor and fluorescein isothiocyanate assay detected various types of AIV (H5N3, H7N1 and H9N2) in patient samples. for H7N1, the LOD of the smartphone-based FL detector and FICT assays showed detection limits of 5.23 101 PFU/mL and 1.09 102 PFU/mL. a novel peptide can be used as the fluorescence signal reporter in the proposed detection system. this novel peptide can be used as the fluorescence signal reporter in the proposed detection system. this novel peptide can be used as the fluorescence signal reporter in the proposed detection system. ntibody CdTe/CdS PL 3 ng/ L Virus (H5N1) [77] Antibody MoS2 QDs PL 7.35 pg/mL Virus (H5N1) [78] DNA Probe DNA Triplex with berberine FL 0.14 nM Gene [81] Antibody Coumarin-derived Dendrimer FL/FICT H5N3: 6.25 103 PFU/mL (FL), 1.25 104 nanobio hybrid material can provide high sensitivity and stable operation at the same time in the four methods described in this review. nanobio hybrid material can provide high sensitivity and stable operation at the same time in the four methods (EC, E, SPR, and FL) hybrid material-based biosensors have superior mechanical flexibility promising in wearable applications worn on the skin. new sample collection methods will be considered to obtain analyte in wearable biosensors for continuous monitoring."}
