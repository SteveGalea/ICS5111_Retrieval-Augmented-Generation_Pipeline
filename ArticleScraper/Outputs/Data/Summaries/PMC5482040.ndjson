{"summary": "toxoplasmosis caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous worldwide parasitic zoonotic disease. it is usually asymptomatic in immune-competent individuals but may occasionally lead to severe ocular and neurological disorders. there is no licensed vaccine against T. gondii clinically making the situation even worse. artemisia anomala has been widely and in long-term used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in china. recent findings suggest that it manifests its anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) the parasites were washed three times by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min as previously described. herbal drugs were boiled for 3 h in water (1 L) followed by concentrating through a rotary evaporator into 2 g/ml of the whole drugs. mice in each group were euthanized at 3 and 7 days post infection (dpi), when whole blood was collected for a blood routine test. liver, spleen, and lung tissues were collected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 7 dpi were applied to an IDEXX ProCyte Dx\u00ae hematology analyzer. the data were analyzed using the software SPSS 16.0 for Windows. herbal drugs were boiled for 3 h in water (1 L) followed by concentrating through a rotary evaporator into 2 g/ml of the whole drugs. a total of 140 female mice were randomly divided into seven groups (A to G) mice were infected with 1103 tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain. the forward and reverse primer sequences used in this study were 5'-CTGATGTCG TTCTTGCGATGTGGC-3' and 5'-GTGAAGTGGT TCTCCGTGTGT-3', respectively. a plasmid pMD-SAG1 was tenfold serially diluted ranging from 2104 to 2109 copies per milliliter tested in each independent experiment for T. gondii quantification. survival rate of mice treated with sulfadiazine and different dosages of Chinese herbs after challenge with 1103 tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain was significantly longer than that of PBS control group. survival rate was monitored daily until all infected-mice died (n=10 mice per group) every blood and tissue DNA sample was tested in triplicate. no amplification products were observed in wells from the blank control group. results of spleen, lung, and liver tissues presented a similar pattern. no significant increases were observed in eosinophil among the different T. gongdii-infected groups. lymphocytes of the infected groups were dramatically decreased compared to that of the blank group at 7 dpi (Fig. 3b; P0.05) sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice showed few changes compared to normal mice. livers of 300, 400, and 600 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice showed a clear cellular separation. the lungs of all T. gondii-infected mice represented interstitial pneumonia at different degrees with much thicker alveolar walls compared to that of the blank control group. mortality was recorded daily after the challenge with 1103 tachyzoites of T. gondii. survival time of mice in the sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herb group was significantly longer than that in the PBS control group. mice of the PBS control group had statistically significantly higher parasite load compared with sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herb groups. however, the parasite loads of mice in 300, 400, and 600 mg Chinese herb groups were all fewer than those in the PBS control group but not at a statistically significant level. lymphocytes of the infected groups were dramatically decreased compared to the blank group at 7 dpi (Fig. 3b; P0.05) neutrophil in the infected groups was increased more than double compared to the blank control group at 7 dpi (P0.05) the sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herb groups also increased significantly higher among these groups. the livers of 300, 400, and 600 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice showed slightly more cellular separation. the lungs of all T. gondii-infected mice represented interstitial pneumonia at different degrees compared to that of the blank control group. the spleen of the PBS group was extensively necrotic with few lymphoid cells and plenty of scattered cells. five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects were screened and combined into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. we applied an SAG1-based real-time PCR method to determine the parasite loads in blood and tissues from all infected groups. the level of the parasite load of the liver of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice was lower than that of the PBS control group (P0.05) spleens of all infected mice showed necrosis and degeneration. spleens of all infected mice showed necrosis and degeneration. average survival time of 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice is 11.5 d. the results gathered here suggested that these combined Chinese herbs could afford efficient protection against acute T. gondii infection. Machado et al. (2014) demonstrated that the increased monocytes and lymphocytes could be treated as a relevant hematological biomarker of acute retinochoroidal lesions caused by T. gondii. eosinophils are strong candidates for transport of T. gondii in blood. the trend of lymphocytes was opposite to that of Machado et al. (2014). mice treated with Chinese herbal medicines had been shown to elicit partial protection against acute T. gondii infection."}
