{"summary": "mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus was established. chlamydiae are implicated in a wide variety of diseases in animals and humans. chronic chlamydial infections are also associated with a variety of diseases in humans and animals. chlamydiae persist within infected tissue for extended periods of time. chlamydiae appear to be highly prevalent but only occasionally cause enteritis. they have been found in the intestine of diarrheic and healthy pigs. mixed infections with Eimeria scabra, cryptosporidia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have been described in the past. ca-PEDV co-infection alters the chlamydial developmental cycle of Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia abortus in a similar manner to other inducers of persistent infections. syncytia at 24 h post infection were mostly large with fewer medium sized syncytia observed. no difference of viral syncytia numbers for ca-PEDV monoinfection and dual infection with Chlamydia abortus were seen. in contrast, numbers of viral synyctia in dual infections with Chlamydia pecorum were diminished compared to the respective ca-PEDV single infections. b Vero cells were mock infected (Mock), C. pecorum infected, ca-PEDV infected (ca-PEDV) and Chlamydia pecorum/ca-PEDV co-infected as described. if microscopy of chlamydial single infections revealed sharply outlined inclusions with brilliant, green fluorescence. the difference between mono and double infected monolayers was statistically analyzed using students t-test. the groups were significantly different with p = 0.0132. the size and shape of chlamydial inclusions was highly variable. changes of chlamydial inclusion size by subsequent virus addition to Chlamydia abortus are different to those we observed in the Chlamydia pecorum dual infection experiments. the frequency of inclusions observed between a size range of 0-200 m2 was significantly reduced under virus infection but the amount of medium sized and big inclusions 300 - 700 m2 was increased. the viral particles showed the typical Coronavirus morphology with a diameter between 50 to 130 nm. at 39 h after chlamydial infection, large intracytoplasmic chlamydial inclusions in single infected cells could be observed in Vero cells infected with Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum. the inclusions observed contained variable numbers of morphologically normal RBs and EBs and were generally located near the aberrant inclusions consisted of reticulate-like, pleomorphic, aberrant bodies (ABs), which were larger in diameter (up to 2 m) than typical reticulate bodies (RBs), with a sparse densitometric appearance and no re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) chlamydial persistent forms are non-infectious [2] syncytia and ca-PEDV-infected cells from single and co-infected monolayers were counted. the difference between virus-infected cells and co-infection with Chlamydia abortus was minimal. the difference between virus-infected cells and co-infection with Chlamydia abortus was minimal. syncytia in co-infection with Chlamydia pecorum were reduced compared to single ca-PEDV infection. overall numbers of single viral infected cells were low in both single and co-infection experiments. no significant difference between the two chlamydial species was obvious. numbers of viral synyctia in dual infections with Chlamydia pecorum were diminished compared to the respective ca-PEDV single infections. a) vero cells were infected with Chlamydia pecorum 1 MOI for 39 h. b) double infected monolayer were labelled for ca-PEDV in red, Chlamydia in green and DNA in blue. if microscopy of chlamydial single infections revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions with brilliant, green fluorescence. chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum infected cells had one to five inclusions per cell at 39 h post infection. infectivity was almost 100% and a moderate number of free EBs could be observed. morphology and size of chlamydial inclusions in PEDV co-infections were highly variable. inclusion size in single chlamydiae-infected vero cells grew even larger than in non-viral infected vero. the changes of chlamydial inclusion size by subsequent virus addition to Chlamydia abortus are different to those we observed in the Chlamydia pecorum dual infection experiments. the frequency of inclusions observed between a size range of 0-200 m2 was significantly reduced under virus infection but the amount of medium sized and big inclusions 300 - 700 m2 was increased. the morphology of Chlamydia abortus inclusions was also found chlamydial inclusions in single infected cells could be observed in vero cells infected with Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum. inclusions contained variable numbers of normal RBs and EBs. three types of inclusions were present in dual infections with ca-PEDV and Chlamydia abortus. dual infections with ca-PEDV and Chlamydia pecorum resulted in exclusive production of aberrant inclusions consisting of 2-50 ABs. chlamydial persistent forms are non-infectious [2] t-test revealed no statistical difference (p = 0.2523) presumably due to the high variation in the data. chlamydial co-infection does alter ca-PEDV infection depending on the chlamydial species but does not alter viral ultrastructure. in both single and co-infection experiments, no significant difference between the two chlamydial species was obvious. in ca-PEDV single and co-infected cells, viral particles were unaltered indicating that chlamydial co-infection did not induce any changes in viral ultrastructural morphology. a previous study primarily investigated the interaction of ca-PEDV and Chlamydiaceae in mixed infections to detect possible synergistic or additive effects of these two path mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma hominis did not change the morphology of chlamydial RBs. in the study by Deka et al. (2006), HeLa monolayers were first infected with Chlamydia trachomatis and 24 h later with HSV-2. to this end, vero monolayers were first infected with Chlamydia and later with ca-PEDV, thus the suspected induce chlamydial persistence was more prominent in co-infection with Chlamydia pecorum than with Chlamydia abortus. limited reports are available for in vitro models of chlamydial persistence from non-Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae strains. the mechanism by which ca-PEDV interferes with chlamydial persistence is still unclear. it is known that Vero cells, a monkey kidney epithelial cell line, is deficient for interferon production. this cytokine group well known to be capable of inducing in vitro persistence in Chlamydia pneumoniae [1] cannot be relevant for co-infection persistence model. the in vitro model described by Deka et al. (2006) represents a realistic situation in human medicine. similarities exist to the in vitro model established in this study as simultaneous intestinal infection with different pathogens is possible in swine in vivo. media and cells Growth medium (GM) for normal cell propagation was Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle's salts, 25 mM HEPES, without L-Glutamine (GIBCO), 4 mM GlutaMAX-I (200 mM, GIBCO) and 0.2 mg/ml gentamycin (50 mg/ml, GIBCO) chlamydial strains were cultured in embryonated chicken eggs. yolk sac material was harvested, diluted 1:2 in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate (SPG) medium and stored at -80\u00b0C. EBs were then propagated in HEp-2 cell monolayers. the optimal experimental protocol (adding the virus several hours after chlamydial infection) for co-infection procedure was developed before. for dual infections, cell monolayers were first infected with Chlamydia at a MOI of 1 for Chlamydia and an infective dose of 1 105,5 TCID50/ml for ca-PEDV. diluted 1:4 in PBS supplemented with BSA, and an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody were used. DNA was labeled with 1 g/ml 4', 6-Diamidin-2'-phenylindoldihydrochlorid (DAPI, Molecular Probes), respectively. ultrathin sections (80 nm) were mounted on gold grids. contrasted with uranyl acetate dihydrate (Fluka) and lead citrate (lead nitrate and tri-natrium dihydrate; Merck Eurolab AG) and investigated in a Philips CM10 electron microscope. cells and inclusions were automatically detected according to size, shape and intensity. GM without gentamycin was used for the propagation of cells for infection experiments. chlamydiaceae strains were cultured in embryonated chicken eggs. yolk sac material was harvested, diluted 1:2 in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate (SPG) medium and stored at -80\u00b0C. chlamydiaceae were then propagated in HEp-2 cell monolayers. vero cells were divided into four groups: for mock infection, chlamydial infection, ca-PEDV infection, and both Chlamydia and ca-PEDV double infection. all co-infection experiments were done three times and monoinfections with Chlamydia and ca-PEDV were performed simultaneously. the optimal experimental protocol (adding the virus several hours after chlamydial infection) was developed before. a mouse monoclonal antibody against the M protein of PEDV (mcAb 204), diluted 1:4 in PBS supplemented with BSA, and an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody. DNA was labeled with 1 g/ml 4', 6-Diamidin-2'-phenylindoldihydrochlorid (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) ultrastructure investigation was performed using semithin sections (1 m) stained with toluidine blue (Fluka, Buchs SG, Switzerland) ultrathin sections (80 nm) were mounted on gold grids (Merck Eurolab AG, Dietlikon, Switzerland), contrasted with uranyl acetate dihydrate (Fluka) and lead citrate (lead nitrate and tri-natrium dihydrate; Merck Eurolab AG) the number of inclusion-forming units (IFU) in the inoculum was then calculated and expressed as IFU per 106 cells. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
