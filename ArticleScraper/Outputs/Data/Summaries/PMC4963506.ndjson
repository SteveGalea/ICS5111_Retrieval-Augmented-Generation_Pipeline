{"summary": "the number of newly emerging infectious diseases which affect swine has increased rapidly in the past 2 decades. several economically important diseases, such as the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus strain 2 (PCV2), and porcine coronaviruses, have emerged to cause severe production losses. the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is characterized by acute diarrhea and vomiting in neonatal piglets, with mortality rates of about 90% (3). the diagnosis of early cases was complicated by the fact that the diarrhea observed in clinical cases of PEDV is similar to the clinical signs of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus. a total of 169 field serum samples from PEDV-suspect and -nonsuspect cases were used for assay development. the selection of samples was random, and identify of the samples was blinded. vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. they were grown to confluence over 3 to 4 days. cells were washed three times with serum-free medium. positive and negative controls were included in each plate. the cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope for characteristic cytoplasmic fluorescence. a stretch of 283 amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli. transformed cultures were induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. the soluble protein fraction was extracted with BugBuster protein extraction reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and purified by affinity purification (His-spin protein miniprep purification kit; Zymo Research, Orange, CA), according to the the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) was used to generate cDNA. the sequences of the primers were 5\u2032-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGC CACCATGCGTGCAAATTCACGTAGCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT the blot was developed by standard procedures, with PEDV positive-control swine serum (NVSL, Ames, IA) (1:500), experimentally generated swine anti-TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV sera (1:500) as the primary antibody. the bands were visualized by staining with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (ThermoFisher, Grand Island, NY), except the band shown in Figure 3A. computationally designed PEDV NP target probed with swine anti-PDCoV serum and the protein ladder. optimal concentration of the in vitro translated nucleoprotein for use as the capture antigen was determined by a checkerboard titration. all samples were assessed in duplicate in two independent assays. positive-control serum samples purchased from NVSL (Ames, IA) and serum samples from pigs infected with TGEV, PRCV, PDCoV, PCV2, PRRSV, and SIV were used as controls to assess cross-reactivity on both ELISAs. positive-control serum samples for TGEV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and the porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) collected from experimentally infected pigs (7\u20139) were provided by Linda Saif (Ohio State University) vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. they were grown to confluence over 3 to 4 days. cells were washed three times with serum-free medium containing 2.5 g/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin. the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) was used to generate cDNA. the amplified DNA was directionally cloned into the pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) plasmid. RNA from the PEDV culture was extracted by an RNeasy minikit. iScript cDNA synthesis kit was used to generate cDNA. sequences of conserved amino acid sequence were then analyzed for predicted antigenicity. a western blot was used to rapidly generate antigen for the ELISA. the identity of the expressed products was verified by a Western blot. the NPs obtained by bacterial expression and in vitro transcription were loaded on 12% or 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. the bacterially expressed PEDV NP probed with swine anti-PEDV serum. the computationally designed PEDV NP target probed with swine anti-PDCoV serum. the optimal concentration of the in vitro translated nucleoprotein was determined by a checkerboard titration. anti-swine HRP-conjugated IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added at a 1:5,000 dilution to the plate. 50 l of test sera at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer was added into each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was stopped with 1 M HCl, and the plates were read at 450 nm. agreement between the dichotomized ELISA and IFA values was assessed using the kappa coefficient association method. all statistical analysis was carried out using the kappa coefficient association method. RESULTS Immunofluorescence assay. a unique fragment of 45 amino acids length at positions 153 to 198 was present in the PEDV NP. the fragment was highly conserved in a majority of PEDV strains. the only changes detected were, in positions 191 to 193, GGN to GNN in 7 sequences. the entire stretch of the unique amino acid sequence identified in the nucleoprotein was predicted to be highly immunogenic, with an average index value of 1.7. the sequence was composed of turn regions, interspersed with a few coils. the ABCpred prediction server predicted two epitopes with high scores. ROC analysis of the conventional ELISA with the IFA as the gold standard generated sensitivity and specificity values of 91.94% and 93.00%, respectively, at a cutoff value of 0.47. positive and negative predictive values were 90.5% and 94.1%, respectively. sensitivity and specificity were 89.39% and 88.89% respectively. positive and negative predictive values were 85.3% and 91.8% respectively. agreement between diagnostic assays ranged from 0.8 to 0.9. the mean values of the signal-positive ratios of individual samples for the conventional assay are depicted on the x axis. the values for the computationally designed assay are plotted on the y axis. the interassay variation was minimal. uninfected cells did not show any florescence. amino acid sequence analysis for the identification of unique regions in the PEDV N and S proteins. sequences of the S protein from PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV were aligned with the Clustal W program. the unique region is indicated in bold letters. the computationally predicted B-cell epitopes are underlined. the entire identified unique region of the NP was used for further analysis. kDa was recognized by an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody at the expected molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa. darker bands between 20 and 30 kDa were also detected. no cross-reactivity was detected to TGEV, PRCV, or PDCoV. ROC analysis of the conventional NP ELISA with the IFA as the gold standard, with an AUC value of 0.948 (A); of the computationally designed NP ELISA with the conventional ELISA as the gold standard, with an AUC value of 0.961 (B); and of the computationally designed NP ELISA with the conventional ELISA as the gold standard, with an AUC value of 0.931 (C) agreement between the three tests was very good. the relationship was linear, with a majority of samples clustering around the trend line. the agreement between the three tests was very good. the number of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases affecting swine has increased significantly during the past 20 years (1). the introduction of foreign diseases is a consistently looming threat for the nation's food supply. high scores of 0.92 and 0.70 were assigned to the two predicted epitopes. the bepipred server assigned high probability scores to all of the residues. a longer stretch of peptide sequence could help capture antibodies targeting some conformational epitopes as well as linear epitopes. cross-reactivity between human coronaviruses and feline coronaviruses reported to confound diagnosis and accuracy of seroprevalence studies. cross-reactivity has not been reported in studies where partial or complete proteins have been used for serological assay development for PEDV (5, 6) cross-reactivity between PEDV and PDCoV N proteins was recently reported and attributed to conserved regions in the N protein. all studies reported sensitivity and specificity values in the range of 90% to 95%. the computationally designed assay developed in this study was comparable in performance to other published assays, as well as to the IFA (Table 1)."}
