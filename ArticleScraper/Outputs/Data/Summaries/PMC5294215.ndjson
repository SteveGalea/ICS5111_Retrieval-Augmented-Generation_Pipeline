Overall, [IgG] and [IgM] were higher in sera from patients compared with those from the healthy group. no significant differences were observed in [IgG] against II-E and IV-E. serological testing against specific proteins could differentiate dengue serotypes. a violin plot generated for both I-E and III-E revealed significant differences for the tail of the violin. time-dependent [IgG] responses against I-E and III-E were clearly observed in all three patients. a rapid increase after infection up to day 8 to 14 followed by a decrease, consistent with the general viral immune response (29). a set of 3,604 complete polyprotein sequences of the dengue virus were identified. these sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis. the well-established serotypes of the dengue virus were recapitulated. dengue virus proteins of all the four serotypes were successfully purified using a high-throughput way. the synthesized genes were integrated into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1. the proteins were expressed and purified in a high-throughput format. protein microarray, usually, 85% purity for most of the proteins could be obtained. most of the \u201cnonspecific\u201d bands were smaller than the proteins of expected size. most of the \u201cnonspecific\u201d bands were smaller than the proteins of expected size. the quality of the microarray was first evaluated using rabbit anti-GST antibodies and G-A-R-Cy5 secondary antibodies. all 44 purified dengue proteins were successfully immobilized on the microarray. the information of the dengue virus proteome microarray was deposited on the protein microarray database. the sera of patients infected with dengue virus (PI, PII, and PIII) were probed on the proteome microarray. sera from healthy people were also included as a control. status of all sera was confirmed by a variety of assays. patients diagnosed as viral hemorrhagic fever or infected by Scrub typus and pidemic encephalitis B, respectively, showed significant differences of [IgG] and [IgM] against proteins of all serotypes. the overall [IgG] signal was significantly higher than [IgM], which may be due to the later immune response of IgG than IgM. phylogenetic analysis indicates I-E and III-E were more closely clustered among the four serotypes. a violin plot generated for both I-E and III-E revealed significant differences for the tail of the violin. protein E could be further developed as a biomarker for a subset of strains. the immune-response to I-E and III-E were similar for each patient. a set of 3,604 complete polyprotein sequences of the dengue virus were identified. the 3,604 polyprotein sequences could be separated into four groups. serotypes I, II, III, and IV contained 1,525, 1,104, 823 and 152 sequences. the consensus sequence for each serotype was then determined. the clones were inoculated to a 12-channel plate for culture and protein expression. the cells were harvested, and the proteins were affinity purified in a 96-deep well plate. the purified proteins were stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to microarray printing. the abundance and purity of most of the 44 proteins were suitable for protein microarray fabrication. each of the purified proteins was spotted in triplicate using a microarrayer. serially diluted IgG and IgM from human sera were also included. the information of the dengue virus proteome microarray was deposited on the Protein Microarray Database (www.proteinmicroarray.cn) with number PMDA 173. there were no nonspecific bindings of d-A-H-IgM-649 or d-A-H-IgG-549, except, with the latter, to protein C and NS5 of some serotypes. sera from healthy people were also included as a control. status of all sera was confirmed by a variety of assays. virus isolation, real-time PCR, or ELISA-based serological detection. IgG and IgM were found to bind to some dengue proteins of all serotypes. the overall [IgG] signal was significantly higher than [IgM], which may be owing to the later immune response of IgG than IgM and the faster dynamics of IgM than IgM upon viral infection. ELISA was performed by using an independent set of samples against protein I-E and III-E. Detection of Dynamic IgG Responses for I-E and III-E after dengue Virus Infection. we have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method using dengue virus as an example. we have then demonstrated its usefulness with serum profiling. we have found that protein I-E and III-E show potential as biomarkers of dengue virus infection. current technologies for artificial gene synthesis are still not well suited for synthesis of long genes, for example, longer than 5 kb. however, current technologies for artificial gene synthesis are still not well suited for synthesis of long genes, for example, longer than 5 kb. proteins I-E and III-E can be used as biomarkers for a subset of patients. the candidate protein I-E and III-E are validated by a new set of sera. the findings are consistent with previous studies (27, 28) PAGES could also be applied to construct a \u201cpan-virus\u201d protein microarray. this could cover many of the important viruses, from SARS to Zika."}
