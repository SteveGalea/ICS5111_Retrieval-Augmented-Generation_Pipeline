{"summary": "a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin protein from the H5N1 influenza virus as model antigens. the antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid. a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended. a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective. for insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is more effective. a high copy ice-nucleation protein (Inp) derived surface-expressed system was employed to produce a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against hepatitis B virus. a low copy OmpA-derived surface display system was used to develop a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against hepatitis B virus. the vaccine strain containing the chromosome-based expression system induced a stronger humoral immune response than the one containing the plasmid-based expression system. animal experiments subsequently revealed that the membrane-expressed HIV antigen was capable of inducing a better humoral response than the cytoplasmically-expressed HIV antigen expressed using the other two expression systems. recombinant salmonella-EGFP strains were first constructed to express the EGFP gene by a single strategy in a single chromosomal or episomal context. Strains HP, LP and CP were each designed to express EGFP in the cytoplasm of SL7207 from a high copy plasmid, or low copy plasmid or chromosome-based prosseA expression cassette. eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP also uses pUC origin as backbone. the high-copy eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP also uses pUC origin. pACYC177 derivative containing prosseA promoter, egfp gene This study pHO AmpR; pMD18-T derivative containing lac promoter, and lpp-ompA-egfp gene This study pCO-cm AmpR, CmR. pBSK derivative containing prosseA promoter, lpp-ompA-egfp gene, and loxp-cm-loxp five additional \u2018double-recombinant\u2019 Salmonella-EGFP strains were then constructed, by combining two of the above strategies. four of them were created from the chromosome-based EGFP expression strain, CP. the pEGFP plasmid was transformed into the LP strain to generate a further double-recombinant strain, E + LP. green fluorescence could be directly observed in cells of the HP, LP, CP and HO strains. EGFP expression was confirmed by Western blotting. the SL7207 parent strain was used as a control. expression of EGFP protein (theoretical mass ca. 26 kDa) was detected at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection using a GFP mouse monoclonal IgG. the average lengths of the HP, HO and E strains were 8.1 m, 6.0 m and 5.5 m respectively, which was considerably longer than the average length of the SL7207 cells. each bar represents the mean length of 20 bacterial cells randomly selected from multiple microscopic fields for each strain, as measured using Image J software. CP + LP strain, cells were highly elongated compared with the SL7207 strain. CP + HP, CP + HO and CP + E cells were also significantly filamented, with average lengths of 6.2 m, 3.2 m and 7.3 m respectively. the intensities of EGFP fluorescence in the five \u2018double-recombinant\u2019 strains were not enhanced, as had initially been expected. the fluorescence intensity of the CP + HP strain (5.6 102 a.u.) was more than three-fold lower than the parent HP strain (1.9 103 a.u., p 0.01). in vitro growth rates of recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were measured in liquid LB medium supplemented with antibiotics in vitro. the doubling times of the six single and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were significantly higher than that of the parental strain SL7207 (26.3 0.9 min, p 0.05). the growth rates of the LP and HO strains were considerably different to those of the corresponding empty-vector strains ACYC177 (42.8 1.7 min, p 0.01) and OmpA (35.8 1.2 min, p 0.05). this suggests both EGFP expression and plasmid burden affected their growth rates. the growth rate of strain VAX-1 + ACYC177, which contains two empty vectors, was measured as a control for the E + LP strain. experiments revealed that there were no significant differences in the growth rates of these two strains. three plasmids (pLP, pHO, pEGFP) and two chromosome-based expression cassettes (CP and CO strains) exhibited good stability, with 100.0% survival rate on the selection plates. for the HP strain, only 88.9% of CFUs maintained pHP. mosome-based EGFP expression cassettes and low-copy plasmids (pUC-replicons, in the LP strains) appeared to be very stable, with a 100.0% detection rate. however, the high copy plasmids in the double-recombinant strains were significantly less stable. fecal samples, spleen and mesenteric lymph node samples were collected from each group of mice on days 1, 3 and 7. the SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control. the CP strain was present in the highest levels in the feces. only 2.9% and 7.5% of CFUs corresponding to the HP and E strains contained high copy plasmids. the pHO plasmid in the HO strain declined to very low levels that could not be accurately calculated. the CP chromosome-based expression strain showed the highest survival abilities in feces on day 1 and 3 after inoculation. samples randomly collected from six mice in each group. error bars show the standard deviation. the SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control. the SL7207 group, Salmonella, was found in 66.7% of mice spleens (4 out of 6 mice) with an average of 4 105 cfu/g. the detection rate for the low copy plasmid was 100.0%. the spleen infection rate in the SL7207 administration group was still 100.0%. for the HP and HO groups, 83.3% of mice spleens tested positive for Salmonella infection, with an average of 7 105 cfu/g. however, no high copy plasmids could be detected in either of these two strains. only 16.7% mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the SL7207 and CO groups had Salmonella infection in their lymph nodes. detection rate for chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain was 100.0%. the detection rate for the high copy plasmid pHP was only 5.0%. for the CO group, 16.7% mice (1 out of 6 mice) tested positive for Salmonella infection in the lymph nodes. the stability of the chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain was 85.7%. however, the detection rate for the high copy plasmid pEGFP was only 25.0%. the cytoplasmic expression group (HP, LP and CP), 50.0% of mice (3 of the 6 mice) in the HP subgroup had elevated anti-EGFP IgG responses. the average titers were around 1:21,000 on days 28 and 42. the highest titer reached 1:200,000. the eleven recombinant Salmonella -EGFP strains were administrated to one of eleven groups of mice (5\u201310 mice for each group), with an additional group of non-infected mice kept as a negative control. ELISA assays were performed using mice sera collected on day 7, 28 and 42. only 14.3% of mice (1 of 7 mice) in the CP + HP group and 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the E + LP group had anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:700 on day 28, and 1:2,500 on day 42. no response could be detected in the CP + E group even after two boosts. the humoral response rates against the five double-recombinant salmonella-EGFP strains did not increase as was initially expected. the anti-EGFP IFN- responses raised by the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were also evaluated. the average ratio of anti-EGFP IFN- responses in mice was 5.33, 1.61, 9.90 and 2.87. responses against several strains, such as CP + LP, CP + E and E + LP, were significantly lower than the respective single-recombinant parental strains CP and E. the HAOP fragment was subcloned into sets of plasmids analogous to those used for the EGFP gene. for outer membrane expression, HAOP was subcloned into the pHO plasmid to generate pO-HAOP. the expression of HAOP was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. results from ELISA experiments showing HA-specific IgG response raised by the O-HAOP strain using the HO strain as a negative control. 10 mice were used for each group; 1 1011 bacteria were used to prime each mouse for 3 days. sera taken from 50.0% O-HAOP-infected mice (5 out of 10 mice) contained neutralization antibodies. HIA titers within the O-HAOP-infected mice were significantly different to those obtained for the non-infected group. six'single-recombinant' SL7207-EGFP strains were first constructed to express the EGFP gene by a single strategy in a single chromosomal or episomal context. Strains HP, LP and CP were each designed to express EGFP in the cytoplasm of salmonella from a high copy plasmid, or a low copy plasmid or chromosome-based prosseA expression cassette.

EGFP expression was detected by infecting the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line with E strain. the SL7207 parent strain was used as a control. CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E and E + LP (B) expression of EGFP protein (theoretical mass ca. 39 kDa) was detected at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection using a GFP mouse monoclonal IgG. length of the SL7207 cells was 2.5 m [19]. each bar represents the mean length of 20 bacterial cells randomly selected from multiple microscopic fields for each strain. bars in the graph represent the average fluorescence intensities from three independent experiments, standard deviation. EGFP expression levels in recombinant salmonella-EGFP strains were determined using a micro-plate reader. the intensity of green fluorescence for 1 108 freshly cultured planktonic cells was determined using a micro-plate reader. for the three \u2018cytoplasmic expression\u2019 single-recombinant strains there were clear differences in fluorescence levels. the fluorescence intensity of the CP + HP strain (5.6 102 a.u.) was more than three-fold lower than the parent HP strain (1.9 103 a.u., p 0.01) the fluorescence of the CP + HO strain (11 a.u.) was essentially identical to the CP parent (11 a.u.), and more than 6-fold lower than the HO strain (68 a.u., p 0.01). doubling times of the six single and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were measured in liquid LB medium supplemented with antibiotics in vitro. the growth rate of the chromosome-based outer-membrane strain CO was considerably slower than that of the other five strains. the growth rate of strains CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E, E + LP was significantly higher than the doubling time of the SL7207 strain (p 0.01). growth rates of strains CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E, E + LP were significantly slower than those of the corresponding single-recombinant parental strains. CYC177 contains two empty vectors: pVAX-1 and pEGFP. the results indicated that double-recombinant strategies seriously reduced the growth rates of these five strains compared to that of strains with single strategies and SL7207. three plasmids (pLP, pHO, pEGFP) and two chromosome-based expression cassettes (CP and CO strains) showed good stability, with 100.0% survival rate. however, for the HP strain, only 88.9% of CFUs maintained pHP. this indicated that EGFP expression in the HP strain may be less stable than the other strains. CP + HP strain, pHO in the CP + HO strain, and pEGFP in the E + LP strain were 0.8%, 60.0% and 50.0% respectively. differences in fluorescence levels between the single and double-recombinant strains correlates-well with the plasmid stability properties revealed by the CFU assays. the SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control. 105-109 cfu/g of the Salmonella cells were present on day one. the CP strain was present in the highest levels in the feces. fecal bacterial cells from the six recombinant groups decreased to very low levels, of around 103-104 cfu/g. the SL7207 group showed the best reserve, at around 105 cfu/g. the CP chromosome-based expression strain exhibited the highest survival abilities in feces on day 1 and 3 after inoculation. rate in this group was significantly different from those of the other strains (P 0.01). (B) and (C) show the infection ability and construct stability results for the six single-recombinant Salmonella -EGFP strains in mice spleen (B) and mesenteric lymph nodes (C) each represents one mouse. spleen infection rates were 66.7% (4 out of 6 mice) and 50.0% (3 out of 6 mice) no Salmonella infection could be detected for the HP, HO and E strains. only 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) had spleens infected with salmonella cells. stability of the chromosome-based expression cassette within the strain remained at 100.0%. but no pEGFP plasmid could be isolated in the E group. in the LP group, the lymph node infection rate was 33.3% (2 out of 6 mice) with an average of 2 103 cfu/g and 2 104 cfu/g. the stability of the EGFP expression cassettes in the LP, CP and HO groups were 92.9%, 100.0% and 73.3%, respectively. the CO strain was 85.7%, with average counts of 1 103 cfu/g. however, the detection rate for the high copy plasmid pEGFP was only 25.0%. EGFP expression was confirmed by Western blotting. expression was observed in mice intestinal mucosa on day 1 after inoculation. expression of EGFP protein (theoretical mass ca. 26 kDa) was detected at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection using a GFP mouse monoclonal IgG. expression of EGFP protein was detected at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection. the average lengths of the HP, HO and E strains were 8.1 m, 6.0 m and 5.5 m respectively, which was considerably longer than the average length of the SL7207 cells. each bar represents the mean length of 20 bacterial cells randomly selected from multiple microscopic fields for each strain, as measured using Image J software. cells of each of the five strains were highly elongated compared with the SL7207 strain. CP + HP, CP + HO and CP + E cells were also significantly filamented, with average lengths of 6.2 m, 3.2 m and 7.3 m respectively. the EGFP-expression levels in the six \u2018single-recombinant\u2019 salmonella strains were in the order (highest to lowest) the intensities of EGFP fluorescence in the five \u2018double-recombinant\u2019 strains were not enhanced, as had initially been expected. FP expression levels within the double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were generally greatly reduced, when compared to their parental strains. in vitro growth rates of the six single and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were measured in liquid LB medium supplemented with antibiotics in vitro. plasmids were primarily responsible for the increase in doubling times for the HP and E strains. growth rates of the LP and HO strains were significantly different to those of the corresponding empty-vector strains ACYC177 and OmpA. 58.3 2.5, 51.0 2.3, 105.9 7.4, 65.7 2.5 and 68.3 9.9 minutes respectively. growth rates were significantly slower than those of the corresponding single-recombinant parental strains. three plasmids (pLP, pHO, pEGFP) and two chromosome-based expression cassettes (CP and CO strains) exhibited good stability, with 100.0% survival rate on the selection plates. however, for the HP strain, only 88.9% of CFUs maintained pHP. chromosome-based EGFP expression cassettes and low-copy plasmids (pUC-replicons, in the LP strains) appeared to be very stable, with a 100.0% detection rate. however, the high copy plasmids in the double-recombinant strains were significantly less stable. fecal samples, spleen and mesenteric lymph node samples were collected from each group of mice. the SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control. the CP strain was present in the highest levels in the feces. plasmid within the LP strain was somewhat less stable, declining from 100% to 68.9%. only 2.9% and 7.5% of CFUs corresponding to the HP and E strains contained high copy plasmids. the pHO plasmid in the HO strain declined to very low levels. the SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control. a (2) Construct retention rates for the six single-recombinant strains in mice feces on days 1, 3 and 7 after inoculation. salmonella was found in 66.7% of mice spleens (4 out of 6 mice) with an average of 4 105 cfu/g. 83.3% of mice (5 out of 6 mice) in the LP group were infected with Salmonella. spleen infection rate was still 100.0%, with an average of 7 105 cfu/g. 83.3% of mice spleens tested positive for Salmonella infection. stability of chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain remained at 100.0%. only 16.7% mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the SL7207 and CO groups had Salmonella infection in their lymph nodes. the detection rate for chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain was 100.0%. the SL7207 and HP groups were 33.3% (2 out of 6 mice) with an average of 8 104 cfu/g and 2 103 cfu/g respectively. the detection rate for the high copy plasmid pHP was only 5.0%. in the cytoplasmic expression group, 50.0% of mice (3 of the 6 mice) in the HP subgroup had elevated anti-EGFP IgG responses. the average titers were around 1:21,000 on days 28 and 42. 100.0% of mice (all 9 mice) in the LP subgroup had strong anti-EGFP IgG responses. the eleven recombinant Salmonella -EGFP strains were administrated to one of eleven groups of mice (5\u201310 mice for each group) for each group, 1 1011 bacteria were used to prime each mouse for 3 days, and boost on day 21 and 35, by oral gavage. one-Way ANOVA ( P 0.05) represents one mouse. each represents one mouse. only 14.3% of mice (1 of 7 mice) in the CP + HP group and 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) generated a humoral response. mice (3 out of 6 mice) generated anti-EGFP IgG responses. average titers were 1:35,000 on day 42. no response could be detected in CP + E group even after two boosts. only 12.5% of mice (1 of 8 mice) in the HO subgroup had an anti-EGFP IgG response, with a titer of 1:390 on day 28, and 1:500 on day 42. in the eukaryotic expression plasmid group, only 20.0% of mice (1 of 5 mice) responded, having a 1:10,000 anti-EGFP IgG titer on day 28, and a 1: 25,000 titer on day 42 ELISA assays were performed using mice sera collected on day 7, 28 and 42. under the LP strain in (A) indicates the mean ELISA titer raised by LP strain is significantly higher than those of other strain. 28.6% of mice (2 of 7 mice) in the CP + HP group had anti-EGFP IgG responses. in the CP + LP group, 60.0% of mice (3 out of 5 mice) had anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:700 on day 28, and 1:2,500 on day 42. inant Salmonella-EGFP strains were also determined within immunized mice. an equally sized group of uninfected mice was included as a negative control. the cytoplasmic expression group had an average ratio of 6.39, 6.51 and 14.05. the average ratio of anti-EGFP IFN- responses for the E + LP immunized mice versus the control set was 4.95. responses against several strains, such as CP + LP, CP + E and E + LP, were significantly lower than the respective single-recombinant parental strains CP and E (p 0.05). HAOP was subcloned into the pHO plasmid to generate pO-HAOP. both constructs were transformed into SL7207 to create a cytoplasmic HA expression strain of Salmonella (C-HAOP) and an outer-membrane HA expression strain of Salmonella (O-HAOP) the expression of HAOP was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. HIA using blood sera from mice infected with O-HAOP strain on day 42. blood sera from non-infected mice and mice infected with the HO strain were also used as negative controls. titer raised by the strain was significantly different from those of HO and No-infection groups (P 0.05). interferon-gamma (IFN-) responses to recombinant Salmonella-HA strains were evaluated using ELISpot assays. non-infected mice as well as HO-infected mice were used as negative controls. antibodies with titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:128 (average titer of 1:30) were significantly different to those obtained for the non-infected group. non-infected mice as well as HO-infected mice were used as negative controls. sera taken from 50.0% O-HAOP-infected mice (5 out of 10 mice) contained neutralization antibodies with titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:128 (average titer of 1:30) the HIA titers within the O-HAOP-infected mice were significantly different to those obtained for the non-infected group. six recombinant strains, including three cytoplasmic expression strains (HP, LP and CP), were constructed. two outer-membrane expression strains (HO, CO) and one eukaryotic expression plasmid (strain E) were combined to produce five additional \u2018double-recombinant\u2019 strains. the HO strain expressed higher levels of EGFP than the chromosome-based CO strain in vitro. the high copy number pHO plasmid pHO showed poor in vivo stability. the eukaryotic plasmid expression levels may not be as high as those generated by salmonella strains containing high or low copy prokaryotic plasmids. antigens of interest expressed from high copy prokaryotic plasmids were able to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses. many of these vaccine strains had either negligible or fairly low immunogenicity, due to the instability of the high copy plasmid. homologous recombination has been used to insert a heterologous antigen expression cassette into the Salmonella chromosome. the heterologous gene is present as a single copy per bacterium. expression levels may be too low to effectively induce a B cell response. the recombinant Salmonella cells would be lysed within the phagosomes. they would then express the plasmid-encoded antigen and present them to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in the Peyer\u2019s patches or mesenteric lymph nodes via MHC I and MHC II molecules. this process induces further mucosal, humoral or cellular immune responses against the heterologous antigen. oral immunization with the surface protein from the hepatitis B virus elicited good T cell responses, but its B cell responses were quite low. a chromosome-based expression system (CP strain) could also generate better T cell responses than strains containing high copy prokaryotic plasmids. ome-based CO strain showed in vivo stabilities equivalent to the CP strain. it slowed the growth rate of the CO strain, resulting in poorer in vivo survival and proliferation abilities (colonization ability) it is possible that the membrane-expressed EGFP significantly slowed the growth rate of the CO strain. the CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and E + LP strains were designed to elicit both stronger B cell and T cell responses. the CP + E strain was constructed to investigate whether it could generate a stronger T cell response that was higher than those of the two individual strains. copy plasmids were not lost from some of the recombinant Salmonella strains in vitro. this may be due to the \u2018metabolic burden\u2019 caused by the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell. this may be due to the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell, leading to decrease in its overall immunogenic properties. membrane expression cassettes were located on a high-copy plasmid (HO strain) and on the chromosome (CO strain) the B cell responses against these two strains were weaker than those obtained for the LP strain; the T cell responses against the HO strain were lower than those obtained for the LP strain. this may be because the total amounts of EGFP synthesized and exported to the outer membrane were too low to induce an effective B cell response. six recombinant strains, including three cytoplasmic expression strains (HP, LP and CP) and two outer-membrane expression strains (HO, CO) and one eukaryotic expression plasmid (strain E), were constructed. several pairs of EGFP-expression systems were combined, to produce five additional \u2018double-recombinant\u2019 strains. the HO strain, which harbors the high copy number pHO plasmid, expressed higher levels of EGFP than the chromosome-based CO strain in vitro. the EGFP expression levels in the HO strain were lower than those in HP or LP, and the high copy plasmid pHO showed poor in vivo stability (as did pHP) antigens of interest expressed from high copy prokaryotic plasmids were able to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses. many of these vaccine strains had either negligible or fairly low immunogenicity, due to the instability of the high copy plasmid. this strain induced the highest levels of B cell immunogenicity. homologous recombination has been used to insert a heterologous antigen expression cassette into the Salmonella chromosome. the heterologous gene is present as a single copy per bacterium. expression levels may be too low to effectively induce a B cell response. recombinant Salmonella cells would be lysed within the phagosomes. they would then express the plasmid-encoded antigen and present them to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in the Peyer\u2019s patches or mesenteric lymph nodes. this process induces further mucosal, humoral or cellular immune responses against the heterologous antigen. a chromosome-based expression system (CP strain) could also generate better T cell responses than strains containing high copy prokaryotic plasmids. colonization with recombinant vaccine strains with good construct stability is also an important factor for eliciting strong T cell responses. the chromosome-based CO strain showed in vivo stabilities equivalent to the CP strain, but its T cell responses were lower. it is possible that the membrane-expressed EGFP significantly slowed the growth rate of the CO strain, resulting in poorer in vivo survival and proliferation abilities (colonization ability), compared to the CP strain. the CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and E + LP strains were designed to elicit both stronger B cell and T cell responses. the CP + E strain was constructed to investigate whether it could generate a stronger T cell response that was higher than those of the two individual strains. high-copy plasmids were not lost from some of the recombinant Salmonella strains in vitro. this may be due to the \u2018metabolic burden\u2019 caused by the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell. this may be due to the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell, leading to decrease in its overall immunogenic properties. the lpp-ompA system is present in the O-HAOP strain. it is possible that the use of the lpp-ompA system helps the HA protein fold into a soluble conformation. it is possible that the use of the lpp-ompA system either helps the HA protein fold into a soluble conformation. if the antigen is soluble and easily expressed in Salmonella, a low-copy plasmid-based strategy should be employed. for heterologous antigens that are likely to be expressed in an insoluble form within Salmonella, an outer membrane-targeting approach is recommended. the combination of two expression strategies did not enhance the immune response. restriction endonucleases and ligase enzymes were purchased from new England BioLabs. Taq polymerase (Pyrobest and Ex-taq) and the pMD18-T vector were from Takara.

lpp-OmpA outer membrane expression cassette was amplified from SL7207 using primers ompA-F and ompA-R. pHO was constructed by ligating an EGFP cassette downstream of lpp-OmpA in pOmpA via NotI and XhoI. expression strains were amplified from pCP-cm and pCO-cm by PCR. red recombineering was used to construct the CP and CO strains. transient expression of -Red genes from pSim6 in SL7207. pO-HAOP was analogously generated by replacing the EGFP gene of pHO with a notI/XhoI-digested HAOP fragment. pO-HAOP was electro-transformed into SL7207 to generate a cytoplasmic-expression HAOP Salmonella strain (denoted C-HAOP) and a membrane-expression HAOP Salmonella strain (denoted O-HAOP) freshly-cultured bacterial cells (10 l) were immobilized on 1% agarose pads on glass slides, then visualized using a 60x oil-immersion objective lens. both bright-field and fluorescent field (ex. 488 nm, em. 518 nm) images were captured (Spot RT3 Digital Camera, Spot Advanced Software Version 4.6) cells from 4 ml of induced bacterial culture were collected and resuspended in 100 l PBS + 50 l of loading buffer (60 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2%SDS, 14.4 mM -mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and boiled (10 minutes) to prepare lysates for analysis. 20 mM FBS was added to maintain the cells at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS twice (2500 x g, 5 min) then RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor was added to mix the cell pellet completely. total cell lysate (from 1 109 bacterial cells) was prepared using RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitor as described above. sonicated supernatant (ca. 90 l) was decanted and 50 l of (x3) loading buffer added. a portion of the membrane fraction was resuspended in PBS containing 0.01 mM MgCl2 and 2% Triton X100. the pellet, which contains the outer membrane fraction, was centrifuged (100,000 x g, 60 mins, 4\u00b0C) each fraction was boiled with loading buffer (as above) and analyzed by Western blotting. pBSK, pACYC177, pOmpA, pVAX-1 were electro-transformed into SL7207. bacterial cultures from each strain obtained using the protocol described in Part 3 were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB medium containing antibiotics. the diluted cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. in vivo stability of the six EGFP expression constructs, 1 1011 of freshly cultured bacterial cells from each of the six strains were resuspended in 200 l PBS. each mouse was orally gavaged with 100 l sodium bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acid. one group of mice immunized with SL7207 was kept identically as the negative control. group of 5\u201310 mice were used for each of the 11 recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains. one group of non-infected mice were kept as a negative control. three further groups of 5\u201310 mice were orally immunized with the C-HAOP, O-HAOP or HO strains. the reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of 2 M sulphuric acid. then intensities were determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader. serial two-fold dilutions of vaccinated mice serum were added to wells. g/ml anti-mouse IFN- antibody (AN18 Mabtech) washed 5 times with 200 l of RPMI 1640 medium containing

Strains HP, LP, HO and E were generated by transforming plasmids pHP, pLP, pHO and pEGFP into SL7207. transformants were selected by plating onto LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics, incubating at 37\u00b0C overnight. CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and CP + E strains were generated by electro-transforming plasmids pHP, pLP, pHO or pEGFP into the CP strain. the sequence of the HA epitope (residues 91\u2013261) from the H5 recombinant Salmonella strains were freshly streaked from 80\u00b0C stocks onto LB agar plates containing the required antibiotics. single colonies were inoculated into 30 ml liquid LB medium with antibiotics and cultured at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 10 hours. cells were then collected by centrifugation (4,000 g, 4\u00b0C); resuspended in PBS equal to the volume of the original culture; then immediately used for expression analysis. freshly-cultured bacterial cells (10 l) were immobilized on 1% agarose pads on glass slides, then visualized using a 60x oil-immersion objective lens. both bright-field and fluorescent field (ex. 488 nm, em. 518 nm) images were captured. in vitro and in vivo EGFP expression was quantified by Western blot. the eukaryotic cells were infecting the caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line. DMEM with 20% FBS was added to maintain cells at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS twice (2500 x g, 5 min) then RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail tablets was added to mix the cell pellet completely. the protein quantities were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) 1 109 cells were resuspended in 100 l PBS containing protease inhibitors. pellet was resuspended in 100 l of (x1) loading buffer. samples were similarly boiled (10 mins) prior to Western blot analysis. the protein concentration of each fraction was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA) each fraction was boiled with loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal influenza A virus hemagglutinin antibody. the membrane fraction from the HO strain was used as a negative control. bacterial cultures from each strain obtained using the protocol described in Part 3 were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB medium containing antibiotics. the diluted cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. four replicates were performed for each strain. 6 mice were grouped for each of the six strains. one group of mice immunized with SL7207 was kept identically as the negative control. in vitro and in vivo EGFP expression was quantified by Western blot.
