{"summary": "the elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of many of these complex pathogens provides the basis for rational vaccine design. there is currently no algorithm to effectively identify important target antigens from genome sequence data. however, there is currently no algorithm to effectively identify important target antigens. the elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of important human pathogens, including the Plasmodium parasite, has provided a wealth of data that can potentially be mined to identify novel target antigens recognized by T cells and antibodies. technologies such as conventional protein expression methodologies which are well established on an individual antigen basis often cannot be translated directly to a whole proteome scale. eukaryotic based cell-free systems are also available with wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes and insect cells. up to 75% efficiency of production of Pf proteins in the wheat germ system has been reported [12], [13] but this is still less efficient than that observed with the E. coli system [11] both studies used T cell lines, rather than unpurified splenocytes or bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and neither reported a systematic evaluation of the T cell screening process. we present a series of experiments designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept for high throughput identification of antigens recognised by T cell responses. all four viral (FluHA, FluM, CMVpp65, EBNA3) and one parasite (PyCSP) recombinants could be produced using manufacturer's recommended conditions. a high proportion (at least 70%) of each recombinant was insoluble. IVTT products were either unpurified (whole extract), associated to Polybeads or ProteinG beads, or purified using NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles. loss associated with purification using Ni-NTA or MagneHis was approximately 30% and 80% respectively. only two of the four viral protein targets (FluM and CMVpp65) could be produced in this eukaryotic system. solubility analysis showed 90% of the recombinants were soluble and partial polypeptides were not detected. antigen-specific cytokine production was assayed using IFN- ELISpot or CBA assays. splenocytes from VR2516 immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with unpurified IVTT or unpurified IVTT associated to Polybeads or ProteinG beads. the amount of secreted IFN- by CBA in cultures of splenocytes from VR2516 versus VR1020 immunized mice was significantly greater in cultures stimulated in vitro with PyCSP IVTT purified using NI-NTA resin. no significant antigen-specific IL-10, TNF- or IL-6 responses could be detected upon stimulation with purified or unpurified IVTT products. in vivo stimulation of PyCSP antigen-specific T cell response using IVTT products. no significant difference between responses induced by NI-NTA resin and MagneHis Ni-particle purifications. PyCSP IVTT purified using either NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles. low responses were noted when mice were boosted with unpurified whole extract or unpurified IVTT associated to either Polybeads or ProteinG beads. boosting with PyCSP IVTT purified using either NI-NTA resin (p0.001) or MagneHis Ni-particles (p0.001) compared to Alum control. IL-2 responses were induced only by purified IVTT products. no significant responses were detected for other cytokines assayed using the CBA assay. antibody responses of mice immunized with VR2516 PyCSP plasmid DNA boosted in vivo with VR2516 or rPyCSP IVTT purified using NI-NTA resin. serially diluted sera samples assayed against recombinant PyCSP capture antigen. PBMCs were cultured with IVTT-produced FluM, FluHA, pp65 and EBNA3A purified using (A) NI-NTA nickel resin or (B) MagneHis Ni-particles. negative controls were medium only, unpurified whole extract and whole extract associated to Polybeads or Protein G beads. PBMCs were cultured with IVTT-produced FluM, FluHA, CMVpp65 and EBNA3A purified with IVTT-proteins. negative controls were medium only, unpurified empty pIVEXHisHA IVTT extract, and empty pIVEXHisHA IVTT extract associated to polybeads or proteinG beads. negative controls were medium only, unpurified empty pIVEXHisHA IVTT extract, and empty pIVEXHis the profile of TNF- responses by CBA was very similar to that of IFN-. responses were statistically significant compared to controls for cultures stimulated at 1100 dilution with IVTT products purified using NI-NTA resin (Figure S3A) significant response was found only in EBNA3A 1100 purified with MagneHis Ni-particles. robust antigen-specific IFN- and TNF- responses from human PBMCs could be induced. viral (fluHA, FluM, CMVpp65, EBNA3) and one parasite (PyCSP) recombinants could be produced using manufacturer's recommended conditions. the average yield of each full-length recombinant was 1.15 g/l. purification method was associated with a very low recovery yield. loss associated with purification using Ni-NTA or MagneHis was approximately 30% and 80% respectively. soluble and partial polypeptides were not detected. Western Blot of viral antigen pIVEX HisHA IVTT products probed with anti-HA HRP antibody. antigen-specific cytokine production was assayed using IFN- ELISpot or CBA assays. the number of IFN- SFCs was significantly higher with splenocytes from VR2516 immunized mice as compared to VR1020 immunized mice. the amount of secreted IFN- by CBA in cultures of splenocytes from VR2516 versus VR1020 immunized mice was significantly greater in cultures stimulated in vitro with PyCSP IVTT purified using NI-NTA resin (p = 0.005) or MagneHis Ni-particles (p = 0.003) or PyCSP synthetic peptides (p = 0.02). no significant antigen-specific IL-10, TNF- or responses induced by stimulation with the purified PyCSP IVTT products were comparable to responses induced by stimulation with a pool of synthetic peptides representing defined T cell epitopes from PyCSP. in vivo stimulation of PyCSP antigen-specific T cell response using IVTT products. mice immunized with VR2516 PyCSP plasmid DNA and boosted in vivo with IVTT products. mice were boosted with unpurified whole extract or unpurified IVTT associated to either Polybeads or ProteinG beads. IL-2 responses were induced only by purified IVTT products. no significant responses were detected for other cytokines assayed using the CBA assay. serially diluted sera samples were assayed against recombinant PyCSP capture antigen. data are presented as OD450 at each dilution. in vitro stimulation of viral antigen-specific T cell responses by human PBMCs using IVTT products. antigen-specific IFN- ELIspot responses by human PBMC stimulated with IVTT-proteins. PBMCs were cultured with IVTT-produced FluM, FluHA, pp65 and EBNA3A purified using (A) NI-NTA nickel resin or (B) MagneHis Ni-particles. negative controls were medium only, unpurified whole extract, and whole extract associated to Polybeads. PBMCs were cultured with IVTT-produced FluM, FluHA, CMVpp65 and EBNA3A purified using (A) NI-NTA resin or (B) MagneHis Ni-particles but not with purified products at 11,000 or 110,000 dilutions. negative controls were medium only, unpurified empty pIVEXHisHA IVTT extract associated to polybeads or proteinG beads. negative controls were CEF peptide TNF- responses were statistically significant compared to controls for cultures stimulated at 1100 dilution with IVTT products purified using NI-NTA resin (Figure S3A) or MagneHis Ni-particles. responses were also significant at 11,000 dilutions for CMVpp65 and EBNA3 all purified using NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles. significant response was found only in EBNA3A 1100 purified with MagneHis Ni-particles. response for other cytokines assayed by CBA was not significant. robust antigen-specific IFN- and TNF- responses from human PBMCs could be induced following in vitro stimulation with IVTT products purified by either NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles. protein microarray platform exploits antigen-specific antibodies present in plasma or sera from exposed animals or humans. efficient expression of P. falciparum proteins (93%) has been obtained using the cell-free system. both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can mediate their effector function directly via cytotoxicity or indirectly via cytokines. human studies used well characterized antigens from EBV, CMV and Influenza A virus. the antigens are known to be targeted by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and with defined T cell epitopes. the murine studies used the well characterized sporozoite coat protein, the circumsporozoite protein, from the P. yoelii rodent malaria parasite. the solubility of the recombinants increased to almost 100%. only two of the four proteins expressed in the insect cell-free system could be expressed in the insect cell-based system. newer technologies of high throughput purification can facilitate the purification process, but do not effectively deal with solubility issues. in vivo studies with PyCSP IVTT products confirmed that the target protein was produced and that the IVTT produced proteins were immunogenic. these data demonstrate the potential of IVTT products as a useful tool for the proteome-wide screening of cellular targets of viral, parasitic or bacterial immunity Overall, IVTT products affinity purified through nickel resin or magnetic beads proved the most efficient inducer. plasmid DNA vaccines encoding the P. yoelii circumsporozoite protein (CSP; VR2516) and the control plasmid (VR1020) have been previously described. the plasmid DNA vaccines were prepared using the endoFree Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) XmaI digested pIVEX 2.4d vector using 400 units T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), 25 ng of linearized pIVEX 2.4d vector and 70 ng of the HA-tag insert in a 20 l reaction. positive colonies were screened by colony PCR using 0.2 units/l Expand Taq polymerase in Buffer 2 (Roche Diagnostics) the 50 l PCR reaction contained 0.2 units/l Expand Taq polymerase in Buffer 2 (Roche diagnostics), 0.4 M dNTPs and 0.4 M each primer and 50 ng DNA template. the fragments corresponding to the expected size were excised from a 1% agarose gel, purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) the DNA was purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation improved the yield. all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing before use in the IVTT reactions. the complete open read frames of genes encoding the Influenza A virus matrix (FluM) or haemagglutinin (FluHA), Cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 65 (CMVpp65) and Epstein Barr Virus nuclear antigen 3A (EBNA3A) were cloned into pIVEX His HA vector using gene-specific forward and reverse primers containing specific restriction enzyme sites. recombinant products were purified using two different methods based on affinity to the N-terminal 6xHIS tag. one method used mini-spin columns with a cellulose acetate filter and NI-NTA resin (Qiagen) the second method of purification used the. commercially available MagneHis Protein Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. 50 l of IVTT reaction was mixed with 700 l of Binding Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 20 mM Imidazole and 8 M Urea pH 7.5) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min in an orbital mixer. 1 in 2x reducing sample buffer (125 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromophenol blue, 2% beta-mercaptoethanol) samples were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 mins. membrane washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20. splenocytes were harvested from DNA immunized mice or nave control mice (n = 5) at 3 weeks post-boost. potential toxicity of IVTT products was assessed prior to use for in vitro stimulation of T cell responses. no toxicity due to the unpurified or purified IVTT preparations was apparent. the beads used in the immunizations were washed 3 times with PBS pH 7.0 before addition of the IVTT product. mice were sacrificed and the spleens harvested for use as effectors in T cell assays. unpurified rPyCSP IVTT products were used at a dilution of 1200 or 11000. purified IVTT products were used at a dilution of 1100 or 1200. an IVTT reaction using the empty pIVEX HisHA vector was used as negative control.
