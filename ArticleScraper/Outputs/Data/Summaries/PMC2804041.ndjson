{"summary": "the primary tests currently used to diagnose many parasitic diseases have changed little since the development of the microscope in the 15th century. most of the current tests cannot distinguish between past, latent, acute, and reactivated infections and are not useful for following response to therapy or for prognosis. recent developments in new diagnostic tools have opened new avenues for a vast improvement in parasite detection.

Falcon assay screening test ELISA (FAST-ELISA) consists of using synthetic and recombinant peptides to evaluate antibody responses to an antigen [1]. this technique is subjected to the same drawbacks as most serology-based tests. the dot-ELISA is widely used in the detection of human and animal parasitic diseases, including amebiasis, babesiosis, fascioliasis, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, and trypanosomiasis. the more than 80 RDTs exist for detection of either histidine-rich protein (HRP) specific to P. falciparum or species-specific isotypes of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) only 23 have met the WHO's criteria for international marketing. misuse of antimalarials could lead to the appearance of drug-resistant strains. IPS is a modified ELISA-based assay in which serum containing antigen-specific antibodies can be identified by measuring light production. the antigen of choice is fused to the enzyme reporter Renilla luciferase (Ruc) and expressed as a Ruc-fusion in mammalian cells to allow for mammalian-specific posttranslational modifications. the crude protein extract is then incubated with the test serum and protein A/G beads. many of the samples tested as positive with the LIPS assay were negative using this 15-minute QLIPS assay also called QLIPS. despite the fact that some parasites in south America share common epitopes, it is common to see coinfection with Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species. a significant antibody response has been observed in some individuals carrying Echinococcus cysts [168] or during cutaneous leishmaniasis (http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Leishmaniasis.htm) parasitologists have turned to molecular-based approaches in the hopes to better the existing diagnosis tools. the dotted membrane is incubated with an antigen-specific antibody. the addition of a precipitable, chromogenic substrate causes the formation of a colored dot on the membrane which can be visually read [2] the technique is fast, and cost-effective and more importantly can be used in the field. more than 80 RDTs exist for detection of either histidine-rich protein (HRP) specific to P. falciparum or species-specific isotypes of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) only 23 have met the WHO criteria for international marketing. luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) is a modified ELISA-based assay in which serum containing antigen-specific antibodies can be identified by measuring light production. an antigen of choice is fused to the enzyme reporter Renilla luciferase (Ruc) and expressed as a Ruc-fusion in mammalian cells. this allows the antigen-specific antibody to be quantitated by washing the beads and adding coelenterazine the Strongyloides LIPS based on the NIE antigen showed greater specificity than the ELISA. no cross-reaction was observed with serum from filarial-infected subjects. a 15-minute assay also called QLIPS can be performed in 2.5 hours. despite the fact that some parasites in south America share common epitopes, it is common to see coinfection with Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species [166] it is also a problem in africa, where cross-reactivity exists between filarial and other helminth antigens [133]. antibody-detection tests cannot be used in parasitic infections that do not develop a significant antibody response. based on nucleic acids offer greater sensitivity and specificity over existing diagnostic tests. multiplexed RT-PCR allows for the detection of multiple sequences in the same reaction tube proving useful in the diagnosis of several parasitic infections simultaneously. this is important for proper antimalarial prescription. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a unique amplification method with extremely high specificity and sensitivity. it is characterised by the use of six different primers specifically designed to recognise eight distinct regions on a target gene, with amplification only occurring if all primers bind and form a product [174]. amplification only occurs if all primers bind and form a product [174]. compared to a regular PCR reaction, LAMP is carried out at a constant temperature (usually in the range of 60\u201365\u00b0C) this unique feature eliminates the need to buy a thermal cycler and shortens the reaction time by eliminating time lost during thermal changes. the reaction can be carried out without extracting the DNA from the collected samples as shown in the case of RIME. Luminex technology is a flow-cytometric assay that allows the detection of various targets simultaneously. the assay could identify multiple organisms or different genotypes of one particular organism during the same reaction utilizing very low volume. Luminex was applied to the study of Cryptosporidium [154] opadhyay et al. successfully detected and distinguished C. hominis and C. parvum in 143 DNA extracts using Luminex technology. turnaround time was about 5 hours making this assay faster but also less expensive than a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. proteomic strategy can identify proteins in two ways: bottom-up and top-down approaches. top-down strategies are difficult to quantitate and cannot identify modified molecules. the classic top-down strategy is 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. all proteomics-based diagnostic efforts seek to identify biomarkers that can distinguish between \u201ccase\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d groups. the main limitation of SELDI compared to MALDI resides in the fact that SELDI has lower resolution and lower mass accuracy. the real potential of proteomic fingerprinting is in its use as a discovery tool for novel biomarkers. new technologies such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification and Luminex-based assays have also emerged as possible new approaches for the diagnosis of parasitic diseases. multiplexed RT-PCR proved useful in differentiating drug-sensitive strains of malaria [172]. this is important for proper antimalarial prescription. PCR-based approaches have the potential to help make the right choice for treatment. amplification only occurs if all primers bind and form a product [174]. this method has been successfully applied for the rapid detection of both DNA and RNA viruses such as the west Nile [175] and SARS viruses [176]. in the past, parasitologists have adapted the LAMP approach for the detection of several parasitic diseases. Luminex technology allows the detection of various targets simultaneously. the microsphere beads can be covalently bound to antigens, antibodies, or oligonucleotides. the microsphere beads can be covalently bound to antigens, antibodies, or oligonucleotides. up to 100 microspheres are available each emitting unique fluorescent signals when excited by laser thus allowing the identification of different targets. approach could prove useful in the study of antigenic diversity and drug-resistance alleles and for the diagnosis of parasitic diseases. the need for gel electrophoresis to differentiate the LDR products represents the four human Plasmodium species is eliminated. the high-throughput capability of the Luminex system confers it a clear advantage over the use of labour-intensive microscopy for large scale studies. the next generation of diagnostic tests for infectious diseases will emerge from proteomic studies of serum and other body fluids. this method is labor intensive, low throughput and requires large amounts of sample. other techniques used for the expression analysis of proteins are matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), liquid chromatography combined with MS. the output of the SELDI is a spectrum of mass-to-charge ratios (m:z values) with their corresponding relative intensities (approximating to relative abundance) this technique was initially applied to the discovery of early diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of cancer."}
