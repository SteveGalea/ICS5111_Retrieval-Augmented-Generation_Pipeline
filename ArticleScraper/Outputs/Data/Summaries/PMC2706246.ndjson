{"summary": "Statistical algorithms are routinely used to detect outbreaks of well-defined syndromes. these methods cannot be applied to the detection of emerging diseases for which no preexisting information is available. method uses a visual representation of symptoms and diseases coded during a patient consultation. the places to observe and the databases to analyze must meet certain prerequisites. an outbreak is an unexpected cluster of cases of a certain category, given the past experience in the same place and under the same conditions. supervised methods are used when the pattern to recognize has been defined previously. a second class of pattern-recognition techniques is the class of \"unsupervised methods\" in this class, the patterns to separate have not been defined previously. the challenge is to distinguish them from background \"noise\" in epidemiological terms, unsupervised approaches are suited to detection of emerging diseases. ICPC-2 In ICPC-2, the codes are ranged according to three axes: symptoms, diagnoses and processes. a total of 745 different codes comprise ICPC-2, compared to the 10,795 codes making up the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) each green cell corresponds to an ICPC-2 code. the upper part corresponds to general systems (social, skin, general, hematology, metabolic, musculoskeletal) limb-like structures group the ICPC-2 codes respectively. a number reflecting the frequency of the diagnosis/symptom was observed in a given cell. the color code N(x) assigned to x is defined by N(x) = integer part of [(x/(Max - Min)) 255], where Max and Min are the respective maximum and minimum number of medical consultations associated with the symptom codes corresponding to the image cells. the method relies on the translation of medical linguistic information collected during the consultation into a visual signal. the code counts, corresponding to number of consultations with those symptoms, are presented within a graphic reference frame. this ordering facilitates the epidemiology watcher's interpretation of the images, called ICPCviews. a binary criterion splits the reference frame into two symmetrical parts. the different ICPC-2 headings are arranged vertically in successive rectangles representing a particular system. each green cell corresponds to general systems (social, skin, general, hematology, metabolic, musculoskeletal) pathologies outside the rectangle, which belong to the musculoskeletal system, have been removed. each color is coded by a number reflecting the frequency of the diagnosis/symptom, from white (absent) to bright red (= 255). a total of 17,896 consultations were notified between 1997 and 2004. we selected 4 random subsets of 200 consultations each, corresponding to: the week just before the flu period (week 3/2006), the week of the flu outbreak peak (week 6/2006), and the week after the flu period (week 14/2006) the chief complaints of these 800 patients were coded by an experienced ICPC-2-coding medical secretary. the unsupervised method enables the recognition of the influenza outbreaks that are objectively defined with the supervised techniques. in the second example, we used data from an HED to evaluate whether the technique was able to detect an outbreak of flu-like disease in a timely manner. we examined the ICPCviews corresponding to: the week just before the outbreak (week 3/2006), the week at the outbreak peak (week 6/2006), and the rest of the year taken as a control period. the detection-triggering signal can be the mere increase of an isolated diagnosis code. the signal can also be an unusual association of different color patches on the monitor. we propose relying on the classical supervised methods for the usual situations that happen regularly. a surveillance system based on the network of all Paris region public hospitals collects data on 4000 patients per day. the system was developed precisely for primary care patients, who are the best target for surveillance of emerging diseases or bioterrorist attacks. the same paradigm developed herein could be used with other classification methods, he says. supervised techniques proved successful at recognizing seasonal influenza outbreaks. the method is designed to have the highest sensitivity possible, in order to detect rare, unusual and unexpected signals. the method relies, by definition, on human observers. unsupervised pattern recognition is a prolific field of research that takes advantage of the ever-increasing power of computers and the new methods of machine learning. authors declare they have no competing interests."}
