{"summary": "HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 binds to CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 which facilitate viral entry into the cells. gp120 also readily shed from the maturing virions [2] and forms immune complexes in the plasma of HIV-infected [HIV(+)] individuals [3], [4]. a subset of CD14(+)DC-SIGN(+) DC has been identified in blood, which can model of simian AIDS suggests loss of mDC may be due to cell death. DC that are annexin V-positive could be identified in the lymph nodes of monkeys with AIDS, indicating that the DC in the LN may be undergoing apoptosis. binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN recruits effector proteins to the DC-SIGN signalosome to phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 (p-Raf) [22]. Raf-1 is anti-apoptotic and can in turn antagonize the function of another MAPKKK, apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1) [23] the increase in serum HIV-1 viral loads correlates well with the decrease in number of DC in HIV-1-infected individuals [29], [34]\u2013[37], suggesting that the virus itself or viral products such as shed gp120 may directly impact on DC survival. this suggests that binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN(+)DC may have an impact on their survival, thus contributing to the cellular depletion observed in the settings above. analysis of Annexin-V (AV) and propidium iodide (PI) expression in this population revealed that a very high proportion of the gp120-DC underwent apoptosis following co-culture with activated, but not nave, CD4 T cells. cross-linked gp120 sensitizes moDC for CD40L-mediated apoptosis. moDC were treated for 24 h with anti-His mAb alone (control DC, left panels) or with 25 nM gp120ADA cross-linked with anti-His mAb (gp120-DC, right panels) and co-cultured with autologous activated (upper panels) or nave (lower panels) CD4 T cells for 3 d. data represent mean SD from 5 experiments; **p0.01. moDC were treated with cross-linked gp120ADA supplemented with isotype control mouse IgG (gp120-DC+isotype IgG) and co-cultured for 3 days with autologous activated or nave CD4 T cells. data are expressed as mean SD from 5 experiments. mAbs reduced binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN and inhibited HIV-1 uptake by the DC-SIGN-transfectants. apoptosis of gp120-primed DC can be CD40L-dependent. we studied if exposure of gp120-DC to CD40L-transfected L would lead to same outcome. cross-linked gp120 sensitizes DC through DC-SIGN and MCLRs for CD40L-mediated apoptosis. moDC were pretreated with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs or isotype control Ab before pulse with cross-linked gp120ADA and co-cultured for 3 d with autologous activated CD4 T cells. recombinant gp120ADA were treated with or without EndoH. then cross-linked with anti-His Ab before using to pulse moDC. after gp120 pulsing, moDC were pre-treated with or without mannan or FcR blocking reagent. immuno complexes of gp120 from the sera of HIV-positive individuals can sensitize moDC for apoptosis. the sera were centrifuged through filters with a cut-off point of 100 kDa and the >100 kDa fractions were collected and reconstituted to the original volume. gp120 lost the ability in sensitizing DC for apoptosis upon CD40 ligation. UNEL assays with flow cytometric analysis to evaluate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression as measure of apoptosis. this confirmed that HIV(+) serum-pulsed moDC had remarkable apoptosis. this could be substantially inhibited by pre-treatment with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs or anti-CD40L mAbs. moDCs were treated with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs, isotype control Ab, or anti-CD40L mAb before pulse with HIV serum. data are expressed as mean SD (n = 4); *p0.05 and **p0.01 compared with \u2018HIV(+) serum-DC plus isotype Ab\u2019. moDC were treated with HIV-1(+) sera with viral copy numbers >400,000/ml or 100,000/ml or normal AB serum (control) moDC were treated for 24 h with normal AB serum or with >1000 kDa or 100\u20131000 kDa fractions from HIV(+) serum and co-cultured with CD40L Tf cells for 3 d. endoH-treated gp120 had lost the capacity in priming DC for CD40L-mediated apoptosis. compared with DC-SIGN blockade, pre-treatment of DC with mannan. FcR blockade of DC prior to exposure to HIV serum further increased the extent of DC death. DC underwent DC-SIGN-dependent CD40L-mediated apoptosis. PBMCs from normal HIV() individuals were labelled with anti-CD14 plus either isotype control or anti-DC-SIGN (+) mAbs and analysed by flow cytometry for cell isolation. data are representative of 4 experiments. HIV-1 gp120 sensitizes cultured DC and blood DC for apoptosis after exposure to cross-linked gp120. gp120 sensitizes cultured DC and blood DC for apoptosis after exposure to circulating immune complexes of gp120. serum sensitizes moDC for apoptosis after activation by LPS, TNF- or IL-1, and DC-SIGN(+) cells from HIV(+) blood are pre-sensitized for LPS/TNF/IL-1-induced apoptosis. moDC were treated with anti-His cross-linked recombinant gp120ADA (gp120-DC) or anti-His Ab alone (Control DC), and data are representative of 4 experiments in E and expressed as mean SD (n = 4) in F. P0.001. gp120 ligation of DC-SIGN greatly accelerates an apoptotic programme that is normally induced following maturation. moDC were treated with cross-linked gp120, or with HIV(+) sera. moDC were co-cultured with CD40L Tf cells or exposed to LPS, TNF or IL1. western blot assays were performed to analyze the expression of key molecules regulating the balance of DC survival versus death. moDC treated by anti-His Ab were used as a control DC. p-ASK1 represent results from untreated moDC (lane 1) and DC treated as indicated. #p-ASK-1 represents results from pre-treatment of anti-DC-SIGN mAbs. antibody cross-linked gp120 (gp120-DC) co-cultured for 3 d with activated or nave CD4 T cells. a very high proportion of the gp120-DC underwent apoptosis. cross-linked recombinant gp120 sensitizes moDC for CD40L-mediated apoptosis after co-culture with activated CD4 T cells. moDC were treated for 24 h with anti-His mAb alone (control DC, left panels) or with 25 nM gp120ADA cross-linked with anti-His mAb. data represent mean SD from 5 experiments. moDC were not treated (Control DC) or treated with cross-linked gp120ADA. co-cultured for 3 d with autologous activated or nave CD4 T cells. gp120-primed DC is at least in part CD40L-dependent. we examined the role of DC-SIGN in the CD4 T cell-induced DC apoptosis by pre-treating DC with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs. gp120-primed DC is at least in part CD40L-dependent. cross-linked gp120 sensitizes DC through DC-SIGN and MCLRs for CD40L-mediated apoptosis. moDC were pretreated with anti-CD4/chemokine receptor and anti-DC-SIGN mAbs. we pulsed DC with cross-linked recombinant gp120 for coculture with CD40L Tf cells for 3 days. cells were co-cultured with mock- or CD40L-transfected (CD40L Tf) cells. data are representative of 7 experiments in panel C and are expressed as mean SD (n = 7) in D. deglycosylated monomeric gp120 reduced molecular weight. after cross-linking in dimeric form, they indeed lost binding capacity to moDC. gp120 also lost ability in sensitizing DC for apoptosis upon CD40 ligation. -off point of 100 kDa and the >100 kDa fractions were collected and reconstituted to the original volume with fresh medium before use. the HIV-1(+) sera-treated moDC were identified as a smaller-sized population than the control moDC. these cells were then subjected to TUNEL assays to evaluate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression as measure of apoptosis. moDCs were treated with HIV(+) serum before or after immunoprecipitation with anti-gp120 mAbs or with or without anti-DC-SIGN or isotype control mAbs. cells were harvested and subjected to TUNEL assays. cell death was assessed as the percentage of cells expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) moDC treated with >100 kDa fractions of sera containing either relatively low (100,000/ml) or high (>400,000/ml) viral copy numbers. gp120, circulating as immune complexes in HIV(+) sera, plays more significant role in sensitizing DC for CD40/CD40L-dependent apoptosis. moDC were treated for 24 h with normal AB serum or with >1000 kDa or 100\u20131000 kDa fractions from HIV(+) serum. data are representative of 5 experiments in B and expressed as mean SD in C; ** p0.01. freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(+) blood DC underwent DC-SIGN-dependent CD40L-mediated apoptosis. DC-SIGN(+) cells from HIV-1-infected individuals are pre-sensitized for CD40L-mediated apoptosis. data are representative of 4 experiments. sized that DC-SIGN(+) DC in the peripheral blood of HIV-1(+) individuals would be excessively vulnerable to apoptosis due to their continual exposure to high levels of immune-complex gp120 in the circulation. a substantial degree of apoptosis occurred after they were cultured with CD40L Tf cells, whereas the same subset of DC from HIV() individuals did not. cross-linked gp120 or HIV(+) serum sensitizes moDC for apoptosis after activation by LPS, TNF- or IL-1, and DC-SIGN(+) cells in HIV(+) blood are pre-sensitized for apoptosis. moDC were treated with anti-His cross-linked recombinant gp120ADA (gp120-DC) or anti-His Ab alone (Control DC DC-SIGN(+) cells from HIV(+) and HIV() blood were cultured in the absence of 100 ng/ml of LPS, TNF, or IL-1 for 3 d prior to analysis of cell viability. data are representative of 4 experiments in E. gp120 ligation of DC-SIGN greatly accelerates apoptotic programme. moDC were treated with cross-linked gp120, or with HIV(+) sera. moDC were co-cultured with CD40L Tf cells or exposed to LPS, TNF or IL1. moDC treated with immune-complex gp120ADA were exposed to CL40L Tf or mock Tf, or LPS, TNF, IL-1 for 3 d. cellular proteins of moDC (recovered from coculture) were extracted for Western blotting analysis. gp120-exerted mechanism may account for progressive depletion of conventional DC subsets, as seen in chronic HIV infection. it is unlikely that direct infection and killing of DC by HIV-1 can account for this substantial depletion, given the relatively low frequency of cells that are actually infected. the 100\u20131000 kDa (virion-free) portion promoted substantial levels of apoptosis after CD40 ligation. significantly lower levels were induced by the >1000 kDa (virion-enriched) portion. circulating immune-complex gp120 would be contained in the virion-free fractions. anti-gp120 Abs are present in the HIV(+) serum at high enough concentrations to bind most of gp120 [48] and the levels of anti-gp120 Abs have been estimated to be in the micromolar range [49] for high affinity binding (Kd10 nM between gp120 and anti-gp120 Ab), virtually all the gp120 in the HIV(+) serum might have been occupied (saturated) by antibodies. gp120 levels could be up to 5 g/ml when concentrations of all forms are added, in situations of high plasma viremia. in the same experimental model, DC might have different reactivity over AV or PI in the viability assay. it is likely that DC from different individuals may have different responsiveness to activation signals such as CD40 ligation. pre-treatment of DC with a cross-linked, Fc construct of ICAM-3 was ineffective. this is in accordance with previous reports that binding site for ICAM-3 is distinct from that of gp120 [52] soluble ICAM-3 is not able to compete efficiently with HIV-1 envelope protein or with intact viruses for binding to DC-SIGN [53] antibody cross-linking of DC-SIGN is required for sensitization. antibody cross-linking of DC-SIGN and binding of HIV-1 gp120 [8] or many other pathogens [55]\u2013[58] have been shown to initiate diverse intracellular signalling pathways in DC that lead to different cellular responses. this indeed resulted in more abundant DC apoptosis. gp120 binding activated Raf-1, an anti-apoptotic through its activity to restrict caspase activation. anti-apoptotic p-Akt was markedly reduced whereas pro-apoptotic ASK-1 was very substantially increased. gp120 binding to DC-SIGN activates ASK-1 and further exposure to maturation stimuli results in abundant p-ASK-1 expression. ligation of DC-SIGN, or another pathway that releases inhibition by p-Akt, deserves further attention. we propose that the capacity of gp120 to ligate DC-SIGN and sensitize conventional DC for apoptosis may account for the depletion of DC-SIGN(+) DC. this may contribute to the decreased capacity to mount effective immune responses [15]\u2013[17], [59] and also to increased susceptibility to multiple opport gp120-sensitized apoptosis is accompanied by excessive activation of ASK-1. accelerated activation-induced apoptosis of gp120-sensitized DC is accompanied by excessive activation of ASK-1. accelerated activation-induced apoptosis of gp120-sensitized DC is accompanied by excessive activation of ASK-1. the resultant HLA-DRhigh cell population was >98% pure. gp120ADA and gp120HXBc2 were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates. each contained 5 EU/ml LPS by Limulus amebocyte lysate. recombinant gp120 supernatant with 25 KU of EndoH/ml for 16\u201318 hours. cross-linked gp120 with anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab to form immune-complex (dimeric) gp120. binding of endo-treated and -untreated dimeric gp120 to moDC was compared by flow cytometry. combination of anti-DC-SIGN mAbs significantly inhibited both R5 and X4 gp120 binding to DC-SIGN-transfected 293 cells. HIV-1 uptake into DC-SIGN-transfected THP-1 cells was also used to pre-treat DC at 10 g/ml. the resultant cells were >98% CD4(+) CD45RA(+) (data not shown) Activated CD4+ T cells were prepared by treating nave T cells with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 g/ml ionomycin for 24 h. expression was very low or undetectable on nave CD4 T cells. culture of gp120-DC with CD40L transfectants, LPS, TNF and IL-1 1105 purified moDC were treated with cross-linked recombinant gp120 for 24 h. transfectants expressed high levels of CD40L, similar to those of activated CD4 T cells. after 3 days co-culture, the cells were stained with cychrome-labeled anti-HLA-DR mAb (BD PharMingen, San 5108 PBMCs were collected from buffy coats of healthy individuals. cells were subsequently stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD14. yields for DC-SIGN(+) cells ranged from 5\u201315104 cells. serum and PBMCs of HIV-1(+) individuals were obtained from blood collected for a genotyping study. the whole HIV(+) serum was provided by the AIDS Research Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong. apoptosis of moDC was determined by Annexin V and PI staining as above. apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. moDC could be separated from CD40L Tf and recovered by pipetting and re-suspension. lysate protein aliquots were loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels. gels were blotted onto immobilon P membranes containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk. membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugate secondary antibody. preparation of monocyte-derived DC and treatment with recombinant gp120 treatment (gp120-DC) were generated by culture for 6\u20137 d in RPMI1640. the moDC were then purified by two rounds of immunomagnetic depletion. the resultant HLA-DRhigh cell population was >98% pure. endo--N-glucosaminidase H pre-treated gp120 with 25 KU of endoH/ml. we then cross-linked the endoH-treated monomeric gp120 with anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab to form immune-complex (dimeric) gp120. binding of endo-treated and -untreated dimeric gp120 to moDC was subsequently compared. to block DC-SIGN, DC were pre-treated with anti-DC-SIGN mAbs clone 120612 (mouse IgG2a; mouse IgG2a; all from BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA) this combination of anti-DC-SIGN mAbs significantly inhibited both R5 and X4 gp120 binding to DC-SIGN-transfected 293 cells. 120 binding by pre-incubating moDC with mannan (50 g/ml, Sigma, USA) or 30 l FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyl Biotec, USA) for 30 minutes before pulse by endoH-treated gp120 pulsing with subsequent 3 days' coculture with CD40 Tf. resultant cells were >98% CD4(+) CD45RA(+) (data not shown) the large granular cells were stained with cychrome-labeled anti-HLA-DR mAb. the cells were stained with cychrome-labeled anti-HLA-DR mAb. they expressed high levels of DC-SIGN for blocking CD40 ligand. the survival of gp120-DC was determined by Annexin V and/or propidium iodide staining of cells in the HLA-DR(+) gated population. apoptosis of DC was also examined after culturing gp120-primed DC with 100 ng/ml each LPS (Salmonella typhosa, Sigma, St Louis, USA) yields for DC-SIGN(+) cells ranged from 5\u201315104 cells (i.e., 0.01\u20130.03% of the starting PBMC population) cells were then cultured for 2 h in the presence of 5 mM EDTA to remove the bound mAb, washed, and cultured in fresh medium for additional 1\u20132 h. the whole HIV(+) serum was provided by the AIDS Research Laboratory. 1105 moDC generated from PBMC of HIV() individuals were exposed to the respective HIV(+) serum fractions for 24 h at room temperature, washed, and then co-cultured with CD40L Tf or autologous activated CD4 T cells for 3 d. apoptosis was determined by Annexin V and PI staining as above. the recovered cells were confirmed to express high MHC class II (HLA-DR), while the CD40L Tf expressed no or little MHC class II (Fig. S4B) the recovered moDCs were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail. gels were blotted onto 12% polyacrylamide gels and subject to SDS-PAGE analysis. the rabbit polyclonal anti-p-ASK1(Thr845) Ab was confirmed to detect p-ASK1 expression of HEK293 cells transfected with human ASK-1. day 5\u20136 moDC were transfected 1 day before pulsing with immune-complex gp120. the percentage of AV(+)PI() cells increased from d2 to d3 but decreased from d3 to d4, and further increased to d4. the total AV+ cells (including both AV+PI and AV+PI+ cells) remained relatively consistent between d3 and d4 (58.7% vs 58.4%) cross-linked gp120 had MW410\u2013420 kDa (lane 1 & 2, left panel) monomeric gp120 was 120 kDa (lane 3 & 4) in a separate gel, the MW of anti-His or anti-FLAG Abs was 170\u2013180 kDa (lane 9) 293 cells were pre-treated without or with anti-DC-SIGN mAb clones 120612 and DC28, individually or in combination (10 g/ml each), for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. cells were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 10 g/ml recombinant gp120ADA cross-linked by FITC-conjugated anti-His mAb. cells were washed extensively to remove unbound virus, lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, and subjected to analysis using p24 ELISA kits (Coulter, FL, USA) data are expressed as meanSD of 3 experiments. ent cells expressed HLA-DR (left panel) and the remaining adherent cells that had been detached with EDTA expressed little HLA-DR (right panel) data are representative of 3 experiments, and results were similar for the cocultures of CD40L Tf and DCs pulsed with gp120ADA or HIV-1(+) serum. combinations of anti-His plus anti-FLAG mAbs (panel A) were used to cross-link the gp120, anti-CD4 (clone RPA-T4) plus anti-CCR5 (clone 2D7) mAbs (panel B), anti-CD4 plus anti-CCR5 (clone 2D7) mAbs (panel C), anti-DC-SIGN (clones 120612 plus DC28) mAbs (panel Figure S8 Immunoprecipitation of gp120 reduced p24 levels in supernatants of in vitro propagated live virus. IP was performed by adding 10 g/ml each of anti-gp120 mAbs 2G12 and IgG1b12. DC were mixed into 1 ml of HIV(+) serum (with a viral titer >400,000/ml; Table S1) for 5\u201310 minutes before being ultra-centrifuged to obtain the 100\u20131000 kDa fraction. after 3 days, DC were detached and recovered, and underwent AV/PI staining. cells in each condition expressed as mean SD in B. cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD40 or anti-CD11c mAbs. data are representative of 3 experiments. moDC were treated with dimeric (cross-linked) gp120 (10 g/ml; immune-complex/gp120 or IC/gp120) or conventional DC maturation factors. IC/gp120 induced inefficient modulation of moDCs in upregulation of CD80, CD86, CD83, CCR7, as well as in downregulation of CCR5. DC were harvested from and lysed, and cellular protein was subjected to western blotting for the indicated proteins. data are representative of 3 independent experiments. 4A #1\u20134 and 5\u20137; 4B #6, 4C #6\u201310; 5C #3, 5C\u2013D #1\u20134; 6D #5\u20138; and 6F #6 plus #8\u201310."}
