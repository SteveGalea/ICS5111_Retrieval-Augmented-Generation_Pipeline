{"summary": "57% of weaning calf mortality was due to diarrhea and most cases occurred in calves less than 1 month old. the economic loss associated with calf death in Norway was estimated to be approximately 10 million US dollars in 2006. bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), salmonella (S.) enterica, Escherichia (E.) coli, Clostridium (C.) perfringens, and Cryptosporidium (C.) parvum) along with newly emerging enteric pathogens such as bovine torovirus (BToV) and caliciviruses (bovine norovirus [BNoV] and Nebovirus) there are seven serogroups (A through G) of rotaviruses based on antigenic and genetic similarities of the intermediate capsid protein (VP6). most BRVs (95%) belong to group A, although groups B and C rotaviruses have also been identified in field cases. bovine coronavirus is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. bovine coronavirus is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (2732 kb) the spike (S) protein of the virus plays an important role in virus entry and pathogenesis. villi of the affected small intestine and colonic crypts become atrophic. microscopically, villi of the affected small intestine and colonic crypts become necrotic. virus replicates in enterocytes and progeny viruses are released. BVDV1a, BVDV1b, and BVDV2a are the most prevalent subgenotypes in US cattle populations. most infected animals develop mild clinical signs such as low-grade fever, leukopenia, depression, anorexia, decreased milk production, oral ulcerations, hemorrhagic syndrome, and lymphopenia/leucopenia. ucosal disease is clinically characterized by mucosal ulceration, vesicle formation, erosions, diarrhea, and death. bovine torovirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded, RNA virus. equine torovirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded, RNA virus (2530 kb) bovine norovirus is a non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. genogroups (GI through GV) have been identified based on sequence similarities of open reading frames (ORFs) 2 and 3 (VP2: minor capsid protein) due to high genetic diversity among noroviruses. all identified BNoVs have been phylogenetically distinct from human NoVs. this suggests that the zoonotic potential of BNoVs is very low. newbury agent-1 and Nebraska-like bovine calicivirus form two distinct genotypes. boviruses in diarrheic calves range from 7% to 28.0% depending upon geographic location. there is no evidence of zoonotic transmission among Neboviruses. Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-5 are known to influence the type III secretion system. mainly responsible for Salmonella-induced diarrhea in calves [21,132] infection is much more common in adult cattle and calves. E. coli infects the gut epithelium and multiplies in enterocytes of the intestinal villi. the distal portion of the small intestine provides the most favorable environment for ETEC colonization due to the low pH (less than 6.5) the toxin is highly trypsin-sensitive and induces mucosal necrosis. the toxin causes lethal enterotoxemia in domestic animals. enterotoxin causes diarrhea and intestinal cramping due to its effects on epithelial tight junction protein. oocyst excystation releases sporozoites that penetrate enterocytes. the excysted parasites undergo asexual (type I meront) and sexual (type II meront) reproduction to produce macrogametocytes. zygotes are developed with sporulates (sporogony) generating thin-walled oocysts involved in autoinfection. there are seven serogroups (A through G) of rotaviruses based on antigenic and genetic similarities of the intermediate capsid protein (VP6). most BRVs (95%) belong to group A, while groups B and C rotaviruses have also been identified in field cases. the virus has a very short incubation period (1224 h) [129] and induces peracute diarrhea in affected calves. once infected, the calves shed a large amount of virus via feces for 57 days. the virus replicates in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of small intestinal villi. the S protein consists of two subunits (S1 and S2) and is crucial for virus-host interaction. villi of the affected small intestine and colonic crypts become atrophic and the lamina propria becomes necrotic. virus replicates in enterocytes and progeny viruses are released through a normal secretory mechanism and cell lysis. ytopathic and noncytopathic strains of BVDV are responsible for persistent infection of the virus in cattle. BVDV1a, BVDV1b, and BVDV2a are the most prevalent subgenotypes in US cattle populations. BVDV1c is the most common subgenotype in australia [118] mucosal disease is clinically characterized by mucosal ulceration, vesicle formation, erosions, diarrhea, and death. bovine torovirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded, RNA virus. equine torovirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded, RNA virus. bovine norovirus is a non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. genogroups (GI through GV) have been identified based on sequence similarities of open reading frames (ORFs) 2 (VP1: major capsid protein) and 3 (VP2: minor capsid protein) due to high genetic diversity among noroviruses. noV infection in cattle and molecularly characterize the viruses compared to human noVs. all identified BNoVs have been phylogenetically distinct from human noVs. zoonotic potential of BNoVs is very low. the reported prevalence of Neboviruses in diarrheic calves ranges from 7% to 28.0% depending upon geographic location [19,28,66,100,107]. there is no evidence of zoonotic transmission. Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-5 are known to influence the type III secretion system. mainly responsible for salmonella-induced diarrhea in calves. most common cause of neonatal diarrhea is ETEC stains that produce the K99 (F5) adhesion antigen. E. coli infects the gut epithelium and multiplies in enterocytes of the intestinal villi. the distal portion of the small intestine provides the most favorable environment for ETEC colonization due to the low pH. the toxin is highly trypsin-sensitive and induces mucosal necrosis. the toxin causes lethal enterotoxemia in domestic animals. the toxin is responsible for dermonecrosis due to its high vascular permeability. oocyst excystation releases sporozoites that penetrate enterocytes. zygotes produce thin-walled oocysts involved in autoinfection. oocysts can survive for more than a month in the environment. diagnostic outcomes can be influenced by many factors such as sampling time and population, types and quality of the specimens, and laboratory methods used. fecal sample are examined by microscopy (for C. parvum and Coccidia), bacterial culturing (for Salmonella spp., E. coli, and C. perfringens), and PCR (for BRV and BCoV). fecal samples should be directly recovered from diarrheic animal into a specimen container with either rectal swabs or by rectal stimulation while avoiding environmental contamination. samples of anaerobic bacteria should be kept in an oxygen-free transport medium during shipping if possible. many enteric pathogens are difficult to isolate from the gastrointestinal environment. the virus isolation test is still considered the 'gold standard' for detecting viral pathogens. new methods such as an ELISA and PCR-based tests have been developed. cell culture techniques are commonly used to isolate virus for diagnostic purposes. EM requires a large number of virus particles (approximately 104106 virus particles per mL) in the specimen for virus detection. EM requires a large number of virus particles (approximately 104106 virus particles per mL) in the specimen. a cascade of colorimetric reactions then verifies antigen capture. antigen concentration can be quantitatively estimated as optical density (OD) measured by spectrometry. the membrane-bound method is the most common platform for in-clinic or patient-side tests. oocysts in clinical specimens may be difficult to visualize without special staining. modified acid-fast stains are applied to fecal smears to detect these organisms. feces should be collected directly from diarrheic calves by either rectal swabs or rectal stimulation. blood agar plates, macConkey agar plates, macConkey agar with sorbitol, Hektoen enteric (HE) plates, and xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) plates are used for bacterial culture. slow turnaround of the results (growth and identification can take 2472 h) is a disadvantage of bacterial culture tests. agglutination test is in principle similar to an ELISA. latex particles can be further functionalized by special processes such as amidation, amination, carboxyation, hydroxylation, or magnetization to increase binding stability and analyte attachment. bacterial suspension is mixed with latex beads coated with anti-E coli K99+ antibody and incubated under specific conditions. PCR testing is especially useful for detecting viruses that are difficult to isolate in cell culture or bacteria that require a long time to grow. inadvertent contamination during sampling in the field or processing at the laboratory can be a source of false positive results due to its high sensitivity. primers remove the TaqMan probe from the template DNA. the reporter dye is thus separated from the quencher dye. real-time PCR is similar to TaqMan real-time PCR. fecal samples are examined by microscopy (for C. parvum and Coccidia), bacterial culturing (for Salmonella spp., E. coli, and C. perfringens), and PCR (for BRV and BCoV). fecal samples are examined by microscopy (for C. parvum and Coccidia), bacterial culturing (for Salmonella spp., E. coli, and C. perf arrheic animal into a specimen container with either rectal swabs or by rectal stimulation while avoiding environmental contamination. samples of anaerobic bacteria (e.g., C. perfringens) should be kept in an oxygen-free transport medium during shipping if possible. new methods such as an ELISA and PCR-based tests have been developed. cell culture techniques are commonly used to isolate virus for diagnostic purposes. the viability of target viruses in a specimen is critical for successful virus isolation. IEM has greater sensitivity than direct EM since the specimen is incubated with antibody specific for the target virus in order to agglutinate the virus before staining. EM requires a large number of virus particles (approximately 104106 virus particles per mL) in the specimen for virus detection (e.g., low sensitivity) membrane-bound method is most common platform for in-clinic or patient-side tests. commercial Ag-ELISA kits for detecting BRV-A, BCoV, E. coli K99+, and/or C. parvum in fecal samples are available. modified acid-fast stain contains a more concentrated fuchsin dye and lipid solvent. the sample is fixed with absolute methanol, then stained with carbol fuchsin and 1% sulfuric acid. the specimen is then counterstained with methylene blue or brilliant green and examined under a light microscope with oil immersion. blood agar plates, macConkey agar plates, macConkey agar with sorbitol, Hektoen enteric (HE) plates, and xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) plates are used for bacterial culture. enriched media such as brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and tetrathionate broth are employed for growing and identifying certain bacterial pathogens. slow turnaround of the results (growth and identification can take 2472 h) is a disadvantage of bacterial culture tests. further immunological testing is required for the identification (e.g., for E. coli K99+) [18] or serotyping (e.g., for Salmonella spp.) of bacteria. polymerase chain reaction is a common nucleic acid-based method for detecting enteric pathogens. PCR involves thermocyclic enzymatic amplification of specific DNA sequences of the target pathogen. each cycle includes a double-stranded DNA denaturation step, primer annealing to each DNA strand and polymerization of a new strand. real-time PCR is a method capable of amplifying the target sequence. it involves a oligonucleotide probe labeled with two types of fluorophores. after denaturation of the DNA template, the reporter dye is separated from the quencher dye. real-time PCR using a molecular beacon probe is similar to TaqMan real-time PCR. but the beacon probes form a hair-shape structure because the probe sequence is placed between the \"arm\" sequences. the dye binds to any double-stranded DNA molecule. disease control and prevention in production animals involves animal welfare from the public or consumer's point of view. inadequate feed intake and macro- or micro-nutrient deficiencies during the last trimester increase calf morbidity and mortality rates because most fetal growth occurs during last 2 months of gestation. the major causes of dystocia are associated with large calf size and small pelvic size of the dam. large calves are more likely to have an improper position and presentation in the uterus. insufficient maternal pelvic size also can induce dystocia. calves born to heifers can receive an acceptable level of maternally derived immunity if enough volume of colostrum is ingested within the first 24 h of life. the primary function of colostrum is to enhance the calf's immune system through the passive transfer of both antibody and cell-mediated immunity. colostrum from several cows is often mixed and administered or purchased. calving season can be adjusted to a time when environmental conditions are more favorable by implementing a controlled breeding program. exposure to contaminated environments can be influenced by various factors such as the presence of infected animals, overcrowding, concurrent cow-heifer-calving and contaminated calving lots. the Sandhills Calving System has been reported to be highly effective for controlling calf diarrhea caused by multiple pathogens. the system is based on preventing pathogen exposure during the early stage by segregating groups of calves in the order of calving time and maintaining a clean calving area. the colostrum must be immediately fed to the calf with a milking bottle. the calf pens or hutches need to be sanitized and packed with dry bed. the calves must be separated from each other with enough air space. the affected calves cannot obtain appropriate passive immunity from the dams due to inadequate colostrum uptake during early life. large calves are more likely to have an improper position and presentation in the uterus. insufficient maternal pelvic size also can induce dystocia, especially in beef heifers. the quality of colostrum varies based on calving number, nutritional status, and vaccination of the cow. heifers have a greater likelihood for dystocia, mis-mothering, and poor colostrum production compared to a multiparous cow. cow-calf management practices should be considered for reducing the chances of infectious disease development. commercial multivalent vaccines for these pathogens are available. most vaccines contain either live modified or killed organisms. some vaccines are specific for cows while others are designed for calves. the system is based on preventing pathogen exposure during the early stage by segregating groups of calves in the order of calving time and maintaining a clean calving area. the system is based on preventing pathogen exposure during the early stage by segregating groups of calves in the order of calving time and maintaining a clean calving area. the colostrum must be moved from the calving pen to an individual pen or hutch after birth to avoid contamination with pathogens. the calves must be sanitized and packed with dry bed due to immune impairment of the newborn calves. real-time PCR-based techniques are widely implemented in many veterinary diagnostic laboratories. these methods are highly accurate and provide high throughput performance but sometimes might overestimate the significance of pathogens detected in cases of calf diarrhea. management and control of calf diarrhea before an outbreak is more cost-efficient than treating sick animals after the outbreak occurs."}
