{"summary": "the P-rat is an alcohol-preferring rotational outbred stock of rat that was generated at Indiana University for the investigation of alcohol addiction. both male (24 rats; age, 108 to 399 d [mean, 213 d]) and female (24 rats; age, 130 to 276 d [mean, 189 d]) rats were used in this study. the euthanasia chamber had the same dimensions as a standard rat shoebox cage (12.1 12.1 7.4 in.) each rat was euthanized individually, and all euthanasia was performed between 1200 and 1600. the researcher (DH) performed all euthanasia procedures and was not blinded to treatment group. each rat was allowed 30 to 60 s for acclimation before the initiation of 100% carbon dioxide gas infusion at the designated rate. each rat was digitally recorded from the side to measure vertical behaviors, such as rearing. euthanasia chamber was cleaned with MB10 (Quip Labs) and inverted to facilitate dispersion of carbon dioxide prior to reuse. rats were observed and their behavior was scored from induction until nose down, defined as the point where the head dropped and the nose of the rat touched the bottom of the cage. this behavioral parameter allowed approximation of the loss of righting reflex (plus or minus approximately 5 to 10 s),20. loss of consciousness (defined as the point when the rat's head dropped and its nose touched the bottom of the cage; that is, nose down) was calculated for each rat. the recordings were then scored for the number of rears and the amounts of time during which the rat's head was at or above 5 in. and 7 in. the P-rat is an alcohol-preferring rotational outbred stock of rat that was generated at Indiana University for the investigation of alcohol addiction. male (24 rats; age, 108 to 399 d [mean, 213 d]) and female (24 rats; age, 130 to 276 d [mean, 189 d]) rats were used in this study. the euthanasia chamber had the same dimensions as a standard rat shoebox cage. each rat was euthanized individually, and all euthanasia was performed between 1200 and 1600 to control circadian variation. the researcher performed all euthanasia procedures and was not blinded to treatment group. each rat was allowed 30 to 60 s for acclimation before initiation of 100% carbon dioxide gas infusion at the designated rate. each rat was digitally recorded from the side to measure vertical behaviors, such as rearing. rats were observed and their behavior was scored from induction until nose down. the point where the head dropped and the nose of the rat touched the bottom of the cage. this behavioral parameter allowed approximation of the loss of righting reflex (plus or minus approximately 5 to 10 s) the recordings were then scored for the number of rears and the amounts of time during which the rat's head was at or above 5 in. and 7 in.. the amount of time per rear was calculated by dividing each assessment by the total time from initiation of gas infusion to nose down. serum corticosterone was measured by using an ELISA kit (rat/mouse corticosterone kit, catalog no. 07DE-9922, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) the plates were read at 450 nm on a plate reader by using SoftMax Pro 7.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) concentrations were calculated by using the 4-parameter logistic curve assay on myAssays.com. serum corticosterone (200 100 pg/mL) from previous studies12,13 in a power analysis with an -value of 5% and power of 0.8 indicated that a sample size of 6 was sufficient to identify statistically significant differences between treatment groups. a sample size of 6 was sufficient to identify statistically significant differences between treatment groups. for 30% and 70% VD/min 100% carbon dioxide compared with 10% (Table 1). Results from data collection during euthanasia of rats by using 100% carbon dioxide at various volume displacement rates (% VD/min) 10% VD/min 30% VD/min 70% VD/min Time (s) to nose down Total 177.08 7.91 71.33 7.37a 37.90 9.02a Male 331.33 45.44 73.88 39.36 40.71 42.07 Female 152 0.39 0.04 0.35 0.04 0.21 0.05 Male 0.40 0.09 0.36 0.25 0.04 Female 0.33 0.08 (P = 0.5592) 0.34 0.06 (P = 0.8735) 0.11 0.07 (P = 0.1342) All data are presented as mean SE. rats in the 10% VD/min treatment group had higher mean blood glucose and serum corticosterone levels than the other groups. the mean time for each rearing event was 3.6 s, significantly longer than the other treatment groups, suggesting the 10% VD/min rats were not simply exploring but were trying to avoid carbon dioxide or escape the cage. the rats in the 30% VD/min of 100% carbon dioxide treatment group experienced similar levels of distress as those in the 10% VD/min group. the rats in the 30% VD/min group had the shortest mean time to nose down and the lowest mean levels of blood glucose and serum corticosterone. findings suggest that the rats did not feel the drive to engage in the rearing and standing. 13 of the 40 subjects rated 80% CO2 as uncomfortable (not painful) and 2 of the 40 subjects rated 100% carbon dioxide as uncomfortable (not painful) the 10% VD/min (very low flow rate) of 100% carbon dioxide is distressing to rats."}
