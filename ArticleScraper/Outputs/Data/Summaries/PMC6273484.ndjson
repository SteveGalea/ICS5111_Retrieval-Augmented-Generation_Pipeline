{"summary": "Richard Feynman described a process that allows one to individually manipulate atoms and molecules. this system could be applied to design and build systems at nanoscale level, atom by atom [1,2] and its applications in many areas of wide interest such as health, industry, pharmacy, etc., seem to be unlimited. nanomaterials are accurate and offer a cost effective approach for detection of pathogenic infectious agents in natural environment, food but also clinical specimens. the aim of this review is to highlight and discuss the recent progress and applications of nanotechnology in the medical field (nanomedicine) focusing on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. synthetic nanoparticles can further act as co-adjuvants, stimulating the proper pro- or anti-immunity pathways. nanomaterials may have intrinsic immunomodulatory functions, acting as adjuvants or immune potentiators [17], according to the nanomaterial composition [19], the vaccine-associated nanoparticles [20] could be classified in different types. liposome-polycation-DNA nanoparticles are used as adjuvant delivery system in DNA vaccine studies. nanosized emulsions are those nanoparticles that can exist as oil-in-water or water-in-oil form. nanoparticles can carry antigens inside their core to increase vaccine delivery. polymers Synthetic PLG Biocompatibility & biodegradability entrap antigen for delivery (carrier) to certain cells and sustain Ag release according to their biodegradation rate Toxoplasmosis [33] HIV [34] PLGA S. aureus [35] TB [36] Brucella abortus [37] Antrhrax [40] Plasmodium vivax HBV PGE Influenza Virus [38] HIV [39] Poly ilomavirus [59] NDV [60] Dengue [61] Liposomes LPD phospholipids Biodegradable & nontoxic encapsulate Ag and form virosomes adjuvant P. malarie [40] Influenza Virus (INFLEXAL\u00ae V) [62] HAV (Epaxal\u00ae) HIV [63] ICMV adjuvant carrier P. vivax [40] Emulsions Oil-in- immunocompatibility & non-toxic for DNA vaccines and mucosal immunity Enterovirus 71 [77] NDV [78] HIV [79] ISCOM Quil A, cholesterol, phospholipids & protein Ag Trap the Ag by apolar interactions mucosal immunity Adjuvant S. aureus [80] P. malarie [40] Chagas disease [81] Tetanus [82] Influenza Virus [20] HSV HBV HIV VLP Self- emergence of infections together with rapid evolution of drug-resistant bacteria (superbugs) are triggering increased ineffectiveness of actual therapies used to treat infectious diseases. emergence of infections together with the fast evolution of drug-resistant bacteria (superbugs) are triggering increased ineffectiveness of actual therapies used to treat infectious diseases. a number of nanotechnology-based materials have been studied. the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles allow accurate diagnostics. a combination of positive di-electrophoresis and aptamer-FSNPs label has been developed as a rapid and sensitive method for detection of S. aureus. crystalline semiconductors [94] are composed of materials such as ZnS, ZnSe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe and InP. these characteristics make them suitable for sensitive image acquisition and signal amplification in real time. QD-antibody conjugates have been successfully used in fluoro-immunoassays for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B [110], syncytial respiratory virus [111] or hepatovirus, and HVB, HCV, and HIV viruses [112]. Detection systems based on noble metal nanoparticles, particularly Au and Ag, have been widely studied due to their unique optical and physicochemical properties.

IONP-biosensors have been developed for the detection of HSV-1 and adenoviruses. nanodiagnostic systems will allow microbiologists to perform molecular tests faster and with higher sensitivity. inorganic, organic and hybrid nanoparticles could be divided into inorganic, organic and hybrid nanoparticles. most advantageous are inorganic nanomaterials, such as Ag and Au, alone or combined with various organic polymers. the antibacterial activity of Ag-nanoparticles is well established, although they face certain shortcomings due to toxicity to mammalian cells and limited penetration in biofilm matrices [153] the nanoparticles are indeed potential broad spectrum antibiotics because they can inhibit a wide range of MDR bacteria which have defied most of antibiotic treatments [152] nanoshuttle systems deliver antibiotics to a precise location. nanoparticles are free to move uninhibited into cells. antibiotics can be released inside the microorganism, increasing the therapeutic index and reducing the overall serum concentration. nanoparticles keep offering promising alternatives in the design of effective next-generation therapeutics against bacterial, viral and fungal threats. nanoparticle-based antimicrobial agents can be used in ex vivo applications such as sterilizers for surfaces and devices. the perspective of developing powerful nano-antimicrobial agents with multiple-functionality will revolutionize clinical medicine. nanoparticles can be used for the delivery and stabilization of bioactive drugs as well as antimicrobial molecules, ensuring controlled release of the drug. nano-active systems could lead to more efficient and less invasive therapeutic outcome. nanobiomedicine offers new tools to be applied in the prevention, detection and treatment of the infectious diseases."}
