{"summary": "RNA interference has emerged as a potential approach in the battle against pathogenic viruses (3,4) and other human diseases (5,6). RNAi was first reported by Fire et al. when authors showed a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. siRNAs against the hepatitis B virus polyadenylation (PA), precore (PreC) and surface (S) regions effectively down regulated the target genes expression by over 80% in a dose-dependent manner. RNAi approach offers several advantages for antiviral therapeutics development. siRNA database (26) provides sequences of published functional siRNA targeting human genes. siRecords (29) focused on siRNA data of mammalian RNAi experiments. siRecords (29) focused on siRNA data of human oncogenes. database architecture The database provides comprehensive information of experimentally validated viral siRNAs which includes: (i) siRNA sequence, (ii) family of virus, (iii) virus subtype, (iv) target gene, (v) siRNA location, (vi) GenBank accession, (viii) design algorithm, (viii) production method, (ix) siRNA concentration, (x) cell type, (xii) transfection method, (xii) incubation time, (x siRNAs (23%) have moderate efficacy of 50\u201370%. 32% of siRNAs were less effective with efficacy rating 50%. number of siRNAs for 42 viruses and targeted genome regions. 2hendra virus N(2) 2 marburg virus VP30(2), NP(1) 3 Henipavirus L(4), N(4) 8 Measles virus N(16), L(8) 24 Hepatitis A virus [HAV] 2C(2), 3D(2), 3A(1), 3C(1) 6 Polio virus Capsid(1), 5NC(1) 2 Hepatitis B virus [HBV] S(60), X(48), C(25), P/S(24), P( simplex virus [HSV] U51(4), UL39(4), UL40(4), DNA polymerase(3), gD(3), UL29(3), UL5(3), Vp 16(3), gB(2), UL27(2), gE(1), K13(1), ORF75(1) 36 Semliki forest virus Cold(7), Hot(7) 14 Human coxsackievirus [CV] 5\u2032-UTR(29), 3D(25), 2A(6), 2A(6) a siRNA may affect regulation of unintended transcripts which possess complementarity to the siRNA sequence. off-targeting is associated with the presence of one or more perfect 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) matches with the hexamer or heptamer seed region. s are not specific for both siRNA strands while 101 siRNA have off-targets for the sense strand and remaining does not have any off-target. s are not specific for both siRNA strands while remaining does not have off-target. siTarAlign aligns the siRNA sequence with the respective virus/family reference genomes sequences using either BLAST (37) or Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm (46) the output shown below displays a list of flaviviruses and influenza A viruses targeted by respective siRNA. 'Advanced Search page' allows for more flexible queries using logical operators (AND, OR) external links pointing to the GenBank accession of the siRNA target sequence, Pubmed ID and International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses are given for each siRNA record. around 4000 abstracts were screened so as to select the articles likely to contain relevant viral siRNA information. reviews, general methodological and non-English articles were not considered. articles of siRNAs targeting the host genome regions were excluded. database statistics VIRsiRNAdb database provides information of 1358 experimentally validated siRNAs pertaining to 42 important human viruses belonging to 19 different virus families. database entries contain siRNA experiments based on 71 different cell lines but Huh-7, 293T, MDCK, HepG2.2.15 and HeLa cell lines were mostly used. myocarditis virus EMCV-IRES(1) 1 Junn virus Z(4) 4 Enterovirus [EV] 3D Pol(10), VP1(3), 2C(2), 3C pro(2), 5\u2032NTR(2), 3\u2032-UTR(1), MET-2C(1), VP2(1) 22 La Crosse virus M(G2)(7), L(4), S(3) 14 Epstein\u2013Barr virus [EBV] EBNA1(25), LMP1(10), PR(4), NS(4), 2(2) 13 Hepatitis delta virus [HDV] Delta Ag(16) 16 Rotavirus NSP5(2) 2 Hepatitis E virus [HDV] ORF2(4), RdRp(4), Helicase(2), Replicase(2), 3CAE region(1) 13 SARS coronavirus ORF9a, N-protein(31), ORF5, M-protein(23), ORF4, E-protein(22), ORF2, Spike(18), ORF1 human rhinovirus 3D(4), 2C(3), 5-UTR(3), 3C(2), VP3(3), 3C(2), VP2(2), 2A(1), 3A(1), VP4(1) 22 Yellow fever virus NS5(2), E(1), NS1(1) 4 Figure 2. BLAST algorithm was commonly used to detect possible off-target effects of a siRNA by searching it against the human Unigene or transcriptome database (28). we have also used BLAST (37) with e 1000; q 4; r 5 parameters and found around 13% of siRNA having off-targets in the human genome. 57 escape sequences have 52 substitutions, 2 deletions, 1 insertion and 2 substitution/deletion mutations among 57 escape sequences. siTarAlign aligns the siRNA sequence with the respective virus/family reference genomes sequences using either BLAST (37) or Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm. data retrieval It is possible to perform a quick search based on various database fields. i.e. Virus name, siRNA sequence, target region, cell line and Pubmed ID. increasing number of articles are being published in the area of viral RNAi. in future our main priority would be to update the existing viral siRNA data as well as to include siRNA information for new viruses once appropriate data is available."}
