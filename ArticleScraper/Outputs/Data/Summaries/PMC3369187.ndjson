{"summary": "surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D, are collagen-containing C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins called collectins. they were originally identified as surfactant-associated proteins involved in pulmonary surfactant homeostasis. their primary structures include an N-terminal, triple-helical collagen region, and a C-terminal homotrimeric C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) human SP-D is assembled into a 520 kDa tetrameric structure. the molecules are first shown as monomers and trimers. they are divided into four subunits, the N-terminal non-collagenous domain, collagenous region, helical neck and C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. SP-A and SP-D are able to bind to a variety of microbes (viruses, bacteria, yeast, and fungi), thus acting as opsonins and having direct and indirect biological effects. there is one report of SP-D binding to the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. type A + P2major outer membrane protein Agglutination and opsonization McNeely and Coonrod (1994) Klebsiella pneumoniae + capsular polysaccharide Permeabilizes membrane Wu et al.

SP-D binds to rough LPS via CRDs and agglutinate Escherichia coli. SP-A and SP-D can also bind to rough serotypes of LPS. SP-A binds strongly to LPS from a select species of Gram-negative bacteria. a recent study has shown that through quorum-sensing, P. aeruginosa is able to resist SP-A activities via a flagellum-mediated mechanism producing exoproteases that degrade SP-A. SP-A is not able to interact with peptidoglycan isolated from Gram-positive bacteria. SP-A interacts with the M. tuberculosis cell surface Apa glycoprotein. SP-A increases C1q-mediated uptake of S. aureus. SP-A increases scavenger receptor A (SR-A)-mediated uptake of the bacterium. agglutination has been shown for the mannose receptor on monocyte-derived macrophages. both SP-A and SP-D have been shown to up-regulate its activity. this suggests that SP-A plays a central role in modulating the activity of this receptor. a number of studies have shown that SP-A modulates this process in mycobacterium-infected cells. SP-A enhances macrophage killing by increasing the level of NO. SP-A decreases nitric oxide levels in response to M. tuberculosis and M. avium. NF- is significantly increased in SP-A/ compared to wild-type mice. presence of SP-A significantly reduces peptidoglycan-induced pro-inflammatory response. however, SP-A enhances the pro-inflammatory response induced by rough LPS. SP-A can interact with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) via its N-linked oligosaccharides that results in SP-A-mediated phagocytosis of HSV-1 by AMs. SP-D binds to RSV attachment protein G and inhibits RSV infection in vivo and in vitro. SP-A and SP-D bind to fungi, mostly opportunistic fungal pathogens. the downstream immune response elicited by surfactant proteins can also contribute to fungal pathogenesis. the downstream immune response elicited by surfactant proteins can also contribute to fungal pathogenesis. SP-D gene-deficient (SP-D/) mice are more susceptible to IPA. SP-A gene-deficient (SP-A/) mice acquire resistance to IPA. SP-D, but not SP-A, binds to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. ligand for SP-D was determined to be yeast glucan, -(1 > 6)-glucan. SP-A increases phagocytosis of hypocapsular C. neoformans by murine macrophages. recent data has suggested that SP-D binds to Blastomyces dermatitidis via -glucan molecule. both SP-A and SP-D bind to Coccidiodal antigens, but it has been shown that Coccidioides infection also disrupts the expression of pulmonary SP-A and SP-D. a number of allergic murine models have been used to examine in vivo effects of SP-A and SP-D following allergenic challenge. rhSP-D reduces proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from mite-sensitive asthmatic children. the susceptibility of SP-A/ or SP-D/ mice to the A. fumigatus allergen challenge has also been examined. both SP-A/ and SP-D/ mice show intrinsic hypereosinophilia and several-fold increase in levels of IL-5 and IL-13. STAT-6-deficient mice and in IL-4/IL-13 double knockout mice do not appear to have upregulation of SP-D expression following A. fumigatus allergen challenge. IL-13 decreases SP-D in levels, whereas IFN- has the opposite effect. the rhSP-D shows a sugar- and calcium-dependent binding to human eosinophils, suggesting binding via CRD region. eosinophils from healthy donors show an increase in apoptosis on incubation with rhSP-D. SP-A and SP-D bind to apoptotic cells and enhance apoptotic cell clearance in a nave lung. a significant level of SP-D has been detected in human trachea, brain, testis, salivary gland, heart, prostate, kidneys, small intestine, pancreas. SP-D immunoreactivity has also been detected in epithelial cells of large and small ducts of the parotid gland, sweat and lacrimal glands, epithelial cells of gall bladder and intra-hepatic bile ducts, exocrine pancreatic ducts, epidermal cells, esophagus and small intestine. SP-A is found in human prostate, thymus, amniotic fluid and epithel the gastrointestinal tract was the first site to be examined for extrapulmonary presence of the surfactant proteins. SP-A is localized mainly to the stomach and some parts of the large and small intestine. the presence of SP-D is interesting as it is an organ that is potentially in direct contact with pathogens. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic scleroderma. the levels of both SP-D and SP-A increase in the serum. SP-D content in the BALF even increased to a high of 2363 ng/ml. this immune protein increase along with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests the possibility of this disorder being an inflammatory lung disease. increased alveolar permeability leads to leakage of SP-A into the serum. increased levels in serum SP-D levels in serum have been observed to change during acute exacerbations of COPD. atopic dermatitis and psoriasis No change in serum levels N/A levels of SP-D is seen upregulated in the stratum spinosum layer of the skin in psoriatic and atopic dermatitis lesions. function of SP-D in skin diseases is still unclear. serum is 25 ng/ml (Greene et al., 1999). the physiological levels of these proteins undergo changes during health as well as disease. underlying disease mechanism increases the alveolar-capillary permeability and also affects the basement membrane. smoking has also been reported to affect the multimeric structure of the SP-D molecule, forming lower molecular weight SP-D molecules. in cystic fibrosis, the BAL levels of SP-A and SP-D vary according to the organ involved and severity of infection. the level of SP-A and SP-D in serum are likely to be good biomarkers for the clinical outcomes of certain disorders. a decline in the systemic SP-D in COPD has linked with a better clinical outcome. ALI and ARDS also exhibit similar association of serum level of SP-D and mortality. levels of both SP-A and SP-D have been reported to be upregulated. chronic rhino sinusitis due to A. fumigatus exhibited upregulated levels of SP-D. increased levels of SP-A were observed during chronic rhinosinusitis. the possibility of SP-A being a potential autoantigen in RA led to the identification of autoantibodies directed against SP-A within the synovial fluid. increased levels of SP-D in RA could be due to increased clearance of SP-D from the serum by deposition in the inflamed joint. increased inflammatory response is associated with an increase in p38 phosphorylation. low levels of SP-D in serum and increased expression of SP-D in the synovial fluid may contribute to the persistent low-grade subclinical joint inflammation seen in RA patients. psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients showed no difference in SP-D immunoreactivity to control healthy skin biopsies on the basal keratinocyte layer level. but in the stratum spinosum, SP-D showed higher intensity of immunostaining. the same study also reported that production of SP-D transcripts was not upregulated. the localization of SP-A and SP-D in the female reproductive tract suggests the role of these proteins in the process of reproduction. both SP-A and SP-D can be detected in human amniotic fluid as early as 26 weeks of gestation. however, by 40 weeks of gestation, the level of SP-A rises dramatically from 3 to 24 g/ml. the immunoregulatory function of SP-A and SP-D is also seen in the control of cytokine production within the uterine environment. during human labor, the intrauterine tissue macrophages release excess of prostaglandin F2. along with the release of PGF2, there is a concomitant release of other macrophage-associated products. signals for parturition may arise from either the maternal or the fetal side. the process of parturition is associated with an increase in the release of PGs into the uterine environment. the precursor for PG synthesis is arachidonic acid. the surfactant proteins, especially SP-A, are directly linked to the induction of parturition in mice. initiation of labor is associated with an inflammatory response characterized by an increased production of IL-1 and NF-B by intrauterine macrophages. this increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to the onset of labor. the levels of SP-A is observed to decrease rapidly in spontaneous human parturition at full-term. this is in comparison to subjects at full-term but not in labor. this is in comparison to subjects at full-term but not in labor. umbilical cord blood SP-D levels were twice as high in premature infants when compared to the full-term babies. this increase has been speculated to be due to a capillary leak leading the decrease of SP-D in the neonatal lung. this increases the susceptibility of the newborn to infections or due to pro-inflammatory effects of SP-D. gastrointestinal tract pathology may arise due to ingestion of bacteria during nursing. but when the SP-A/ pups were administered SP-A orally, there was an increase in the rate of survival. infection within the sterile intrauterine environment can lead to the initiation of inflammation which might lead to pre-term labor. corioamnionitis is commonly developed at 26\u201332 weeks of gestation. the association of the low levels of SP-A and SP-D shows the importance of SP-A and SP-D in immunoregulation and primary host defense against pathogens during pregnancy. in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo effects of rhSP-D appear to suggest the existence of additional, crucial SP-D receptor(s) that is specific to the lectin domain. how SP-A and SP-D are involved in the maintenance of pregnancy and subsequent parturition need further investigation."}
