{"summary": "a new guidance arose in November 2014 from information provided by the public health agency of Canada regarding early data indicating a mismatch of the influenza vaccine H3N2 component to an emerging H3N2 seasonal strain. this created a need to update recommendations for the use of antiviral drugs for this year\u2019s seasonal influenza. the concept was then approved by association of medical microbiology and infectious disease (AMMI) Canada. a significant antigenic drift has occurred in the majority of H3N2 influenza strains obtained from ill patients, resulting in a clinically relevant mismatch between the predominant circulating H3N2 influenza virus and the H3N2 vaccine strain. the majority of the predominating H3N2 virus isolates of influenza are susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. a case definition in older children and adults of fever >38 \u00b0C with cough has a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 39.3% for influenza in patients attending an outpatient clinic (10). only the presence of fever >37.8\u00b0 and myalgias correlated with influenza, but with a lower positive predictive value of 41% (11) oseltamivir treatment has been shown to reduce mortality even if treatment is started up to 96 h after the start of symptoms (7,8) for adults with normal renal function, the typical regimen is 75 mg every 12 h for five days. intravenous zanamivir is recommended at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h. oseltamivir capsules may be opened and mixed with sweetened liquids. for children old enough to safely swallow capsules, the capsules can also be taken as described in Table 1. oseltamivir powder is available in 30 mg, 45 mg, and 75 mg capsules. it is available as a powder for oral suspension that is reconstituted to provide a final concentration of either 6 mg/mL or 12 mg/mL. pharmacists should ensure the units of measure on prescription instructions match the dosing device. recommendations from the CDC and the AAP [14] are based on data from the national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group using the infants\u2019 postmenstrual age. 1.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age. patients with severe immunodeficiency may not improve and continue to shed influenza viruses for prolonged periods. repeat endotracheal samples should be sent for viral PCR and susceptibility testing for oseltamivir resistance. if a patient presents with an acute respiratory infection on a background of an influenza outbreak, primary influenza or secondary bacterial pneumonia is possible. erial pneumonia should be strongly suspected when a typical influenza illness is resolving, usually around the fifth day, and then there is a recurrence of fever and productive cough. appropriate antibiotics for community-acquired or nursing home-acquired pneumonia should be instituted immediately, as well as NI antiviral drug treatment, pending an etiologic diagnosis. all HCWs who develop ILI symptoms should immediately be sent home if working, or told to remain at home. guidelines from the institution\u2019s occupational health service should be consulted to determine when the HCW can return to work. post-exposure prophylaxis is less likely to be effective if started >48 h after exposure. in high-risk patients, the use of post-exposure prophylaxis, even >48 h, may be justified. staff in long-term or chronic care facilities is not routinely recommended. the end of a unit outbreak is generally considered when no new cases of ILI have appeared for 7 days."}
