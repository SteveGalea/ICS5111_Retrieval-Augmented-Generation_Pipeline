{"summary": "membrane proteins work as a selective filter to regulate molecules entering cells and also serve in communicating with the surrounding environment. membrane proteins play an essential role in the physiological functions needed for cell survival. nanodiscs are a new class of model membrane, with attractive properties that address shortcomings of other approaches in the study of membrane proteins. the first section gives a brief summary of each method and a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. phospholipid molecules self-assemble vertically as monolayer film at air\u2013water interface. their hydrophilic head groups immersed in the water and their hydrophobic tail pointed to the air. a major advantage of using the Langmuir monolayer system is that parameters such as thickness, surface pressure, molecular area and subphase thickness can be well controlled. rhodopsin is refolded upon compression and retains its precise structure and orientation. bacteriorhodopsin is very stable in most testing conditions (compression and temperature change) ated and nonmyristoylated recoverin adsorb onto a dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine monolayer. interfacial recognition and adsorption of phospholipases A2 and phospholipases C (PLC) to the phospholipid membrane interface are poorly understood. phospholipid hydrolysis by PLA2 resulted in the production of calcium\u2013palmitate complexes. the supported lipid bilayer can confer many key functions to biological membranes. however, one side of the hydrophilic head group is still tightly attached to the solid support. this matters, since integral membrane proteins may not diffuse in the plane of the membrane. polymer-supported lipid bilayers are designed to space the lipid bilayer from the substrate. polymer cushions allow for successful integration of small membrane proteins into bilayers. however, further challenges stem from studies with large transmembrane proteins. ion channels in supported lipid bilayers require considerable period of time. a better alternative has proven to be reconstitution of ion channels into proteoliposomes. liposomes Lipid vesicles, also known as liposomes, consist of a self-closed lipid bilayer. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) and P protein kinase C (PKC) have been successfully reconstituted into liposomes. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) can cause curvature stress changes. ion-channel reconstitution makes possible the investigation of the influence of membrane lipid composition on channel function. cytochalasin B is a potent inhibitor of d-glucose transporter. ions are transported inwards and can form a complex. nanodiscs are a self-assembly of phospholipids and a membrane scaffold protein derived from human serum apolipoprotein A1. it is possible to modify the diameter of the bilayer disc by genetically engineering the apolipoprotein A1 by changing the number of amphipathic helices. nanodiscs are used to analyze the influence of binding substrate on monodisperse receptors which are isolated from the cell-surface membrane. the receptors stay in monodispersed, controllable, predefined oligomeric states in which it is possible to characterize the oligomeric status. rhodopsin is a light-activated GPCR present in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. dimeric rhodopsin nanodisc was separated for monomeric forms using sucrose density gradients. interaction with a single transducin molecule was observed and found to activate the transductin with high efficiency. cytochrome P450 is a membrane-bound protein which is a human hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme. the nanodiscs prohibit self-association as there is only one CYP3A4 per nanodisc. this opens up new possibilities for detailed analysis of equilibrium and steady-state kinetic characteristics of catalytic mechanisms of CYP enzymes. Langmuir monolayer at the air\u2013water interface is a simple method to create a phospholipid monolayer at an air\u2013water interface. a desired amount of lipid or lipid mixtures are dissolved in organic solvents such as chloroform or chloroform/ethanol mixtures. a major advantage of using the Langmuir monolayer system is that parameters such as thickness, surface pressure, molecular area can be well controlled. the lack of a layer comparing to the natural cell structure (bilayer) and the high surface tension of water can cause protein denaturation. a limitation of Langmuir monolayers is that the lack of a layer comparing to the natural cell structure (bilayer) peripheral membrane proteins spontaneously bind onto phospholipid monolayers at the air\u2013water interface by injecting themselves into the subphase underneath the lipid monolayer. kinetics and dynamics of adsorption of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated recoverin onto phospholipid monolayers have been investigated. in the presence of calcium, phospholipid hydrolysis by PLA2 resulted in the production of calcium\u2013palmitate complexes. this suggests that calcium is necessary for PLA2 secretion. gramicidin is unfolded at high molecular area (low pressure) and retains its precise structure and orientation. peripheral membrane proteins spontaneously bind onto phospholipid monolayers at the air\u2013water interface by injecting themselves into the subphase underneath the lipid monolayer. kinetics and dynamics of adsorption of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated recoverin onto phospholipid monolayers have been investigated. supported planar lipid bilayers are prepared by several methods [25,26]. the supported lipid bilayer has polar hydrophilic headgroups facing the aqueous surroundings and two hydrophobic tails that face the interior of the membrane. this matters, since integral membrane proteins may not diffuse in the plane of the membrane. the polymer cushion minimizes the interactions of proteins with the substrate and the polymer. it also provides a soft support and, for increased stability, covalent linkage of the membranes to the supporting quartz or glass substrates. two populations of laterally mobile proteins were observed in the polyethyleneglycol cushion-supported bilayers. polymer cushions have been developed, including polymethyl methacrylate diblock polymer cushions [31], poly(ethylene imine) [32,33] cushions and poly(ethylene glycol) tethered lipopolymers [30], these cushions are mostly limited to a thickness of up to 10 nm. hydrophilic polymer-cushioned supported lipid bilayers provide a higher mobility and homogeneous distribution of the incorporated beta-amyloid precursor protein clea membrane proteins reconstituted in liposomes require detergents wherein purified membrane proteins are solubilized in detergent, then mixed with desired phospholipid vesicles. detergent can then be removed slowly by dialysis, gel filtration or Biobead adsorption. despite these difficulties, there have been many successful cases of membrane proteins reconstituted in proteoliposomes. activity of both CT [40] and PKC [41] is enhanced by increasing the negative curvature strain of the membrane. activity of PKC is instead modulated by nonlamellar-forming lipids via a less direct mechanism. e, and H+/K+-ATPase have been reconstituted into proteoliposomes. ions are observed to be transported inwards and can form a complex. ion-channel reconstitution makes possible the investigation of the influence of membrane lipid composition on channel function. proteins and t-Bid [39], phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) [40] and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PKC) [41] are sensitive to the membrane curvature of the liposomes. this indicates that different phospholipids can cause considerable curvature stress changes in the liposomes. proteoliposomes become permeable to d-glucose but not to l-glucose. the transport was inhibited by cytochalasin B which is a potent inhibitor of d-glucose transporter. ion-channel reconstitution makes possible the investigation of the influence of membrane lipid composition on channel function. nanodiscs nanodiscs are a self-assembly of phospholipids and a membrane scaffold protein derived from human serum apolipoprotein A1. it is possible to modify the diameter of the bilayer disc by genetically engineering the apolipoprotein A1 by changing the number of amphipathic helices. nanodiscs have been used to analyze influence of binding substrate on monodisperse receptors. receptors include cholera toxin receptor ganglioside GM1, bacterial chemoreceptor [57] and epidermal growth factor receptor. rhodopsin is a light-activated GPCR present in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. nanodiscs have been used to study CYP3A4 which displays monophasic reduction kinetics. however, at lower lipid ratio, CY3A4 self-associates and heterogeneous behaviors are induced. nanodiscs prohibit self-association. sec translocon is a membrane-embedded protein assembly that drives protein translocation into or across membranes. the core translocon is formed from a trimeric arrangement of SecY, SecE and SecG [65] the secyEG promoter has 15 transmembrane helices sitting in the phospholipid membrane. oligomerization of SecYEG has been proposed to be necessary to proper function. nanodiscs have been used to analyze the influence of binding substrate on monodisperse receptors. the receptors stay in monodispersed, controllable, predefined oligomeric states. rhodopsin is a light-activated GPCR present in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. nanodiscs have been used to study CYP3A4 which displays monophasic reduction kinetics. however, at lower lipid ratio, CY3A4 self-associates and heterogeneous behaviors are induced. the sec translocon is a membrane-embedded protein assembly that drives protein translocation into or across membranes. the core translocon is formed from a trimeric arrangement of SecY, SecE and SecG [65] the secyEG promoter has 15 transmembrane helices sitting in the phospholipid membrane. the data suggest that both ribosomes and SecA can interact simultaneously with SecYEG complex. but SecA competes with ribosome when it binds to the SecYEG complex. comparisons In the previous section, we have shown that membrane proteins can be assembled into four different types of model membranes. nanodisc technology restricts the ganglioside GM1 oligomerization by controlling the number of ganglioside GM1 monomer isolated by each nanodisc. however, nanodisc technology restricts the oligomerization by controlling the number of ganglioside GM1 monomer isolated by each nanodisc. this is due to the interaction between soluble molecules and membrane receptors inserted in the bilayer of nanodiscs. the nucleus envelope is composed of two bilayers (the outer nuclear membrane and inner nuclear membrane) the nucleus envelope contains abundant ion channels, through which ions and small molecules diffuse between the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and perinuclear (i.e., intermembrane) space. mM KCl conditions, the zero current potential for unitary currents is at 322 mV (Figure 5A) the Cl selective nuclear ionic channel yields a positive zero current potential of +27.3 mV, with a PCl/PK+ ratio of 80. this suggests super fusion of the channel under asymmetrical (150/50 mM) KCl conditions. no ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein solubilized in detergent could be detected. reconstituted in proteoliposomes has a half-life of less than one day. the protein is functionally active when reconstituted into nanodiscs. ATPase activity of the malFGK2 complex in nanodiscs, detergents and proteoliposomes is shown in Figure 7. maltose transporter from coli is one of the best-characterized ATP-binding cassette transporters suitable for various reconstitution techniques. proteoliposomes have shown a low basal ATPase activity because the lipid stabilized the transporter. but the nanodiscs have been shown to be a better medium than proteoliposomes for studying the ATP hydrolysis ability of ATP-binding cassette transporters. ganglioside GM1 incorporated into nanodiscs found reduced protein aggregation. this is due to the interaction of ganglioside GM1 with the headgroup region of the disc which reduces the oligomerization. nanodisc technology restricts the ganglioside GM1 oligomerization. nanodiscs can be used in kinetic SPR studies. the response measured in resonance units (RU) is linearly dependent on the mass bound to the sensorchip. the nucleus envelope is composed of two bilayers. large conductance, voltage-gated, K+ and Cl selective nuclear ionic channels are characterized and plotted as a current\u2013voltage relationship. it has been found that under asymmetrical 150/50 mM KCl conditions, the zero current potential for unitary currents is at 322 mV (Figure 5A), a PK+/PCl ratio is 9.4. P-glycoprotein transporter implicated in multidrug-resistance in tumor cells. no ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein solubilized in detergent could be detected. reconstituted in proteoliposomes has a half-life of less than one day. the ATPase activity of the malFGK2 complex in nanodiscs and proteoliposomes is shown in Figure 7. the basal ATPase activity for assembly in nanodiscs is 10-fold higher than in proteoliposomes because of the decrease in the activation energy barrier. maltose alone has no effect on the basal ATPase activity in nanodiscs and detergents. maltose reduces binding affinity of the MalE\u2013MalFGK2 complex. ATPase activity (40 nmol/min/mg) shows 10-fold increase in presence of both maltose and MelE. nanodiscs system provides a robust and common means for rendering targets soluble in aqueous media while providing a native-like bilayer environment. nanodisc technology is emerging as the favored approach in studies concerning membrane protein complexes."}
