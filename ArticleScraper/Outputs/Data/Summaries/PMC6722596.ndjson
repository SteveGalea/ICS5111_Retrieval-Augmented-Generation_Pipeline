{"summary": "high-mortality and occurrence of EBOD outbreaks almost every year in the last three decades [1,2] are of great public health concern. the unprecedented and first epidemics of EBOD in west africa from 2013 to 2016 [3,4,5,6] and the large-scale re-emergence of EBOD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018 and 2019 [2,7] exemplify the devastating health, humanitarian, and socio-economic impacts and challenges in containing EBOD outbreaks in resource recombinant NP is an ideal target for ELISAs due to their high immunogenicity and abundance in infected cells. NPs of filoviruses are highly conserved [23], and ELISAs based on recombinant EBOV NP antigens have been reported to cross-react with sera from previously EBOV-infected human patients. OV have reported high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of anti-EBOV IgG. recombinant antigens expressed in baculovirus-insect cell systems prevail over some of the problems presented by those expressed in bacterial expression systems. but the antigenic properties of these antigens may be considerably affected by the differing glycosylation pathways between insect and mammalian cells. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of EBOV IgG-indirect ELISAs based on antigens produced by classical virological and recombinant protein expression methods. a total of 1372 individual banked sera collected in south africa (SA) and Sierra Leone (SL) were used. the sera represented specimens collected from 273 individuals in EBOV non-endemic country. ethics clearance for using SL human sera was obtained from the Government of Sierra Leone. 1099 sera obtained from SL patients suspected of having EBOD between august 2014 and march 2015 [36] were used. of those sera 423 were from EBOV RT-PCR confirmed cases for whom date of disease onset was recorded on EBOD case submission form. negative control serum (C++) was the 1996 imported EBOD case from south africa. it tested negative for anti-EBOV IgG and IgM antibodies by in-house ELISA. internal quality control (IQC) data were generated as described previously. supernatant was gamma irradiated with 30,000 Gy to inactivate the virus. gamma irradiated supernatant was resuspended in one tenth of the original supernatant volume. cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2HPO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and lysed using a combination of Bugbuster and Lysonase (Novagen, Merck, USA) treatment, freeze-thaw cycles and sonication. recombinant NP protein-containing soluble phase was collected by high speed centrifugation (15,000 the fractions containing the NP were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra filters. the purified NP was quantified using the Bradford Concentration Assay kit. aliquots were stored at 70 \u00b0C for later use. each 96-well plate had four replicates of positive serum control (C++), two replicates of negative serum control (C) and two replicates of conjugate control (Cc) the remaining wells (A\u2013D 3\u201312 and E\u2013H 3\u201312) were used for testing 20 test sera in duplicate with test serum no. 1 added to wells A3 and B3. plates were washed 3 times with 300 L of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. plates were blocked with 200 L non-fat milk powder in PBS. control and test sera diluted 1:400 in 2% non-fat milk powder in PBS. cut-off values were determined as mean +3 standard deviations (SD) of PP values recorded in SA and SL IgG EBOV negative serum panels. coefficient of variation was calculated to measure relative variability using the formula CV = (SD of replicates/mean of replicates) 100. a serum titer was considered the highest sample dilution at which its PP value was the I-ELISA cut-off for at least 50% of six replicates. a total of 1372 individual banked sera collected in south africa (SA) and Sierra Leone (SL) were used. aliquots of processed sera were shipped on dry ice from FEDL to the NICD\u2019s biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility in Johannesburg, SA by the end of March 2015 for long-term storage and post-outbreak investigations. ethics clearance for using SL human sera in the development and validation of EBOV diagnostic assays was obtained from the Government of Sierra Leone. the remaining specimens were from 676 EBOV RT-PCR negative individuals whose sera tested negative for anti-EBOV IgG by all IgG ELISAs. this serum panel was regarded as SL reference negative serum panel. the source of positive control serum (C++) was the 1996 imported EBOD case from Gabon to SA. cells and supernatant were collected and snap freeze-thawed at 70 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. the collected supernatant was gamma irradiated with 30,000 Gy to inactivate the virus. the sequence verified plasmid (pET-15b ZEbov NP) was used to transform competent BL21 Star (DE3) E. coli. cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2HPO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) recombinant NP was eluted overnight with gentle shaking at 4 \u00b0C in 2 packed-resin volumes of sodium phosphate buffer containing 250 mM imidazole (pH 8.0) Eluted protein was dialysed into 0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (Sigma Aldrich, Merck, USA) to remove any residual contaminating proteins, the purified protein was passed through a SEC 650 size exclusion column s virus and control antigens were added to rows of the top half of the plate (rows A\u2013D:1\u201312) and the bottom half of the plate (rows E\u2013H: 1\u201312) for GP I-ELISA all rows were coated with the commercial GP for which control antigen was not available. each 96-well plate had four replicates of positive serum control (C++), two replicates of negative serum control (C) and two replicates of conjugate control (Cc test sera washed 3 times with 300 L of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. plates were washed and control and test sera diluted 1:400 in 2% non-fat milk powder in PBS (diluent buffer) were added to wells. a specific activity of each serum (net OD) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific background OD in the wells with control antigen from the OD in wells with virus antigen (for NP and WAg I-ELISA only) the mean net OD readings were converted to PP using the equation as previously described. g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and resuspended in one tenth of the original supernatant volume of phospate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2. the antigen was dialysed against PBS to remove the ammonium suphate. the recombinant NP protein-containing soluble phase was collected by high speed centrifugation (15,000 g, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C) the protein was left to bind overnight with gentle shaking at 4 \u00b0C, using a ratio of 1 mL resin to 16 mL soluble protein fraction. ant EBOV glycoprotein (GP) antigen expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells was obtained from Integrated BioTherapeutics (Rockville, MD, USA) each 96-well plate had four replicates of positive serum control (C++), two replicates of negative serum control (C) and two replicates of conjugate control (Cc) each 96-well plate had four replicates of positive serum control (C++), two replicates of negative serum control (C) and two replicates of C was added to C 1\u20132 and G 1\u20132, and Cc (diluent buffer) was added to D 1\u20132 and H 1\u20132. the remaining wells (A\u2013D 3\u201312 and E\u2013H 3\u201312) were used for testing 20 test sera in duplicate with test serum no. 1 added to wells A3 and B3. goat anti-human IgG HRPO conjugate diluted 1:10,000 in diluent buffer. plates were washed and 2,2\u2019-azinodiethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid peroxidase added to wells. a specific activity of each serum (net OD) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific background OD in the wells with control antigen from the OD in wells with virus antigen. I-ELISAs diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) were calculated as follows. DSe = [TP/(TP + FN)] 100; TN = true positive sera (true EBOD patients that tested negative), FN = false-negative sera (individuals that truly are negative for EBOD that test positive) each dilution was tested in duplicate on 3 separate runs. a serum titer was considered the highest sample dilution at which its PP value was the I-ELISA cut-off for at least 50% of six replicates. selection and optimization of cut-offs by the MCT TG-ROC in SL serum panels is shown in Figure 2. distribution of I-ELISA PP values and determination of cut-offs as mean plus three standard deviations of PP values recorded by each test in 273 SA and 676 SL EVD negative sera. the insertion point of the sensitivity (Se, smooth line) and specificity (Sp, dashed line) graphs represents a cut-off PP value (13.53, 16.44 and 26.28, respectively) at which the highest and equivalent test parameters (Se = Sp) are achieved at 95% accuracy level. the overall misclassification costs for WAg (A1), NP (B1), and GP ELISA (C1) become minimal (0.0003, 0.0069, 0.0001, all the three assays evaluated in this study had high estimates of D-Sp, from 97.4% to 99.6% in SA, and from 99.7% to 100% in SL negative serum panels. however, D-Sp for GP I-ELISA was generally lower in the SA negative serum panel (Table 2).

NP I-ELISAs included control antigens, higher GP I-ELISA test values in EBOV negative serum panels and consequently higher PP cut-off values. binding-antibody levels should be expressed in relative rather than absolute terms. the first ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to EBOV were based on whole antigen prepared from infected cell lysate [40] results of viral inactivation protocols evaluated in our study indicate that they do not alter detectable levels of anti EBOV-IgG. the ELISAs based on recombinant antigen based ELISAs provide a safe and reliable testing platform. s have a potential to replace traditional serological diagnostic methods. simple viral inactivation protocols do not alter measurable levels of anti EBOV-IgG."}
