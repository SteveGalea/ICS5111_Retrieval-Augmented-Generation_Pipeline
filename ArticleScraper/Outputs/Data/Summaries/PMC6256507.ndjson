{"summary": "IBV occurs as 6 genotypes with a total of 34 lineages based on the spike S gene. the IBV positive-sense, single-stranded 5 capped RNA genome with circa 27 kb codes. libraries and sequencing kits used were by Illumina (Nextera XT Index and Nextera XT DNA) reads were obtained with a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) using the NextSeq 500 mid-output v2 kit (150 bp) the population of genome variants, including a dominant sequence subjected to natural selection and drift, showed a rather high homogeneity on this D274 sample. the immunity for IBV is not based only on the humoral response to this protein (8, 9), the availability of full genomes for vaccine strains is core to accurately predicting protection markers."}
