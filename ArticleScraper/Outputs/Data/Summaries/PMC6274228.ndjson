Celastrol is the bioactive component responsible for exhibiting the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. chinoline and tetrandrine have been reported to contribute their anti-tumor effect through autophagy. both compounds are able to modulate cytokine expression and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. the role of autophagy modulation in such alteration of glucose and Ca2+ levels remains elusive. the anti-tumor properties of plumbagin were attributed to the autophagy induction ability of the compound. the compound also triggered apoptosis and autophagic cell death in lung cancer and tongue squamous carcinoma cells. cortex magnoliae officinalis (Hou Po) helps remove chest stuffiness due to phlegm accumulation, and relieves distension. the bioactive component, magnolol, alleviated acute pain and endothelial damage stimulated by inflammation. evodiamine induced autophagic cell death in glioblastoma by quenching calcium/JNK signaling and apoptosis of gastric adenocarcinoma cells. evodiamine regulated autophagy through a complex molecular network. further investigations correlating autophagy to their traditional use should be undertaken. piperlongumine and its derivatives inhibit pro-inflammatory mediator synthesis. these compounds remove oxidative stress and prevent cardiac damage caused by ROS. they also inhibit platelet aggregation and are used as crude drugs to promote peripheral blood circulation. the main bioactive component of Rhizoma curcumae longae possesses a unique structure amongst other active constituents extracted from the herb. the compound has been associated with the capability of preventing inflammation [355], tumor progression [356], and oxidative stress accumulation [357]. tanshinone IIA inhibited macrophagic NF-B activation via the ERK1/2, p38 and JNK pathways. calcineurin regulated AMPK-dependent autophagy of cardiomyocytes upon oxidative stress [369] implying the process may underlie the cardioprotective function of Radix salviae miltiorrhizae. ligustrazine has been reported to induce autophagy. it was associated with cytotoxic effects toward hepatocellular carcinoma. ligustrazine-induced autophagic effect has also been demonstrated in protecting the kidney from neurotoxicity. the bufalin-induced autophagic cell death effectively suppressed colon cancer cell proliferation via JNK activation [167], and the PTEN/AKT pathways [381]. gambogic acid is the major active ingredient of Garcinia hanburyi biologically alleviating pain, inflammation, and fever [384]. radiation polygalae (RP) (Yuan zhi) is commonly prescribed in many classical decoctions such as \"Kai Xin San\" [388], \"Ding Zhi Wan\" [389] for the treatment of forgetfulness [390], anxiety [391], insomnia or depression [392]. RP may play its traditional sedative effect through degradation of unwanted proteins or organelles by autophagy. caulis polygoni multiflori (Shou wu teng) has been prescribed for nourishing blood, tranquilizing the mind and dispersing wind to treat insomnia, numbness of the skin and rheumatism in traditional Chinese medicine. ganoderic acid C2 could reduce accumulation of mutant huntingtins in PC-12 cells, alleviate neurotoxicity and behavioral deficits. anthraquinones possessed similar chemical structures but different bioactivities. emodin, the most abundant anthraquinone in rhubarb, inhibits cellular proliferation and prevents metastasis of cancers through apoptosis. Schisandra total lignin (STL), the major active ingredient of Fructus schisandrae, delayed mouse brain aging by attenuating apoptosis. in vivo experiments further demonstrated STL inhibited the d-galactose-induced brain tissue aging through regulating autophagy. current pharmacological studies have confirmed the neuroprotective and autophagic role of Semen ziziphi spinosae. autophagy was highly correlated to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, which was important for normal function of brain. vitamin E succinate (VES) was proved to induce autophagy via the inhibition of mTOR [174] the active component of Nelumbo nucifera, neferine, was identified as a novel autophagic enhancer. it facilitates the degradation of mutant neurodegenerative disease proteins in vitro. sedative TCMs may play protective role in neurodegenerative diseases. a phase I trial was performed to evaluate the combined use of HCQ with temozolamide [421] and radiation in glioblastoma patients. a phase I trial of 2-deoxyglucose [423] showed a reduction in autophagy, suggesting the role of autophagy in cancer therapy. the different responses of neurons and glia to autophagy or drug must be considered in clinical trial evaluations. it is important to clarify the potential discrepancies between selective and non-selective autophagy in terms of their response towards different therapeutic agents. early cancer development is likely to be prevented by autophagy induction. autophagy modulators are therapeutically beneficial to a broad range of disorders which are consistent with their traditional usage. a plethora of CHMs having similar potential in preventing cancer progression have not been studied before. rhizae, Rhizoma chuanxiong, Garcinia hanburyi, Radix plumbaginis zeylanicae, and Fructus evodiae can inhibit autophagic cell death of influenza-infected cells. this provides insight to the search of CHMs sharing such anti-viral properties. the actions of CHM are usually multi-targeting [307,438] making them suitable medications for autophagy-related disorders which are usually polysymptomatic. positive findings could widen the scope of CHM applications."}
