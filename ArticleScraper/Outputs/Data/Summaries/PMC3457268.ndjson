{"summary": "ISA is a significant disease of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) it was first identified in Norway in 1984. it is caused by a negative-sense, segmented single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus in the Orthomyxoviridae family (37) ISA is a relatively novel disease with poorly understood pathogenesis. symptoms include severe anemia and hemorrhagic liver necrosis. other common findings include increased hemophagocytosis, ascites, petechia. the viral attachment protein for orthomyxoviruses, the hemagglutinin (HA), attaches to sialic acid-containing receptors. this tropism is determined by the distribution of Neu4,5Ac (4-O-acetylated sialic acids), the preferred receptor for the virus (20. cells were washed twice in ice-cold L-15 and scraped off using cell scrapers. Tween 80 was then added under constant stirring to a final concentration of 0.125% (vol/vol) at +4\u00b0C and stirred for 5 min. diethyl ether was then added to the preparation, further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. s from heart, liver, kidney, anterior kidney, gill, spleen, pseudobranch, eye, brain, esophagus, pylori, hind gut, skin, and muscle were either collected in 10% buffered formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the fish were challenged as in experiment 1 and sampled at days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 22 p.i. cell concentration was adjusted to 106 cells ml1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the preparations were made by centrifugation of 100 l of cell suspension at 1,500 rpm for 5 min in a cytocentrifuge. sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were prepared on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. ISAV HE antigen (100 HAU ml1) in TBS for 1 h followed by detection of bound antigen with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to ISAV HE (12) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig amplified detection system (EnVision+) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. the sections were pretreated with 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was performed. cytospot preparations, cryosections, or blood smears were fixed in either cold acetone or 10% formalin for 10 min. a monoclonal antibody to ISAV HE (12), a rabbit antibody to recombinant ISAV NP (1) were used as primary antibodies. infected cell cultures in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks were harvested following 3 to 5 days of incubation. cells were washed twice in ice-cold L-15 and scraped off using cell scrapers. the HE protein was then extracted using Tween 80 and ether (36) peripheral blood was collected in heparin, followed by autopsy. tissue from heart, liver, kidney, anterior kidney, gill, spleen, pseudobranch, eye, brain, esophagus, pylori, hind gut, skin, and muscle were either collected in 10% buffered formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the leukocyte fractions were obtained by using a discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare) as previously described (3). the cell concentration was adjusted to 106 cells ml1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) nonspecific blocking was performed by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6) sections were then incubated with ISAV HE antigen (100 HAU ml1) in TBS for 1 h. sections were pretreated with 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min for saponification. immunofluorescent virus histochemistry was performed by incubating sections with ISAV HE antigen (100 HAU ml1) for 1 h, followed by detection of bound antigen using a monoclonal antibody to ISAV HE and a rabbit antibody to recombinant ISAV NP (1). IHC revealed strong positive ISAV staining confined to the endothelial layer of all types of vessels in all organs, including capillaries, veins, and arteries. the location of stained ISAV in the endothelial cells was sometimes confined only to the nucleus but most frequently present in the cytoplasm. anti-ISAV HE and anti-ISAV NP antibodies revealed abundant virus antigen associated with the surface of most RBCs. it appears that ISAV produced by vessel endothelium attaches to the surface but does not infect or replicate within the RBCs. Tissue samples from experiments 2 and 3 and cytospin preparations from experiment 2 were examined by IHC. the cytospin preparations showed approximately 0.1% of the leukocytes positive for ISAV antigen at day 2 p.i., with no positive staining observed in endothelial cells in tissue sections at this time point. lymphocyte depletion was observed in experiment 2 by differential counting. all organs investigated contained large amounts of ISAV confined to endothelial cells of the vasculature. however, in the hemorrhagic, coagulative necrosis in liver and kidney, no ISAV was detected by IHC. in situ hemadsorption was observed in some cases, as was in situ RBC agglutination. ISAV pattern of virus attachment largely explains endotheliotropism in salmon. endothelial cells and RBCs are the main virus target cells during ISAV infection. the ISAV receptor was found on endothelial cells and on RBCs. AV sialic acid receptor in tissue from healthy salmon using ISAV preparations. labeled cells (brown) were present in all organs. hemagglutination with horse erythrocytes and virus binding to horse serum did not inhibit the reaction. the combined data of this work and those presented by Helleb et al. (20) suggest that ISAV HE binds to 4-O-acetylated sialic acids. the mechanism by which the virus is released from host cells is unknown. endothelial cells are the main target cells of ISAV infection. tissues from experimentally infected Atlantic salmon were examined at 11 days p.i. by immunohistochemistry (IHC) this is when virus load is expected to be at its maximum. IFAT labeling of blood smears with anti-ISAV HE and anti-ISAV NP antibodies revealed abundant virus antigen associated with the surface of most RBCs. no expression of viral proteins was detected in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus of RBCs. ISAV infection is detected in leukocytes and gill epithelium. cytospin preparations showed 0.1% of the leukocytes positive for ISAV antigen at day 2 p.i., with no positive staining observed in endothelial cells in tissue sections at this time point. the results indicate that there may be a primary replication stage in gill epithelial cells and in leukocytes. results from experimental infections do not always correlate with natural infections. infected endothelial cells (red) were detected adjacent to hemorrhagic liver necrosis (HCN) (CV, central vein) (a) and tubular necrosis (TN) in kidney (b). endothelial cells and RBCs are main virus target cells during ISAV infection. we did not find any changes in the distribution, suggesting that infected endothelium was intact. nor did we find any indications that the receptor was more or less abundant in tissues from ISAV-infected fish. serum from either horse or guinea pig, either of which predominantly contains 4-O-acetylated sialic acids, blocked the reaction while no inhibition was observed with native rat, pig, or cattle serum. the combined data of this work and those presented by Helleb et al. (20) suggest that ISAV HE binds to 4-O-acetylated sialic acids. IFAT staining of uninfected heart shows greater presence of ISAV receptor at the luminal side (arrows) of endothelial cells. ISA is characterized by severe anemia and circulatory disturbances. gill epithelial infection could be sufficient to establish the systemic infection that appeared similar regardless of immersion or i.p. challenge. however, the level of gill epithelial infection was low, and this opens the possibility that other infection routes are important. early endothelial infection and viremia are key events during systemic influenza virus infection in several birds (25, 49) and have also been demonstrated in cats (40, 42). stressed endothelium alters its permeability function and can express molecules which may promote recruitment of inflammatory cells. several viruses have coevolved with bony fishes, including paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses. some key functional activities characteristic of orthomyxoviruses have been retained through evolution. similarities between ISA pathogenesis in Atlantic salmon and systemic phase of influenza virus infection in domestic poultry. Atlantic salmon correlated this with the pathology."}
