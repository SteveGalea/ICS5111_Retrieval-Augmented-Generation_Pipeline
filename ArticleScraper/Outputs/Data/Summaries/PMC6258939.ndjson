{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of the disease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. this single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus has a genome size of approximately 15 kb and belongs to the genus Porarterivirus of the family Arteriviridae. other representative members within the family are equine arteritis virus (EAV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus p9, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12, involve a 1 ribosome frameshift (14\u201316) the matrix screening was performed by cotransforming into strain Y2H Gold containing prey vectors with the respective PRRSV nsps on high-stringency QDO plates containing X--Gal and aureobasidin A. PRRSV nsp2 possesses cysteine protease activity that cleaves the nsp2-nsp3 junction site during replicase polyprotein maturation (25\u201327) it is also predicted to interact with nsp3, according to studies of the EAV counterparts (18, 19). nsp5 is the functionally least known membrane protein, with limited information showing that it can induce autophagic death of transfected cells. PRRSV nsp10 encodes the function of an RNA helicase that is implicated in subgenomic-mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis. the enzyme is predicted to comprise four domains in succession. nsp9 and nsp10 have been shown to be key virulence determinants. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and co-IP are the most commonly used methods for investigating protein-protein interactions (PPI) of nidoviruses (e.g., coronaviruses) two-hybrid screening of protein-protein interactions among PRRSV nsps. genes coding for individual nsps (nsp1 to nsp12) were cloned into both the prey and bait plasmids. each interaction pair was examined from both directions. nsp1-nsp1, nsp12-nsp12, nsp2-nsp1, nsp2-nsp1, and nsp7-nsp9 have been reported in PRRSV. however, these interactions were mainly characterized by using in vitro assays and have not been tested within mammalian cells. the tag was placed at the N terminus, as we found that the subcellular localization pattern of one of the derivatives was affected by the tag at the N terminus. the expression and subcellular localization of these proteins were examined in BHK21 cells, a cell line that supports PRRSV replication in vitro. an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was carried out to detect the individual proteins with antibodies to the epitope tags at 18 to 24 h posttransfection. nsps of PRRSV JXwn06 used in the study for plasmid construction Protein nucleotide positions Position in polyprotein protein length (aa) nsp1 190\u2013729 M1\u2013M180 180 nsp1 730\u20131338 A181\u2013G383 203 nsp2 1339\u20134836 A384\u2013G1549 1,166 nsp3 4837\u20135526 G1550\u2013E1779 s carrying genes for individual nsps and derivatives were transfected into BHK-21 cells. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with proper antibodies to the HA epitope. the cells were stained with DAPI (blue) and examined by confocal microscopy. we failed to detect an interaction with nsp1, nsp1, nsp4, and nsp11. the interaction with nsp7 was not further pursued here. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to co-IP analysis. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, stained with the appropriate antibodies to epitope tags. nsp10 and nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, nsp9, and nsp12. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, stained with the appropriate antibodies to epitope tags. nsp5 were poorly capable of finding the full-length nsp9 (Fig. 4F, Fig. 5E, and Fig. 6H, top row) to gain further evidence that nsp9 can interact with these transmembrane proteins within cells, we performed mutagenesis studies. we modeled the PRRSV nsp9 structure with I-TASSER (59) fragments nsp9(1\u2013229)-HA and nsp9(46\u2013685)-HA exhibited cytoplasmic distribution as puncta or speckles. when coexpressed with either nsp2, nsp3, or nsp5, the fragment underwent massive redistribution. nsp9(1\u2013229)-HA did not respond well to either nsp2, nsp3, or nsp5. interactions between nsp10 and transmembrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 were verified by the co-IP assay. nsp10 colocalized with nsp1 in the cytoplasm, but not with nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, or nsp12. HA-nsp10(1\u2013100) and HA-nsp10(101\u2013441) contain the disrupted 1B domain. the other two constructs contain the disrupted 1B domain. nsp2 did not relocalize HA-nsp10(1\u2013127) and HA-nsp10(101\u2013441). PRRSV nsp12 can relocate the N-terminal region of nsp10. nsp10 helicase domain is the common region for binding these four proteins. nsp10 helicase domain is only for nsp12, while the N-terminal domain is only for nsp12. nsp9-FLAG responded to HA-nsp10(128\u2013441), moving out of the nucleus to become colocalized in the cytoplasm. nsp12 is highly conserved among PRRSV strains, but its function in the virus life cycle has remained enigmatic. co-IP assay could confirm its interactions with nsp1. nsp2 (Fig. 8B), nsp9 (Fig. 6F and G), nsp10 (Fig. 7G), and nsp11 (Fig. 8C) failed to detect an interaction with nsp1, nsp3 and nsp5. the interaction with nsp6 was not tested by co-IP due to its very small size (only 16 aa) y2H screening showed nsp2 to mainly interact with nsp9, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12, in addition to nsp3. nsp2 colocalized well with nsp12 and nsp3 (Fig. 9E) nsp1 was found to interact with nsp1, nsp7, nsp9, nsp11, and nsp12 in the Y2H system. the co-IP and cotransfection experiments failed to confirm these interactions. however, they did not colocalize within transfected cells. coexpression of nsp2 and nsp3 was judged by characteristic dispersed puncta formation. nsp5 was found to be localized to these puncta. it is possible that efficient recruitment of nsp2 and nsp3 takes place only on replication-associated membrane structures. coexpression of nsp2 and nsp3 does not increase interaction efficiency with full-length nsp9 and nsp3. the coexpression induced typical dispersed puncta in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9H; Fig. 10B, top row) that resembled the structures seen in PRRSV-infected cells. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed, stained with appropriate antibodies to epitope tags and examined by confocal microscopy. nsp1 and nsp12 were two novel self-interacting nsps, in addition to the already reported nsp1. the number of PRRSV self-interacting nsps was expanded to at least 5: nsp1, nsp1, nsp9, and nsp12 by co-IP. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and either subjected to co-IP analysis. the map suggests that the three transmembrane proteins may serve as scaffolding proteins to recruit ORF1b-encoded core replication proteins. a previous study reported the association of nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp8 with viral RTC. nsp2 and nsp9 were colocalized well with dsRNA. the majority of nsps are recruited to viral RTC during PRRSV infection. MARC-145 cells grown on coverslips were infected with HP-PRRSV JXwn06 at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 h, the cells were fixed and doubly stained with appropriate antibodies to PRRSV nsps or dsRNAs and examined by confocal microscopy. a total of 36 interactions were identified as positive in a pairwise matrix. 19 interactions showed one directionality (Fig. 1C), indicating an influence of fusion domains on the interactions. nsp9 and nsp12 have the largest number of connections. the second-most-connected proteins were nsp2, nsp5, and nsp11. the proteins with few identified binding partners were nsp1, nsp3, nsp6, and nsp8. two major localization patterns could be discerned for the PRRSV nsps. the replicase proteins nsp1, nsp1, nsp1, nsp4, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp11 were mostly localized in the nucleus, but with diffusion in the cytoplasm when expressed alone. 4 5527\u20136138 G1780\u2013E1983 204 nsp5 6139\u20136648 G1984\u2013E2153 170 nsp6 6649\u20136696 G2154\u2013E2169 16 nsp7 6697\u20137473 S2170\u2013E2428 259 nsp8 7474\u20137611 A2429\u2013C2473 45 nsp9 7474\u20139527 A2429\u2013E3133 685 nsp9 and nsp10 represent key enzymes for viral RNA synthesis. y2H screening identified 9 binding partners for nsp9. nsp1, nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, nsp7, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to co-IP analysis. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, stained with the appropriate antibodies to epitope tags. the percentages of cells showing relocalization and colocalization were determined. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed, stained with appropriate antibodies to epitope tags. cells were transfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, stained with appropriate antibodies to epitope tags, and examined by confocal microscopy. nsp9(230\u2013685)-HA includes the complete putative RdRp domain. nsp9(1\u2013229)-HA represents the nsp8 portion and nsp9(46\u2013685)-HA represents the ORF1b-coded portion of nsp9. nsp9(1\u2013229)-HA was found mainly in the nucleus. fragment [nsp9(230\u2013685)-HA] underwent massive redistribution. it was absent from the nucleus and relocalized to the cytoplasm. nsp9(1\u2013229)-HA did not respond well to either nsp2, nsp3, or nsp5. nsp10 was found to colocalize with nsp1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7H, top row), but not with nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, or nsp12. in the cotransfected cells, nsp10 was found to colocalize with nsp1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7H, top row), but not with nsp2, nsp3, nsp HA-nsp10(1\u2013127) and HA-nsp10(128\u2013441) contain an undisrupted 1B domain. in some cells, they behaved just like wild-type (WT) HA-nsp10. in another population, they exhibited nuclear localization, but with cytoplasmic puncta. nsp12 can relocate the N-terminal region of nsp10 [nsp10(1\u2013127)] together, the results suggest that the nsp10 helicase domain is the common region for binding these four proteins, while the N-terminal domain is only for nsp12. however, it is hard to judge the interaction within cells due to their similar distribution patterns. nsp9-FLAG responded to HA-nsp10(128\u2013441), moving out of the nucleus to become colocalized in the cytoplasm. nsp12 is highly conserved among PRRSV strains, but its function in the virus life cycle has remained enigmatic. the co-IP assay could confirm its interactions with nsp1 (Fig. 8A), nsp2 (Fig. 8B), nsp nsp12 colocalized well with membrane proteins nsp2 (Fig. 8F), nsp3 (Fig. 8G) and nsp5 (Fig. 8I) nsp12 colocalized well with the membrane proteins nsp2 (Fig. 8F), nsp3 (Fig. 8G) and nsp5 (Fig. 8I) membrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 are thought to serve as a platform to recruit core nsps to viral RTC (18, 19) nsp2 mainly interacts with nsp9, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12, in addition to nsp3. nsp2 colocalized well with nsp12 (Fig. 8F) and nsp cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting. at 18 to 24 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed, stained with appropriate antibodies to epitope tags. co-IP and cotransfection experiments failed to confirm interactions. membrane proteins nsp2, nsp3 and nsp5 likely form a subnetwork. coexpression does not enable interaction with full-length nsp9 or nsp10 in transfected cells. it is possible that efficient recruitment of nsp2 and nsp3 takes place only on replication-associated membrane structures. coexpression of nsp2 and nsp3 does not increase interaction efficiency with full-length nsp9 and nsp10. the coexpression did not significantly increase the relocation efficiency of either the full-length nsp9 or nsp10. neither nsp2 nor nsp3 colocalized well with this mutant in doubly transfected cells. nsp10 and its derivatives with nsp2 and nsp3 in BHK-21 cells. quantitative analysis for relocalization and colocalization relationships in cells coexpressing nsp9 or nsp10 or its derivatives with nsp2 and nsp3. HEK293 cells were cotransfected to express the indicated protein pairs. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to co-IP analysis. the map suggests that the three transmembrane proteins may serve as scaffolding proteins to recruit ORF1b-encoded core replication proteins for assembly of PRRSV RTC. nsp2, nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12 were all found at viral RTC. nsp1 and nsp1 were mainly localized in the nucleus and rarely colocalized with nsp2 in the cytoplasm. nsp2 was colocalized well with nsp9 and nsp10 in the infected cells. their interactions were also confirmed by the co-IP assay using virus-infected cell lysates. these results present a stark contrast to the poor colocalization relationship in cotransfected cells. arterivirus nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 versus coronavirus nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6), the main protease, and the core replicase proteins (arterivirus nsp9 [RdRp], nsp10 [helicase], and nsp11 [endoribonuclease] versus coronavirus nsp12 [RdR p9-nsp4 versus coronavirus nsp12-nsp5) and (v) self-interaction of RdRp. these conserved interactions highlight the evolutionary convergence on the replication strategies at the protein-protein interaction level. however, the negative results may be due to the limitations of the assays themselves and do not mean that the interaction cannot occur during infection. the truncation fragments nsp9(230\u2013685) and nsp9(431\u2013685) were colocalized with nsp2, nsp3, or nsp5. a similar scenario was found between nsp10 and its membrane-associated binding partners nsp2 and nsp12. deletion of the N-terminal domain of nsp9 or nsp10 may have caused structural perturbation at the level of possible refolding or destabilization or posttranslational modifications of the RdRp and HEL domains. the N-terminal region likely has an effect on the structure of the C-terminal domain through intramolecular interactions. p10 to interact with membrane proteins within mammalian cells may also be attributed to the \u201cincorrect\u201d membrane environment. it is known that arteriviruses induce specific membrane structures in infection (24), and coexpression of nsp2 and nsp3 is sufficient to induce similar membrane structures. nsp12 is a mysterious protein that has a predicted size of about 150 amino acids. nsp12 is an interaction hub connecting other PRRSV nsps. nsp12 is likely critical for recruiting nsp11 to RTC. y2H screening revealed 5 binding partners for nsp11. nsp12 interacts with nsp9 without regulation by viral factors. nsp11 appears to have a limited number of binding partners. PRRSV nsp4 performs as a 3C-like main protease that has multiple functions in the virus life cycle (65\u201368) it plays important roles in antagonizing host antiviral immunity and in the maturation of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (65\u201370). the Y2H screening results indicated that nsp4 could interact with nsp5, nsp9, and nsp12. but it could not be confirmed by the assays, such as colocalization analysis. onavirus nsp4, nsp4, and nsp6), the main protease (arterivirus nsp4 versus coronavirus nsp5), and the core replicase proteins (arterivirus nsp9 [RdRp], nsp10 [helicase], and nsp11 [endoribonuclease] versus coronavirus nsp12 [RdRp], nsp9 and nsp10 interacted well with nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 in co-IP assays. the full-length nsp9 interacted well with nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 in co-IP assays, but they were poorly capable of finding each other within mammalian cells. this is not due to the potential effect of the epitope tag at the C terminus co-IP assay confirms interactions with nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5. similar scenario was also found between nsp10 and its membrane-associated binding partners nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, and nsp12. truncation of nsp10 could increase interaction efficiency with nsp2. structural studies have shown that the ZBD interacts with the helicase domain (37) the regulatory domain 1B interacts with the subunits of the helicase domain to form an RNA-binding channel (37). nsp10 likely possesses a similar property, according to structure modeling. the unavailability of antibodies to do triple or quadruple staining prevents further exploration. this mechanism of interaction between nsp9 or nsp10 and PRRSV membrane proteins likely resemble that found in herpes simplex virus (HSV) nsp12 is a mysterious protein that has a predicted size of about 150 amino acids. it is arterivirus specific but poorly conserved in the primary sequences among arteriviruses. nsp12 is likely critical for recruiting nsp11 to RTC. Y2H screening revealed 5 binding partners (nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp9, and nsp12) for nsp11, but only the interaction with nsp12 was confirmed by co-IP and colocalization analyses. studies of nsp11 imply that it is critical for viral replication. transmembrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 are oriented toward the ORF1b-encoded replicase proteins. recruitment of key replicase proteins nsp9 and nsp10 to membrane proteins does not occur in a straightforward manner. this recruitment likely operates in a regulated manner to ensure orchestrated loading of RTC components. nsp4 is recruited to viral RTC as cleavage intermediates (e.g., nsp3-nsp4). nsp6 and nsp8 are predicted to be very small peptides. we do not have antibodies to nsp6. ids pGADT7, pCMV-HA-C, and pCMV-Myc were obtained from Clontech. Rabbit anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3724S) was purchased from cell signaling technology. mouse MAbs specific for PRRSV nsp1, nsp2 (E3G11), nsp4, nsp9, nsp10 (4D9), and nsp11 (3F9) the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PRRSV nsp1, nsp2, nsp7, and nsp8 were prepared in our laboratory. the nsp2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with immunogen containing the nsp2 protease domain (aa 12 to 323) nsp7 and nsp8 were expressed as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli BL21 cells nsps were cloned into vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 to generate bait and prey plasmids. the autoactivation and toxicity of bait fusion vectors were tested in the Y2H gold yeast strain (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) the proteins were tagged with epitope tags (e.g., HA and FLAG) at the N or C terminus. the plasmid pSrc-nsp9-HA encodes the full-length nsp9 with an HA tag at its C terminus. the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times (5 min for each wash), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100\u20132% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min. the cells were then incubated with the proper primary antibodies for 1 h in a humid chamber (RT) and then washed with PBS three times sp1 MAb (1:1,000), nsp2 MAb (1:3,000), nsp4 MAb (1:1,000), nsp7 PAb (1:2,000), nsp9 MAb (1:2,000), nsp10 MAb (1:2,000), nsp11 MAb (1:1,000), nsp12 MAb (1:1,000), and mouse anti-dsRNA (1:200; SCICONS) all the secondary antibodies were used at a d anti-FLAG PAb (F7425; Sigma), mouse anti-HA MAb (H3663; Sigma) or mouse MAbs to PRRSV nsp2 or nsp9 in conjunction with protein A/G beads (SC-2003; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4\u00b0C with rotation. proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. rabbit secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. the nsp9 and nsp10 structures were referred to poliovirus precursor protein 3CD (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 2IJD) and EAV nsp10 (PDB ID 4N0N) mouse anti-HA MAb (H3663) and rabbit anti-Myc PAb (C3956) all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse PAb and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit PAb were purchased from ZSGB-Bio (Beijing, China) nsp2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with immunogen containing the nsp2 protease domain (aa 12 to 323). nsp7 and nsp8 were expressed as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli BL21 cells. the purified recombinant GST-nsp7 and GST-nsp8 were used as immunogens. plasmids were cotransformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain. positive colonies were reselected on high-stringency quadruple-dropout plates. pGBKT7-53 and pGADT7-T were positive controls. plasmid pSrc-nsp9-HA encodes full-length nsp9 with an HA tag at its C terminus. pSrc-nsp9-HA encodes the full-length nsp9 with an HA tag at its C terminus. all PRRSV genes in the created plasmids are under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. the cells were then incubated with the proper primary antibodies for 1 h in a humid chamber (RT) and then washed with PBS three times (5 min for each wash) nuclear DNA was stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) HEK293 cells were grown on 6-well plates at a confluence of 70%. cells were lysed using NP-40 buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM EDTA) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation. the total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. after being washed six times (5 min for each wash) membrane-bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents.
