{"summary": "type A Clostridium perfringens with other microbial pathogens have been associated with diarrhea in suckling piglets. disease is typically seen in piglets within 48 h of birth and is associated with creamy or pasty feces lasting several days. some studies have reported an association between the presence of the consensus cpb2 gene and type A-associated diarrheal illness of neonatal piglets compared with healthy controls (10\u201313) the presence of cpb gene in isolates from piglets with type C C. perfringens infection was a confounding variable. in total, 46 piglets were selected (36 with diarrhea and 12 without diarrhea) 44 piglets were aged 1 to 4 d and 4 pigs were aged between 6 to 13 d. samples from small intestine and colon were stored at 70\u00b0C. the ELISA for C. difficile toxins A and B, and rotavirus A latex agglutination (RLA) testing were carried out on colonic content. the presence of intestinal coccidia was evaluated histologically. 3 new primers were designed for atypical cpb2, netB, and tpeL. control isolates with known toxin genotype profiles were treated exactly the same way as the untested bacterial isolates in the lysis and PCR stages. cpa AAGAACTAGTAGCTTACATATCAACTAGTGGTG (54\u00b0C) 124 TTTCCTGGGTTGTCCATTTCC (51\u00b0C) TEX-TTGGAATCAAAAAGGATGGAAAAACTCAAG-BHQ2 (55\u00b0C) cpb TGGAGAGCTAGCCTGGAATAGA (52\u00b0C) FAM-CTTAATTGGAATGGTGTGCTAGGACAA-BHQ1 ( ELISA plates were coated with 100 L per well of capture antibody. plates were washed twice using washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% fish skin gelatin) and once using PBS, pH 7.4, followed by blocking with the blocking buffer. incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by 5 washings on ice using cold washing buffer. the detecting antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-CPB2 antibody, labeled with horseradish peroxidise, mAb-HRP) was applied (100 L per well) an hour after addition of the chromogenic substrate (100 L per well, incubation at room temperature), the reaction was stopped. feces and 1 to 2 healthy, non-diarrheic, piglets from a different litter were selected. 46 piglets were selected (36 with diarrhea and 12 without diarrhea) 44 piglets were aged 1 to 4 d and 4 pigs were aged between 6 to 13 d. key\u2019s agar and E. coli isolates were serotyped using polyvalent \u2018O,K\u2019 antiserum pool to detect the most common serotypes of enterotoxigenic E. coli. the ELISA for C. difficile toxins A and B, and rotavirus A latex agglutination (RLA) testing were carried out on colonic content. 3 new primers were designed for atypical cpb2, netB, and tpeL. control isolates with known toxin genotype profiles were treated exactly the same way as the untested bacterial isolates in the lysis and PCR stages. cpa AAGAACTAGTAGCTTACATATCAACTAGTGGTG (54\u00b0C) 124 TTTCCTGGGTTGTCCATTTCC (51\u00b0C) TEX-TTGGAATCAAAAAGGATGGAAAAACTCAAG-BHQ2 (55\u00b0C) cpb TGGAGAGCTAGCCTGGAATAGA (52\u00b0C) FAM-CTTAATTGGAATGGTGTGCTAGGACAA-BHQ1 ( TAATATATCTGTTGAAGG (53\u00b0C) 168 ACCGTCCTTAGTCTCAAC (51\u00b0C) CalFluor Orange 560-ACTGCTGGTGTGCTGGAATAAATGCTTCA-BHQ1 (56\u00b0C) tpeL GGAATTGGCACTA (49\u00b0C) FAM-TGACAGCAGCTATTAGTTCTCT-BHQ1 (51\u00b0C) ELISA plates were coated with 100 L per well of incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by 5 washings on ice using cold washing buffer. the plate was then incubated 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with the washing buffer. an hour after addition of the chromogenic substrate, the reaction was stopped. s was not isolated from 2 out of 24 (8.3%) and 11 out of 72 (15.1%) of intestinal samples. it was present in either the jejunum or colon contents of all 48 piglets. larger numbers of C. perfringens were isolated from the colon than from the jejunum.

Clostridium difficile toxins were detected in 7 scouring piglets and enterotoxigenic E. coli were detected in 2 of these. rotavirus was also detected in 7 piglets with histopathological changes suggesting rotaviral infection. the presence of large numbers of cpb2-positive type A C. perfringens in the intestine of neonatal piglets should be considered as normal commensals."}
