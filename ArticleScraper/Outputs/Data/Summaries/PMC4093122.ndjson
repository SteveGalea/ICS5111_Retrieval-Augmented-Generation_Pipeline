{"summary": "fats containing one double bond are monounstaturated and those with more than one double bond are polyunsaturated. thereamong, Arachidonic acid (AA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid play a key role in growth and development of an organism. study of fat1 gene is becoming an important topic in transgene research. it is becoming clear that fat1 transgenic cattle with higher levels of n-3 PUFAs are becoming more urgent than ever. many attempts to express fat1 in a transgenic background do not work well. restriction enzyme digestion sites AatII, XhoI, SmaI and XbaI to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the sequence. the effective number of codons (Frank Wright Nc value) could help to judge the number of codon types. codon optimization fat1 was double digested with XhoI 0.75 l, Sma I 0.75 l, T buffer 2 l, fat1 4 l, Nuclease-free water 2.5 l, 37\u00b0C 5 h. fat1 gene is driven by the EF1 promoter, followed by IRES and eGFP, containing the neo gene. all adherent cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin and seeded in 6-well plates with a density of 2105 per well. cells were cultured in selection DMEM containing 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 g/ml of G418 antibiotic. the best G418 screening concentration was after 10 to 14 d the cells survival rate was 0% after adding G418, the lowest concentration of G418. transfection complexes were then added to each well and the plate was rocked back and forth gently. cells were propagated and split into selection DMEM containing 10% FBS. the surviving cells were picked and propagated in a new plate until stable cell line formation. the conditions used for real-time quantitative PCR were 2 min at 95\u00b0C and then 35 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 40 s at 60\u00b0C. the pEF-GFP vector group and untransfection groups were negative controls. polyclone was mixed to eliminate the effects of the inserted gene integration site. methyl esters were analyzed by gas chromatography using a fully automated HP5890 system (Agilent) equipped with a flame-ionization detector. Oven 140\u00b0C for 5 min, 10\u00b0C/min to 220\u00b0C. high level gene expression has a low Nc value, by contrast, a high Nc value means a low level of expression efficiency. pEF-GFP-fat1 vector contains codon optimization fat1 cDNA driven by the EF1 promoter. enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was used for transient expression in cells regulated by IRES sequence. T4 DNA Ligase Buffer 2.5 l, pEF-GFP vector 2.5 l, fat1 5 l, T4 DNA Ligase 5 U, PEG 4000 Solution 2 l, Nuclease-free water 12 l and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA, Pasching, the best G418 screening concentration was after 10 to 14 d the cells survival rate was 0% after adding G418, the lowest concentration of G418. cells were transfected using lipofectamine2000TM reagent (invitrogen, CA, USA) qPCR was performed in a 25 l reaction system with 35 cycles: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 66\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 60 s. pEF-GFP vector group and untransfection groups were negative controls. polyclone was mixed in order to eliminate the effects of the inserted gene integration site. the cell pellet was collected in a glass methylation tube, mixed with 4.0 ml MeOH and 2.0 ml trichlormethane. the mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 g/min for 30 min then cooled to 16\u00b0C, removed the upper layer and dried under nitrogen. the pEF-GFP-fat1 vector was identified by restriction enzyme digestion. the multicloning sites of AatII/XbaI were synthesized into the fat1 gene. the vector was transformed and amplified in E. coli (TOP10; Tiangen, China) according to the conventional method and extracted using AxyPrep Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China) the plasmids were sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (China), contrasted fat1 sequence by DNAStar and BLAST. the best G418 selected screening concentration was 500 g/ml. the best G418 screening concentration was 500 g/ml. the best G418 selected screening concentration was 500 g/ml. pEF-GFP-fat1 transfection group showed a 1,234 bp fragment. pEF-GFP-fat1 transfection group showed a 1,234 bp fragment. qPCR indicated that the relative expression level was 35,273.37 nM. EPA (20:5 n-3), DHA (22:6 n-3) and DPA (22:5 n-3) increased from 9.26%, 14.19% and 14.39% up to 11.26%, 19.07% and 17.76% respectively. PUFAs composition of total lipids from the transgenic cell and the controls Fatty acids Transgenic cells pEF-GFP vector control Untransfection control n-6 PUFAs. the change accounted for 5.38% of all the fat1 gene bases. the G+C content increased from 45.08% to 50.04% and were distributed uniformly. the result showed that there was a decreasing of Frank Wright Nc value after optimization. the results of the digestion and sequencing showed that the vector construction was successful. the picture shows that fat1 gene was double digested by restrictive enzyme XhoI. the picture shows that fat1 gene was double digested by restrictive enzyme. the pEF-GFP-fat1 transfection group showed a 1,234 bp fragment. the pEF-GFP-fat1 transfection group showed a 1,234 bp fragment. the pEF-GFP-fat1 transfection group showed a 1,234 bp fragment. the cell cycle change was analyzed using the Propidium Iodide approach. the results showed that there was not a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment performance. the nucleus of positive cells could meet the donor condition. PUFAs composition of total lipids from the transgenic cell and controls Fatty acids Transgenic cells pEF-GFP vector control Untransfection control n-6 PUFAs 18:2 n-6 1.72 2.62 2.33 20:4 n-6 2.19 5.23 3.81 22:4 n-6 0 0 0 Total n-6 3.91 7.84 6.14 n-3 PUFAs 18:3 n-3 0 0 20:5 n-3 0.85 both transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and transgenic oil-synthesizing seeds express n-3 PUFAs. but mammals themselves cannot synthesis n-3 PUFAs directly, they must obtain them by ingestion from their daily ration. most of the long-chain n-3 PUFAs are found in deep-sea fishes. e. elegans shows codon characteristics that are similar to prokaryotes. n-6 PUFAs were catalyzed to n-3 PUFAs with high catalysis efficiency. transgenic fat1 catalysis efficiency can lay the first stone in terms of high expression n-3 PUFAs in transgenic cattle. the results of this study have provided a good prospect for the use of transgenic technology to produce the special fish oil n-3 PUFAs."}
