Fig. 1 shows that IFN-3 could significantly increase the expression of these 3 ISGs in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-3 significantly inhibited preS1 and pgRNA expression at doses equal to or greater than 10 ng/ml (A and B) the increasing doses of IFN-3 significantly promoted cell death only at the highest two doses. ng/ml of IFN-3 showed the ability to significantly inhibit HBV replication with minimal cytotoxicity on HepG2.2.15 cells. the doses were less than 1,000 ng/ml. these experiments were performed in triplicate. a list of significantly upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) proteins with |log2(IFN-3/Control)| ratios of greater than 1. the effects of IFN-2a would be secondary, for the sake of comparison with IFN-3 effects.

CALR, a player in this process, was down-regulated. qPCR work confirmed significant up-regulation of these IFNs. it is likely that the increase in IFN expression because of RIG-I up-regulation could lead to more production of IFNs at the protein level and in turn activate IFN receptors as positive feedback. cyclophilin D (PPIF) was the most up-regulated protein in our study on IFN-3 treatment. RNA-binding proteins, particularly spliceosome components, were both up- and down-regulated on IFN-3 treatment versus control. a simple comparison between IFN-3 versus IFN-2a could lead to errors in interpretation. for example, the observation that IFN-3 results in up-regulation or down-regulation of a protein versus IFN-2a renders an uninteresting result if IFN-3 does not have any significant effect. this scenario can be seen in outcomes #3 and #25 in Fig. 12. we did not identify proteins clearly related to antiviral processes in these two outcome groups. this reason pointed to broader unbiased analysis. the resulting enrichment groups were subjected to 2-D cluster analysis. the results could help point toward differential effects of IFN-3 versus IFN-2a. the results could help point toward differential effects of IFN-3 versus IFN-2a. the response to type III IFN treatment in HepG2.2.15 cells has not been reported. we performed qPCR to investigate the expression of the classical ISGs in HepG2.2.15 cells treated with various amounts of IFN-3 for 24h. qPCR was performed on HepG2.2.15 RNA following treatment with various amounts of IFN-3 for 24 h. copy numbers of virus in IFN3-treated HepG2.2.15 cells were diminished in a dose-dependent manner relative to control. the increasing doses of IFN-3 significantly promoted cell death only at the highest two doses in this experiment. the viable HepG2.2.15 cells reduced to 94% and 84% in 100 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml conditions. so, we settled on 100 ng/ml of IFN-3 for further experiments. seven hundred thirty-seven proteins showed significant changes in abundance. a slight bias toward down-regulated proteins in response to IFN-3 stimulation. we should point out that our primary intention in this work is to explore IFN-3 effects on HepG2.2.15 cells. antiviral defense Q15646 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein OASL 2.58 RLR signaling pathway O95786 Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX58 DDX58 2.47 RLR signaling pathway Q9Y6K5 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase 3 OAS3 2.42 Antiviral defense (Degrade viral RNA) Q29960 HLA class I histo cell adhesion Q9H0P0 Cytosolic 5\u2032-nucleotidase 3A NT5C3A 1.38 Antiviral defense (Inhibit reverse transcription) P35527 Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 9 KRT9 1.34 Intermediate filament organization P41226 Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 7 UBA7 1.32 Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 7 UBA7 1.32 Ubiquitin kinase substrate 8 EPS8 1.57 Actin polymerization-dependent cell motility Q9NZD2 Glycolipid transfer protein GLTP -1.62 Intermembrane lipid transfer Q13126 Isoform 2 of S-methyl-5\u2032-thioadenosine phosphorylase MTAP 1.76 Putative heat shock protein HSP 90-beta-3 HSP90AB3P 3.58 Protein folding and response to stress All HBV proteins were identified proteins of interest were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey system. expression of OAS3, SAMHD1 and STAT1 increased after IFN-3 treatment. no clear pattern emerged when down-regulated proteins were examined. elongation, translation, prefoldin mediated transfer of substrate to CCT/TriC, unfolded protein response, interleukin-23 signaling, and hypusine synthesis from eIF5A-lysine. we conducted a protein-by-protein search for relevance to the viral processes. unless otherwise stated, we found no proteins that contradict the patterns that we report below. several molecules involved in microtubule assembly and function evinced decreased expression after IFN-3 treatment. all identified proteins known to play roles herein were found to decrease because of IFN-3 stimulation. was up-regulated and has been shown to interfere with the interaction between pgRNA and HBV polymerase, required for encapsidation. proteins that might interfere with viral assembly were not identified in this study. two up-regulated proteins thought to play a role in inhibiting HBV export were detected after IFN-3 stimulation. proteins involved in transport of peptides from the cytosol to the ER and assembly of peptide-HLA class I complexes did not reach statistical significance. other proteins involved in the above step did not reach statistical significance but tended to increase expression following IFN-3 treatment. CALR, a player in this process, was down-regulated. qPCR work confirms significant up-regulation of type I and III IFNs. increase in IFN expression because of RIG-I up-regulation could lead to more production of IFNs at the protein level. three 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ, YWHAH, and SFN) were found to be down-regulated following IFN-3 treatment. another down-regulated protein of interest was cyclophilin D (PPIF) a tree depicts all 27 possible differential expression outcomes. a simple comparison between IFN-3 versus IFN-2a could lead to errors in interpretation. a simple comparison between IFN-3 versus IFN-2a could lead to errors in interpretation. we did not identify proteins clearly related to antiviral processes in these two outcome groups. a priori, one would expect the most interesting outcomes to be found in cases in which IFN-2a and IFN-3 have clearly opposite effects. the final enrichment term was only associated with a single case, that of proteins down-regulated in all treatment pairs. the results could help point toward differential effects of IFN-3 versus IFN-2a. the response to type III IFN treatment in HepG2.2.15 cells has not been reported. the response to type III IFN treatment in HepG2.2.15 cells has not been reported. qPCR was performed on HepG2.2.15 RNA following treatment with various amounts of IFN-3 for 24 h. IFN-3 reduced both preS1 and pgRNA expression compared with control in a dose-dependent manner. the toxicity of this drug was considered before we investigated the cellular response to IFN-3. the increasing doses of IFN-3 significantly promoted cell death only at the highest two doses in this experiment. the viability of HepG2.2.15 cells after IFN-3 treatment was determined by MTT assay. 2904 proteins identified based on a single peptide. seven hundred thirty-seven proteins showed significant changes in abundance. effects of IFN-2a would be secondary, for the sake of comparison with IFN-3 effects. antiviral defense (Inhibit viral protein synthesis) Q96AZ6 Interferon-stimulated gene 20 kDa protein ISG20 3.28 Antiviral defense (Degrade viral RNA) P05161 Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 ISG15 3.27 Antiviral defense Q15646 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein OASL 2.58 RLR signaling pathway O95786 Probable ATP-dependent processing and presentation Q10589 Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 BST2 1.55 Antiviral defense (Inhibit viral egress) Q6IA86 Isoform 6 of Elongator complex protein 2 ELP2 1.46 Regulation of transcription Q08380 Galectin-3-binding protein LGALS3BP 1.39 Cell adhesion Q9H0P0 Cytosolic 5\u2032-nucleotidase 3A NT5C3A 1.38 Anti all HBV proteins, except HBV pol and HBx, are secreted (30\u201332), likely causing intracellular levels of these proteins to be scarce. this finding is in agreement with a previous study that specifically examined intracellular HBV proteins in HepG2.2.15 cells but found them to be undetectable (29). protein 1 (SAMHD1) (34\u201336) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (37, 38) were selected for validation by Western blot analysis. the proteins of interest were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey system. antiviral proteins and host cellular factors of interest identified in this study were mapped into the HBV-life cycle. unless otherwise stated, we found no proteins that contradict the patterns that we report below. cytosolic-to-nuclear transport of the HBV capsid along microtubules decreased expression after IFN-3 treatment. all identified proteins known to play roles herein were found to decrease because of IFN-3 stimulation. antiviral proteins (EIF2AK2, IFIT1, and IFIT2) involved in protein synthesis increased in treated cells. initiation factors (EIF1AY, EIF2S3, EIF2B1, EIF3B, EIF4G1, EIF4B, EIF4G2, and EIF5A) decreased in this study. initiation factors (EIF1AY, EIF2S3, EIF2B1, EIF3B, EIF4G1, and EIF5A) decreased in this study. both cap components (PSME1 and PSME2) associated with the immunoproteasome were up-regulated, whereas all significantly altered cap components of the constitutive proteasome were down-regulated. a cytosol aminopeptidase, LAP3, was also up-regulated. the innate immune response against HBV is the sensing of viral RNA, leading to IFN activation, which includes components such as toll-like receptors, RIG-I, and MDA5. increased levels of type I and III IFNs, which are activated by RIG-I, were also significantly up-regulated. three 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ, YWHAH, and SFN) were found to be down-regulated following IFN-3 treatment. another down-regulated protein of interest was cyclophilin D (PPIF) a simple comparison between IFN-3 versus IFN-2a could lead to errors in interpretation. a simple comparison between IFN-3 versus IFN-2a could lead to errors in interpretation. FN-3 treatment caused up-regulation of proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation (SYVN1, LAP3, PSMA7, and PSMB7) whereas IFN-2a did not produce significant effects. a priori, one would expect the most interesting outcomes to be found in cases in which IFN-2a and IFN-3 have clearly opposite effects. specific terms related to \"translation\" and \"metabolism of RNA\" were significantly associated with 13 out of 17 different outcome groups. the final enrichment term was only associated with a single case, that of proteins down-regulated in all treatment pairs. Reactome enrichment analysis was performed on the tree outcomes that contained at least 9 members, excluding outcome #14 in which no significant alterations were seen on any treatment. the result is displayed as a heatmap. all 3 ISGs were significantly elevated by IFN-3 treatment (p 0.001) at all doses compared with a control (PBS) qPCR was performed on HepG2.2.15 RNA following treatment with various amounts of IFN-3 for 24 h. IFN-3 significantly suppressed viral propagation at doses equal to or greater than 100 ng/ml (A and B) these experiments were performed in triplicate. the toxicity of this drug was considered. 15 cells were lysed and digested with trypsin. the tryptic peptides were labeled with light, medium, and heavy dimethyl reagents. they were then fractionated for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. list of significantly upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) proteins with |log2 ratios of greater than 1.

Upon IFN-3 treatment, we found several biological processes expected to be canonically regulated on general IFN stimulation. however, several biological processes not previously emphasized upon interferon stimulation emerged from this work. proteins in red and green text represent up- and down-regulated proteins. proteins in red and green text represent up- and down-regulated proteins. antiviral proteins (EIF2AK2, IFIT1, and IFIT2) involved in protein synthesis increased in treated cells. almost all identified translation initiation factors (EIF1AY, EIF2S3, EIF2B1, EIF3B, EIF4G1, EIF4B, EIF4G2, and EIF5A) decreased. all deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) identified in this study decreased because of IFN-3 treatment. upstream of these processes, core proteasome components, PSMA7, PSMB7, and PSMG2 were up-regulated with no exception. several effector molecules involved in peptide loading on class I HLA were up-regulated. the italic red text represents proteins with increased expression levels that failed to reach statistical significance. qPCR work confirmed significant up-regulation of these IFNs. IFN-3 up-regulated the expression of RIG-I and IFIT3. IFN-3 also elevated the expression of OASL and TRIM25. these proteins promote type I and type III IFN production. the same pattern applies to proteins shown to bind to the splicing factor U2AF2 (log p = 5 and 13, respectively) the same pattern applies to proteins shown to bind to the splicing factor U2AF2 (log p = 6 and 9, respectively) the same pattern applies to proteins shown to bind to the splicing factor U2AF2 (58). IFITM3 was significantly up-regulated upon treatment with both IFNs. but this effect was significantly stronger upon IFN-3 treatment. outcome #24 where IFN-3 caused down-regulation whereas IFN-2a did not produce significant effects. in most cases where proteins were up-regulated upon IFN-2a treatment, \u201cinterferon signaling\u201d and/or \u201cclass I MHC mediated antigen processing & presentation\u201d terms were apparent. specific terms related to \u201ctranslation\u201d and \u201cmetabolism of RNA\u201d were significantly associated with 13 out of 17 different outcome groups. the number in parentheses refers to the number of identified proteins in the group. the proteins in each group that might be involved in suppressing HBV replication are shown in colored boxes specifying various processes, particularly antiviral. only two studies have focused on the effects of IFN- treatment of HBV-transfected cells. a comparison against a type I IFN showed that IFN- showed greater potency in viral elimination at the 6 h time point, but potency was equivalent at 24 h. the effects of IFN- treatment have not been studied with high-resolution mass spectrometry to date. the 3/c list significantly overlapped (p value = 1013) transcripts whose up/down-regulation patterns mirror those of RIG-I transcripts reported in the ARCHS4 resource. the /c list gave p value = 1018, perhaps illustrating the expected difference in potency. a small molecule-based inhibition of proteasome activity could restrain the anti-HBV activity of type I IFN in vitro. the immunoproteasome is distinct from the constitutive proteasome in the composition of its catalytic subunits. IFN treatment has not previously been shown to up-regulate RIG-I pathway components in HBV infected cells. we found that treating HepG2.2.15 with IFN-3 increased the expression of RIG-I. we observed elevated expression of RIG-G, known to enhance the activity of RIG-I. HBx protein interacts with 14-3-3 proteins resulting in enhancement of Raf-1 kinase activity together with control of hepatocyte growth (80). the down-regulation of cyclophilin D upon IFN-3 treatment suggests that this molecule may play a role in inhibition of HBV replication. ER calcium-binding chaperone involved in regulation of calcium homoeostasis. inhibition of IRF-7 translocation into the nucleus was induced by CALR. this group showed that CALR inhibited JAK-STAT pathway induction by IFN- by inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation, diminishing expression of PKR and OAS. 9 knockout and treatment with a specific CDC42 inhibitor in HBx-Huh7 cells (92) reduced cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in these cells. despite the division of treatment outcomes into 27 non-intersecting protein groups, unbiased Reactome enrichment analysis repeatedly elicit an RNA-metabolism/translation theme. 4.7, 3.2, 4.8, 8.2, and 5.3 are seen only once out of six outcomes where IFN-2a treatment results in significantly more abundant protein expression. this result could imply differential regulation of these ER targeting proteins versus IFN-2a treatment. IFITM3 strongly up-regulated in our own 3/2a comparison (outcome #1), was the single most significantly up-regulated transcript in the 3/2 comparison (p value = 1010) we should reiterate the points that our experimental design did not allow for discrimination of kinetic effects. we reported significant up-regulation of immunoproteasome components, restoration of HBV-inhibited RIG-I pathway proteins, and several proteins not previously associated with IFN-3 treatment. the altered proteins might be new therapeutic targets in CHB infection."}
