{"summary": "etiological agent identified as a then novel coronavirus known as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) within a short span of time from December 2002 to July 2003, the newly emerged virus spread quickly to infect more than 8000 people across 25 countries. small animals such as palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procynonoides) are believed to be the a virus from the genus betacoronavirus (lineage B), family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. it is encoding for 16 non-structural proteins, 8 accessory proteins and 4 structural proteins. every surface spike of the SARS-CoV is composed of a trimer of S protein of 1255 amino acids in length. anti-S2 mAbs have broad neutralizing characteristics against a wider range of SARS-CoV variants, including human and zoonotic SARS-CoV strains. a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the HR2 domain and the region upstream of HR2 of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro. mAb 1A9 has broad cross-neutralizing activity and identified a single amino acid (aspartic acid) at position 1128 in S to be crucial for the interaction with mAb 1A9. the mutant exerts no effects on the expression of S on the cell surface. the escape virus retains the same viral entry property as the wild-type virus. cells and virus Vero E6 (American Type Culture Collection) and 293 FT cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), nonessential amino acids (Gibco) and penicillin (10 mg/ml)-streptomycin (10,000 units/ml)-streptomycin (sigma Aldrich) the concentration of the purified monoclonal antibodies in each tube was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific) the concentration of the purified monoclonal antibodies in each tube was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific) the generation of escape mutants was performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. five plaques were picked using a pasteur pipette, freeze-thawed once and further amplified in vero E6 cells. neutralization tests were then performed on all the virus clones to confirm that they could escape neutralization by mAb 1A9. the arginine residue at position 344 was substituted with lysine (K); serine (S) residue at position 360 was substituted with phenylalanine (F); lysine at position 479 was substituted with asparagines. lysine at position 479 was substituted with phenylalanine (F); serine at position 487 was substituted with threonine (T) the cells were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection by scrapping. cells were spun down by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS twice. cell were then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subjected expression and purification of S fragments in bacteria A fragment of S(1030-1188 aa) was expressed as a GST (glutathione-transferase) fusion protein using the pGEX6p1 vector (GE healthcare) the wild-type and mutant (N1056K and D1128A) S fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3. purified wild-type and mutant (N1056K and D1128A) GST-S(1030\u20131188 aa) proteins were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4\u00b0C at 100 ng/well. wells were blocked in 5% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. primary antibodies (mAb 1A9 and mouse anti-GST antibody [Santa Cruz]) luciferase reporter gene used in replacement of live SARS-CoVs. pNL43-R-E-Luc and plasmids expressing S genes were co-transfected in 293 FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) all experiments were carried out in triplicates. difference in viral entry between wild-type and mutant S-pp was measured using unpaired t-test. cell dissociation solution (Sigma) washed twice in 1x PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 3 hours at 4\u00b0C on a nutator. cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) secondary antibody. ACE2, known as CHO-ACE2, was established previously [31] and cultured in the same medium. all cell lines were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. serial dilutions of SARS-CoV ranging from 101 to 108 were incubated in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml of mAb 1A9 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the virus-mAb mixtures were then incubated with Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the cells were further incubated for 2 days in the presence of mAb 1 TOPO cloning and sequencing Viral RNA of the 5 escape virus clones was isolated using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) the cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers targeting the S gene to generate a long fragment (amino acids 1 to 1003) and a short fragment (amino acids 969 to 1255) these gene fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen pXJ3\u2032-S-N1056K, pXJ3\u2032-S-D1128A, pXJ3\u2032-S-D1128A/N1056K, pXJ3\u2032-S-D1128E and pXJ3\u2032-S-D1128N plasmids were synthesized and cloned into the same expression vector by using the same restriction sites. cells were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection by proteins were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with primary antibodies, mAbs 1A9 and 7G12 [31] overnight at 4 the wild-type and mutant (N1056K and D1128A) S fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3. cells were cooled to 16\u00b0C and induced with isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. anti-GST antibody was added as primary antibodies at 4-fold dilutions. the wells were then washed in PBST followed by the addition of goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Pierce) as secondary antibody. reaction was stopped using 0.2 M sulphuric acid. CHO-ACE2 cells were grown in 500 ul of growing media per well for 24 hours before each experiment. mAb-virus mixtures or virus alone were used to infect CHO-ACE2 cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. primary antibodies were added as primary antibodies at 4-fold dilutions. the wells were then washed in PBST followed by the addition of goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Pierce) as secondary antibody. reaction was stopped using 0.2 M sulphuric acid. cells were washed again 3 times and immediately used for FACS analysis using the CyAn flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) mAb 1A9 belonging to Type II was the most effective in cell-cell membrane blocking and bound to residues 1111-1130 which are immediately upstream of the HR2 domain. mAb 1A9 was found to be able to bind to the S2 subunits of the civet SARS-CoV SZ3 and bat SL-CoV Rp3 and Rf1 strains. antibody targeting the S1 domain of the human SARS-CoV S protein, mAb 7G12 [31] was used to determine the relative expressions of the chimeric S proteins. mAb 1A9 was used as a control antibody to detect protein expression. cells were pre-incubated with different concentrations of mAb 1A9 at 100, 150 and 200 g/ml for 1 hour before infecting CHO-ACE2 cells. cells were harvested 48 hours post-infection and luciferase activities were measured. the mAb 1A9 neutralization assay showed that mAb 1A9 was able to neutralize the S-pp expressing chimeric S of civet SARS-CoV SZ3 and bat SL-CoV Rp3 and Rf1 strains. the results obtained from the mAb 1A9 neutralization assay showed that mAb 1A9 has broad neutralizing capability. mutant clones were resistant to neutralization by mAb 1A9. mutant clones were also sensitive to neutralization by another mAb 1G10. mutant clones were also sensitive to neutralization by another mAb 1G10. 2 out of 5 clones had D1128A mutation and 3 out of 5 clones had N1056K mutation. none of the clones had both mutations. mAb 1A9 and mAb 1G10 were used to infect vero E6 cells. S-D1128A showed a reduced binding to mAb 1A9 compared to the wild-type S protein (S-WT), while S protein with the N1056K mutation (S-N1056K) did not show a reduction in mAb 1A9 binding compared to native forms of S. similar results were also observed in ELISA using wild-type and mutant D1128A and N1056K GST-S(1030-1188) fragments expressed from bacteria cells cell lysates containing S-WT, S-D1128A, S-N1056K or S-D1128A/N1056K were subjected to immunoprecipitation using mAb 1A9 or 7G12 and protein A beads. the rabbit anti-S1 antibody binds to amino acids 48\u2013358 of the S1 subunit. mAb 1A9 prevented the viral entry of wild-type S-pp and S-N1056K-pp in CHO-ACE2 cells by 36% and 35% respectively. at lower concentrations of mAb 1A9 (25, 50 and 100 g/ml), similar results were obtained, suggesting that S-D1128-pp was resistant to mAb 1A9 neutralization. mutants containing wild-type (S-WT-pp) or mutant S were pre-incubated with different concentrations of (A) mAb 1A9 or (B) mAb 1G10 at 25, 50, 100 and 200 g/ml for 1 hour before infecting CHO-ACE2 cells. an anti-S1, non-neutralizing mAb 7G12 was used as control antibody at 200 g/ml. fected, wild-type S-transfected and mutant D1128A S-transfected cells were incubated with mAb 7G12 followed by an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. a positive shift in fluorescence was observed in the wild-type S-expressing cells when compared to the vector-transfected cells. mAb 7G12 was used as a control antibody to ensure equal amounts of S-pp were coated onto each well. it was observed that there was no significant difference in the expression of wild-type and mutant D1128A S protein in the S-pps. this indicates that the mutation did not cause any change in the efficiency of S protein incorporation into viral particles. residues 1111-1130 is a highly conserved region within the S2 subunit of human, civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains. it has been demonstrated that the bat SL-CoV Rp3 uses a different unknown receptor for entry and thus, could not infect cells expressing human ACE2 receptor. mAb 1A9 was found to be able to bind to the S2 subunits of the civet SARS- the civet SARS-CoV SZ3 chimeric S contains four mutations (R344K, S360F, K479N and S485T) at its RBD that is different from the RBD of human SARS-CoV HKU39849. the bat SL-CoVs Rp3 and Rf1 chimeric S proteins had their entire RBD replaced by the RBD of human SARS-CoV HKU39849 (amino acids mAb 1A9 has been successfully used in the study of highly pathogenic viruses including the influenza virus [33] and sARS-CoV [34], [35], [36]. mAb 1A9 was able to infect and enter CHO-ACE2 cells in the absence or presence of different concentrations of mAb 1A9. mAb 1A9 has broad neutralizing capability. tralize the S-pp expressing chimeric S of civet SARS-CoV SZ3 and bat SL-CoV Rp3 and Rf1. mAb 1A9 escape mutants were generated. all 5 escape mutant clones were resistant to neutralization by mAb 1A9. 100% CPE was observed in escape mutant cells even in the presence of 2 mg/ml of mAb 1A9. both the wild-type and mutant virus were equally sensitive to neutralization by another mAb 1G10. mAb 1G10 was used at concentrations 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/ml. mAb 1G10 was used at concentrations 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml. difference in mAb 1A9 binding to wild-type and mutant S proteins Wild-type S, substitution S mutants. residue 1128 is important in the binding of mAb 1A9 to the S protein. residue 1128 is important in the binding of mAb 1A9 to the S protein. no significant synergistic effect was observed. mutant clones mAb 1A9 are mutants identified in escape mutant clones generated against mAb 1A9. mutant clones expressing wild-type, mutant D1128A, mutant N1056K and mutant D1128A/N1056K S proteins were generated. mAb 1A9 prevented the viral entry of wild-type S-pp and S-D1128A-pp in CHO-ACE2 cells by 36% and 35% respectively. mAb 1A9 is sufficient to mediate the escape from neutralization by mAb 1A9. S-D1128A/N1056K-pp was also resistant to mAb 1A9 neutralization. no synergistic effects were observed between the mutations. luciferase activity measured in relative light units was expressed as a percentage of the reading obtained in the absence of antibody. bars represent SD of the experiment carried out in triplicates. effects of D1128A mutation on the expression of S protein on cell surface and incorporation of S protein into S-pp Mutations can have profound effects on the synthesis and maturation process of the S protein. FACS analysis was performed with 293 FT cells were transfected with empty vector (full line) or with plasmids expressing full length wild-type S (dotted line) or full length mutant D1128A S (dash line) cells were harvested 72 hours post-transfection and stained with mouse mAb 7G12. results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. anti-HIV-1 P24 mAb was used instead of mAb 7G12. OD450 nm readings obtained were similar, confirming that equal amounts of S-pp viruses were successfully coated on the ELISA plate. development of anti-SARS-CoV treatments and vaccines remains crucial. the epitopes of these mAbs are found to be located at the S2 subunit upstream of HR1 (residues 787\u2013809, 791\u2013805) [47], [48], within the loop region in between HR1 and HR2 (residues 1023\u20131189) [31], [40] and within the HR2 domain (residues 1151\u20131192) [31], [40] and within the HR2 domain (res the IC50 value of mAb 1A9 is between 25\u201350 g/ml, indicating the lower potency of mAb 1A9. this can possibly be attributed to the inaccessibility of the S2 subunit. however, SARS-CoV is capable of attaining mutations in the RBD region without affecting viral infectivity [54], leading to escape in mAb neutralization. mutant mAb 1A9 binds to a novel epitope located in between HR1 and HR2. mutant mAb 1A9 is similar to wild-type S in these aspects. a substitution to alanine in the escape virus is sufficient to abolish neutralization by mAb 1A9. the binding of mAb 1A9 to the D1128 residue in the loop region causes steric hindrance that prevents the association of HR1 and HR2 to form the six-helical fusion bundle core. structural analysis of the interaction between mAb 1A9 and S is actively being pursued in order to define the inhibition mechanism. cells were harvested 48 hours post-infection and luciferase activities were measured. bars represent SD of the experiment carried out in triplicates. anti-S1, non-neutralizing mAb 7G12 was used as control antibody at 200 g/ml. 293 FT cells were transfected with no plasmids or with plasmids expressing full length wild-type S (S-WT) or full length mutant S (S-D1128A, S-D1128E, S-D1128N and S-N1056K-pp) (1.6MB, zip)"}
