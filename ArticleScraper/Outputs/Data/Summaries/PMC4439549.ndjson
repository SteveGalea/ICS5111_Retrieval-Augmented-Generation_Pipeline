{"summary": "hantavirus infections are responsible for human disease worldwide with up to 200,000 cases estimated per year. these zoonotic agents can cause Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome (HFRS) or Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) with case fatality rates of up to 50%. the mere existence of these vastly uncharacterized viruses induces speculation about their emergence in further hosts. recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases demonstrate a high necessity for intensive studies of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses. here we investigated the presence of hantavirus antibodies in humans living in the Ta National Park in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire as part of the West African Guinean Forest Block. serum samples were collected from 16 villages in Ta National Park of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 2007 and five villages in Salonga National Park of DR Congo in 2011. the sera were frozen directly in the field in liquid nitrogen. participants were also asked for professional status to estimate possible virus exposure and for recent health problems. a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed using recombinant nucleocapsid antigens from prototypical hantaviruses. all positive samples were tested in an in-house Western Blot (WB) with Sangassou virus antigen and by recomLine HantaPlus strip blot (Mikrogen, Germany) serodiagnostic results were established in Excel\u00ae for Windows. serodiagnostic results were transferred to Stata (Stata/SE12.0 for Windows, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) seroprevalences were calculated including 95% confidence intervals (CI) Ta CI 0/26 Tieleoula CI 2/36 (5.6%) Tienkoula CI 2/39 (5.5%) Ziriglo CI 1/68 (1.5%) Total CI 27/687 (3.9%) Bekombo DRC 0/3 Ipope DRC 1/57 (1.8%) Iyoko DRC 0/1 Lompole DRC 4/134 (3.0%) Nganda DRC 2/100 (2.0%) Total DRC 7/295 (2.4%) hantavirus seropositive in all three test formats considered as seropositive. focus reduction neutralization assay against dobrava-Belgrade, Puumala, and Sangassou viruses was performed for selected samples. Molecular testing Samples with high absorbance values in ELISA were also tested for hantavirus IgM antibodies. seropositive participants from both study sites according to profession, age, and gender in both countries. profession agriculture 14/356 (3.9%) House work 9/255 (3.5%) Pupils 3/134 (2.2%) Teacher/student 0/27 Sales/business 1/24 (4.2%) Cook/restaurant 0/19 Tailor 1/17 (5.9%) Driver/mechanic 0/16 Fisher 1/16 (6.25%) Hunter/butcher 0/7 Healthcare 0/5 Total 29/900 Age 1\u201310 1/3 seropositive individuals were detected in 10/16 villages in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. the prevalence per village ranged from 0 to 8.8%. there was no statistically significant effect of gender, age, or occupation on serology status. 36% of the participants reported at least one type of recent health problem. most common were malaria (n = 127), cough (n = 55), back pain (n = 47), and abdominal pain (n = 37). no hanta positive person reported fever only. the primary screening ELISA detected 229/982 seropositive samples against Sangassou virus antigen and only 28/982 against Puumala virus antigen. thirty out of the 34 seropositive samples were found to be reactive (12 of them even exclusively) against Sangassou virus antigen. the prevalence per village ranged from 0 to 8.8%. there was no statistical difference in prevalence between the villages. there was no statistically significant effect of gender, age, or occupation on serology status. people in the two studied african regions carry antibodies against hantavirus. seroprevalence rates of 3.9% in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and 2.4% in DR Congo were ascertained. hantavirus seroprevalence was found in the average populations. hantavirus-seropositive people did not report more health problems than the rest of the study group. in future studies a specific survey should be a focal point for an investigation of hantavirus disease within the tropical forest biome. the cascade of confirmatory tests was used to exclude false positive results even though it might have decreased the sensitivity. the fact that the primary screening ELISA detected 229/982 samples as positive against Sangassou virus but only 28/982 samples positive against Puumala virus. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
