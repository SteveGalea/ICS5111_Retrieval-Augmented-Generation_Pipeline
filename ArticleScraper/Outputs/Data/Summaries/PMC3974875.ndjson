{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) that causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. the first human cases of NiV infection were identified during an outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u20131999. more recently, outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh and India almost yearly since 2001 [1], [4]. human xenograft mouse models have previously been used to study tissue development and cancer as well as the pathogenesis of infectious agents. the majority of viral pathogenesis studies involving human xenograft mice focus on human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) the distal respiratory tract comprises of primitive alveolar spaces that are lined with both cells that have flat (type 1) and larger rounded (type 2) pneumocyte morphology. alveolar walls of xenografts were thicker than those of normal adult human lungs. expression patterns of ephrin B2, the receptor of NiV, was similar to that seen in normal human lung tissue [23] NiV replication in human lung xenografts involves exposure to the virus through the respiratory epithelium. viremia was detected in a blood sample of 1 animal on day 10 post infection. viremia was detected in a blood sample of 1 animal on day 10 post infection. SG mice were challenged intradermally with the same dose (Table 1). the IP challenge with NiV confirmed that infection resulted in detectable viremia in 1 animal with virus spreading to the human lung xenografts. viremia and subsequent spread to other organs in the absence of disease. virus was determined in human lung and mouse tiisues and whole blood by TCID50%. virus was detected with an anti N antibody as described in Materials & Methods. no gross pathologic lesions were observed in the human lung grafts. syncytia formation could be observed in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium. fibrinoid necrosis was observed in some of the vasculature as well as recruitment of granulocytes. viral nucleocapsid protein (N) expression in human lung grafts was examined with immunohistochemistry. expression of NiV N coincided with the focal areas of histopathological changes on day 3 pi. by day 10, widespread expression of NiV N was observed throughout the human lung tissues. pulmonary vasculature positive for NiV antigen on day 3 post infection (40 magnification) small focal area in mouse lung tissue positive for NiV antigen (red) on day 10 post infection (10 magnification) bronchi, V = pulmonary vasculature. T2 = type 2 pneumocyte. expression of eotaxin-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, VEGF, IP-10, IL-1 and IL-6 started by day 5 pi. expression of GM-CSF, TNF, VEGF, IP-10, IL-1 and IL-6 gradually declined over time. cytokine and chemokines profiles were similar between lung xenografts. structures included bronchi that were partially surrounded by cartilage. bronchi divide into bronchioles and terminal bronchioles lined by cuboidal to flat epithelium. distal respiratory tract comprises of primitive alveolar spaces. NiV replication in human lung xenografts involves exposure to the virus through the respiratory epithelium. tissues were directly injected with the virus to mimic this route in human lung xenografts that lack air exchange. two non-grafted NSG mice that were challenged intradermally as controls did not develop any clinical signs. viremia was detected in a blood sample of 1 animal on day 10 post infection in which a low level (300 TCID50/mL) of infectious NiV was determined. virus was not detected in organs from non-grafted NSG mice that were challenged intradermally with the same dose. infected lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) no gross pathologic lesions were observed in the human lung grafts. the main histopathological features of NiV infection in these tissues were the characteristic syncytia formation (Figure 3C) and areas of necrosis (Figure 3D) Syncytia formation could be observed in bronchial epithelium (Figure 3C), alveolar epithelium (Figure 3E) and vascular endothelium (Figure 3F). viral nucleocapsid protein (N) expression in human lung grafts was examined with immunohistochemistry. expression of NiV N coincided with the focal areas of histopathological changes on day 3 pi. by day 10, widespread expression of NiV N was observed throughout the human lung tissues. bronchial epithelium positive for NiV antigen in a syncytium (black arrow) on day 3 post infection (40 magnification). pulmonary vasculature positive for NiV antigen on day 3 post infection (40 magnification). NiV infection in human lung resulted in the expression of several cytokines/chemokines, including eotaxin-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, VEGF, IP-10, IL-1 and IL-6 starting by day 5 pi. expression of GM-CSF, TNF, VEGF, IP-10, IL-1 and IL-6 gradually declined over time. the cytokine and chemokines profiles were similar between lung studies on the molecular mechanisms of NiV-mediated pathogenesis have been hampered by the lack of biologically relevant in vitro models for studying the initial host responses to NiV infection in the human lung [7], [13], [15]. to fill this gap, we recently showed that NiV can efficiently replicate in primary epithelial cells from the human respiratory tract. strain used in this study to allow for comparison of histopathology and viral tropism. multinucleated giant cells were occasionally observed in alveolar spaces. bronchial epithelium rarely showed histopathological changes. cytokines and especially IL-6, IP-10 and VEGF were upregulated during NiV infection in the human lung. previous studies have shown that NiV infection in mice engrafted with human lung tissues did not result in clinical signs. VEGF is expressed by human respiratory epithelial cells during NiV infection. this suggests that VEGF may be partly responsible for increased pulmonary hemorrhage, endothelial destruction, and alveolar remodeling in an emphysema-like phenotype. this suggests inflammation could be observed in this model when human immune cells are present. pathogenesis of respiratory disease caused by henipavirus infection may be valuable as candidates for future studies of the mechanism of henipavirus pathogenesis. henipavirus pathogenesis may be valuable as candidates for future studies of the mechanism of henipavirus pathogenesis. six fragments of human fetal lung from same donor (15\u201319 weeks of age) were sutured to muscle fascia. animals received appropriate post-surgery treatment including antibiotics and analgesics. animals were anesthetized by chamber induction (5 Liters/min 100% O2 and 3\u20135% isoflurane) titration was performed using a TCID50 assay on 96-well plates. plates were incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. wells were scored for cytopathic effect (CPE) an Alexa 546 labeled secondary antibody (Life Technologies) was used for detection of the anti NiV N antibody. an Alexa 488 conjugated streptavidin (R&D Systems) was used for detection of the anti-CD31 antibody. animal work was performed by certified staff in an AAALAC approved facility. discarded tissue from deceased human fetuses was obtained via a non-profit partner. six fragments of human fetal lung from the same donor (15\u201319 weeks of age) were sutured to muscle fascia in the dorsal subcutaneous space in each mouse. animal infection Twelve weeks post-engraftment, animals were transferred to an ABSL-4 facility. animals were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs. TCID50 assay on 96-well plates (1104 Vero cells per well) plates were incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. wells scored for cytopathic effect (CPE) Virus concentrations were calculated as TCID50 per gram of tissue. as anti ephrin B2 and B3 antibodies and an Alexa 488 conjugated streptavidin (R&D Systems) were used for detection of the anti-CD31 antibody. the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
