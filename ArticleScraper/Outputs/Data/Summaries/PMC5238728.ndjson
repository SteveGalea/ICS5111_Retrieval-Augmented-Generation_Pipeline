{"summary": "genome-wide shRNA screen was performed in a pair of isogenic HCT116 cell lines harboring either PIK3CA oncogenic mutation H1047R (PI3K Mut) or not (PI3K wild-type) these lines were derived from the parental HCT116 line after inactivation of either the wild-type or the Mut allele. the relative distribution of each shRNA in the cell population was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) KS metrics were applied to the lethality score between the PI3K Mut and wild-type cells for each shRNA to determine a synthetic lethality score. a gene set derived from the Reactome database that contained genes essential for PI3K pathway activation was enriched 80% over expected (P 0.05, Fisher's exact test) the ribosome pathway (KEGG) and the related translation pathway (Reactome) were significantly enriched in the list of genes ranked by their PI3K synthetic lethality score. the pathway of splicing was also enriched (P = 0.01; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.12) we performed an integrated analysis of the data from our PI3K SL screen in isogenic HCT116 cells with two other data sets from RNAi screens performed by other institutions on a panel of different cancer cell lines. we first applied ATARIS (analytic technique for assessment of RNAi by similarity) on the Achilles and COLT-Cancer data sets to identify shRNAs that, based on their phenotypic pattern across multiple cell lines, are more likely to affect their intended target genes the PI3K.AKT.mTOR.Activation.Pathway was strongly enriched in both RNAi data sets (Achilles data set: 46% enrichment; COLT-Cancer data set: 84% enrichment) as a negative control, we compared cancer cell lines harboring or not harboring oncogenic KRAS mutations in the Achilles data set. richment in the top 10% = 445%, proteasome (enrichment in the top 10% = 497%), and splicing pathways (enrichment in the top 10% = 308%, FDR 1 104 for all three pathways) the common enrichment from multiple orthogonal screens and databases of these three pathways was more prominent in the combined analysis compared with the analysis of the screening on isogenic cell lines by itself. treatment with the translation elongation inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) or lactimidomycin (LTM) resulted in an 30%\u201340% decrease in the relative survival of Mut versus wild-type cells. the increase in cell death with translation inhibitors in PI3K Mut cells versus wild-type cells was higher than for Torin1/2 or NVP-BEZ235. a drug concentration of 0 nM corresponds to DMSO control. a mixture of HCT116 PI3K Mut and wild-type cells transduced with pHAGE-Ind10-mirE encoding the indicated shRNAs was treated with or without 1 g/mL doxycycline. we found a similar effect in PIK3CA and E545K cells. in contrast, KRAS Mut versus wild-type cell lines did not show a significant difference in the induction of cell death from protein synthesis inhibition. in1 and Torin2 did not further increase selective growth inhibition of PI3K Mut cells versus wild-type compared with treatment with the drugs or EIF1AX shRNAs individually. proteasome inhibition shows synthetic lethality with PI3K oncogenic mutations. proteasome machinery was significantly enriched among the list of PI3K SL hits. PI3K Mut and wild-type HCT116 and DLD1 cells were up-regulated (greater than twofold) this increase was mTOR-dependent, since the expression of both genes in PI3K Mut cells was reduced by Torin2 and rapamycin treatment. this increase was mTOR-dependent, since the expression of both genes in PI3K Mut cells was reduced by rapamycin treatment. MCAs were performed by using the indicated drug and concentration as in Figure 3A. all drugs were used at 50 nM concentration. difference between samples treated with CHX versus CHX + MG132. a luciferase-based reporter assay confirmed a significant increase in proteasome activity in PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells. treatment of the cells with different inhibitors of the proteasome resulted in selective inhibition of cell growth in PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells. similar selective inhibition was found in PTEN/ compared with PTEN+/+ cells (Supplemental Fig. S4D) the combined inhibition of translation and the proteasome significantly diminished the inhibition of either pathway alone in PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells. mice were then treated with either vehicle (PBS) or 0.5 mg/kg bortezomib by intraperitoneal injection once daily for 28 d. samples were first classified according to the presence or absence of an oncogenic mutation in PIK3CA and/or the presence or absence of an inactivating mutation or deletion in PTEN. also given the role of RTK mutation/amplification in promoting PI3K pathway hyperactivation, tumors that had mutations or amplifications in EGFR or ERBB2 were classified among the tumors with PI3K pathway activation. the tables show the HR and P-value of the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, including the PI3K SL signature and other clinical covariates for all colorectal cancer patients. a genome-wide screen was performed in a pair of isogenic HCT116 colon cancer cell lines harboring either PIK3CA oncogenic PI3K mutations. PI3K Mut and PI3K wild-type cells were transduced with a retroviral shRNA library targeting 18,300 human genes. the relative distribution of each shRNA in the cell population was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PCR-amplified half-hairpins. each dot represents a single gene present in the genome-wide library. KS metrics were applied to the lethality score between the PI3K Mut and wild-type cells for each shRNA to determine a synthetic lethality score. a gene set derived from the Reactome database that contained genes essential for PI3K pathway activation was enriched 80% over expected (P 0.05, Fisher's exact test) the pathway of splicing was also enriched (P = 0.01; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.12). the major dependencies in the PI3K pathway are represented. the combined P-value of each gene for synthetic lethality with the PI3K pathway is indicated with the heat map. project Achilles data set of RNAi screens performed in 102 cancer cell lines. we first applied ATARIS to identify shRNAs that are more likely to affect their intended target genes relative to their off-target effects. PI3K Mut cells were defined as those cancer cell lines bearing an oncogenic activating mutation in PIK3CA. we compared cancer cell lines harboring or not harboring oncogenic KRAS mutations in the Achilles data set. we obtained a combined P-value, derived from all three PI3K data sets. this result highlights the utility of performing a meta-analysis. 312 of 1045 genes (29%) targeted by the library had significant SL scores in PI3K Mut cells compared with wild-type cells. translation, proteasome, and ribosome pathways were all significantly enriched (FDR 0.3), corroborating our previous findings. cell death assays with 7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) staining revealed that CHX or LTM induced significantly more cell death in PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells. the increase in cell death with translation inhibitors in PI3K Mut cells was higher than for Torin1/2 or NVP-BEZ235. a mixture of PI3K Mut and wild-type cells transduced with pHAGE-Ind10-mirE encoding the indicated shRNAs was treated with or without 1 g/mL doxycycline to induce expression of the shRNA. Western blot was performed and visualized using the Licor system with the indicated antibodies after 72 h of treatment. we found a similar effect in PTEN/ cells, which exhibit PI3K pathway activation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. in contrast, KRAS Mut versus wild-type cell lines did not show a significant difference in cell death from protein synthesis inhibition as well as mTOR signaling inhibition. PI3K pathway activation due to oncogenic PIK3CA mutation or PTEN inactivation confers a specific susceptibility to ribosome and protein translation that is likely dependent on mTOR. proteasome machinery was also significantly enriched among the list of PI3K SL hits. PI3K Mut and wild-type cells were treated with 50 M CHX. the expression of both genes in PI3K Mut cells was reduced by rapamycin treatment. mTOR-dependent, since the expression of both genes was reduced. all drugs were used at 50 nM concentration. asterisks refer to significant difference between samples treated with CHX versus CHX + MG132 and LTM versus LTM. treatment of the cells with different inhibitors of the proteasome resulted in selective inhibition of cell growth in PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells. similar selective inhibition was found in PTEN/ compared with PTEN+/+ cells. autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 did not exhibit a selective effect on PI3K Mut cells. mice were treated with either vehicle (PBS or 0.5 mg/kg bortezomib) mice showed a significantly stronger response to bortezomib than PI3K wild-type cell tumors. oncogenic PI3K mutations in tumors promote sensitivity to bortezomib in vivo. ribosome and proteasome genes were significantly enriched in tumors with PI3K pathway activation. a PI3K SL gene signature was derived by considering the top hits of the SL genes identified in the meta-analysis. in order to derive a PI3K SL signature for colon cancer, we considered the meta-analysis described above and selected the genes with a combined P-value of 0.02 (350 genes) we derived an average expression score for this PI3K SL gene signature for each tumor sample in colorectal cancer patients. our analysis identified novel vulnerabilities for cancer cells harboring PI3K pathway activation. the two major pathways that our combined analysis identified as SL with oncogenic PI3K pathway activation were the ribosome/translation and the proteasome pathways. nascent mRNA transcripts improved the response to chemotherapy in a murine model of EuMyc lymphoma. bortezomib (Velcade) has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. PI3K SL genes identified by our analysis also likely represent bona fide SL factors in human tumors. shRNA genome-wide library targeting 18,300 human genes (four shRNA per gene) was cloned into the retroviral MSCV vector. 293T cells were transfected using Trans-IT Minus. the supernatant was harvested after 36 h and stored at 80\u00b0C. the cells were exposed to the appropriate amount of virus for 24 h. negative binomial distribution was used to determine the significance in the relative representation of each shRNA between the end and start populations. a positive lethality score corresponds to an shRNA that undergoes a significant drop between the start and the end populations. a negative lethality score corresponds to an shRNA that undergoes a significant drop between the start and the end populations. PI3K wild-type cells were defined as those cell lines with a wild-type KRAS gene that also did not have mutations or amplifications in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, or ERBB2 oncogenes. the list of the cell lines used for these comparisons is in Supplemental Tables S4 and S5. gene expression analysis For each gene, we calculated the P-value for overexpression in HCT116 PTEN/ cells versus PTEN+/+ using a one-sided t-test. GSEA was performed through the stand-alone software available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp. drug-based MCA The competition assay used to test candidate genes/drugs (PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors) from the screen was modified from a previous protocol. 20,000 GFP-labeled PI3K Mut and ds-Tomato-labeled wild-type cells were mixed. a concentration of 0 nM of the drug corresponds to the DMSO control treatment. the presence of an asterisk indicates a statistical significance for the difference in the fitness of Mut cells in the treatment samples (drug or shRNA) the luminescence was read after 10\u201330 min of incubation. the effects of bortezomib on tumor growth in mice nu/nu mice were purchased. DNA was harvested from the cells by standard procedures. half-hairpins were amplified by PCR before Illumina sequencing. RNAeasy minikit was synthesized using the high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate using the gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Fast 7500 machine. GAPDH and ACTB were used as internal controls for normalization. PI3K mutant cells were defined as those cancer cell lines bearing an oncogenic activating PIK3CA mutation. PI3K wild-type cells were defined as those cell lines having a wild-type PIK3CA gene that also did not have mutations or amplifications in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, PTEN, EGFR, or ERBB2 oncogenes. 104 cells were plated in 100 L in each well of a 96-well plate. after 48\u201372 h, the cells were treated with the drug to be tested or solvent only. the next day, the cells were washed twice by PBS and triedpsinized. EGFR were classified as having a hyperactive PI3K pathway. tumors that were normal for all of these parameters were considered wild type for PI3K pathway. the PI3K SL gene expression signature was derived from the PI3K SL gene list. 20,000 GFP-labeled PI3K Mut and ds-Tomato-labeled wild-type cells were mixed and seeded at a ratio of 1:3 to 1:1 in each well. the fitness of Mut cells was determined at the end of the assay as the ratio between the percentage of Mut cells in the sample treated with the drug (or shRNA) BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) was performed comparing samples treated with shRNA specific for the gene of interest with samples treated with shRNAs specific for Luciferase. promega Proteasome-Glo cell-based assays measure proteasome activity associated with proteasome complex in cultured cells. volumes were calculated using the following formula: mm3 = length width width 0.5."}
