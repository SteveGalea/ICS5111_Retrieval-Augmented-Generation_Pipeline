{"summary": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), in the subfamily Coronavirinae, are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses with spherical virions of 120\u2013160 nm. they are among the largest RNA viruses, with complex polyadenylated genomes of 26\u201332 kb. they are divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (-CoV) knowledge about CoV diversity has increased significantly since the SARS pandemic. many of the novel viruses described in the last decade were identified in bats of various species. ken et al., 2010; tong et al., 2009b; Woo et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2010); ken et al., 2009b; ken et al., 2009b; ken et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2010; ken et al., 2006; ken et al., 2006; evotis, Myotis lucifugus, Myotis occultus and Myotis volans were unique compared with CoVs found in Asia. in south America, Carrington et al. (2008) identified an -CoV in two species of leaf-nosed bats, Carollia perspicillata and Glossophaga soricina. it is also unknown whether -CoVs exist in the Americas, or whether the a total of 1046 samples were collected from 606 individuals, of 42 different bat species. a total of 606 bats were sampled across three sites. the number of CoV PCR positives (Pos) are indicated in parentheses. artibeus phaeotis Frugivorous 21 (1) [11b] 3 3 (2) [11a, 11b] 9 36 Artibeus jamaicensis Frugivorous 33 (2) [5b] 23 (1) [4] 17 (2) [5a] 20 93 Artibeus watsoni Frugivorous 5 3 7 2 17 Glossophaga soricina Nectivorous 1 8 12 27 48 Glossophaga commissarisi Nectiv Phylloderma stenops Frugivorous 2 2 Mormoopidae Mormoops megalohyla Insectivorous 9 2 11 Pteronotus davyi Insectivorous 1 1 2 Pteronotus parnellii Insectivorous 1 (1) [10] 1 10 7 19 Molossidae Nyctinomops macrotis Insectivorous 10 10 Tadarida brasiliensis In ness of 32 was recorded, and the calculated Shannon\u2013Wiener diversity index (H\u2032) was 2.81 (Table 2). a comparison of undisturbed and disturbed habitat in Chiapas revealed no significant difference in richness and diversity (P = 0.11) in campeche the overall species richness was 16 and the diversity index H\u2032 was 2.167 (Table 2). total 332 32 2.81 9 6 1.735 Campeche Undisturbed 144 13 2.079 9 4 1.149 Disturbed 96 13 2.01 8 5 1.494 Total 240 16 2.167 17 7 1.732 D.F.

(Mexico City), eight species were captured and the diversity index H\u2032 was 1.69 (Table 2). one of the -CoVs (Mex_Cov-6) was closely related to a virus identified previously in an Eptesicus fuscus bat. we therefore extend the known geographical range of this virus to south-eastern Mexico and present the discovery of a further 12 novel CoVs. coV-positive sample types included 27 rectal swabs, four oral swabs and one blood sample. the high number of positive rectal samples agrees with previous studies. phylogenetic analyses of this short fragment show that all of the -CoVs detected in phyllostomid bats cluster together. the same is true of the -CoVs Mex_CoV-11a and Mex_CoV-11b. they could be present in either Artibeus lituratus or Artibeus phaeotis. the close association of Mex-CoV-7 and -8 with Myotis velifer and Tadarida brasiliensis also suggest strong host specificity. mex_CoV-5b was the only virus to be found in two distinct (but related) genera, having been detected in both Artibeus and Carollia bats. such findings have been reported previously, although rarely. increased efforts for viral discovery in this region will be required to investigate whether disturbed habitats provide increased risk or opportunity for viruses to spillover into new species. phylogenetic analysis of the new human -CoV showed that the virus clusters with viruses from bats in the vespertilionid/molossid families. the closest relative is the Mex_CoV-9 virus that was identified in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat from this study. artibeus was the only genus shown to contain more than one CoV. but bats in this genus were also the most frequently sampled. other studies have also identified multiple CoVs within a single species. a significant difference was seen in CoV diversity across gradients. bats were collected at three different sites in south-eastern Mexico. the first two sites represent regions of high species diversity. total nucleic acid was extracted from all samples using the EasyMag platform. cDNA synthesis performed using SuperScript III first strand synthesis supermix. PCR products of the expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector and sequenced using standard M13R primers. akmul (Campeche), and campeche bats were collected in two landscape gradients, assigned as 'Undisturbed' forest. 'Disturbed' (D), defined as the transition zone between areas of primary vegetation and agriculture/livestock, and by the presence of urban areas. nets were opened at dusk and remained open for 4 h consecutively. identification of animals was made using field guides. PCR products of the expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector and sequenced using standard M13R primers. if an individual tested positive for CoV, the species of the bat was secondarily confirmed with genetic barcoding. 'Disturbed' (D), defined as the transition zone between areas of primary vegetation and agriculture/livestock. nets were opened at dusk and remained open for 4 h consecutively. identification of animals was made using field guides. Sequences were edited using Geneious Pro (5.6.4) alignments were constructed using clustal w, executed through Geneious. maximum-likelihood trees were built in mega (5.0) and bootstrapped using 1000 repetitions."}
