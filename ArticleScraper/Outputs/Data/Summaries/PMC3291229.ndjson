{"summary": "the virus-positive specimens comprised 90 specimens with HRSV, 19 with HMPV, and 2 with adenovirus. LRTI included the diagnoses of bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and laryngotracheobronchitis. the amplified DNA fragments for the NP1 gene and NS1 gene were 354 bp and 291 bp respectively. the amplified DNA fragments for the NP1 gene and NS1 gene were 354 bp and 291 bp. from 1-year-old children, 8 (29.6%) of 27 1- to 2-year-old children, and 4 (14.8%) of 27 3- to 5-year-old children. other viruses were also detected in 10 (37%) of 27 HBoV-positive specimens. nucleotide alignment of a 245-bp portion of the NS1 gene was prepared by using BioEdit v7.0. nodal confidence values indicate the results of bootstrap resampling (n = 1,000). we confirmed HBoV infection in hospitalized children with acute LRTI in south Korea. further prospective population-based studies are needed to confirm the role of HBoV in LRTI in children."}
