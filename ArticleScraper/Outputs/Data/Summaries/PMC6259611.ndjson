{"summary": "two thirds of the coronavirus genome encode the replicase activity. a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and viral proteinases. the remaining one third encodes structural proteins and small group-specific ORFs. the N protein has been a major protein target in the exploration of anti-IBV medicine [11,12,13,14,15,16]. aromatic and medicinal plants produce essential oils containing both hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives. essential oils have been widely used in traditional medicine. the CC50 values of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene were all above 10 mM. and (-)--pinene showed higher maximum noncytotoxic concentration (TD0, 7.88 0.06 mM) than (-)--pinene (6.09 0.31 mM) these two values were both much higher than that of ribavirin (0.78 0.15 mM) (P 0.01). TD0 was the concentration that inhibited 50% of IBV replication in vero cells. c The selective index (SI) was calculated as CC50/IC50. a SI of 4 or more should be appropriate for an antiviral agent. (-)--pinene showed the maximum noncytotoxic antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 7.88 0.06 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 86.98 3.04% for IBV. inhibition of 67.64 2.31% in the pretreatment virus phase. biochemical studies indicated that the bioactivity of N protein is an important target for the replication of IBV virus [11,13,16]. explicit solvent docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the inhibiting mechanisms of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene with NTD. the modeled structures of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene bound to the nucleocapsid protein were calculated to be -36.83 kcal mol-1. (-)--pinene had strong van der Waals interactions (EvdW) with residues SerA34, GlnA37, PheA137, AspA138, GlnA139, GlyB147 and ProB149. the values were equaling 2.66 and 2.30 kcal mol1, respectively (Figure 4 and Table 2). aspA138 1.43 0.94 2.37 2.35 0.31 2.66 GlnA139 2.21 0.43 2.64 2.42 0.23 2.65 TyrA140 1.66 0.08 1.58 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 methylene group (=CH2) of (-)--pinene was oriented towards residue AlaA33. the binding of RNA may interfer with (-)--pinene and this effect is lower than that of (-)--pinene. this effect is consistent with the above experimental data. these results indicated compared with ribavirin, both (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene possessed lower cytotoxicity on Vero cells. therefore, we could infer that the antiviral effects of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene were not due to any cytotoxicity. ribavirin showed the maximum antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 0.78 0.15 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 90.18 2.80% for IBV. ribavirin interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. inhibitions of (-)-pinenes against IBV appear to moderately occur before entering the cell but much stronger occur after penetration of the virus into the cell. biochemical studies indicated that the bioactivity of N protein is an important target for the replication of IBV virus. the modeled structures of (-)--pinene (black) and (-)--pinene (red) bound to the nucleocapsid (N) protein were calculated to be -36.83 kcal mol-1. the interactions energy of (-)--pinene with NTD was calculated to be -36.83 kcal mol-1. vdW, electrostatic and sum interaction energies (EvdW, Eele and Esum) involved (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene with the active-site residues of nucleocapsid (N) protein a. vdW, electrostatic and sum interaction energies (EvdW, Eele and Esum) involving (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene with the active-site aspB146 0.77 0.23 1.00 2.47 0.01 2.46 GlyB148 \u2014 1.58 0.55 1.03 ProB149 2.30 0.02 2.32 0.63 0.09 0.72 TrpB155 1.85 0.08 1.93 1.57 0.04 1.61 a Energy units in kcal mol1. the binding of (-)--pinene was mainly stabilized by van der Waals interactions. (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene exert their anti-IBV activities through inhibition of binding process between RNA and IBV N protein, with the former having the higher bioactivity. further studies on the anti-IBV drugs are urgently needed to support this point of view. BV-Gray stock cultures were prepared from supernatants of infected cells and stored at 80 \u00b0C. cells were seeded on a microtiter plate in the absence or presence of various concentrations (10 mM \u2013 0.005 mM) of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene for eight replicates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidied atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. concentration of (-)--pinene, (-)--pinene and ribavirin inhibited virus numbers by 50% (IC50) was determined from dose-response curves. cell monolayers were pretreated with (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene before infection. cell monolayers were pretreated with (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene before infection. the effect of (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene (or ribavirin) against IBV was also tested during the replication period by adding it after adsorption. each assay was run in eight replicates. each assay was run in eight replicates. the significance of difference was calculated by one-way analysis of variance, and values p 0.01 were considered significant. cells were grown in monolayer culture with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. the supernatants were discarded, washed with PBS twice and MTT reagent (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well. the plates were read on an ELISA reader at 570/630 nm. the maximum non-toxic concentration (TD0) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated by linear regression analysis. cell monolayers were pretreated with (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene before infection. viruses were incubated together with (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene before infection. cell monolayers were pretreated with (-)--pinene or (-)--pinene. the protein receptor N-terminal domain of N-protein (PDB ID: 2GEC) [11] from the RCSB Protein Data Bank was taken without the crystal water molecules [14] for convenience, it is named as NTD throughout this work. the geometries and partial atomic charges of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene were taken by applying the BFGS algorithm (Discover 3.0 module) [26], with the consistent-valence force-field ("}
