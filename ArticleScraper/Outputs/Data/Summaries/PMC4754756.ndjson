{"summary": "Xoo strains PXO99, 10208, and K3a, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines (Xag) were grown on PSA medium containing different niclosamide concentrations. niclosamide exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of 12 M. oryzae strains. we also tested the effects of parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone with anti-tumor activity, on the growth of the Xoo strains PXO99 and 10208. at lower concentrations, niclosamide had no effect on the growth of these E. coli strains, although it slightly inhibited growth at 50 g/ml (Fig. 1d). we grew the rice cultivar in a growth chamber for 12 weeks. we inoculated the plants with pathogen and niclosamide treatment. phenotypes of plants treated with pathogen only or pathogen plus niclosamide did not develop. leaves of PXO99-treated plants or niclosamide- and PXO99-treated plants were sampled at the indicated time points. the samples were ground, suspended in sterile water, and plated onto peptone-sucrose agar medium containing cephalexin. the numbers of bacterial colonies were then counted. leaves were inoculated with bacterial suspension using the leaf clipping method. sprayed with 8 g/ml niclosamide and examined leaf blight in both local and systemic leaves. wilting and lesion development were completely inhibited in inoculated leaves. leaves were inoculated with bacterial suspension using leaf-clipping method. half of leaves were covered with polythene bags (middle panel) and leaves were sprayed with niclosamide. niclosamide levels gradually increased in systemic leaves. leaves of 80-day-old plants were sprayed with 8 g/ml niclosamide. sHI-LOX, and OsACS2 were induced by niclosamide treatment. transcript expression levels increased with increasing niclosamide levels. but expression levels increased with increasing niclosamide levels. expression of pathogen-related genes in niclosamide-treated leaves. free SA and glucosyl-SA were evaluated in leaves of rice plants treated with 8 g/ml niclosamide. samples were harvested and SA and glucosyl-SA were extracted using a methanol-based method. Xoo strains PXO99, 10208, and K3a, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines (Xag) showed that growth of the Xoo strains was completely inhibited by 5 g/ml niclosamide, whereas Xag growth was inhibited by 15 g/ml niclosamide. we also tested the effects of parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone with anti-tumor activity, on the growth of the Xoo strains PXO99 and 10208. at lower concentrations, niclosamide had no effect on the growth of these E. coli strains, although it slightly inhibited growth at 50 g/ml. we grew the rice cultivar Nipponbare in a growth chamber for 12 weeks. we inoculated the plants with pathogen and niclosamide treatment. phenotypes of plants treated with pathogen only or pathogen plus niclosamide were examined. leaves of untreated and niclosamide-treated plants or niclosamide-treated plants were sampled at the indicated time points. the samples were ground, suspended in sterile water, and plated onto peptone-sucrose agar medium containing cephalexin. the numbers of bacterial colonies were then counted. leaves were inoculated with bacterial suspension using leaf clipping method. leaves were sprayed with 8 g/ml niclosamide. standard deviations of the means are indicated by vertical bars. leaf wilting and lesion development were completely inhibited in PXO99-inoculated leaves that had not been treated with niclosamide. leaves were inoculated with PXO99 bacterial suspension using leaf-clipping method. niclosamide levels gradually increased in systemic leaves. leaves of 80-day-old plants were sprayed with 8 g/ml niclosamide. Y45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, and OsHI-LOX were induced by niclosamide treatment. transcript expression levels increased with increasing niclosamide levels. expression of pathogen-related genes in niclosamide-treated leaves increased. free SA and glucosyl-SA were evaluated in leaves of rice plants treated with 8 g/ml niclosamide. samples were harvested and SA and glucosyl-SA were extracted using a methanol-based method. niclosamide has no effect on rice growth and development. more than 30 drugs have been used to protect rice from pathogen attack. some have broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal activity. others specifically target bacteria or fungi. niclosamide induced the expression of the defense-related genes OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, and OsHI-LOX. these results clearly indicate that niclosamide blocks the development of rice leaf blight by directly inhibiting Xoo bacterial growth. niclosamide also inhibited Xag growth, which causes bacterial leaf pustule disease in soybean45. niclosamide inhibited growth of the fungal pathogen M. oryzae. this effect was much weaker against pathogenic Xoo bacteria. niclosamide may also protect plants from fungal pathogens. niclosamide inhibits glucose uptake, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and anaerobic metabolism in parasitic helminths44. it also inhibits transcription and DNA binding of the NF pathway, and increases ROS levels to induce apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia cells50. niclosamide protects rice plants from bacterial leaf blight by inhibiting Xoo growth, inducing SA accumulation, and/or by inducing the expression of defense-related gene pathways. field tests evaluating the effects of niclosamide application on rice plants will provide information on whether it has adverse effects on other organisms or the food chain. Xoo and Xag strains were cultivated in peptone-sucrose broth containing 15 g/ml of the antibiotic cephalexin (Sigma-Aldrich), and grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. 2 l of each culture was grown on agar medium containing different concentrations of niclosamide. the MIC of niclosamide against both Xoo strains was narrowed down from 4.0 to 4.8 g/ml. the lowest concentration of niclosamide with no visible growth was taken as the MIC. the fully expanded uppermost leaves were inoculated with PXO99 by the leaf-clipping method, followed by treatment with various doses of niclosamide applied by foliar spraying every 4 days. as a control, mock inoculation was conducted with distilled water. after 16 days, leaves were photographed and lesion length was measured using imageJ software. the lesion length and bacterial population were expressed as the mean value plus/minus the standard deviation. the experiment was repeated five times under the same conditions. niclosamide-treated rice was sprayed with 40 g/ml niclosamide. cDNA was synthesized using 1 g of total RNA and an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit. an equal volume of cDNA was amplified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. rice (Oryza sativa sativa) japonica cultivar, Nipponbare, was used in this study. phenotypes of untreated and niclosamide-treated plants were measured at 70 days after seed maturation. stock solutions of niclosamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and parthenolide (Sigma-Aldrich) were made by dissolving the chemicals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. the stock solutions were diluted in distilled water before use. 2 l of each culture was grown on agar medium containing different concentrations of niclosamide. inoculated plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h and photographed. the lowest concentration of niclosamide with no visible growth was taken as the MIC. the cells were collected and centrifuged to remove exopolysaccharides. they were then resuspended in double-distilled water, producing more than 109 cell forming units (cfu) per ml. to treat rice with PXO99, plants were grown for 80 days in a greenhouse. leaf blight lesions with a length of 2 cm developed. leaves were treated with 8 g/ml niclosamide by foliar spraying every 4 days. lesion length and bacterial growth were estimated as described above. relative niclosamide concentration in each sample was compared with the 100 ppb niclosamide standard. determination of salicylic acid (SA) and its conjugate SA and the SA conjugate glucosyl-SA were extracted from 0.5 g of rice leaves treated with 8 g/ml niclosamide for 4 h. PCR primers were designed using Primer3plus (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi/). primers were used for quantitative PCR. three-week-old leaves were sprayed with 8 g/ml niclosamide at 4-day intervals until seed maturation. phenotypic characteristics of untreated and niclosamide-treated plants were measured at 70 days after planting."}
