{"summary": "we previously found that all known HIV-1 bnAbs are highly divergent from germline antibodies. germline antibodies of bnAbs could not bind to epitopes of respective mature antibodies. this led to a hypothesis that HIV-1 may have evolved to use the \u201choles\u201d in the human germline B cell receptor repertoire. this study helped to identify germline predecessors of bnAbs observed in normal individuals, and find maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs. the results corroborate that the HIV-1 may use a strategy to eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies due to the absence of closer anti-HIV antibody intermediates. 454 sequence data and retained only sequences of length more than 300 nucleotides (nt), covering the entire antibody variable domains consisting of the three complementarity determining regions (CDR) along with framework regions (FR) the output results from the IMGT/HighV-QUEST analysis in CSV files were stored at PostgreSQL database. for 454 sequencing, primer combinations used to amplify cDNA in separate reactions included the Roche A and B adaptor sequences along with target amplification sequence for heavy and light chain variable domains. the gene fragments were amplified in 20 cycles of PCR using the High Fidelity PCR Master from Roche. a total of 113,139 sequences were obtained from which 91,528 sequences were found as unique with each had >300 nt in length. a total of 113,139 sequences were obtained from which 91,528 sequences were found as unique with each had >300 nt in length. all antiviral-related germlines were expressed in human IgM repertoire. some preferential germline usages were noted, for example, HV1-69 gene in IGHV subgroups and KV3-20/LV2-14 genes in IGKV/IGLV subgroups.

The structural data for most of the bnAbs selected in this analysis were known and the heavy chains of these bnAbs were dominantly used. the increased number of VH mutations and longer HCDR3s are characteristics for the HVI-1 bnAbs when compared to other antiviral bnAbs. the gp41 membrane-proximal epitope region (MPER) binding site bnAbs, 2F5, and m66, formed distinct clusters. the closest b12 intermediate, designated as G3JY1, had three mutations each at HCDR1 and HCDR2 compared to the germline. favored maturation pathways could involve other intermediates too. the 454 sequence analysis of a large nave human antibody repertoire corresponding to the selected antiviral-related bnAbs revealed the germline V-gene usage, VDJ rearrangement, HCDR3 length diversity, and somatic mutations of potential intermediate antibodies of HIV-1 and other viral diseases. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
