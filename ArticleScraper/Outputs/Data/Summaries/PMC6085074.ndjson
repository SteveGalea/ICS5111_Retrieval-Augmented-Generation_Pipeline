{"summary": "pathogen transmission involving bat bites has been documented mostly for rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae) the common vampire bat can naturally transmit rabies to other species when biting to feed on blood, particularly to livestock and sometimes to humans. most bat species do not naturally bite humans unless intentional contacts occur (e.g., veterinarians involved in bat capture and handling, people trying to remove bats from houses) fruit bat Eidolon helvum, the most frequently hunted and traded bat species in many african countries, has been shown to be infected with Henipa-related viruses. the role of livestock as intermediate and amplifying hosts between wild animals and humans has been clearly demonstrated in several outbreaks, such as for Filovirus and Henipavirus. dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) act as reservoir host in which the MERS coronavirus could have circulated for more than 30 years before its first detection in humans. other animals such as llamas (Lama glama) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) have shown susceptibility to MERS coronavirus infection [19], suggesting a large host species range. zoonotic bacteria have been described in bat ectoparasites. but such investigations remain scarce for other infectious agents. the role of blood-feeding arthropods in pathogen spillover to humans remains highly speculative. transmission of infectious agents is highly dynamic in bats. periods of high prevalence of infected bats with Hendra and Marburg viruses have been shown to coincide with the timing of infectious agent spillover to other hosts."}
