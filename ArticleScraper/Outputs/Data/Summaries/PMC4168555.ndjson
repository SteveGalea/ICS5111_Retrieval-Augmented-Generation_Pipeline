{"summary": "there is little agreement on how to define \u201cglobal health diplomacy\u201d5-6 Generally, GHD refers to international diplomatic activities that (directly or indirectly) address issues of global health importance. GHD can encompass a broad set of activities and actors, such as formal delegations holding bilateral and multilateral negotiations on health issues, a combination of governmental and nongovernmental actors negotiating on health-related issues. Formal international bilateral and multilateral negotiations, such as those that take place at the world health Assembly and other multilateral forums and traditional negotiations between donor and recipient countries regarding official bilateral health assistance Negotiations around the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control The U.S. president's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Partnership Framework agreements on HIV/AIDS between the U.S. government and partner countries Multi-stakeholder diplomacy that often includes countries as well as non-state actors negotiating on health-related issues The global health proponents have mostly characterized GHD as a unique opportunity to raise the policy profile of global health. many politicians and foreign policy practitioners emphasize how support for health programs can help achieve foreign policy goals. foreign policy and national security goals often trumping global health objectives. global health has grown more interdisciplinary, with links increasingly being made between health and other areas such as international trade and intellectual property rights, agriculture, education, and the environment. the growing attention to the intersection between global health, diplomacy, and foreign policy interests has been seen as direct threats to national security and foreign policy interests. a broad set of diplomatic actors engaged in a series of formal and informal negotiations with representatives of the Indonesian government when it refused to share H5N1 virus samples. the Indonesian government was concerned that the country did not receive benefits from sharing these samples. the parties eventually resolved the immediate issue at hand, but discussions around benefit-sharing and pandemic influenza surveillance and prevention continue even today. global health diplomacy requires attention to issues of country ownership and fostering equitable partnerships. players must now address a set of newly recognized health issues that face developing countries, such as non-communicable diseases and mental health. if global health and foreign policy practitioners work together for greater mutual understanding and coordination, we can create conditions whereby all parties can benefit from the growing profile of GHD."}
