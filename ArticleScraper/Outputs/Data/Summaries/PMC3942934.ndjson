{"summary": "the RABV virus standard (CVS)-11 strain was obtained from the Changchun Institute of Veterinary Science (Changchun, China) female BALB/c mice (weighing 13\u201315 g) were used to assess the antiviral activities of the rAAV2 in vivo. pAAV-N796 or rAAV-Neg vectors were produced by liposome-mediated co-transfection of pAAV-N796 or pAAV-Neg, pAAV-RC and pHelper in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were fed 10 ml of fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS without antibiotics. the cells and suspensions were harvested at 72 hr post infection. rAAV particles were then purified by HiTrap heparin column chromatography. peak virus fractions were collected and dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mM MgSO4. samples were then concentrated using a 100K-MicroSep centrifugal concentrator. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) the levels of N mRNA transcripts were determined by qPCR using Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) the resultant blots were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to RABV N protein (1:200) or a mouse monoclonal antibody to -actin (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) mice were infected with 10 LD50 of RABV CVS-11 for intracerebral challenge and 20 LD50 of RABV CVS-11 for intramuscular challenge. all animal researches were conducted under the guidance of the CDC's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the animal research in our study was approved by the Jilin Province Animal Disease Control Center. only at 72 and 96 hr post infection was the RABV titer reduced significantly (P0.05) these results indicated that the inoculation of rAAV-N796 before RABV infection could inhibit the virus replication well. but that inoculation of rAAV-N796 after RABV infection inhibited virus replication only at later time points. the antiviral activity of the rAAV-N796 in NA cells depended on the inoculation titer of rAAV-N796, as shown in Fig. 2C and 2E. the cells were transduced with different titers of rAAV-N796 (1, 10 and 100 vg/cell) and were infected with 0.01 MOI of the RABV CVS-11 virus. rAAV-N796 could significantly inhibit replication of the CVS-11 virus in RABV-infected mice. compared with the rAAV-N796-treated mice, all mice showed higher survival rates. the forth group of mice (n=11) was muscularly challenged with 20 LD50 of lethal CVS-11 and muscularly challenged with 20 LD50 of lethal CVS-11 24 hr later. the challenged mice were observed for 21 days, and the survival percent was calculated. treatment of mice with rAAV-N796 demonstrated 62.5 4.7% protection. all the mice treated with rAAV-Neg died at 21 days post-challenge. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to suppress virus replication in vitro and in vivo without damaging the host cell. rAAV-N796 recognized the sequence-5\u2019-GAGGAAGATAAGAAGAA-3\u2019. the sequence is very conserved in most of RABV strains. rAAV-2-based rAAV vectors can transduce muscle, the liver, the brain, the retina and the lungs. rAAV2 has emerged as a vector of choice for gene transfer to the central nervous system. this may be attributed to AAV inefficiently infecting mature dendritic cells. the antiviral effect of intracerebral inoculation with rAAV-N796 was better than with intramuscular inoculation (38% survival) the survival rate of intracerebral inoculation and infection group (50% survival) was lower than that of intracerebral inoculation and intramuscular infection group (63% survival). the time of injection with rAAV-N796 should be within 24 hr. the antiviral activity of rAAV-N796 in NA cells depended on the titer of rAAV-N796. in the in vivo experiment, rAAV-N796 pretreatment did not achieve complete protection."}
