Pilgrims\u2019 KAP levels were defined as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d based on Bloom\u2019s cut off point. pilgrims within the range of 60\u201379% are considered moderate and score below 59% are regarded as having an unacceptable attitude [21]. a cross-sectional study was conducted among Umrah and Hajj pilgrims attending weekly orientation course organized by private Hajj/Umrah companies between July and November 2018. the sample size was determined using a margin of error of 5%, a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and an expected response rate of 70% to most of the main questions. 89.7% (202/225) and only 10.3% (23/225) are Hajj pilgrims. questionnaire was developed by an epidemiologist, microbiologist, health educationist, and medical statistician. it included questions about vaccination history and previous Hajj and Umrah experience. knowledge section consisted of 29 items aimed at accessing and evaluating the general knowledge of pilgrims about the etiology, spread, and transmission, signs and symptoms, complications, risk factors and prevention of respiratory tract infections. twelve questions on practices were used to evaluate the actual compliance and uptake of various preventive measures. the questionnaire was designed to be anonymous, and informed consent was obtained from every respondent. the data were kept confidential and the results did not identify the respondents personally. the education level of the respondents was secondary school 80 (35.6%) followed by bachelor\u2019s degree holders 78 (34.7%). civil servant accounted for 95 (42.2%), pensioners 41 (18.2%) and 31 (13.8%) housewives. most of the respondents were aware of the etiology. 54.2% of pilgrims held misunderstanding that allergies caused RTIs. only 23.1% and 25.8% were aware that respiratory tract infections could be transmitted through the air. 60.9% thought RTIs could be spread by water. i Senior citizens aged 65 and older 157 (69.8) 68 (30.2) ii Smokers 128 (56.9) 97 (43.1) iii Asthmatics 163 (72.4) 62 (27.6) iv Diabetics 78 (34.7) 147 (65.3) v People with arthritis 72 (32.0) 153 (28.9) K5 What are the complications of flu-like illnesses. the majority of the pilgrims had an unacceptable attitude (93.8%) towards the prevention of respiratory tract infections. few (6.2%) of the participants had a moderate acceptable attitude based on the mean total attitude score. but only 5.8% and 1.3% of participants disagreed and strongly disagreed with the opinion of being opposed to face mask usage. ii cover his mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing 1 (0.4) 26 (11.6) 40 (17.8) 87 (38.7) 71 (31.6) ii cover his mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing 8 (3.6) 15 (6.7) 110 (48.9) 92 (40.9) 8 Influenza vaccines protect hajj pilgrims from influenza 1 (0.4) 12 (5.3) 26 (11.6 less than half of the respondents reported practicing receiving a flu vaccine. more than half of the respondents reported practicing receiving a flu vaccine. the correlation revealed significant negative linear correlations between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.232, p = 0.378) and attitude and practice (r = 0.134, p = 0.045) the result reaffirms a weak correlation between knowledge, attitude, and practice with respiratory tract infections KAP scores. most of the respondents were of malay ethnicity 223 (99.1) and there were 151 (67.1) females. students 17 (7.6) Highest level of education Bachelor 78 (34.7) Diploma 37 (16.4) Master 18 (8.0) PhD 8 (3.6) Secondary school 80 (5.6) Primary school 4 (1.8) History of vaccination Influenza (flu) vaccine 56 (24.9) Pneumococcal vaccine 62 (27.6) Presence of Co-morbidities Chronic lung disease 5 (2.2) Neuromuscular disease 17 (7.6) Allrgic rhinitis 12 (5.3) Diabetes 31 (13.8) Hypertension 55 ( most participants knew RTIs could be prevented by following a healthy diet (89.8%), receiving vaccinations (83.1%), washing hands with hand sanitizers (87.1%) and wearing a face mask (90.7%). but covering the nose with hands as a protective measure was known by only 32.0% of the participants. a cloth face mask is as effective as a two-ply surgical face mask 51 (22.7) 174 (77.3) K9 If I am not sick, the used face mask can be stored in a bag for later use 172 (76.4) 53 (23.6) 3.3. only 5.8% and 1.3% of participants strongly disagreed and strongly disagreed with the opinion of being opposed to. questions Strongly Agree Not Sure Disagree Strongly Disagree 1 Since the bird flu, SARS, MERS-COV, and H1N1 crises are over, I no longer need to worry about contracting flu-like illnesses.
