{"summary": "large and dense social groups are a typical but not exclusive feature of certain Old World fruit bat species. the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum is one of the most widely distributed bat species with a considerable capability to adapt to anthropogenically modified habitats. isolation study in a large colony of E. helvum in Kumasi, Ghana. migratory animals roost each year from October to April. parturition takes place from January to March. cell suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g. 200 l of cleared suspension was used as an inoculum for 5 104 E. helvum kidney and E. helvum lung. cells were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in DMEM. WAG amino acid substitution model with 1,000 parallel maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates. trees were visualized in FigTree from the BEAST 1.7.4 package (15) the supernatant of Kumasi rhabdovirus (KRV)-infected Vero cells was concentrated on a 36% saccharose cushion at 28,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 4 h. the supernatant was concentrated on a 36% saccharose cushion at 28,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 4 h. RNA extracts were prepared for 454 sequencing as described previously (1). reads were assembled using the Newbler software (Roche) resulting contigs were aligned against the nonredundant NCBI database with the blastn, blastx, and tblastx algorithms. sequence was confirmed by long-range reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and resequencing using Sanger technique with virus-specific primers. sera from bats, livestock animals, and humans were tested with a KRV-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay. sera were diluted 1:40 prior to incubation, followed by donkey anti-goat cyanin 2 (Cy2)-labeled Ig. dilutions mixed with 23 PFU of virus per well and incubated for 1 h. cells were washed with 1 PBS before addition of 100 l of serum/virus dilution. cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde, and the cell layer was stained with crystal violet. supernatants and cells were collected at 0, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR were done as described above. supernatants were diluted in OptiPRO serum-free medium. all sera were collected in EDTA Monovettes. samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for several hours before separation. Virus isolation was stopped after four passages if no cytopathic effect occurred. Phylogeny of dimarhabdoviruses was done with MrBayes 3.1 (14) also using the WAG amino acid substitution model with 1,000 parallel maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates. trees were visualized in FigTree from the BEAST 1.7.4 package (15). URV, Durham virus (FJ952155); IHNV, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (NC001652); KCV, Kern Canyon virus (NC017714); KRV, Kumasi rhabdovirus (KJ179955); LNYV, lettuce necrotic yellows virus (NC007642); MSPV, Malpais spring virus (KC412247); MEBV, Mount Elgon bat virus (DQ457103 RNA was extracted using a viral RNA kit, omitting the included carrier RNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA extracts were prepared for 454 sequencing as described previously (1). real-time RT-PCRs were done in 25 l using the SuperscriptIII OneStep RT-PCR kit. sera from bats, livestock animals, and humans were tested with a KRV-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay. anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 488 Ig (Dianova) (each conjugate used at 1:200) slides were analyzed and pictures taken with a motic fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) all sera were tested in duplicates in 2-fold dilution series ranging from 1:10 to 1:320. supernatants and cells were collected at 0, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection for RNA extraction and virus titration. supernatants were diluted in OptiPRO serum-free medium, cells were washed with 1 PBS, and 200 l of each dilution was applied on cells. cells were blind passaged and monitored daily for CPE. the supernatant was transferred to vero cells, causing a CPE. an electron micrograph of infected cells revealed particles with bullet-shaped morphology characteristic of rhabdoviruses. KRV was inoculated with an MOI of 0.001 on African green monkey kidney interferon-incompetent (Vero) and -competent (MA104) cells, human lung carcinoma cells (A549), and E. helvum kidney (EidNi) and lung (EidLu) cells. the highest titers were reached in primate cell lines, followed by the human cell line and bat cell lines. transcription initiation sequence (AACGAGA) and transcription termination sequence (CAUG[A]7) are highly conserved with the exception of gene 2, whose termination sequence is CUGG[A]7. gene 1 encodes a putative 436-aa protein (47.95 kDa), gene 3 encodes a 231-aa protein (23.81 kDa), gene 4 encodes a 561-aa protein (62.02 kDa) and gene 5 phylogenetic relationship of the L protein and the nucleocapsid protein of KRV was confirmed in a tree of the N gene. analysis was performed using Whelan and Goldman + Freq. model. phylogenetic tree of full nucleocapsid protein based on amino acid sequences.

KRV was detected in 25 (5.1%) of 487 available spleen samples. in five animals, viral RNA was also detected in other organs. spleens had the highest RNA concentrations. a minus sign is used for samples with viral concentration under the limit of detection. NA, no sample available. the mean viral concentration was 2.76 105 viral RNA copies per gram of tissue. no samples were available for July, August, or September. the rate of detection of KRV was significantly higher for older juveniles. of 476 Eidolon sera available for the investigation, 55 (11.5%) showed clear reactivity in IFA, with a large granular, cytoplasmic fluorescence pattern. Neutralizing antibodies were present in 33 sera (6.4%) in the range of 1:10 to 1:360 and were detected in all seasons. blood samples were taken from cattle, sheep, goat, and swine from Kumasi. none of 106 cattle, 105 sheep, or 124 goat sera tested reacted with KRV. two samples had 50% plaque reduction at a dilution of 1:20. representative IFA results for positive and negative swine sera shown in Fig. 4. all samples were from citizens of Kumasi. rhabdovirus was tentatively named Kumasi rhabdovirus (KRV) after its place of primary isolation at the Kumasi Collaborative Centre for Research in Tropical Medicine. cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1 and incubated for 2 days. the top row shows CPE-positive cells, while bottom row shows the negative control. the highest titers were reached in primate, human, and bat cell lines. KRV replicated in all tested cell lines with similar growth kinetics. production of infectious viral particles and viral RNA copy numbers correlated well. gene 1 (putative N) encodes a putative 436-aa protein (47.95 kDa), gene 3 (putative M) encodes a 231-aa protein (23.81 kDa), gene 4 (putative G) encodes a 561-aa protein (62.02 kDa), and gene 5 (putative L) encodes a 2,142-aa protein (241.55 kDa). phylogenetic comparison the dimarhabdovirus supergroup comprises a number of viruses for which only short sequence fragments of the nucleoprotein gene (N) are known. a separate phylogeny was calculated for partial N sequences based on an alignment focused only on viruses from the dimarhabdovirus supergroup. 69.9 42.9 52.8 52.5 42.1 44.0 PRV 41.7 66.7 69.4 71.3 44.0 45.5 45.7 41.0 41.7 46.9 TUPV 39.7 55.6 52.8 63.2 41.2 41.8 41.5 38.5 39.0 40.5 40.3 WONV 38.9 61.1 58.3 61.0 40.8 41.4 42.1 42.3 43.8 42.8 41.8 41.3 N gene KRV MEBVd 65.0 ORVd 59.2 V KOTV PFRV PRV TUPV WONV G gene KRV NISV 25.7 VSINV 21.3 22.0 CHPV 21.9 24.1 40.6 BEFV 20.5 19.0 18.8 20.2 KOTV 19.5 17.9 22.2 19.8 31.8 PFRV 20.2 19.8 33.6 31.7 18.8 19.5 PRV 20.2 21.5 23.3 23.7 17.9 19.1 23.4 TUPV 20.2 21.4 19.3 20.6 15.6 16.9 19. KRV was detected in 25 (5.1%) of 487 available spleen samples. viral RNA concentrations in spleen samples were determined by real-time RT-PCR. in five animals, viral RNA was also detected in other organs. a minus sign is used for samples with viral concentration under the limit of detection. the mean viral concentration was 2.76 105 viral RNA copies per gram of tissue. no samples were available for July, August, or September. rhabdoviruses are transmitted by and maintained in arthropod vectors. 1,240 female mosquitoes were sampled with CDC Light and BG Sentinel chemoattractant traps. no further sample containing KRV viral RNA was found beyond those listed in Table 3. there was no significant difference in gender (2 = 1.3; P = 0.26) or age (2 = 0.03; P = 0.87) distribution of neutralizing-antibody findings. examples of seropositive and -negative E. helvum, swine, and human sera were shown. Detection was done with goat anti-bat immunoglobulin (Ig) followed by donkey anti-goat Ig labeled with cyanin 2 (Cy2), goat anti- total number of samples tested, number and percentage of spleens testing positive with specific real-time RT-PCR, and number and percentage of sera with neutralizing antibodies. for months in which KRV was not detected, a minus sign is used. six sera showed reactivity by indirect immunofluorescence. only 1 of the 6 IFA-positive human sera had neutralizing antibodies. dimarhabdovirus group constitutes a large phylogenetic clade of viruses whose genetic diversity exceeds that of rhabdovirus genus Lyssavirus. if the KRV-related viruses form an independent taxonomic unit within the proposed new genus remains to be shown upon further studies of functional virus properties and epidemiology. we present essential cell culture methodology including bat-specific cultures in which further KRV-related viruses may be culturable. cross-neutralization among rhabdoviruses is untypical but possible. rhabdoviruses share amino acid identities for protein sequences encoded by their structural G and N genes of 56% and 67% respectively. serological signs of past infection were seen in up to 11.5% of all individuals (6.4% based on neutralization assay) rhabdovirus RNA was recently detected in bat-specific hematophagous ectoparasites, which we have not studied in this investigation. study site from february to April, preceding the increase of KRV detection in males and females. the accumulation of susceptible hosts during the breeding season can increase virus amplification and spillover in the colony (36). this factor might also contribute to an increased rate of arthropod-borne transmission. e can be considered sufficiently omnivorous to occasionally feed on dead bats. direct acquisition by contact with bat blood or tissue is compatible with our serological results for humans."}
