{"summary": "recent outbreaks suggest that Zika virus is mainly spread all over tropical and sub-tropical counties worldwide. there is no treatment or preventive vaccine to manage the consequences of Zika virus infection. the impact of the Zika outbreak may affect healthcare professionals. ka-affected areas, local conditions conducive to transmission, and limited health resources have been reported in Southeast Asian countries. the study was conducted among private healthcare professionals in Malaysia between June 2017 and December 2017. the sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimation of unknown population proportion. the minimum sample size required for each category was 78 general practitioners, 172 community pharmacists, and 145 nurses. foreign health care professionals, public, healthcare professionals of Malaysia, and those who were unable to communicate were excluded. way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significant differences of each variable between the groups. the threshold for statistical significance was p 0.05. 2.3. Ethics The study was approved by the International Medical University Research and Ethics Joint Committee. questionnaire was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals\u2019 preparedness and perceived response if there was a Zika outbreak. the questionnaire was piloted on 20 private healthcare professionals from four states (five from each state mentioned above) in Malaysia. no modifications were required following the evaluation. n % Age in years 20\u201330 96 22.74 31\u201340 188 44.54 41\u201360 138 32.54 Gender Male 203 48.10 Female 219 51.89 Profession General practitioner 82 19.43 Community pharmacist 188 44.54 Nurse 152 36.01 Ethnicity Malay 143 33.88 Chinese 167 39.57 Indian 112 26.54 Experience in years Up to 5 years 72 17.06 6\u201310 years 212 50.23 More than 10 years the general practitioners in this study considered themselves prepared for the management of Zika virus with the highest mean score (0.72 0.27) p = 0.002.
