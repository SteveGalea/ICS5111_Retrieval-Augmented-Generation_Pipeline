{"summary": "leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by intracellular parasites of the genus Leishmania and transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. most of the world's cases of VL are caused by leishmania donovani, which is endemic to south Asia, East Africa, and parts of the Middle East. the hydrolase has been detected in both promastigote and amastigote forms of L. donovani. previous studies have already shown recognition of LdNH36 from sera of patients with VL suggesting LdNH36 has inherent antigenic properties desirable for such a vaccine. the eukaryote P. pastoris also provides a more consistent expression platform in terms of folding and post-translational modifications with the native parasite-expressed LdNH36. this concern can be mitigated using genetic engineering to modify putative N-glycosylation sites via asparagine (N)-to-glutamine (Q) mutations. we engineered N-linked glycosylation sites on a P. pastoris-expressed LdNH36 recombinant protein antigen (LdNH36-dg2) and developed a scalable expression and purification process. we also conducted an animal study to evaluate the immune responses of LdNH36-dg2 when formulated in PLGA microparticles. mutating asparagines to glutamines resulted in a main band (Lane 3) without a HMW smear that migrated with an apparent molecular weight similar to the non-glycosylated E. coli expressed protein (Lane 4). a minor second band was observed migrating just above the main band for LdNH36-dg2. the 4 N-glycosylation site mutations (N!Q) are underlined. none of the mutation sites are present in F3 region (bold) the finalized process was performed on fermentation supernatant from two 10 L fermentations combined into one \u201c20 L\u201d purification batch. the process first utilized a TFF system with a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off cassette to buffer exchange the P. pastoris fermentation supernatant and decrease the pH. the 10 kDa MWCO showed no detectable loss of LdNH36-dg2. the main band by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A and B, lanes 5\u20138) migrated near 36 kDa. the main band by SDS-PAGE migrated near 36 kDa. LC-MSE peptide mapping was used as an orthogonal method to identify proteins present in the main 36 kDa and minor 64 kDa bands. the main 36 kDa band was composed of 100% LdNH36-dg2, which was consistent with both (anti-LdNH36 and anti-HCP) Western blot results. a PNGase F digestion was performed confirming that the top band observed in the reduced LdNH36-dg2 was a result of glycosylation. HPLC-SEC analysis in Fig. 6 showed improvement in purity from 7% to 90%. LdNH36-dg2 is present as one main peak at 132 kDa. the only difference is a conservative histidine to asparagine substitution at position 233, which forms a non-bonded contact via the conserved beta carbon (CB) only one main species was present, suggesting the removal of the higher and lower molecular weight species. vant was encapsulated using an oil-water emulsion method preceded by ion-pairing. empty PLGA microparticles were prepared by an oil-water emulsion method. serum antibodies of the subclasses IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b were generated. MP/LdNH36-dg2/CpG (20 g) vaccines had 14- to 45-fold higher mean titers than the soluble LdNH36-dg2/CpG (20 g) vaccine. the MP/LdNH36-dg2/CpG vaccine had 10-fold higher mean titers than the MP/LdNH36-dg2 vaccine (p 0.05) all groups vaccinated with microparticle-formulated LdNH36-dg2 had significantly higher mean titers than the non-soluble LdNH36-dg2/CpG group. for IgG2a subclass, there were no significant differences, regardless of the presence of microparticles or dosage of CpG. negative control groups had negligible antibodies against LdNH36-dg2 and LdNH36-E-WT (individual titers 103) all had negligible antibody responses against LdNH36-dg2 and LdNH36-E-WT (individual titers 103) anti-LdNH36 mouse sera generated against wild-type his-tagged, E. coli-expressed LdNH36 (lane 1). lane 4 shows different LdNH36 recombinant proteins expressed in P. pastoris. lane 4 shows the E. coli expressed protein, while lane 4 shows the E. coli expressed protein. sites are possible, which could lead to the slight increase in MW. the glutamine mutations also resulted in increased expression levels of LdNH36 compared to the serine mutations. the mutations were selected for further scale-up and immunogenicity testing. the dissolved oxygen (DO) trace and oxygen feed rate were monitored during the fermentation. both were consistent with healthy, metabolically active cells during pre- and post-induction phases. different induction times were evaluated, and the optimized duration of 72 h was selected. a 100 mM NaCl wash removed loosely bound contaminants. a 10 kDa MWCO was sufficient to recover 75% of LdNH36-dg2. the overall process produced 454 mg (37% overall recovery) of LdNH36-dg2. recovery(Overall) % Purity Fermentation Supernatant 1221 24 post-TFF 1221 100 100 24 Capto SP Pool 838 69 69 89 Concentrated Capto SP Pool 628 75 51 90 Sephacryl 200 Pool 454 72 37 97 Characterization of purified LdNH36-dg2 protein shows high purity and consistency with crystallized L. major nucleoside hydrolase Analysis. dNH36-dg2 was consistent with both (anti-LdNH36 and anti-HCP) Western blot results. the minor 64 kDa band was composed of 88% P. pastoris proteins and 12% LdNH36-dg2. the final purified product consisted of > 97% LdNH36-dg2. LC-SEC chromatographs of in-process samples shown with molecular weight standard in top chromatograph and corresponding MW of kDa. the predicted structure of the molecule as a tetramer is shown in (B) with the mutated glutamines highlighted in red. a predicted structural model of the tetramer is shown in Fig. 6B. pG The formulation of LdNH36-dg2 with CpG-containing microparticles resulted in microparticle mass yields of approximately 50%. loading levels were 21.6 \u2013 22.3 g LdNH36-dg2 protein (108 \u2013 112% efficiency) and 36.9 g CpG (92.2% efficiency) per mg of particles. there were no significant differences in IgG1 mean titers among the MP/LdNH36-dg2 groups. the differences between vaccinated groups were less pronounced. however, both IgG2 subtypes were consistently higher when the antigen was delivered with a microparticle and in the presence of CpG. BALB/c mice were vaccinated subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 3 with 40 g of LdNH36-dg2 protein plus varying amounts of CpG adjuvant (10, 20, 40, or 80 g) encapsulated in separate PLGA microparticles. vaccinated in 2 cohorts, separated by 2 d. NH36-dg2/CpG (80 g) vaccines had significant higher mean titers than the soluble LdNH36-dg2/CpG (20 g) vaccine (p 0.01), MP/LdNH36-dg2 vaccine (p 0.05) and MP/LdNH36-dg2/CpG (10 g) vaccine (p 0.05) there was no significant difference for the IgG2a subtype. IgG purified from mice injected with LdNH36-dg2 showed complete inhibition of hydrolase activity. a similar rate when purified IgG from sera of mice injected with nave mice is added to the reaction. discussion is being developed as a candidate recombinant antigen for a leishmaniasis vaccine. blot analysis suggested the presence of heterogeneous high-mannose type glycosylation, commonly seen in yeast systems. point mutations were introduced in 4 putative N-linked glycosylation sites to produce a recombinant protein with minimal glycosylation. this approach has been taken previously to reduce the heterogeneous glycosylation in recombinant protein vaccine candidates. the locations of the point mutations are outside of the F3 region of LdNH36. it was previously reported that intact carbohydrate epitopes were not required for recognition by anti-LdNH36 serum generated against LdNH36 purified directly from L. donovani. cGMP manufacturing campaign to support both phase 1 clinical trials and subsequent 5-y stability testing. the final purified LdNH36-dg2 consisted of > 97% LdNH36-dg2 with > 90% present as a consistent species. the purified LdNH36-dg2 had the expected native tetramer confirmation, as confirmed by HPLC-SEC and DLS. microparticle formulation shows a clear trend of increasing IgG2a and IgG2b titers with increasing CpG dosage in response to LdNH36-dg2 coated plates. but such a trend was not statistically significant in response to other reported studies in which adding CpG to protein antigen elicited higher IgG2a and IgG2b titers in BALB/c mice. a fermentation and purification process was developed and demonstrated up to a 20 L scale. a PLGA microparticle-based system with and without CpG adjuvant resulted in consistently higher IgG1 responses regardless of the presence of CpG adjuvant. the presence of CpG adjuvant did result in enhanced IgG2a and IgG2b levels (TH1-associated) dg exchanged the 4 asparagine residues for serine residues. the second mutant construct, LdNH36-dg2, exchanged the 4 asparagine residues for glutamine residues. the genetically engineered DNA sequence for all 3 constructs was codon optimized based on yeast codon preference. at an OD600 of 1.52, 450 mL of the seed culture was aseptically transferred into each vessel for a final OD600 value of 0.14. each vessel contained 5 L of sterile basal salt media (BSM) as per Stratton43 and 4.5 mL of PTM4 trace salts as per Stratton43 modified with 4.5 mL/L of 0.02% d-biotin. the 100% methanol included 12 mL/L PTM4 trace salts and 12 mL/L 0.02% biotin. the flow rate was maintained at 11 mL/L/h for 50 h until the oxygen demand went up. after 65 h of induction, the culture was harvested. two wash steps were performed using the dialysis buffer and 50 mM NaOAc pH 4.5, 100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) followed by an elution with 50 mM NaOAc pH 4.5, 360 mM NaCl. the concentrated Capto SP pool was divided into 11 batches (9 equal to 2.9% of the column volume (CV) and the remaining 2 at 2.3% and 2.0% of CV) Western blot analysis was performed by probing with anti-LdNH36 mouse polyclonal sera produced in-house from purified, E.coli expressed, wild-type his-tagged recombinant. blots using chemiluminescence detection were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and probed with a 1:3,000 dilution of primary antibody and a 1:1,000 dilution of secondary antibody.
