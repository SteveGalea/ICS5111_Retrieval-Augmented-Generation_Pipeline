{"summary": "training program is designed to simulate working conditions in a BSL-4 laboratory. applicants must demonstrate proficient work experience in lower containment levels. training includes bioseal doors, pressure sensors, a chemical shower room, air connection ports, biosafety cabinets. trainees complete required and elective modules and a specified number of mentored hours and entries into the laboratory to receive certification. pre-assessment helps us determine trainees\u2019 experience and identify their training needs. trainees provide information on group 1\u20134 pathogens they have previously handled, their experience in biosafety settings, animal species with which they have working experience, techniques with which they have experience. hands-on training is conducted through demonstration and practice using non-infectious materials at our training laboratory. trainees learn about the positive pressure suit, including how to inspect and wear the suit and use compressed air hoses. trainees learn emergency plans and proper techniques for entering and exiting the BSL-4 laboratory. the assigned mentor evaluates the trainee\u2019s performance, advises on safe and secure operations, and records areas in which the trainee needs further instruction or practice. the mentor then makes recommendations on whether the trainee is prepared for independent access to laboratory facilities. the trainee also takes an examination targeting their user category, manger, operations and maintenance, or researcher. the classroom-based theoretical coursework consists of 14 topics with 45 minutes of lectures and discussions per topic (Appendix) trainees must pass an examination with a score >90% before proceeding to the hands-on courses in our training laboratory. trainees who will work at the BSL-4 laboratory must complete a specified number of hours and entries into the laboratory in mentored on-the-job training (Appendix). trainees perform specific tasks, such as routine inspection and BSC testing, moving equipment, setting up BSCs before conducting experiments, disinfecting surfaces and removing generated waste, centrifugation, virus propagation and storage, plaque assays, inoculation. four staff members visited the P4 Jean M\u00e9rieux-Inserm Laboratory in Lyon, France; 2 visited galveston National Laboratory, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas, USA; and 1 visited the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia for training and certification on BSL-4 laboratory operations, maintenance, and scientific or support work. the theoretical coursework is designed to help trainees understand the features of the BSL-4 laboratory. China intends to build 5\u20137 high-containment laboratories by 2025 (9. our BSL-4 laboratory worker training system is the starting point for developing national norms for high-containment laboratory training."}
