{"summary": "the etiological backgrounds of these infections remain unconfirmed in most clinical cases. the aim of this study was to estimate prevalence of human coronavirus infections in a series of children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease in a one-year period in Slovenia. s, and less commonly, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) were found to be responsible for the common cold syndrome and were the cause of only mild upper respiratory tract infections. the role of HCoV in human gastrointestinal infections also awaits more detailed exploration. 233 (26%) respiratory specimens were collected from 149 children. equine herpesvirus 1 and equine arteritis virus isolates were included in the nucleic acid extraction as internal controls. RT\u2013PCR assays performed as one-step reactions within a single tube and a final volume of 20 L, containing 5 L of RNA and additional 6 mM MgSO4. all samples that were positive in the coronavirus screening assay were analyzed with a subtype-specific assay in which all the coronavirus species were detected separately. study population From June 2007 to May 2008, 897 respiratory specimens from 741 pediatric patients hospitalized at the University Children\u2019s Hospital in Ljubljana with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) were sent to the laboratory of the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana. each of the 664 samples represented a different hospitalization event, except for one child. total nucleic acids were isolated from 190 L of each respiratory specimen. an additional 5 L of equine herpesvirus 1 and equine arteritis virus isolates were included in the nucleic acid extraction as internal controls. all samples that were positive in the coronavirus screening assay were analyzed with a subtype-specific assay. all the specimens were also subsequently tested with real-time RT\u2013PCR for the presence of hRV [12], hMPV [13], and HBoV [14] using previously published assays. 664 specimens were collected from 592 children under six years of age with ARTI. median age was 17.7 months. female: male ratio was 1:1.3 (256/592; 43% females) HCoV infections were detected in winter (22/40, 55%) and spring (10/40, 25%), whereas 6/40 (15%) positive samples were collected in autumn and only 2/40 (5%) in summer. the association between HCoV positivity and seasonality was statistically significant (P 0.001) the estimated shape of the association is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Estimated association between age and HCoV viral load (Ct) the majority (70.3%) of HCoV-positive children were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs: bronchiolitis 56.7%, pneumonia 13.5%, bronchitis 5.4%, and recurrent wheezing 8.1%) 59 14.9 Recurrent wheezing 3 8.1 57 14.4 Asthma 2 8.7 22 5.6 Otitis media 1 2.7 14 3.5 Recurrent breathing/respiration difficulties 6 16.2 106 26.8 LRTIs 26 70.3 373 94.4 Key: HCoV, human coronavirus; LRTIs, lower respiratory tract infections. the differences in the clinical features of the HCoV-positive and HCoV-negative children were very similar HCoV negative vs HCoV positive with monoinfection (n = 26 vs 11) OR 95% CI P OR 95% CI P Specific symptoms Fever 0.76 0.35,1.67 0.49 0.37 0.07,1.96 0.24 0.37 0.09,1.51 0.17 Oxygen support required 2.46 1.18, 5.17 0.02 0.63 0.99,58.61 0.01 Cough 2.03 0.93, 4.41 0.07 8.75 1.41,54.37 0. an underlying medical condition was present in 11/37 (29.7%) HCoV infected patients. four children with underlying disease carried HCoV as a single pathogen. Species 229E was more likely to be detected as a single infection than were the other viruses. the most common virus detected was hRV (37.6%), followed by HBoV (20.9%) and hMPV (11.3%). most HCoV infections were detected in winter (22/40, 55%) and spring (10/40, 25%), whereas 6/40 (15%) positive samples were collected in autumn and only 2/40 (5%) in summer. on average, children with HCoV infections were older than those negative for HCoV. infection with HCoV and age were not significantly associated. however, age was associated with the estimated quantity of HCoV viral nucleic acids present (measured as Ct) the association was nonlinear (P 0.001) and the highest estimated viral load (lowest Ct) was detected in children around 10 months old. % or range Hospitalized 37 100 395 100 Median length of stay (range) 4 (2\u201317) 4 (1\u201320) Fever 14 37.8 112 28 Oxygen support required 17 45.9 280 70.9 Median duration of oxygen support 3 (2\u201314) 3 (1\u201313) Cough 23 62.2 311 78.7 Rhinorrhea 26 70.3 233 59 Conjunctivitis 1 2.7 16 4 Dyspnea 16 43.2 342 children with HCoV and coinfections had URTIs significantly more frequently than HCoV-negative children. the difference was statistically significant (P 0.001) (4/10 = 40% among those with HCoV monoinfections, 6/26 = 23% among those with HCoV coinfections, and 18/373 = 5% among the HCoV-negative children) LRTI vs URTI 7.61 2.97,19.54 0.001 2.62 0.44,15.54 0.29 15.72 3.26,75.81 0.001 Bronchiolitis 5.48 2.50,11.99 0.001 5.72 0.96,33.94 0.05 19.58 4.03,95.12 0.001 Key: odds ratios and 95% CIs were derived from univariate logistic regression models. coronavirus RNA was detected in 6% of respiratory samples from hospitalized children with ARTI. this prevalence was lower than we have found previously [8]. the majority of positive samples contained the HKU1 (52.5%) and the other coronavirus species were detected less frequently. HCoV was most often detected in winter and spring (80%). small number of cases and high number of HCoV coinfections with other respiratory viruses limited our ability to determine whether specific clinical signs or symptoms were associated with coronavirus infections. children infected with HCoV required significantly less oxygen support, and had less cough, dyspnea, wheezing, LRTI, and bronchiolitis. all HCoV-positive children included in our study were hospitalized with ARTI. 70.3% had LRTIs and 29.7% had URTIs. single infections with HCoV were more often detected in children with an underlying medical condition than in previously healthy children. tracheal aspirates or BAL samples were collected from severly affected children. all samples originated from hospitalized patients and that can be considered as source of selection bias. the authors declare that they have no competing interests.
