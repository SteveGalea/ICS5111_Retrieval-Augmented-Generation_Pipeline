{"summary": "the first outbreak of Zika detected in the Americas occurred in 2015, with a spike in suspected congenital malformations and other neurological complications. by august 3, 2017, there were approximately 217,000 confirmed Zika cases, and about 3,400 cases of associated congenital Zika syndrome. in a non-systematic, rapid desk review of SBC messages 1 year after the USAID Zika response began, we identified more than 30 variants of prevention behaviors that were being promoted. the prevention messages for these behaviors were not consistently presented, lacked cohesion in their packaging, and offered little specificity regarding how the behavior should be implemented to effectively reduce Zika infection and transmission. research could be leveraged because transmission dynamics for Zika were similar to other arboviruses and sexually transmitted infections. preventive behaviors targeting the vector (the Aedes aegypti mosquito) and practices to reduce sexual transmission had already been identified in the literature. a team of experts in SBC programming and vector control was enlisted to categorize and refine the behaviors. all of the behaviors were first grouped together by behavior to create a condensed version of about 15 behaviors. the list was distilled to 7 key behaviors. Efficacy is highest in areas where there is strong community engagement. covering long-term water storage containers has moderate potential efficacy in reducing breeding sites. the behavior had only been implemented in a geographically limited pilot stage intervention (e.g., larvivorous fish in water storage containers) the behavior was not supported by USAID (i.e., bed nets are not considered effective for Zika because of the vector behavior) or because it was not feasible within the scope of the program. vivorous fish to water storage containers is still in the pilot phase. the behavior is outside the locus of household control. there is limited literature on the efficacy of this intervention. there is limited literature on the efficacy of this intervention. literature on malaria was excluded because it is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, not Aedes, calling for different interventions. literature on malaria was excluded because it is transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes, not Aedes. a third criterion was developed to assess whether the behavior was easy to do and amenable to change to consider the contextual realities of how behaviors were being promoted and adopted. the prioritization process took place over 7 months between October 2017 and April 2018. more than 30 variants of behaviors and messages were identified and narrowed down to 7. a consensus-building approach was implemented at meetings of the USAID Partners Zika SBC Technical Working Group. literature on malaria was excluded because it is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, not Aedes, calling for different interventions. literature on malaria was excluded because it is transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes, not Aedes. a third criterion was developed to assess whether the behavior was easy to do and amenable to change to consider the contextual realities of how behaviors were being promoted and adopted. a consensus-building approach was implemented at meetings of the USAID Partners Zika SBC Technical Working Group and through consultations with technical experts. two of the final 7 behaviors were considered enabling behaviors and recommended but not included in the evidence review. five behaviors were explored in a full literature review. more than 30 behaviors and messages were narrowed down to 7 after reaching consensus within the Zika SBC Technical Working Group. the findings and conclusions for Zika SBC programming drawn from this process are presented below for each of the 5 preventive behaviors reviewed. condoms are highly efficacious and important during pregnancy to prevent congenital Zika syndrome. condom use is the only behavior that can prevent sexual transmission of Zika to sexually active women who may become pregnant or already are pregnant. condoms are widely available in pharmacies and health centers in LAC. access may be limited for women of low income. the targeting of breeding sites should depend on how productive they are. the targeting of breeding sites should depend on how productive they are. this behavior requires weekly action, based on the life cycle of Aedes mosquitoes. the frequency of removing lids is low34 and relatively feasible, assuming the lids are used correctly. long-term water storage containers coupled with correct use of tight-fitting, long-lasting lids may enable this behavior to have moderate potential efficacy in reducing Aedes breeding sites. the untadita method was tested in a randomized controlled trial. a specific bleach and non-ammonia detergent mixture is applied to container walls that are then scrubbed with a brush and rinsed out after 10 minutes. there have been concerns about potential toxicity of mixing non-recommended types of detergent with chlorine. the results of the literature review and the consultative process discussed in this article helped to identify behaviors with the greatest promise for preventing the acquisition and transmission of Zika. a critical part of this process was the consensus-building process with partners, ensuring input from those working on the ground. both documents guide prevention messages and prioritize calls to action. the documents will be available to the public via an interactive digital platform. partners working on dengue and chikungunya can use it. application of mosquito repellent is highly efficacious in preventing mosquito bites. women intending to become pregnant should also consider using repellent. using each product as directed is highly effective in preventing mosquito bites. condoms are highly efficacious and important during pregnancy to prevent congenital Zika syndrome. condom use is the only behavior that can prevent sexual transmission of Zika to sexually active women who may become pregnant or already are pregnant. Efficacy is highest in areas with strong community engagement, including active mosquito searches in homes and communities and awareness of the mosquito life cycle. ongoing community clean-up campaigns to remove unintentional standing water can reduce the adult mosquito population. long-term water storage containers with tight-fitting, long-lasting lids can prevent mosquito breeding sites. the focus of this behavior is on long-term storage items such as barrels or other large household water-storage containers used less than once per week. research is ongoing to determine what type of lids are the most effective. long-term water storage containers coupled with proper use of tight-fitting, long-lasting lids may enable this behavior to have moderate potential efficacy in reducing Aedes breeding sites. a lack of specific instruction has led to mixed results. 82% of surveyed households stored water and cited interruption of water services, poor water pressure, or cost-saving concerns. the second method, developed in the Negociaci\u00f3n de Pr\u00e1cticas Mejoradas trial,40 requires applying bleach to water-storage containers without being emptied if they are partially filled. the consensus-building process with partners helped to identify behaviors with the greatest promise for preventing the acquisition and transmission of Zika. partners requested focusing on behaviors that families and communities could do themselves (locus of control) the documents will be available to the public via an interactive digital platform. partners working on dengue and chikungunya can use it. the documents will be continually updated as new developments emerge. behavior prioritization process was developed to help USAID implementing partners identify focal behaviors for prevention to harmonize SBC programming efforts for greater impact. the process combined available evidence and a consensus-building approach to allow for adaptation based on local context. in the case of Zika, the disease was previously known in east Asia and the Pacific but was entirely new to LAC. other Aedes aegypti mosquito viruses were prevalent in the region, specifically dengue, which had been circulating in the region for more than 50 years, and chikungunya had emerged in 2013. data on best practices to prevent transmission could be gleaned from previous mosquito control and behavior change programming from LAC and southeast Asia. a consensus-building approach with USAID and its implementing partners was developed to categorize the relevant behaviors by criteria. the result of the process was a set of priority behaviors based on a combination of research evidence and context from partners with local knowledge. all 5 behaviors were prioritized by the USAID Zika response across 20 countries. process strives to incorporate evidence where it is available and was refined as the work developed. it can identify and select behaviors with the most potential to reduce transmission. process is flexible and based on consensus building with local and international stakeholders."}
