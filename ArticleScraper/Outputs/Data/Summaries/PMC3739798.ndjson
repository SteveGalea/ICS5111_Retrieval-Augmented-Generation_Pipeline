{"summary": "invasion by NIS impose enormous costs on agriculture, forestry, fisheries and water use, human health, utilities, buildings and natural areas. the spread of the NIS and the population levels can generate impacts to agriculture, human health and the environment. the estimation of NIS impacts is necessary to allow the generation of evidence-based risk management policies. 16 NIS were estimated to cause annual economic losses of US$12\u201331.1 billion (2011 international dollars) in Canada. 523 NIS inflict an annual cost of US$2.5 billion (2011 international dollars) in Great Britain [10]. despite lack of a broad knowledge about NIS in Southeast Asia, it is known that several high-impact NIS have already established and spread in the region with important ecological impacts. estimates of impacts of NIS on agricultural systems in southeast Asia. monetary values are expressed in 2011 international dollars. Purchasing power parity exchange rates were used to convert local currencies into international dollars. ylweeds, ylinsects, ylpathogens are the proportions of yield losses caused by weeds, insects, and pathogens respectively. Wi is the annual production value of crop i in Southeast Asia averaged over the period of 2000\u20132010 [26]. we estimated the annual total losses to crop production by non-native weeds, insects, and pathogens to be $21.6 billion (5th to 95th percentile: $18.06\u201323.05 billion) control costs associated with weeds, insects, and pathogens were only estimated for Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. in the Philippines the annual cost of this snail to rice agriculture was estimated at $731\u2013$2,064 million. we estimated the total annual loss caused by these snails to rice in Thailand and Vietnam as $74.8 million. this is based on the average gross production value of rice over the last 10 years. rice losses from 5\u201320% in pre-harvest and 5\u201310% in post-harvest are caused by rats. the cost of rodenticides and the loss incurred by non-native rats to rice production is estimated at $1.88 billion (5th and 95th percentile: $1.123\u20132.816 billion) this estimate does not include the costs to human health caused by the diseases carried by these two NIS rat species. since 1994, direct losses caused by the virus to the shrimp farming industry in Asia have been as high as $1 billion per annum. the outbreak resulted in the culling of 200 million poultry and a loss of over $12 billion to the poultry industry. the virus has also become zoonotic and has caused 268 fatalities from 376 known infections in Southeast Asia. the cost to fully vaccinate a person is estimated at $1.10 in Vietnam [49] while the cost of illness per episode of cholera in North Jakarta is $205.7 for hospitalized cases and $28.10 for outpatient cases [50]. estimating the total burden of cholera in Southeast Asia was not possible because this disease is highly underreported. SARS The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002\u201303 reduced Singapore\u2019s economic growth by 1% during the course of the epidemic, resulting in a total loss of $6 billion in GDP. in total, SARS cost these three Southeast Asian countries a total of $9.5 billion indirectly. 67 species are recorded as invasive in only a single ASEAN country. notably, 67 species are recorded as invasive in only a single ASEAN country. the feral pigeon (Columba livia) recorded as invasive only in Singapore. noxious invasive weeds, water hyacinth (E. crassipes), siam weed (C. odorata) and the giant sensitive plant (M. pigra) are among the world\u2019s worst invasive species. these three species are among the world\u2019s worst invasive species, with total budgets of $1.7 million, $2.3 million, and $2.9 million for each species. 2.2 million km2 of unforested areas in Southeast Asia resulting in an estimated cat population of 2.86 million. cats are known to be extreme generalist predators, that can prey on at least 248 species including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates. the feral pigeon (Columba livia) appears to have the widest distribution. it has colonised all 10 ASEAN countries, where it fouls structures and clogs drainages, raids crops, and transmitting 30 diseases to people. we estimated the damage from feral pigeons by assuming that the level of damage is similar to that in the USA. in Southeast Asia, up to 46% of cassava production is lost to weeds, 22% of maize production to insects, and 22% of potato production to pathogens. in each pest group, non-native species are not only high in number but also rated among the most damaging. we applied this estimation method to a database of 101 agricultural commodities produced in Southeast Asia including food crops such as cereals (e.g. maize, rice, wheat), vegetables (e.g. pea, spinach), fruits (e.g. mango, orange, coconut) and non-food crops (e.g. rubber, cotton) the information on yield losses and the proportion of those losses that are caused by each type of NIS were only available for some crops. phyCi calculated pesticide usage by averaging annual usage data in these three countries from 2006 to 2008. we estimated the annual pesticide costs imposed by exotic weeds, insects and pathogens in the three countries for which data were available. cost of $806\u2013$2,138 million per annum across the three countries is probably conservative because it does not include human health and environmental implications from the consumption of snails infected by disease-causing organisms. the golden apple snail causes a shift in the wetland ecosystem\u2019s state and function, thereby diminishing wetland ecosystem services across its invaded range. annual direct losses caused by foot and mouth disease to the Philippines are estimated at $92.7 million. annual control costs and loss from trade restrictions in Thailand is $16.7 million. since 1994, direct losses caused by the virus to the shrimp farming industry in Asia have been as high as $1 billion per annum. we assumed a uniform distribution based on the approximately 30-year interval between influenza pandemics over the last and present century. to represent the uncertainty inherent in estimating unpredictable outbreaks, we also considered half and double of this pandemic interval. our estimated annual impact based on this method was $369.7 million (5th and 95th percentile: $208\u2013696 million) ylweeds, ylinsects, ylpathogens are the proportions of yield losses caused by weeds, insects, and pathogens respectively. Wi is the annual production value of crop i in Southeast Asia averaged over the period of 2000\u20132010 [26] we estimated the annual total losses to crop production by non-native weeds, insects, and pathogens to be $21.6 billion (5th to 95th percentile: $18.06\u201323.05 billion) control costs associated with weeds, insects, and pathogens were, because of data paucity, only estimated for Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. a total estimated cost of $806\u2013$2,138 million per annum across the three countries is probably conservative. the golden apple snail causes a shift in the wetland ecosystem\u2019s state and function, thereby diminishing wetland ecosystem services across its invaded range. rice losses from 5\u201320% in pre-harvest and 5\u201310% in post-harvest are caused by rats. we assumed that the losses are shared equally by the considered rat species in Southeast Asia. the cost of rodenticides and the loss incurred by non-native rats to rice production is estimated at $1.88 billion. virus to shrimp farming industry in Asia has been as high as $1 billion per annum. half of the losses occur in Southeast Asia, i.e. $0.5 billion per year. virus has also become zoonotic and has caused 268 fatalities from 376 known infections in Southeast Asia. the cost to fully vaccinate a person is estimated at $1.10 in Vietnam [49] while the cost of illness per episode of cholera in North Jakarta is $205.7 for hospitalized cases and $28.10 for outpatient cases [50]. estimating the burden of cholera in Southeast Asia was not possible because this disease is highly underreported. SARS The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002\u201303 reduced Singapore\u2019s economic growth by 1% during the course of the epidemic, resulting in a total loss of $6 billion in GDP. a new epidemic of cholera [32] could impose a heavy burden on vaccination and treatment in Southeast Asia. cost of illness per episode of cholera in north Jakarta is $205.7 for hospitalized cases and $28.10 for outpatient cases. only 1% of cholera cases are reported, resulting in 1,009 cases reported to WHO from Southeast Asia in 2012. dengue is a serious disease resulting in an estimated 6,000 deaths in Southeast Asia in 2008 [45] in total, SARS cost these three Southeast Asian countries a total of $9.5 billion indirectly. the recent outbreak of a novel human coronavirus in the Middle East (HCoV-EMC) that resembles SARS [57] suggests other coronaviruses may have the potential to cause SARS-like epidemics. invasive in only a single ASEAN country, including the feral pigeon (Columba livia) recorded as invasive only in Singapore and the tree sparrow (Passer montanus) in the Philippines. number of reported environmental invasive species reported in 10 countries in Southeast Asia in the global Invasive Species Database. these three species are among the world\u2019s worst invasive species [62] and have been recorded in most Southeast Asian countries [59], [58], [59] where they have invaded natural, man-made (e.g., reservoirs), and agricultural systems. a series of economic impact assessments suggest substantial environmental and agricultural losses have been caused where these species are present. study of the bird trade in Singapore revealed that prayer birds can be priced at $1.40\u20133.60 each and songbirds at $21.40\u201371.30 [73]. the cost incurred by feral cats preying on birds amounts to $1.95 billion. the most studied urban invaders in the region are those in Singapore. we estimated an average loss of $146.5 million (5th and 95th percentiles: 83.8\u2013209.3 million) incurred by feral pigeons in Southeast Asia annually. we assumed that feral cats would be absent from natural forests due to competition and predation from other carnivores. cats prey more on native than non-native bird species. study of bird trade in Singapore revealed prayer birds can be priced at $1.40\u20133.60 each and songbirds at $21.40\u201371.30 [73] the most studied urban invaders in the region are those in Singapore. the feral pigeon (Columba livia) appears to have the widest distribution. it has colonised all 10 ASEAN countries, where it fouls structures and clogs drainages, raids crops, and transmitting 30 diseases to people. we estimated the damage from feral pigeons by assuming that the level of damage is similar to that in the USA. a shortage in market supply of the affected commodities due to NIS invasion could lead to higher prices and consequently a reduction in consumer welfare. human impacts such as social instability associated with epidemics, incremental costs embedded in state management of exotic species, the loss of aesthetic value due to biological invasions and indirect environmental and health costs could not be quantified. in absolute value, the estimated total annual cost of $33.2 billion to Southeast Asian countries is smaller than the $120 billion damage by NIS in the USA. however, in value relative to national GDP, the damage by NIS to all Southeast Asian economies (1.10\u20134.58%) except Singapore and Brunei is greater than in the USA, where it was 0.96% of its GDP. damage by the avian influenza virus to the poultry industry was calculated based on the mean loss proportional to the poultry population of the countries infected in the 2003\u20132004 epidemic. the poultry population was averaged over 10 years (2001\u20132010) [26]. data paucity prevented us from characterizing the behaviour of the demand and supply curves for each of the 101 agricultural products considered in all the countries. prices times quantities were used as proxies of the economic impacts. the introduction and establishment of the most impactful NIS in Southeast Asia are a direct consequence of intentional human activities. 151 invasive species have been reported as invasive in at least one country. 48% of these species are only listed as invasive in one of the references. this limitation might be caused by the heterogeneous nature of Southeast Asia."}
