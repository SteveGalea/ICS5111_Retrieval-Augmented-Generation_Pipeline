{"summary": "the advances in genome sequence technologies are making it more imperative to develop effective techniques for inferring protein functions from sequence information. the most widely used approach for protein function prediction is the annotation transfer, which is based on the assumption that protein functions are similar if their sequences are similar [4]\u2013[6]. the use of structural information is not limited to finding global fold similarity and distant evolutionary relationship. to date, there have been many methods for detecting potential ligand binding sites based on structural similarity of proteins [14], [16]\u2013[22]. meta-composite motifs are useful to elucidate the rich internal structures of biological processes compared to sets of homologous sequence clusters. we first generated all biological units as annotated in the PDBML [40] files, and then extracted 197,690 protein subunits which contained at least one ligand (non-polymer, protein or nucleic acid) binding sites. elementary motifs are solely based on the binding site structures. motifs were shared across non-homologous families with different folds. motifs included motifs for metal, mononucleotide or dinucleotide binding for non-polymer binding sites. the same elementary motif for FAD binding (labeled N2 in B) is shown in ball-and-stick representations (protein binding sites in orange, non-polymer binding sites in cyan) and with ligands in green (spacefill for non-polymers, cartoon for proteins) the protein figures were created using jV [75]. number of elementary motifs that comprise a composite motif ranges from 1 to 20. Approximately one third of the composite motifs consist of only one elementary motif. more than 90% of the composite motifs are composed of less than 5 elementary motifs. composite motif similarities widely vary for high sequence identities. the converse does not hold in general so it is not possible to take into account the structural diversity of binding sites and their combinations by using a representative set of proteins. composite motifs with more than one elementary motif (n1) are compared with those with at least one elementary motif (n0), the latter are the same as in A. the high correlation between composite motifs and UniProt functions may appear trivial. motifs, 2 composite motifs were actually found in the same dimeric complexes. each of them consisted of only 1 elementary motif shared between remotely homologous proteins. examples of composite motifs may modulate function specificity. Glycine oxidase (GO) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) GO from Bacillus subtilis (PDB 1RYI [47], chain A) and GlpD from Escherichia coli (PDB 2QCU [48], chain A) share the same elementary motif for binding the FAD cofactor and the same fold (NAD(P)-binding domain [45] despite the low sequence similar PGDH forms a homotetramer with one of its protein-protein interface located at its additional ACT domain. PGDH forms a homotetramer with one of its protein-protein interface located at its additional ACT domain. CtBP2 is involved in controlling the structure of the Golgi complex. a subunit of cytochrome interacts with all 3 other subunits. that of GOX interacts with only 2 out of 3 other subunits. cytochrome also has an elementary motif for heme binding. a meta-composite motif is defined as a set of all composite motifs (hexagons in magenta) associated with particular UniProt functions (green circles) each composite motifs are associated with elementary motifs for non-polymer (triangles in cyan), protein (rectangles in orange) or nucleic acid (diamonds in blue) binding sites. meta-composite motifs are defined by grouping together all composite motifs associated with particular functions. they are more suitable for analyzing, rather than predicting, protein functions in terms of interaction states of proteins. for example, we can identify a meta-composite motif for the UniProt keyword \u201cTranscription\u201d (Fig. 6A) and subsequently connect the constituent composite motifs (nodes) based on relations such as common elementary motifs or common sequences. a meta-composite motif (A) and a type-1 meta-sequence motif (B) for the UniProt biological process \u201cTranscription\u201d are examples of a meta-composite motif (a) and a type-1 meta-sequence motif (b) for the same keyword. the same trend is observed for a particular meta-composite motif obtained for the keyword \u201cTranscription\u201d. the classification of proteins allows us to inspect the organization of proteins involved in individual biological processes. the classification of proteins in terms of composite motifs allows us to inspect the organization of proteins involved in individual biological processes. structure comparisons of 410,254 non-polymer binding sites, 346,288 protein binding sites and 20,338 nucleic acid binding sites yielded 5,869, 7,678 and 398 clusters (with at least 10 members) of non-polymer, protein and nucleic acid binding sites. elementary motifs are solely based on binding site structures. combinations of 3 non-polymer binding elementary motifs (cyan triangles labeled N1, N2 and N3) and 3 protein binding elementary motif (orange rectangles labeled P1, P2 and P3) define 3 distinct composite motifs (hexagons in magenta labeled C1, C2 and C3) the set of elementary motifs contained in a protein subunit is called the composite motif of the subunit. in total, 5,738 composite motifs, each of which is shared by at least 10 subunits, were identified. a third of the composite motifs consist of only one elementary motif. 118 composite motifs were shared between close homologs on average. only three out of these 118 composite motifs consisted of more than one and at most two elementary motifs. if a composite motif consists of more than one elementary motif, it is most likely to comprise only homologous proteins. composite motifs with more than one elementary motif (n1) are compared with those with at least one elementary motif (n0), the latter are the same as in A. the function similarity persists even for low composite motif similarities. fraction of elementary motifs imply more function similarity compared to bare sequence or binding site similarities. this indicates that combinations of multiple elementary motifs may enhance accurate inference of specific protein functions. 15 composite motifs were found to be shared by completely different functions. GO and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) GO from Bacillus subtilis (PDB 1RYI [47], chain A) and GlpD from Escherichia coli (PDB 2QCU [48], chain A) share the same elementary motif for binding the FAD cofactor. despite the low sequence similarity (14% sequence identity), they share the same fold (FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain PGDH and C-terminal-binding protein 3 (CtBP3) PGDH from e. coli (PDB 1PSD [51], chain A, EC 1.1.1.95) and CtBP3 (also called CtBP1) from rat (PDB 1HKU [52], chain A, EC 1.1.1.-) share the same elementary motif for binding the NAD cofactor and the same folds (NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domain and Fla Factor VII heavy chain is in complex with its light chain counter part as well as with tissue factor, which shapes its functional form. -trypsin is not known to form a similar complex structure. the difference in their complex structures can be associated with the difference in their functions. GO forms a homotetramer and has 3 elementary motifs for protein binding. despite the low sequence similarity (14% sequence identity), they share the same fold. PGDH forms a homotetramer with one of its protein-protein interface located at its additional ACT domain. -trypsin and coagulation factor VII bovine -trypsin (PDB 1G3C [54], chain A, EC 3.4.21.4) and human coagulation factor VII heavy chain (PDB 1WQV [55], chain H, EC 3.4.21.21) are both serine proteases with 40% sequence identity. in these structures, they share the same elementary motif for protease inhibitors at the catalytic sites. cytochrome also has an elementary motif for heme binding in its additional heme-binding domain. such function is absent from GOX. composite motifs only represent snapshots of biological processes. a meta-composite motif is defined as a set of all composite motifs (hexagons in magenta) associated with particular UniProt functions (green circles) each composite motifs are associated with elementary motifs for non-polymer (triangles in cyan), protein (rectangles in orange), or nucleic acid (diamonds in blue) binding sites. a protein in one composite motif interacts with another protein in another (possibly the same) composite motif. an edge representing protein-protein interaction can be also drawn. in the case of composite motifs, nodes may be also characterized according to their constituent elementary motifs. type-1 meta-sequence motif (B) for the UniProt biological process \u201cTranscription\u201d. compared network characteristics of meta-composite motifs against those of meta-sequence motifs. the same trend is also observed for a particular meta-composite motif obtained for the keyword \u201cTranscription\u201d motifs or sequence clusters (denoted CM/SC), connected components (CC) and edges representing sharing of common elementary motifs (CEM) for non-polymer, protein and nucleic acid binding sites, common sequences (CS) and protein-protein interactions (PPI) the same counts for nodes and various edges, but only for the meta motifs for the keyword \u201cTranscription\u201d. the classification of binding site structures is effectively not very different from the traditional classification schemes. however, by combining the elementary motifs found in individual subunit structures solved under different experimental conditions, it becomes possible to specify a particular interaction state for a particular subunit. this is because the diversity of atomic structures is not negligible even for highly homologous or identical proteins. this limitation is inherent in any annotation transfer approaches. it is preferable to accumulate more structures in the PDB, not only those of completely novel folds, but also those of known folds but in new ligand-bound forms. 197,690 subunits in 79,826 biological units contained at least one ligand binding site. in total, 197,690 subunits in 79,826 biological units contained at least one ligand binding site. ligands include non-polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. GIRAF score is defined as (1) where and are the number of atoms of the binding sites and respectively, and is the number of aligned atom pairs. the weight for the aligned atom pairs is defined as (2) where is the distance between two atoms in a superimposed coordinate system and the cutoff distance is set to 2.5. clusters with less than 10 members were excluded in this study because structural similarity in small clusters may be coincidental. this is in contrast to the Gene Ontology annotations for the PDB. for each subunit, all the keywords annotated explicitly or implicitly were extracted except for those belonging to the Technical term, Disease, or Domain categories. 4,594 clusters with at least 10 members are referred to as type-2 sequence clusters. BLAST produces more than one alignment for a pair of sequences. the alignments were integrated into one alignment as long as they were mutually consistent. 197,690 subunits in 79,826 biological units contained at least one ligand binding site. ligands include non-polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. the nucleic acid ligands are those annotated as such in the PDBML [40] files. the cutoff value was chosen so that the largest cluster did not predominate all other clusters due to the \u201cphase transition\u201d of the similarity networks. the GIRAF score is defined as (1) where and are the number of atoms of the binding sites and respectively, and is the number of aligned atom pairs. the weight for the aligned atom pairs is defined as (2) where is the distance between two atoms in a superimposed coordinate system. a set of controlled vocabulary to describe the properties of proteins are organized in a hierarchical order. in most cases, these keywords are manually assigned by curators. this is in contrast to the Gene Ontology annotations for the PDB which are mostly automatically annotated. 4,594 clusters with at least 10 members are referred to as type-2 sequence clusters. BLAST produces more than one alignment for a pair of sequences. the alignments were integrated into one alignment as long as they were mutually consistent."}
