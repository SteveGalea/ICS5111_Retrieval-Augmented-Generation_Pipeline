{"summary": "IBV is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. it causes a clinical disease characterized by coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and watery eyes. the disease is associated with both quantity and quality deterioration of egg production. field safety and effectiveness of the newly developed IB-VAR2\u00ae vaccine followed by a classical IB-H120 vaccine were evaluated in day-old chicks under normal field circumstances. the classical IBV vaccine is a commercial live attenuated H120 strain (Nobilis IB H120; Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherland) the only difference in vaccination programs between farms 1 and 2 was the use of IB-VAR2\u00ae vaccine at day-old age, then a booster dose using IB-H120 at day 16 in farm 1 and IB-H120 at both ages in farm 2. thirty birds were bled each time and sera were collected from the vaccinated birds at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of life. Mortality was recorded daily and cumulative mortality was obtained. farm 1 was compared to farm 2 at the selling age in terms of feed total weight gain, conversion ratio, and cumulative mortality. the classical IBV vaccine is a commercial live attenuated H120 strain (Nobilis IB H120; Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherland) all the vaccines were given at the manufacturer\u2019s recommended doses. tracheal and kidney tissues samples from 10 randomly selected birds were subjected to RT-PCR for viral pathogen detection. if any clinical problem was noticed at any time point, collected samples were subjected to IBV RT-PCR and viral isolation. the HI test was carried out using IBV antigens (IB-H120 and IBV-VAR2) prepared at our laboratory as previously described by the OIE manual [15], using recent Egyptian strains as inactivated viruses. the HI test was carried out for AI-H5 and AI-H5 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1.7, while farm 2 yielded a total of 8150 kg with a FCR of 2.1 (Table 2). Item Farm 1 (IB Var2/H120) Farm 2 (H120/H120) Total no. in flock 7600 7000 Total no. of sold birds 6916 a 5460 a Cumulative mortality 9.0% 22.0% Total sold weight 12,250 b kg 8150 b kg Average weight 1771 c 1492 c FCR 1.7 d 2.1 log2 HI antibody titers increased to 9.9 0.3 log2 by two weeks post-vaccination. the log2 HI antibody titers increased to 9.9 0.3 log2 by two weeks post-vaccination. the immune responses against other vaccines showed that the IBD mean ELISA titers decreased from 2653 965 to 848 353 by two weeks of age. samples collected from both farms were subjected to virus isolation and IBV S1 gene partial sequencing. the results revealed that a wild-type virulent IBV variant 2 strain was implicated in this outbreak. the same virus strain was isolated from both farms.

IBD mean ELISA titers decreased from 2653 965 to 848 353 by two weeks of age. samples from both farms were subjected to virus isolation and IBV S1 gene partial sequencing. the results revealed that a wild-type virulent IBV variant 2 strain was implicated in this outbreak. the same virus strain was isolated from both farms. a new live attenuated vaccine was evaluated in a prime-boost IBV vaccination program in commercial broiler chicks under field conditions. the vaccine was tolerable in day-old commercial broiler chicks under field conditions with no adverse clinical manifestations through the study period. the IBV virus detection, isolation, and identification confirmed the exposure of the two farms to a wild-type variant II IBV strain. no adverse effect of the IB-VAR2 vaccine on any of the tested viruses\u2019 humoral immune responses was detected. the relatively low HI antibody titers of AI-H9 and AI-H5 recorded at two weeks of age are probably due to MDA decay. the vaccine does not interfere with the birds\u2019 immune response to both live and inactivated vaccines of other viral pathogens. the combination of ME VAC IB-VAR2\u00ae and live classical IBV vaccines confers a protective immune response."}
