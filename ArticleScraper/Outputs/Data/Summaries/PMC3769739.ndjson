{"summary": "astroviruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus of the Astroviridae family. the viral particles are small, non-enveloped, positive sense RNA viruses, 28 to 30nm in diameter, and have a star-like morphology. astroviruses are linked with enteric disease in humans and young animals such as calves, lambs, pigs, dogs, cats and minks. the TCoV was confirmed as being in the UK in 2001 (6). the virus has been demonstrated as worldwide distribution (7). molecular approaches seem to be more appropriated to direct detect viral RNA from clinical samples. the birds were submitted to necropsy and slices of bursa of Fabricius (BF; n=12), thymus (TH; n=10), spleen (SP; n=40), ileum-caeca region (n=20) were collected. a large growing scale under straight bio-security manners, presenting 10% of mortality in average were included on this study. RT-PCR was used to infect MA and Vero cells, at three times consecutively, which are not able to support TCoV neither TAstV-2 replication. the samples were used to infect MA and Vero cells, at three times consecutively, which are not able to support TCoV. a set of primers used were a combination of UTR11-/UTR41+ which are incriminated to produce a very sensitive RT-PCR (6). the simplex and multiplex RT-PCR applied in all samples was conducted according to Teixeira et al. (34) and Pantin-Jackwood et al. (24), respectively. a primary screening test to identify climatic characteristic significantly related to TAstV-2 and TCoV positive results was performed using 2-test. the accuracy of two conditionally independent tests in the absence of a gold standard was used. the birds were submitted to necropsy and slices of bursa of Fabricius (BF; n=12), thymus (TH; n=10), spleen (SP; n=40), ileum-caeca region (n=20) were collected. half of each organ was kept under -86oC as a source of original virus. the other half readily submitted to prepare the respective tissue suspension (34) TAstV-2 was not used as positive control in this study. other RNA virus, IBV (Infectious bronchitis virus) was included as negative control for TAstV-2 and positive control for TCoV. the samples were used to infect MA and Vero cells at three times consecutively. RT-PCRs are incriminated to produce a very sensitive RT-PCR. a total of 10 l of PCR products were electrophoresed at 100 V for 1 h in 1.5% agarose gel in 1 x Tris-borate EDTA buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet transluminator. independent tests in the absence of a gold standard were used (10). variables were performed using the odds ratios to quantify the association between climatic conditions (summer and winter) and positively results for TAstV-2 and TCoV from CS and faeces; from TAstV-2 and TCoV in tissues and sera; from TAstV-2 and TCoV RT-PCRs. the highest likelihood of infection for both viruses was found amongst faeces collected. 100% and 80% were positive for TAstV-2 and TCoV (p= 0.9417), respectively. multiplex RT-PCR TAstV-2 TCoV Samples MKPOL 3'UTR p-values OR CS 350a 70 200 40 0.7943 1.5 Faeces 400 80 150 30 0.7319 Sera 420 84 0 _ BF 12 100 0 _ SP 35 87,5 0 _ Ileum-caeca 90 90 100 100 100 1.9 a- Based on positive samples in comparison to the total samples analysed described on material simplex RT-PCRa Multipex RT-PCRb TAstV-2 TCoV TAstV-2 TCoV Summerc Winter Winter Winter Winter 2 p-values OR CS Positive 200d 250 10 190 300 50 100 100 100 0.87654 0.67 % 40 50 2 38 60 10 20 CS Negative 25e 25 100 200 100 50 80 220 0.67851 % 5 5 20 40 20 16 44 Faeces Positive 300 200 150 250 during winter temperature winter month > 20oC and rainy season during summer (October to March approximately) precipitation in rainy season varied from 40 to 270.3 mm/month. there was no rain at all during dry season (results not shown) positive results of viral RNA (TAstV-2 and TCoV) searched by simplex RT-PCR to amplify the TAstV-2 polymerase gene and TCoV 3\u2018UTR region. multiplex RT-PCR TAstV-2 TCoV Samples MKPOL 3'UTR p-values OR CS 450a 90 200 40 0.7917 1.9 Faeces 500 100 400 80 0.9417 Sera 350 70 RT-PCRs, CS, faeces and winter/summer results were compared. 10% of CS and 20% of faeces were positive at winter. 36% of CS and 20% of faeces showed an increase in same period. TCoV was less detectable, CS 50% and faeces 72%, in the winter. a simplex RT-PCR performed as described in material and methods section; b- Multiplex RT-PCR performed as described in material and methods section; c- Year average rainfall and humidity year 2006 250mm3 and 78% (summer); 0mm3 and 40% (winter); e- Negative results related to total samples analyzed described in material and methods section. 52% and 70% of TCoV and TAstV-2 were evidenced from turkeys using the simplex RT-PCR assay (1,9). the ileum-caeca junction was able to increase the chance of detect viral RNA compared to faeces. this is the first study reporting the applicability of multiplex RTPCR performed on different clinical material. recent work has demonstrated that genetic differences on TAstV-2 capsid gene do not promote any different enteric disease (26). TAstV-2 may affect the immune system by causing bursal lymphoid depletion, which can explain the positive results obtained from this tissue. clnicos foram caracterizados como intenso fluido intestinal e baixo crescimento em aves jovens, sendo o material coletado swabs cloacais, fezes, soros, bursa de Fabrcius, segmentos do intestino delgado, timo e ba\u00e7o. a t\u00e9cnica de multiplex RT-PCR demonstrou ser 3.98 vezes mais eficiente em promover resultados positivos nas fezes que nos swabs cloacais, durante a \u00e9poca de inverno. os maiores fatores de risco encontrados foram baixa umidade relativa associada a altas temperaturas, durante clnicos foram caracterizados como intenso fluido intestinal e baixo crescimento em aves jovens, sendo o material coletado swabs cloacais, fezes, soros, bursa de Fabrcius, segmentos do intestino delgado, timo e ba\u00e7o. a t\u00e9cnica de multiplex RT-PCR demonstrou ser 3.98 vezes mais eficiente em promover resultados positivos nas fezes que nos swabs cloacais.
