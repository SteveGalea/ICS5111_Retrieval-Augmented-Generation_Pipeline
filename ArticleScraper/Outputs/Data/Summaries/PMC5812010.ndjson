{"summary": "reporting is required for all patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of respiratory infections and a positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for MERS-CoV. a total of 1308 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported by the moH to the world health organization (WHO) from November 2012 to February 2016, a total of 1308 cases were reported by Saudi Arabia to WHO. d in intrauterine fetal demise, and 1 infant died 4 hours after emergency cesarean delivery. patient 1 was a 34-year-old woman (gravida 7, para 6) at 34 weeks gestation. patient 2 was a 32-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) at 38 weeks gestation. symptoms worsened after admission, and her chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. she delivered a healthy neonate vaginally on 10 September, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. the patient died on 24 November 2014 of severe refractory hypoxia and cardiac arrest. she was diagnosed with bronchopneumonia with a left lobar infiltrate. tests of a respiratory specimen collected that day confirmed MERS-CoV. physiologic changes occur during pregnancy to reduce inflammatory immune responses that otherwise might lead to fetal rejection. disease pathogenesis is also affected, secondary to reduced activity of natural killer cells, inflammatory macrophages, and helper T cells. the overall impact of MERS-CoV on maternal and birth outcomes requires further evaluation. additional data are needed to further define this apparent association. pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age infected with MERS-CoV should be considered."}
