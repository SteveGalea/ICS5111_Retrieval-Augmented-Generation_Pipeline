{"summary": "canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) belongs to coronavirus group 2 and is a causative agent of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) this virus emerged in the respiratory tracts of dogs suffering from severe respiratory disease (1). there are no complete genomic sequence data available publicly for CRCoV. to date, there are no complete genomic sequence data available publicly for CRCoV. nucleocapsid (N), and internal N protein (I) gene sequences of CRCoV and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCoV) and comparison with the sequences of the reference BCoV strain showed that CRCoV and BRCoV shared high homology to the reference BCoV strain. the transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) of CRCoV K37 occur in two forms. V belongs to the 2a subgroup, with HCoV, BCoV, BRCoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), pigeon herpes encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) of coronavirus group 2."}
