{"summary": "57 healthy asymptomatic people harbored primarily Streptococcus. 59 patients acutely infected with influenza, parainfluenza, rhino, respiratory syncytial, corona, adeno, or metapneumo viruses. principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of bacterial communities isolated from 57 healthy adults was performed using the weighted pairwise UniFrac distance matrix. the UniFrac distance represents the distance between 2 samples in terms of the microbial community structure. the average nucleotide identity (ANI) value indicating genome relatedness was calculated using the complete genome sequence of M. catarrhalis RH4 strain. the list of virulent genes was obtained from previous reports [31],[56]."}
