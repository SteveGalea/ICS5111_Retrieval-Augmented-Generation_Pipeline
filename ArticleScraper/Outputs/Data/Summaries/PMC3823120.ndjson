{"summary": "recognition of any intracellular or viral protein by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires an initial cytosolic proteolytic processing by proteasomes to peptide products. most peptides released from the proteasome into the cytosol are promptly degraded by cytosolic endopetidases and aminopeptidases to single amino acids. this explains the relatively subtle efficiency of antigen presentation by class I molecules. vaccination with an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen causes stronger immune responses compared to vaccination with an adenovirus vector expressing only the E7 protein. the adenovirus expresses an 18 kD protein, as expected, in contrast to the 70 kD band expressed by the CRT-E7 adenovirus. EL fusion protein has been distributed to the ER, we did immunofluorescent staining of cells infected with the different adenoviruses using antibodies against E7 protein and calnexin. previous studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of E7 is lost by fusion to calreticulin which sequesters E7 to the ER. HEK293 cells infected at a MOI of 5 with an adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL, Ad-CRT-E7 or LacZ were cultured over glass slides for 48 hrs. the cells were fixed and first incubated with rabbit anti-calnexin MAb or mouse anti-E7, and then with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse. three mice were immunized with adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL, CRT-E7 or LacZ (5 1010 VPs/mouse) groups were immunized by intraperitoneal injection with adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL, CRT-E7 or LacZ (5 1010 VPs/mouse) adenovirus expressing E7 did no protect the mice against tumour development. all the mice vaccinated with the adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL eliminated the tumour. this protective effect demonstrates that the SP and KDEL signals are enough to enhance the antitumour immune response. fusion of CRT also enhances the humoral response of antigens such as the receptor-binding domain (domain IV) of the protective antigen (PA[dIV] of Bacillus anthracis[17] and a SARS coronavirus antigen [18]. this work represents an important contribution for basic research and future clinical translation. genes were subcloned in pShuttle vector and then recombined with the adenoviral genome. infected cells were harvested and lysed, and the viral particles were purified using the ViraBind Adenovirus Purification kit. HEK293 cells infected at a MOI of 5with Ad-LacZ, Ad-CRT-E7 or Ad-SP-E7-KDEL were cultured over glassslides for 48 hrs. cells were washed in PBS, and fixed with amethanol:acetone solution for 10 min at \u201320 \u00b0C. after several washes with PBS, cells were incubatedwith AlexaFluor 488-conjugated Splenocytes from these animals wereharvested after 7 days and were stimulated with E7 CTLimmunodominant epitope RAHYNIVTF (amino acids 49\u201357) in24-well plates for 3 days."}
