{"summary": "most of Canada's 438 suspected and probable SARS cases were identified in Toronto. Hamilton and Toronto hospitals are otherwise similar in terms of size, workload, and organizational characteristics. the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of each hospital. participants were surveyed about changes since the SARS outbreak in healthcare work hours and the amount of face-to-face contact with patients in their work. survey B measured perception of stigma and interpersonal avoidance; adequacy of training, protection, and support; and job stress (6,10,26) Scales to measure perceptions about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience were used to measure perceptions of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience. the prevalence of high scores was determined with standard cutoff values. IES >26 (http://www.mardihorowitz.com), MBI-EE >27 (25), K10 >16 (http://www.crufad.unsw.edu.au). between-group differences in categorical variables were tested by 2. a 10-day cutoff for quarantine corresponds to the standard period of quarantine for SARS. most of Canada's 438 suspected and probable SARS cases were identified in Toronto. most of Canada's 438 suspected and probable SARS cases were identified in Toronto. the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of each hospital. a 6-question questionnaire surveyed whether or not they participated in the Impact of SARS Study. participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. the questionnaire measured exposure to SARS patients, age range, job type, years of healthcare experience. scales calculated as the mean of all items related to these constructs showed adequate internal reliability. Adaptive coping (problem-solving, seeking support, positive reappraisal) and maladaptive coping (escape-avoidance, self-blame, confrontative coping) regarding SARS were measured with the relevant subscales of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire. a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) items scored on a 6-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Statistical Analysis Central tendencies of parametric variables are described by mean and standard deviation; nonparametric variables are described by median and interquartile range. prevalence of high scores was determined with standard cutoff values. variables with a significance of p0.05 were entered. this analysis was performed for survey A and B participants. this item is the duration of perceived increased risk after the last SARS patient was discharged or died. 73.5% of participants were nurses (69.4% staff nurse, 3.1% manager or educator, 1.0% infection control practitioner) the next most prevalent job types were clerical staff (8.3%), physicians (2.9%), and respiratory therapists (2.3%). survey A and B participants did not differ significantly from participants who only completed survey A by sex, job type or city of employment. survey A and B participants were older (mean 45 standard deviation 9 years vs. 41 10 years, p0.001) and more experienced in healthcare work. adverse outcomes Toronto, n = 587, % Hamilton, n = 182, % p value High burnout (MBI-EE score >27) 30.4 19.2 0.003 Decreased work hours 8.6 2.2 0.003 Increased smoking, drinking alcohol, or other behavior that could interfere with work or relationships 21.0 8.1 0.001 Missed >4 work shifts because of stress or illness 21.6% 12.6% 0.007 *MBI-EE, Maslach Burnout Inventory; Characteristics Burnout Psychological distress Posttraumatic stress n Median Interquartile range p value Sex Male 82 18 9\u201329 14 12\u201319 10 2\u201319 Female 505 19 10\u201329 0.30 15 12\u201319 0.91 12 4\u201321 0.02 Job type Nurse 418 21 11\u201329 14 11\u201318 12 5\u201322 Other 169 14 8\u201327 0.002 15 12\u201320 0.16 10 2\u201319 0.1 Healthcare experience 10 y 205 21 12\u201330 16 12\u2013 149 19 11\u201329 0.43 15 12\u201318 0.78 10 4\u201322 0.44 Unprotected exposure to SARS patient No 502 18 9\u201328 15 11\u201319 11 4\u201321 Yes 85 24 13\u201332 0.012 16 13\u201322 0.08 13 6\u201322 0.38 In SARS patients' rooms >5 min, >5 times No 316 18 9\u201328 15 11\u201318 11 3\u201321 Yes 271 20 11\u201331 0.08 15 12\u201321 0.02 11 5\u201322 0. variable: burnout* Maladaptive coping 0.29 3.34 0.001 Perceived adequacy of training, protection and support \u20130.27 \u20133.10 0.002 Model R2 = 0.18, p0.001 Dependent variable: psychological distress Maladaptive coping 0.31 3.78 0.001 Years of healthcare experience \u20130.26 \u20133.28 0.001 Attachment anxiety 0.24 2.87 0.005 Model R2 = 0.31. a categorical analysis shows that long-term adverse outcomes in Toronto HCWs occurred at a prevalence 50%\u2013100% higher than in Hamilton HCWs. these outcomes may have a systemic impact, since SARS-affected HCWs reported reducing patient contact and hours of healthcare work as well as frequent sick absences. exposure to high-intensity and high-risk work settings and direct exposure to infected patients were not the primary determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. the extent of various forms of distress was increased in Toronto HCWs, irrespective of their degree of contact with SARS patients. both systemic and personal variables were associated with persistent distress. a review of interventions to modify coping style is beyond scope of this paper. the results suggest supportive interventions may be especially important for HCWs with fewer years of experience. attachment anxiety is a common, relatively enduring interpersonal style within close relationships. despite a response rate of 39%, representativeness survey suggests that HCWs who participated were similar to nonparticipants. a further limitation is that self-reports of SARS experiences do not provide an objective evaluation of actual differences in the training, protection or support that HCWs received."}
