{"summary": "tumor protein p53 is known as the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d as it plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing mutation in the genome. p53 acts as a key player in restricting tumor cell invasion that includes the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis. codon usage patterns have been interpreted for diverse reasons. many genomic factors are associated with CUB in different organisms. mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment play a major role in the codon usage pattern of organisms. literature suggested that a gene can be epitomized by the sequence of its amino acid but also by its codon usage patterns shaped by the balance between mutational bias and natural selection. the present study was undertaken in order to perform a comparative analysis of codon bias and compositional dynamics of codon usage patterns in TP53 gene across eight different mammalian species. -ending codons i.e. TCG for serine and CTG for leucine amino acid showed strong positive correlation (p0.01) with GC3s. codon ATA encoding isoleucine amino acid was not favored by natural selection in TP53 genes across mammalian species during the course of evolution. the mean values of C3 and G3 were the highest followed by T3 and A3. the average percentage of GC contents at the first and second codon positions (GC12) was found in the range of 52.6% to 54.9% with a mean value of 53.4% and a standard deviation (SD = 0.008) 58.7 57.4 49.4 69.3 30.7 53.4 4 266 229 300 351 55 78 115 134 43.2 56.8 56.5 48.7 65.2 34.8 52.6 5 264 204 321 384 57 58 125 151 39.9 60.1 59.8 49.9 70.6 29.4 54.9 6 289 244 302 341 73 89 112 118 45.3 54.7 57.4 48.0 the overall RSCU values in the selected coding sequences of TP53 gene revealed that 25 codons were most frequently used among the 59 codons. the most predominantly used codons were G/C\u2014ending compared to A/T\u2014ending. the highest RSCU value was found for the codon CTG for leucine amino acid in all TP53 genes across mammalian species.

GC3s values ranged from 0.59 to 0.71 with a mean value of 0.650.040. comparatively lower ENC was linked to higher GC3s values. eukaryotic organisms with very high GC-contents have high GC3-composition. RCBS value of a gene can be used as an effective measure of predicting gene expression. the distribution of RCBS values for TP53 gene across eight mammalian species is shown in figure below. RCBS values ranged from 0.006 to 0.065 with a mean value of 0.039 and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.021. codon usage patterns in TP53 genes across mammalian species were analyzed using heat map. the color coding red represents the positive correlation, green as negative correlation. black fields are stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) and non-degenerate codons (ATG, TGG) together with ATA codons for isoleucine. nucleotide composition analysis suggested that GC\u2014ending codons might be preferred over AT\u2014ending codons in the coding sequences of TP53 genes across mammalian species. the frequency was allied with statistical analysis to find out the highest and lowest frequently used codon. 53.8 8 276 234 307 365 62 86 115 131 43.1 56.9 59.1 49.0 62.4 37.6 54.1 Mean 270.9 227.5 307 361.5 59.9 75.9 119 134.1 42.7 57.3 57.7 49.0 65.1 34.9 53.4 SD 10.30 12.05 9.79 12.6 7.18 10.6 7.60 9.06 0.016 0.016 0.011 0.005 0.040 0.040 0.008 the codon GCC, CGC (except Rattus norvegicus), ATC (except Tupaia chinensis), CTG, ACC (except Rattus norvegicus, Macaca mulatta), GTG (except Felis catus) were displayed as the over represented codons. the highest RSCU value was found for the codon CTG for leucine amino acid in all TP53 genes across mammalian species.

GC3 skew values ranged from 0.000 to -0.094, indicating that GC3 composition at the third position of codon might have played an important role in the codon usage bias [38]. RCBS value of a gene can be used as an effective measure of predicting gene expression. RCBS values ranged from 0.006 to 0.065 with a mean value of 0.039 and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.021. the most over-represented codon was CTG encoding the amino acid leucine in the TP53 gene of all the selected mammalian species. the codon usage pattern for TP53 in H. sapiens showed resemblance to that of M. mulatta; similarly, F. catus to C. lupus to R. norvigicus. eight mammalian species with accession number and length (bp) of coding sequences for TP53 gene were selected. we analyzed the skewness for AT, GC and GC3s of each coding sequence to estimate the base composition bias. Fk (k = 2, 3, 4 or 6) is the average of the Fk values for k-fold degenerate amino acids. the values of ENC ranged from 20 indicating strong codon bias in the gene using only one synonymous codon for the corresponding amino acid. 61 indicating no bias in the gene using all synonymous codons equally for the corresponding amino acid. RCBS value of each coding sequence of TP53 gene was calculated as follows. w c R C B = O C E [ O C ] where, Oc is the observed number of counts of codon c of the query sequence and E[O c] is the expected number of codon occurrences given the nucleotide distribution at three codon positions. chinensis KF921494.1 1152 2 Bos taurus AB571118.1 1161 3 Felis catus KJ511263.1 1161 4 Meriones unguiculatus AB033632.1 1173 6 Rattus norvegicus BC098663.1 1176 7 Macaca mulatta HM104191.1 1182 8 Homo sapiens U94788.1 1182 CDS NO: Coding sequence number. effective number of codons (EN the Fop value ranges from 0.36 for a gene showing uniform codon usage bias to 1 for a gene showing strong codon usage bias [45]. RSCU is defined as the observed frequency of a codon divided by the expected frequency if all codons are used equally for any particular amino acid. all statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software. cluster analysis (Heat map) of correlation coefficient of codons with GC3 and RSCU values of codons among the eight mammalian species were clustered using a hierarchical clustering method implemented in NetWalker software."}
