{"summary": "participants made choices between hypothetical safety partnerships. participants preferred an approach to safety based on partnerships between patients and staff rather than a model delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff. patients have been encouraged to reduce hospital-acquired infections by cleaning their hands and reminding service providers to observe hand hygiene protocols. they have been asked to contribute to the prevention of diagnostic errors, check medications,14,15 join safety committees,6,16 voice their safety concerns,17 and notify health care workers if errors are detected. studies of the attitudes of professionals provide some support for these concerns. Efforts to engage patients in safety initiatives have included badges encouraging patients to ask whether health care providers cleaned their hands. the first application of these methods to the study of hospital safety partnerships. this is, to our knowledge, the first application of these methods to the study of hospital safety partnerships. participants would prefer partnerships focusing on hand hygiene for patients rather than an approach encouraging staff to clean their hands. a patient-centered approach to safety partnerships needs to reflect these differences. we hypothesized a segment preferring a more active approach to safety partnerships and a segment preferring a less active role in safety. a segment preferring a more active role in safety partnerships would anticipate greater benefit. participants would prefer partnerships focusing on hand hygiene for patients rather than an approach encouraging patients to remind staff to clean their hands. participants would prefer partnerships focusing on hand hygiene for patients rather than an approach encouraging patients to remind staff to clean their hands. a segment of participants preferring a more active approach to safety partnerships would anticipate greater benefit, expect more encouragement to participate, and express more confidence in their ability to contribute. participants would prefer an approach in which patients and staff collaborate to improve safety rather than posters or signage. research team presented the study to 1,567 potential participants. 380 were called for service before completing the survey. eight equipment failures occurred, and nine declined to participate. focus groups or individual interviews were conducted with patients (n=18), family members or support persons (n=6), a Family Advisory Council (n=6), staff (n=18), and physicians (n=1) Staff participating in focus groups or interviews included registered nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, imaging technologists, clinical managers, and environmental aides. a safety Partnership Attitudes Questionnaire was developed to explore attitudes that might influence safety partnership preferences. we composed 33 Likert-type scale questions (strongly disagree to strongly agree) reflecting the Theory of planned behavior\u2019s five subscales. HYPs 5 and 6 were examined by entering Latent Gold Choice 4.5's individual utility coefficients into Sawtooth Software's Randomized First Choice simulator. simulations predict each participant\u2019s response to hypothetical safety partnerships created by combining attributes yielding the greatest utility. demographic characteristics of actively engaged and passively engaged segments Measure N % Latent class segment 2 Actively engaged Sample size 1,084 100 73.3 26.7 Sex 20.7*** Male 285 26.3 63.2 36.8 Female 797 73.7 77.0 23.0 Age, years 19,9*** 29 171 15.8 67.8 32.2 30\u201349 653 60.5 77.6 22.4 50\u201369 181 16.8 69.6 30.4 70 75 6.9 57.3 42.7 Setting 35.5*** researchers narrowed this information to 15 safety partnership attributes. attributes ranged from the point of care (eg, medication and identity double checks) to policy and governance. attitudes measured the anticipated benefits of patient safety behaviors. barriers reflected factors that might prevent participation in safety partnerships. self-efficacy reflected confidence in one\u2019s ability to contribute to safety partnerships. 96% of participants made identical choices to the two hold-out sets. the difference between predicted and recorded choices was 1.4%. the difference between predicted and recorded choices was 1.4%. both segments preferred that patients and staff double check patient\u2019s identity and medication accuracy. Consistent with HYP 2, an initiative encouraging patients to clean their hands was more important than asking patients to remind staff to clean their hands. both segments preferred signs (versus volunteers) reminding patients to wash their hands. important scores are grouped into three consensually derived categories: safety partnership options, communicating risk and safety information to patients. the segments with the highest importance score are bolded. staff encourage patients to ask about safety 0.60 8.89 0.41 4.63 Volunteers encourage patients to ask about safety 0.36 5.19 0.21 2.17 Staff encourage patients to ask about safety 1.11 15.17 0.62 6.90 Reporting safety concerns 58.22*** Patients are not encouraged to report safety concerns 2.01 16.70 0.76 6.85 Signs encourage patients to report safety concerns 0.64 9.59 0.52 6.15 Staff encourage patients to report safety concerns 0.01 14.16 0.45 5.10 Patient hand cleansing 58.15*** No one remind all patients are told about safety risks 0.40 4.75 0.03 0.37 All patients are told about safety risks 2.08 23.08 0.68 8.30 Safety partnership training 79.31*** Patients do not learn how to make care safer 2.52 13.97 0.60 5.84 Patients read how to make care safer 0.90 11.31 0.38 4.49 Patients watch a video and read how to make care safer 0.75 8.99 0.07 0.76 Patients watch a video, read, and use a checklist 0.87 10.98 0.16 1.81 Evidence patients report safety concerns to staff 0.82 10.98 0.65 7.67 Patients report safety concerns on an internet form 0.70 9.66 0.05 0.49 Safety partnership decision making 68.79*** Staff decide if patients will be asked to help make care safer 1.07 13.05 0.20 2.13 Patients decide whether to help make care safer 0.45 6.78 0.23 2.55 Staff and patients together decide if patients will help make care safer 0.77 12.57 0.35 4.12 All patients are asked to help make care safer 0.75 11.76 0.08 0. actively engaged and passively engaged segments of the two-segment latent class solution were consistent with HYP 3\u2019s predictions. the actively engaged segment was linked to higher education, P0.001 and a greater intent to participate in safety partnerships, P0.01. actively engaged participants anticipated greater benefits to partnerships, reported more confidence in their ability to contribute. passively engaged membership in the passively engaged segment was associated with lower education and a lower intent to participate in safety partnerships. participants who were immigrants were more likely to reside in this segment. HYP 5 simulations predicted that both actively (100%) and passively engaged (91%) participants would prefer partnerships with staff rather than a model delegating safety to staff alone. 57.5% of participants would prefer personal engagement, while 42.4% would prefer visual engagement. passively engaged participants would be more likely to choose visual engagement (59.7%) safety partnership options Importance scores show the relative influence of variations in the levels of each attribute on partnership choices. both segments preferred that patients and staff double check patient\u2019s identity and medication accuracy. important scores are grouped into three consensually derived categories. safety partnership options, communicating risk and safety information to patients and the safety partnership process. the segments with the highest importance score are bolded. checks if correct patient 3.75 8.96 0.80 7.05 Staff double check if correct patient 1.57 10.36 0.45 5.10 Patients double check if correct patient 0.14 0.89 0.18 1.79 Staff and patients double check if correct patient 2.04 13.26 0.52 5.84 Asking safety questions 52.23*** Patients are not encouraged to ask about safety 2.06 16.62 0.81 7.17 Signs encourage patients to ask about safety 0.60 8.89 0.41 4.63 Volunteers encourage patients to ask about safety 0.36 5.19 0. volunteers tell patients to remind staff to clean their hands 0.53 8.99 0.36 4.41 Staff tell patients to remind staff to clean their hands 0.40 6.66 0.01 0.12 Disclosing safety risks 143.49*** Patients are not told about safety risks 2.13 15.90 0.80 7.54 Patients decide if they will be told about safety risks 0.46 6.13 0.09 1.03 Staff decide if patients will be told about safety risks 0.40 4.75 0.03 0.37 All patients are told about safety risks 2.08 23.08 0. are thanked 0.37 5.46 0.05 0.56 Are told what the hospital will do 0.44 6.50 0.14 1.61 Are thanked and told what the hospital will do 0.44 6.50 0.14 1.61 Are thanked and told what the hospital will do 1.25 17.58 0.57 6.99 Safety reporting format 71.44*** No formal way of reporting safety concerns 2.09 14.96 0.65 6.18 Patients report safety concerns to staff 0.82 10.98 0.65 7.67 Patients report safety concerns on a paper and pencil form 0.56 7. safety partnership process The safety reporting process and the hospital\u2019s response to safety questions exerted a moderate influence on choices. both segments preferred that patients report safety concerns directly to staff and that those reporting concerns were thanked and informed about the hospital\u2019s response. safety committee members 12 5.1 (0.7) 12 4.6 (0.1) 10 6.2 (0.4) Reminding staff to clean their hands 15 3.4 (0.3) 15 3.3 (0.0) 13 3.6 (0.5) Communicating risk and safety information to patients. important scores are grouped into three consensually derived categories. 87.87*** No one double checks that medications are correct 3.83 9.68 0.94 7.85 Staff double checks that medications are correct 1.47 10.27 0.53 6.19 Patients double check that medications are correct 0.18 1.25 0.21 2.19 Staff and patients double check that medications are correct 2.18 14.89 0.62 7.13 Identity double checks 83.94*** No one double checks if correct patient 3.75 8.96 0.80 7.05 Staff double check if correct patient 1.57 10.36 0.45 5.10 Patients double check if correct 0% of hospital safety committees include patients 1.61 15.25 0.75 6.87 33% of hospital safety committees include patients 0.44 6.86 0.16 1.92 67% of hospital safety committees include patients 0.60 9.26 0.23 2.70 100% of hospital safety committees include patients 0.58 8.22 0.35 3.83 Patients reminding staff to clean their hands 56.77*** Patients are not told to remind staff to clean their hands 1.07 12.39 0.05 0.51 Signs tell patients to remind staff to clean their hands 0.53 8.99 staff explain that research shows patients need to help make care safer 1.05 13.76 0.41 4.70 Disclosing mistakes 124.03*** Staff do not tell patients about mistakes 1.75 15.14 0.45 4.64 Patients decide if they will be told about mistakes 0.26 3.53 0.20 2.30 Staff tell patients about all mistakes 1.47 18.29 0.11 1.12 Response to safety questions (patients reporting safety concerns) 64.08*** Are not thanked or told what the hospital will do 2.06 16.94 0.76 7.01 Are than 0.35 0.22 2.28 Patients reporting safety concerns must give their names 0.84 11.53 0.27 2.77 Note: U, zero-centered utility coefficients reflect a stronger preference.
