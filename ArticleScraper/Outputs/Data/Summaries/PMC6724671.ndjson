{"summary": "total RNA samples obtained from human coronaviruses were pooled before sequence analysis. a conserved stem\u2013loop structure (SL2) residing in the HCoV-229E 5\u2032 UTR was replaced with the equivalent SL2 element from SARS-CoV and BCoV. reads that were not aligned by minimap2 were mostly very short (median 200 nt), of poor basecalling quality and represented only 0.62% and 0.15% of total nucleotides. we decided to only use the higher quality reads that minimap2 could align (for detailed statistics, see Supplemental Fig. S2). the 3\u2032-coverage is further increased by the directional sequencing that starts from the mRNA 3\u2032-terminal poly(A) tail. the remainder of the high 5\u2032-coverage bias likely reflects the presence of high numbers of DI-RNAs in which 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-proximal genomic sequences were fused. in canonical sg RNAs gives rise to the sharp coverage peak at the 5\u2032-end. we hypothesize that sequences correspond to DI-RNA molecules that may arise by recombination at TRS-like sequence motifs. we attribute the difference in the observed (noncanonical) recombination sites between the two samples to biological factors that we either did not control for or do not know. the median read length for the combined set of reads from both samples was 826 nt, with a maximum of 26,210 nt covering 99.86% of the 27,276-nt-long virus genome. most of the viral RNAs identified in HCoV-229E\u2013infected cells were 2000 nt in length. this number nearly doubles the longest read length that can be obtained with short-read sequencing methods. we obtained 99.15% and 98.79% identity in both samples (WT, SL2), respectively, using the reference genomes and all reads mapping to it. we attempted a standard long-read assembly using Canu (Koren et al. 2017), which yielded unusable results. we observe all known canonical HCoV-229E mRNAs at their expected lengths, including the (presumably) noncoding mRNA 3. on circular axis, the annotations of the reference genome (including 5\u2032 UTR [5U] and 3\u2032 UTR [3U] are shown. nanopore-based sequencing allows more detailed analysis of recombination events owing to the long read length. even complex isoforms such as two exemplary reads can be observed. aligned reads distribution revealed clusters for all known mRNAs which closely fit the expected molecule lengths. nanopore sequencing captures recombination events far better than Illumina. we found sg RNAs with up to four recombination sites in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal genome regions. by using a trained model, DNA and RNA modifications such as 5mC methylation could be identified. the estimated FPR is 5%. methylation of coronavirus RNAs is sequence-specific and controlled by RNA structural elements. the overall methylation pattern looks similar between sg RNAs and the negative control. we achieved a throughput of 0.237 and 0.282 Gb with 225,000 and 181,000 reads. for the WT and SL2 samples, 33.3% and 35.9% of reads mapped to reference HCoV-229E sequences. 47.4% and 52.7% could be attributed again to HCoV, human or yeast. basecalling errors were reduced for human and virus reads. the basecaller was trained on this calibration strand. this included gaps but omitted discontinuous sites >6 nt because they indicated recombination. only 278 and 181 aviruses had multiple splits for the SL2 and HCoV-229E samples. the difference in the observed (noncanonical) recombination sites between the two samples is explained by the high abundance of potential DI-RNA molecules. alignment of reads to these canonical mRNA sequences confirmed these observed abundances. clusters that correspond well with the transcript lengths expected for canonical mRNAs (vertical dotted lines) 276-nt-long virus genome missing only 21 nt at the 5\u2032-end, 15 nt at the 3\u2032-end, and those nucleotides that correspond to the skewed error distribution. most of the viral RNAs identified in HCoV-229E\u2013infected cells were 2000 nt in length. this number nearly doubles the longest read length that can be obtained with short-read sequencing methods. we thereby recovered 99.57% of the reference genome in a single contiguous sequence at 99.90% sequence identity to reference using this approach. this hybrid approach illustrates how short- and long-read technologies can be combined to reconstruct long transcripts accurately. recombination sites can be seen at intergenic boundaries and at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. another prominent cluster can be observed in ORF1a in the WT nanopore sample but not in SL2. the mapping algorithm was often unable to align these erroneous 5\u2032-ends. the included leader sequence was not aligned, which gives rise to the secondary peak at each cluster position. we also observed several unexpected recombination sites, for example, at positions 3000\u20134000. positions have been labeled \u201cmethylated\u201d if at least 90% of the reads show a methylation signal. using this threshold, the estimated FPR was calculated to be 5%. only 12% of the sg RNAs were found to conform to our current understanding of discontinuous mRNA transcription in coronaviruses, resulting in mRNAs that carry an identical 5\u2032-leader sequence that is fused to the 3\u2032-coding (\u201cbody\u201d) sequence of the respective mRNA. we believe that 12% represents an underestimate because a large number of sg RNAs were probably omitted from the analysis. the RNA used for DRS was isolated from cells infected with a serially passaged pool of recombinant viruses. transfection of preparations of in vitro transcribed RNA of this large size likely included a significant proportion of abortive transcripts that lacked varying parts of the 3\u2032 genome regions. the presence of replication-incompetent RNAs lacking essential 3\u2032-terminal genome regions may have triggered recombination events. sg RNA transcription may also involve noncanonical TRS motifs. the majority of sg RNAs (other than mRNAs) likely represent DI-RNAs. this study is the first to perform RNA modification calling without prior treatment of the input sample. the resquiggle algorithm has to align the raw nanopore read signal to the basecalled read sequence. this is necessary to test the raw signal against learned modification models. the validity of the methylation signal should be confirmed in future studies using, for example, bisulfite sequencing. the reading of RNA modifications from the read signal has great potential to elucidate viral biology. we were able to reconstruct accurate consensus sequences, for both the Illumina and Nanopore data. this was only possible for sg-length (DI-) RNAs. nanopore sequencing was a trade-off between sensitivity to identify recombination sites and unspecific mapping. we were able to directly sequence the RNA molecules of two different samples of one of the largest RNA virus genomes known to date. this was a trade-off between sensitivity to identify recombination sites and unspecific mapping. cDNA copies of genomes of HCoV-229E, HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV were engineered into recombinant vaccinia viruses using previously described methods. cDNA copies of genomes of HCoV-229E, HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV were 1.5 g of full-length viral genome RNA, 0.75 g of in vitro transcribed HCoV-229E nucleocapsid protein mRNA were used to transfect 1 106 Huh7 cells using the TransIT-mRNA transfection kit. at 72 h post transfection, cell culture supernatants were collected and serially passaged in Huh7 cells for 21 (WT) or 12 times. all mappings were performed with minimap2 (v2.8-r672) (Li 2018) using the \u201cspliced\u201d preset without observing the canonical GULAG splicing motif (parameter -u n), and k-mer size set to 14 (-k 14) read origin and sequencing error statistics were assessed by mapping the reads simultaneously with minimap2 to a concatenated mock-genome consisting of HCoV-229E (WT and Illumina HiSeq sequencing was performed using the TruSeq RNA v2 kit to obtain RNA from species with poly(A) tails. the three samples were prepared on a HiSeq 2500 lane and sequenced with 51 cycles. the raw sequencing data were deposited at the OSF. to count as a putative hit, 95% of the read length had to uniquely map to a given mock transcript. the mock transcript could not be >5% longer than the read. we only considered putative hits as plausible if they had a read support of at least five. cDNA copies of genomes of HCoV-229E, HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV, respectively, were engineered into recombinant vaccinia viruses using previously described methods. full-length genomic RNAs of HCoV-229E, HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E_SL2-BC nanopore sequencing and long-read assessment For nanopore sequencing, 1 g of RNA in 9 L was carried into the library preparation with the Oxford Nanopore DRS protocol (SQK-RNA001) the library was then loaded on an R9.4 flow cell and sequenced on a MinION device (ONT) the sequencing run was terminated after 48 h. HG-CoLoR was run with default parameters except for the maximum order of the de Bruijn graph. the program builds a de Bruijn graph from the near noise-free short-read data and then substitutes fragments of the noisy long reads with paths found in the graph. we first defined TRS as an 8-mer with a maximum Hamming distance of two from the motif UCUCAACU. for each pair of complementary 8-mers (5\u2032-TRS, 3\u2032-TRS), we accepted at most one mismatch to simulate base-pairing under a stable energy state. to count as a putative hit, 95% of the read length had to uniquely map to a given mock transcript. mRNA standard is not methylated for a conservative resquiggle match score of 1.3. methylation threshold of 0.9 met our requirement that the FPR be 5%."}
