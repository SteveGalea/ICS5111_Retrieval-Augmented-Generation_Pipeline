{"summary": "196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study from July 2012 to July 2013 in Guangzhou, china. a total of 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study. sepsis can be defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. severe sepsis is sepsis combined with acute organ dysfunction. mortality rate from sepsis is 10\u201320%, and mortality rate from severe sepsis 20\u201350%. in sepsis, IFN- is an important regulator of infection and inflammation. it is released in small amounts during the initial period of infection. increased IFN- levels during the later period may be beneficial by stimulating the body\u2019s defense system [16] sepsis and four functional SNPs of IFN-. these included two SNPs in the 5\u2032 UTR 1616T/C (rs2069705) and 764G/C (rs2069707), as well as two SNPs in the introns +874A/T (rs2430561, intron1) and +3234C/T (rs2069718, intron 3). 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis were enrolled exclusion criteria were 18 years of age, primary site of infection other than the lungs, un-drainable surgical source of sepsis, missing informed consent forms and patients with immunosuppression of any etiology. the severe group included those who experienced organ dysfunction, and the severity of organ dysfunction was graded according to the APACHE II and SOFA indexes. the raw data from the ABI 3130XL sequencer were subjected to analysis with GeneMapper 4.0 (ABI). the raw data from the sequencer were subjected to analysis with GeneMapper 4.0 (ABI). the significance threshold was adjusted to 0.025 and >0.025, with 0.05 considered as the margin. for every comparison, odds ratios (OR) with respective confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. for significant and marginal P values, OR >1 and 95% CI >1 indicated susceptibility. the volunteers have agreed on a verbal consent that their peripheral blood will be used for harmless, non-profit purpose only. the practice of verbally informed consent was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee. the control group entries in our database included no personal information but sex, age and peripheral blood sample number only. PCR products were purified using shrimp alkaline enzyme (SAP) (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) and exonuclease I (EXO I) (EpiCentre, Palmerston North, New Zealand) according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions and were used as a template for extension. the raw data from the ABI 3130XL sequencer were subjected to analysis with GeneMapper 4.0 (ABI). allele, genotype and haplotype were compared using the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. the significance threshold was adjusted to 0.025 and >0.025, with 0.05 considered as the margin. all patients were treated for sepsis in the ICU and received specific antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. the sex ratio was nearly 11, the mean age was 64.09 years and the standard deviation was 20.67 (Table 2). the control group included 213 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers, and the t test showed no significant differences in age and APACHE II and SOFA scores according to the t test (P0.0001) APACHE = 20(n = 94) APACHE>20(n = 102) P value Discharged(n = 109) Death(n = 87) P value Age (meanSD)a 64.0920.67 63.5720.68 0.905 57.0221.43 70.0418.06 0.0001 61.0421.18 67.5819.61 0.026 56.8722.19 70.5516.86 0.001 62.4620.62 association of the IFN- SNPs with risk of Sepsis. the 1616, +874 and +3234 loci formed three dominant haplotypes. the genotype frequency indicated different trends for sepsis risk.
