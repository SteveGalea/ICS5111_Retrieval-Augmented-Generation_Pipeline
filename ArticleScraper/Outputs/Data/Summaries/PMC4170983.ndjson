{"summary": "the onset of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, WHO deployed more than 3 million courses of antivirals to 72 countries in the span of 3 weeks directly from a manufacturer and nearly half a million additional courses to 20 countries within 1 week. the success of this rapid deployment of antivirals was due in part to extensive pandemic preparedness planning by the WHO team in charge of the antiviral stockpile and by many other countries. this was supposed to be a rapid emergency deployment of medical countermeasures. it took more than a year to complete following the declaration of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. this complex process yielded a number of lessons regarding the international deployment of medical countermeasures. to respond to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak included funds that were used to acquire and deploy pandemic influenza medical countermeasures. the ISMPG has received and considered more than 20 requests for medical countermeasures from the SNS from foreign countries. other countries may choose to create similar dedicated groups to understand the relevant domestic and international laws and policies. Developing legal terms and conditions among donors, recipients, and WHO was a significant issue during the international deployment of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. potential donor and recipient countries and organizations may want to explore in advance what domestic terms and conditions they would require to rapidly deploy and/or receive medical countermeasures. medical countermeasures can be used under EUA if the totality of the evidence makes it reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. potential recipient countries may consider developing or strengthening processes to authorize the emergency use of medical countermeasures in their own country or to allow for fast-tracking or waiving standard regulatory requirements. a priority for the international community moving forward should be to foster efforts to establish a new process for rapid regulatory approval of new or existing unapproved products to be used during emergencies. the current WHO prequalification process could be adapted to aid in the rapid international deployment and use of medical countermeasures during a public health emergency. recipient countries and/or freight forwarders may have different standards or guidelines they must adhere to, as seen during the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine deployment. logistical challenge was securing commercial flights with sufficient cargo space to accommodate large containers. long shipping distances also presented challenges in maintaining cold-chain, with some vaccine having to be repacked at various airports during transport. the ability to rapidly transport and distribute medical countermeasures during a public health emergency can be facilitated and potentially expedited. funding Developing, acquiring, and stockpiling medical countermeasures is typically a complex process for the country or institution carrying out these activities. there is currently no specific funding set aside for the deployment of emergency medical countermeasures internationally, nor are sufficient mechanisms to rapidly transfer funding to WHO or among countries to support public health emergency responses. in the event of a large-scale or acute emergency response, the US government may request supplemental appropriations from the US Congress specifically for that emergency or may consider reprograming funds. this process can be time consuming and certainly slow down the provision of international assistance. 26 countries, manufacturers, and international organizations may decide to work to identify, develop, and strengthen funding mechanisms for nonflu medical countermeasure deployment on a global scale. the ISMPG has received and considered more than 20 requests for medical countermeasures from the SNS from foreign countries. other countries and international organizations may choose to create similar dedicated groups to understand the relevant domestic and international laws and policies. some medical countermeasures in the SNS are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. potential donor and recipient countries may want to explore in advance what domestic terms and conditions they would require to rapidly deploy and/or receive medical countermeasures. potential recipient countries may consider pursuing bilateral or multilateral engagements to discuss joint preparedness plans. the WHO prequalification process requires that the manufacturer in at least 1 country license the product, but it is not designed to apply to medical countermeasures that have not been approved for routine use in their countries of origin. this may present a significant problem in future responses to CBRN incidents in which the only medical countermeasures available are unapproved in the country of origin. export controls and nonproliferation activities that can affect the ability to deploy or receive medical countermeasures are regulated by a number of federal agencies, including the US Departments of State, Commerce, Homeland Security, Treasury, Defense, and Energy. the Commerce Control List, which falls under the Export Administration Regulations, may pose export restrictions on deploying certain medical countermeasures to certain recipient nations. logistical challenge was securing commercial flights with sufficient cargo space to accommodate large containers. insurance for the cargo and responsibility for it also generated delays. long shipping distances also presented challenges in maintaining cold-chain capacity in recipient countries. the cost of the deployment of medical countermeasures may need to be funded. there is currently no specific funding set aside for the deployment of emergency medical countermeasures internationally. there is currently no specific funding set aside for the deployment of emergency medical countermeasures. 26 countries,

the global health security agenda presents a unique opportunity for the international community to commit to lay a framework for cooperation during a response to public health emergencies. for Animal and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI) is a trilateral effort among the united states, canada, and Mexico. it focuses on strengthening the ability of all 3 countries to jointly prepare and respond to pandemic threats. the global health security initiative (GHSI) is a ministerial-level collaboration among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the united states, the European Commission, and the european commission. the current Ebola outbreak is a clear example of this. it is challenging to ramp up production, conduct clinical trials, and distribute the scarce resources in a fair and equitable manner. this situation has raised many of the legal, regulatory, and logistical issues discussed here. the authors thank international partners that have contributed to pursuing collaborations on this critical preparedness issue. the authors also thank international partners that have contributed to pursuing collaborations on this critical preparedness issue."}
