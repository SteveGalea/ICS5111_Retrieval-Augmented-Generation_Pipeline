{"summary": "emerging infections with nonspecific symptoms have enormous impact on public health and global economics. such outbreaks emphasize the need for efficient simultaneous detection of multiple organisms that will facilitate timely and judicious implementation of countermeasures for outbreak containment. the accuracy of the base calls from the array has been compared with only de novo sequencing using culture isolates of clinical samples. a set of 424 clinical samples collected in the Washington, DC metropolitan region from December 2004 to February 2005 were subjected to a full panel of conventional microbial analysis (culture and/or RT-PCR/PCR) the accuracy of the base calls was confirmed by comparison to de novo sequencing using representative clinical samples. this comparison of a broad-spectrum viral and bacterial identification technology with a large battery of conventional \u201cgold standard\u201d assays represents more rigorous testing of our approach for both medical surveillance and investigation of complex etiologies. hybridization was carried out in the oven at 45\u00b0C and 60 rev/min for 4 hours. final pathogen identification for the RPM v.1 assay was performed using computer-Implemented Biological Sequence Identifier (CIBSI) version 2.0 software [19], an automatic pathogen identification algorithm. initial PCR analyses of difficult-to-culture pathogens were performed at NHRC Respiratory Disease Laboratory or FOCUS Diagnostics, Inc. (Cypress, CA) further species-specific RT/PCR amplification assays were performed on culture-negative but RPM v.1-positive samples with positive (culture-positive, RPM v.1-positive) and negative (culture-negative, RPM v.1-negative) controls. patients recruited from both emergency department and clinic settings. patient samples were stored in CVM media for viral culture processing. samples were stored in tryptic soy broth with glycerol. a specimen was defined as \u201cpositive\u201d for a pathogen if the composite assay results (culture and/or duplicate PCR assays) were positive. samples were then analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens. 25 l PCR reactions were run on myiQTM real-time PCR detection systems (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) Sequencing reactions were performed by SequeTech (Mountain View, CA) Sequence alignments for influenza-positive samples were performed on HA3 hemagglutinin sequences using MagAlign function of Lasergene version 6 (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison, WI) RPM v.1 also identified type I and III parainfluenza (PIV) virus, PIV1 (1, 0.2%), PIV3 (2, 0.5%), rhinovirus type 89 (2, 0.5%), M. pneumoniae (3, 0.7%), and Neisseria meningitides (14,3.3%) which were not identified by culture. influenza virus was the most commonly identified respiratory pathogen by all methods. the RPM v.1 method showed a detection sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 96%, and an overall agreement of 98% for influenza A virus. quantitative real-time PCR data showed that most of the S. pneumoniae present in influenza-positive samples harbored a high titer (104 genome copies/l) the high titer bacteria present in these clinical samples harbored a high titer (104 genome copies/l) influenza A H3N2 positive isolates were identified by a CAP-certified PCR method, N.C. no coinfection found, samples may have identified as positive for one of the organisms. a critical aspect for influenza epidemiology is to track genetic changes within influenza strains. v.1 from 250 influenza A/H3N2 isolates. position aa/nt* Amino acid and nucleotide substitution. aa and nucleotide positions correspond to the \u201cprototype sequence\u201d for hemagglutinin of influenza A/H3N2 (HA3) on RPM v.1. the number in the parenthesis correspond to the position of full length HA3 sequence, & amino acid and its codon at each position were separated by \u201c/\u201d. further confirmation using all HA3 sequences produced the same groups that were identified by tracking key amino acid substitutions. both groups apparently originated from the common ancestor A/Fujian/411/2002 lineage. the strains had longer distances than New York-like strains suggesting that Wellington-like strains had more genetic variations. the detection sensitivity for Coronaviruses and S. pneumoniae by RPM v.1 is lower compared to the PCR methods. however, the specificity remains very high for all organisms. the ability to test for multiple pathogens is increasingly recognized as a necessity, especially in cases where differential diagnosis of etiological agents is difficult. 58 (13.7%) of the tested samples showed viral or viral co-infections (Table 4). it is a challenge that will only increase in difficulty as more organisms are covered to establish the validity of any broad spectrum platform against \u201cgold\u201d standards. the majority of the clinical samples tested are positive for influenza A/B virus (74%) the RPM v.1 is designed as a proof-of-concept microarray for the detection of more than 20 common respiratory pathogens encountered among military basic trainees with large section of the chip dedicated to adenoviruses and influenza viruses. the major causes of the common cold, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are under represented on the RPM v.1. pathogens can be partitioned into subsets for amplifications that are recombined for chip analysis. in the future, the more variable pathogens can be partitioned into their own mix so that the performance for the conserved pathogens i.e. bacteria are not affected when primers are changed."}
