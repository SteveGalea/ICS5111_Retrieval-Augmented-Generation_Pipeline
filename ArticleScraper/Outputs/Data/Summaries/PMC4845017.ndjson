{"summary": "a total of 183 megabats consisting of four different species were included in this study. among these, Pteropus hypomelanus and Dobsonia sp. were not identified at species level, but other genetically close species Pteropus hypomelanus and Dobsonia moluccensis were included21. we used nested-PCR targeting for the NS1 gene of BuV using 183 spleens and 96 faeces samples paguyaman district 2012 0/17 0/17 Total 4/183 9/96 *Genetically closely related to Pteropus hypomelanus. *Not tested because of unavailability of faeces. Known BuVs formed subgroups by host were distinguishable from other protoparvoviruses. mgBuV1, MgBuV2 and MgBuV3 diverged from a common ancestor of known protoparvoviruses. sequences identified in this study are coloured in red. NS1 contained putative endonuclease metal coordination motif \u201cHIH\u201d and the helicase motif Walker A \u201cGPASTGKS\u201d. three potential sites responsible for the enzymatic activity of PLA2 were strictly conserved in the VP1 of MgBuV1. six partial genome sequences of human bufavirus were identified from insectivorous microbats in Hungary and china13,14. these sequences covered a partial coding region of NS1 and almost complete to complete coding regions of VP1 and VP2. each microbat-borne BuV formed a single cluster (group 5, Fig. 3). phylogenetic analysis based on the VP2 gene. the sequence identified in this study is coloured in red. the sequence identified in this study is coloured in red. abcissae represent positions adjusted to reflect the position in the megabat bufavirus 1 genome. the ordinate shows the percentage of permuted trees supporting the clustering in each window. phylogenetic analyses showed a large degree of genetic divergence of BuV in the genus Protoparvovirus. phylogenetic relationships between these viruses remains to be elucidated. logenetic analyses based on NS1 and VP2 genes showed that a group of BuVs comprised host-specific lineages and megabat-borne BuVs were clearly distinguished from microbat-borne BuVs. further studies of BuVs in animals are needed to infer the virus-host coevolution. the protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Bogor Agricultural University. samples were collected from megabats at eight regions in Indonesia from 2010 to 2014. some samples were used for different research projects, as reported previously21,29,30,31. overlapping large fragments were amplified by conventional PCR. the 3\u2032 end of virus genome was amplified by the modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends. phylogenetic inferences were performed on multiple sequence alignments with MrBayes 3.234. all hypotheses were tested under the same model assumed for the phylogenetic analyses. the dataset in both analyses was composed of sequences in the BuV cluster. s three and strongly supportive when it exceeds five38. sequence reads homologous to known BuVs were identified by read mapping using the miSeq Reagent Kit v3 600-cycle (Illumina) the overlapping large fragments were amplified by conventional PCR with specific primer sets designed from each identified sequence read. null hypothesis of clustering of two particular sequences was tested against the null hypothesis that the cluster was less likely than those independently clustering with any other under the same model parameters. the difference of the calculated marginal likelihoods for both models, i.e., the model assuming a clustering and the model without the clustering, represented the Bayes factor."}
