{"summary": "influenza C was detected among 59 of 10 202 (0.58%) hospitalized severe ARI cases and 11 of 2282 (0.48%) outpatients. most detections occurred from December to March, 73% during the 2014\u20132015 season. patients qualified as a possible SARI case if they were admitted to an inpatient unit for ARI or asthma exacerbation with 1 or more ARI symptoms. medical records were reviewed for all patients with submitted specimens using a standardized case report form. Sequencing of HEF Genes HEF genetic sequence analysis was performed on influenza C\u2013positive specimens with ample residual volume and rRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) values. PCR products were purified by ExoSAP-IT for the PCR Product Clean-Up kit (USB Corporation) Sequencing reactions were performed using an Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an Applied Biosystems Sequencer 3730 DNA Analyzer. medical records were reviewed for all patients with submitted specimens using a standardized case report form (CRF) Outpatient Surveillance The Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project (IISP) conducts surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and ARI through 4 primary care clinics that serve patients of all ages.

Interestingly, the C/Kanagawa lineage was overrepresented among hospitalized cases, whereas the C/Sao Paulo lineage was more evenly the annual variability seen in our study illustrates the risk of missing outbreaks of this disease with intermittent testing. studies from japan and canada have found peaks in the winter and spring seasons, which are consistent with our findings. the presence of at least 6 influenza C lineages raises the question of whether exposure to new strains might allow infection of previously exposed individuals. the sample numbers were small, and we were unable to find any differences between strains with respect to age or geographic distribution. however, we did find the C/Kanagawa lineage more consistently among hospitalized cases. ongoing testing through established surveillance systems will make it possible to identify the emergence of new antigenic lineages. clinical testing was done at the discretion of the treating clinician. some patients may not have had testing ordered or had a residual specimen for testing at MDH, leading to an underestimation of cases. a second caveat is that children are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections. influenza C is detected in a minority of patients with symptomatic respiratory illness but may be a cause of severe disease and periodic outbreaks. supplementary data Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online."}
