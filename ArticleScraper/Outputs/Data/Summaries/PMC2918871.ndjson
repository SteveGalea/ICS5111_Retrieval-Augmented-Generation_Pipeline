{"summary": "coronavirus genome encodes for a 5\u2032 replicase polyprotein (ORF1a and ORF1b) that encodes for all enzymes required for viral RNA replication. genome encodes for 3\u2032 structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), common to all coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who presented with fever and cough [3], and HCoV-NL63 isolated from a seven-month-old baby. the virus has not been detected in the human population since 2004 [16, 17]. group 1 contains transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PDEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus and HCoV-229E. group 2 contains mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus, haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. HCoV-NL63 has a single-stranded RNA genome that is 27553 bases in size. the genome is 27553 bases in size, with the genome order 5\u2032-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N-polyT-3\u2032. the genome is capped and polyadenylated, with the genome order 5\u2032-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-ORF3-E-M ORFs S (1), E (2), M (3) and N (4) are shown. open reading frames encoding for accessory genes are shaded in grey. a mini-review of the putative ORF1a/1b products and functions see Pryc et al. (2007). HCoV-NL63 S is a single-chain glycoprotein and consists of an N-terminal receptor-binding domain (S1) and a C-terminal transmembrane fusion domain (S2). S2 consists of two highly conserved heptad-repeat sequences larger than the corresponding regions for the group II and group III coronaviruses [20, 27, 33]. the HCoV-NL63 ORF3 gene encodes for a putative 225 amino acid protein, about 25.6 kDa in size. the protein of HCoV-NL63 is homologous to proteins of the other group 1 coronaviruses, with an amino acid sequence most similar to HCoV-229E ORF4. seven distinct ORFs are produced from six distinct mRNAs. the five sg mRNAs encode for the viral structural and accessory proteins S, ORF3, E, M and N. a common transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), with core sequence AACUAAA, is located upstream of all the ORFs. protein 1a/1b HCoV-NL63 ORF1a/1b contains a putative elaborated pseudoknot structure that triggers a -1 ribosomal frameshift to translate the complete 1ab polyprotein. the group identified and characterized two viral papain-like proteases, PLP1 and PLP2, which process the viral replicase polyprotein. S2 consists of two highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) sequences that are larger than the corresponding regions for the group II and group III coronaviruses. initial proteolytic studies of the S2 fusion core identified an -helical domain consisting of a trimer of the HR segments N57 and C42. it has been suggested that larger HR regions of the group I coronaviruses may be required to prime the S proteins for their fusion the HCoV-NL63 ORF3 gene has a unique nucleotide composition. it appears as a U-rich and A-poor region within the genome, indicating a recent gene transfer event from another viral or cellular origin. the protein is homologous to proteins of the other group 1 coronaviruses. the group identified and characterized two viral papain-like proteases, PLP1 and PLP2, which process the viral replicase polyprotein. the group identified and characterized two viral papain-like proteases, PLP1 and PLP2, which process the viral replicase polyprotein. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are group I coronaviruses. both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E encode for only one accessory gene product between the S and E genes. accessory genes are poorly characterized and the functions of the gene products are not well understood. HCoV-NL63 localizes along the secretory pathway (ERGIC, Golgi, plasma membrane) and co-localizes with the structural proteins M and E in the ERGIC. this suggests an important function for HCoV-NL63 ORF3. a recent study of coronaviruses in Thailand did not show any seasonal predilection. it is evident that the virus has no predilection to a particular season. it is not affected by temperature variations as infections can occur throughout the year. france NR RT-PCR Winter Hospitalized patients for ARI 300 Variable (18 cases under 2 years) 9.3% Absent Fever, rhinitis bronchiolitis, digestive problems, otitis, pharyngitis and conjuctivitis [29] Germany Naso pharyngeal secretions Real-time RT-PCR Winter Population-based (Inpatients+ outpatients) 949 3 years 5.2% Present Croup Bronchitis Bronchi a one-year study of children hospitalized in china has shown that respiratory tract infection with coronavirus accounts for 4.4% of all admissions for acute respiratory infections. HCoV-NL63 was the most common coronavirus identified with an incidence of 2.6%. 118 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from hospitalized children under two years of age were positive for HCoV-NL63 [50] in europe, 8.7% of the cases examined were caused by coronaviruses, with HCoV-NL63 accounting for 21.4% of the latter [51] in france, 300 respiratory specimens were checked for HCoV-NL63 presence; of the 300 samples, 28 (9.3%) were positive [29 co-infections with HCoV-NL63 and other respiratory viruses are common. co-infections include other human coronaviruses, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) co-infected patients more likely to be hospitalized. high prevalence of co-infections of HCoV-NL63 and other respiratory viruses increases the chances of genetic recombination with these human or zoonotically transmitted viruses. the virus is found during upper and lower respiratory tract infections, causing symptoms and signs that do not differ greatly from the symptoms described for the 'old' viruses. a group has reported the association between HCoV-NL63 and Kawasaki disease, a form of childhood vasculitis that is presented as fever, polymorphic exanthema, oropharyngeal erythema and bilateral conjuctivitis. however, others fail to report on this association [66, 67]. virus is able to survive for up to seven days in an aqueous solution and respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature. in heavily populated regions, direct person-to-person transmission is considered the major route of HCoV-NL63 spread. Canada Throat swab, nasopharygeal swab, lung autopsy RT-PCR Winter (January-March) patients with ARI 525 1 month-100 years 3.6%(13 males and 6 females) Absent Fever, rhinitis cough, sore throat, bronchiolitis [45] France NR RT-PCR Winter (February) Hospitalized patients for ARI 300 Variable (18 cases under 2 years) 9.3% Abs a one-year study of children hospitalized in china has shown that respiratory tract infection with coronavirus accounts for 4.4% of all admissions for acute respiratory infections. HCoV-NL63 was the most common coronavirus identified with an incidence of 2.6%. a study in japan has shown that out of 419 specimens that tested negative for common respiratory viruses, five (1.2%) were positive for human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 [49] out of 118 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from hospitalized children younger than two years of age, three (2.5%) were positive for HCoV-NL63 [50] in europe, high prevalence was also noted. in france, 300 respiratory specimens were HCoV-NL63 is the most common co-infection indentified in children less than three years of age. HCoV-NL63 circulates as mixture of variant strains and is often associated with other viral infections. the viral load of HCoV-NL63 is lower in co-infected patients. the 'old' viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause symptoms. bronchiolitis is inflammation of the membranes lining the bronchioles. a study in china did not report an association of HCoV-NL63. a group has reported the association between HCoV-NL63 and croup. a form of childhood vasculitis is presented as fever, polymorphic exanthema, oropharyngeal erythema and bilateral conjuctivitis. however, others fail to report on this association. RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples, both frozen and fresh, is the most popular choice for detection of HCoV-NL63. viral culture is frequently used for confirmation of infection. ELISA assay showed high seropositive results for serum samples from children younger than 20 years old. RT-PCR and other nucleic acid tests are the preferred methods for diagnosis of coronavirus infections. the majority of nucleic acid amplification tests is designed with the ORF1a/1b. RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples, both frozen and fresh, is the most popular choice for detection of HCoV-NL63. HCoV-NL63 infection of humans is common and usually acquired during childhood. cross reaction between human coronaviruses has been reported for immunoflourescence and complement fixation tests [78, 79] false positive results were also reported for SARS-CoV detection using ELISA tests based on the recombinant N antigen [80]. the substitution rate for HCoV-229E was calculated using partial sequences of the S gene from different known dates. the time to their most recent common ancestor was dated to the 11th century [24] this shows that HCoV-NL63 has been present in the human population for centuries. this is partly due to the view that they are only involved in mild respiratory tract infections. molecular and cell biology tools could help elucidate link between coronaviruses and human diseases of the respiratory tract, the vascular system, the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract."}
