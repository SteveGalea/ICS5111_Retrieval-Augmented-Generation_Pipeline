{"summary": "mutator variants of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) are attenuated in fruit flies and mice. mutator strains of RNA viruses present mutation frequency profiles similar to those of wild-type-like viruses whose mutation rates are extrinsically increased by treatment with RNA mutagens. DIs are truncated forms of viral genomes that accumulate during replication. because DIs lack one or several parts of coding/noncoding sequence, they highjack full-length virus proteins for replication, packaging, and transmission. they interfere with the replication of the full-length virus (20) DIs produced by SINV-G were implicated in interference with full-length virus replication. mutator in vivo attenuation may be overlooked and main contributor to mutator in vivo attenuation. cells were mixed with 10 g of in vitro-transcribed (IVT) viral RNA. cells were electroporated at 1.2 kV and 25 F with infinite in an XCell Gene Pulser. after 48 h, supernatant was collected and titrated by plaque assay. RNA from infected cells or virus suspension was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) RNA samples were prepared using NorthernMax formaldehyde loading dye (Ambion) and 1 l of ethidium bromide. samples were then separated on a 1.2% low-electroendosmosis (Lonza) gel containing 1 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) running buffer (Ambion) three milliliters of 20% sucrose diluted in PBS was poured in a 12.5-ml centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter) tube was centrifuged at 107,000 g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C using an Optima XPN-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) supernatant was removed, and purified virus pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and stored at 80\u00b0C 293T cells were transfected with a mix of RNA totalizing 0.5 g. pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid (Life Technologies) was engineered to express the construct of interest, linearized, and then transfected into BHK-21 cells. RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, quantified, diluted to 1 g/l, and stored at 80\u00b0C. cells were triedpsinized, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at a concentration of 2 107 cells/ml in ice-cold PBS. after 48 h, supernatant was collected and tit BHK-21 cells were infected for 1 h at 37\u00b0C at the MOI indicated in the text and figure legends. if the viral titer was too low to allow such an MOI, a fixed amount of 1.5 ml of supernatant was used to infect the next passage. nes were then washed three times with washing buffer (0.1 SSC\u20130.1% SDS in autoclaved water; 1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) at 68\u00b0C for 20 min and then imaged using amersham Hyperfilm MP autoradiography film (GE Healthcare). supernatant was centrifuge at 1,200 g for 5 min to remove dead cells and then treated with 10 g/ml of viral supernatant. cDNA was mixed with power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) for full-length genomes, 1634F (5\u2032-TGCGAAGTGGAGGGGCTCC-3\u2032) and 10565R (5\u2032-TGAAATTGGTCCAGCTATGACT-3\u2032) for Dwt (a defective genome in SINV-WT) the SINV mutator (SINV-G) had wild-type-like growth kinetics in one-step growth curves at low (Fig. 1A) and high (Fig. 1B) multiplicities of infection (MOIs) we thus passaged the SINV wild-type (SINV-WT) and SINV-G at a low (MOI of 1) and high (MOI of 25) MOI over 10 passages and assessed viral titers. SINV-G (dashed line) were passaged 10 times in BHK-21 cells at MOIs of 1 (C) or 25 (D), and virus titers were measured by plaque assay. data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posttest (*, P 0.05;***, P 0.001) the low-molecular-weight band detected in the SINV-G high-MOI samples was still present after RNase treatment. this defective genome, named Dg, retained the encapsidation signal and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. as expected, this defective genome, named Dg, retained the encapsidation signal and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. in vitro-transcribed RNA (lane 1) was used as an RT-PCR control. IVT RNAs incubated in solution (lane 2) and treated with RNase A (lane 3) were used as RNase controls. each protein-coding gene is depicted as a separate box. primers located at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the Dg breakpoint allowed the specific detection of Dg. Dg quickly accumulated during high-MOI passage of SINV-G (Fig. 3D) reaching more than 100 copies per full-length genome by passage 6. primers 1634F and 10565R were chosen on each side of the breakpoint (arrows) in order to detect only Dg in the sample, the signal remained at the same level as that of the water-only control (dashed line). qRT-PCR used a primer pair targeting only the full-length genome and the aforementioned primer pair targeting only the Dg genome. mutator viruses have a lower specific infectivity and higher elongation rate (4, 10) however, similar accumulations of full-length genomes were detected from passages 1 to 4 for both viruses. to address this possibility, we cloned Dg into a plasmid, and Dg RNA was synthetized in vitro. qPCR results confirmed that each transcript was robustly expressed in each stable cell line. the number of full-length genomes in high-MOI passages of the SINV-WT (solid line) and SINV-G (dashed line) was assessed. mean and standard errors of the means are shown (n = 3; no significant differences were detected by a two-tailed student t test). the x axis indicates the ratio of Dg/full-length RNA initially transfected. 293T cells were transfected with a fixed amount of full-length SINV-WT (solid line) or SINV-G (dashed line) RNA. we measured the number of viable, full-length genomes that arose from recombination. at 48 h postelectroporation, replicon-G yielded 10 times more infectious virus than its wild-type counterpart. at 16, 24, and 48 h postelectroporation, progeny viruses were quantified by plaque assay. SINV mutator RdRp presents altered replication kinetics at high-MOI passage in cell culture. the siNV mutator (SINV-G) had wild-type-like growth kinetics in one-step growth curves at low (Fig. 1A) and high (Fig. 1B) multiplicities of infection (MOIs), we further assessed its activity over extended passage. data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posttest. data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posttest. the low-molecular-weight band was amplified solely in the sample infected with SINV-G at an MOI of 25. after such treatment, IVT RNA in solution was completely degraded and was not amplified by PCR. we then purified and sequenced this band, which yielded a viral genome. in vitro-transcribed RNA (lane 1) was used as a control. top band corresponds to the full-length genome. an extra low-molecular-weight band is indicated by an asterisk. in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNAs corresponding to full-length (FL) and Dg genomes were used as positive controls for detection. primers located at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the Dg breakpoint allowed the specific detection of Dg. the distance between these primers on a full-length genome was too great to permit full-length genome detection. SINV-G showed a stronger accumulation of Dwt in the earlier passages. these data indicate that SINV-G more rapidly produced and more significantly accumulated naturally occurring defective genomes. in vitro-transcribed RNAs of the full-length genome and Dg were mixed at different ratios. mutator viruses have a lower specific infectivity and higher elongation rate. however, similar accumulations of full-length genomes were detected from passages 1 to 4 for both viruses. we cloned Dg into a plasmid, and Dg RNA was synthetized in vitro. DI of influenza A virus PB2 protein was implicated in the attenuation of full-length virus in vitro. qPCR results confirmed that each transcript was robustly expressed in each stable cell line. qPCR results confirmed that each transcript was robustly expressed in each stable cell line. chikungunya virus replication-defective RNA (CHIK RNA) does not significantly interfere with SINV-WT or SINV-G virus replication compared to replication in infected cells with no additional RNA added (No RNA) no significant differences were detected by a two-tailed student t test. we electroporated BHK-21 cells with two segments of RNA. each of which could not generate viable progeny alone. we then measured the number of viable, full-length genomes that arose from recombination. progeny viruses arising from recombination were quantified by plaque assay. at 16, 24, and 48 h posttransfection, progeny viruses were quantified by plaque assay. fidelity is a critical parameter of virus fitness. mutator SINV-G displayed an earlier drop in titer than its wild-type counterpart. we could invoke the accumulation of full-length genomes bearing deleterious point mutations. mutagenic treatment of LCMV led to a maximum increase in mutation rate of 10-fold while SINV-G possesses a 2-fold-higher mutation rate than the wild-type virus. recombines at a higher rate, we can assume that its replication produces a diverse cloud of defective genomes, heterogeneous in size and breakpoint sites. only a small portion of these would be transmissible to other cells as they require both signals for replication (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome) and encapsidation (nsP1 protein) strong RNA secondary structures present in these areas provoke or facilitate the RdRp jump (25, 36) some regions of SINV genomes bear strong secondary structures involved in processes such as encapsidation (37, 38) however, RNA secondary structure prediction using the mfold software program did not yield any structure of interest when it was applied to the genomic regions around Dg and Dwt breakpoints. the high recombination rates of RNA viruses might be beneficial for viral evolution. however higher recombination rates and a larger production of DI particles are also characteristics of mutator virus infection. these events are implicated in the preferential activation of type I interferon through the binding of cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 as well as in the maturation of dendritic cells."}
