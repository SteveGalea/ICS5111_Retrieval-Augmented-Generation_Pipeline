{"summary": "five members have been reported to infect humans, including 229E, OC43, the newly discovered NL63 and HKU1 and the emerging SARS-CoV. HCoVs infect airways and are responsible for different respiratory diseases. HCoVs account for 15 to 30% of common colds, with only occasional spreading to the lower respiratory tract. DCs express pattern recognition receptors, e.g., toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors. these receptors induce the migration of DCs to the draining lymph nodes and their maturation into antigen-presenting cells. this maturation process determines the ability of DCs to stimulate an adaptive immune response. in vitro infection of monocyte-derived DCs with human HCoV-229E. infected monocytes from same donors were preserved from cytopathic effects. infected monocytes acquired sensitivity to cell death only after a short stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. infected wells were numbered for each virus dilution, allowing us to calculate a TCID50 (26, 45) to perform in vitro infections, cell suspensions of monocytes, Mo-DCs, or CD34-DCs were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with an appropriate volume of virus stock to match the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) all viral stocks were stored at 80\u00b0C in single-use aliquots. titers were determined as the TCID50 with optical microscopic reading. all work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed in an enhanced biosafety level 3 containment laboratory. cells were purified from leukapheresis products collected from patients. cell differentiation was obtained in 5 days as previously described. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD14, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CCR7, allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD83, FITC-conjugated anti-CD14, APC-conjugated anti-CD209 (DC-SIGN), PE-conjugated anti-TRAIL, FITC-con at least 20,000 gated events were collected and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star) the results are expressed as a percentage of positive cells and/or as the mean fluorescence intensity compared to negative controls. the slides were analyzed, and image acquisition was performed using fluorescence microscope using a 40 oil immersion objective lens. the microscopy slide was then placed under an optical microscope for live cell imaging. similar experiments were performed to block apoptosis using hIL-6 (100 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotech) and hIFN- (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) to inhibit death ligand signaling, Mo-DCs were treated during and after infection with either an anti-hTRAIL MAb (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems), a recombinant human Fas-Fc chimera (1 g/ml; dilutions of virus stock ranging from 101 to 108. plates were incubated for 12 h at 37\u00b0C before adding DMEM. plates were incubated for another 6 days and then fixed with 10% FCS. all viral stocks were stored at 80\u00b0C in single-use aliquots. infectious titers were determined as the TCID50 with optical microscopic reading of the cytopathic effect. medium containing 10% FCS in the presence of IL-4 (20 ng/ml; Gentaur Molecule Products, Belgium), and GM-CSF (100 ng/ml; Gentaur Molecule Products, Belgium). monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs was obtained in 5 days as previously described (10). FITC-conjugated anti-CD14, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CCR7, allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD83, FITC-conjugated anti-CD14, APC-conjugated anti-CD209 (DC-SIGN), PE-conjugated anti-TRAIL, FITC-conjugated anti-active caspase-3, at least 20,000 gated events were collected and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star) the results are expressed as a percentage of positive cells and/or as the mean fluorescence intensity compared to negative controls. 100 l of Fluoromount-G was added to the wells (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) the slides were analyzed, and image acquisition was performed using fluorescence microscope using a 40 oil immersion objective lens. the microscopy slide was then placed under an optical microscope for live cell imaging. similar experiments were performed to block apoptosis using hIL-6 (100 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotech) and hIFN- (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) to inhibit death ligand signaling, Mo-DCs were treated during and after infection with either an anti-hTRAIL MAb (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems), a recombinant human Fas-Fc chimera (1 g/ml; monocytes and Mo-DCs expressed high levels of CD13. cytopathic effect in Mo-DCs was assessed by presence of cellular aggregates, large syncytia, and numerous cellular debris. cells were enumerated at the indicated time points by trypan blue exclusion. cells were stained with an anti-CD13 MAb (open line) or an isotypic control (closed line) and analyzed by flow cytometry. the data are representative of three independent experiments. the death of Mo-DCs induced after HCoV-229E infection is associated with caspase-3 activation. we then compared the effects of SARS-CoV, which is much more pathogenic in humans than HCoV-229E. however, no cytopathic effect was induced by SARS-CoV infection in Mo-DCs. monocytes and Mo-DCs are more susceptible to HCoV-229E than monocytes. this was confirmed when viral RNA load was measured by qRT-PCR in cell cultures supernatants. monocytes are more susceptible to viral replication but also to HCoV-229E-induced cytopathic effects in monocyte cultures. infected with HCoV-229E at MOIs of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5. UV-inactivated virus was ineffective at inducing cytopathic effect in Mo-DCs. this suggests that viral replication in infected cells is linked to the cytopathic effect. mo-DCs were incubated or not with anti-CD13 MAb prior to infection with HCoV-229E. cell death was determined by the observation of cytopathic effects. mo-DCs were treated or not with increasing amounts of IFN- prior to infection with HCoV-229E. BDCA-1+-DCs or DC-SIGN+-DCs rapidly died upon HCoV-229E infection. all tested populations of conventional DCs are highly susceptible to HCoV-229E-induced cell death. mo-DCs cultured 16 h in the presence of poly-IC, CD40L, or PGE2+TNF-. mo-DC maturation did not confer resistance to infection. cell death induced by HCoV-229E infection is independent of FasL, TRAIL, and TNF-. we controlled in Jurkat cells that anti-TRAIL, TNF-R/Fc, and FAS/Fc were efficient to block apoptosis induced by their cognate ligands. anti-TRAIL, TNF-R/Fc, and FAS/Fc were efficient to block apoptosis induced by their cognate ligands, i.e., TRAIL, TNF-, and FasL, respectively. mo-DCs were preincubated for 24 h in the presence of a potent broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. after 24 h of culture, cell death was determined by using Dead/Live staining. cytokines produced by monocytes do not account for their resistance to HCoV-229E-induced cell death and cytopathic effects. monocyte culture supernatant did not confer resistance to HCoV-229E-induced cell death and cytopathic effects. monocyte culture supernatant contained 113 pg of IFN-/ml and 31 pg of IFN-/ml. this corresponds to 17 and 5 IU/ml, respectively. all cytokines and chemokines were measured by a multiplex bead-based Luminex assay (mean of three donors), except for IFN- and IFN-. the fold increase for mock-infected versus HCoV-229E-infected cells is also indicated. monocytes incubated for 24 h in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. cells were stained with an anti-CD14 MAb or anti-CD11c. cells were stained with an anti-CD14 MAb or anti-CD11c. monocytes treated with IL-4 alone also became susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. HCoV-229E induces massive cytopathic effects in Mo-DC cultures. in vitro susceptibility of humans to infection by these viruses is not yet known. cytopathic effect in Mo-DCs was assessed by presence of cellular aggregates, large syncytia, and numerous cellular debris. no cytopathic effect was observed when HCoV-229E virus was UV inactivated. time-lapse microscopy recorded on infected Mo-DC cultures. in HCoV-229E-infected Mo-DCs and monocytes by cytometry. cells were stained with an anti-CD13 MAb (open line) or an isotypic control (closed line) and analyzed by flow cytometry. the data are representative of three different donors. HCoV-229E (but not SARS-CoV) induces massive cytopathic effects in Mo-DC cultures, whereas monocytes do not exhibit this unusual susceptibility to infection. mo-DCs, but not monocytes, are highly susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. this was confirmed when viral RNA load was measured by qRT-PCR in cell cultures supernatants. the viral RNA load increased during the first 8 h postinfection in both Mo-DCs and monocytes, thus demonstrating viral replication. however, HCoV-229E never induced massive cytopathic effects in monocyte cultures, even when performing infections with higher MOIs. UV-inactivated virus was ineffective at inducing cytopathic effect in Mo-DCs. HCoV-229E-induced cytopathic effects are dependent on viral entry. cytopathic effects and cell death depend on viral entry. cell death was determined by the observation of cytopathic effects and the formation of syncytia by bright-field microscopy. mo-DCs were treated or not with increasing amounts of IFN- prior to infection with HCoV-229E. percentages of cells expressing spike viral protein or activated caspase-3 were determined by flow cytometry. both BDCA-1+-DCs or DC-SIGN+-DCs rapidly died upon HCoV-229E infection. all tested populations of conventional DCs are highly susceptible to HCoV-229E-induced cell death. mo-DCs cultured 16 h in the presence of poly-IC, CD40L, or PGE2+TNF- for 16 h before infection with HCoV-229E. mo-DC maturation did not confer resistance to infection. cell death induced by HCoV-229E infection is independent of FasL, TRAIL, and TNF-. /Fc were efficient to block apoptosis induced by their cognate ligands. we controlled in Jurkat cells that Z-VAD-FMK effectively blocked the apoptosis induced by their cognate ligands. if HCoV-229E-infected Mo-DCs activate caspases, cell death does not require caspase activation. cytokines produced by monocytes do not account for their resistance to HCoV-229E-induced cell death and cytopathic effects. specific cytokines such as IFN-/ and IL-6 could provide resistance to viral infection. monocyte culture supernatant did not confer resistance to HCoV-229E-induced cell death. resistance of monocytes to HCoV-229E-induced cell death is probably not mediated by a soluble factor but rather relies on an intrinsic property of this cell type that is lost during differentiation into Mo-DCs. all cytokines and chemokines were measured by a multiplex bead-based Luminex assay. the fold increase for mock-infected versus HCoV-229E-infected cells is also indicated. the results correspond to the mean of three donors. monocytes were treated for 24 h with GM-CSF, IL-4, or both combined. after 24 h, the cells were immunostained for spike glycoprotein and active caspase-3 expression. HCoV-229E susceptibility is early acquired during monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs. monocytes treated with IL-4 alone also became susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. cytopathic effects were much less pronounced. a similar trend was observed when treating monocytes with GM-CSF alone. the infection and killing of DCs is dependent on viral entry and replication. pretreating cells with blocking antibodies against TNF-, FAS-L, TRAIL, and IFN-/ or with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not protect infected Mo-DCs from death. we therefore suggest that cell death induced by HCoV-229E is not an apoptotic process but rather a direct consequence of virus replication and viral spike protein expression on the cell surface cytopathic effects depend on the expression of an as-yet-unknown restriction factor or the absence of a cellular factor increasing susceptibility to viral infection. killing DCs can be an efficient viral strategy to delay or prevent the establishment of adaptive immune responses. if it happens in vivo in human infection, this could delay the induction of an adaptive immune response. DCs infected by Legionella pneumophila undergo apoptosis to restrict bacterial replication and spreading. this suggests that signaling events induced by IL-4 and GM-CSF are responsible for monocyte sensitization to HCoV-229E infection. this suggests that signaling events induced by IL-4 and GM-CSF are responsible for monocyte sensitization to infection. monocytes obtained by adhering peripheral blood mononuclear cells quickly differentiate into macrophages, as acknowledged by the authors themselves. this could account for their susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection, whereas monocytes positively selected by magnetic beads are resistant. this could explain the resistance of monocytes since IL-6 is an IFN-like cytokine with antiviral properties. however, neutralizing IL-6 in infected monocyte cultures did not confer suscept HCoV-229E infects and destroys human Mo-DCs rapidly, whereas monocytes are resistant. the next step of this work is to identify the molecular basis of the DC susceptibility and monocyte resistance to HCoV-229E."}
