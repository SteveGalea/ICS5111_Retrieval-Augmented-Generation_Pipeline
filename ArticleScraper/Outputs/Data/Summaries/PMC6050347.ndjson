{"summary": "cAMP is the heat-stable factor mediating the intracellular function of hormones epinephrine and glucagon. the discovery of cAMP led to the \u201csecond messenger\u201d theory. this theory has revolutionized the understanding of cellular signaling cascades. cAMP effectors all share a common cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain. the bacterial cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is evolutionary conserved with an ancient ancestor. the cNB domain can act as a molecular switch for controlling various cellular activities. phosphate-sugar moiety of the nucleotide relieves steric hindrance from the hinge. this interaction allows a COOH-terminal \u201clid\u201d to move closer to the -barrel core thus folding on top of the nucleotide base. three major types of proteins are known to assist in the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in cells. these regulatory systems include ACs, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) the family of mammalian ACs has grown to encompass nine closely related membrane-bound enzymes. the dimerization of the two catalytic subunits is highly dependent on the presence of an activator of AC, such as Gs, that binds to the two subunits to regulate the formation of the active catalytic core. the regulation, as well as the level of each AC isoform, differs in specific tissues (395). Phosphodiesterase Opposing the action of ACs, another group of molecules that are also responsible for cAMP compartmentalization are PDEs. these enzymes degrade cAMP to 5\u2032-AMP, restoring the basal cAMP state after activation of ACs (440, 870). the activation of PDEs is vital for regulating the strength and duration of the cAMP signal within a cell. AKAPs are scaffolding proteins that act to assist in the spatiotemporal arrangement of pertinent components of cAMP signaling. AKAPs are key regulators of cAMP signaling by assembling member-specific sets of cAMP effectors, ACs, PDEs, kinases, phosphatases, G proteins. the occurrence of these multifunctional signalosomes appears to be cell-type specific depending on the expression of AKAP members. AKAPs assemble localized signalosomes positioning relevant downstream effectors near respective substrate proteins to propagate downstream signaling. cAMP acts on downstream effectors such as PKA, EPAC or ion-gated channels. in mammals, at least five families of cAMP effector proteins are known. the cAMP effectors all share a common cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain that is evolutionary conserved with an ancient ancestor: the bacterial cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (496). increase in intracellular levels of cAMP results in activation of cAMP sensors. cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP. cyclic nucleotide receptor involved in sperm function (CRIS) a single ubiquitous signaling molecule could effectively integrate the myriad of extracellular stimuli into such a diverse array of responses. the accepted hypothesis for this question, still held today, was proposed in the early 80s by Brunton and colleagues. first group of molecules responsible for regulation of the cAMP signal are cAMP manufacturing enzymes, the AC family. the family of mammalian ACs has grown to encompass nine closely related membrane-bound enzymes that convert ATP into cAMP and pyrophosphate upon activation by regulatory proteins including Gs subunits. the most common regulators of ACs are Gs and Gi subunits being stimulatory and inhibitory. other modulators of AC activity include, but are not limited to, G, calcium and calmodulin, protein kinase C (PKC), and PKA (69, 132, 181, 241, 459, 507, 574, 979, 1009, 1015, 1215) cAMP compartmentalization is driven by differences existing between kinetics of individual PDE members and regulation by various modulators. eight of these families are found to hydrolyze cAMP, including PDE4 which has received much attention in the recent years. structurally diverse family of AKAPs tether relevant signaling components to specific subcellular organelles or regions. AKAPs are scaffolding proteins that act to assist in the spatiotemporal arrangement of pertinent components of cAMP signaling. AKAPs are key regulators of cAMP signaling by assembling member-specific sets of cAMP effectors. AKAPs assemble localized signalosomes positioning relevant downstream effectors to propagate downstream signaling. feedback mechanisms activate PDEs to halt signaling by degradation of the second messenger. cAMP manufacturing enzymes are the AC family. the general structure of all membrane-bound members of the AC family includes two highly conserved catalytic regions (C1 and C2) that dimerize to form the active catalytic core and two hydrophobic six-transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2) that firmly anchor the enzyme to the lipid membrane. the regulation, as well as the level of each AC isoform, differs in specific tissues (395). Phosphodiesterase Opposing the action of ACs, another group of molecules responsible for cAMP compartmentalization are PDEs. these enzymes degrade cAMP to 5\u2032-AMP, restoring the basal cAMP state after activation of ACs. the presence of this enzymatic family is highly conserved through evolution. AKAPs are scaffolding proteins that act to assist in the spatiotemporal arrangement of pertinent components of cAMP signaling. AKAPs are key regulators of cAMP signaling by assembling member-specific signaling molecules. cAMP effectors, ACs, PDEs, kinases, phosphatases, G proteins, and ion channels required to effectively optimize cAMP signaling at specific subcellular locales. AKAPs assemble localized signalosomes positioning relevant downstream effectors near respective substrate proteins to propagate downstream signaling. feedback mechanisms activate PDEs to halt signaling by degradation of the second messenger. the tetrameric PKA holoenzyme is composed of two separate subunits, two catalytic (C) subunits that phosphorylate substrates and two regulatory (R) subunits that bind cAMP. the tetrameric PKA holoenzyme is composed of two separate subunits, two catalytic (C) subunits that phosphorylate substrates and two regulatory (R) subunits that bind cAMP two independent research groups identified a novel family of cAMP sensors challenging the long-accepted dogma for cAMP signaling. one group led by MIT aimed to identify \u201ca novel protein kinase A-like molecule\u201d involved in the induction of Fos-like protein in striatal neurons responding to dopaminergic stimulation by screening novel brain-enriched genes. the origin of EPAC is evolutionally more contemporary than that of PKA. EPAC proteins consist of separate R and C subunits encoded by distinct genes. only one gene, EPAC2, with both CNB domains is found in lower animals. the mouse Epac1 gene Rapgef3 is located on chromosome 15 (15qF1) and has three validated transcript variants in the NCBI database. transcript variant 1 encodes the longest Epac1 isoform 1 with 926 amino acids. variant 2 of the gene encodes a putative Epac2A2, differing by omitting exon 7 and the associated 18 amino acid sequence sandwiched between the CNB-A and DEP domain (424). the transcript variant 3 produces the Epac2B isoform, which is specifically expressed in the mouse adrenal glands (766). mRNAs encode shorter polypeptide chains (867\u2013791 amino acids) without the CNB-A at the NH2 terminus, compared with EPAC2A. studies in rodents suggest the expression of Epac1 and Epac2 are regulated developmentally. Epac1 and Epac2 protein levels in rat brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons at different stages of development reveal a developmental regulation of Epac in the rat nervous system. in humans, EPAC1 mRNA is detected in all tissues with high levels in hippocampus, thyroid, kidney, breast and adipose tissues. high levels of EPAC2 mRNA are detected in all 45 tissue types examined. EPAC2 and EPAC share a Dishevelled/Egl-10/pleckstrin (DEP) domain. additional CNB domain expressed NH2 terminal to the DEP domain is recognized in full-length EPAC2 (FIGURE 2). biochemical analyses using isolated recombinant proteins suggest that apo-EPAC exists in an autoinhibitory state. isolated EPAC2 CNB-B domain is sufficient to block GEF activity of the EPAC2 catalytic half (228) a construct shorter by a mere 11 COOH-terminal amino acids (EPAC1-NR149\u2013328) is not. this observation led to the identification of a conserved sequence motif 321VLVLE325 required for the autoinhibition of EPAC1. the last two turns of the hinge helix dissolve to form a loop, which allows the catalytic core to rotate 90\u00b0 sideways away from the regulatory lobe. cAMP activation shares a similar mechanism, namely hinge motion, with other cyclic nucleotide binding proteins. cAMP-mediated activation of Rap1 requires the DEP domain (834, 845) no active EPAC X-ray structure containing the DEP domain is available. cAMP binding primes the DEP domain for membrane association. cAMP binding leads to a reduction in the dynamics of a helical hairpin directly involved in the interaction with Rap1. this suggests that cAMP binding relieves steric hindrance imposed by the regulatory lobe to the catalytic lobe, but also may contribute directly to modulate EPAC-Rap1 interaction. cAMP induces conformational changes within the DEP domain and/or a domain rearrangement between the DEP and CNB-B domain cAMP binding was associated with increased dynamics for the region. cAMP promotes transition from a \u201cclosed\u201d inactive conformation to an \u201copen\u201d active conformation. cGMP is present in a syn conformation while free in solution and switches to an anti-conformation in the EPAC1-bound state. first intracellular cAMP sensor developed was a PKA-based indicator in which the R and C subunits were labeled with a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-compatible dyes. binding of cAMP promoted dissociation of the holoenzyme complex and abolishment of FRET signal (2). cAMP using ICUE1 was designed by sandwiching the full-length EPAC1 between enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP) increased intracellular cAMP in response to isoproterenol or forskolin treatment led to a reversible decrease in FRET signal. eYFP and eCFP fused directly to the NH2 and COOH terminal of the CNB of EPAC1, EPAC2, or PKA RII respectively. they showed that a single CNB was sufficient to generate detectable FRET signal and a significantly larger signal amplitude and activation speed could be achieved using constructs based on the EPAC1 CNB. these sensors allowed rapid imaging of -adrenergic receptor-induced cAMP signals with high speed 40 Ca2+-sensitive ACs and PDEs may be responsible for cAMP oscillations in electrically excitable insulin-secreting MIN6 -cells. a calcium indicator and cAMP FRET sensor showed that thrombin treatment prompted a transient, Ca2+-dependent but Gi-independent decrease of cAMP levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells. thrombin-evoked decrease in cAMP is mediated by Ca2+-dependent inhibition of AC6 (1113) thrombin induces a delayed increase in cAMP in HUVECs via a Ca2+-dependent activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and synthesis of prostacyclin. cAMP production mediated by different receptors and AC isoforms is not uniformly distributed between lipid raft and non- basal cAMP levels appear significantly higher in non-raft domains. pharmacological inhibition of AC activity reduced basal cAMP level detected by EPAC2-CAAX, but not EPAC2-MyrPalm and EPAC2-camps. results confirm compartmentalization of cAMP signaling associated with lipid raft, and non-lipid raft, membrane domains. IgG from 50 control patients and 32 anti-1-ECII-negative patients had no effect on cAMP generation. effect of \"high-activator\" IgG could be blocked specifically with synthetic peptides corresponding to the second extracellular 1-receptor loop (1-ECII) but not by 1-ECII peptides. transgenic mice expressing the cAMP sensor under control of a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken -actin promoter (CAG-EPAC1-camps) were generated and utilized to study thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-mediated cAMP signaling. rapid internalization of TSH receptors was ascertained after stimulation where these receptors continually activate Gs and AC to sustain cAMP production intracellularly. study demonstrates that transgenic mice can be crossbred with other genetic murine models for dissecting functions of various GPCRs under physiological conditions. a transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor by fusing EPAC1-camps with phospholamban (PLN, PLB) was generated as a relevant model to directly monitor subcellular cAMP dynamics in the context of cardiac disease. the cAMP sensor is susceptible to photobleaching, as well as pH and ionic strength variations (468, 715) these properties limit the cellular applications of these sensors. development of cAMP sensors with increased photostability and reduced ion sensitivity are crucial in obtaining FRET signals which reliably mirror the actual cellular cAMP levels. eCFP/eYFP FRET pair of the established EPAC1-based biosensor was replaced by Cerulean/Citrine fluorophores. the new sensor demonstrates a twofold enhanced dynamic range, is less sensitivity to fluctuations in ion concentration, and provides more reliable live cAMP concentration measurements in metabolically active cells under various physiological conditions. cAMP sensor mTurquoise-EPAC (CD, DEP)-cp173Venus-Venus has been constructed by replacing the eCFP donor with mTurquoise, a high quantum yield and single-exponentially decaying CFP variant (352) this new sensor has an increased FRET span optimal for both FLIM and ratiometric detections, demonstrating 35% increased change in lifetime as detected by frequency-domain FLIM measurements. the eYFP (citrine) was replaced with a circularly permuted version (citrine-cp229) to maximize the BRET ratio upon binding cAMP by twofold. CAMYEL (cAMP sensor using YFP-EPAC-RLuc) overcomes many disadvantages associated with the requirement for photo-excitation of the donor molecule. the CAMYEL-based BRET sensor is capable of distinguishing between EPAC agonists, partial agonists, and super agonists. a thiobarbituric acid derivative was identified that allosterically inhibits EPAC1 activity through binding the hinge region of EPAC1 (111, 112) cAMP exerted its action in eukaryotic cells largely through the ubiquitously expressed PKA. but over the years, accumulating evidence suggested not all cellular effects were mediated by PKA exclusively. a breakthrough would not occur until 1998 when two independent research groups identified a novel family of cAMP sensors challenging the long-accepted dogma for cAMP signaling. Rap1 is known to be activated by cAMP in various cell types (20, 1078) this phosphorylation site is not required for cAMP-dependent activation of Rap1 (20, 229). EPAC1 is a novel cAMP sensor that mediates the PKA-independent Rap1 activation in response to cAMP. vertebrates have two EPAC genes, EPAC1 and EPAC2. cAMP binding affinity is very low at 87 M, significantly above the physiological concentrations of cAMP. cAMP binding affinity is weaker than that of the second CNB site (CNB-B) at 1.2 M. hyperglycemia stimulates transcription and translation of Epac1. the human EPAC1 promoter also contains a hypoxia responsive element (ACGTG) site located at 1232 to 1228. transcript variant 1 (6,239 bp) encodes EPAC1A with 923 amino acids. transcript variants 2 (5,773 bp) and 3 (6,003 bp) encode the same EPAC1B isoform consisting of a shorter polypeptide chain of 881 amino acids. blot analyses of Epac2 also reveal high levels of full-length transcript in the pituitary gland and a truncated transcript corresponding to Epac2C in liver. studies in rodents suggest that expressions of Epac1 and Epac2 are regulated developmentally. mRNA expression increases moderately after birth, reaching maximum expression levels at 3 wk of age in all described tissues. both proteins contain an NH2-terminal regulatory region and a COOH-terminal catalytic region (510) the catalytic region of EPAC is characterized by a RAS exchange motif (REM), a RAS-association (RA) domain, and successive CDC25 homology domain (also known as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras-like small GTPases [RasGEF] domain) isolated cAMP binding domains from EPAC1 and EPAC2 exert much weaker affinity towards cAMP (87 M) this extra CNB-A of EPAC2 exerts much weaker affinity towards cAMP (87 M) than that of CNB-B (1.2 M) this extra CNB-A of EPAC2 exerts much weaker affinity towards cAMP (87 M) than that of CNB-B (1.2 M) equent determination of the three-dimensional structure complex (EPAC2305:Sp-cAMPS:Rap1B) reveals important conformational changes induced by cAMP and Rap1 binding during EPAC activation. cAMP-mediated EPAC activation is centered around a localized hinge motion, during which the hinge helix swings toward the core of the CNB domain bringing the switchboard closer to the cAMP binding pocket. structure of apo-EPAC2 and EPAC2 in complex with cAMP and Rap1 shown are based on PDB files 2BYV and 3CF6, respectively. cAMP-induced membrane translocation of EPAC1 is essential for efficient cAMP-mediated activation of Rap1 at the plasma membrane and requires the DEP domain (834, 845) however, no active EPAC X-ray structure containing the DEP domain is available. cAMP binding leads to a reduction in the dynamics of a helical hairpin directly involved in the interaction with Rap1. this observation suggests that cAMP binding relieves steric hindrance imposed by the regulatory lobe to the catalytic lobe. this observation suggests that cAMP binding may contribute directly to modulate EPAC-Rap1 interaction. amide hydrogens exchange rapidly at the interface between CNB-A and CNB-B, indicating this region is highly dynamic and flexible in solution. cAMP promotes the transition from a \u201cclosed\u201d inactive conformation to an \u201copen\u201d active conformation. cGMP is present in a syn conformation while cGMP is present in a syn conformation. ligand-bound EPAC1 CNB and the ligand binding affinities between cAMP and cGMP are not significantly different. a key difference observed between cAMP and cGMP are the opposing effects on the dynamic profile of the hinge helix. a key difference observed between cAMP and cGMP are the opposing effects on the dynamic profile of the hinge helix. ally encoded cAMP sensors can be applied in a wide variety of cells conveniently via transfection (1178) first-generation EPAC-based FRET biosensors EPAC-based FRET biosensors were first reported independently by three different research groups in 2004 (244, 768, 835) a similar biosensor was constructed and shown to be functionally active in eliciting robust FRET decreases in response to various cAMP-elevating agents when expressed in mammalian cells. further optimization of the sensor was conducted by deleting the membrane associating DEP domain (amino acids 1\u2013148) and introducing mutations (T781A, F782A), which disrupt the binding of Rap1 to prevent elevation of basal Rap1 activity with overexpression of the sensor. cAMP and cAMP signaling pathways are interconnected spatially and temporally in eukaryote cells. a close temporal and causal interrelationship between the enhancement of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP levels was observed in the insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. thrombin-mediated regulation of ca2+ and cAMP signals prompted a transient, Ca2+-dependent but Gi-independent decrease of cAMP levels in isoproterenol-primed human umbilical vein endothelial cells. thrombin induces a delayed increase in cAMP in HUVECs via a Ca2+-dependent activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and synthesis of raft or non-raft membrane domains were applied to monitor global and local cAMP production near the plasma membrane. Isoproterenol-induced activation of the -AR produced similar FRET signal changes for EPAC2-MyrPalm and EPAC2-camps. the response reported by EPAC2-CAAX was significantly smaller. anti-1-Abs prevalence in a cohort of previously antibody-typed patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) revealed IgG from 22 patients previously tested positive with anti-1-Abs targeting the second extracellular 1-receptor loop (anti-1-ECII) induced significant cAMP productions. cAMP sensor-based assay is highly sensitive and capable of distinguishing high or low activator anti-1-Abs that recognize different epitopes within fluctuating active 1-receptor conformations (767). transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the cAMP sensor under the control of a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken -actin promoter (CAG-EPAC1-camps) were generated and utilized to study thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-mediated cAMP signaling transgenic mice can be crossbred with other genetic murine models for dissecting functions of various GPCRs under physiological conditions. a transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor by fusing EPAC1-camps with phospholamban (PLN, PLB) was generated as a relevant model to directly monitor subcellular cAMP dynamics in context of cardiac disease. PAC1-camps senor have been generated and applied to monitor intracellular cAMP dynamics in neurons of isolated living fly brains responding to stimulation of neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), a critical hormone for maintaining normal circadian rhythmicity in flies. new generations EPAC-based cAMP sensors offer several major advantages including being genetically encoded as single-chain proteins capable of being conveniently introduced into cells, tissues, and whole organisms. a panel of constructs consisting of different donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins were systematically tested. for radiometric and sensitized emission FRET detection, replacing YFP by Venus, a variant with significantly lower pKa and pH sensitivity (751), and varying the orientation of Venus to CFP by substituting the YFP acceptor with a circularly permuted (cp) mutants (43, 752, 1034), such as cp173Venus, resulte the new Cerulean/Citrine-based sensor demonstrates a twofold enhanced dynamic range, is less sensitivity to fluctuations in ion concentration, and provides more reliable live cAMP concentration measurements in metabolically active cells. mTurquoise-EPAC(CD, DEP)-cp173Venus-Venus has been constructed by replacing the eCFP donor with mTurquoise. improvements are remarkable with maximum FRET ratio changes around 100% while also performing quite well in FLIM experiments. replacement of the fluorescent acceptors with non-emitting (dark) dedicated variants provides additional improvements for dedicated single-wavelength FLIM acquisition that displays near-doubling of fluorescence lifetime. the enhancement of cAMP by S1P is mediated by the S1P2 receptor and heterotrimeric G13 protein, acting independent of Ca2+ and exhibiting resistance to pertussis toxin (476). a similar EPAC BRET cAMP sensor based on ICUEs was also developed and used to characterize the activity of putative ligands of the human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). an indicator for cAMP using Epac1 (ICUE1) was designed by sandwiching the full-length EPAC1 between enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP) increased intracellular cAMP in response to isoproterenol or forskolin treatment led to a reversible decrease in FRET signal. a single CNB was sufficient to generate detectable FRET signal. a significantly larger signal amplitude and activation speed could be achieved using constructs based on the EPAC1 CNB. these sensors allowed rapid imaging of -adrenergic receptor-induced cAMP signals with high speed 40 m/s throughout the entire cell body of hippocampal neurons. 2+ and cAMP levels following membrane depolarization were observed in the insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. results suggest periodic activation and inactivation of Ca2+-sensitive ACs and PDEs may be responsible for Ca2+-dependent cAMP oscillations in electrically excitable MIN6 -cells. mechanistic analysis suggests the apparent thrombin-evoked decrease in cAMP is mediated by Ca2+-dependent inhibition of AC6 (1113). thrombin induces a delayed increase in cAMP in HUVECs via a Ca2+-dependent activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and synthesis of prostacyclin, which stimulates Gs-coupled prostacyclin receptors (1112). on of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion decreased cAMP responses associated with -AR stimulation in all three subcellular locations. pharmacological inhibition of AC activity reduced basal cAMP level detected by EPAC2-CAAX, but not EPAC2-MyrPalm and EPAC2-camps. results confirm compartmentalization of cAMP signaling associated with lipid raft and non-lipid raft, membrane domains. anti-1-Abs targeting the second extracellular 1-receptor loop (anti-1-ECII) induced significant cAMP productions. IgG from 50 control patients and 32 anti-1-ECII-negative patients had no effect on cAMP generation. effect could be blocked specifically with synthetic peptides corresponding to the second extracellular 1-receptor loop (1-ECII) promoter and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-driven gene delivery system allows real-time examinations of the crosstalk between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in living tissue (706). transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the EPAC1-camps cAMP sensor under the control of a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken -actin promoter (CAG-EPAC1-camps) were generated and utilized to study thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-mediated study demonstrates that transgenic mice can be crossbred with other genetic murine models for dissecting functions of various GPCRs under physiological conditions. a transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor by fusing EPAC1-camps with phospholamban (PLN, PLB) was generated as a relevant model to directly monitor subcellular cAMP dynamics in the context of cardiac disease. EPAC-based cAMP sensors offer several major advantages including being genetically encoded as single-chain proteins capable of being conveniently introduced into cells, tissues, and whole organisms. cAMP sensors are susceptible to photobleaching, as well as pH and ionic strength variations (468, 715) these properties limit the cellular applications of these sensors considering that it is often a common necessity to observe physiological responses within a considerable time window. eCFP/eYFP FRET pair of the established EPAC1-based biosensor was replaced by Cerulean/Citrine fluorophores. the new sensor demonstrates a twofold enhanced dynamic range, is less sensitivity to fluctuations in ion concentration, and provides more reliable live cAMP concentration measurements in metabolically active cells under various physiological conditions. cAMP sensor mTurquoise-EPAC (CD, DEP)-cp173Venus-Venus has been constructed by replacing the eCFP donor with mTurquoise. this new sensor has an increased FRET span optimal for both FLIM and ratiometric detections. the new sensor has an increased FRET span optimal for both FLIM and ratiometric detections. cAMP sensor was developed using cFP-EPAC1-YFP (835) as a template by replacing the donor ECFP used in the FRET sensor with a Renilla luciferase (476). CAMYEL (cAMP sensor using YFP-EPAC-RLuc) overcomes many disadvantages associated with the requirement for photo-excitation. cAMP signaling pathway can distinguish between agonists, super agonists and super agonists. a thiobarbituric acid derivative was identified that allosterically inhibits EPAC1 activity through binding the hinge region of EPAC1 (111, 112) low intracellular cAMP levels favor distribution of EPAC1 towards the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton (108, 845) low intracellular cAMP levels favor distribution of EPAC1 towards the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton (108, 845) cellular targeting sequences and binding partners of EPAC1 and EPAC2 are shown. mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), phosphatidic acid binding motif (PA-B) and nuclear pore localization sequence (NPLS) of EPAC1 and their interacting domains are depicted by arrows. EPAC1-ERM binding does not require cAMP (i.e., an active EPAC1 conformation) knockdown of ezrin, but not radixin or moesin, inhibits cell spreading induced by EPAC activation in A549 cells. colocalization and functional analyses further define radixin acting as an integrated scaffold for EPAC1 and PKA through FERM and helical domains (FIGURE 5), respectively. radixin acting as an integrated scaffold for EPAC1 and PKA through FERM and helical domains (FIGURE 5), respectively, and generating functional signalosomes at specific cellular loci to mediate TSH-induced cell proliferation in thyroid cells. GRK2 modulates cAMP signaling by phosphorylating -ARs. this leads to the recruitment of arrestins to block reassociation of G proteins. phosphorylation of EPAC1 by GRK2 inhibits translocation of EPAC1 to the PM. interaction between EPAC1 and TGF-RI requires intact kinase activity of TGF-RI and is independent of the cAMP-binding domain of EPAC1. ectopic overexpression of EPAC1 inhibits TGF-1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation. a recent study using EPAC1 knockout mice suggests that EPAC1 positively modulates TGF- signaling in boosting Treg-mediated immunosuppression. deletion of EPAC1 leads to increased SMAD7 expression, while reducing SMAD4 expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation in response to TGF- treatment in T cells (16). cAMP/EPAC1 selectively stimulated PLC- signaling, but not PLC- or PLC-, through activation of a specific Rap GTPase isoform, Rap2B. a more recent study identified five proteins as potential EPAC1 interaction partners in a HEK293 cell line stably transfected with Flag-EPAC1. studies based on EPAC1 deletion mutations suggest that the RA domain of EPAC1 was critical for mediating the interaction with Ran-GTP and RanBP2 proteins. this RA-dependent EPAC1-Ran interaction was also determined to be required for efficient EPAC1-induced Rap1 activation. this suggests that nuclear localization of EPAC1 may facilitate Rap1 activation in response to elevated levels of cAMP (620) structural modeling reveals that the nuclear pore localization motif is blocked by the CNB-A domain in EPAC2A, countering nuclear envelope association of EPAC2. a naturally occurring EPAC2 variant, EPAC2B, that lacks the CNB-A domain is targeted to the nuclear fraction in a similar fashion as EPAC1. interaction between EPAC1 and MT suppresses EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activity (686) association of LC1 or LC2 enhances EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activation (94, 381) these results reveal a linkage between cAMP-mediated EPAC signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics. mitochondrial EPAC1 signaling is correlated and important for centrosome positioning under stress conditions. further studies are required to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological functions of this EPAC1-mediated regulation for centrosome positioning. deletion of EPAC1 is cardioprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo (289). activation of EPAC1 by 007-AM stimulates Ca2+ exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrion by promoting the formation of a Ca2+-handling macromolecular complex. RA domain is expendable for cAMP-induced PM translocation of EPAC2A. deletion of DEP domain in EPAC2A leads to increased basal membrane and granule localization regardless of cAMP levels. functional analyses suggest EPAC2 and Piccolo form a signaling complex to mediate cAMP-induced, PKA-independent exocytosis (FIGURE 6). overexpression of a Rim2 deletion mutant containing the EPAC2-binding domain disrupts endogenous interactions between EPAC2 and Rim2 and inhibits cAMP/EPAC2-mediated exocytosis. residues 351\u2013458 within CNBD-B of EPAC2 and residues 859\u2013881 within NBF-1 of SUR1 (1199). this direct interaction between EPAC2 and SUR1 may be responsible for EPAC-mediated inhibition of the KATP (495) and for PKA-independent cAMP-induced granule priming in pancreatic -cells (271) cAMP-potentiated fusion events in the first phase of glucose-induced exocytosis were markedly abridged in EPAC2/ mice (957). cAMP-potentiated fusion events in the first phase of glucose-induced exocytosis were markedly abridged in EPAC2/ mice (957). EPAC2 signalosomes at other cellular loci Similar to EPAC1, EPAC2 has also been shown to interact and colocalize with LC2 or MAP1A in PC12 cells (653). Activation of EPAC2 stimulated the phosphorylation of syntabulin, a microtubule-associated protein that attaches syntaxin-1 to microtubules and kinesin I. two putative cAMP-responsive signalosomes appear to produce sequestered cAMP pools near hepatocyte plasma membranes. cAMP, in addition to directly activating EPAC1, is crucial in controlling EPAC1\u2019s subcellular targeting (108, 834, 845). cAMP-regulated subcellular EPAC1 targeting may play a role in the apparent cell-cycle-dependent distribution of EPAC1. high intracellular cAMP concentrations enhance membrane association of EPAC1 (834, 845, 962) protein binding partners of EPAC1 and EPAC2 and their interacting domains are shown by arrows. in addition, protein binding partners of EPAC1 and EPAC2 are shown by arrows. EPAC1-ERM binding does not require cAMP (i.e., an active EPAC1 conformation) knockdown of ezrin, but not radixin or moesin, inhibits cell spreading induced by EPAC activation in A549 cells and HUVECs. the ability of EPAC1 to interact with ERMs provides possible mechanisms for precise targeting of EPAC1 with upstream effectors at the PM. this association is attributed to the ERM-binding phosphoprotein-50 (EBP50), also known as the 2-adrenergic receptor (2-AR) GRK2 modulates cAMP signaling by phosphorylating -ARs. this leads to the recruitment of arrestins to block reassociation of G proteins. phosphorylation of EPAC1 by GRK2 inhibits agonist-induced translocation of EPAC1 to the PM (FIGURE 5). a hydrophobic section (residues 436\u2013460) of PDE3B is responsible for binding to P84 (FIGURE 5) this PDE3B-based signalosome integrates EPAC1 and PI3K signaling permitting dynamic cAMP-dependent regulation of cell adhesion, spreading, and tubule formation in human arterial endothelial cells (HAECs) EPAC1 knockout mice suggest that EPAC1 positively modulates TGF- signaling in boosting Treg-mediated immunosuppression. deletion of EPAC1 leads to increased SMAD7 expression, while reducing SMAD4 expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation. perinuclear EPAC1-containing signalosome positions PLC- in close proximity to a specific pool of phospholipid substrates. cAMP/EPAC1 selectively stimulated PLC- signaling, but not PLC- or PLC-, through activation of a specific Rap GTPase isoform, Rap2B. based on EPAC1 deletion mutations, the RA domain of EPAC1 was critical for mediating the interaction with Ran-GTP and RanBP2 proteins. this RA-dependent interaction was also determined to be required for efficient EPAC1-induced Rap1 activation. this suggests that nuclear localization of EPAC1 may facilitate Rap1 activation in response to elevated levels of cAMP (620) a naturally occurring EPAC2 variant, EPAC2B, that lacks the CNB-A domain is targeted to the nuclear fraction in a similar fashion as EPAC1 (36, 811) a more recent study further supports that interaction between EPAC1 and importin 1 may contribute to dynamic partitioning of EPAC1 between the PM and NM (38). interaction between EPAC1 and MT suppresses EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activity (686), association of LC1 or LC2 enhances EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activation (94, 381) these results reveal a dynamic linkage between cAMP-mediated EPAC signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics. studies in HUVECs confirm that EPAC1 colocalizes with MTs. the MT and actin cytoskeleton network is critical for mitochondrial dynamics and positioning (833). mitochondrial EPAC1-mediated signaling is likely to participate in MT-associated mitochondrial functions as EPAC1 is also known to localize to the mitochondria. -AM stimulates Ca2+ exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrion by promoting the formation of a macromolecular complex composed of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75) the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) receptor 1 (IP3R1) between the ER and the mitochondrion interface (FIG EPAC1-ERM binding does not require cAMP (i.e., an active EPAC1 conformation) knockdown of ezrin, but not radixin or moesin, inhibits cell spreading induced by EPAC activation in A549 cells and HUVECs. functional analyses further define radixin acting as an integrated scaffold for EPAC1 and PKA through FERM and helical domains (FIGURE 5), respectively. the ability of EPAC1 to interact with ERMs provides potential mechanisms for precise targeting of EPAC1 with upstream effectors at the PM. this association is attributed to the 2-adrenergic receptor (2-AR) GRK2 modulates cAMP signaling by phosphorylating -ARs. this leads to the recruitment of arrestins to block reassociation of G proteins. phosphorylation of EPAC1 by GRK2 inhibits agonist-induced translocation of EPAC1 to the PM. NH2 terminal of PDE3B (residues 1\u201325) interacts with EPAC1. a hydrophobic section (residues 436\u2013460) of PDE3B is responsible for binding to P84 (FIGURE 5) this PDE3B-based signalosome integrates EPAC1 and PI3K signaling permitting dynamic cAMP-dependent regulation. a recent study using EPAC1 knockout mice suggests that EPAC1 positively modulates TGF- signaling in boosting Treg-mediated immunosuppression. deletion of EPAC1 leads to increased SMAD7 expression, while reducing SMAD4 expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation in response to TGF- treatment in T cells (16). perinuclear EPAC1-containing signalosome positions PLC- in close proximity to a specific pool of phospholipid substrates. cAMP/EPAC1 selectively stimulated PLC- signaling, but not PLC- or PLC- through activation of a specific Rap GTPase isoform, Rap2B. studies based on EPAC1 deletion mutations suggest that the RA domain of EPAC1 was critical for mediating the interaction with Ran-GTP and RanBP2 proteins. this RA-dependent EPAC1-Ran interaction was also determined to be required for efficient EPAC1-induced Rap1 activation. this suggests that nuclear localization of EPAC1 may facilitate Rap1 activation in response to elevated levels of cAMP (620) a naturally occurring EPAC2 variant, EPAC2B, that lacks the CNB-A domain is targeted to the nuclear fraction in a similar fashion as EPAC1 (36, 811) a more recent study further supports that interaction between EPAC1 and importin 1 may contribute to dynamic partitioning of EPAC1 between the PM and NM (38). interaction between EPAC1 and MT suppresses EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activity (686), association of LC1 or LC2 enhances EPAC1-mediated Rap1 activation (94, 381) these results reveal a linkage between cAMP-mediated EPAC signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics. further studies are required to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological functions of this EPAC1-mediated regulation for centrosome positioning. the involvement of previously identified partners associated with the EPAC1 signalosome at the nuclear envelope will be of great interest. the MT and actin cytoskeleton network is critical for mitochondrial dynamics and positioning. activation of EPAC1 by 007-AM stimulates Ca2+ exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrion by promoting the formation of a macromolecular complex composed of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75) and the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) between the ER and the mitochondrion interface the RA domain is required for cAMP-induced PM translocation of EPAC2A. this domain is essential for the clustering of EPAC2A to granule docking sites in -cells. deletion of the DEP domain in EPAC2A leads to increased basal membrane and granule localization regardless of cAMP levels. colo, as well as Rim1, is confirmed by affinity pull-down approaches. functional analyses suggest EPAC2, Piccolo, Rim2, and Rab3 form a signaling complex to mediate cAMP-induced, PKA-independent exocytosis. overexpression of a Rim2 deletion mutant containing the EPAC2-binding domain disrupts endogenous interactions between EPAC2 and Rim2 and inhibits cAMP/EPAC2-mediated exocytosis. interaction between EPAC2 and SUR1 is inhibited by cAMP but not affected by ATP. interaction between EPAC2 and Rim2 or Piccolo is cAMP-independent (955, 956) and in dentate granule cells (1199) cAMP alone did not induce fusion of the granules to the PM. cAMP promoted the fusion events only by increasing the number of restless newcomers. cAMP-potentiated fusion events during exocytosis were markedly abridged in EPAC2/ mice (957) some where EPAC2 binds Rim1 increase association with Rab3 to maneuver synaptic vesicles in closer proximity to the plasma membrane. EPAC2-mediated generation of DAG through the PLC pathway may be involved in activation and translocation of Munc13\u20131 promoting binding to Rim1 and subsequent SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle release. adenosine GPCR (Ado-GPCR) A2A, AKAP79/150, PDE3A, and AC6 appear to form a separate functional macromolecular complex that generates an unconnected cAMP pool. the proposed signalosomes are mainly based on functional analyses, as well as affinity pull-down and colocalization studies. functional analyses suggest EPAC2, Piccolo, Rim2 and Rab3 form a signaling complex to mediate cAMP-induced, PKA-independent exocytosis. overexpression of a Rim2 deletion mutant containing the EPAC2-binding domain disrupts endogenous interactions between EPAC2 and Rim2 and inhibits cAMP/EPAC2-mediated exocytosis. this supports the notion that the effects of EPAC2 on exocytosis are interaction between EPAC2 and SUR1 is inhibited by cAMP but not affected by ATP. interaction between EPAC2 and Rim2 or Piccolo is cAMP-independent (955, 956) cAMP-potentiated fusion events in the first phase of glucose-induced exocytosis were markedly abridged in EPAC2/ mice (957). cAMP-potentiated fusion events in the first phase of glucose-induced exocytosis were markedly abridged in EPAC2/ mice (957). EPAC2-mediated generation of DAG may be involved in activation and translocation of Munc13\u20131 promoting binding to Rim1 and subsequent SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle release (301). EPAC2\u2019s binding of SUR1 is also observed to affect exocytosis in dentate granule presynaptic terminals. observed attenuation of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) generation in animals where EPAC adenosine GPCR (Ado-GPCR) A2A, AKAP79/150, PDE3A, and AC6 appear to form a separate functional macromolecular complex that generates an unconnected cAMP pool to selectively activate PKA (379). some of the physiological functions of EPAC proteins have been found to be involved or responsible for regulating a myriad of physiological functions throughout multiple biological systems. pain hyperalgesia (268), chronic postoperative pain (142) Renal IRI renal failure (813, 986) ARPKD hepatic cystogenesis (54), tubular epithelial adhesion (813) Pulmonary inflammation Vascular barrier recovery (81) EPAC1 null Cardiovascular Basal contractility (785), stress-induced myopathies and arrhythmias (785) a central nervous system transfer of information in the CNS is carried out by the temporal release of neurotransmitters into the synapse between two proximal neurons. this transmission can be triggered by nerve stimulation, depolarization, or developmental cues, but must be tightly regulated. increased levels of cAMP induce enhanced neurotransmission from presynaptic terminals. increased levels of cAMP induce enhanced neurotransmission from presynaptic terminals. cAMP-mediated enhancement was attributed to the action of PKA. universal second messenger cAMP was found less effective than a selective EPAC activator (897) cAMP was postulated to enhance neurotransmitter release through potentiating the probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release or increasing the number of vesicles available for release. cAMP was found less effective than a selective EPAC activator (897) correlation between EPAC and Munc-13\u20131 in vesicle release was determined using a FM1\u201343 membrane probe to detect a range of vesicle release mechanisms at the nerve terminal (852). this would suggest EPAC and Munc13\u20131 pathways are distinct from one another, but both serve to enhance neurotransmission. however, a more recent account supports the role of EPAC in enhancing glutamate release in direct correlation to Munc13\u20131 translocation and binding with RIM1 more studies in the hippocampal regions of RIM1 knockout mice show that forskolin-induced EPSC are unaffected by the loss of RIM, creating a point of controversy in the field (152) the role of EPAC in neuropeptide release in other neurons was also investigated with mixed conclusions. brefeldin A inhibits a high-molecular-weight Golgi-associated ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GBF1 (772) brefeldin A is not an EPAC inhibitor as intended (860) new chemical inhibitors that are selective for EPAC have become more readily available and could assist in clarifying functional roles for EPAC in neurons. to release after extended synaptic activity were found to be diminished in the absence of EPAC2. this suggests that EPAC2 is essential in the regulation of the reserve pool of vesicles as well as vesicle release in response to increased cAMP levels (294) the presynaptic transmission was found to be unaltered. inhibition of Ras signaling, but not Rap1, can block these effects in sensory neurons. effects of EPACs on ion channels to depolarize or hyperpolarize the neuron may also have functional consequence. the function of EPAC extends further to inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels leading to greater neuronal excitability (FIGURE 8) (707). the majority of data lend towards EPACs functioning to propagate neurotransmission by increasing neuropeptide release, neuronal potentiation, and enhancing firing rate of action potentials. EPAC in the embryonic growth cone, attraction properties are linked to the direct action of netrin-1 on EPAC. diminishing levels of cAMP promote netrin-1 to target PKA inducing repulsion in postnatal growth cones (747) axonal growth is important to the development of mature neurons, but growth arrest is also required to confer complete differentiation. a coordinated action between the cAMP-independent NGF activation of ERK and EPAC2 induction of p38 MAPK provokes growth arrest and neuritogenic effects. the development and maintenance of dendrites are important to the processes of synaptic remodeling and plasticity of the brain. in synaptic remodeling, EPAC2 activation of Rap promotes synapse destabilization of the dendritic spines. kinase (PI3K) in the presence of active PKA was effective in reversing the effect (1139) a recent study by wei et al. showed that PKA inhibition alone enhances neurite outgrowth in DRG neurons, but co-inhibition of PKA and EPAC effectively reduces neurite outgrowth. the authors found that PKA inhibition could effectively enhance recovery and sprouting of injured axons. EPAC activates Src kinase to promote tyrosine residue 499. in neurons Rit was found to be required to sustain p38 activation. ERK1/2 activity was unaltered (954) EPAC-mediated activation of MAPK and subsequent nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in Schwann cells. elevated cAMP was involved in enhanced differentiation and myelin formation, in part, through an EPAC-dependent mechanism (39). cAMP was involved in enhanced differentiation and myelin formation, in part, through an EPAC-dependent mechanism (39). generation of memories is thought to rely on the plasticity of the neurons in the hippocampus. EPAC signaling is implicated in both LTP and LTD in hippocampal cells supporting a potential role for EPACs in the cognitive process. a 129Sv murine strain showed enhanced miRNA-124 and decreased Zif-268 translation in these animals. genetic suppression of miR-124 or pharmacological treatment of scopolamine-treated rats with melatonin reversed apparent neurological disorders. overinduction of miRNA-124 was found to mimic the EPAC-null mice defects. there is slight controversy within the animal models however. EPAC1 knockout mice have reduced food intake resulting in decreased body weight (1150) the combination of genetic and pharmacological manipulations of EPAC1 demonstrate the importance of this cAMP-signal modulator in energy homeostasis and leptin signaling. these animals have heightened leptin sensitivity measured by an increase of signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in the hypothalamus (1150) specific targeting of these cAMP effectors may serve as an effective platform to combat neuronal pathologies. compared with other organ systems, functional roles for EPAC in the cardiovascular system are well-studied. for example, in human cardiac tissue from heart failure patients, EPAC1 expression is markedly upregulated, defining a role for the cAMP effector in cardiac function. ull mice exhibit resistance to several induced cardiac stresses. ull mice exhibit resistance to several induced cardiac stresses. inhibition of an EPAC isoform is beneficial to protect from cardiac stresses. inhibition of RhoA is accomplished by downstream actions of cAMP sensors, PKA and EPAC/Rap1, decreasing contractile force generated by RhoA. major mechanisms used by cAMP signaling to attenuate contraction include direct inhibition of RhoA through Ser188 phosphorylation (272, 749), reduction of intracellular calcium influx from the SR (208) and exclusion of MYPT1 Ser696 inhibitory phosphorylation. a transient increase in Ca2+ generated by direct EPAC activation with 007 is observed to attenuate pinacidil-mediated activation of KATP by 42% in a Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase 2B (calcineurin)-dependent mechanism. the suppressive action of EPAC on KATP is only observed in the absence of PKA activation. Rap1B-null mice exhibit reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation of eNOS and subsequent NO generation promoting the development of hypertension. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists also have a favorable effect in reducing hypertension (963) agonist stimulation promotes EPAC2 translocation to the membrane fraction. in the absence of GLP-1Rs direct activation of EPAC stimulates ANP secretion. this suggests that EPAC2 functions downstream of GLP-1R to enhance ANP secretion. translocation of 2c-adrenoreceptors to the cell surface was accomplished by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and increased F-actin. the activation of EPAC and cAMP elevation was accomplished by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and increased F-actin. the retention of barrier integrity is of utmost importance to the vasculature to maintain proper pressure control, transport of macromolecules and solutes. the functional role of EPAC in regulating the tightness of the endothelial barrier is receiving greater attention as tools to probe EPAC and PKA functions have become available. two very recent accounts describe the function of EPAC isoforms in microvascular permeability. loss of EPAC1 increased baseline permeability observed as increased transvascular transport of radiolabeled albumin. wild-type and EPAC2-null animals remained sensitive to ANP stimulation. the suppressive signal to reduce proliferation is attributed to cAMP inhibition of cell-cycle regulators, cyclin D and Skp2. however, further investigation revealed that PKA inhibition incompletely restores Skp2 expression after cAMP stimulation. however, further investigation revealed that PKA inhibition incompletely restores Skp2 expression after cAMP stimulation. cAMP-mediated cell-cycle arrest in VSMCs appears to be a combination of effects facilitated by EPAC and PKA to alter transcriptional regulation of mitogenic genes. however, the mechanism of overlapping regulatory roles for EPAC and PKA in these pathways requires more experimentation to be fully defined. the functional consequence of Rap1 deletion leads to the thought that EPAC may also participate in angiogenesis through Rap1 signaling. initial studies focusing on the angiogenesis of tumors found that in human microvascular endothelial cells activation of EPAC or Rap1 attenuates VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. cAMP enlists functional pathways of both EPAC and PKA to induce vasorelaxation and oppose RhoA-mediated contraction. this process involves modulation of both vascular smooth muscle cytoskeletal mechanics as well as endothelial secretion of vasodilatory molecules to enhance the relaxant effect. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis covers the functions of three endocrine glands, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal gland. the hypothalamus incorporates information from various sensory pathways and controls many physiological functions including appetite, energy balance, and circadian rhythms. cAMP-elevating agents can impair leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic brain slices. cAMP-elevating agents can impair leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic brain slices. this inhibity effect is not affected by PKA inhibition. mice exhibit reduced food intake, white adipose tissue (WAT) and plasma leptin levels. pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 by the EPAC-selective inhibitor ESI-09 reduces plasma leptin levels in vivo and enhances leptin signaling in organotypic hypothalamic slices (1150) whole-body deletion of EPAC2A induces hypothalamic leptin signaling. early-onset increases in plasma leptin levels and decreases in plasma adiponectin levels. this suggests a protective role of EPAC2 against obesity. EPAC inhibition mitigates -MSH-induced expression of c-fos and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (pKA) mRNA. inhibition of PKA blocks TRH expression alone. cAMP signaling is previously reported to perform vital roles in various pituitary functions. cAMP promotes fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane by interaction with EPAC2/Rim2 (928) hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate pituitary cell functions by generating different intracellular second messengers. cAMP increases DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression in primary cells isolated from human somatotropinomas. ectopically expressed EPAC2B retains the ability to activate downstream effector Rap1 in a cAMP-dependent manner. unlike EPAC2A, ectopically expressed EPAC2B is primarily localized in cytosol and incapable of stimulating hormone secretion in response to increased intracellular cAMP in MIN6 cells (766) in the adrenal cortex, cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in response to trophic hormones and other external stimuli is largely adrenal zona glomerulosa cells produce mineralocorticoids in response to extracellular stimuli such as ACTH, angiotensin II (ANG II) and extracellular potassium. activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) is essential for aldosterone production stimulated by ANG II, ACTH, and cAMP. cAMP-mediated inhibition of the adrenal TREK-1 channels is unaffected by inhibition of PKA. intracellular administration of a selective EPAC agonist, 007, mimics the effects of cAMP by inhibiting TREK-1 channel activation in an EPAC2-dependent manner (625) cAMP analogs modified at position 6 of the adenine ring reveal that intracellular administration of 6-benzoyl-cAMP or 6-monobutyryl-cAMP potently ERK in PC12 cells reveals that stimulation of PKA is sufficient to evoke rapid and transient ERK activation. concomitant activation of EPAC suppresses PKA- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced proliferation and promotes neurite outgrowth. results suggest activation of EPAC synergizes with PKA induction. gene expression profile analyses of human primary cultured thyrocytes further support the conclusions with TSH, FSK, PKA activator N6-MB-cAMP treated cultures sharing similar mRNA expression profiles. studies using PCCL3 suggest that EPAC, in cooperation with PKA, is required for TSH-mediated cell proliferation. anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and benign follicular adenoma reveal significant EPAC1 expression variations among thyroid tumor types. this pattern of strong expression in more differentiated thyroid tumor and weaker expression in less differentiated subtypes is consistent with the finding that activation of EPAC proteins stimulate the proliferation of a differentiated rat thyroid cell line. cAMP-induced progesterone secretion is mediated by both PKA and EPAC1. granulosa cells become less susceptible to PKA inhibition as luteinization progresses. cAMP-induced progesterone secretion is mediated by both PKA and EPAC1. cAMP plays critical roles in regulating sperm motility, capacitation, and acrosome reaction. EPACs, both EPAC1 and EPAC2 along with their downstream effector Rap1, are expressed in mouse male germ cells (8, 21, 74), as well as in stallion and boar spermatozoa (705). the activation of EPAC, not PKA, is demonstrated to be responsible for cAMP-induced flagellar bending that generates the propulsive force for sperm motility (531) results suggest that EPAC proteins play an important role in mammalian gamete recognition and fertilization. further demonstration of the potential for EPAC proteins to exhibit these physiological functions is illustrated by expression of both EPAC1 and EPAC2. immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrate expression of EPAC1 and EPAC2 in human placental tissue within the mononuclear villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) and the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB), which produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone (1174). cAMP-induced functional differentiation and syncytialization of human trophoblasts is mediated by the EPAC signal EPAC1 stimulates histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) phosphorylation on ser259 and ser498 in a Rap1- and CaMKI-dependent manner. cAMP-mediated decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells during pregnancy (568\u2013571) and hCG-mediated leptin gene expression in human placental cells (669, 670) glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) comprises a biphasic release of insulin with a rapid burst of insulin during the initial phase, followed by a second attenuated, but more sustained insulin release. the second phase requires mobilization and subsequent priming of insulin vesicles to replenish the depleted RRP (987) interactions between EPAC2, SUR1, Rim2 and Piccolo are inhibited by high cAMP concentrations (955) these interactions bring together sensors for cAMP, ATP, and calcium to coordinate insulin exocytosis in -cells. subsequent studies suggest that EPAC proteins act independently of PKA to mediate cAMP\u2019s inhibitory effect on the KATP in pancreatic -cells. inhibition of PKA activity virtually abolished the action of EPAC-selective cAMP analogs to potentiate GSIS in human islets. the effect of GLP-1 on GK is cAMP/EPAC-dependent, but PKA-independent. an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipITT) shows slightly increased insulin sensitivity in EPAC2A/ mice as compared with wild-type mice. the lack of EPAC2A had little impact on GSIS in lean mice, but deletion of EPAC2A resulted in reduced GSIS and impaired glucose tolerance. a potential explanation for this discrepancy is that EPAC2A/ mice exhibit improved insulin sensitivity. deletion of EPAC2A outside of the -cell may offset the effect of increased incretin levels on GSIS after an oGTT. sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced in epac2A knockout mice. sulfonylureas were capable of activating an EPAC2-based FRET sensor in cells. only a sensor based on EPAC2 but not EPAC1 can be activated by sulfonylureas. sulfonylureas are not able to bind and activate EPAC2, casting doubts on the direct interaction between EPAC2 and sulfonylureas (859, 1041). gliclazide, unlike tolbutamide and other sulfonylureas, was shown to be ineffective in activating EPAC2-FRET sensors (412, 1189), gliclazide did potently inhibit KATP activity. glucagon release in mouse and rat -cells can also be regulated in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. glucagon stimulates exocytosis in -cells by binding to glucagon receptor. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to stimulate the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulator Oct-1. glucagon and GLP-1, along with glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP), GLP-2, glicentin, and oxyntomodulin (OXM) are all produced from a common precursor, proglucagon via alternative processing by prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) in pancreatic -cells or PC1 in intestinal L cells. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to regulate Gcg expression by stimulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Cdx-2 expression. ectopic expression of either a dominant negative or constitutively active form of EPAC2 suppresses Gcg expression. previously observed inhibitory effects of dominant negative EPAC2 on Gcg expression were likely caused by nonspecific suppression by overexpressing EPAC2. evidence also suggests that EPAC regulates the secretion of ghrelin. glucagon stimulates ghrelin mRNA production and secretion by activating glucagon receptors. glucagon-induced ghrelin is independent of PKA activation, but requires EPAC signaling. salivary glands Saliva production is regulated by synergistic signaling cross-talk mediated by intracellular second messengers IP3 and cAMP. activation of -adrenergic receptor enhances P2X4R- or P2X7R-mediated intracellular calcium influx. however, enhancement of Ca2+ changes by cAMP modulators is largely mediated by PKA. this shorter, liver-specific form of EPAC2 lacks the first CNB domain and DEP domain. however, the cAMP-induced GEF activity toward Rap1 is retained. this EPAC2 form may play a distinctive role in hepatic functions (1049) glucagon and cAMP suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and activity in hepatocytes through a PKA-independent mechanism that involves JNK (1187). a cAMP analog specific for EPAC, but not for PKA, inhibits cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in hepatocytes. glucagon acting through cAMP negatively regulates IL-6-induced MAP kinase activation. however, this inhibitory effect appears to involve both EPAC and PKA. glucagon/cAMP increases hepatic FGF21 production at posttranscriptional levels. bile acids are known to produce both beneficial and harmful effects by activating distinct intracellular signaling pathways. in the liver, bile acids are known to produce both beneficial and harmful effects by activating distinct intracellular signaling pathways. cAMP-mediated protection against bile acid-induced apoptosis is PKA independent. phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration may contribute to cytoprotective effects against statin-induced toxicity in hepatocytes. polarization of hepatocytes is important for separating apical and basolateral membrane domains and forming the bile canaliculus. cholestasis is a pathological condition involving the impairment of bile secretion. glucagon and a 2 adrenergic agonist, salbutamol, increase intracellular cAMP. salbutamol promotes a microtubule-dependent and long-range trafficking of abcb11/Abcc2-containing vesicles. the endocrine function of bile acids is mainly mediated through activation of plasma membrane and nuclear receptors. the endocrine function of bile acids is mainly mediated through activation of plasma membrane and nuclear receptors, including the GPCR TGR5 (509) and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) or NR1H4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4). the intestinal proton-coupled peptide transporter mediates the uptake of dipeptides and tripeptides across the brush-border membranes into enterocytes. earlier studies have established that glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) but not GLP-1, enhances PepT1-mediated peptide absorption in murine jejunum by a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway (201) pancreatic functions EPAC proteins, particularly EPAC2, are implicated in major regulatory functions related to the endocrine arm of the pancreas. cytosolic Ca2+ in response to muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulation is the principal stimulus for zymogen secretion in pancreatic acinar cells. cAMP acts through EPAC and PKA independently to activate the RyRs which accelerate calcium waves in pancreatic acinar cells. cAMP acts through EPAC and PKA to activate the RyRs which accelerate calcium waves in pancreatic acinar cells. imal convoluted tubule (PCT), proximal straight tubule (PST), thin descending limbs of Henle's loop (ATL), cortical thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (CTAL), cortical collecting duct (CCD), outer medullary duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) with the highest expression observed in the CCD (584). expression of EPAC1 protein double labeling of EPAC1 with Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) revealed that EPAC1 was expressed in all TAL cells. expression of EPAC1 in the convoluted tubule/connecting tubule was weaker than that of the PT. in the collecting duct, EPAC1 was evenly distributed in intercalated cells. calcitonin-induced stimulation of H+-K+-ATPase in -intercalated (I) cells of rat is mediated by EPAC1 (584) calcitonin-induced stimulation of H+-K+-ATPase in -intercalated (I) cells of rat is mediated by EPAC1 (584) calcitonin-induced stimulation of H+-K+-ATPase in -intercalated (I) cells calcitonin-induced H+-K+-ATPase stimulation was accompanied by a PKA-independent ERK activation. this could be suppressed by an ERK specific inhibitor U0126, as well as antibodies against Rap1 or Raf-1. -intercalated and -intercalated cells utilize discrete cAMP signaling pathways. inhibition of NHE3 by EPAC activation does not affect phosphorylation levels and is insensitive to H89. inhibition of MEK1/2 by PD98059 completely blocked the inhibitory effect on NHE3 imposed upon by EPAC activation, while only partially attenuating the PKA-mediated effect. ANG II-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines could be blocked by a NHE3 inhibitor S3226 or with EPAC1 and PKA activators. a family of NHE3-binding proteins, acting as cofactors, is required for cAMP-mediated NHE3 inhibition (251) studies using primary BBM isolated from the kidney cortex of NHERF1/ mice have shown that NHERF1 is required for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (1109). deletion of NHERF1 failed to block cAMP\u2019s inhibitory effect on NHE3 in the ileum. both PKA and EPAC were equally involved in cAMP-mediated NHE3 inhibition. but the inhibitory effects of cAMP on ileal NHE3 were exclusively mediated by PKA. urea flux stimulated by vasopressin and forskolin was only partially blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKA. urea flux stimulated by vasopressin and forskolin was only partially blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting a PKA-independent cAMP component downstream of arginine vasopressin (AVP) (314). AQP2, an AVP-sensitive water channel expressed in the principal cells of the CD, is the best known and most studied. dehydration-induced secretion of AVP results in activation of the basolateral V2-vasopressin receptors in the basolateral plasma membrane of the CD. this receptor initiates the transcription, translocation, and fusion of AQP2-containing intracellular vesicles. KA mediates intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and apical exocytotic membrane fusion of AQP2 in IMCD (1167) potential candidates of Ca2+ signaling molecules that may be modulated by EPAC include calmodulin, myosin light-chain kinase, calmodulin kinase II, and calcineurin (44). dDAVP-induced AQP2 transcription upregulated expression of EPAC1. inhibition of PKA after 3 days of dDAVP stimulation did not suppress AQP2 transcription. however, incubation with a specific EPAC agonist 3 days after dDAVP pretreatment increased both AQP2 transcription and abundance compared with sole dDAVP treatment. studies show that PTH- or dopamine-mediated regulation of the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (Npt2a) is dependent on PKC or PKC and PKA, respectively, but EPAC and MAPK activation in mouse PT cells are uninvolved. however, the kidney regulates K+ homeostasis by modulating the activity of K+ secretory channels, including the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) both EPAC and PKA are involved in cAMP-mediated signaling in Drosophila renal tubules. each cAMP effector provides distinct functions in modulating fluid secretion in a cell-type-specific manner. cAMP signaling has been implicated in signaling pathways responsible for the mitogenic and contractile state of the tissue. improper stimuli affecting phenotype switching in airway smooth muscle can lead to irreversible airway remodeling in patients where excessive proliferation increases the thickness of the smooth muscle through both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. commonly 2-AR agonists are used to induce smooth muscle relaxation in the airways of asthmatic patients. induction of cAMP by Gs-coupled agonist mimics effects of 2-AR agonists (417, 456, 500, 881, 927, 1032) forskolin stimulation demonstrates greatest inhibition of EGF-dependent mitogenic signaling. reagents exhibited greater inhibitory effects than 2-AR agonists. these reagents were 10-fold less potent as compared with selective EPAC activation. these results depict an essential role for EPAC in the inhibition of EGF-stimulated proliferation by 2-AR agonists (500) PDGF-induced proliferative, hypo-contractile phenotype blocked by activation of either PKA or EPAC mimicking the PGE2 treatment. both sustained ERK and p70S6K activation are required for proliferation in airway smooth muscle. only PKA activation could block p70S6K phosphorylation (881) the inability of 2-AR agonists to sustain cAMP signaling may underlie the ineffective prevention of smooth muscle remodeling. the sustained cAMP increase may be important for adequate activation of both EPAC and PKA to more completely inhibit growth factor-stimulated mitogenic effects in airway smooth muscle. the balance of RhoA versus Rac1 activity directly affects the activation of these enzymes where RhoA leads to constriction by MLC phosphatase inhibition. Rac1 activity contrastingly decreases MLC phosphorylation by triggering p21-activated kinase to phosphorylate. the regulation of this RhoA/Rac1 balance by cAMP was apparent in bronchial smooth muscle cells where the 2-AR agonist salbutamol effectively blocked calpeptin-induced RhoA activation. further support for EPAC signaling through Rac1 was observed using Clostridium difficile toxin B-1470 that selectively inhibits Rac1 through monoglucosylation (917) RNA was unable to prevent isoproterenol-induced decrease in cell stiffness. loss of PKA function resulted in unregulated histamine-induced phosphorylation of MLC-20 by -AR agonist. these results suggest that PKA is involved in the relaxation effect of -AR agonists. D1 receptor agonists may also exhibit minor activation of dopamine D2 receptors (716) this could represent different pharmacokinetics of the synthetic agonist, but endogenous dopamine may alternatively function on parallel pathways not affected by D1 receptor agonist stimulation. further investigation is still needed to fully elucidate the actions of dopamine versus the D1 receptor agonist. effects of sex hormones are noted in the progression of asthma. prepubescent child asthma is more common in boys. postpuberty asthma becomes more prevalent in women until postmenopause (828) cAMP signaling pathways act on modulatory proteins involved in release and sequestration of Ca2+ during contraction/relaxation of the myocyte. cAMP signaling pathways act on modulatory proteins involved in the release and sequestration of Ca2+ during the contraction/relaxation of the myocyte. cAMP signaling pathways act on modulatory proteins involved in the release and sequestration of the myocyte. acute stimulation of -AR induces cAMP and activates downstream effectors PKA and EPAC to initiate CICR. loss of PLC- expression or inhibition attenuated the electrically induced Ca2+ transient amplitude in response to 007 stimulation. reintroduction of PLC- rescued the increased Ca2+ induction. induction of the -AR/EPAC/PLC-/PKC- did not alter L-type Ca2+ in the presence or absence of PLC- (778, 779, 819, 820) 007 activation of EPAC signaling reduced SR Ca2+ load correlating with decreased Ca2+ transients (154, 208, 820) explanations for discrepancies described above could be attributed to differences in experimental procedures leading to altered SR Ca2+ leak or spark generation. each study agrees that EPAC activation leads to sensitization of RyR receptors through CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation. this suggests contrasting roles for PKA and EPAC in alteration of Ca2+ sensitivity. the convergent actions of EPAC1 and PKA at PLN Ser16 were determined to be additive in nature. the phosphorylation of PLN at Thr17, a CaMKII site, was initially observed to be regulated by EPAC activation in vitro. however, EPAC1-null heart homogenates did not portray altered phosphorylation of PLN Thr17. this may represent potential differences in the knockout efficiency of siRNA versus genomic chronic activation of EPAC in vitro or in vivo only promotes increased Ca2+ transients demonstrated with rapid caffeine application. decay of the Ca2+ transient was stunted suggestive that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is suppressed during EPAC activation. a negative regulator for RyRs may be indicative of a negative-feedback mechanism that is activated to diminish arrhythmias (890) during acute activation of the cAMP sensor, arrhythmias such as spontaneous ventricular tachycardia develop (439). these spontaneous events of Ca2+ release implicated in arrhythmia induction can be linked with the previously observed increase in Ca2+ spark generation of isolated cardiomyocytes (820, 821) EPAC activation is implicated in reduction of cytosolic Ca2+ levels in cardiomyocytes. it is also associated with activation of eNOS, along with PKA, in endothelial cells to produce NO. during stress, EPAC/Rap1 initiates a RhoA-dependent mechanism to translocate 2c-adrenoreceptors to the cell surface. -adrenergic stimulation of cAMP in a skeletal muscle cell line does not appear to induce PKA, PI3K, PKC, PKG, or EPAC-dependent signaling systems to inhibit contractility and detachment. cAMP activates K+ channels for extracellular Ca2+ depletion-induced ROCK-dependent contractility. smooth muscle revealed only a minor role for EPAC activation in relaxation. increased relaxation was shown following cAMP inhibition of M3 receptor Ca2+ sensitization. the relaxant action of cAMP, mainly PKA, in this system is observed to be limited to regulation of ROCK. EPAC is not directly involved in the maintenance of G0 quiescence in these satellite cells. it indirectly modulates stem cell activity by preventing premature escape from the niche. a follow-up study further illustrated the synergistic effect of PKA and EPAC activation by highlighting the decrease in Egr1 expression. the role of EPAC1/Rap1 activation was previously determined to be inhibitory to collagen synthesis in rat cardiac fibroblasts (1071, 1171), thus EPAC may be responsible for the regulation of fibrotic scarring of the heart. a reduction in activity of cAMP sensors, like EPAC, is observed at reduced cAMP levels in response to elevated PDE1A (700) stimulation, direct EPAC activation in epicardial cells suppressed markers of smooth muscle, smooth muscle protein 22 (SM22), smooth muscle actin (SMA) and maintained cell-cell contacts suggesting prevention of EMT. suppressive action of cAMP on EMT and EPAC/Rap1 roles could again be targeted to decrease fibrosis and promote healing of affected hearts. epinephrine activity increased cAMP-induced EPAC activation and Akt phosphorylation was enhanced in the presence of insulin stimuli. support for this conclusion was further developed with the use of the EPAC agonist 007 to induce phosphorylation of Akt. insulin stimulates production of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) by activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor. this leads to the recruitment of PI3K by IRS and subsequent phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) activation of both Akt phosphorylation sites. Akt then phosphorylates Foxo1/3a transcription factors to occlude their nuclear translocation, thus disrupting transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases pentoxifylline, a nonselective PDE inhibitor, was found to activate both phosphorylation sites of Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) and subsequently phosphorylate Foxo3a (Thr32) to prevent nuclear transport (66). this suggests a potential shift of cAMP balance readily available for EPAC activation and potentiation of downstream signaling in skeletal muscle. phosphorylation of 2-AR, CREB, Akt, 4E-BP1 and Foxo3a were at the highest deviations from normal after a few days. this would suggest that with continual 2-AR activation other pro-anabolic pathways would need to be induced to sustain the positive effect. this altered signaling may be caused by receptor desensitization or decreased receptor density observed on the 10th day in the study. K or EPAC reversed the effect of the PDE4 inhibitor, suggesting that EPAC is required for the anabolic effect in these animals after serious injury. efforts to unveil the nature of these signaling pathways in other muscle groups, such as skeletal muscle mentioned above, continue to expand. -related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is known to be a triggering factor for the osteogenesis lineage determination. a reduction in RhoA and resultant focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity can activate the downstream MEK/ERK pathway to increase phosphorylation Runx2 and thereby direct stimulation of osteogenic genes. signaling pathways involving these hormones are highly regarded as the most important in the process of bone growth and resorption. the bidirectional signal is attributed to a heterogeneous microenvironment within a diverse population of osteoblasts (133, 498, 581, 582) IL-6 expression through CREB activity with inhibition of ERK and PKC mirroring this reduction to lesser extent. a conclusion further supported in mouse calvarial osteoblasts where VIP stimulation leads to IL-6 expression through increased phosphorylation of CREB by PKA. the activity of PKA was also reported to play a partial role in inhibiting expression of osterix, an important osteoblast specific transcription factor, in an EPAC-independent manner. negative-feedback mechanism by PKA could be attributed to PKA countering MAPK activation through phosphorylation of Raf-1 and subsequent inactivation of Ras/Raf-1/MEK signaling. even partial involvement of MAPK could suggest a potential, unexplored role for EPAC in this mitogenic process through modulation of Rap1/B-Raf/MEK pathways. a group also commented on this effect where ERK activity is gradually decreased in maturing osteoblasts. these results depict a signaling pathway through EPAC/Rap1/B-Raf to induce bone growth. also illustrate the input of multiple regulatory brakes, such as PKA activity and B-Raf expression, to stabilize MAPK signaling. osteoblast cells showed a potential negative regulation of PKA on ERK activity. cAMP elevation restored effects induced by celecoxib, a similar agent to iloprost. cAMP-induced adhesion of osteoblasts is clearly important in development of bone regeneration technology. osteoclastogenesis involves a highly regulated cascade of signaling systems to coordinate the processes of differentiation, fusion, and function. acceleration of osteoporosis is common following loss of ovarian function and has been attributed to decreased estrogen and elevation of FSH. elevation of cAMP by PDE inhibition is observed to augment bone mass. forskolin imitated the effect of cilostazol and more importantly loss of PKA and EPAC1 effectively blocked impairment of osteoclasts both alone and in tandem. cilostazol\u2019s elevation of cAMP affected the transcriptional regulation of the osteoclast precursors. cAMP inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is observed in a highly enriched (CD45R-CD3-CD115+) population of osteoclast progenitor cells. calcitonin was found to be effective at inhibiting osteoclast development only 24 h before completion of 96-h cultures. the role of cAMP in osteoclastogenesis remains controversial. however, initial results suggest exploitation of such a process could prove beneficial in stimulating bone growth for patients with bone regression diseases such as osteoporosis. innate immunity is primarily accomplished by specialized cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, natural killers, and dendritic cells. signaling through cAMP is known to be important for many functions of these innate immune cells. selective EPAC agonist induced activation of Rap1 in differentiated neutrophil-like cell lines and human polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes began to alter this concept (223) this observation was ultimately supported by visual mRNA and protein levels of EPAC1 in human PMN cells (223) leukemic cell lines differentiated into PMN cells, suggesting a specific activation of 2 integrins by this signaling pathway. but in human PMN, induction of EPAC was without effect on adhesion. this could suggest that although Rap1 is active in human neutrophils, translocation of Rap1 requires further signals that are either basally, or exogenously, activated. the 2-agonist salbutamol and several glucocorticoids are observed to attenuate neutrophil phagocytosis (925) stimulation with 2-agonist impaired RhoA activity and phagocytic levels in neutrophils. however, an exciting result demonstrated protective actions of EPAC activation opposing the function of PKA. depicted are currently reported signaling cascades involving EPAC1 in complement-mediated and IgG-mediated phagocytosis. also, 2 integrins are also associated with complement-induced phagocytosis of neutrophils and macrophages. RIAM is integral to the complement-mediated phagocytosis process in HL60 cells. the complex formation and recruitment is lost with RIAM silencing, suggesting that RIAM is crucial for \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling of Rap1. RIAM is involved in recruitment of talin for subsequent activation of 2 integrins to induce \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling and initiate the engulfment process. in delaying apoptosis, the cAMP analog and PKA activator decreased the level of microparticles in an EPAC-independent manner (697) these studies depict the complex nature of cAMP signaling in neutrophils and demonstrate selective activation of cAMP sensors for varying effects. conclusions to date demonstrate discriminatory targeting of PKA and EPAC may modulate neutrophil responses in ways that are clinically advantageous. transcriptional regulation requires transcriptional modification often induced by an ever-changing cytokine milieu. TGF-1 can suppress or accelerate cell growth in cancerous cells. this could suggest an analogous signaling pathway involved in transcriptional regulation of these cells. activators CBP/p300 and others suggest that PKA modification of the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of p65 inhibits NFB activity. initial approaches defined that LPS induced cAMP and Rap1 activity to a similar extent as direct stimulation of EPAC. the activity induced by LPS and EPAC activation was abolished in the presence of a dominant-negative Rap1-N17 construct. p1 activation appears to involve the combined action of PKA to phosphorylate p65 Ser276 and ROS/EPAC/Rap1 to phosphorylate p65 Ser276 and Ser536 (723), supporting the initial report that mBAFF expression is reliant on PKA and EPAC activation. however, the verdict is still out on how this regulation of EPAC/Rap1 phosphorylates NFB. ERK1/2- and p38-mediated phosphorylation of activating transcription factor (ATF) 1 and 2 (1008) activity of other transcriptional regulators on IL-1 and IL-6 expression including C/EBP and CREB were largely unaffected by 2-AR stimulation. potential cross-talk between EPAC and MAPK pathways in this signaling system. transcriptional regulation of genes is differentially regulated in response to cAMP levels and environmental stimuli leading to cooperative or antagonistic EPAC and PKA pathways. cAMP-mediated elevation of TNF- is suppressed by PKA agonist or induction of cAMP in alveolar (31, 32), peritoneal (32), monocyte-derived (120), and cell line (37, 976) macrophages. the authors describe the suppression of CCL3 to implicate EPAC. the use of a more specific inhibitor to validate this conclusion is warranted (895) the authors describe the suppression of CCL3 to implicate EPAC. monocytes respond by rolling along the vascular endothelia through integrin CD11b/ICAM interactions and proceeding through the process of diapedesis to enter the stressed tissue. CD11b\u2019s role shifts to locate C3b complement-opsonized particles and induce phagocytosis. treatment is suggested to be modulated by EPAC/Rap1 activation of ARAP3 and subsequent inactivation of RhoA (728) monocytes treated initially with LPS lose their chemotactic capacity, while those treated with chemokine then with LPS retain initial chemotactic potential. this suggests that the order of stimuli matters to determine the response. cAMP by forskolin increases activation of Akt to promote proliferation of macrophages. inhibition of PKA or knockdown of CREB by 60\u201370% effectively attenuates the mitogenic effect of forskolin. but PKA-dependent signaling is unable to account for the enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Rap1 can cross-talk with PI3K signaling pathways in PKA-independent manners (150, 584, 687, 710, 711, 1173) rapid induction of PI3K by forskolin was retained for several minutes matching the kinetics of pAkt Ser473 during this stimulation. PI3K inhibition only accounting for 50% of Thr308 inhibition, suggesting involvement of a secondary kinase for this regulation and thus full activation of Akt activation of Akt is observed to propagate pro-survival signals by elevating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels to inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage. cAMP-mediated induction of CREB upregulates Bcl-2 expression (710) through CRE-binding elements in the Bcl-2 promoter (1122) the most associated phenotype is M1 macrophages, which are responsible for acute inflammation, including recruitment of neutrophils and employment of phagocytosis to clear foreign pathogens. the most associated phenotype is M2 macrophages, which are observed during the end of inflammation or during chronic inflammatory environments. opsins activate the phagocytic machinery in macrophages. the presence of this cAMP effector may be important to phagocytic pathways. in macrophages undergoing complement-mediated phagocytosis, serum-opsonized particle uptake is enhanced. EPAC/Rap1 phagocytosis does not utilize known RhoA downstream kinases, ROCK and LIMK (LIM domain kinase), to phosphorylate cofilin and form filaments. RIAM expression is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages, and this protein is found to be essential in Rap1-regulated phagocytosis. cross-talk between Rap1 signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present. redundancy between such signaling systems or divergence for specialized use of RhoA versus EPAC/Rap1 signaling in this context remains to be explored. altered Rap1 expression does not affect FcR-mediated phagocytosis. further support for Rap1-independent suppression of phagocytosis is observed with the localization of EPAC1 and Rap1 in the presence of PGE2. PGE2 inhibits activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in alveolar macrophages in a PTEN-dependent manner. blocking PTEN rescues phagocytosis and bacterial killing from PGE2/EPAC-dependent suppression. tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN is inversely correlated with enhanced PTEN lipid phosphatase activity. activity to induce massive influx of cAMP after 6\u201324 h would be anticipated to act on cAMP effectors such as PKA and EPAC to enact the toxin\u2019s effect in the cell. edema toxin reduced ingestion of E. coli to similar degree as another toxin, cytochalasin B, that disrupts actin filaments. Edema toxin treatment also supports the action of EPAC and PKA in attenuating phagocytosis. effect of EPAC inhibitors in animal models exhibiting suppressed macrophage functions could be interesting to investigate and restore partial macrophage functions. phagocytosis in mouse macrophage cells induces superoxide production to generate an oxidative burst. genetic deletion of RhoA or Rap1 attenuates superoxide production 40%. treatment with EPAC agonist was observed to augment superoxide production beyond control levels in presence of IgG-opsonized particles (521, 609) in this signaling system, the sole knockdown of Vav2 by siRNA effectively reduced Rac1 activation by EPAC/Rap1 suggesting Vav2 as the major Rac1 GEF in this process (609) increasing levels of RhoA phosphorylation and RhoA-RhoGDI complexes are observed that are connected to competitive relief in RhoGDI binding of Rac1 (98, 609, 879) treatment in cancer biology may benefit from applying findings to tumor-associated macrophages to enhance re-education to M1 phenotypes and FcR-mediated phagocytosis by EPAC inhibition. dendritic cells are uniquely poised between the innate and adaptive immune responses patrolling the body in search of foreign antigens. a variety of cAMP stimulating ligands potentiate the maturation of DCs. several hallmarks of proper execution include upregulation of costimulatory and antigen presenting molecules on the cell surface. a cAMP-responsive element is located within the CXCR4 promoter producing a prime target for CREB. EPAC activation in tandem with PKA suppresses CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. but random migration and chemokinesis are unaffected by the action of EPAC. the function of EPAC in DC migration should not be completely dismissed. denosine induced signaling relies on Rap1 to initiate disruption of the immune synapse between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and Treg cells (396) these results may suggest differential roles of Rap1 dependent on initiating and ongoing signals to alter cellular function. however, whether these signals result in feedback mechanisms to avoid oversuppression or mechanisms to ensure adequate timing and efficiency for Treg cells to modulate larger populations of DCs remains to be elucidated. the role of PKA activity in this process is attenuation of TNF-, TGF-, IL-18, and IL-10 mRNA transcription. cotreatment with EPAC agonist selectively reversed only expression of IL-10 and IL-18 partially, again suggesting that only some of the PKA-regulated pathways are also sensitive to EPAC. IP1/ promoters attenuates transcription (478, 479) together, these results implicate EPAC activation in suppression of chemokine expression and release, promoting anti-inflammatory signaling. in this case, activation of EP4 receptors in LPS- or TNF-stimulated DCs promotes EPAC and PKA mediated phosphorylation of C/EBP and CREB. investigation into the regulatory mechanism of these PG receptors on IL-23 production revealed a dose-dependent signaling pathway. the induction of IL-23 is completely abolished with the addition of EP2 agonist or simply increasing PGE2 to relevant physiological levels between 50 and 100 nM. downstream effectors PKA and EPAC were again implicated in the regulation of these chemokines. cAMP is one of a plethora of signals being integrated by DCs during the maturation process. selective activation of EPAC could lead to tolerance induction and attenuate allergic and autoimmune disorders. in the development of ex vivo conditioning strategies for cancer vaccines and immunotherapy, enhancement of DC maturation by PKA activation may be further augmented. involvement of T-cell receptors with antigen presentation of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules initiates T-cell differentiation into one of several subtypes depending on the cytokines, chemokines, and soluble lipid molecules secreted by the APCs during this process. following the induction of T cells there is a period of cellular contraction through controlled cell death. c-Jun activation was also involved in induction of p38 phosphorylation in leukocytes. c-Jun activation was also involved in induction of p38 phosphorylation in leukocytes. the regulators of gene transcription by EPAC are not fully established. cAMP elevation in this tissue coincides with reduced IL-13 and IFN- production in wild-type splenocytes to maintain inflammatory status quo. but knockout of the EP2 receptor for PGE2 increases the expression of these cytokines, signifying an enhanced inflammatory response. cholera toxin promotes induction of cAMP in Jurkat and CD4+ T cells. cAMP-dependent effect was observed during differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 cells in response to PGE2 or Leishmania donovani stimulation (895, 1056) this suggests cAMP may have distinct roles in the differentiation or activation of Th17 cells dependent on the maturity of the cell. this could introduce a potentially valid approach to suppress autoimmune disorders, host defensive against organ transplant or rejection of primed T-cell immunotherapy. authors dismiss redundant mechanism of PKA through inducible cAMP early repressor. inhibition of STAT3 restores Treg suppression even in the absence of EPAC1. this is consistent with reports of negative regulation of STAT3 by EPAC/SOCS3 in non-immune cells. regulators in this pathway are still currently under investigation. the controlled death of autoreactive and chronically active T cells is also important to the peripheral tolerance of the host to attenuate autoimmunity. this process is tightly controlled through the activation-induced cell death (AICD) process and is invoked by interaction of Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L) with Fas receptor (CD95) to form the death-inducing signaling complex. the precise mechanism by which EPAC can influence PKA-mediated CD95L/FasL induction remains to be defined as in many signaling pathways. autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes exhibit increased PGE2 (159, 332, 551) and reduced CD95L/FasL levels. cAMP is implicated in the shift of balance towards cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in immature B cells. direct stimulation of AC by forskolin replicated the processes induced by BCR ligation. cAMP exhibits conflicting effects on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt Ser473. activation of EPAC alone is enough to induce Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. but the action of EPAC in growth arrest and apoptosis is only observed in presence of -IgM-induced BCR ligation. this suggests that -IgM-induced BCR ligation induces not only the cAMP/EPAC/Rap signaling cascade. divergent signaling is observed in B cells and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells as compared with other cell types including T cells (1030). the anti-apoptotic effect is predominantly dependent on PDE4 while other isoforms, such as PDE3, may work loosely in tandem with PDE4 (721, 726). the purpose of increased EPAC1 transcripts in these B-CLL cells is unclear. potential agents targeting such discrepancies could be vital in development of future targeted-therapeutic strategies. increased levels of cAMP induce enhanced neurotransmission from presynaptic terminals (599, 1111) loss of different PKA subunits in neurons did not drastically affect basal level of transmission (101) the role of EPAC versus PKA in vesicle release remains controversial. EPAC-specific activator increased EPSC levels, supporting the importance of EPAC as a major regulator in synaptic vesicle release (490). a potential mechanism for EPAC to increase neurotransmitter release involves the known association between the NH2 terminus of EPAC2 and RIM proteins. a more recent account supports the role of EPAC in enhancing glutamate release in direct correlation to Munc13\u20131 translocation. this translocation involves the activation of PLC to hydrolyze PIP2 and generate DAG which activates and redistributes Munc13\u20131 to the active zone. however, the complete function of EPAC in neurotransmitter release may be more complex than a single mechanism of action. forskolin-induced EPSCs are unaffected by the loss of RIM. the role of EPAC in neuropeptide release in other neurons was investigated. a genetically altered fly line harboring a P-element insertion in the CNB domain did not exhibit diminished neurotransmission in motor neurons (945) brefeldin A, a lactone metabolite produced by Eupenicillium brefeldianum, inhibits a high-molecular-weight Golgi-associated ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GBF1 (772) new chemical inhibitors that are selective for EPAC have become more readily available. the mouse exhibits impaired LTP paired with spatial learning and social interaction abnormalities. the induction of the action potential is a key characteristic of neuronal transmission. in the presence of nerve growth factor, sensory neurons demonstrate increased expression of EPAC2 while EPAC1 levels remain constant. calcium activates calcium-sensitive big potassium channels, an ion channel commonly associated with PKA activation. the channel is activated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) treatment of neurons comprising the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus increasing neuronal electrical activity. this channel is potentially blocked by inhibition of EPAC or PKA. the function of elevated cAMP to induce neuritogenesis is no secret. axonal regeneration in DRG neurons (129, 746) and neurite extension in PC12 (170, 185, 519) have been attributed to both the effects of PKA and EPAC. the inhibition of both isoforms of EPAC, but not EPAC2 alone could reduce the essential Rap1B activity and formation of axons in cultured hippocampal neurons. this would suggest that during axon specification, EPAC1 may be the main activator of Rap1B (744) other downstream effectors of EPAC that are activated by Rap1- and Rap2-independent mechanisms are also important to axonal growth. a coordinated action between the cAMP-independent NGF activation of ERK and EPAC2 induction of p38 MAPK provokes growth arrest and neuritogenic effects. enhanced EPAC1 expression in neonatal neurons facilitated 007-mediated attraction of growth cone extensions. a distinct role for EPAC2 on the promotion of neurite outgrowth is supported. -amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) affects spine reduction and internalization of -amino-3-hydroxyl-5-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) this action may be coordinated by interaction of EPAC2 with neuroligin, which recruits EPAC2 to the membrane and enhances the GEF activity (FIGURE 8). KA and EPAC effectively reduces neurite outgrowth. authors propose EPAC \u201ctakes over\u201d cAMP signaling and promotes neurite outgrowth. additional support for the importance of EPAC2 to astrocyte differentiation is observed in EPAC2 knockout mice. cAMP and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) gene expression was involved in the PACAP-38-mediated differentiation process. andamaged membranes (263, 970) through myelin delamination (52) and calcium-dependent accumulation of vesicles and undamaged membrane (262, 558, 858, 1031) the loss of such an important regulator should manifest abnormalities in behavior of EPAC null animals. the full extent of EPAC functions in neurological behaviors is only beginning to be appreciated. synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus has been attributed to the action of ERK on protein translation to form subsequent long-term memories (514) stimulation of hippocampal slices with an EPAC agonist leads to increased LTP stability and activation of ERK (343, 514) loss of EPAC2 could impair LTD in the hippocampus. amine-induced model to inhibit miR-124 was found to mimic the mice defects. single knockout of EPAC1 or EPAC2 was not sufficient to induce the defects in learning and socialization. there is slight controversy within the animal models however. activation of EPAC was found to reduce leptin signaling by attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation and inducing suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). further support of these results is demonstrated in nodose ganglia neurons where ghrelin inhibits leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation through induction of SOCS3. d and the Gs-protein heterotrimer dissociates into Gs subunits to effectively activate ACs raising intracellular cAMP concentrations. increased levels of cAMP induce enhanced neurotransmission from presynaptic terminals (599, 1111) loss of different PKA subunits in neurons did not drastically affect basal level of transmission (101) the role of EPAC versus PKA in vesicle release remains controversial. treatment with forskolin demonstrated the involvement of cAMP in increasing both parameters. further inquiry into the precise mechanism revealed that PKA inhibitors had no effect on EPSC generation. EPAC activation could prevent presynaptic silencing, as well as accelerate awakening, of axonal terminals. a more recent account supports the role of EPAC in enhancing glutamate release in direct correlation to Munc13\u20131 translocation. this translocation involves the activation of PLC to hydrolyze PIP2 and generate DAG which activates and redistributes Munc13\u20131 to the active zone. however, the complete function of EPAC in neurotransmitter release may be more complex than a single mechanism of action. more studies in the hippocampal regions of RIM1 knockout mice show that forskolin-induced EPSC are unaffected by the loss of RIM. however, Rim2 can act as a surrogate in the absence of RIM1 to propagate the signal through a redundant mechanism. the role of EPAC in neuropeptide release in other neurons was also investigated. feldin A treatment and HCN blockers were ineffective (445) discrepancies in the function of EPAC in neurotransmitter release and potentiation could represent the use of brefeldin A as an EPAC inhibitor (1204). new chemical inhibitors that are selective for EPAC have become more readily available and could assist in clarifying functional roles for EPAC in neurons. induction of action potential is key characteristic of neuronal transmission. the induction of the action potential is a key characteristic of neuronal transmission. the induction of the action potential is a key characteristic of neuronal transmission. in cerebellar granule cells, EPAC2 activation is found to enhance Rap and p38 activation to mobilize intracellular calcium, which in turn activates calcium-sensitive big potassium channels. the function of EPAC extends further to inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels leading to greater neuronal excitability (707). the development of the EPAC-selective activator 007 has proven to be instrumental in the determination of EPAC\u2019s function in neurotransmitter release. independent research groups treated the presynaptic neuron of the calyx of Held with either forskolin, an EPAC-specific agonist, or cAMP alone. long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and granule cells from EPAC-null mice rapidly decayed to basal levels after only 30 min of tetanus. a potential mechanism for EPAC to increase neurotransmitter release involves the known association between the NH2 terminus of EPAC2 and RIM proteins. EPAC activation increased RIM1 association with Rab3A to shift vesicles closer to the presynaptic membrane as shown by electron microscopy (300). however, the complete function of EPAC in neurotransmitter release may be more complex than a single mechanism of action. forskolin, PKA, and EPAC activators enhanced neuropeptide release. but the use of a genetically altered fly line harboring a P-element insertion in the CNB domain did not exhibit diminished forskolin-induced neurotransmission in motor neurons. a selective EPAC agonist only partially rescues the diminished synaptic transmission. mossy fiber CA3 synapses in the hippocampus have unaffected basal activity and short trains of synaptic transmission. long-term activity and forskolin-dependent potentiation were impaired in the absence of EPAC. the induction of the action potential is a key characteristic of neuronal transmission. the induction of the action potential is a key characteristic of neuronal transmission. the induction and maintenance of these membrane potentials are accomplished through voltage-gated ion channels. ion channel regulated by both cAMP sensors is the fast-delayed rectifier potassium channel Kv3. this channel is activated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) treatment of neurons comprising the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus increasing neuronal electrical activity. this channel is potentially blocked by inhibition of EPAC or PKA (562) studies selectively activating the two cAMP effectors have begun to shed light on the individual functions of these proteins. expression of EPAC1 and EPAC2 isoforms is developmentally regulated in the rat nervous system. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and microtubule growth (423, 930, 954) are also important to axonal growth. a coordinated action between the cAMP-independent NGF activation of ERK and EPAC2 induction of p38 MAPK provokes growth arrest and neuritogenic effects. a distinct role for EPAC2 on the promotion of neurite outgrowth is supported. expression of EPAC1 in early neurons contributes to the development of the primary axon. mature neurons elevate the levels of EPAC2 to modulate dendrite stability and outgrowth. the expression of a rare EPAC2 mutation in the RA domain found in several autistic patients established the maintenance of basal dendrites to be a function of EPAC2. this mutation effectively decreased the number and length of basal dendrites that was linked to the action of EPAC2 through a Ras-mediated pathway (975) controversy still exists between the effects of PKA versus EPAC in neurite development. pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP-38) is the ligand of a GPCR, PAC1, which activates AC. the potent PACAP-38 stimulation of neurite outgrowth was found to be mimicked by forskolin treatment. however, PKA inhibition was unable to affect the differentiation. ation of both pathways was a viable option to induce differentiation. additional support for the importance of EPAC2 to astrocyte differentiation is observed in EPAC2 knockout mice. another Ras-like small GTP binding protein, Rin, was also implicated in the PACAP-38-mediated differentiation process. the full extent of EPAC functions in neurological behaviors is only beginning to be appreciated. for some time, the role of cAMP in learning and memory in mammals has been reported (114, 313) supporting the requirement for cAMP, forskolin treatment can rescue long-term memory in mice lacking AC1 and AC8 (1124) a similar formation of long-term odor memory in rats was observed to be enhanced by the activation of an EPAC/ERK pathway. another study also concluded that loss of EPAC2 could impair LTD in the hippocampus. impairment of fear memory by PKA inhibition is rescued by cotreatment of the EPAC activator, suggesting EPAC can function independent of PKA. two-photon imaging showed defective spine development in cortical neurons presenting an issue at the synaptic level. deficiency in neuroligin-3 (NL-3) leads to autism-spectrum disorders (462). some reasons for such discrepancies could be linked to the mouse genetic backgrounds, investigated brain region, or redundant mechanisms of EPAC1. the actions of EPAC in the CNS are being established at a molecular level and being linked to physiological phenotypes observed in genetically altered animals. for some time, the role of cAMP in learning and memory in mammals has been reported (114, 313) implication of EPAC in memory formation involves EPAC\u2019s role in neurite outgrowth and plasticity. synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus has been attributed to the action of ERK on protein translation to form subsequent long-term memories. gene deletion of Zif-268 revealed severe defects in learning and socialization. genetic suppression of miR-124 or pharmacological treatment of scopolamine-treated rats with melatonin successfully reversed apparent neurological disorders. overinduction of miRNA-124 was found to mimic the EPAC-null mice defects. PAC1 knockout mice have reduced food intake resulting in decreased body weight (1150) the combination of genetic and pharmacological manipulations of EPAC1 demonstrate the importance of this cAMP-signal modulator in energy homeostasis and leptin signaling. EPAC1 expression is markedly upregulated, defining a role for the cAMP effector in cardiac function (692) in human cardiac tissue from heart failure patients, EPAC1 expression is markedly upregulated, defining a role for the cAMP effector in cardiac function. a concurrent, independent investigation of the function of the two EPAC isoforms in the intact animal demonstrated a role of EPAC2 in this pathology (819). inhibition of an EPAC isoform is beneficial to protect from cardiac stresses. cAMP plays a crucial role in regulating endothelial permeability and barrier functions as well as modulating vascular contraction/relaxation. vascular pressure and tone will be examined within context of overall cAMP signaling in vascular regulation. cAMP sensors, PKA and EPAC/Rap1, decreasing contractile force generated by RhoA and inducing arterial relaxation. major mechanisms used by cAMP signaling to attenuate contraction include direct inhibition of RhoA through Ser188 phosphorylation (272, 749), reduction of intracellular calcium influx from the SR (208), or ca2+ desensitization of the contractile machinery through telokin phosphorylation. EPAC1 was found to immunoprecipitate SUR2B, a regulatory subunit of the KATP. the suppressive action of EPAC on KATP is only observed in the absence of PKA activation. these results suggest that the physiological function of EPAC on potassium current is more likely. Rap1B-null mice exhibit reduced vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) stimulation of eNOS and subsequent NO generation promoting the development of hypertension. agonist stimulation promotes EPAC2 translocation to the membrane fraction. PAC stimulates ANP secretion downstream of GLP-1R agonists. these results suggest that agonists induce EPAC2 and potentially cross-talk with PLC pathways to promote ANP secretion and subsequent vasodilation to reduce blood pressure. the cell surface was observed in the presence of elevated cAMP levels, direct EPAC activation, or expression of constitutively active Rap1A. the activation of EPAC and cAMP elevation was accomplished by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and increased F-actin, which are lost with treatment of actin destabilizing agents. the retention of barrier integrity is of utmost importance to the vasculature to maintain proper pressure control, transport of macromolecules and solutes. the functional role of EPAC in regulating the tightness of the endothelial barrier is receiving greater attention. two very recent accounts describe the function of EPAC isoforms in microvascular permeability. the first study demonstrated that loss of EPAC1 increased baseline permeability observed as increased transvascular transport of radiolabeled albumin. vascular permeability induced by ANP was attenuated in EPAC1-null mice. in VSMCs, suppressive signal to reduce proliferation is attributed to cAMP inhibition of cell-cycle regulators, cyclin D and Skp2. early reports describing PKA as the likely cAMP effector (456, 572, 1134) however, further investigation revealed that PKA inhibition incompletely restores Skp2 expression after cAMP stimulation. cAMP-mediated cell-cycle arrest in VSMCs appears to be a combination of effects facilitated by EPAC and PKA to alter transcriptional regulation of mitogenic genes. however, the mechanism of overlapping regulatory roles for EPAC and PKA in these pathways requires more experimentation to be fully defined. in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) activation of EPAC or Rap1 attenuates VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. one action of Id1 is to enhance tumor angiogenesis through suppression angiogenetic inhibitor thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) (644, 645, 1076) cAMP enlists functional pathways of both EPAC and PKA to induce vasorelaxation and oppose RhoA-mediated contraction. this process involves modulation of both vascular smooth muscle cytoskeletal mechanics as well as endothelial secretion of vasodilatory molecules to enhance the relaxant effect. vascular cells invert the function of EPAC/Rap1 to attenuate angiogenesis. further investigation into influences derived from the microenvironment and vascular bed may provide fresh insight for this versatile cAMP cascade. compared with many other organ systems, functional roles for EPAC in the cardiovascular system are well-studied. EPAC1-null mice exhibit resistance to several induced cardiac stresses. EPAC2 deletion did not display cardioprotective features (785) inhibition of an EPAC isoform is beneficial to protect from cardiac stresses. intracellular cAMP signaling is commonly observed to invoke vasorelaxation in large vessels through inhibition of RhoA signaling (1213) inhibition of RhoA is accomplished by downstream actions of cAMP sensors, PKA and EPAC/Rap1, decreasing contractile force generated by RhoA and inducing arterial relaxation. the suppressive action of EPAC on KATP is only observed in the absence of PKA activation. both EPAC and PKA activation are also observed to slowly leak cytosolic Ca2+ from the SR reducing the SR load and attenuating contraction. EPAC/Rap1B downregulates RhoA signaling to induce relaxation in these vessels, contributing, in part, to hypertension in Rap1B-null mice (577). both PKA and EPAC were determined to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increasing nitric oxide production by 14 and 15%, leading to enhanced relaxation of the overlying muscle (336, 878) agonist stimulation promotes EPAC2 translocation to the membrane fraction. in the absence of GLP-1Rs direct activation of EPAC stimulates ANP secretion. this suggests that EPAC2 functions downstream of GLP-1R to enhance ANP secretion. translocation of 2c-adrenoreceptors to the cell surface was accomplished by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and increased F-actin. a followup study found a specific interaction between the COOH terminus of 2c-adrenoreceptors and filamin-2, an actin cross-linker, using yeast-two hybrid screening (737). the retention of barrier integrity is of utmost importance to the vasculature. the functional role of EPAC in regulating the tightness of the endothelial barrier is receiving greater attention as tools to probe functions have become available. two very recent accounts describe the function of EPAC isoforms in microvascular permeability. vascular permeability induced by ANP was attenuated in EPAC1-null mice, while wild-type and EPAC2-null animals remained sensitive to ANP stimulation. suppressive signal to reduce proliferation is attributed to cAMP inhibition of cell-cycle regulators, cyclin D and Skp2. however, further investigation revealed that PKA inhibition incompletely restores Skp2 expression after cAMP stimulation. however, further investigation revealed that PKA inhibition incompletely restores Skp2 expression after cAMP stimulation. cAMP-mediated cell-cycle arrest in VSMCs appears to be a combination of effects facilitated by EPAC and PKA to alter transcriptional regulation of mitogenic genes. proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells is crucial for the angiogenesis process that is important to wound healing and promoting blood flow to hypoxic tissues. the functional consequence of Rap1 deletion leads to the thought that EPAC may also participate in angiogenesis through Rap1 signaling. initial studies focusing on the angiogenesis of tumors found that in human microvascular endothelial cells activation of EPAC or Rap1 attenuates VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. cAMP enlists functional pathways of both EPAC and PKA to induce vasorelaxation and oppose RhoA-mediated contraction. this process involves modulation of both vascular smooth muscle cytoskeletal mechanics as well as endothelial secretion of vasodilatory molecules to enhance the relaxant effect. the function of EPAC/Rap1 appears to switch to support RhoA activation. stress conditions in microvascular cells invert function of EPAC/Rap1 to attenuate angiogenesis. stress conditions in microvascular cells invert function of EPAC/Rap1 to attenuate angiogenesis; thus further investigation into influences derived from the microenvironment and vascular bed may provide fresh insight. increased Rap1 activity provides another mechanism to decrease RhoA activity concurrent with reduction in RLC20 and MLCP phosphorylation independent of PKA. the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels and consequent modulation of potassium current by EPAC are also pertinent to the relaxation of VSMCs. cAMP/EPAC-mediated vascular relaxation was observed to be functionally deficient in the absence of Rap1B. both EPAC and PKA were determined to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increasing nitric oxide production by 14 and 15%, respectively, and leading to enhanced relaxation of the overlying muscle. 1B-null mice exhibit reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation of eNOS and subsequent NO generation promoting the development of hypertension. results demonstrate an independent pathway for EPAC/Rap1 that cooperates with PKA to relax smooth muscle cells exposed to increasing cAMP levels. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also have a favorable effect in reducing hypertension (963) the role of EPAC1 and the extent of PLC function in this secretory pathway remains to be determined. external stimuli that induce strain on the vascular system may also affect the outcome of cAMP signaling. the involvement of EPAC in stress-induced vasoconstriction of human dermal arterioles was investigated. implication of inverted role of EPAC/Rap1 in microvascular smooth muscles during stress. inhibition of RhoA or downstream Rho-associated protein kinase, ROCK, arrested the EPAC/Rap1A-dependent F-actin enhancement (472) vascular endothelial cells, Rap1 is associated with in cell-cell contacts. loss of Rap1 activity results in attenuation of endothelial adhesion with gap formation. treatment of these cells with 007 rapidly restores endothelial junctions implicating EPAC in this pathway. density of junctions in EPAC1-knockout endothelial cells suggests reduced adhesion. thus EPAC1 appears to be the responsible isoform for basal microvascular integrity. another investigation focused on hyperpermeability induced by ischemia-reperfusion. cAMP-mediated growth arrest in VSMCs appears to be a combination of effects facilitated by both EPAC and PKA to alter transcriptional regulation of mitogenic genes. however, the mechanism of overlapping regulatory roles for EPAC and PKA in these pathways requires more experimentation to be fully defined. disrupted signaling can lead to either insufficient or excessive signaling. the temporal activation and suppression of this signaling system is important to maintain low proliferation rates until injury stimuli are present. activation of EPAC in endothelial cells attenuated VEGF induction of Id1 to increase TSP1 expression. the inhibitory signal of EPAC/Rap1 is abolished when TSP1 signaling is blocked, supporting TSP1 induction as the culprit in EPAC/Rap1 suppression of angiogenesis (248). cAMP enlists functional pathways of both EPAC and PKA to induce vasorelaxation and oppose RhoA-mediated contraction. under normal physiological conditions, cAMP enlists functional pathways of both EPAC and PKA to induce vasorelaxation. this process involves modulation of both vascular smooth muscle cytoskeletal mechanics as well as endothelial secretion of vasodilatory molecules to enhance the relaxant effect. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis covers the functions of three endocrine glands, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal gland. the HPA axis is a major neuroendocrine system that controls many physiological processes and stress responses. agents can impair leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic brain slices. this inhibity effect of cAMP is not affected by PKA inhibition. this suggests a potential PKA-independent event. cAMP inhibits leptin-evoked depolarization of POMC neurons. the effects of EPAC on leptin signaling in the hypothalamus are most likely mediated by the small GTPase Rap1. loss of neuronal Rap1 also protects against diet-induced obesity, glucose imbalance, and insulin resistance in the periphery. cAMP-stimulated proglucagon mRNA expression is reported to be mediated by the activation of EPAC, but not PKA. inhibition of EPAC proteins alleviates melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R)-induced CRE reporter activation. suppressing PKA activity has only weak or no effect on reporter gene expression in hypothalamic cell lines. PAC, likely EPAC2, has been shown to enhance the Ca2+-dependent secretory activity in mouse melanotrophs, neuroendocrine cells from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary that secrete -MSH and -endorphin. the use of pharmacological agents selective for EPAC or PKA further demonstrated that EPAC activation boosts the exocytosis of low Ca2+ threshold, ATP-independent, and release-ready vesic similar mitogenic effects are observed in corresponding pituitary cell lines. similar effects are observed in corresponding immortalized pituitary cells. cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in response to trophic hormones is largely mediated. a genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis for shifting mRNA expression in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in mouse adrenal Y1 cells revealed that PKA activation is responsible for 56% of the ACTH transcriptional modulations. a large portion (38%) of ACTH-mediated transcription remains unaccounted for. cAMP inhibition partially blocks cAMP-induced aldosterone production. but activation of EPAC/Rap1/2 by 007 does not affect aldosterone secretion. cAMP effector involved in modulating caMK activity and aldosterone secretion. in AZF cells, ACTH acutely inhibits TREK-1 current. cAMP analogs does not require PKA activation as TREK-1 inhibition caused by cAMP inhibition by H-89, Rp-cAMP, or PKI has no effect on TREK-1 inhibition caused by N6-substituted cAMP analogs (626). these findings again point to the potential involvement of an unknown mediator associated with cAMP-related functions in adrenal cells. thyrocytes where the major function of TSH is to increase intracellular cAMP. expression of EPAC1 protein is also detected in basal or stimulated dog thyrocytes. despite the high EPAC1 expression and TSH responsiveness of mRNA levels, cAMP analogs appear to mimic all tested cAMP-dependent functions of TSH. EPAC1 and PKA synergistically activate EPAC1-associated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and promote dephosphorylation of Akt (433). abnormal dysregulation of cAMP signaling caused by activating mutations in the thyrotropin receptor or in the corresponding Gs subunit is responsible for 80% of the autonomous or hot adenomas, but not in cold thyroid follicular adenomas. ovarian follicles are tightly regulated by pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (871) the binding of FSH and LH to their cognate GPCRs activates AC and stimulates the production of cAMP in ovarian granulosa cells, where both EPAC1 and 2 are expressed. cAMP-induced progesterone secretion is mediated by both PKA and EPAC1. granulosa cell-derived ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (KITLG) is important for oogenesis and folliculogenesis. incubation of boar spermatozoa in capacitating conditions promotes accumulation of EPAC1 staining in the connection piece between the tail and head. 007 treatment promotes calcium mobilization, sperm motility, acrosome reaction, and plasma membrane phospholipids scrambling to colocalize with EPAC1. cAMP/EPAC-elicited acrosome reaction is insensitive to PKA inhibition. can be blocked by antibodies against components of the vesicle fusion machinery. bifurcated signaling pathway initiated by activation of soluble ACs and EPAC proteins. cAMP-induced functional differentiation and syncytialization of human trophoblasts is mediated by the EPAC signaling pathway (1174) the importance of EPAC signaling in differentiation of the STB is further validated by two independent studies demonstrating that EPAC/Rap1 activation stimulates placental cell fusion in a PKA-independent. the pancreas is a major endocrine organ producing several important hormones including insulin and glucagon that are critical for glucose and energy homeostasis. the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ stimulates the fusion of insulin granules and ultimately increases the rate of insulin release (546) GSIS is strongly potentiated by incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which bind to their receptor on the surface of pancreatic -cells to stimulate cAMP production (256, 291, 827). Senio and co-workers first demonstrated a direct role of EPAC2 in regulating exocytosis and incretin-potentiated insulin secretion by 2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) is mediated by EPAC2 and not PKA (491) studies based on PLC- knockout mice indicate that EPAC2 stimulates IP3R-mediated Ca2+ mobilization through activation of PLC- (260) calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), acting downstream of PKA, is also involved in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in INS-1 cells (1212). silencing of EPAC2 or its interacting partners, Rim2 or Rab3A, obliterates the stimulatory effect of GLP-1 on glucose uptake, cellular ATP levels, and GK activity in INS-1 cells. results suggest that GLP-1 can act through EPAC2 to further potentiate GSIS by stimulating GK activity and glucose metabolism (803) intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT) shows slightly increased insulin sensitivity in EPAC2A/ mice as compared with wild-type animals. deletion of EPAC2A resulted in reduced GSIS and impaired glucose tolerance following a 4-wk HFD feeding regimen. in mouse and human islets, EPAC2 is expressed at significantly higher levels than EPAC1. it is accepted as the main isoform that mediates the function of EPAC in regulating insulin secretion. however, islets isolated from EPAC1 knockout mice exert impaired GSIS despite normal basal insulin secretion. arginine residue (R448) at the switch-board region COOH terminal was identified to be critical for the interaction with sulfonylureas (412) this residue is 40 away from the R448 residue implicated previously for sulfonylurea interaction (412). biochemical studies from two independent groups employing purified recombinant full-length EPAC2 conclude that sulfonylureas are not able to bind and activate EPAC glucagon, secreted predominantly from -cells in pancreatic islets, is the most important hyperglycemic hormone. the expression and secretion of glucagon is tightly regulated by neuronal and hormonal inputs. glucagon release in mouse and rat -cells can also be regulated in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. cAMP activation promotes proglucagon gene (Gcg) transcription and glucagon production, but not glucagon secretion. low intracellular cAMP mimics the inhibitory effect of GLP-1 on glucagon secretion. high cAMP levels, generated by high potency activators, promote glucagon secretion. cAMP signaling is known to regulate expression of Gcg in pancreatic -cells, intestinal endocrine L cells, and certain brain neuroendocrine cells. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to regulate Gcg expression by stimulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Cdx-2 expression. ectopic expression of either dominant negative or constitutively active form of EPAC2 suppresses Gcg expression. previously observed inhibitory effects of dominant negative EPAC2 on Gcg expression were likely caused by nonspecific suppression by overexpressing EPAC2. these results challenge notion that EPAC2 is involved in cAMP-mediated stimulation of Gcg expression. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis covers the functions of three endocrine glands, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal gland, as well as their interactions. the hypothalamus incorporates information from various sensory pathways and controls many physiological functions including appetite, energy balance, and circadian rhythms. eptin and the gastrointestinally derived orexigenic hormone ghrelin act in the hypothalamus to antagonistically regulate energy homeostasis (543, 755, 1055, 1196) cAMP-elevating agents can impair leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic brain slices. cAMP-elevating agents can impair leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic brain slices mice with cAMP-mediated leptin resistance display enhanced hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. mice also exhibit reduced food intake, white adipose tissue and plasma leptin levels. pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 by the EPAC-selective inhibitor ESI-09 reduces plasma leptin levels in vivo. whole-body deletion of EPAC2A induces an impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling, early-onset increases in plasma leptin levels, and decreases in plasma adiponectin levels. a recent study of EPAC2/ mice demonstrates a protective role of EPAC2 against obesity. this suggests a protective role of EPAC2 against obesity. EPAC inhibition mitigates -MSH-induced expression of c-fos and thyrotropin-releasing hormone mRNA. inhibition of PKA blocks TRH expression alone. cAMP signaling is previously reported to perform vital roles in various pituitary functions. cAMP promotes fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane by interaction with EPAC2/Rim2 (928) hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate pituitary cell functions by generating different intracellular second messengers. cAMP increases DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression in primary cells isolated from human somatotropinomas. EPAC2B retains the ability to activate downstream effector Rap1 in a cAMP-dependent manner. ectopically expressed EPAC2B is primarily localized in cytosol and incapable of stimulating hormone secretion in response to increased intracellular cAMP in MIN6 cells (766) adrenal zona glomerulosa cells produce mineralocorticoids in response to extracellular stimuli such as ACTH, angiotensin II (ANG II) and extracellular potassium. cAMP-induced CaMK activation is mediated neither by PKA nor by EPAC in these cells. cAMP-induced aldosterone production is stimulated by ANG II, ACTH, and cAMP. cAMP-mediated inhibition of the adrenal TREK-1 channels is unaffected by inhibition of PKA. intracellular administration of a selective EPAC agonist, 007, mimics the effects of cAMP by inhibiting TREK-1 channel activation, in an EPAC2-dependent manner (625). cAMP inhibition by these cAMP analogs does not require PKA activation. activation of EPAC induces slower, more sustained ERK activation. hypothalamus incorporates information from various sensory pathways. hypothalamus controls energy homeostasis (543, 755, 1055, 1196) cAMP inhibits leptin signaling in hypothalamic brain slices. this inhibity effect of cAMP is not affected by PKA inhibition. pharmacological activation of the EPAC pathway in the hypothalamus leads to attenuation of leptin signaling. a recent study of EPAC2/ mice demonstrates whole-body deletion of EPAC2A induces an impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling, early-onset increases in plasma leptin levels, and decreases in plasma adiponectin levels. the findings suggest a protective role of EPAC2 against obesity. the phenotype resulting from whole-body EPAC2 is mediated by the small GTPase Rap1. cAMP-stimulated proglucagon mRNA expression is reported to be mediated by the activation of EPAC, but not PKA. inhibition of EPAC proteins alleviates melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R)-induced CRE reporter activation. suppressing PKA activity has only weak or no effect on reporter gene expression in hypothalamic cell lines. hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate pituitary cell functions by generating different intracellular second messengers. hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate pituitary cell functions by generating different intracellular second messengers. hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate pituitary cell functions by generating different intracellular second messengers, including cAMP. similar mitogenic effects are observed in corresponding pituitary cell lines. similar effects are observed in corresponding immortalized pituitary cells. cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in response to trophic hormones is largely mediated by the action of PKA. a genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis for shifting mRNA expression in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in mouse adrenal Y1 cells revealed that PKA activation is responsible for 56% of the ACTH transcriptional modulations. a large portion (38%) of ACTH-mediated transcription remains unaccounted for. inhibition partially blocks cAMP-induced aldosterone production. activation of EPAC/Rap1/2 by 007 does not affect aldosterone secretion. cAMP effector involved in modulating caMK activity and aldosterone secretion. extensive studies have been performed to study cAMP signaling using the PC12 cell. these findings again point to the potential involvement of an unknown mediator associated with cAMP-related functions in adrenal cells. cAMP is also implicated in thyrocytes where the major function of cAMP is thyrocytes. in primary cultures of canine thyrocytes, EPAC1 mRNA is highly expressed. this expression is further enhanced in response to TSH stimulation. EPAC2 mRNA is not detected by blotting analyses in basal or stimulated dog thyrocytes. a recent study suggests activation of EPAC, but not PKA, is responsible for TSH-stimulated efflux of taurine, a cellular osmolyte in rat thyrocytes. abnormal dysregulation of cAMP signaling caused by activating mutations in the thyrotropin receptor or in the corresponding Gs subunit is responsible for 80% of the autonomous or hot adenomas. ovarian follicles are tightly regulated by pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (871) the binding of FSH and LH to their cognate GPCRs activates AC and stimulates the production of cAMP in ovarian granulosa cells, where both EPAC1 and 2 are expressed. granulosa cell-derived ligand for receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (KITLG) is important for oocyte and follicle development. cAMP differentially regulates KITLG expression at different stages during folliculogenesis, but suppressing the ligand at the full-grown stage. cAMP plays critical roles in regulating sperm motility, capacitation, and acrosome reaction. incubation of boar spermatozoa in capacitating conditions promotes accumulation of EPAC1 staining in the connection piece between the tail and head. 007 treatment promotes calcium mobilization, sperm motility, acrosome reaction, plasma membrane phospholipids scrambling, and E-cadherin redistribution. cAMP/EPAC-elicited acrosome reaction is insensitive to PKA inhibition. it can be blocked by antibodies against components of the vesicle fusion machinery. a subsequent study further reveals a bifurcated signaling pathway initiated by activation of soluble ACs and EPAC proteins. activation is more predominantly involved in the production of hCG and progesterone. the cAMP-induced functional differentiation and syncytialization of human trophoblasts is mediated by the EPAC signaling pathway (1174) the importance of EPAC signaling in differentiation of the STB is further validated by two independent studies. ovarian follicles are tightly regulated by pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (871) the binding of FSH and LH to their cognate GPCRs activates AC and stimulates the production of cAMP in ovarian granulosa cells, where both EPAC1 and 2 are expressed. cAMP-induced progesterone secretion is mediated by both PKA and EPAC1. granulosa cell-derived ligand for receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (KITLG) is important for multiple aspects of oocyte and follicle development. incubation of boar spermatozoa in capacitating conditions promotes accumulation of EPAC1 staining in the connection piece between the tail and head. 007 treatment promotes calcium mobilization, sperm motility, acrosome reaction, plasma membrane phospholipids scrambling, and E-cadherin redistribution to colocalize with EPAC. the cAMP/EPAC-elicited acrosome reaction is insensitive to PKA inhibition. it can be blocked by antibodies against components of the vesicle fusion machinery. a subsequent study reveals a bifurcated signaling pathway initiated by the activation of soluble ACs and EPAC proteins. cAMP-induced functional differentiation and syncytialization of human trophoblasts is mediated by the EPAC signaling pathway (1174) the importance of EPAC signaling in differentiation of the STB is further validated by two independent studies demonstrating that EPAC/Rap1 activation stimulates placental cell fusion. the pancreas is a major endocrine organ producing several important hormones including insulin and glucagon that are critical for glucose and energy homeostasis. the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ stimulates the fusion of insulin granules and ultimately increases the rate of insulin release (546). cAMP signaling also play important role in regulating insulin secretion. GSIS is strongly potentiated by incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which bind to their receptor on the surface of pancreatic -cells. a direct interaction between EPAC2 and the NBF-1 domain of SUR1 has been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and affinity pull-down assay using recombinant EPAC2 and NBF-1 in rat INS-1 -cells, GLP-1-potentiated Ca2+ release (CICR) is mediated by EPAC2 and not PKA (491) studies based on PLC- knockout mice indicate that EPAC2 stimulates IP3R-mediated Ca2+ mobilization through activation of PLC- (260) calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), acting downstream of PKA, is also involved in GLP-1-induced insulin EPAC2 or its interacting partners, Rim2 or Rab3A, obliterates the stimulatory effect of GLP-1 on glucose uptake, cellular ATP levels, and GK activity in INS-1 cells. these results suggest that GLP-1 can act through EPAC2 to further potentiate GSIS by stimulating GK activity. an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipITT) shows slightly increased insulin sensitivity in EPAC2A/ mice as compared with wild-type animals. deletion of EPAC2A resulted in reduced GSIS and impaired glucose tolerance following a 4-wk HFD feeding regimen. mice have increased levels of plasma leptin (454), which can stimulate GLP-1 secretion from rodent and human intestinal L cells. sulfonylureas were capable of activating an EPAC2-based FRET sensor in cells. antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs promoted insulin secretion by directly binding to EPAC2 (1189). a sensor based on EPAC2 but not EPAC1 can be activated by sulfonylureas. an arginine residue (R448) at the switch-board region COOH terminal to the CBD-B in EPAC2 was identified to be critical for the interaction with sulfonylureas (412) biochemical studies from two independent groups employing purified recombinant full-length EPAC2 conclude that sulfonylure glibenclamide and tolbutamide were shown to neither increase insulin secretion, as anticipated if activating EPAC2 directly, nor increase amplification of insulin secretion produced by an EPAC activator. glucagon, secreted predominantly from -cells in pancreatic islets, is critical in metabolic homeostasis by countering the effects of insulin. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to stimulate the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulator Oct-1. cAMP promotes proglucagon gene (Gcg) transcription and glucagon production. low intracellular cAMP mimics the inhibitory effect of GLP-1 on glucagon secretion while high cAMP levels promote glucagon secretion. high glucose stimulation induces a significant upregulation of PC1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. activation of the bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1 or TGR5) increases hyperglycemia-induced PC1 expression. also promoting GLP-1 release via an EPAC-mediated, PKA-independent mechanism in pancreatic -cells. glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) comprises a biphasic release of insulin with a rapid burst of insulin during the initial phase, followed by a second attenuated, but more sustained insulin release. the second phase requires mobilization and subsequent priming of insulin vesicles to replenish the depleted RRP (987) affinity pull-down assay using recombinant EPAC2 and NBF-1. this interaction is inhibited by high cAMP concentrations (955) EPAC proteins act independently of PKA to mediate cAMP\u2019s inhibitory effect on the KATP in pancreatic -cells (492, 495). inhibition of PKA activity virtually abolished the action of EPAC-selective cAMP analogs to potentiate GSIS in human islets. this suggests a complex mechanism in which PKA activation is permissive for the glucose-dependent and EPAC-regulated insulin secretion in these islets. an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipITT) shows slightly increased insulin sensitivity in EPAC2A/ mice as compared with wild-type mice. the lack of EPAC2A had little impact on GSIS in lean mice, but deletion resulted in reduced GSIS. a potential explanation for this discrepancy is that EPAC2A/ mice exhibit improved insulin sensitivity. deletion of EPAC2A outside of the -cell may offset the effect of increased incretin levels on GSIS after an oGTT. antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs promoted insulin secretion by directly binding to EPAC2 (1189) only a sensor based on EPAC2 but not EPAC1 can be activated by sulfonylureas. arginine residue (R448) was identified to be critical for the interaction with sulfonylureas (412) recombinant full-length EPAC2 conclude that sulfonylureas are not able to bind and activate EPAC2 casting doubts on the direct interaction between EPAC2 and sulfonylureas (859, 1041). gliclazide, unlike tolbutamide and other sulfonylureas, was shown to be ineffective in activating EPAC2-FRET sensors (412, 1189) glucagon release in mouse and rat -cells can also be regulated in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. glucagon stimulates exocytosis in -cells by binding to glucagon receptor. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to stimulate the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulator Oct-1. glucagon and GLP-1, along with glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP), GLP-2, glicentin, and oxyntomodulin (OXM) are all produced from a common precursor, proglucagon via alternative processing by prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) in pancreatic -cells or PC1 in intestinal L cells. cAMP acts through EPAC2 to regulate Gcg expression by stimulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Cdx-2 expression. ectopic expression of either a dominant negative or constitutively active form of EPAC2 suppresses Gcg expression. previously observed inhibitory effects of dominant negative EPAC2 on Gcg expression were likely caused by nonspecific suppression by overexpressing EPAC2. ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone secreted from the endocrine cells of the stomach. glucagon stimulates ghrelin mRNA production and secretion by activating glucagon receptors. glucagon-induced ghrelin is independent of PKA activation, but requires EPAC signaling. salivary glands Saliva production is regulated by synergistic signaling cross-talk mediated by intracellular second messengers IP3 and cAMP. activation of -adrenergic receptor enhances P2X4R- or P2X7R-mediated intracellular calcium influx. however, enhancement of Ca2+ changes by EPAC activation with 007 suggests a potential function for EPAC in P2XR signaling. the cAMP-induced GEF activity toward Rap1 is retained. it is unclear whether the full-length version or the truncated liver-specific isoform of EPAC2 is predominant in the primary cilia of the cholangiocytes. epac and glucagon mediated hepatic signaling. glucagon increases intracellular cAMP and counters the effect of insulin. glucagon activates a PLC-dependent inwardly rectifying Ca2+ current and an AC-dependent outwardly rectifying Cl- current. inhibition of either Akt or JNK reverses the inhibitory effects of liver-specific EPAC2 on nitrite production and iNOS expression (1186). glucagon acting through cAMP negatively regulates IL-6-induced MAP kinase activation; however, this inhibitory effect appears to involve both EPAC and PKA (518). bile acids are known to produce both beneficial and harmful effects by activating distinct intracellular signaling pathways. protection of hepatocytes against cell death induced by hydrophobic bile acids (1102), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (604), and Fas ligand (304) can be attributed to cAMP signaling. Akt phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration may contribute to cytoprotective effects against statin-induced toxicity in hepatocytes. polarization of hepatocytes is important for separating apical and basolateral membrane domains and forming the bile canaliculus. taurocholate exerts its polarity-stimulating effect by increasing cellular cAMP and signals through EPAC/Rap1/MEK/LKB1/AMPK, but cholestasis is a pathological condition involving the impairment of bile secretion. glucagon and a 2 adrenergic agonist, salbutamol, increase intracellular cAMP. salbutamol promotes a microtubule-dependent and long-range trafficking of vesicles. perfused rat liver and in vivo alanine administration induces pancreatic glucagon secretion (1218). endocrine function of bile acids is mainly mediated through activation of plasma membrane and nuclear receptors. TGR5 is highly expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and intestine and more selectively activated by secondary bile acid. KA activation is involved but not sufficient to cause relaxation downstream of TGR5 activation (850). Earlier studies have established that glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) but not GLP-1, enhances PepT1-mediated peptide absorption in murine jejunum by a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway (201) pancreatic functions EPAC proteins, particularly EPAC2, are implicated in major regulatory functions related to the endocrine arm of the pancreas. the role of EPAC in zymogen secretion and activation in pancreatic acinar cells will be discussed below. zymogen pools regulate amylase secretion and zymogen activation. cAMP acts through EPAC and PKA independently to activate the RyRs. cAMP acts through EPAC and PKA independently to activate the RyRs. activation of -adrenergic receptor enhances intracellular calcium influx. enhancement of Ca2+ changes by cAMP modulators is largely mediated by PKA. suggests a potential function for EPAC in P2XR signaling (79) epac and glucagon mediated hepatic signaling. glucagon is an important hormone for maintaining glucose and energy homeostasis. glucagon increases intracellular cAMP and counters the effect of insulin. glucagon and cAMP suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and activity in hepatocytes through a PKA-independent mechanism that involves JNK. overexpression of the liver-specific EPAC2 isoform decreases iNOS expression and nitrite production induced by interleukin. the expression levels of SOcs3 mRNA in fasted mice increase significantly. glucagon/cAMP-dependent pathway negatively regulates the PKA-dependent pathway by inducing SOCS3. in the liver, bile acids are known to produce both beneficial and harmful effects. cAMP-mediated protection against bile acid-induced apoptosis is PKA independent. the agonist 007 protects rat hepatocytes against bile acid-, Fas ligand-, and TNF-induced apoptosis. glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is responsible for EPAC-mediated protection of hepatocyte from bile acid-induced apoptosis. polarization of hepatocytes, the primary epithelial cells present in the liver, is important for separating apical and basolateral membrane domains and forming the bile canaliculus (293). taurocholate exerts its polarity-stimulating effect by increasing cellular cAMP and signals through EPAC/Rap1/MEK/LKB1/AMPK. asis activity has been demonstrated by cAMP acting downstream of glucagon or epinephrine. glucagon inhibits internalization and promotes reinsertion of ABC transporters to the canalicular pole of membrane in estrogen-induced cholestasis. salbutamol\u2019s effect is EPAC/MEK dependent and PKA independent. in rat hepatocytes, glucagon activates a PLC-dependent inwardly rectifying Ca2+ current and an AC-dependent outwardly rectifying Cl- current. glucagon and cAMP suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and activity in hepatocytes through a PKA-independent mechanism that involves JNK (1187). EPAC activation and SOCS3 expression inhibit glucagon/cAMP-dependent PKA activation, CREB phosphorylation and gluconeogenic gene expression. glucagon/cAMP increases hepatic FGF21 production at posttranscriptional levels via a cooperative mechanism. bile acids are derivatives of cholesterols. cAMP-mediated protection against bile acid-induced apoptosis is PKA independent. the agonist 007 protects rat hepatocytes against bile acid-, Fas ligand-, and TNF-induced apoptosis by activation of Akt. glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is responsible for EPAC-mediated protection of hepatocytes from bile acid-induced apop methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis (741) polarization of hepatocytes, the primary epithelial cells present in the liver, is important for separating apical and basolateral membrane domains. taurocholate exerts its polarity-stimulating effect by increasing cellular cAMP. cAMP acting downstream of glucagon or epinephrine inhibits internalization and promotes the reinsertion of ABC transporters to the canalicular pole of membrane in estrogen-induced cholestasis. glucagon and a 2 adrenergic agonist, salbutamol, increase intracellular cAMP where the ligands partially and additively reverse estradiol 17-d-glucuronide (E17G)-induced impairment of a study by Murthy and colleagues (850) shows that TGR5 is present in gastric muscle cells. treatment with the ligand oleanolic acid (OA) activated Gs and increased cAMP levels. OA treatment does not cause gastric muscle cell contraction, but rather inhibits sustained cell contraction induced by carbachol. the use of a nonhydrolyzable dipeptide, glycylsarcosine, allowed Coon et al. to further demonstrate that GIP activates PepT1 enhancing glycylsarcosine uptake in CDX2-transfected IEC-6 cells. activation of EPAC by 007 mimics GIP stimulation, dose-dependently enhances glycylsarcosine uptake, and increases the an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in response to muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulation is the principal stimulus for acinar cell secretion (1120) cAMP synergizes with Ca2+ and potentiates digestive enzyme secretion and zymogen activation (161) in isolated pancreatic acinar cells, physiological concentrations of carbachol (1 M) lead to maximal amylase secretion and minimal to no zymogen activation. secretagogues that activate second messengers DAG/IP3 or cAMP all induce robust Rap1 activation, which is required for stimulated amylase secretion. supporting this principle function of Rap1 by ectopically overexpressing Rap1GAP antagonizes both the action of cAMP and ca2+/DAG-stimulated amylase release in pancreatic acinar cells. expression of EPAC1 protein in mouse proximal tubules was demonstrated using an EPAC1-specific antibody (431). expression of EPAC1 protein in S1, S2 and S3 segments of mouse proximal tubules was demonstrated using an EPAC1-specific antibody (431). expression of EPAC1 in the convoluted tubule/connecting tubule was identified by positive staining of the Calbindin-D28k (Calb28k) EPAC1 was evenly distributed in intercalated cells of the cortex and outer medulla. mainly in AQP2-positive cells of the inner medulla. a strong, dispersed vesicular-like expression pattern for EPAC2 was observed. calcitonin-induced stimulation of H+-K+-ATPase in -intercalated cells of rat is mediated by EPAC1 (584) in the kidney, H+-K+-ATPases are localized to the CD and play important roles in K+ reabsorption, proton secretion, and acid-base balance (1214) the activity of this specific antiporter is tightly regulated by second messengers generated by a number of hormones (717) selective PKA or EPAC cAMP analogs were used to stimulate opossum kidney cells and murine kidney slices. inhibition of NHE3 by PKA activation is accompanied by increased NHE3 phosphorylation. studies based on pig kidney epithelial cell lines suggest that GLP-1 most likely modulates sodium homeostasis in the kidney by suppressing NHE3 activity. ANG II treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in Rap1A activation and a concomitant increase in membrane translocation of NHE3. a family of NHE3-binding proteins, acting as cofactors, is required for cAMP-mediated NHE3 inhibition (251) studies using primary BBM isolated from the kidney cortex of NHERF1/ mice have shown that NHERF1 is required for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (1109). an extended analysis of NHERF1 in various segments of the intestine reveals that although NHERF1 has segment-specific effects on intestinal salt absorption, unlike NHERF3, NHERF1 is not required for NHE3 regulation by cAMP in intestine. the UT-A1 is expressed in the terminal IMCD and is the major and most important UT in kidney among six known UT-A transcriptional variants derived from alternative promoters. phosphorylation sites on UT-A1 have been mapped to S486, S499, and S84 (56, 89, 455) however, the phosphorylation sites regulated by EPAC appear to be different and are not currently mapped. a phosphorylation incompetent mutation S494A decreased UT-A1 abundance in the membrane. duction of this receptor initiates the transcription, translocation, and fusion of AQP2-containing intracellular vesicles to the apical plasma membrane. water is reabsorbed by AQP2 from the urine into the cell and then transported across the basolateral membrane by AQP3 and AQP4 (765) the effect of AVP on AQP2 was originally proposed to be mediated by PKA through direct phosphorylation at residue Ser256. calmodulin kinase II promotes a sustained transcriptional activation of AQP2 expression (402, 1024) in a cAMP/CREB-dependent manner (443, 665, 1161) dDAVP administration upregulated expression of EPAC1 and 2. cAMP levels remained significantly higher than basal concentrations. dDAVP-induced AQP2 transcription was downregulated in mpkCCD cells. inhibition of PKA after 3 days of dDAVP stimulation did not suppress AQP2 transcription. however, incubation with a specific EPAC agonist 3 days after dDAVP pretreatment increased both AQP2 transcription and abundance compared with sole dDAVP treatment. ANG II acts on the ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R) to activate ROMK channels in CCDs isolated from high potassium fed rats via a NO/cGMP pathway involving cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling in an EPAC-independent manner (1105). the cAMP-mediated signaling system is very complex and our ability to dissect the respective contributions of EPAC and PKA in a spatial and temporal manners is very limited. potassium from basolateral to apical surfaces provide electrochemical potential for fluid secretion, or for stimulated fluid secretion in stellate cells that control water and anions conductance (265). bPAC properly targeted to intracellular microdomains or further extension of similar approaches into higher organisms could significantly advance our understanding of cAMP signaling. staining of rat renal sections for EPAC1 or 2 with individual nephron segment marker proteins showed positive staining mainly at the BBM, but also in the cytosol and at the basolateral side of these cells. the expression of EPAC1 in the convoluted tubule/connecting tubule was weaker than that of the PT. a strong, dispersed vesicular-like expression pattern for EPAC2 was observed in all AQP1-positive TAL cells. apical and basolateral EPAC2 staining was clearly visible in all AQP2-positive cells. similar EPAC1 and 2 expression patterns were observed in the human kidney. the activity and membrane trafficking of H+-K+-ATPases are known to be regulated by signals that generate second messengers such as cAMP, Ca2+, and DAG. calcitonin and isoproterenol treatment led to a cAMP-dependent activation of the H+-K+-ATPase in microdissected rat CCD. agents known to increase intracellular cAMP concentration in renal and intestinal epithelia suppress NHE3 activity and decrease sodium absorption. selective PKA or EPAC cAMP analogs were used to stimulate opossum kidney cells and murine kidney slices. inhibition of NHE3 by PKA activation accompanied by increased NHE3 phosphorylation. ANG II is known to promote bicarbonate absorption in PCT by reducing intracellular cAMP via a Gi-mediated signaling cascade (623) in LLC-PK1 cells, ANG II treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in Rap1A activation and a concomitant increase in membrane translocation of NHE3. a family of NHE3-binding proteins, acting as cofactors, is required for. the multi-PDZ domain containing NHERF1 binds NHE3 and transduces the cAMP-mediated NHE3-inhibitory effect (1108\u20131110, 1177) studies using primary BBM isolated from the kidney cortex of NHERF1/ mice have shown that NHERF1 is required for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (1109). the UT-A1 is expressed in the terminal IMCD and is the major and most important UT in kidney among six known UT-A transcriptional variants derived from alternative promoters or splicing. urea flux stimulated by vasopressin and forskolin was only partially blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKA. phosphorylation of S494 by PKC did not directly promote UT-A1 trafficking. phosphorylation incompetent mutation S494A decreased UT-A1 abundance in the membrane. at least seven aquaporin channels are known to be expressed in human kidney. treatment with PKA inhibitors failed to block AVP-induced Ca2+ mobilization and [Ca2+]i oscillations in perfused IMCD. cAMP agonist 007 indeed mimicked AVP in triggering ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ mobilization and [Ca2+]i oscillations, triggered apical exocytosis, and induced apical translocation of AQP2 in perfused IMCD dDAVP upregulated the expression of EPAC1 while downregulating EPAC2 in mpkCCD cells. inhibition of ERK blocked CREB phosphorylation and attenuated upregulation of AQP2 by AVP. pretreatment increased both AQP2 transcription and abundance compared with sole dDAVP treatment. the PKA/CREB pathway is partially responsible for the AVP-mediated acute expression of AQP2, but not for the sustained AQP2 expression, which may involve the activation of EPAC (552). cAMP stimulates apical exocytic insertion of the renal Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb is highly dependent the cAMP-mediated signaling system is very complex. most knowledge regarding EPAC/PKA-mediated signaling and function are based on in vitro analyses in cell cultures. the use of conventional genetic or pharmacological approaches is still quite challenging. cAMP signaling has been implicated in signaling pathways responsible for the mitogenic and contractile state of the tissue. cAMP signaling could be fundamental in formulating next generation therapies for pathologies such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. anti-proliferative signaling by PGE2-induced elevation of cAMP may suggest a regulatory mechanism for cell proliferation agents that increase cAMP. induction of relaxation and attenuation of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation would be effective at treating both short- and long-term symptoms of proliferative airway pathologies. two PKA-selective agonists were unable to effectively reduce proliferation by EGF stimulation. selective PKA-independent EPAC activation imitated the 2-AR agonist anti-proliferative effect. similar conclusions were obtained in lung fibroblasts where inhibition of cAMP signaling was attenuated. loss of PKA function greatly potentiated ERK1/2 activity and proliferation in airway smooth muscle cells treated with PGE2. this may suggest an unknown modulatory role for PKA specifically in PGE2 anti-mitogenic signaling. however, the inhibitory effect of 2-AR agonists and PGE2 requires input from the PKA arm of cAMP signaling. activation of either PKA or EPAC protected the expression of -SMA and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain which are typically decreased in presence of PDGF (881, 884). this suggests that EPAC and PKA are important in maintenance of the normal contractile phenotype of airway smooth muscle in pro-mitogenic environments. airway relaxation Inopportune bronchoconstriction is associated with COPD and asthma. regulation of airway smooth muscle in these airway diseases can be linked to improper regulation on molecular level. an earlier report suggested relaxation induced by -AR stimulation of guinea pig trachea occur through an unknown, PKA-independent effect (972) cAMP pathways in airway smooth muscle cells revealed that selective activation of EPAC, independent of PKA signaling, successfully relaxed methacholine-treated guinea pig and human tracheal tissue (883) cAMP modulation of the balance between RhoA and Rac1 activity has demonstrated activation of EPAC modulates activation of EPAC was found to specifically attenuate the two- to threefold increase in MLC phosphorylation induced my methacholine (883), presumably by Rac1-dependent inhibition of MLC kinase. the unaffected basal phosphorylation suggests a regulatory role for EPAC in the dynamic signaling of airway smooth muscle contraction (883) agonist activation leads to significant relaxation in guinea pig tracheal rings. endogenous dopamine promotes relaxation without changes to cAMP. cAMP production is masked by concomitant activation of the Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptor. paracrine and endocrine inputs In airway epithelium, GABA release augments -AR relaxant effects. treatment of these airway epithelial cells with forskolin replicated the 2-AR agonist suppression, while EPAC activation was without effect. antimitogenic and airway relaxant roles of EPAC present a unique opportunity to target this specific downstream effector exhibiting two beneficial responses. a more precise strategy to alleviate acute bronchoconstriction and prevent pulmonary tissue remodeling could significantly improve quality of life for asthmatic and COPD patients. anti-proliferative signaling by PGE2-induced elevation of cAMP may suggest a regulatory mechanism for cell proliferation agents that increase cAMP. induction of relaxation and attenuation of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation would be effective at treating both short- and long-term symptoms of proliferative airway pathologies. agonists were unable to effectively reduce proliferation by EGF stimulation. selective PKA-independent EPAC activation imitated the 2-AR agonist anti-proliferative effect. ectopic expression of the constitutively active C subunit of PKA also unable to inhibit proliferation in these cells. loss of PKA function greatly potentiated the ERK1/2 activity and proliferation in airway smooth muscle cells treated with PGE2. this may suggest an unknown modulatory role for PKA specifically in PGE2 anti-mitogenic signaling. however, the inhibitory effect of 2-AR agonists and PGE2 requires input from the PKA arm of cAMP signaling. activation of either PKA or EPAC protected the expression of -SMA and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain which are typically decreased in presence of PDGF (881, 884). this suggests that EPAC and PKA are important in maintaining the normal contractile phenotype of airway smooth muscle in pro-mitogenic environments. airway relaxation Inopportune bronchoconstriction is associated with COPD and asthma. regulation of airway smooth muscle in these airway diseases can be linked to improper regulation on molecular level. an earlier report suggested relaxation induced by -AR stimulation of guinea pig trachea occur through an unknown, PKA-independent effect (972) cAMP pathways in airway smooth muscle cells revealed that selective activation of EPAC, independent of PKA signaling, successfully relaxed methacholine-treated guinea pig and human tracheal tissue (883) unaffected basal phosphorylation suggests a regulatory role for EPAC in the dynamic signaling of airway smooth muscle contraction (883) the modulation of Ca2+-dependent or ATP-sensitive channels by EPAC activation could also contribute to the relaxation observed in this signaling pathway. guinea pig tracheal rings treated with acetylcholine induce contraction. endogenous dopamine promotes relaxation without changes to cAMP. cAMP production is masked by concomitant activation of the Gi-coupled dopamine. in airway epithelium, GABA release augments -AR relaxant effects (329, 330) terbutaline reduced methacholine-induced GABA release, and expression of PKI rescued this secretion. treatment of these airway epithelial cells with forskolin replicated the 2-AR agonist suppression. the role of estrogen on the modulation of airway constriction/relaxation by altering cAMP signaling components. a more precise strategy to alleviate acute bronchoconstriction and prevent pulmonary tissue remodeling could significantly improve quality of life for asthmatic and COPD patients. the cytoplasm must then reduce the levels of Ca2+ to invoke the maximum response with the subsequent potential. this occurs through reloading of the SR via the Ca2+-ATPase SERCA by removing the inhibitory PLN, and by efflux of Ca2+ out of the cell through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. however, many regulatory pathways act on modulatory proteins involved in the release and sequestration of Ca2+. activation of EPAC or upstream -adrenergic signaling increased membrane localized PKC-. inhibition of PKC- abolished EPAC-induced CaMKII activation. increased sequestration and release can lead to larger Ca2+ transients. increased intracellular Ca2+ could also occur through alteration of L-type VDCC currents. changes in intracellular Ca2+ influx are consistently found to be blocked by the CaMKII inhibitor (KN93) and RyR2 Ser2815 phosphorylation was again greater after EPAC activation explaining the increased Ca2+ leak and decreased Ca2+ transient (820). this suggests the global activation of -AR acting on EPAC induces increased Ca2+ transients through paired increases in both SR Ca2+ load and leak. the absence of EPAC1 caused observable decreases in basal and peak Ca2+ transients, attributed to a reduction in SR stored Ca2+. PLN ser16, a previously identified PKA site, was also found to be decreased in EPAC1-null animals. increased incidence of Ca2+ sparks observed after EPAC activation in previous studies was attributed as an EPAC2 function in accordance with the loss of this effect only in EPAC2-knockout mice (819). both isoforms of EPAC are involved in Ca2+ handling of myocytes in the intact animal, although the exact contribution of each isoform is still being explored. EPAC was not found to alter the maximum amplitude of the Ca2+ current induced by these channels. the added inflow of Ca2+ at lower potentials could further elevate the SR load in these cells. the effects of EPAC were completely abolished when transcriptional activity was inhibited. cAMP acts as a relaxant for vascular smooth muscles through inhibition of the contractile forces generated by RhoA. in support of these actions by EPAC, the antagonistic modulation of RhoA activity by EPAC activation is lost in Rap1B-null animals (1213) EPAC1 knockout mice found to be attenuated including left ventricular ejection fraction. treatment with isoproterenol effectively reversed these effects. phenotypes attributed to decreased phosphorylation of RyR2 and PLN. KA and EPAC activation suggests cooperative roles for the cAMP sensors (850) a more confined role for EPAC was identified in prostate, smooth muscle where tone is regulated by 1-AR mediated contraction and cAMP mediated relaxation. proliferation and muscle regeneration are linked to the function of calcitonin receptors to maintain quiescence. both EPAC and PKA activation were determined to suppress the emergence of muscle satellite cells from below the niche basal lamina (1144) this effect was also attributed to PKA activity alone (1144) nuclear export of ERK1/2 prevents phosphorylation of Elk1, a cofactor of SRE binding element, resulting in subsequent decrease in Egr1 (527). proliferation was again attenuated by EPAC in human coronary artery smooth muscle acting downstream of 2B-AR on NR4A1 in the presence of PDGF stimulation (668). suppressive role of EPAC signaling was also examined in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction of this process could induce neovascularization to promote self-healing of an injured heart after an infarction (68) epinephrine derivative selective for 2-AR effectively observes increases of muscle growth by 27\u201341% and decreases of muscle loss by 10\u201320%. signaling through 2-AR can lead to PI3K activation, subsequent Akt phosphorylation, and mTOR activation which is involved in muscle hypertrophy. effects were mediated by the prevention of complete Akt phosphorylation, inhibition of downstream S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, as well as decreased phosphorylation of CaMKII/HDAC4 (Ser246) known to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy (628, 780) Akt activation is not only associated with muscle hypertrophy, but also in suppressing muscle atrophy. epinephrine can also potentiate the phosphorylation of Akt and Foxo3a. this effect is observed at concentrations correlated to those found to inhibit proteolytic actions in muscle (760) previous studies also demonstrated the cooperative nature of insulin and epinephrine signaling in acutely diabetic sympathectomized rats. inhibition with H89 illustrates increased Akt activation after epinephrine stimuli in the presence of insulin, while decreasing glycogen phosphorylase activation as anticipated. this suggests a shift of cAMP balance readily available for EPAC activation and potentiation of downstream signaling in skeletal muscle. reestablishment of cAMP concentrations by inhibition of PI3K or EPAC reversed the effect of the PDE4 inhibitor. this suggests that EPAC is required for the anabolic effect in these animals after serious injury. calcium handling Stressful conditions or exercise invoke increased contraction of cardiac muscles to increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to exhausted tissues. proper signaling of this system requires rapid induction and quick reboot for subsequent contractions. stimulation of -AR induces cAMP and activates downstream effectors PKA and EPAC to initiate CICR. loss of PLC- expression or inhibition attenuated the electrically induced Ca2+ transient amplitude in response to 007 stimulation. reintroduction of PLC- rescued the increased Ca2+ induction. 007 activation of EPAC signaling reduced SR Ca2+ load correlating with decreased Ca2+ transients (778, 779, 819, 820) the level of Ca2+ sparks were measured to simulate spontaneous Ca2+ released from the SR by RyR activation. this alters the magnitude of Ca2+ released during electrical stimulation. each study agrees that EPAC activation leads to sensitization of RyR receptors through CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation. a leftward shift of intracellular Ca2+ required to generate tension by myofilaments. this suggests contrasting roles for PKA and EPAC in alteration of Ca2+ sensitivity. the phosphorylation of PLN at Thr17, a CaMKII site, was initially observed to be regulated by EPAC activation in vitro. but EPAC1-null heart homogenates did not portray altered phosphorylation of PLN Thr17. this may represent potential differences in the knockout efficiency of siRNA versus genomic knockout. activation of EPAC in vitro or in vivo by Sp-8pCPT, thus far, only promotes increased Ca2+ transients demonstrated with rapid caffeine application. decay of the Ca2+ transient was stunted suggesting that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is suppressed during EPAC activation. cAMP acts as a relaxant for vascular smooth muscles through inhibition of the contractile forces generated by RhoA. cAMP acts as a relaxant for vascular smooth muscles through inhibition of the contractile forces generated by RhoA. the antagonistic modulation of RhoA activity by EPAC activation is lost in Rap1B-null animals (1213) EPAC activation is involved in reduction of cytosolic Ca2+ by increasing BKCa channels activity (878) or slowly leaking cytosolic Ca2+ from the SR to reduce the SR load (208), consequently hyperpolarizing the membrane and attenuating contractile states. eNOS, along with PKA, in endothelial cells to produce NO and induce relaxation of nearby muscle (336, 878). drenergic stimulation of cAMP in a skeletal muscle cell line does not appear to induce PKA, PI3K, PKC, PKG, or EPAC-dependent signaling systems to inhibit contractility and detachment. drenergic stimulation of cAMP activates K+ channels for extracellular Ca2+ depletion-induced ROCK-dependent contractility. the relaxant action of cAMP, mainly PKA, in this system is observed to be limited to regulation of ROCK, while PKC induction of Ca2+ sensitization is independent of cAMP intervention (405). this results may be reflective of a more modulatory role of EPAC, compared with PKA, in physiological conditions. a follow-up study further illustrated the synergistic effect of PKA and EPAC activation by highlighting the decrease in Egr1 expression, an important protein for VSMC proliferation. this effect of EPAC is Rap1-independent since loss of Rap1 did not alter the level of proliferation in these cells (417) collagen synthesis in rat cardiac fibroblasts (1071, 1171), thus EPAC may be responsible for the regulation of fibrotic scarring of the heart. a reduction in activity of cAMP sensors, like EPAC, is observed at reduced cAMP levels in response to elevated PDE1A (700) the suppressive action of cAMP on EMT and EPAC/Rap1 roles could again be targeted to decrease fibrosis. the balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis is known to be regulated by insulin and catecholamine signaling. epinephrine activity increased cAMP-induced EPAC activation. Akt phosphorylation was enhanced in the presence of insulin stimuli. support for this conclusion was further developed with the use of the EPAC agonist 007 to induce phosphorylation of Akt and Foxo3a. phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) activates both Akt phosphorylation sites. Akt then phosphorylates Foxo1/3a transcription factors to occlude translocation. this disrupts transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF-1. pentoxifylline, a nonselective PDE inhibitor, gave investigators some insight into the action of cAMP sensors. inhibition of PDEs lead to a decrease in activity of both ca2+-dependent and proteasome-dependent proteolytic processes. this suggests an alternative pathway which PKA can employ for inhibition of proteolysis. the phosphorylation of 2-AR, CREB, Akt, 4E-BP1 and Foxo3a was at the highest deviations from normal after a few days. this would suggest that with continual 2-AR activation other pro-anabolic pathways would need to be induced to sustain the positive effect. this may be caused by receptor desensitization or decreased receptor density observed on the 10th day in the study. the role of EPAC in the musculature has predominantly been uncovered through work in cardiovascular muscles groups. however, efforts to unveil the nature of these signaling pathways in other muscle groups continue to expand. cAMP-dependent EPAC and PKA are also reported to cooperatively suppress RhoA/ROCK-mediated contraction. erK and Runx2 also showed decreased phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory mechanism for EPAC (1010). a potential link in the mechanism for the inhibitory action of EPAC towards RhoA is PI3K activity concurrent with Rap1 activation. the bidirectional signal is attributed to a heterogeneous microenvironment within a diverse population of osteoblasts (133, 498, 581, 582) in this signaling cascade, activation of PTH receptor stimulates AC to produce cAMP which can signal to downstream cAMP sensors. ERK activation prevents cAMP-induced proliferation in bone cells. VIP stimulation mimicked by elevated intracellular cAMP activation of PKA leads to IL-6 expression through increased phosphorylation of CREB by PKA. the activity of PKA was also reported to play a partial role in inhibiting expression of osterix, an important osteoblast specific transcription factor, in an EPAC-independent manner (435). KA could be attributed to PKA countering MAPK activation through phosphorylation of Raf-1 and subsequent inactivation of Ras/Raf-1/MEK signaling. a dependency on the expression of two major splice variants of B-Raf, 95 kDa and 62 kDa, appear to be a key component to the duality of PTH signal propagation. a signaling pathway through EPAC/Rap1/B-Raf to induce bone growth. also illustrate the input of multiple regulatory brakes. PGs are also implicated in growth plate chondrocyte development and long bone growth through potentiation of IGF-I stimulation. cox-2-null and prostacyclin receptor-null mice grow normally, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism. the relevance of the PKA-independent PGI2/EPAC/Rap1/MEK pathway induction of bone growth remains to be resolved. adhesion of osteoblasts is clearly important in the development of bone regeneration technology. acceleration of osteoporosis is common following loss of ovarian function. cAMP lowers cAMP to enhance osteoclast differentiation and function. elevation of cAMP by PDE inhibition is observed to augment bone mass (512, 530, 807, 1143, 1198) forskolin imitated the effect of cilostazol and loss of PKA and EPAC1 effectively blocked impairment of osteoclasts both alone and in tandem. cilostazol\u2019s elevation of cAMP affected the transcriptional regulation of the osteoclast precursors. further support of cAMP inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is observed in a highly enriched (CD45R-CD3-CD115+) population of osteoclast progenitor cells. calcitonin was found to be effective at inhibiting osteoclast development only 24 h before completion of 96-h cultures. cAMP in osteoclastogenesis remains controversial with others observing a potential positive effect on osteoclast formation. selective EPAC activation enhanced osteoclast RANKL-induced differentiation by 13\u201320%. further RANKL stimulation demonstrated Rap1 activity dependent on the presence of EPAC1 and EPAC2 while in the absence of EPACs, morphometric measurements of toluidine blue-stain dentine pit areas are decreased. initial EPAC activation was found to downregulate gene expression of several pro-osteogenic genes including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen, and osteocalcin. a potential link in the mechanism for the inhibitory action of EPAC towards RhoA is PI3K activity concurrent with Rap1 activation. inhibition of PI3K or ARAP3 siRNA reversed the effects of EPAC in a manner similar to the expression of a RhoA activating mutation. ERK inhibition prevents cAMP-induced proliferation in bone cells. but loss of MAPK signaling also blocks IL-6 expression by 42% without altering osteocalcin expression. expression, loss of ERK signaling was unable to directly inhibit IL-6 expression. inhibition of PKA markedly reduced levels of IL-6 expression through CREB activity. inhibition of ERK and PKC mirroring this reduction to lesser extent. blocking PKA does not affect basal proliferation and only enhanced mitogenic action with increasing cAMP levels. a negative-feedback mechanism by PKA could be attributed to PKA countering MAPK activation through phosphorylation of Raf-1 and subsequent inactivation of Ras/Raf-1/MEK signaling. cAMP reversed the action of cAMP to inhibit mitogenic signaling with reduction of ERK activity. a group also commented on this effect where ERK activity is gradually decreased in maturing osteoblasts. a group also commented on this effect where ERK activity is gradually decreased in maturing osteoblasts. iloprost was blocked by AC inhibition, but mimicked by elevation of cAMP (453) the action of AC infers that PGI2 is signaling through the prostacyclin IP receptor present in osteoblasts. cAMP elevation completely restored the effects induced by celecoxib. inhibition of PKA reversed these effects (631) thus selective activation of PKA may prove effective in enhancing bone regenerative technology. osteoclastogenesis involves a highly regulated cascade of signaling systems to coordinate the processes of differentiation, fusion, and function. forskolin imitated the effect of cilostazol and loss of PKA and EPAC1 effectively blocked impairment of osteoclasts both alone and in tandem. cilostazol\u2019s elevation of cAMP affected the transcriptional regulation of the osteoclast precursors. cAMP inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is observed in a highly enriched (CD45R-CD3-CD115+) population of osteoclast progenitor cells. calcitonin was found to be effective at inhibiting osteoclast development only 24 h before completion of 96-h cultures, suggesting the effect occurs at a very late stage. downstream effectors (592, 1142) were not perturbed by calcitonin. elevation of cAMP with forskolin directly mimicked this inhibitory effect on osteoclasts. however, the role of cAMP in osteoclastogenesis remains controversial. innate immunity is accomplished by specialized cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, natural killers, and dendritic cells. signaling through cAMP is known to be important for many functions of these innate immune cells. cAMP is known to be important for many functions of these innate immune cells. neutrophils were reported to not express EPAC1 (634, 1030) but selective EPAC agonist induced activation of Rap1 in differentiated neutrophil-like cell lines and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes began to alter this concept. authors conclude that since inclusion of serine protease inhibitors was required for visualization of EPAC, EPAC may have been subject to degradation by granular proteases released from neutrophils during cellular disruption. fMLP and EPAC agonist induce a slight conformational bias for the high-affinity binding state of LFA-1 (CD11a subunit) in human cell lines, induction of EPAC was without effect on adhesion. surprisingly in human PMN, induction of EPAC was without effect on adhesion. the 2-agonist salbutamol and several glucocorticoids are observed to attenuate neutrophil phagocytosis (925) stimulation with 2-agonist impaired RhoA activity and phagocytic levels in neutrophils. the demand for nonantibiotic therapies to restore or boost the immune system against resistant bacteria will be highly coveted in the coming years. depicted are currently reported signaling cascades involving EPAC1 in complement-mediated and IgG-mediated phagocytosis as well as reactive oxygen species production. RIAM silencing also reduces EPAC/Rap1-dependent enhancement of complement-opsonized phagocytosis by 50%. coimmunoprecipitation demonstrates an EPAC/Rap1-dependent complex of talin, RIAM, and the 2 integrin. RIAM is involved in recruitment of talin for subsequent activation of 2 integrins. a recent study investigating neutrophil-derived microparticles sought to determine if cAMP affected the production or release of these microparticles. these studies depict the complex nature of cAMP signaling in neutrophils and demonstrate selective activation of cAMP sensors for varying effects. conclusions to date demonstrate discriminatory targeting of PKA and EPAC may modulate neutrophil responses in ways that are clinically advantageous. motaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst are reported to be regulated by cAMP/PKA signaling. monocyte maturation into macrophages induces threefold induction of EPAC1 expression (120), further corroborated in macrophage cell lines and alveolar macrophage preparations. understanding underlying signaling mechanisms is crucial to development of next line therapies. the role of cAMP and PKA on regulation remains controversial. some reports that IB degradation activates PKA to phosphorylate p65. others suggest that PKA modification of the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of p65 inhibits NFB activity. EPAC/Rap1 activation was observed to phosphorylate both p65 sites at Ser276 as well as ser536. mBAFF expression is reliant on PKA and EPAC activation (725) the verdict is still out on how this regulation phosphorylates NFB. 2-AR activation unexpectedly increases IL-1 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine production in murine and human macrophage cells. this is because in the absence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, 2-AR activation unexpectedly increases cytokine production in the macrophage. this signaling was attributed to EPAC activation as 007 mimicked the 2-AR induction. in macrophages, the transcriptional regulation of genes is differentially regulated in response to cAMP levels and environmental stimuli leading to cooperative or antagonistic EPAC and PKA pathways. however, this cAMP-mediated cytokine regulation in macrophages is dependent on PKA, not EPAC, in contrast to DCs where EPAC and PKA are both important mediators. peritoneal macrophages treated with PKA inhibitors showed inverse regulation of TNF- and IL-10. this further supports PKA as the dominant regulator of cytokines in macrophages. authors describe suppression of CCL3 to implicate EPAC. cytokines may be reserved for specific sets of chemokines that are not modulated by PKA. migration of macrophages to the site of inflammation through the vasculature and host tissue is extremely important to function of these inflammatory mediators. monocytes treated initially with LPS lose their chemotactic capacity. however, this polarized expression is attenuated with LPS treatment. this may seem counterintuitive as the cell is trying to reach the site of infection. signals in circulation will exhibit minimal LPS with greater quantities of chemokine not to impede chemotaxis. migration arrests while cell adhesion and spreading are initiated. EPAC/Rap1 signaling may function to increase the effectiveness of this process throughout the cell periphery. inhibition of PKA further augmented the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473. this suggests PKA may inhibit this activity (710). this could depict a functional role for EPAC1 in targeting Akt. activation of Akt is observed to propagate pro-survival signals by elevating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels to inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage. cAMP-mediated induction of CREB upregulates Bcl-2 expression (710) through CRE-binding elements in the Bcl-2 promoter (1122) cAMP signaling skews macrophages to an M2 phenotype, which is exaggerated in the absence of miR-21. cAMP signaling skews macrophages to an M2 phenotype, which is exaggerated in the absence of miR-21. macrophages are professional phagocytizing cells, clearing cellular debris from sites of inflammation and infection as well as physiological maintenance throughout the body. the presence of this cAMP effector may be important to macrophage phagocytic pathways. profilin-1 and -2 were previously linked to RhoA and Rap1 signaling. both RhoA and EPAC pathways require downstream profilin activation. activation of neither small GTPase could rescue abolished phagocytosis. RIAM expression is upregulated during differentiation of macrophages. cross-talk between Rap1 signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present. in endogenous systems, cross-talk between Rap1 \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present. however, such feed-forward mechanisms in macrophages are not yet described. activation of either EPAC or PKA could recapitulate suppression of phagocytosis implicating both cAMP sensors. however, variable roles of PKA between macrophage subtypes or species could be another contributing factor. altered Rap1 expression does not affect FcR-mediated phagocytosis (147) phagocytosis requires activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in alveolar macrophages. PGE2 also inhibits activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in a PTEN-dependent manner. this suggests that PTEN may be involved in suppressive function of PGE2/EPAC on IgG-induced phagocytosis. edema toxin exhibits a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AC activity to induce a massive influx of cAMP after 6\u201324 h and disrupt the physiological homeostasis in the cell. implication of EPAC and PKA in toxin signaling mechanisms is revealed by maximal activation of either cAMP effector, to transduce the effect of anthrax AC. the effect of EPAC inhibitors in animal models exhibiting suppressed macrophage functions could be interesting to investigate and restore partial macrophage functions. the effect of EPAC inhibitors in animal models could be interesting to investigate and potentially restore partial macrophage functions. reduced bacterial killing of these alveolar macrophages may only be related to production of H2O2. additional mechanisms involving EPAC or PKA regulation of bactericidal activity remain to be explored. Rap1 has been observed to activate Rac1 through Rac1-specific GEFs. in this signaling system, the sole knockdown of Vav2 by siRNA effectively reduced Rac1 activation by EPAC/Rap1 suggesting Vav2 as the major Rac1 GEF in this process (609) studies relating to the role of EPAC in macrophages have begun to grow. the extensive nature of this signaling molecule in macrophages has begun to be appreciated as studies pertaining to this topic continue to grow. treatments in cancer biology may benefit from applying the findings to tumor-associated macrophages. overactivation of DCs is detrimental to the host and upsets the balance in the opposing direction leading to uncontrolled inflammation and autoimmunity. maturation/transcriptional regulation can assist in priming of the immune system or alternatively inducing tolerance. cAMP stimulating ligands potentiate the maturation of DCs. activation of PKA enhances intrinsic DC migratory capacity observed as increased chemotaxis towards CXCL12, concomitant to increased CXCR4 surface expression, but also augments random migration and chemokinesis. surprisingly random migration and chemokinesis are unaffected by the action of EPAC. this action of Rap1 suggests that Treg generated adenosine can induce cytoskeletal reorganization in DCs to promote directed motility. this function may be relevant during minor injuries or cell death where levels of purines are elevated. but Treg cell conversion of ATP to adenosine can attract and circumvent unnecessary DC-mediated immunological responses. the use of cAMP analogs selective for EPAC and PKA signify regulatory actions of EPAC on PKA signaling are independent of cAMP competition between the two sensors. the role of PKA activity in this process is attenuation of TNF-, TGF-, IL-18, and IL-10 mRNA transcription. cotreatment with EPAC agonist selectively reversed only expression of IL-10 and IL-18 partially. expression through EP2 receptor activation of EPAC in a PKA-independent mechanism. EPAC subsequently activates Akt to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3. CDP repressor binding to promoters then attenuates transcription (478, 479) EP1 and EP3 receptor agonists are without effect. cAMP production was not detected with EP4 activation, but only after EP2 agonist stimulation. cAMP production was not detected with EP4 activation, but only after EP2 agonist stimulation. cAMP activation increases cAMP to inhibitory levels, shutting down IL-23 production and release, thereby inducing an anti-inflammatory signal. cAMP is one of a plethora of signals being integrated by DCs during the maturation process. selective activation of EPAC could lead to tolerance induction and attenuate allergic and autoimmune disorders. neutrophils were reported to not express EPAC1 (634, 1030) but selective EPAC agonist induced activation of Rap1 in differentiated neutrophil-like cell lines and human polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes began to alter this concept (223) this observation was ultimately supported by visual mRNA and protein levels of EPAC1 in human PMN cells. fMLP and EPAC agonist induce conformational bias for high-affinity binding state of LFA-1. adhesion of in vitro cell model of PMN cells was activated by EPAC stimulation. phagocytosis is one of the fundamental roles for neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the innate immune response. 2-agonist salbutamol and several glucocorticoids are observed to attenuate neutrophil phagocytosis (925) stimulation with 2-agonist impaired RhoA activity and phagocytic levels in neutrophils. RIAM is integral to complement-mediated phagocytosis process in HL60 cells. inflammatory stimulation continues to activate Rap1 in RIAM knockdown HL60 cells. inflammatory stimulation continues to activate Rap1 in RIAM knockdown HL60 cells. coimmunoprecipitation demonstrates an EPAC/Rap1-dependent complex of talin, RIAM, and the 2 integrin. the complex formation and recruitment is lost with RIAM silencing. RIAM is crucial for \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling of Rap1 and is involved in recruitment of talin for subsequent activation of 2 integrins. the cAMP analog and PKA activator decreased the level of microparticles in an EPAC-independent manner (697) together, these studies depict the complex nature of cAMP signaling in neutrophils. conclusions to date demonstrate discriminatory targeting of PKA and EPAC may modulate neutrophil responses in ways that are clinically advantageous. fMLP and EPAC agonist induce conformational bias for the high-affinity binding state of LFA-1. adhesion of in vitro cell model of PMN cells was activated by EPAC stimulation. this could suggest that although Rap1 is active in human neutrophils, translocation of Rap1 requires further signals that are either basally, or exogenously, activated in the leukemic cell line. the 2-agonist salbutamol and several glucocorticoids are observed to attenuate neutrophil phagocytosis (925) stimulation with 2-agonist impaired RhoA activity and phagocytic levels in neutrophils. RIAM is integral to complement-mediated phagocytosis process in HL60 cells. inflammatory stimulation continues to activate Rap1 in RIAM knockdown HL60 cells. inflammatory stimulation continues to activate Rap1 in RIAM knockdown HL60 cells. complex formation and recruitment is lost with RIAM silencing, suggesting that RIAM is crucial for \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling of Rap1. RIAM activation of Rap1 is implicated in phagocytic signaling that could be a relevant target for enhancement of the innate immune system in neutrophils. cAMP analog and PKA activator decreased the level of microparticles in an EPAC-independent manner (697) these studies depict the complex nature of cAMP signaling in neutrophils and demonstrate selective activation of cAMP sensors for varying effects. conclusions to date demonstrate discriminatory targeting of PKA and EPAC may modulate neutrophil responses in ways that are clinically advantageous. s induces threefold induction of EPAC1 expression (120), further corroborated in macrophage cell lines and alveolar macrophage preparations. understanding underlying signaling mechanisms is crucial to development of next line therapies. transcriptional regulation requires transcriptional modification often induced by an ever-changing cytokine milieu. activates PKA to phosphorylate p65 to increase binding sites for co-activators CBP/p300 and enhance transcriptional regulation. initial approaches defined that LPS induced cAMP and Rap1 activity to a similar extent as direct stimulation of EPAC. the stimulation of PKA of EPAC effectively upregulates the promoter activity, transcription, and translation of mBAFF. p65 ser536 activation appears to involve the combined action of PKA to phosphorylate p65 Ser276 and ROS/EPAC/Rap1 to phosphorylate p65 Ser276 and Ser536 (723) the verdict is still out on how this regulation of EPAC/Rap1 phosphorylates NFB, what additional modulators like IB or potential kinases may be involved. 007 treatment mimicked 2-AR induction, with 30-fold induction of IL-1 and 3-fold induction of IL-6. ERK1/2- and p38-mediated phosphorylation of activating transcription factor (ATF) 1 and 2 (1008) activity of other transcriptional regulators on IL-1 and IL-6 expression including C/EBP and CREB were largely unaffected by 2-AR stimulation. transcriptional regulation of genes is differentially regulated in response to cAMP levels and environmental stimuli leading to cooperative or antagonistic EPAC and PKA pathways. in macrophages, the transcriptional regulation of genes is differentially regulated in response to cAMP levels and environmental stimuli leading to cooperative or antagonistic EPAC pathways. peritoneal macrophages treated with PKA inhibitors demonstrated inverse regulation of TNF- and IL-10 as observed with cAMP/PKA activation and PGE2 treatment. this further supports PKA as the dominant regulator of cytokines in macrophages. an independent study did explore a possible regulatory role for EPAC1 in chemokine production. migration of macrophages to the site of inflammation is extremely important to function of these inflammatory mediators. monocytes respond by rolling along the vascular endothelia through integrin CD11b/ICAM interactions. CD11b\u2019s role shifts to locate C3b complement-opsonized particles. monocytes treated initially with LPS lose their chemotactic capacity. chemokines, Rap1 and p38 are found to localize to the leading edge of the monocyte to presumably continually activate integrins. this may seem counterintuitive as cell is trying to reach the site of infection. serotonin, which stimulates cAMP induction, mimics the enhanced adhesion and chemotaxis of EPAC activation independent of PKA in monocytes. the reason behind the apparent lack of regulation of EPAC on 2 integrin activation in this study remains unclear. inhibition of PKA or knockdown of CREB by 60\u201370% effectively attenuates the mitogenic effect of forskolin, but PKA-dependent signaling is unable to account for the enhanced rapid induction of PI3K by forskolin was retained for several minutes matching the kinetics of pAkt Ser473 during this stimulation, unlike pAkt Thr308. PI3K inhibition only accounting for 50% of Thr308 inhibition, suggesting involvement of a secondary kinase for this regulation and thus full activation of Akt. activation of Akt is observed to propagate pro-survival signals by elevating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels to inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage. cAMP-mediated induction of CREB upregulates Bcl-2 expression (710) through CRE-binding elements in the Bcl-2 promoter (1122) the most associated phenotype is M1 macrophages, which are responsible for acute inflammation, including recruitment of neutrophils and employment of phagocytosis. the most associated phenotype is M2 macrophages, which are observed during the end of inflammation or during chronic inflammatory environments to attempt to subvert the inflammatory state. macrophages undergoing complement-mediated phagocytosis, zymosan particle uptake is enhanced by EPAC/Rap1 activation (521, 684) in macrophages undergoing complement-mediated phagocytosis, serum-opsonized zymosan particle uptake is enhanced by EPAC activation (521, 684) EPAC/Rap1 phagocytosis does not utilize known RhoA downstream kinases, ROCK and LIMK (LIM domain kinase) to phosphorylate cofilin and form filaments. RIAM expression is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. cross-talk between Rap1 \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present, but such feed-forward mechanisms in macrophages are not yet described. the role of EPAC is completely inverted following the historically reported inhibition of phagocytosis by cAMP induction. altered Rap1 expression does not affect FcR-mediated phagocytosis (147) further support for Rap1-independent suppression of phagocytosis is observed with the localization of EPAC1 and Rap1 in the presence of PGE2 during phagocytosis. PGE2 inhibits activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in alveolar macrophages in a PTEN-dependent manner. blocking PTEN rescues phagocytosis and bacterial killing from PGE2/EPAC-dependent suppression. tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN is inversely correlated with enhanced PTEN lipid phosphatase activity. dema toxin exhibits a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AC activity to induce a massive influx of cAMP after 6\u201324 h and disrupt the physiological homeostasis in the cell. edema toxin reduced ingestion of E. coli to similar degree as another toxin, cytochalasin B, that disrupts actin filaments. Edema toxin treatment also supports the action of EPAC and PKA in attenuating phagocytosis. effect of EPAC inhibitors in animal models exhibiting suppressed macrophage functions could be interesting to investigate and restore partial macrophage functions. phagocytosis in mouse macrophage cells induces superoxide production to generate an oxidative burst. gene deletion of RhoA or Rap1 attenuates superoxide production 40%. oxidative process is directed by additive actions of RhoA and Rap1 in the activation and translocation of Rac1. RhoGDI precipitation of Rac1 appears inversely related to IgG-induced phagocytosis and RhoA-RhoGDI complex formation. this suggests a supplemental role for EPAC activation of Rap1 in activating ARAP3 to reduce active RhoA and promote RhoA-RhoGDI association. treatments in cancer biology may benefit from applying findings to tumor-associated macrophages to enhance re-education to M1 phenotypes and FcR-mediated phagocytosis by EPAC inhibition. a) transcriptional regulation. immune function and differentiation of specific immune cells requires transcriptional modification often induced by an ever-changing cytokine milieu. phosphorylation of IB is lessened or more is produced de novo. IB degradation activates PKA to phosphorylate p65 to increase binding sites for co-activators CBP/p300. some suggest that PKA modification of the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of p65 inhibits NFB activity. ation of TLR4 receptors also initiates ROS production. mBAFF expression is reliant on PKA and EPAC activation. mBAFF expression is reliant on PKA and EPAC activation. a study by Tan et al. (1008) suggests that the inhibitory signal by 2-AR may be relative to the overall environmental signaling around the macrophage. this is because in the absence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, 2-AR activation unexpectedly increases IL-1 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine production in murine and human macrophage cells. pro-inflammatory signaling dominates under conditions where extracellular environment is immunologically unchallenged. the latter scenario involves active EPAC to stimulate the transcriptional machinery and MAPK-mediated activation of ATF1 and ATF2. IL-1 and IL-6 suggesting a distinctive, potentially antagonistic inhibition of EPAC signaling by PKA. peritoneal macrophages treated with PKA inhibitors demonstrated inverse regulation of TNF- and IL-10 as observed with cAMP/PKA activation and PGE2 treatment. authors describe suppression of CCL3 to implicate EPAC, but the use of a more specific inhibitor to validate this conclusion is warranted. transcriptional regulation of cytokines appears specifically dominated by PKA signaling. any EPAC regulatory activity may be reserved for specific sets of chemokines that are not modulated by PKA. migration of macrophages to the site of inflammation through the vasculature and host tissue is extremely important to function of these inflammatory mediators. independent investigation also reported that VIP induction of EPAC/Rap1 signals through PI3K/Akt and ERK to enhance CD11b surface expression in monocytes (269). chemotaxis is modulated by EPAC/Rap1 activation of ARAP3 and subsequent inactivation of RhoA (728). initial signals in circulation will exhibit minimal LPS with greater quantities of chemokine not to impede chemotaxis. as the cell approaches the main site where levels of LPS are persistent and at their highest levels, migration arrests while cell adhesion and spreading are initiated. cAMP increases activation of Akt to promote proliferation through PKA and EPAC. inhibition of forskolin further augmented the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473. it has been previously shown that PI3K activation of Rap1 can cross-talk with PI3K/Akt signals in PKA-independent manners. activation of Akt is observed to propagate pro-survival signals by elevating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels to inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage. cAMP-mediated induction of CREB upregulates Bcl-2 expression (710) through CRE-binding elements in the Bcl-2 promoter (1122) the most associated phenotype is M1 macrophages, which are responsible for acute inflammation, including recruitment of neutrophils and employment of phagocytosis to clear foreign pathogens. one study identified miR-21 to be implicated in suppression of M2 differentiation of macrophages. macrophages are professional phagocytizing cells, clearing cellular debris from sites of inflammation and infection. similar mechanisms between these cell types may be conserved, while others are altered. the presence of this cAMP effector may be important to phagocytic pathways. the stabilization of actin can be affected by profilin-1 and -2 which were previously linked to RhoA and Rap1 signaling (92, 214, 573) and observed to co-immunoprecipitate with both Rap1 and RhoA (521). RIAM expression is upregulated during differentiation of macrophages. cross-talk between Rap1 signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present. in endogenous systems, cross-talk between Rap1 \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling and increased RhoA activation in \u201coutside-in\u201d signaling may also be present. redundancy between such signaling systems or natural divergence for specialized use of RhoA versus EPAC in this context remains to be explored. activation of either EPAC or PKA could recapitulate the PGE2-mediated suppression of phagocytosis implicating both cAMP sensors. however, variable roles of PKA between macrophage subtypes or species could be another contributing factor. phagocytosis requires activation of Akt and ERK1/2. PGE2 also inhibits activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in alveolar macrophages. this suggests that PTEN may be involved in suppressive function of PGE2/EPAC on IgG-induced phagocytosis. edema toxin produces an edema toxin that exhibits a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AC activity to induce a massive influx of cAMP after 6\u201324 h and disrupt the physiological homeostasis in the cell. implication of EPAC and PKA in toxin signaling mechanisms is revealed by maximal activation of either cAMP effector, to transduce the effect of anthrax AC. ocytosis by macrophages is currently perceivable. one involving EPAC activation of Rap1 to enhance \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling of integrins. another involving EPAC activation of Rap1 to enhance \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling of integrins. Rap1 N17 would be of interest to determine if small populations of active Rap1-GTP are transiently associating with the phagosome. reduced bacterial killing of these alveolar macrophages may only be related to the production of H2O2. additional mechanisms involving EPAC or PKA regulation of bactericidal activity remain to be explored. the mechanism of Rac1 activation by RhoA and Rap1 may function through independent regulators where RhoA signaling may require additional input from upstream pathways stimulated by IgG-opsonized particles. in this signaling system, the sole knockdown of Vav2 by siRNA effectively reduced Rac1 activation by EPAC/Rap1 suggesting Vav2 as the major Rac1 GEF. eric liu: the role of EPAC in macrophages has begun to be appreciated. liu: treatment in cancer biology may benefit from applying findings to tumor-associated macrophages to enhance re-education to M1 phenotypes and FcR-mediated phagocytosis by EPAC inhibition. liu: the role of EPAC in macrophages has begun to be appreciated as studies continue to grow. dysfunction of the maturation process can result in failure to activate T cells and subsequent T-cell tolerance (239, 403) overactivation of DCs is detrimental to the host and upsets the balance in the opposing direction leading to uncontrolled inflammation and autoimmunity. maturation/transcriptional regulation can assist in priming of the immune system or alternatively inducing tolerance. motactic migration for lymph node homing to increase frequency of T-cell encounters. activation of PKA enhances intrinsic DC migratory capacity observed as increased chemotaxis towards CXCL12. surprisingly random migration and chemokinesis are unaffected by the action of EPAC. this action of Rap1 suggests that Treg generated adenosine can induce cytoskeletal reorganization in DCs. this function may be relevant during minor injuries or cell death. but Treg cell conversion of ATP to adenosine can attract and circumvent unnecessary DC-mediated immunological responses to such nonthreatening events. the use of cAMP analogs selective for EPAC and PKA in many studies involving dendritic cell maturation and function signify regulatory actions of EPAC on PKA signaling are independent of cAMP competition between the two sensors. the role of PKA activity in this process is attenuation of TNF-, TGF-, IL-18, and IL-10 mRNA transcription. the role for PGs is often confronted with contradictions in the literature. however, some researchers report selective promotion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by PGE2 in DCs. receptor agonist imitated this chemokine profile except for one reversal. cAMP production was not detected with EP4 activation, but only after EP2 agonist stimulation. selective activation of the higher affinity EP4 receptors may initially dictate minute generation of cAMP to promote production. cAMP activation increases cAMP to inhibitory levels, shutting down IL-23 production and release, thereby inducing an anti-inflammatory signal. cAMP is one of a plethora of signals being integrated by DCs during the maturation process. selective activation of EPAC could lead to tolerance induction and attenuate allergic and autoimmune disorders. in support of this effect, a cAMP-responsive element is located within the CXCR4 promoter producing a prime target for CREB, a major PKA effector (206). the reduced expression of this chemokine receptor is attributed to an EPAC-dependent interference of PKA/CREB signaling resulting in 20% loss of CREB phosphorylation. a recent study observed the migration of DCs towards adenosine specifically generated by regulatory T cells in Boyden chambers. this action is dependent on adenosine A2A receptor expression in DCs which promotes cAMP production and subsequent activation of EPAC and Rap1 in the presence of Treg cells. coculture of DCs with Treg cells or adenosine stimulation increased Rap1 activation similar to direct stimulation of EPAC. FITC-dextran uptake was reduced by 50% by 50%. addition of EPAC activity perturbed this effect resulting in only 26% reduction. this further supports EPAC interference of PKA-mediated endocytosis and maturation of DCs. PGs are often reported to mediate anti-inflammatory actions in dendritic cells. in LPS-stimulated DCs, the presence of PGE2 reduces pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-12p70 and IL-12p40, while inversely promoting IL-10 expression. a dichotomy in the role for PGE2 may be reflective of a regulatory function dependent on differential activation of PG receptors by PGE2. in a human DC, PGE2 and the EP2 receptor agonist effectively inhibited pro-inflammatory chemokines and induced IL-10, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. cAMP production was not detected with EP4 activation, but only after EP2 agonist stimulation. selective activation of EP4 receptors increases cAMP to inhibitory levels, shutting down IL-23 production and release. selective activation of EPAC could lead to tolerance induction and attenuate allergic and autoimmune disorders. adaptive immune system is crucial for long-lasting protection from specific microbes and can be mobilized to assist an overwhelmed innate immune system during infections. a separate, yet interconnected, defense network evolved referred to as adaptive immune system. the large functional repertoire of T cells is dispersed between multiple T cell types including, but not limited to, cytotoxic T cells, T helper cells, T regulatory cells, or natural killer T cells. below the role of cAMP activation of EPAC will be discussed in various aspects of T cell functions. activation of EPAC is observed to suppress c-Jun binding of AP-1 promoter elements in a PKA-independent fashion, while PKA acts independently on CREB and ATF2. independent investigation found increased CREB and AP-1 activation with parallel attenuation of NFB and NFAT activity. this led to abrogated cytokine expression in the T cells, but not all cytokines were sensitive to PKA inhibition. PGE2 and downstream effectors PKA and EPAC appear vital to the innate suppression of allergic inflammation by CD4+ T cells. the immune system exists in a balance between induction and suppression of effector cells. cholera toxin promotes induction of cAMP in Jurkat and CD4+ T cells. cAMP may have distinct roles in differentiation or activation of Th17 cells. this suggests cAMP may have distinct roles in differentiation or activation of Th17 cells dependent on the maturity of the cell. however, to conclude the functional relevance for EPAC within T cells specifically during differentiation or activation will require further attention. the authors dismiss a redundant mechanism of PKA through inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) suppression by PKA is unaltered regardless of ICER expression (1063) inhibition of EPAC by ESI-09 reproduced the suppressed Treg function. it corroborates the role of EPAC to boost Treg suppression through TGF-1 signaling in CD4+ T cells. direct suppression of T-helper cells activity by cAMP is also reported. ive system needs to be circumvented to allow for both activation and expansion of antigen-specific T-cell clones. ive system must be circumvented to allow for both activation and expansion of antigen-specific T-cell clones. the role of EPAC in T cells is only beginning to be revealed. B cells Developing B cells undergo negative selection to eliminate self-reacting cells being released into circulation that could provoke autoimmune processes. the process induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signals in the autoreactive cell. this leads to a shift in balance between the two states of survival and apoptosis. cAMP exhibits conflicting effects on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt Ser473. inhibition of PKA was not observed to alter ERK or Akt phosphorylation during BCR ligation. the role of EPAC/Rap in this signaling paradigm is explored. in immature B cells, pro-apoptotic signaling propagation appears reliant on modulation by EPAC/Rap activation during late BCR signaling events (360) this also suggests that -IgM-induced BCR ligation induces not only the cAMP/EPAC/Rap signaling cascade to facilitate rapid Akt and ERK1/2 activation, but also other cross-talking pathways to promote BCR-induced growth arrest and apoptos forskolin treatment mimicked the effects of PDE4 inhibition. blocking PP2A returns cytochrome c release and caspase cleavage. cAMP sensor involved in mediation of these apoptotic processes. T cells T cells are a dynamically regulated set of immune cells belonging primarily to the adaptive immune system. cAMP induction in macrophages induces proliferation and pro-survival signals (710) but elevated cAMP acts to enhance p27kip1 expression. initial reports dismissed the expression of EPAC in T cells (1030), subsequent investigation reassessed these conclusions determining EPAC expression in most immune cells. results for the function of EPAC in this process are based on the leukemic Jurkat cell line and should be validated in bona fide T cells. activation of p38 phosphorylation in leukocytes was also implicated in induction of p38 phosphorylation in leukocytes. regulators of gene transcription by EPAC are not fully established, but functional consequences of cAMP signaling on cytokine production is observed in airway inflammation. elevation of cAMP by PGE2 is also reported to induce IL-23 in DCs mediating Th17 differentiation as well as promotion of Th1 differentiation. cholera toxin promotes induction of cAMP in Jurkat and CD4+ T cells and directly stimulates IL-17A production. this suggests cAMP may have distinct roles in differentiation or activation of Th17 cells dependent on the maturity of the cell. e immunosuppressive cytokines or signal through direct contact of TGF-1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) to suppress proliferation or induce anergy (661, 754, 1002, 1194) this could introduce a potentially valid approach to suppress autoimmune disorders, host defensive against organ transplant or rejection of primed T-cell immunotherapy. induction of Smad7 and reduction in TGF-1 sensitivity are both associated with STAT3 activation. phosphorylation of STAT3 was enhanced in both Treg and CD4+ T cells. this suggests that STAT3 is downstream of EPAC1 signaling. d) activation-induced cell death is induced to pave room for the next response with fresh antigen-specific T cells. controlled death of autoreactive and chronically active T cells is also important to the peripheral tolerance of the host to attenuate autoimmunity. the precise mechanism by which EPAC can influence PKA-mediated CD95L/FasL induction remains to be defined as in many signaling pathways. autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis exhibit increased PGE2 (159, 332, 551) and reduced CD95L/FasL levels. cAMP induction in macrophages induces proliferation and pro-survival signals (710). reassessed these conclusions determining EPAC expression in most immune cells, including T cells (634) results for the function of EPAC in this process are based on the leukemic cell line and should be validated in bona fide T cells. regulators of gene transcription by EPAC are not fully established. but functional consequences of cAMP signaling on T-cell cytokine production is observed in airway inflammation. agonist stimulation of PKA and EPAC both reduced IL-13 expression in splenocytes. elevation of cAMP by PGE2 is also reported to induce IL-23 in DCs mediating Th17 differentiation as well as promotion of Th1 differentiation (59, 180, 1158). this suggests PKA may function to promote T-cell expansion, while EPAC prevents excessive signal propagation by indirectly interfering with PKA action in DCs. T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) to suppress proliferation or induce anergy (661, 754, 1002, 1194) this could introduce a potentially valid approach to suppress autoimmune disorders, host defensive against organ transplant or rejection of primed T-cell immunotherapy, as well as enhance responses to infection and cancer. inhibition of STAT3 restores Treg suppression even in the absence of EPAC1. this is consistent with reports of negative regulation of STAT3 by EPAC/SOCS3 in non-immune cells. the controlled death of autoreactive and chronically active T cells is also important to the peripheral tolerance of the host to attenuate autoimmunity. the controlled death of autoreactive and chronically active T cells is also important to the peripheral tolerance of the host. the precise mechanism by which EPAC can influence PKA-mediated CD95L/FasL induction remains to be defined as in many signaling pathways. autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes exhibit increased PGE2 (159, 332, 551) and reduced CD95L/FasL levels. the survival and apoptosis signals pivot on a balance attributed to pro-apoptotic ERK1/2 activity or pro-survival PI3K-dependent Akt activity. cAMP is observed to mimic these molecular cues in immature B cells. cAMP induces a rapid yet transient generation of cAMP. activation of EPAC alone is enough to induce Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. but action of EPAC in growth arrest and apoptosis is only observed in the presence of -IgM-induced BCR ligation. this suggests that -IgM-induced BCR ligation induces not only the cAMP/EPAC/Rap signaling cascade. divergent signaling is observed in B cells and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells as compared with other cell types including T cells (1030) the anti-apoptotic effect is predominantly dependent on PDE4 while other isoforms, such as PDE3, may work loosely in tandem with PDE4 (721, 726) overall elevation of cAMP, direct activation of EPAC reduced basal apoptosis by 25%. this suggests the apoptotic signal is most likely funneling through a PKA-mediated pathway. this is further upheld by attenuated apoptosis in the presence of a PKA antagonist (1030) amyloid peptides are generated by proteolytic cleavage of the type I integral membrane glycoprotein, amyloid precursor protein (APP), diverging into either the amyloidogenic or nonamyloidogenic pathway. the nonamyloidogenic pathway produces the soluble form of APP (sAPP), by cleaving and releasing the extracellular domain from APP into the extracellular space. aves APP in the middle of the amyloid peptide sequence suggests enhanced -secretase expression/function would be a viable strategy to reduce the pathogenic amyloid peptide. induction of sAPP release does indeed exhibit neuroprotective effects (325, 667, 893) and potential memory improvement (419, 694, 699, 874, 1017) EPAC demonstrated a requirement for Rac GTPase activation by upstream Rap1 through a PKA- and Ras-independent signal (654) this important and interesting crosstalk between Rap1 and Rac in cAMP-dependent APP processing suggests the existence of an adaptor protein that could effectively activate Rac. the association of GEFs considered Rac-specific, such as Vav1, Tiam-1, and STEF (438, 666, 695, 770), was investigated. serotonin 5-HT4 receptor activation directly increases -secretase activity presumably through an EPAC/Rap1 pathway. this pathway constitutively releases sAPP, and may lead to early onset of disease. AD patients could suggest decreased trafficking of ADAM10 is implicated in the progression of the disease (869) the full nature for the activation of ADAM10 by association with 5-HT4 receptors still requires further attention to determine if this regulation assists in maturation of ADAM10 by translocating the protease to the membrane or if the receptor functions to activate the protease through an unknown mechanism. retinoid-induced heightened expression of ADAM10 does attenuate amyloid peptide production. dementia is also a common symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, linked to memory formation. altered EPAC levels observed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients may lead to the induction of dementia through disrupting memory formation. increasing melatonin levels in the presence of scopolamine could reverse these effects. increasing melatonin levels in the presence of scopolamine could reverse these effects. chronic reduction of cerebral blood flow can also lead to ischemic/hypoxic events and consequent neuronal damage. chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and amyloid peptide both promote suppression of miR-124. however, the more complex network regulating the -secretase requires greater attention. role of EPAC expression and function in Alzheimer\u2019s disease models requires greater attention. a larger patient pool is warranted to appreciate the full extent and consequences of these polymorphisms in the Alzheimer\u2019s population. genetic mutations have been associated with autistic spectrum disorders including FMR1 and TSC1/2 genes presenting as fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. however, the vast majority of individuals do not exhibit these mutations, suggesting additional genes may be involved in the development of these disorders. in autistic individuals, dendrite levels are suppressed in both the cortex and hippocampal regions, suggesting a potential dysfunction in dendrite maintenance. the identification of genetic mutations of EPAC2 in autistic families sparked an association between this cAMP receptor and the development of autism. release in presynaptic neurons by enhancing vesicle localization to the synaptic active zone through regulated localization of RIM1/Rab3 and Munc13\u20131. loss of EPAC1/2 in mice is observed to attenuate glutamate release in presynaptic terminals (1155) mutation in a purine generating enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), leads to a neurological disorder known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) loss of the HPRT enzyme modifies microRNA expression and transcriptional regulation in dopaminergic neuron pathways that are important in normal neurodevelopment. HPRT-deficient neurons appear to exhibit disorganized F-actin architecture along the cell periphery in accordance with reduced EPAC/Rap1 signaling. increased motility of neurons during early neurodevelopment could affect the initial neuronal circuitry connections. fluoxetine has shown similar increases in cAMP levels subsequently enhancing PKA/CREB activity for altered hippocampal neurogenesis (310, 611, 657). fluoxetine could effectively reverse the effects from EPAC2 deletion by increasing neurogenesis and bestowing an antidepressant activity in these mice, suggesting fluoxetine functions by stimulating parallel pathways independent of EPAC2. the use of a conditional knockout mouse model may help define precise roles for EPACs in the development of these disorders. a few studies have begun to determine the cellular and behavioral functions for EPACs in seeking substances of abuse. a followup to these studies could explore how complete loss of EPAC2 affects drug-associated memory reconsolidation. investigation into the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the EPAC gene in human subjects found a correlation between the presence of three SNPs and nicotine dependence, while one was associated with smoking initiation (171). cAMP/EPAC1 signaling pathways function antagonistically, independently or synergistically in rare occasions to modulate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. the effects of EPAC1 on cancer cell proliferation and survival are shown to be cell-type and context dependent. EPAC1 activity stimulates cell proliferation and survival by upregulating Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in prostate cancer cells. in metastatic melanoma, levels of EPAC1 expression are upregulated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma. a role of PLC/IP3 receptor-dependent intracellular Ca2+ signaling and actin assembly in EPAC1-induced melanoma cancer cell migration has also been demonstrated. the majority of evidence implicating EPAC\u2019s involvement in cancer is based on studies performed using cancer cell lines or xenograft tumor growth in animal models. most recently, a retrospective cohort study of 141 patients with gastric cancer shows that EPAC1 expression is upregulated in gastric cancer cells and tissues. cAMP upregulated the expression of HDAC8 and augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells in a PKA-independent and EPAC-dependent manner. the effect of cAMP was mediated by EPAC2, not EPAC1, since silencing EPAC1 using an EPAC1-specific shRNA did not block the cAMP-induced HDAC8 expression. gene knockout studies revealed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy was attenuated in EPAC1-null animals (586), but loss of EPAC1 did not alter heart size after isoproterenol or pressure overload (785, 819). a review of the EPAC-mediated signaling mechanisms in cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, and heart failure has been meticulously reviewed by two independent groups (320, 601) yama and co-workers first described role of EPAC1 in neointimal thickening. mRNA expression of EPAC1 was observed to increase in rat VSMCs. mRNA expression of EPAC1 was observed to increase in rat VSMCs. cAMP signaling was previously implicated in the closure of the ductus arteriosus through initiation of hyaluronan (HA) production. however, direct activation of EPAC does not appear to alter HA production in these cells, further supporting the opposing nature of PKA and EPAC in this signaling pathway. neointimal hyperplasia in arteries (top panel) and EPAC1-mediated pathways during phenotypic switch of contractile VSMCs to synthetic VSMCs. both in vivo and ex vivo experiments demonstrate that deletion of EPAC1 reduces mitogenic signaling in VSMCs and neointima areas. two separate models of neointimal hyperplasia have been explored in EPAC1-null animals with similar results (502, 1088) a wire injury model was employed to induce mechanical injury to mice femoral arteries. perivascular fibroblast migration was observed to be attenuated in EPAC1 knockout animals. a study investigating the action of roflumilast, a PDE4 inhibitor, on VSMC migration was observed to reduce TNF--induced expression of cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1. this function was associated with epigenetic regulation of histone H3-lysine 4 demethylation (H3K4me2) at the VCAM-1 promoter. neointima formation was reduced (597) these conclusions may suggest differential signaling mechanisms between vasculature of separate species or VSMCs harvested from vein versus artery. however, we should evaluate the results further for alternative signaling systems that may be relevant in certain disease processes. vascular injury is reported to enhance EPAC1 expression in VSMCs. inflammatory pain Proinflammatory signals released during tissue damage are major triggers of pain hypersensitivity. PGs are important inflammatory mediators implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors. in cultured DRG neurons, 2-AR/cAMP signaling acts through EPAC, but not PKA, to induce membrane translocation of the PKC-, in a PLC- and phospholipases D (PLD)-dependent manner (FIGURE 12). pharmacological activation of EPAC using a EPAC-selective agonist led to robust reduction of paw-withdrawal threshold in vivo. injection of estrogen merely 1 h before intradermal injection of the EPAC activator 007 on hindpaws of male rats suppresses EPAC-mediated mechanical hyperalgesia in a binary mode-like dose-response manner. paradoxically, estrogen alone promotes a brief membrane translocation of PKC- in male DRG neurons and induces PKC-dependent hyperalgesia in male rats. the apparent inhibition of PKC- translocation is not caused by receptor desensitization. reversing the order of treatment by activating EPAC mirrors the first isoproterenol treatment and antagonizes a second PKC- translocation. the inhibition is initiated at or downstream of EPAC. activation of calcium stores switches sensitizing stimuli into desensitizing stimuli in a CaMKII-dependent manner. based on these observations, the authors conclude that initial activation of Gs-coupled GPCRs results in hyperalgesia via EPAC/PLC/PKC- signaling. concurrent activation of the EPAC pathway resets the signaling network from pro- to anti-algetic. increased EPAC1 protein levels observed in CFA-treated rat DRG neurons. 007-mediated effects mimicking PGE2 actions on ATP current in a PKC-dependent manner. inflammatory mediator known to induce sensory hypersensitivity is mediated by PKA activation in the absence of NGF, but not in the presence of 30 ng/ml NGF. chronic exposure to NGF dose-dependently increases the expression of EPAC2 mRNA and protein, but not EPAC1 in cultured sensory neurons. 007-AM activates both Rap1 and Ras small GTPases in cultured sensory neurons. inhibition of Rap1 does not attenuate the sensitization generated by EPAC activation. a novel interplay between EPACs and Ras appears relevant to this pathway. GRK2 acts as a binding partner for EPAC1 where reduced GRK2 expression enhances the activation of EPAC, Rap1 and ERK. aggravated hyperalgesia is observed in vivo during inflammatory response via biased cAMP signaling shifting from PKA to EPAC1/Rap1, ERK/PKC- pathways. GRK2 inhibits EPAC1-to-Rap1 signaling by phosphorylating EPAC1 at Ser-108 in the DEP domain. GRK2 inhibits EPAC1-mediated sensitization of the mechanosensor Piezo2. expression levels of EPAC1 mRNA and protein, but not those of EPAC2, are significantly increased in DRG innervating the ipsilateral paw after a unilateral L5 spinal nerve transection. Conversely, SNT-induced mechanical allodynia is greatly reduced in EPAC/ and EPAC+/ mice when compared with wild-type counterparts. intraplantar administration of 007 dramatically decreased the mechanical withdrawal threshold while the levels of VEGF and pERK in both the lumbar spinal cord and DRG are increased in response to EPAC agonist. wei et al. (1104) examine the role of PKA and EPAC signaling in neuroplasticity associated with recovery after SCI. authors propose a complex role of PKA and EPAC2 in neuroplasticity after SCI. inhibition of EPAC2 alone by ESI-05 is not sufficient to affect the neurite outgrowth or pCREB level. in vivo experiments directly testing the role of EPAC2 in neuroplasticity after SCI are lacking. E. Infection and Inflammation cAMP is a potent regulator of host immune functions. an increase in intracellular cAMP suppresses innate immune functions by modulating the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. early investigations of EPAC functions in the immune system have been reported previously. both EPAC1 and PKA activation contribute to regulating inflammatory mediators produced in dendritic cells. a subsequent study reveals that EPAC1 accumulates on maturing phagosomes in response to PGE2 or 007 treatment. this association of EPAC1 with phagosomes might contribute to its functions in suppressing H2O2 production and bactericidal activity. intracellular parasitic protozoan leishmania donovani is shown to induce increased expression of COX2 elevating PGE2 production. sporozoites can pass through Kupffer cells to reach hepatocytes, employing these resident macrophages to serve as initial sites of multiplication in the mammalian host. 2-Agonist treatment of neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers dose-dependently impairs neutrophil phagocytosis. cAMP is associated with a PKA-dependent reduction in RhoA activity. 007 treatment alone reduced RhoA activity by 63% and having no effect on 2-agonist-induced inhibition of Rho activity. anthrax toxin edema factor (EF) is a highly active calmodulin-dependent AC that can dramatically increase the intracellular level of cAMP in host cells. cAMP produced by EF toxin impairs macrophage and T-cell functions by activating PKA and promoting immunological evasion for the bacteria. pathway independent of both PI3K activity and Beclin 1 by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels (689) treatment of host cells with a membrane-permeable cAMP analog inhibits Hla-induced autophagy in a PKA-independent manner. treatment of cells with purified Hla toxin or S. aureus results in decreased intracellular cAMP levels. study demonstrates new strategy for combating bacterial infection by targeting host molecule, EPAC1 in the case of rickettsiosis. conventional antibiotic treatment acts on pathogen-associated molecules. new approach may help combat current \u201cantibiotic resistance\u201d crisis. the inflammatory response begins in the injured tissue where endothelial cells respond by secreting chemoattractants to summon resident innate immune cells. transcriptional regulation of cytokines is found to be attenuated by cAMP signaling, especially EPAC mediated, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for this cAMP effector. pro-inflammatory cytokine production is suspended, and many innate leukocytes undergo apoptosis followed by subsequent macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. professional APCs from the site of insult, such as DCs and macrophages, will also migrate towards draining lymph nodes after, and potentially during, resolution in a phase termed post-resolution. inflammation in the vasculature is modulated by the immune system in response to vessel wall injury or pathogen stimulation. this response is supposed to be short-lived, clearing damaged cells or microbes then being repressed to allow initiation of repair mechanisms. however, excessive inflammation incurred at the site of injury can lead to detrimental consequences and if left unchecked can develop into chronic pathologies in the host. IL-6-mediated CCL2 induction is inhibited by cAMP activation of the downstream EPAC target SOCS3 which blocks JAK/STAT3 phosphorylation implicating EPAC in the negative-feedback loop for IL-6. further investigations connect EPAC1 activation with SOCS3 transcriptional regulation by C/EBP binding the promoter. low-molecular-weight HA fragments promoting inflammation and high-molecular-weight HA bestowing a suppressive effect (138, 139, 475, 517, 679) signaling of low-molecular-weight HA through CD44/TLR4 is also implicated in activation of NFB and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. sion development is attenuated in mice lacking both ApoE and A2A receptors observed by increased apoptosis of foam cells (1089) these results could suggest a potential role of adenosine to potentiate or suppress HA signaling dependent on the activation of specific adenosine receptor isoforms. adenosine receptor stimulation induces formation of a rich HA matrix to \u201ccatch\u201d inflammatory cells by promoting adhesion of monocytes and a pro-migratory environment for smooth muscle cell migration. this suggests that EPAC may initially act to inhibit the promotion of pro-atherogenic characteristics of SMCs, but eventually falters as the cell switches to an EPAC-independent signaling pathway. extracellular stimuli like IFN- demonstrate regulatory properties on macrophage cholesterol efflux by reducing ABCA1 transporters and promoting atherosclerosis development. knockout of IFN- in ApoE/ mice, which are prone to atherogenesis, demonstrates 60% attenuation of lesion burden. excessive inflammation in the lung contributes to pathologies including pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. extraneous inhaled agents can expedite the process by invoking unnecessary inflammation. Rap1 is often associated with the activation of Rac1 to modulate RhoA in barrier function. but targeted knockdown of afadin was sufficient to abolish protective effects of prostacyclin and EPAC activation on restoration of the barrier. this suggests Rap1 may participate in signaling events that additively affect barrier function. the presence of ANP was reported to act through PAK1 to repress association of RhoA with p115-RhoGEF. further investigation into protective signaling instilled by ANP during inflammatory-mediated barrier disruption with LPS or TNF- illustrates enhanced adherens junction remodeling along with reduction of p38 MAPK and NFB activation similar to prostacyclin (1138). this function of PGE2 is attributed to the induction of cAMP to attenuate transcriptional regulation of cytokines in T cells. loss of EP2 blocks PGE2 antagonism of IL-13 in CD4+ T cells. cAMP sensors function downstream of EP2 stimulation. CRLR and RAMP-1 are induced in M2 macrophages for CGRP to signal to raise cAMP levels and activate the preserved EPAC and PKA. loss of ECE-1 and subsequent ET-1 could ostensibly limit inflammation and fibrosis through the action of CGRP on regulation of macrophage functions. adenosine pathway activation of EPAC attenuates HA cytokine induction by suppressing NFB (911) in alveolar macrophages, a2A receptor and EPAC activation positively regulate a single HA-induced cytokine, IL-12. however, additional undiscovered regulatory pathways may modulate posttranscriptional events and affect net protein translation during inflammation. inhalation of cigarette smoke can also be attributed to heightened airway inflammation by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8. cigarette smoke stimulation is observed to deplete EPAC1 expression in cells and COPD patients, suggesting a loss of this negative-feedback mechanism correlated with advancement of disease (786). the expression of EPAC1 but not EPAC2 is reduced in human airway smooth muscle cells correlating with an increase in miRNA-7 by cigarette smoke extract. the potential loss of pulmonary EPAC1 by elevation of miRNA-7 in this pathology may, in part, explain increased inflammation, proliferation, and constriction of smooth muscle cells in COPD. this divergence of EPAC1 and EPAC2 inflammatory regulation may also be accountable for the inversed expression of IL-12 in alveolar macrophages in presence of HA and A2A stimulation mentioned previously (911) such results demonstrate the necessity of future studies to better characterize the distinct physiological and pathophysiological functions of EPAC1 and EPAC2. the effects of EPAC/Rap1 on Rac1/RhoA cytoskeletal dynamics well-positions this signaling cascade in modulating barrier integrity. cAMP is implicated in various kidney disorders including polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs), chronic kidney fibrosis, and renal failure. EPAC and PKA both contribute to the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD. ischemic acute kidney injury is a common clinical event leading to the development of chronic kidney diseases. tubular epithelial cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury contributes to renal failure. a membrane-permeable EPAC specific agonist was used by Stokman et al. (986) to demonstrate that activation of EPAC/Rap signaling preserves cell adhesions during hypoxia in vitro. adiponectin exerts renal protective effects by attenuating ANG II-induced superoxide formation and oxidative stress in primary human renal proximal tubule cells. the effect of adiponectin is dependent on adipoR1 and AMPK activation and can also be mimicked by cAMP analogs. this cAMP-associated effect of adiponectin is mediated by EPAC, not PKA. phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 activity to promote cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. this suggests a role of EPAC1 in high glucose-induced cellular hypertrophy during the development of diabetic nephropathy. in vitro podocyte injury assays reveal puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) treatment attenuates ERM phosphorylation and inhibits CLIC5 expression. both EPAC and PKA may contribute to attenuated albuminuria in ADR-induced nephrosis mice. the nonamyloidogenic pathway produces the soluble form of APP (sAPP) by cleaving and releasing the extracellular domain from APP into the extracellular space. this APP processing is carried out by membrane-anchored -secretases of the ADAM protein family including ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17/TACE. cAMP activation supports a positive role for enhancing the cleavage of APP in primary and neuronal cell lines (654, 876) this important and interesting crosstalk between Rap1 and Rac in cAMP-dependent APP processing suggests the existence of an adaptor protein that could effectively activate Rac. activation of 5-HT4 receptors enhanced sAPP secretion as previously described. this increase was effectively blocked by zinc metalloprotease inhibitors. pharmacological activation of EPAC as well as expression of constitutively active EPAC or Rac also mimicked these results. shedding was observed by RNAi-mediated knockdown in primary neurons (564), conditional knockout mice (482), and mutational prevalence of ADAM10 in late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients (524). shedding was observed by RNAi-mediated knockdown in primary neurons (564), conditional knockout mice (482), and mutational prevalence of ADAM10 in late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients (524). retinoid-induced heightened expression of ADAM10 does attenuate amyloid peptide production. dementia is also a common symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. altered EPAC levels observed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients may lead to the induction of dementia through disrupting memory formation (680, 1207) miR-124 inhibits muscarinic receptors blocking cholinergic signaling to induce short-term amnesia. in these animals, EPAC1, EPAC2, and Egr1 expression were impaired by scopolamine treatment. increasing melatonin levels in the presence of scopolamine could reverse these effects. the magnitude at which EPAC activation or the increased EPAC expression affects BACE1 was not determined (1193). the precise mechanism for miR-124 remains elusive. chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and amyloid peptide both promote suppression of miR-124. polymorphisms in the gene Rapgef4 were not attributed to mutations in the EPAC1 gene, suggesting a predominant role of EPAC2 in mood control and cognitive function. these behaviors were paired with decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and were effectively reversed by treatment with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (1207). an additional group of german families exhibiting autism did not exhibit the presence of these mutations. this suggests that although EPAC2 may not be the major contributor to autism, loss of function of this protein may increase susceptibility to developing autism in certain populations. expression of this EPAC2 variant suppressed the interaction of EPAC2 with Ras in this pathway, while preserving basal Rap1 activity (975, 1127) these results position EPAC2 G706R as key variant leading to loss of function and consequent suppression of basal dendrite maintenance. individuals with autism can also exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures. uated glutamate release and reduced seizure susceptibility. deletion of EPAC1/2 expression is protective against seizure development. loss of EPAC appears to be protective against seizure development. absence of HPRT in dopaminergic neurons, fibroblasts, and distinct murine brain regions was mapped to dysregulated expression of the miRNA-17 family cluster. the action of these modulatory miRNAs was associated with dysregulation of EPAC1/2 expression, demonstrating attenuation in human neuronlike cells and the striatum. depression-like behavior in rats was attenuated with inhibition of PKA. this unexpectedly increases hippocampal levels of cAMP and CREB phosphorylation. fluoxetine could effectively reverse the effects from EPAC2 deletion by stimulating parallel pathways independent of EPAC2. study found single nucleotide polymorphisms in EPAC1 of a Dutch population presented with altered levels of depression and anxiety (696) this function of EPAC in anxiety and anxiety is contradicted in a couple of reports where EPAC2 knockout and intrahippocampal EPAC activation did not affect anxiety of the animal (793, 974) an interesting followup to these studies could explore how complete loss of EPAC2 affects drug-associated memory reconsolidation. the notion that activation of EPAC in different regions of the brain may participate in functionally diverse roles during drug-seeking. amyloid peptides are generated by proteolytic cleavage of the type I integral membrane glycoprotein, amyloid precursor protein (APP) diverging into either the amyloidogenic or nonamyloidogenic pathway. the amyloidogenic pathway is initiated by -secretases cleaving the NH2 terminal and -secretases clipping the COOH terminal of APP to generate proaggregative amyloid peptides. activation of specific GPCRs, including serotonin 5-HT4 receptor, is shown to enhance this effect through cAMP-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms (602, 877) investigation into possible functions for EPAC in the APP processing cascade was pursued. cAMP or direct activation of EPAC in cells ectopically expressing STEF further increased Rac1 activation and subsequent sAPP secretion without altering Rap1 activation. the mutant STEF lacking the TSS domain completely abolished these effects. sAPP was cAMP-independent and was associated with increased expression of 5-HT4 receptors. stimulation of muscarinic M3 receptors or PAC1 receptors was ineffective in increasing sAPP release supporting the distinct role for 5-HT4 receptors. -secretase inhibition to attenuate amyloid peptides production has been plagued with detrimental side effects predominately involving notch pathway inhibition. a new grasp at this strategy involves development of -secretase modulators by targeting proteins including GSAP (-secretase activating protein) which selectively prevents amyloid peptides generation without affecting Notch signaling. a case study depicting a set of monozygotic twins was differentially treated with melatonin. the patient exhibited diminished impairment of memory, suggesting attenuated cognitive deterioration (116). scopolamine-induced memory impairment animal model used a scopolamine-induced memory impairment animal model. in a rat model of hypoperfusion, miR-124 levels were attenuated. in accordance with BACE1 and amyloid peptide production were augmented. similar results were obtained with intrahippocampal injections of amyloid peptide. a promising study by Zhou et al. (1207) found a dominant role of EPAC2 in mood control and cognitive function. these effects were not attributed to mutations in the EPAC1 gene, suggesting a predominant role of EPAC2 in mood control. several genome analyses have identified chromosome 2q21-q33 as a region harboring potential autism susceptibility genes (40, 126, 457, 947) one study further detected the expression of four nonsynonymous EPAC2 missense mutations in five different families that appeared to be segregated with the autistic phenotype of the individuals. gene mutations of EPAC2 in autistic families sparked association between this cAMP receptor and the development of autism. expression of this EPAC2 coding variant suppressed the interaction of EPAC2 with Ras in this pathway, while preserving basal Rap1 activity. specific binding of EPAC2 inhibits the KATP function by suppressing the open probability and efflux of K+. deletion of EPAC1/2 is observed to dysregulate KATP opening and suppress the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activation inducing a hyperpolarized state with attenuated glutamate release. a mutation in a purine generating enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), leads to a neurological disorder known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) a mutation in a purine generating enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), leads to a neurological disorder known as lesch-nyhan syndrome (LNS) fluoxetine could effectively reverse the effects from EPAC2 deletion by increasing neurogenesis and bestowing an antidepressant activity. fluoxetine could effectively reverse the effects from EPAC2 deletion by stimulating parallel pathways independent of EPAC2. EB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression are unchanged in response to EPAC2 deletion, but appear increased with fluoxetine treatment (1207) this could suggest the brain\u2019s attempt to compensate for the decreased activation of Rap1 by enhancing expression of EPAC2. this could suggest the brain\u2019s attempt to compensate for the decreased activation of Rap1 by enhancing expression of EPAC2 by enhancing expression of EPAC2. the effects of cocaine on redistribution of GluR2-lacking AMPARs were dependent on the presence of EPAC2. a follow-up to these studies could explore how complete loss of EPAC2 affects drug-associated memory reconsolidation. depression-like behavior in rats was attenuated with inhibition of PKA, which unexpectedly increases hippocampal levels of cAMP and CREB phosphorylation. fluoxetine could effectively reverse the effects from EPAC2 deletion by increasing neurogenesis and bestowing an antidepressant activity in these mice. this could suggest the brain\u2019s attempt to compensate for the decreased activation of Rap1 by enhancing expression of EPAC2. this could suggest the brain\u2019s attempt to compensate for the decreased activation of Rap1 by enhancing expression of EPAC2. this could suggest that potential disconnections between EPAC2 and Rap1 signaling may project as depression in humans (259) cocaine on redistribution of GluR2-lacking AMPARs was dependent on the presence of EPAC2. a follow-up to these studies could explore how complete loss of EPAC2 affects drug-associated memory reconsolidation. the notion that activation of EPAC in different regions of the brain may participate in functionally diverse roles during drug-seeking. cAMP/PKA signaling pathways function antagonistically, independently or synergistically in rare occasions to modulate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. effects of EPAC1 on cancer cell proliferation and survival are shown to be cell-type and context dependent. study implicates the EPAC1/Rap1 signaling pathway in promoting oncogenesis via upregulating aerobic glycolysis. many studies have established a critical role for EPAC1 in the invasion and metastasis of several cancers including melanoma (45\u201350, 333), prostate cancer (42, 362, 688, 711, 713), ovarian cancer (62, 855), pancreatic cancer (13, 17, 123, 636, 1095), cervical cancer (589 a role of PLC/IP3 receptor-dependent intracellular Ca2+ signaling and actin assembly in EPAC1-induced melanoma cancer cell migration has also been demonstrated. gene and pharmacological studies demonstrate that EPAC1 promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 by ESI-09 suppresses cell proliferation and migration, while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells (567). cAMP upregulated expression of HDAC8 and augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis in H1299 lung cancer cells in a PKA-independent and EPAC-dependent manner. the paper are based on results from one cancer cell line, the human non-small cell lung cancer cell H1299, and representative changes in HDAC8 expression depicted in the paper were modest. the role of EPAC in cardiac pathologies is often associated with the increased expression of EPAC in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. this function of EPAC in promoting hypertrophic signaling is well supported in the literature. contractile differentiated VSMCs undergo a phenotypic switch to a synthetic phenotype, migrate from the tunica media to the site of injury. excessive retention of VSMCs in the synthetic phenotype outside of the healing process can lead to promotion of neointimal hyperplasia in the vessel. model system of neointima formation where PGE2 induction of cAMP is observed to be a central mediator (1169, 1170) neointimal formation in the injured femoral artery or the ductus arteriosus was augmented by transduced EPAC1 overexpression, reinforcing the role of this cAMP effector in physiological and pathological neointimal thickening. migratory and invasive response of VSMCs to PDGF is greatly reduced in the absence of EPAC1. the suppressed migration of EPAC1-null VSMCs was investigated by Kato and colleagues. cAMP and PKA activity is unaltered (502, 1088) stents coated with rapamycin to inhibit mTOR downstream of Akt are effective strategies to reduce restenosis rates in the clinic (735, 739) however, mitochondrial dynamics are also known to participate in the induction of VSMC phenotype switching (615, 663, 1090) perivascular fibroblast migration was observed to be attenuated in neointima hyperplasia knockout animals. the second model of neointimal hyperplasia was conducted using carotid artery ligation. pharmacological treatment of wild-type mice directly phenocopied the genetic deletion of EPAC1 suggesting targeting EPAC1 is an effective strategy in the attenuation of neointima hyperplasia (1088 a system where multiple cell types can be affected to produce a net effect in seemingly opposite directions. this is suggested via EPAC/Rap1 inhibition of RhoA to disrupt the actin cytoskeletal reorganization required for migration. this model of neointima formation is not reliant on the common pathological trigger of vascular injury, but rather serum induction. phenotypic switching to a synthetic phenotype increases migration/invasion, proliferation, mitochondrial fission, and ROS production in response to PDGF promoting the formation of neointimal hyperplasia. these results are supported by three independent models of neointima formation including the intimal cushion formation during the closure of the ductus arteriosus. vascular disease During vascular injury, contractile differentiated VSMCs undergo a phenotypic switch to a synthetic phenotype. excessive retention of VSMCs in the synthetic phenotype outside of the healing process can lead to promotion of neointimal hyperplasia in the vessel. this signaling pathway is observed to induce cAMP production. migration of VSMCs to PDGF stimuli was markedly improved with activation or overexpression of EPAC1 and inversely diminished with PKA activation. the intimal cushion formation during the closure of the ductus arteriosus is a physiological model system of neointima formation where PGE2 induction of cAMP is observed to be a central mediator. two recent investigations focused on the role of EPAC1 in vascular disease. the migratory and invasive response of VSMCs to PDGF is greatly reduced. the suppressed migration of EPAC1-null VSMCs was investigated. both in vivo and ex vivo experiments demonstrate that deletion of EPAC1 reduces mitogenic signaling in VSMCs and neointima areas. mitochondrial dynamics are also known to participate in the induction of VSMC phenotype switching (615, 663, 1090) this model demonstrated the neointimal thickening was drastically attenuated in EPAC1-null animals. also, cofilin phosphorylation was enhanced in the neointimal areas of EPAC1 knockout arteries. perivascular fibroblast migration was observed to be attenuated in neointimal areas. this function was associated with epigenetic regulation of histone H3-lysine 4 demethylation (H3K4me2) at the VCAM-1 promoter. monocyte recruitment was suppressed with treatment of roflumilast or EPAC activator, and neointima formation was reduced (597) these results illustrate the complexity of the cAMP signaling system. vascular injury is reported to enhance EPAC1 expression in VSMCs where phenotypic switching increases migration/invasion, proliferation, mitochondrial fission, and ROS production. vascular injury is reported to enhance EPAC1 expression in VSMCs where phenotypic switching to a synthetic phenotype increases migration/invasion, proliferation, mitochondrial fission, and ROS production in response to PDGF promoting the formation of neointimal hyper PGs are important inflammatory mediators implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors. the acute effects of PGE2 are mediated by the classic cAMP receptor PKA, which can be blocked by PKA inhibitors (10, 633) cAMP signaling cascades could be blocked by individually distinct pharmacological inhibitors of PKC- or PLC or PLD (451) in sensory neurons. a previous study revealed that PKC- mediate -adrenergic-induced mechanical hyperalgesia only in male, but not female rats. reversing the order of treatment by activating EPAC first mirrors the first isoproterenol treatment and antagonizes a second PKC- translocation. reversing the order of treatment by activating EPAC first mirrors the first isoproterenol treatment. phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into DAG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). pharmacological inhibition of IP3Rs reverses the secondary PKC- translocation blockage. activation of the ca2+/CaMKII pathway switches the route of signaling from pro- to anti-algetic is not clear. a potential benefit of this intricate regulation is to provide an effective means to prevent nociceptive system overload in response to repeated noxious stimuli. inhibition of EPAC1 and EPAC2 using isoform-selective EPAC antagonists blocks, -meATP-evoked flinch responses. both CFA and 007 treatment enhances translocation and phosphorylation of PKC- and PKC- in DRG neurons. chronic exposure to NGF dose-dependently increases the expression of EPAC2 mRNA and protein, but not EPAC1, in cultured sensory neurons. intradermal injections of CFA into the rat hindpaw quadruples the expression of EPAC2, but not EPAC1, in the DRG and dorsal spinal cord in a NGF-dependent manner. a novel interplay between EPACs and Ras appears relevant to this pathway, rather than the canonical EPACs and Rap1 pathway. the Ras small GTPase is critical for mediating EPAC-induced sensitization in small-diameter capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons (949) however, unclear is the precise identity of the Ras isoform activated by the EPAC specific agonist, and also whether EPAC proteins are capable of activating Ras directly as Ras-GEFs aggravated hyperalgesia is observed in vivo during inflammatory response via biased cAMP signaling shifting from PKA to EPAC1/Rap1, ERK/PKC- pathways (268). aggravated hyperalgesia is observed during inflammatory response via biased cAMP signaling shifting from PKA to EPAC1/Rap1, ERK/PKC- pathways. GRK2 inhibits EPAC1-mediated sensitization of the mechanosensor Piezo2 which contributes to inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia. GRK2 inhibits established CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia without affecting normal mechanical sensitivity. PAC-selective agonist 007 reverses the development of mechanical sensitization induced by 007. intraplantar administration of 007 dramatically decreased the mechanical withdrawal threshold while the levels of VEGF and pERK in both the lumbar spinal cord and DRG are increased. wei et al. (1104) examine the role of PKA and EPAC signaling in neuroplasticity associated with recovery after SCI. cAMP-mediated signaling has been previously implicated in promoting neuron sprouting and neurite extension. cAMP-mediated signaling, particularly PKA activation, has been previously implicated in promoting neuron sprouting. a balance between EPAC and PKA has become evident for proper signal propagation of noxious stimuli in sensory neurons to maintain homeostasis. this is of particular importance considering the ongoing crisis of the \u201copioid epidemic\u201d (125) inflammatory mediators implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors block the synthesis of PGs by inhibiting cyclooxygenases. the acute effects of PGE2 are mediated by the classic cAMP receptor PKA, which can be blocked by PKA inhibitors (10, 633) a previous study revealed that PKC- mediate -adrenergic-induced mechanical hyperalgesia only in male, but not female rats (242) in humans, sex differences in pain sensing and tolerance have been well-documented. reversing the order of treatment by activating EPAC first mirrors the first isoproterenol treatment and antagonizes a second PKC- translocation. this suggests the inhibition is initiated at or downstream of EPAC. phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into DAG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) activate PKC and induce calcium release via activating IP3R. blocking calcium release or calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase reverses the inhibition of PKC- translocation in response to the application of a second stimulus. potentiation of purinergic P2X3 receptor (P2X3R) contributes to injury-induced exaggerated pain responses. inflammatory stimulus PGE2 potentiates homomeric P2X3R-mediated, fast-inactivating ATP currents in DRG neurons. flinch responses suggest EPAC1 and EPAC2 are essential in meditating P2X3R-induced hyperalgesia after inflammatory injury. inhibition of PKC- or PKC- successfully blocks EPAC agonist-induced increases to flinch responses. intradermal injections of CFA into the rat hindpaw quadruples expression of EPAC2 but not EPAC1 in the DRG and dorsal spinal cord in a NGF-dependent manner. a novel interplay between EPACs and 007-AM blocks the 007-AM-induced sensitization of cultured sensory neurons. the Ras small GTPase is critical for mediating EPAC-induced sensitization in small-diameter capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons (949) however, unclear is the precise identity of the Ras isoform activated by the EPAC specific agonist, and also whether EPAC proteins are capable of activating Ras directly as Ras-GEFs. GRK2 is also implicated in chronic pain (505, 538, 1086) induction of GRK2 expression in vivo prevented development of chronic hyperalgesia in response to carrageenan and RACK priming. increased GRK2 or decreasing EPAC1 also inhibited chronic pain in the CFA chronic inflammatory pain model (1087) ESI-09 inhibits established CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia without affecting normal mechanical sensitivity. using sensory neuron-specific overexpression of GRK2 or its kinase-dead mutant in vivo, these results demonstrate that the balance between GRK2 and EPAC1 signaling is crucial in pain sensitivity. intraplantar administration of 007 dramatically reverses development of mechanical sensitization induced by 007. results suggest that EPAC1 plays a role in pain sensitization during postoperative recovery. cAMP-mediated signaling has been previously implicated in promoting neuron sprouting and neurite extension. inhibition of PKA by selective agonist N6-MB-cAMP or Rp-cAMPS has no effect on the phosphorylation of CREB in cultured, conditionally immortalized mouse striatal STHdh neurons. neuropathic, and postoperative pain are becoming clearer and clearer. a delicate balance between EPAC and PKA has become evident for proper signal propagation of noxious stimuli in sensory neurons to maintain homeostasis. cAMP signaling is a potent regulator of host immune functions. in human and rat macrophages, activation of either PKA or EPAC1 inhibits H2O2 production and killing of immune serum-opsonized K. pneumoniae. also, activation of EPAC1, but not PKA, suppresses IgG-mediated phagocytosis. agocytosis mediated by complement receptor CR3 (also known as integrin M2 or Mac-1) is known to be regulated by RhoA GTPase and actin dynamics. activation of EPAC/Rap1 by 007 stimulates complement-mediated phagocytosis (684) and restores CR3-dependent phagocytosis suppressed by Rho GTPase inhibition (521) a closely related parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, increases intracellular cAMP levels of Kupffer cells by activating ACs in a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1)-dependent manner (1053) malaria sporozoites can pass through Kupffer cells to reach hepatocytes, employing these resident macrophages to serve as initial sites of multiplication in the mammalian host. cAMP signaling is a prevailing second messenger critical for sensing environmental cues in prokaryotes. many microbial pathogens use cAMP as a \u201cweapon\u201d to enhance their infectious virulence by controlling the expression of virulence genes important for regulating carbon metabolism. changes in cell morphology and motility induced by EF are mainly mediated by the cAMP/EPAC/Rap1 signaling pathway (432) in human macrophages, EF induces cytoskeletal changes, including decreased cell spreading as well as reduced filopodia generation and F-actin content. treatment of cells with purified Hla toxin or S. aureus results in decreased intracellular cAMP levels. induction of the Rapgef3 gene protects mice from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsia by suppressing bacterial adhesion and invasion into endothelial cells. deletion of the Rapgef3 gene protects mice from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsia by suppressing bacterial adhesion. PGE2 treatment inhibits HIV replication in infected human peripheral blood lymphocytes without affecting viral entry, retrotranscriptase or integrase activity, and viral protein synthesis. the effects of PGE2 can be mimicked by a specific EPAC agonist, 007. anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by cAMP/EPAC signaling may be specifically upregulated to promote inflammatory clearing. pro-inflammatory cytokine production is suspended, and many innate leukocytes undergo apoptosis followed by subsequent macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. cAMP/EPAC signaling is implicated in several pathways of inflammatory regulation. inflammation is a proper physiological response of the host. perturbations leading to excessive stimulation can lead to detrimental disease states. endothelial cells are well positioned to take on this role through secretion of chemokines to attract immunological mediators to the problematic tissue site in a host organism. chronic secretion of cytokines in response to injury induces enhanced adhesion of monocytes and T cells promoting the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. IL-6 is a prominent mediator of inflammation, but other signaling molecules are also involved in the induction of inflammatory events. HA acts to form a permissive matrix for proliferation, migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and adhesion of immunological cells. the action of HA is reported to be dependent on the molecular weight of the stimulating factor. osine signaling accumulates during tissue injury and inflammation where it is associated with SMC proliferation. discrepancies may be attributable to different receptor profiles of individual cells with A1 receptor mediating proliferation. loss of adenosine production in ApoE/ or A2B receptor-knockout mice exacerbates a pro-atherogenic phenotype. adenosine receptor stimulation induces formation of a rich HA matrix to \u201ccatch\u201d inflammatory cells by promoting adhesion of monocytes and a pro-migratory environment for smooth muscle cell migration. this suggests that EPAC may initially act to inhibit the promotion of pro-atherogenic characteristics of SMCs, but eventually falters as the cell switches to an EPAC-independent signaling pathway. s or the initial induction of HA by adenosine receptor would produce a distinct response in comparison to cells where only the latter induction of the A2A receptor is disrupted. adenosine receptor isoforms may act to modulate the level of cAMP and regulate disease progression. this anti-inflammatory signal was further extended to demonstrate that A2A receptor activation of EPAC or PKA increases apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. foam cells are reported to have increased apoptosis conferring a protective effect against lesion development (1089) loss of A2A receptors may function in surrounding cells to trigger the apoptosis of foam cells. multiple results attribute barrier regulation to PG stimulation of cAMP. cAMP activation of both PKA and EPAC/Rap1 is implicated in this process. a recent study investigating the effects of prostacyclin treatment after LPS-mediated lung injury. the pathway invoked by ANP to decrease barrier permeability parallels the prostacyclin signaling pathway. the action of Rap1 mediates induction of Rac1-specific GEFs, Vav2 and Tiam1 to activate Rac1. inhibition or silencing of PKA, EPAC1, Rap1, Rac, or either Rac-specific GEF abolished the effect of ANP on PAK1 activation. the implication of cAMP signaling is observed by actue bronchoconstriction. the COX enzymes are responsible for the production of PGs such as PGE2. in case of airway inflammation, EP2 receptor-null mice exhibit increased airway inflammation. endothelin-1 (ET-1) is expressed by an abundance of cells and can enhance collagen synthesis and fibroblast activation to induce fibrosis (806, 951, 1140) genetic suppression of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the major enzyme responsible for ET-1 activation, in mice is observed to decrease inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis (401) HA-treated alveolar macrophages with suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, in response to A2A stimulation. adenosine suppression of TNF- was found to require expression of EPAC. adenosine pathway activation of EPAC attenuates HA-induced cytokine production by suppressing NFB. inflammatory chemokine is elevated in bronchial epithelial cells, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum of patients suffering from asthma or COPD. bradykinin functions as a modulator of IL-8 release from airway smooth muscle (188, 406, 799) the action of bradykinin on IL-8 secretion is also dependent on the MAPK signaling cascade (406) the activation of NFB by cigarette smoke extract in airway smooth muscle cells is countered by the presence of a 2-agonist or specific EPAC agonist. cigarette smoke stimulation is observed to deplete EPAC1 expression in cells and COPD patients, suggesting a loss of this negative-feedback mechanism correlated with advancement of disease (786). a follow-up study investigating the action of EPACs in cigarette-induced inflammation also reveals differential roles for EPAC1 and EPAC2 in this process. the precise mechanism by which EPAC2 enhances immune cells to contribute to this phenotype is still unclear. the final cAMP readout may depend on additional factors including cell type-dependent expression of isoforms, redundancy between isoforms, net outcome from EPAC1/EPAC2/PKA signaling pathways. chronic inflammation leading to atherosclerosis and hypertension leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. in these processes, EPAC commonly confers an anti-inflammatory signal through mediation of SOCS3 expression subsequently reducing expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. activation of either PKA or EPAC1 inhibits H2O2 production and killing of immune serum-opsonized K. pneumoniae. also activation of EPAC1, but not PKA, suppresses IgG-mediated phagocytosis. in human peripheral blood monocytes activation processes such as production of cytokines/chemokines are all suppressed by PKA activation, but not by EPAC. complement receptor CR3 (also known as integrin M2 or Mac-1) is known to be regulated by RhoA GTPase and actin dynamics. activation of EPAC/Rap1 by 007 stimulates complement-mediated phagocytosis (684) and restores CR3-dependent phagocytosis suppressed by Rho GTPase inhibition. parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, increases intracellular cAMP levels in infected macrophages by activating ACs in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1)-dependent manner (1053) malaria sporozoites can pass through Kupffer cells to reach hepatocytes, employing these resident macrophages to serve as initial sites of multiplication in the mammalian host. cAMP signaling is a prevailing second messenger critical for sensing environmental cues in prokaryotes. many microbial pathogens use cAMP as a \u201cweapon\u201d to enhance their infectious virulence by controlling the expression of virulence genes. changes in cell morphology and motility induced by EF are mainly mediated by the cAMP/EPAC/Rap1 signaling pathway (432) in human macrophages, EF induces cytoskeletal changes, including decreased cell spreading as well as reduced filopodia generation and F-actin content. anthrax EF can disrupt macrophage functions via signaling through EPAC and PKA. a new approach may help combat the current \u201cantibiotic resistance\u201d crisis. a new approach may help combat the current \u201cantibiotic resistance\u201d crisis. this approach may help combat the current \u201cantibiotic resistance\u201d crisis. GE2 treatment inhibits HIV replication in infected human peripheral blood lymphocytes without affecting viral entry, retrotranscriptase or integrase activity, and viral protein synthesis. the effects of PGE2 can be mimicked by a specific EPAC agonist, 007. EPAC1 has also been shown to regulate the replication of both Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. s and macrophages by cAMP, both EPAC1 and PKA activation contribute to regulating inflammatory mediators produced in dendritic cells. a subsequent study reveals that EPAC1 accumulates on maturing phagosomes in response to PGE2 or 007 treatment. leishmania donovani, an intracellular parasitic protozoan, is demonstrated to induce increased expression of COX2 elevating PGE2 production. sporozoites can pass through Kupffer cells to reach hepatocytes, employing these resident macrophages to serve as initial sites of multiplication in the mammalian host. cAMP signaling is a prevailing second messenger critical for sensing environmental cues in prokaryotes. microbial pathogens use cAMP as a \u201cweapon\u201d to enhance their infectious virulence by controlling the expression of virulence genes. anthrax toxin edema factor (EF) is a highly active calmodulin-dependent AC that can dramatically increase the intracellular level of cAMP in host cells. cAMP produced by EF toxin impairs macrophage and T-cell functions by activating PKA and promoting immunological evasion for the bacteria. treatment of cells with purified Hla toxin or S. aureus results in decreased intracellular cAMP levels. treatment of host cells with a membrane-permeable cAMP analog inhibits Hla-induced autophagy in a PKA-independent manner. treatment of cells with purified Hla toxin results in decreased intracellular cAMP levels. treatment targeting host molecules does not apply selective pressure directly on pathogen survival and is therefore less likely to provoke the development of resistance. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is known to trigger an inflammatory response. inflammatory response begins in the injured tissue where endothelial cells respond by secreting chemoattractants to summon resident innate immune cells. transcriptional regulation of cytokines is found to be attenuated by cAMP signaling, especially EPAC mediated, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for this cAMP effector. anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by cAMP/EPAC signaling may be specifically upregulated to promote inflammatory clearing. professional APCs from the site of insult, such as DCs and macrophages, will also migrate towards draining lymph nodes after, and potentially during resolution in a phase termed post-resolution. modulation of cAMP and subsequent PKA and EPAC1/2 signaling can effectively control the inflammatory state (822) this also suggests that perturbation of these cAMP pathways could reveal mechanisms present in chronic inflammatory pathologies that could be developed for therapeutic targeting. below we cover the roles of EPAC in vascular and pulmonary pathologies that have been initially explored in the past decade. IL-6-mediated CCL2 induction is inhibited by cAMP activation of the downstream EPAC target SOCS3. further investigations connect EPAC1 activation with SOCS3 transcriptional regulation by C/EBP binding the SOCS3 promoter (1160) and associate EPAC1 activation of PLC- and downstream signaling mediators. low-molecular-weight HA fragments promote inflammation and high-molecular-weight HA bestowing a suppressive effect. inhibition of the synthase for HA does not provide protection against atherosclerotic development, but rather initiates a pro-inflammatory effect. adenosine signaling accumulates during tissue injury and inflammation where it is associated with SMC proliferation. pan adenosine receptor agonists increase HA synthase 1 and subsequent HA generation with matrix formation in a biphasic pattern. differential receptors are involved in signal propagation at these distinct times with A2B receptors important during early induction of HA, and A2A and A3 receptors important for the later response. adenosine receptor stimulation induces formation of a rich HA matrix to \u201ccatch\u201d inflammatory cells by promoting adhesion of monocytes. this suggests that EPAC may initially act to inhibit the promotion of pro-atherogenic characteristics of SMCs, but eventually falters as the cell switches to an EPAC-independent signaling pathway. this suggests that EPAC may act to inhibit the promotion of pro-atherogenic characteristics of SMCs, but eventually falters as the cell switches extracellular stimuli like IFN- demonstrate regulatory properties on macrophage cholesterol efflux by reducing ABCA1 transporters and promoting atherosclerosis development. knockout of IFN- in ApoE/ mice, which are prone to atherogenesis, demonstrates 60% attenuation of lesion burden (384) excessive inflammation in the lung contributes to pathologies including pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. extraneous inhaled agents can expedite the process by invoking unnecessary inflammation. targeted knockdown of afadin was sufficient to abolish protective effects of prostacyclin and EPAC activation on restoration of the barrier. this suggests Rap1 may participate in a set of signaling events that additively affect barrier function. similar to prostacyclin, ANP also provides protection against thrombin-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction. further investigation into protective signaling instilled by ANP during inflammatory-mediated barrier disruption with LPS or TNF- illustrate enhanced adherens junction remodeling along with reduction of p38 MAPK and NFB activation similar to prostacyclin (1138). these studies support coordinated signaling for EPAC/Rap1/Rac and PKA in preserving pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity through increased junction formation, reduced cellular contraction, and diminished inflammatory responses. loss of EP2 blocks PGE2 antagonism of IL-13 in CD4+ T cells. cAMP sensors function downstream of EP2 stimulation. this action is a major factor to maintaining reduced inflammatory response in the lungs. CRLR and RAMP-1 are induced in M2 macrophages for CGRP to signal to raise cAMP levels and activate the preserved EPAC and PKA. loss of ECE-1 and subsequent ET-1 could ostensibly limit inflammation and fibrosis through the action of CGRP on regulation of macrophage functions. adenosine pathway activation of EPAC attenuates HA-induced cytokine induction by suppressing NFB (911) in alveolar macrophages, a2A receptor and EPAC activation positively regulate a single HA-induced cytokine, IL-12. additional undiscovered regulatory pathways may modulate posttranscriptional events and affect net protein translation during inflammation. inhalation of cigarette smoke can also be attributed to heightened airway inflammation by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 (704, 733, 777, 791, 1154) cigarette smoke stimulation is observed to deplete EPAC1 expression in cells and COPD patients. pulmonary EPAC1 may act as a gatekeeper for immunosuppression in COPD. cAMP/EPAC signaling attempts to calm the immune response. inflammatory cells begin to pour-in causing tissue damage and reduced airflow. inflammatory regulation may also be responsible for inversed expression of IL-12 in alveolar macrophages in presence of HA and A2A stimulation mentioned previously (911) this divergence of EPAC1 and EPAC2 inflammatory regulation may also be accountable for the inversed expression of IL-12 in alveolar macrophages in the presence of HA and A2A stimulation. the effects of EPAC/Rap1 on Rac1/RhoA cytoskeletal dynamics well-positions this signaling cascade in modulating barrier integrity. a) vascular inflammation. inflammation in the vasculature is modulated by the immune system in response to vessel wall injury or pathogen stimulation. endothelial cell stimulation with increasing levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R promotes production of CCL2 (MCP-1) and cell adhesion molecules. involvement of cAMP signaling in inflammatory initiation by IL-6 is suppressive. further investigations connect EPAC1 activation with SOCS3 transcriptional regulation by C/EBP binding the promoter. HA acts to form a permissive matrix for proliferation, migration of smooth muscle cells and adhesion of immunological cells. action of HA is reported to be dependent on molecular weight of the stimulating factor. low-molecular-weight HA fragments promoting inflammation and high-molecular-weight HA bestowing a suppressive effect (138, 139, 475, 517, 679) adenosine receptor agonists increase HA synthase 1 and subsequent HA generation with matrix formation in a biphasic pattern. adenosine receptor-mediated HA synthase induction was relieved in a PKA-independent manner by activation of EPAC following adenosine stimulation. adenosine receptor stimulation induces formation of a rich HA matrix to \u201ccatch\u201d inflammatory cells by promoting adhesion of monocytes and a pro-migratory environment for smooth muscle cell migration. this suggests that EPAC may initially act to inhibit the promotion of pro-atherogenic characteristics of SMCs, but eventually falters as the cell switches to an EPAC-independent signaling pathway. extracellular stimuli like IFN- demonstrate regulatory properties on macrophage cholesterol efflux. knockout of IFN- in mice, which are prone to atherogenesis, demonstrates 60% attenuation of lesion burden. loss of A2A receptor signaling may only increase lesion development. however, it is currently unclear the mechanism behind this phenotype. inflammatory mediators can participate in a number of functions in tissue. excessive inflammation in the lung contributes to pathologies. PK and NFB signaling is observed to be crucial to reduce recruitment of inflammatory cells by attenuating production and release of IL-8 and soluble ICAM-1. these reductions are recapitulated with direct activation of EPAC and lost with EPAC inhibition or Rap1 knockdown, suggesting the importance of EPAC/Rap1 in this prostacyclin-mediated suppression of inflammation. activation in suppressing endothelial barrier dysfunction may be linked to reduced contraction of the cells by attenuating RhoA/ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. the presence of ANP was also reported to act through PAK1 to repress association of RhoA with p115-RhoGEF, resulting in decreased RhoA activation (82). EP2 receptor-null mice exhibit increased airway inflammation, suggesting the suppressive role of PGE2 in this process. this function of PGE2 is attributed to the induction of cAMP to attenuate transcriptional regulation of cytokines in T cells. loss of EP2 blocks PGE2 antagonism of IL-13 in CD4+ T cells. loss of ECE-1 (401) is described to elevate cAMP through calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor-activity-modifying protein-1 (RAMP-1). also, 2 wk after bleomycin-induced lung injury, wild-type mice show decreased EPAC and PKA expression. loss of ECE-1 and subsequent ET-1 could ostensibly limit inflammation and fibrosis through the action of CGRP on EPAC- and PKA-mediated regulation adenosine suppression of TNF- was found to require expression of EPAC. activation of EPAC successfully replicated suppressive cytokine profile of adenosine. adenosine pathway activation of EPAC regulates a single HA-induced cytokine, IL-12. the action of bradykinin on IL-8 secretion is also dependent on the MAPK signaling cascade (406) bradykinin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was further elevated by both EPAC and PKA activation. secretion of IL-8 induced by bradykinin or by direct EPAC/PKA activation was completely abolished with U0126-mediated MEK inhibition. cigarette smoke stimulation is observed to deplete EPAC1 expression in cells and COPD patients, suggesting a loss of this negative-feedback mechanism correlated with advancement of disease (786). cigarette smoke stimulation is observed to deplete EPAC1 expression in cells and COPD patients, suggesting a loss of this negative-feedback mechanism correlated with advancement of disease. the precise mechanism by which EPAC2 enhances immune cells to contribute to this phenotype is still unclear, especially with many functions of cAMP and EPAC signaling reported to be anti-inflammatory. this divergence of inflammatory regulation may also be accountable for the inverse expression of IL-12 in alveolar macrophages in presence of HA and A2A stimulation mentioned previously. inconsistencies observed in adenosine A2A receptor genetic knockout models warrant additional studies exploring potential effects attributed to the surrounding cellular environment of foam cells. similar to vascular inflammation, EPAC signaling is consistently implicated in anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. a well-characterized animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) linked to mutations in the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 gene. cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts are associated with increased intracellular levels of cAMP and upregulation of EPAC1, EPAC2, and PKA regulatory subunit I expression. cAMP-mediated proliferation of PCK cholangiocytes is calcium-independent. an augmented induction in membrane translocation of 1-integrins is observed. 007 enhances the anti-ischemic potential of EPCs through activation of the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecule 1-integrins (813) ischemia-reperfusion injury is frequently associated with microvascular damage caused by inflammation and oxidative stress. prolonged activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the progression of chronic kidney diseases. adiponectin attenuates ANG II-mediated superoxide formation and oxidative stress in primary human renal proximal tubule cells. the effect of adiponectin is dependent on adipoR1 and AMPK activation. high glucose stimulation leads to hypertrophic response along with increased protein synthesis in HK-2 cells. high glucose-induced hypertrophic response is associated with an EPAC1-dependent upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 activity to promote cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. one study suggests that EPAC activates PI3K/Akt signaling via the Src kinase and EGFR pathway. the second report suggests a role of TGF-RI transactivation to mediate this pathway (121) a cAMP-like EPAC modulator commonly acts as an EPAC agonist. most of the non-cyclic nucleotide ligands tend to behave as EPAC inhibitors or antagonists. the need for selective EPAC pharmacological modulators to better understand and discern independent roles of EPAC- or PKA-mediated cAMP signaling became immediately imperative. further modifications and optimizations generated more membrane-permeable and PDE-resistant EPAC-specific agonists (838, 1075). these 2'-O-alkyl-based cAMP analogs, as well as their cellular metabolites, display activity towards multiple cellular targets. these findings raise significant concerns over the specificity of 8-CPT-cAMP analogs as cAMP mimetics. structural analysis reveals that a single amino acid determines the differential activity of 007 toward EPAC1 and EPAC2. a cAMP mimetic with an axial sulfur in the cyclic phosphate is more selective for EPAC2 with AC50 of 2.1 M and rkmax of 6.6 compared with that of EPAC1 (AC50 = 13 M; rkmax = 0.3). cyclic nucleotide analogs will likely interfere with cyclic nucleotide signaling. inhibiting PDEs increases cyclic nucleotide concentrations in cells. major efforts in discovering EPAC inhibitors have been centered on de novo high throughput screening. ESI-05 does not inhibit EPAC2 deletion mutants lacking the NH2-terminal CNB-A domain (860) molecular docking analyses suggest EPAC2 specific inhibitors cluster at an allosteric site to interact with key residues from both CNB domains. several newly synthesized EPAC2-specific antagonists are highly potent with relative binding affinities 100-fold stronger than the natural cAMP ligand. a simple addition of a Cl atom at the 5-position of the phenyl ring leads to a fivefold improvement in compound potency. another Cl addition at the 4-position generates the potent compound NY0123 with a relative binding affinity more than 35-fold higher than cAMP (1162, 1210) compounds I178, I288, and I942 could modestly suppress cAMP-mediated EPAC1 and EPAC2 activation. the discovery of first-in-class EPAC specific inhibitors will greatly facilitate this process and benefit the development of EPAC-based therapeutics (1211) ESI-09 has been shown to be effective in suppressing pancreatic cancer metastasis in vivo in an orthotopic metastatic mouse model (13). ESI-09 has been used extensively to study EPAC functions in various systems both in vitro and in vivo. further modifications and optimizations generated more membrane-permeable and PDE-resistant EPAC-specific agonists (838, 1075). these 2'-O-alkyl-based cAMP analogs, as well as their cellular metabolites, display activity towards multiple cellular targets. this leads to cross-target activities and off-target effects. the activity of the agonist leans towards EPAC1 activation with an AC50 of 1.8 M and relative maximal activity (rkmax) of 3.3 compared with EPAC2. a single amino acid determines the differential activity of 007 toward EPAC1 and EPAC2, as well as PKA. inhibiting PDEs increases cyclic nucleotide concentrations in cells. major efforts in discovering EPAC inhibitors have been centered on de novo high throughput screening (HTS) of diverse non-cyclic nucleotide small molecule libraries. ESI-05 does not inhibit EPAC2 deletion mutants lacking the NH2-terminal CNB-A domain (860) molecular docking analyses suggest EPAC2 specific inhibitors cluster at an allosteric site to interact with key residues from both CNB domains. several newly synthesized EPAC2-specific antagonists are highly potent with relative binding affinities 100-fold stronger than the natural cAMP ligand. phenyl scaffold and the 5-position of the isoxazole moiety are highly tunable for improving compound potency. a simple addition of a Cl atom at the 5-position leads to a fivefold improvement in potency. another Cl addition at the 4-position generates the potent compound NY0123 with a relative binding affinity more than 35-fold higher than cAMP (1162, 1210) noncompetitive EPAC1 inhibitors (compounds 5225554 and 5376753) have also been identified through a virtual compound screening of a library from the Chembridge database against the apo-EPAC structural model. more recently, parnell et al. (809) applied the 8-NBD-cAMP displacement HTS assay to isolated CNB domains of EPAC1 or EPAC2. additional compounds I178, I288, and I942 could modestly suppress c administration of ESI-09 in vivo completely recapitulates these knockout phenotypes (353, 962, 1088) ESI-09 has been used extensively to study EPAC functions in various systems both in vitro and in vivo. active efforts in preclinical evaluation of ESI-09-based therapeutics are also currently ongoing. cAMP signaling cascade is one of the most pharmaceutically targeted pathways. pharmacological inhibition of -ARs using -blockers is a treatment option for cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. opioid-based medications are the most potent pain-management drugs available. the study of tissue-specific and conditional EPAC knockout animal models will help to further define the physiological functions of EPAC isoforms. the rapid advancement in the genome editing field using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches should facilitate efforts to overcome this problem.
