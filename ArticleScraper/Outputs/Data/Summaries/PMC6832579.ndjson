{"summary": "viromes characterized from animals and human are comprised of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. commensal bacteriophages, which make up the major fraction of the fecal virome, can modulate the microbial community in the host body and influence host immunity. emergences of human infectious diseases have been initiated by zoonotic viruses originating from bats, rodents, and non-human primates. cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) cohort (n = 78) was comprised of two colonies, wild macaques (Wild, n = 35) captured from natural habitat located in Wat Tham Praporthisat (PPT), Saraburi (GPS: 14\u00b0 34\u2019N, 101\u00b0 08\u2019E) and wild-originated captive macaques (Captive, n = 43) captured from Khaoson-Samae the macaques were reared following standard animal biosafety guidelines. they lived in semi-opened gang cages and were fed twice a day. the age of macaques was estimated based on dental eruption pattern described previously. the samples were processed within 12 h of collection. the experimental protocol of this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NPRCT-CU (Protocol Review No. 1775005; 28 Sep 2017). the 11 L of extracted viral nucleic acid was annealed with 100 pmol of Sol A primer. reaction contained with 2 M of Sol B primer, 1.85. cDNA product can be stored in 20 \u00b0C until used. the thermal profile was composed of 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 5 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 59 \u00b0C for 60 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s. the amplified product was checked by gel electrophoresis (approximately expected size 300\u20131000 bp) the prepared library was checked by gel electrophoresis. the size of products ranged between 400\u2013600 bp. the size of products ranged between 400\u2013600 bp. the significant hits to viruses were then aligned to an in-house non-virus-non-redundant (NVNR) universal proteome database using DIAMOND [36]. matches with more significant E-values to NVNR than to the viral database were removed to eliminate false viral hits. cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primer Cyno_pico_3UTR_5,394F: 5\u2032-GCC TGT CAT TCT GGG GAT ACAT GG-3\u2032 and universal primer mix (UPM) the PCR product was purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the novel parvovirus A region with low coverage was confirmed by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. the primer for first PCR were Cyno_Parvo_1,273F: 5\u2032-TGA AGG TGC TGG TAG CTT GG-3\u2032 and Cyno_Parvo_2,827R: 5\u2032-AAA CTG CCT CTC CTT GG-3\u2032. the second PCR primers were Cyno_Parvo_1,438F: the phylogenetic trees of the NP1 and VP1 regions were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with gamma-distributed, and invariant sites (G + I) for parvovirus, the phylogenetic relationship of circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA virus was investigated by maximum likelihood method based on LG model. the age of macaques was estimated based on dental eruption pattern described previously [31]. male and female macaques were TB (Tuberculosis) negative and healthy with no apparent signs of illness. the fecal suspension was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. the supernatant (500 L) was filtered through a 0.45 m spin column filter. reaction was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h and then extracted immediately. reaction contained 0.5 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs), 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1X Invitrogen RT buffer. reaction was then incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min, 50 \u00b0C for 60 min and 70 \u00b0C for 15 min, 4 \u00b0C for 5 min, 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and held at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. 3.5 L of input DNA was mixed with 2.5 L of Tagment DNA buffer and 1.25 L of Amplicon Tagment Mix (ATM) the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then added with 3.75 L of Nextera PCR Mastermix (NPM) and 1.25 L of each multiplexing index primers was added into reaction. the purified library was quantified again by using KAPA library quantification kits for Illumina platforms. 2 nM of library was loaded with the concentration of 10 pM with 20% PhiX into miSeq sequencing platform for 2 250 cycles pair-end sequencing. filtered sequences were deduplicated if base positions 5 to 55 were identical. the first region located on the 3\u2032 end of the genome was amplified by 4F: 5\u2032-GGA TTT TTT GTT TGC AAT TCT-3\u2032 and 1,274R: 5\u2032-ACA TTC ATA GCC TGC CA-3\u2032 for the first round. the second region in the middle of genome was amplified by 2,497F: 5\u2032-TGC GTG GCG ATA TTT GCT TG-3\u2032 and 4,553R: 5\u2032-ACA cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primer Cyno_pico_3UTR_5,394F: 5\u2032-GCC TGT CAT TCT GGG GAT ACAT TCT GCA GGA AAT GG-3\u2032 and universal primer mix (UPM) the PCR thermal profile was 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 67 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 120 the amplification profile contained 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 52 \u00b0C or 54 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 90 min, and then 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. the splicing patterns of viral RNA were predicted by using neural network-based applications of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. the study population was comprised of a wild (n = 35) and captive (n = 43) populations. the average age of wild macaques was significantly higher than that of captive macaques and those that were herpes B negative. the raw sequence data generated from Illumina was processed using the in-house pipeline to deduplicate and filter low-quality sequences. the raw sequence data generated from Illumina was processed using the in-house pipeline to filter low-quality sequences. seven families of eukaryotic viruses were identified including members of the families Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Caliciviridae. most of the parvoviridae reads in wild macaques belonged to the Densovirinae subfamily known only as insect-tropic viruses therefore representing likely dietary intake. a calicivirus was found in one wild macaque with very low read numbers. the families of viruses are grouped by host types; phage, eukaryotic viruses and circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA virus. not included in Figure 1 were reads matching plant-infecting viruses in the Virgaviridae family that were detected in only two macaques. four species of mastadenoviruses were found in macaque samples. they included three strains of simian mastadenoviruses (A, B, and H) and of human mastadenovirus G. the number of hits were low possibly due to the generally respiratory tropism of this viral family. a contig (435 nt) matching enterovirus SEV-gx (NC029905) was found in a wild macaque. another picornavirus matched the WUHARV sapelovirus (JX627573) originally reported in rhesus macaque with 96.7% amino acid identity. based on P1, 2C, and 3CD amino acid sequences was performed with members of supergroup 1 as shown in Figure 3C\u2013E. the analysis confirmed that this virus was highly divergent from all recognized genera as well as other, unclassified, picornaviruses. parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, linear, single-stranded DNA viruses found in a wide range of hosts. their genomes are 4 to 6 kb in length and generally comprise two ORF encoding non-structural protein (NS) and viral structural protein (VP) four distinct parvoviruses member of the vertebrate-infecting Parvovirinae subfamily were detected. the complete coding sequences of one parvovirus were successfully assembled. the genome of novel chapparvovirus was assembled from reads matching parvoviruses in a wild macaque. two major ORFs were separated by a short 2 nucleotides region as typical of chapparvoviruses. the conserved P15 accessory protein (134 amino acids) was also recognized. simian parvo-like virus 2 partial genome submitted to GenBank lacked VP1 sequences. the VP1 of mafachavirus sequenced here was distantly related to that of porcine parvovirus 7 with 54% amino acid identity. the phylogenetic relationship of this novel chapparvovirus was also investigated. CRESS-DNA Virus Circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA viruses make up large and diverse group of small DNA viruses. their general genomic structure consists of two genes encoding the replication-associated protein (Rep) and the nucleocapsid (Cap) the genome size varies among groups generally ranging from 1.7 kb to 3 kb. stem-loop origin of replication contains a canonical nonanucleotide sequence (AGTATTAC) the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of changes per amino acid sites. phylogenetic relationship of this genome was investigated by comparison of Rep protein among representatives of CRESS virus genera shown in Figure 6B. p-Values (Herpes B Positive vs Negative) p-Values (Captive vs Wild) Age (years) a captive 3.34 1.65 4.68 1.40 2.27 0.88 0.001 *** 0.05 * wild c 5.48 4.11 6.14 4.27 2.75 1.31 0.01 ** Sex (%) b captive M 20 (46.5%) 9 (20.9%) 11 (25.6%) 0.74 0.24 F 23 (53.5%) 10 (23.3 the origins of the assembled contigs and unique reads from viral genomes were identified using BLASTx against an in house non-redundant viral protein database. the most common phage reads belonged to the Microviridae family, a rapidly expanding viral group [44], that contributed to over 70% of total viral reads. anellovirus detection was more common in captive macaques (n = 11 captive, n = 1 wild) parvovirus detection was more common in wild macaques (n = 14 wild, n = 4 captive) most reads in wild macaques belonged to the Densovirinae subfamily known only as insect-tropic viruses. not included in Figure 1 were reads matching plant-infecting viruses in the Virgaviridae family that were detected in only two macaques making up 91 and 3.6% of their identifiable viral reads. both previously described as well as novel viral genomes were detected. reads matching different virus species were assembled into larger, partial or full-length genome contigs. the herpesvirus contig (731 nt) found in this study was close to macaca nemestrina herpesvirus 7 (91.2% amino acid identity) the same macaque also shed a papillomavirus showing a contig (660 nt) showing best match to gammapapillomavirus 22 (82.5% amino acid identity) the coding sequences of the P1, 2C, and 3CD were compared to other members of supergroup 1. the member of the same genus should share >33 % amino acid identity in P1 and >36 % amino acid identity in the non-structural proteins 2C + 3CD [49] this virus may be classified into a new genus with a proposed genus name of Mafapivirus (Macaca fascicularis picornavirus; MfPiV) the phylogenetic trees of Mafapivirus 1 were plotted for (C) P1 region, (D) 2C region, and (E) 3CD region. the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of changes per amino acid site. the member of the same genus should share >33 % amino acid identity in P1 and >36 % amino acid identity in the non-structural proteins 2C + 3CD [49]. this virus may be classified into a new genus with a proposed genus name of Mafapivirus (Macaca fascicularis picornavirus; MfPiV) and proposed species name of Mafapivirus 1 (MN312220) the phylogenetic trees of Mafapivirus 1 were plotted for (C) P1 region, (D) 2C region, and (E) 3CD region. nodes in the tree represent % of bootstrapping value (1000 rounds) the peptide domains in polyprotein were identified based on comparison to the NCBI Pfam database. densoviruses in densovirinae infecting invertebrate hosts are more diverse than Parvovirinae. Sequences matching densoviruses were related to Diaphorina citri densovirus and Hymenopteran ambidensovirus with >60% amino acid identity. the protoparvovirus contigs (max length = 846 nt) were closely related to simian protoparvovirus 2 (92.0% amino acid identity) and were detected in both wild and captive macaques. the mafachavirus 1A genome sequence was assembled from reads matching parvoviruses in a wild macaque. phylogenetic trees of mafachavirus 1A and 1B were constructed based on (B) the NS1 region and (C) the VP1 region. the tree was scaled by the number of changes per amino acid site. this is the first reported simian chapparvovirus genome with complete ORFs. porcine parvovirus 7 is the closest relative of mafachavirus 1A and 1B. the novel virus clustered with that of the complete NS1 of simian parvo-like virus 3 from macaca mulatta in the us. both NS1 and VP1 transcripts are expected to be spliced onto a 5\u2032UTR region RNA. a putative upstream NS2 exon near 5\u2032 end of genome matched with recently reported NS2 sequences of mouse kidney parvovirus (YP009553676) [51] and simian parvo-like virus 1 (APC23171) simian parvo-like virus 2 partial genome submitted to GenBank (KT961661) lacked VP1 sequences. this is the first reported simian chapparvovirus genome with complete ORFs. simian parvo-like virus 2 partial genome submitted to GenBank (KT961661) lacked VP1 sequences. genome size varies between groups generally ranging from 1.7 kb to 3 kb. CRESS DNA virus-related proteins were more abundant and shedding prevalent in wild versus the captive macaque. rep sequence clustered with two unclassified CRESS viruses. the next closest Rep sequences were from hudisaviruses sequenced from feces of humans and other mammals. the stem-loop origin of replication contains a canonical nonanucleotide sequence (AGTATTAC) the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of changes per amino acid sites. nodes indicate % of bootstrapping value (1000 replicates) the microviridae has experienced a large increase in its recognized diversity. it was found that the herpes B virus sero-positivity was more prevalent in older macaques since it is typically transmitted through copulation or fighting. overall seven families of eukaryotic viruses were identified. several adenoviruses were also detected including adenovirus G in one macaque. the species-crossing capacity of adenoviruses has been demonstrated. adenoviruses were also detected in one macaque. genome is a close relative of previously reported parvoviruses. simian parvo-like viruses did not include VP1 sequence from feces of rhesus macaques. different strains of mafachaviruses were also identified in wild and captive macaques suggesting circulation throughput. the non-Circoviridae CRESS-DNA genomes found here are therefore of unknown tropism. the common detection of such genomes in fecal samples indicates that these viruses may be ingested rather than replicate in mammalian cells. the higher levels of CRESS-DNA read in wild versus captive macaques may reflect difference in their diet or prevalence of co-infecting parasites. wild cynomolgus macaques reared in captivity for one year show no reduction in complexity of their mammalian fecal virome. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) born in captivity in us primate centers showed no reduction in complexity of their fecal virome."}
