{"summary": "IDPs are abundant in all kingdoms of life; for example, more than 40% of the proteins in eukaryotic cells possess disordered regions longer than 50 residues. many IDPs are associated with human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [15]. ucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain becomes active by forming a dimer with its partner protein Max. in their unbound forms, both c-Myc and Max are disordered. however, in the dimerized forms, they undergo coupled folding and binding. Knott and Best [40] used large-scale replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations with a well-parameterized force field to obtain a conformational ensemble of the nuclear coactivator binding domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP. their simulation results were in good agreement with NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, validating the efficacy of all-atom simulations. c-Myc370\u2013409 is a 40-residue truncated construct of a full-length c-Myc. the conformational properties of c-Myc370\u2013409 in its bound state (with 10074-A4) and more dynamic unbound state, have been studied experimentally using CD and NMR spectroscopy. we back-calculated chemical shifts from the NMR-refined structure using either the SHIFTS [46] or SHIFTX [49] software. the experimental values are located close to the centers of the distributions, indicating the validity of the conformational sampling. the helix and polyproline II content of the simulated structure were consistent with the experimental structures. however, the sheet content of the simulated structures was much lower than the sheet content of the experimental structures. the deficiency of sheet content in the simulated structures might be caused by bias in the force fields. the mean radius of gyration is around 10.30.6, which is much smaller than the expected value of random coils. the mean helix content of the conformational ensemble is 27.711.1%, showing a broad distribution. s in c-Myc370\u2013409 (12 out of the 40) are charged residues. the favorable electrostatic interactions of the Arg372, Arg378, Lys389, Lys392 and Lys398 residues with the Asp379, Glu383, Glu385 and Glu409 residues are the result of the electrostatic attraction. apo c-Myc370\u2013409 is 0.14 and 0.16 in the MD simulations with explicit solvent model and REMD simulations. the relative binding free energy of c-Myc370\u2013409 with the two chiral 10074-A4 forms was analyzed from the MD trajectories using the MM/PBSA method. the difference of binding free energy between the S and R forms was close to the difference of H from MM/PBSA (3.2 kcal/mol c_Myc410\u2013437 S 16.66.9 15.57.4 1.114.3 35.83.8 R 11.27.2 12.810 1.617.2 25.73.3 The binding free energy was calculated using the MM/PBSA method. the top eight conformation clusters of the holo peptide were more highly populated compared to that of the apo peptide. the top eight conformation clusters of the holo peptide were more highly populated compared to that of the apo peptide. the fractional cluster populations are: A 14.3%, B 13.9%, C 13.7%, D 10.4%, E 7.5%, F 6.9%, G 5.4%, H 5.2%. the binding sites were determined as a function of time for two MD trajectories of holo c-Myc370\u2013409. site I was near the N-terminal and showed stronger potency than the other two sites. both the electrostatic and lennard-Jones interactions for site I were much stronger than those of the other two sites. the longest continuous binding time at one binding region within a trajectory is 800 ns for c-Myc370\u2013409. the longest continuous binding time at one binding region within a trajectory is about 200 ns for c-Myc410\u2013437. the observed \u201cbinding\u201d in the c-Myc410\u2013437 negative control was different from what is found in negative controls for conventional ordered proteins where binding is usually not observed. c-Myc370\u2013409 is a 40-residue truncated construct of a full-length c-Myc. the conformational properties of c-Myc370\u2013409 in its bound state (with 10074-A4) and more dynamic unbound state, have been studied experimentally using CD and NMR spectroscopy. s applied in current software for the calculation of chemical shifts have been optimized for ordered proteins but not for IDPs [47]. Interestingly, when we back-calculated chemical shifts from the NMR-refined structure, the resulting values also deviated from the experimental ones. the helix and polyproline II content of the simulated structures were consistent with the experimental structures. however, the sheet content of the simulated structures was much lower than that estimated from the experimental chemical shifts. the existence of residual structure may be related to the functional misfolding that prevents unwanted interactions with non-native partners. c-Myc370\u2013409 is disordered in nature and interconversions occur between dispersed structures occur. nearly one-third of the residues in c-Myc370\u2013409 (12 out of the 40) are charged residues. the favorable electrostatic interactions of the Arg372, Arg378, Lys389, Lys392 and Lys398 residues are the result of the electrostatic attraction between residues with opposite charges. repancy between the simulated and experimental chemical shifts for c-Myc370\u2013409 and c-Myc410\u2013437 is 0.14 and 0.16 in the MD simulations with explicit solvent model and REMD simulations, respectively. c-Myc370\u2013409 and the chiral 10074-A4 forms were analyzed using the MM/PBSA method [56]. c_Myc370\u2013409 S 19.96.5 15.46.7 4.513.2 38.63.8 R 16.76.9 14.37.8 2.314.7 34.94.6 c_Myc410\u2013437 S 16.66.9 15.57.4 1.114.3 35.83.8 R 11.27.2 12.810 1.617.2 25.73.3 The binding free energy was calculated using the MM/PBSA method [56] the top eight conformation clusters of the apo and holo peptides were more highly populated compared to that of the apo peptide. the top eight conformation clusters of the holo peptide were more highly populated compared to that of the apo peptide, with a total of 77% occupancy compared to 50%. representative c-Myc370\u2013409 structures for first eight clustering groups were displayed in cartoon. 10074-A4 structures were depicted as black sticks. the fractional cluster populations are: A 14.3%, B 13.9%, C 13.7%, D 10.4%, E 7.5%, F 6.9%, G 5.4%, H 5.2%. site I was near the N-terminal and showed stronger potency than the other two sites. both the electrostatic and lennard-Jones interactions for site I were much stronger than those of the other two sites. simulated binding between c-Myc410\u2013437 and 10074-A4 is shown in Figure 11. c-Myc410\u2013437 \u201cbound\u201d with 10074-A4 in most simulation durations. longest continuous binding time at one binding region within a trajectory is 800 ns for c-Myc370\u2013409. the binding of 10074-A4 and c-Myc370\u2013409 was not strong. c-Myc is a typical example of IDPs. it is sticky and binds the ligands at different regions with different interaction strengths. the ligand clouds concept describes a scenario for interactions between IDPs and small-molecule ligands. it suggests that different strategies should be developed for better rational drug design on IDPs. multiple protein conformations are selected and/or induced by the binding of a ligand on IDPs. this may extend the conformational selection-induced fit continuum in a new dimension. the conformational ensemble of c-Myc370\u2013409 was mainly stabilized by charge interactions and hydrogen bonds. ligand clouds were like ligand clouds around protein clouds. different binding probabilities indicated that the ligand could be selective and thus specific. the binding of ligand and non-ligand to target IDP could be clearly distinguished. a total of 30 replicas were adopted with temperatures ranging between 284.6 K and 608.8 K. all adjacent replicas attempted to exchange temperature every 10 ps with the average exchange rate between 35% and 40%. the apo c-Myc370\u2013409 was also simulated with the same explicit solvent model for comparison. three groups of simulations were performed, one for the apo and two for the holo. each group contained seven trajectories of 1 s. the system was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble with all-heavy atom restrained with a force constant of 239 kcal/mol. the temperature was maintained at 300 K using a V-rescale thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. both equilibrations were performed for 200 ps with a time step of 1 fs. c-Myc370\u2013409 simulations were analyzed using the GROMACS utilities [61] with either PyMol [60] or in-house scripts. each initial structure was minimized in vacuum, minimized, and equilibrated as described below. a total of 30 replicas were adopted with temperatures ranging between 284.6 K and 608.8 K. all adjacent replicas attempted to exchange temperature every 10 ps with the average exchange rate between 35% and 40%. the obtained conformations were adopted as starting conformations in the REMD simulations. the total simulation time was 34.5 s (1.15 s per replica) the trajectories of 292.2 K, 300 K and 308 K were used in the further analyses. the apo c-Myc370\u2013409 was also simulated with the same explicit solvent model for comparison. the dimensions of the box, defined as the distance between the farthest atoms of the peptide and the edge of the box, was set to 10. The system was neutralized by adding ions, and extra NaCl was added to represent a solution with an ionic strength of 0.15 M. the temperature was maintained at 300 K using a V-rescale thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. two groups of simulations were performed for each of the two chiral 10074-A4 isomers. each group contained one trajectory of 1 s; the other parameters were the same as the parameters used for the holo c-Myc370\u2013409 simulations described above. experimental values for apo c-Myc370\u2013409 are from Hammoudeh et al.
