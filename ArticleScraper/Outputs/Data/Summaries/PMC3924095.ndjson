{"summary": "a systematic sampling method was used to randomly sample a representative database from the national health insurance database in Taiwan. results We identified 10,124, 10,408, 11,209, 10,686, and 11,914 emergency room visits in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. diagnosis of injury/poisoning was the most frequently noted diagnostic category in emergency departments (EDs) in Taiwan. 62% to 91% of hospital ED directors report that overcrowding is a problem;3,4 it is a problem not limited to large urban centers. overcrowding in ED treatment areas threatens public health by compromising patient safety and jeopardizing the reliability of the entire emergency care system. METHODS Data gathering Taiwan launched a single-payer national health insurance program on march 1, 1995. as of 2007, 22.60 million of Taiwan\u2019s 22.96 million-person population were enrolled in this program. foreigners in Taiwan are also eligible to enroll this program. the contracted medical care institutions are judged to be incompatible with the provisions of the NHI Act. the expenses incurred must be borne by the medical institution where the physician practices. a Disputes Settlement Board is established under the national health insurance act. the national health research institute (NHRI) has established an NHI research database. the NHRI safeguards the privacy and confidentiality of subjects. the NHRI routinely transfers health insurance data from the NHIB to health researchers. inclusion criteria Emergency cases served by the NHI systems were classified into 38 cases. one case type concerned with emergency medical services and another concerned with \u201cemergency dentist visits\u201d do not concern the present research. 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2000\u20132004 Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Cases (%) Sex* Male 5285 (52.2) 5580 (53.6) 6000 (53.5) 5737 (53.7) 6282 (52.7) 28884 (53.2) Female 4734 (46.8) 4699 (45.1) 5095 (45.5) 4829 (45.2) 5555 (46.6) 249 the number of males was significantly higher than the number of females. there are missing data in 2000 (n = 105), 2001 (n = 129), 2002 (n = 114), 2003 (n = 120) and 2004 (n = 77). some conditions originating in the perinatal period 760\u20137712, 7714\u2013779 39 0.1 XVII.

Supplementary classification of external causes of injury and poisoning E800\u2013E999 624 1.1 XX. there were 14,842, 21,636, 9,365, and 8,498 cases in the age strata of under 18, 18\u201344, 45\u201364, and 65 years or older, respectively. the 10 most common disease categories among these different age groups were calculated and are shown in Table 3. infectious and parasitic 910 6.1 368 1.7 212 2.3 337 4.0 P 0.001 diseases (b) Endocrine, nutritional, 306 2.1 641 3.0 761 8.1 1046 12.3 P 0.001 metabolic, and immune disorders (c) diseases of the sense 606 4.1 470 2.2 296 3.2 247 2.9 P 0.001 organs (d) on average, a visit to a Taiwan ED cost NT$1792 (US$54.3) for insurers. the total cost increased significantly from 2000 to 2004. the annual rate of increase was estimated at 4.9%. in total, there were 2390 patients (4.4%) who used emergency resources without receiving pharmacologic treatment. on average, the out-of-pocket cost for residents enrolled in Taiwan\u2019s NHI programs was NT$207.8 129.3 (about 11.6% of the total cost) the distribution of final principal diagnoses at all visits was determined by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), as shown in Table 2. Diagnoses of injury or poisoning; ill-defined symptoms, signs, or conditions; and diseases of the respiratory system were the 3 most common diagnostic categories in emergency units in Taiwan. the number of males was significantly higher than the number of females. the number of males was significantly higher than the number of females. complications of pregnancy, child birth, and the puerperium 630\u2013676 393 0.7 XIV.
