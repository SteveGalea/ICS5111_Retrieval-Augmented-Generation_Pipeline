{"summary": "the disease is characterized by abortions and weak born piglets, increased mortality in suckling and weaned piglets, and respiratory disease in weaners and finishers. PRRSV belongs to the Arteriviridae family within the order Nidovirales and contains a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome ranging from 14.9 to 15.5 Kb in length [6, 7]. monitoring PRRS viruses supports modern herd management by explaining the source of found viruses. the remarkable genetic variation of PRRSV [20\u201322] makes epidemiological and molecular analysis of this virus of high importance to monitor changes of these circulating viruses. PRRSV genotype specific real-time TaqMan PCR targeting the ORF7 region of the PRRSV genome were selected. samples originated from fifty-four Dutch pig farms, predominantly located in the eastern part of the Netherlands. the 74 ORF2-ORF7 sequences were deposited in GenBank. phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA6 software. the evolutionary distances were computed by using the Maximum Likelihood method.

ORF6 and ORF7 have the highest nucleotide identity with Lelystad virus. lowest average similarity with lelystad virus was observed in ORF3. length of ORF3 and ORF4 is quite diverse among the isolates. phylogenetic topology varied per ORF for some viruses. NL/GD-4-13/2015 was placed with viruses NL/GD-3-19/2014 and NL/GD-6-7/2016 in ORF5 and ORF6. all 74 PRRSV strains belong to PRRSV-1 (Fig 1), but diversity among strains is high. the most investigated viruses form a distinct Dutch cluster based on ORF2-ORF7 sequences. the Netherlands is exporting approximately 10 million and importing half a million live pigs per year. the nucleotide identity of individual ORFs with Lelystad virus confirms that ORF6 and ORF7 are the most conserved genes. however, a primer based approach is biased in advance. this was demonstrated by the fact that some of the viruses selected for ORF2-ORF7 sequencing based on strong positive results in the detection PCR, were not picked-up. a high genetic diversity was seen for ORF5 (S1 appendix and S2 Table) of the genome region that encodes for one of the structural proteins, ORF3 is the most variable part. the 3\u2019-end of this region is prone for deletions as previously described. the variation in length of ORF4 can be explained by the fact that the 5\u2019-end of ORF4 and the 3\u2019-end of ORF3 coding regions overlap. the variation in length of ORF4 can be explained by the fact that the 5\u2019-end of ORF4 and the 3\u2019-end of ORF3 coding regions overlap and hence any deletion found in ORF3 will also affect ORF4 [47]. x)."}
