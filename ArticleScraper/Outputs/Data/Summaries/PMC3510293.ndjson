{"summary": "the mortality associated with the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, caused by the swine-origin influenza A H1N1/09 virus, was not as high as first anticipated. there are three genera of influenza virus that infect humans, influenza A, B and C viruses. influenza C virus causes seasonal influenza epidemics every 2\u20134 years (11) influenza C virus rarely causes severe illness or local epidemics because most people acquire protective antibodies early in life. influenza vaccines mediate protection through the induction of antibodies against virion surface proteins. individuals, including children, may accrue better heterosubtypic immunity. heterosubtypic, or cross-clade, memory can be broadly classified as protection induced to an influenza subtype or strain that confers protection against other strains. the progressive decline of the immune system is thought to be the principle cause of increased susceptibility to infection in the older adult. there is a clear need to develop effective and efficacious influenza vaccines for both infants and the elderly. the majority of humoral responses following influenza vaccination are directed toward HA, principally toward the globular head domain found in the HA1 segment. antigenic drift refers to small, gradual changes that occur through point mutations in the HA or NA coding genes. antibodies directed against the stalk region of HA have previously been shown to confer broad-spectrum protection toward different influenza isolates. annual vaccination with TIV is thought to be a relatively poor inducer of these cross-clade immune responses (18,23) cytotoxic CD8+ T cells play a major role and can eliminate virally infected cells. mismatch occurs approximately every 3\u20134 years (52,53) in healthy adults, parenteral vaccine efficacy against seasonal influenza is approximately 75% when the circulating influenza and vaccine strain match. efficacy decreases to 44% when mismatch occurs (30) seasonal influenza vaccines are formulated to include HA protein, or attenuated influenza virus, of the three influenza strains representative of the circulating strains in the northern or southern hemisphere. the global burden of influenza disease mainly occurs in infants aged 5 years or under; accounting for 90 million infections annually. the progressive decline of the immune system is thought to be the principle cause of increased susceptibility to infection in the older adult. the age-related decline in immune responses (immunosenescence) affects both the innate and adaptive immune response (29). Adaptive immune response following Vaccination Humoral immune response Currently licensed influenza vaccines induce a relatively narrow adaptive immune response with limited cross-clade immunity. cross-clade protection refers to protective immunity against one influenza isolate, which subsequently confers protective efficacy upon exposure to different isolates. human challenge studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between T-cell responses to viral antigens and influenza disease (38). cytotoxic CD8+ T cells play a major role and can eliminate virally infected cells (44,45), making these cells an ideal target for boosting through vaccination. cellular immunity does not prevent viral infection, but it is important in clearing and curtailing infection. antigenic shift refers to small, gradual changes that occur through point mutations in the HA or NA coding genes. most escape mutants contain mutations in the globular head domain. this region of the protein contains widespread immunodominant decoy domains, which can readily mutate without significantly affecting virus fitness. vaccinations with reformulated vaccines are required because of the antigenic differences that occur between, and even within, influenza strains. inactivated influenza vaccines routinely contain internal influenza antigens, specifically nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 (49,50), these vaccines do not boost cellular immunity to an efficacious level (49,51). mismatch between the vaccine components and circulating virus occurs approximately every 3\u20134 years (52,53) a number of strategies have been deployed to improve influenza vaccine efficacy for the elderly. the inclusion of adjuvants as a means to augment humoral immunity in the elderly has demonstrated relatively encouraging results. the inclusion of adjuvants can facilitate increased vaccine stability during storage or upon injection (62). a key restriction to certain VLP platforms is the small size of foreign epitopes that can be accommodated (for example, HA is a relatively big protein) for the generation of VLPs appropriate protein glycosylation, correct assembly and ease of purification need to be considered. the concerns may dictate the use of mammalian cell culture systems, which is a less controllable and a more costly system. virosomes are essentially assembled in vitro. there are a limited number of virosomal-adjuvanted\u2013subunit influenza vaccines currently licensed. vectored vaccines are particularly good at expressing full-length protein. viral vectored vaccination (79,80) is in contrast to the transient antigen depots following protein vaccination. increased presence of antigen may enhance survival of certain memory T cells. associated cell death following viral infection will also advantageously augment adaptive immune responses. vectored vaccines can induce high levels of protective cellular immunity. virus can infect local cells and produce high levels of protein. antigen has been detected at the immunization site up to 6 months after viral vectored vaccination. the majority of human clinical trials assessing viral vectored influenza vaccines use poxviral and adenoviral technologies. these vectors are considered lead candidates for the immunogenic delivery of antigens (77). adenoviruses (Ads) are nonenveloped DNA viruses originally identified as infectious agents responsible for certain acute respiratory infections. nonhuman Ads, principally chimpanzee origin AdC (77,87,94) are being deployed. chimeric vectors in which the Adhu5 capsid has been modified are also being deployed. recombinant Ad vectors expressing influenza viral proteins induced both cellular and humoral immunity. a phase 1 randomized, dose-escalation study expected to be completed in 2014. recombinant Ad vectors expressing the HA from H5N1 induced both cellular and humoral immunity. a follow-on trial using a nonreplicating adenovirus vectored nasally administered influenza vaccine has demonstrated that the vaccine is well tolerated. POX VIRUS Poxviruses are among the most heavily exploited viral vectors. poxviruses replicate within the cytoplasm of infected cells. they replicate within the cytoplasm of infected cells and do not integrate into the host genome. at 6\u20138 months, demonstrate an ability to boost T-cell responses (111,112) these data suggest that vector-specific immunity does not greatly impede immune responses toward target antigens. a major advantage of MVA over other vaccine preparations is that adjuvants are not required for high immunogenicity. studies in higher primates have assessed the feasibility of using hemagglutinin as an influenza vaccine. a recent phase I clinical trial assessing an MVA vector encoding nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 (MVA-NP + M1) has demonstrated that this vaccine was both safe and, more importantly, immunogenic. studies in higher primates have assessed the feasibility of using hemagglutinin as an influenza vaccine. a recent phase I clinical trial assessing an MVA vector encoding nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 (MVA-NP + M1) has demonstrated that this vaccine was both safe and, more importantly, immunogenic. these vectored vaccines have demonstrated promising immunogenicity with good safety profiles. heterosubtypic immunity toward certain influenza viruses has been induced through in ovo vaccination with a non-replicating Ad vector expressing HA from H5N9 (96). vaccination with MVA recombinants expressing the HA of H5N1 confers protection against infection with the homologous strain and also against H5 viruses from different clades. edward et al."}
