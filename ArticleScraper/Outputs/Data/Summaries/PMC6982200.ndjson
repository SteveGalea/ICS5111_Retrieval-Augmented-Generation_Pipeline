{"summary": "obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are a major worldwide epidemic. oxidative stress remains a topic of great interest, as it is critically involved in the obesity-associated phenotype. dysregulated production of reactive oxygen species induces alterations in the metabolic profile that predisposes one to associated co-morbidities. ase signaling is correlated with cellular ROS and cardiotonic steroids (CTS) the induction of conformational change and structural modulation of the Na/K-ATPase complex stimulates a signaling cascade. the trigger of these signaling pathways activates mediators associated with the overproduction of ROS and inflammatory markers, hence creating a ROS amplification loop, exacerbating the already existing condition. this review aims to independently uncover the mechanistic role of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop and the mechanisms associated with HO-1 regulation with increased oxidative stress in obesity and its associated comorbidity. systemic ROS in a diseased condition induces carbonylation of the 1 subunit. this leads to the structural formation of the 1/Src molecular complex. the binding of ouabain to the specific receptor site induces conformational changes in the molecular structure. the formation of the 1/Src molecular complex activates downstream signaling pathways, causing alterations in regulation of markers associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction. this creates an oxidant amplification loop that further causes adipocyte dysfunction, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to obesity and associated nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). HO-1 degrades heme released from oxidant destabilized heme protein. it cleaves pro-oxidant heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin (converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase) and free iron. HO-1 deficiency leads to inflammation, nephropathy and tissue iron deposition. sirtuins have been implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism with an important role in various cellular metabolic pathways. recent studies have suggested a molecular interplay between HO-1 and sirtuin1 (SIRT1), demonstrating that upregulated expression of HO-1 activity can rescue SIRT1 expression. sirtuin4 (SIRT4) has been shown to be a regulator of metabolic enzymes and antioxidant defense mechanisms in mitochondria where it has a crucial role in the Na/K-ATPase Oxidant Amplification Loop and HO-1: Implications for Obesity Obesity and its associated morbidity and mortality have been on the rise. many factors contribute to altered adipose tissue metabolism, but redox imbalance has been implicated in the pathogenic mechanism for the maintenance of the obesity phenotype. the elucidation of the critical role of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop in the generation of ROS highlighted the importance of dissecting the mechanistic interplay of this signaling mechanism in obesity. the cumulative line of evidence demonstrated the ability of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop in inducing adipocyte dysfunction in murine pre-adipocytes. decreased number of adipocytes and increased size of adipocytes. alterations were mediated by the oxidative stress-induced activation of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop. studies also reported that this activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling in obesity led to the adipocyte-specific and systemic release of inflammatory mediators. the activation of NADPH oxidase in obesity models leads to the subsequent activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) the modulatory mediators of RAS, such as angiotensin II (AngII), increase cellular heme levels by peroxynitrite inactivation, produces excessive ROS and increases the release of inflammatory cytokines. this redox imbalance leads to dyslipidemia and insulin resistance [40,41,52, d B cells (NF-) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stimulate inflammatory pathways, creating a feedback mechanism of inflammation. evidence from literature suggests a potential interaction between HO-1 and adiponectin. adiponectin is a protective adipokine and it has a significant role in insulin sensitivity. redox imbalance can generate highly toxic lipid peroxides that can induce hepatocellular injury and fibrogenesis. increased ROS has also been linked with an impairment of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling and subsequent inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway. this impairment is due to the effect of ROS on kinases downstream of the insulin receptor; the impairment of the IGF-1 pathway may be partly responsible for further damage to the liver. long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene associated with first reaction of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. oxidative stress induced by activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling was also demonstrated to increase hepatic inflammatory markers. further histological staining of liver tissues exhibited focal portal fibrosis. HO-1 deficiency in mouse models and humans causes severe chronic hepatic inflammation, iron deposition and oxidative damage in the liver. the protective effects on cultured hepatocytes seem to indicate that HO-1 acts directly on hepatic tissue. pNaKtide is a synthetic peptide that acts as an antagonist of this signaling mechanism. studies elucidating the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in obesity demonstrated an improved obesity-associated phenotype in vitro and in vivo. the systemic administration of pNaKtide showed improved adipogenesis, with a marked reduction in the adipogenic markers and reduced visceral and subcutaneous fat content. pNaKtide has been shown to effectively attenuate disease progression in atherosclerosis. disease progression mediated by activation of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop and its downstream signaling pathways. the effective blockage of this signaling mechanism by pNaKtide provides a strong evidence of its therapeutic efficacy. recent advancements in the understanding of obesity progression led investigators to use a genetic approach using lentiviral vectors. pNaKtide and the lentiviral approach using its derivative, NaKtide, seem to be highly effective in antagonizing Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling. several pharmacological inhibitors of the Src family kinase have been reported with high potency at low doses. pNaKtide specifically targets interaction of Na/K-ATPase-mediated Src activation, which limits off-target effects. other pharmacological inhibitors of Src offers limited specificity, thus limiting the clinical utility of these agents in attenuating oxidative stress-induced activation. improved metabolic parameters and attenuated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in an in vivo model of diet-induced obesity. increased HO-1 expression also resulted in decreased levels of the genes involved in adipogenesis (PPAR, C/EBP and aP-2) hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, both associated with increased adiposity, have been shown to increase plasma FFA. this imbalance and oxidative stress has been implicated in both NASH and cardiovascular diseases. the success of these strategies will open up new avenues and approaches toward the antagonism of obesity and subsequent NASH. both signaling mechanisms present therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity, NASH and cardiovascular diseases, while offering the possibility of limiting off-target effects. using genetic therapies that specifically target the tissue of interest allows the opportunity for specific expression in target tissues."}
