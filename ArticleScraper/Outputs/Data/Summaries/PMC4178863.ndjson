BMo-derived macrophages were inoculated with medium alone or PRRSV. cells were treated with poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 6 h or left untreated. qPCR was performed to analyze expression of IFN- (A and C) and IFN- (B and D) nsp4 inhibited the IFN- expression by 7%, 16%, and 27% at doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g respectively. nsp4 inhibited the IFN- expression by 7%, 16%, and 27% at doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g respectively. CRL-2843 cells were transfected with poly(IC) for 8 h. cells were treated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 6 h. nsp4 expression was analyzed using qPCR. nsp4 expression plasmids at different doses (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g) were cotransfected into CRL-2843 cells with pGL3-IFN--Luc (A) or pGL3-NF-B-Luc (B) and pRL-TK. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 2 h. poly(IC) treatment increased the level of phosphorylated IB. however, poly(IC)-induced IB phosphorylation was significantly decreased by nsp4. p65 translocation to the nucleus was also affected. cells were lysed, and then nuclear-protein (N.P) and cytoplasmic-protein (C.P) fractions were separated for detecting the distribution of p65. it is well established that nsp4 may target IKK signaling molecules. ed about 27%, 65%, and 51% in the presence of nsp4, respectively. these results suggest that nsp4 inhibits TLR3 and that RIG-I mediated the induction of IFN- and NF-B. PRRSV nsp4 is a member of a relatively rare group of proteolytic enzymes, the 3C-like serine proteases. it contains the canonical catalytic triad of His39-Asp64-Ser118 and three domains located at amino acids 1 to 69, 89 to 153, and 157 to 199, respectively. nsp4 protease activity is essential for nsp4 to inhibit IFN- production. a flag-tagged nsp11\u203212 fusion protein expression plasmid was cotransfected into HeLa cells with plasmids encoding nsp4 mutants. twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) 3A, N69, and C157 completely abolished the inhibitory ability of nsp4. the luciferase activities of the IFN- promoter and NF-B-responsive promoter were similar to the control level. similar results were obtained in porcine CRL-2843 cells. nsp4 expression plasmids (A) or nsp4 mutant expression plasmids (B) were cotransfected into HeLa cells with N-terminally flag-tagged porcine NEMO expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested, and Western blot analysis was performed 36 h after the transfection. nsp4 mutants without protease activity lost their ability to decrease endogenous NEMO. nsp4 mutants were mock infected or infected with PRRSV for 36 h. nsp4 mutants without protease activity lost their ability to decrease endogenous NEMO. the E349A mutants were cleaved in the presence of nsp4. nsp4 suppresses the NF-B signaling pathway by mediating the cleavage of NEMO to inhibit NF-B activation. we infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and blood monocyte-derived macrophages (BMo) with HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06. at 6 h poststimulation, the mRNA levels of type I IFNs were analyzed. HP-PRRSV significantly suppressed type I IFN expression to 6% (IFN-) and 60% (IFN-) of that induced by poly(IC) at 24 h postinfection, cells were treated with poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 6 h or left untreated. qPCR was performed to analyze expression of IFN- (A and C) and IFN- (B and D) nsp4 inhibited the IFN- expression by 7%, 16%, and 27% at doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g respectively. nsp4 inhibited the IFN- expression by 7%, 16%, and 27% at doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g, respectively. CRL-2843 cells were transfected with control vector or nsp4 expression plasmid. cells were treated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 6 h. data are means and SD from three independent experiments. nsp4 expression plasmids at different doses (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g) were cotransfected into cells with pGL3-IFN--Luc (A) or pGL3-NF-B-Luc (B) and pRL-TK. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) for 2 h. poly(IC) treatment increased the level of phosphorylated IB. however, p65 translocation to the nucleus was also affected. nsp4 may inhibit NF-B activation by targeting process upstream of IB. cells were lysed, and then nuclear-protein (N.P) and cytoplasmic-protein (C.P) fractions were separated for detecting the distribution of p65. histone 3 and -tubulin were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic controls. expression vectors for the signaling molecules RIG-I (A), VISA (B), TRIF (C) and IKK (D) were cotransfected into HeLa cells with pGL3-IFN--Luc, pRL-TK, and nsp4 expression plasmids. pRL-TK was used as an internal control; twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested for luciferase activity analysis. PRRSV nsp4 is a member of a relatively rare group of proteolytic enzymes, the 3C-like serine proteases. it contains the canonical catalytic triad of His39-Asp64-Ser118 and three domains located at amino acids 1 to 69, 89 to 153, and 157 to 199, respectively. to determine whether the serine protease activity was essential for nsp4 to block IFN rine protease catalytic activity is essential for nsp4 to inhibit IFN- production. nsp4 mutants were cotransfected into HeLa cells with plasmids encoding nsp4 mutants. cells were stimulated with or without poly(IC) (10 g/ml) 3A, N69, and C157 completely abolished the inhibitory ability of nsp4. the luciferase activities of the IFN- promoter and NF-B-responsive promoter were similar to the control level. similar results were obtained in porcine CRL-2843 cells. nsp4 expression plasmids (A) or nsp4 mutant expression plasmids (B) were cotransfected into HeLa cells with N-terminally flag-tagged porcine NEMO expression plasmid. Western blot analysis was performed 36 h after the transfection. nsp4 mutants without protease activity lost their ability to decrease endogenous NEMO. NEMO was cleaved when nsp4 was coexpressed, producing a smaller 40-kDa cleavage protein. mutants were mock infected or infected with PRRSV for 36 h. they either stimulated with poly(IC) or left untreated. the E349-S350 pair of NEMO is a unique cleavage site targeted by nsp4. primary sequences of amino acids 330 to 370 within porcine NEMO. in this region, glutamic acid was replaced with alanine. nsp4 mediated proteolytic cleavage, leading to suppression of NF-B signaling pathway. innate immune responses are the first line of host defense to fight virus infection. cytokines and chemokines produced by host cells are the first line of host defense to fight virus infection. the HP-PRRSV isolate exhibited more inhibition of IFN- activation in PAMs than the typical type 2 PRRSV isolate VR2332. Interestingly, HP-PRRSV infection causes much more severe symptoms, including high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality in pigs of all ages, than VR2332 infection (46). nsp4 blocked phosphorylation of IB and retained p65 in the cytoplasm. NF-B plays a critical role in the regulation of innate immunity. it is also a key regulator of cell survival, adhesion, proliferation and cell death. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) papain-like protease blocks the NF-B signaling pathway via stabilization of the NF-B inhibitor, IB; foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) Lpro regulates the activity of NF-B by degradation of nuclear p65/RalA (57\u201359). nsp4 contains three domains. nsp4 was shown to mediate the cleavage NEMO but had no such effect on IKK and IKK. nsp4 specifically targeted the E349-S350 pair within porcine NEMO, unlike the foot-and-mouth disease virus. p4 cleaves the C-terminal Zn finger-like domain, which plays a significant role as a bridge in recruiting upstream signaling molecules to activate the NF-B signaling pathway. nsp4 was proved to have the ability to inhibit IFN- production by blocking NF-B activation in HeLa cells and CRL-2843 cells."}
