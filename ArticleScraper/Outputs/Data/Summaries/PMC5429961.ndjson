{"summary": "studies have shown that innate immune disorders are closely related to autoimmune diseases. excessive inflammation can induce autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. identification of new therapeutic targets to ameliorate autoimmune pathogenesis has become a research priority. antibodies against TNF-, IL-17, and IL-23 have all been used to treat psoriasis. targeting upstream processes could decrease side effects and serve as an optimal therapeutic strategy. no rational drug target has yet been identified. ytic THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA) we differentiated mouse bone marrow cells into bone marrow-derived macrophages and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) the cells were flushed from mouse femurs and tibiae and then maintained in lineage-specific differentiation media. single-stranded CpG-ODNs were synthesized and purified by Sangon Biotech. ELISA measured the concentration of cytokines TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-23 in mouse sera. the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit. female BALB/c mice (8\u201310 weeks) were divided into placebo and treatment groups. we administered phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and CpG-c41 (320 g/20 g) to the treatment group. we topically applied 45 mg of IMQ cream to the shaved back skin of both groups once per day. animals Wide-type (WT) female BALB/c mice (8\u201310 weeks) were purchased from HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China), and TLR9/ C57BL/6 mice (6\u20138 weeks) were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine (Beijing, China). mice were kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions with free access to food and water. 70% of the cells from the BMDC cultures were CD11C+. all media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) sample proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then incubated with primary antibodies against NLRP3 (2 g/ml, R&D systems), caspase-1 (1 : 1000, Abcam), or tubulin (1 : 1000, Beyotime Biotechnology) the membranes were scanned with the ChemiDocTM XRS+ system ( samples of dorsal skin from the disease model were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h at 23\u00b0C and embedded in paraffin. for histological assessment, we prepared 5 m frozen sections of dorsal skin from 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after disease induction. all cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at 5 105 cells/200 l/well in the presence or absence of CpG-c41 (4 M) for 24 hours and stimulated as indicated: zymosan (200 g/ml), polyI:C (100 g/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), imiquimod (2 g/ml), ssRNA120 (30 g/ml) mixed with DOTAP, R8 pG-c41 appeared to have an immunosuppressive effect on TLR coactivation. we then studied the effects of CpG-c41 in vivo. serum TNF-, IL-6, and IFN- levels were elevated an hour after treatment. CpG-c41 interfered with inflammasome activation induced by R848 and CpG-1826. it decreased the levels of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 and significantly reduced IL-1 release. we did not detect polyI:C-induced inflammasome activation. ion downstream of other TLRs was related to TLR9-mediated crosstalk. nonstimulatory CpG-c41 was still able to significantly suppress release of TNF- and IL-6 induced by TLR3 and TLR7 activation in the TLR9/ BMDMs. CpG-1826 agonist lost its immunostimulatory function in TLR9/ BMDMs. results suggest that CpG-ODNs might inhibit TNF- and IL-6 induced by TLR3 and TLR7 stimulation. a psoriasis-like animal model has been developed. the IL-23/IL-17 axis is believed to play a key role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses [28] in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the axis is believed to play a key role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses [28]. nonstimulatory CpG-c41 suppresses intracellular TLR-inflammation. cytokine secretion driven by intracellular TLR activation in vitro. all cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. supernatants were determined by ELISA. bars represent mean SEM (n = 4). NS, normal saline. cpG-c41 interferes with inflammasome activation induced by R848 and CpG-1826. cells were stimulated with polyI:C (100 g/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), R848 (1 g/ml) or CpG-1826 (3 M) in the presence or absence of CpG-c41 (8 M) for 4 hours. cells were then stimulated with ATP (5 mM) for 30 min. IL-1 production in cell-free supernatants from BMDM cultures was measured. TLR9/ BMDMs were seeded into 96-well culture plates at 5 105/200 l/well. cells were stimulated with polyI:C (100 g/ml), imiquimod (2 g/ml), R848 (0.2 g/ml) and CpG-1826 (2 M) for 24 hours. IMQ-induced skin injury over the course of 6 consecutive days of treatment. the treated skin was relatively smooth with little scaling, lighter erythema, and reduced thickness at day 6. pathological analysis showed that papillary hyperplasia was reduced. in the treatment group, CpG-c41 reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased IL-23p19 release, and attenuated T cell infiltration. inflammatory infiltrates in the affected skin of mice with a psoriasis-like disease by laser confocal microscopy. these results illustrate the multiple immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on inflammation mediated by various intracellular TLRs. the members of the TLR family have unique structural features that recognize specific PAMPs. each family member may becharacterized by the signaling pathways it uses to promote inflammatory responses. CpG-c41 has a special sequence structure and an outstanding capacity to suppress TLR9 activation [22]. compared with currently available drugs, CpG-c41 would have several advantages. it selectively inhibits activation of all intracellular, but not cell membrane-bound, TLRs. study demonstrates the effects of CpG-c41 on inflammation mediated by various intracellular TLRs. authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}
