{"summary": "authors evaluated 38 of 49 available autopsy reports in a population of 636 patients. they found that premortem and postmortem findings were in complete agreement in less than one-half of these cases. most frequently missed diagnoses included myocardial infarction, carcinoma and pulmonary embolism. autopsies analyzed 100 randomly selected autopsies from each of the academic years 1960, 1970 and 1980 at one university teaching hospital. fewer cases of renal disease and pulmonary embolism but a dramatic increase in systemic bacterial, viral and fungal infections. autopsy findings helped to highlight shifts in clinical practice and to inform clinician of new sequelae of emerging treatments. autopsy findings may have important implications for quality control programs in the intensive care unit. autopsies in critically ill bone marrow transplant patients found only 7% of discrepancies would have altered therapy. provide unique and valuable data and it is not obsolete in critical illness."}
