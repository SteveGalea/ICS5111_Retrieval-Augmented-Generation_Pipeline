{"summary": "bats of different species have been recognized as important hosts of viruses from different families including rhabdoviruses [1\u20133], coronaviruses [4\u20139], filoviruses [10\u201312], flaviviruses [13,14], orthomyxoviruses [15\u201317], paramyxoviruses [20,21] and others. henipaviruses are also present in non-Pteropus fruit bats. entry of henipaviruses into host cells requires fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. the fusion protein of paramyxoviruses is synthesized as an inactive precursor F0 that is cleaved into the fusogenically active disulfide-linked heterodimer F1+F2. fusion protein of paramyxoviruses is synthesized as an inactive precursor F0. cathepsin activation of henipavirus F proteins cannot be functionally replaced by other proteases. cathepsins have been shown to be involved in the processing of several viral proteins. henipaviruses use cathepsins in the endosomal compartments by cathepsin L or B. our results show that cell lines from fruit bats have both active cathepsin and furin-like proteases capable of cleaving and activating viral fusion proteins. the dependence of Hendra virus on cathepsin L and furin-like proteases also occurs in cells of its natural fruit bat reservoir. fetus body cells (R06E) or head cells (R05T) [68] were maintained in DMEM-F12 media (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 500g of gentamicin. BEAS-2B cells, a human lung/bronchial epithelial cell line, were maintained in beGM medium containing all the recommended supplements (Lonza) vero cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 2 g of plasmid DNA, 6 l plus reagent and 4 l of lipofectamine in 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco Invitrogen) the transfection efficiency in bat cells in general was much lower than Vero cells, so transfections were performed in 100mm dishes. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 136,000xg for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-peptide sera to the F proteins and protein-A conjugated sepharose beads. cells were then sheared with a 23-gauge needle followed by centrifugation at 13,000xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. cell lysates were diluted 2 fold in 5x lysis buffer. 20 l of cell lysates were added to 70 l of ultrapure water. HK cells and P. alecto bat cells derived from different organs, Kidney (PaKi), brain (PaBr), lung (PaLu) and fetus (PaFe) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. amino acid residues 526\u2013539 or 516\u2013529 in the cytoplasmic tails of Hendra virus F or PIV5 F, respectively, were used to immunoprecipitate the F protein [52]. expression vectors pCAGGS-Hendra F or pCAGGS-PIV5 F were transfected with 2 g of plasmid DNA, 6 l of plus reagent and 4 l of lipofectamine in 0.8 ml of Opti cells were labeled for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C and lysed immediately. at the end of the chase periods, cells were washed and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl and supplemented with protease inhibitors. furin-like enzyme activity A furin-like enzyme activity assay on whole cell lysates was performed as described [70] with minor modifications. 2106 cells were collected, washed with PBS and lysed for 10 minutes on ice in 200 l of 5 lysis/reaction buffer. cells were then sheared with a 23-gauge needle followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. alecto bat furin or P. alecto cathepsin L were used as a standard reference for amino acid numbering. several cell lines derived from different bat species have been established, providing a valuable tool for in vitro studies of virus life cycles. both fusion proteins were proteolytically processed into the F1 and F2 heterodimer in R06E and PaKi cells. this indicates that cells from both P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus have active cathepsin-like and furin-like proteases capable of cleaving the Hendra viurs and PIV5 F proteins. cells were transfected with Hendra virus F or PIV5 F alone or in combination with Hendra virus G or PIV5 HN. 24 to 48 hours post transfection, cells were washed and images were taken using a Nikon digital camera mounted atop a Nikon TS100 microscope with 10x objective. more than 40% of PIV5 F0 had been proteolytically processed in both paKi and R06E fruit bat cell lines. cleavage of PIV5 F by furin generally occurs in secretory vesicles budding from the TGN. this suggests a potential difference in intracellular localization or expression of furin present in paKi and R06E cells compared to vero cells. treatment of paKi and R06E bat cells with the general cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d prevented cleavage of Hendra virus F in all cell types. inhibition of cathepsin L also ablated cleavage of F0 into the F1 and F2 heterodimer, indicating that processing of Hendra virus F protein is under control of cathepsin L in its natural reservoir host. cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra virus F were labeled with Tran 35S for 45 minutes and then chased for 3 hours at either 20\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. the cleaved F1 product of Hendra F and PIV5 F was observed following incubation at 37\u00b0C. incubation of vero cells at 20\u00b0C abolished PIV5 F processing. in addition, incubation of BHK cells at 20\u00b0C did not inhibit PIV5 F proteolytic processing. the majority of PIV5 F0 was cleaved to F1 in BHK, PaKi and R06E cells. furin protease binds catalytic sites of all seven mammalian proprotein convertases. dec-RVKR-cmk inhibits furin and furin-like proteases. effect of the furin inhibitor on processing of PIV5 F protein was minimal. cell lysates prepared from equal number of cells for each cell type were incubated with increasing concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk (50 M, 80 M, 100 M,150 M) for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C prior to the addition of the flourogenic furin substrate, Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC. 2106 cells of each cell type were lysed for 10 minutes on ice. cell lysates were incubated with increasing concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk. end-point fluorescence was measured after 4 hours using an XPS plate reader. egyptiacus cells R06E and R05T showed the next lowest furin-like activity. there was no significant difference in furin-like activity between vero and paKi cells. however, comparison of AMC release in R06E to vero or PaKi cells showed significant difference starting 18 minutes after addition of the substrate. different mammalian cell types show differences in furin-like enzyme activity. 2106 cells of each cell type were lysed for 10 minutes on ice. clarified lysates were then incubated with 10 M of furin substrate for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. compared to cathepsin L1, furin from various mammalian species had fewer amino acid changes across the entire sequence. the catalytic site of P. alecto furin contained one amino acid change not observed in any other mammalian furin. the catalytic site was extremely conserved, with a single glutamate to aspartate change in the catalytic site of Pteropus furin at position 299. membrane proximal motifs YKGL and LI are conserved in P. alecto furin. however, the first aspartate (position 768) in the acidic cluster sequence is absent in P. alecto furin. the asterisk \"*\" indicates identical residues compared to other mammalian furins. the changes in amino acid residues in P. alecto indicate conserved substitutions and semi-conserved substitutions. both fusion proteins were proteolytically processed into the F1 and F2 heterodimer in R06E and PaKi cells. this indicates that cells from both P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus have active cathepsin-like and furin-like proteases capable of cleaving the Hendra viurs and PIV5 F proteins. cells were transfected with Hendra virus F or PIV5 F alone or in combination with Hendra virus G or PIV5 HN. 24 to 48 hours post transfection, cells were washed and images were taken using a Nikon digital camera mounted atop a Nikon TS100 microscope with 10x objective. more than 40% of PIV5 F0 was cleaved more rapidly in both bat cell types compared to vero cells. cleavage of PIV5 F by furin generally occurs in secretory vesicles budding from the TGN. treatment of paKi and R06E bat cells with the general cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d prevented cleavage of Hendra virus F in all cell types. inhibition of cathepsin L also ablated cleavage of F0 into the F1 and F2 heterodimer, indicating that processing of Hendra virus F protein is under control of cathepsin L in its natural reservoir host. inhibition of cathepsin L and vesicular trafficking prevent cleavage of Hendra virus F. cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra virus F were labeled with Tran 35S for 45 minutes. followed lysis and immunoprecipitation, proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE. incubation of vero cells at 20\u00b0C abolished proteolytic processing of Hendra F in bat cells. incubation of BHK cells at 20\u00b0C did not completely inhibit PIV5 F proteolytic processing. the majority of PIV5 F0 was cleaved to F1 in BHK, PaKi and R06E cells. furin protease cleaves fusion protein of PIV5, which is processed by furin in other cell types. a small molecule inhibitor of furin, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk), has been shown to be effective in inhibiting Kex-2, the yeast endoproteinase homologue of furin. only 20% inhibition in PaKi and RO6E cells was observed compared to the control without inhibitor. lysates prepared from equal number of cells for each cell type were incubated with increasing concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C. 2106 cells of each cell type were lysed for 10 minutes on ice. cell lysates were incubated with increasing concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk. end-point fluorescence was measured after 4 hours using an XPS plate reader. R. aegyptiacus cells R06E and R05T showed the next lowest furin-like activity. there was no significant difference in furin-like activity between vero and PaKi cells. however, comparison of AMC release in R06E to vero or PaKi cells showed significant difference starting 18 minutes after addition of the substrate. different mammalian cell types show differences in furin-like enzyme activity. 2106 cells of each cell type were lysed for 10 minutes on ice. clarified lysates were then incubated with 10 M of furin substrate for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. compared to cathepsin L1, furin from various mammalian species had fewer amino acid changes across the entire sequence. the catalytic site of P. alecto furin contained one amino acid change not observed in any other mammalian furin. the catalytic site was extremely conserved, with a single glutamate to aspartate change in the catalytic site of Pteropus furin at position 299. the YKGL and LI motifs are conserved in P. alecto. however, the first aspartate in the acidic cluster sequence is absent in P. alecto furin. it is possible that the deletion of the acidic aspartate affects the phosphorylation of serine 772. catalytic site of furin highlights changes in amino acid residues in P. alecto compared to other mammalian furins. asterisk \"*\" indicates identical residues, \":\" indicates conserved substitutions and \";\" semi-conserved substitutions. o and R. aegyptiacus have homologues of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating cathepsin-dependent (Hendra virus F) and furin-dependent (PIV5 F) viral fusion proteins. this finding is consistent with previous studies showing that cells from different bat species can cleave glycoproteins of some viruses such as an African henipavirus [97,98] furin is a membrane-bound protease that circulates between the cell surface and the TGN through endosomes. proteolytic processing of the furin-dependent PIV5 F is more rapid in bat cells than in vero cells with the most rapid cleavage seen in R06E cells. however, the total furin-like enzyme activity assay showed lower total furin-like activity in R06E cells compared to Vero cells. furin is ubiquitously expressed at different levels in all tissues. mRNA levels of furin determined in different tissues showed highest levels in kidney and liver, lower levels in brain, spleen and thymus and lowest levels were detected in tissues from lung, heart and testis. thepsin-like and furin-like proteases are similar to their counterparts in other mammalian species. alterations in furin localization or activity in the bat host may affect virus replication. new viruses can be major threats to public health."}
