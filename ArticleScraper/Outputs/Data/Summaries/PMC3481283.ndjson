{"summary": "aminopeptidase N (APN)2 plays important roles in a wide range of normal physiological functions including the processing of peptide hormones. it is also known to mediate cell adhesion and endocytosis (4\u20137), it is involved in cancer progression (1, 8\u201310) and it serves as receptor for various mammalian coronaviruses (11, 12). human APN (hAPN) is a member of the M1 family of aminopeptidases, zinc metallopeptidases represented in all kingdoms of life. members of the family fall into two structural categories with either a three- or four-domain organization. hAPN-specific cyclic peptides containing the Asn-Gly-Arg motif are being developed as a means of targeting tumor cells. enzymes are thought to degrade small peptides to amino acids (30, 32, 35) this is to be contrasted with mammalian APN and ERAP1 and -2, enzymes that can generate defined peptide products (33, 34, 36) such as AngIV and peptides trimmed for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I proteins. the resultant hAPN was treated with endo--N-acetylglucosaminidase A (42) in 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 37 \u00b0C, followed by jack bean -mannosidase (Prozyme) in 50 mm MES, 0.4 mm ZnSO4, pH 5.5. the deglycosylated native and seleomethionine-labeled data were collected at the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon (Beamline CMCF-08ID-1). a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was performed at the peak (0.9795 ) of the selenium absorption edge. 5% of each dataset was flagged for the calculation of Rfree. 157.5, 115.1 158.1, 158.1, 114.8, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 Wavelength (\u00b0) 50\u20131.95 (1.98\u20131.95) 50\u20131.85 (1.88\u20131.85) 50 hAPN enzymatic activity was assayed using l-leucine-nitroanalide (Sigma) in 10 mm MES, pH 6.5. initial velocities were obtained at 298 K over a range of substrate concentrations at an enzyme concentration of 10 nm. a soluble form of hAPN (residue 66\u2013967) was expressed and purified from a stably transfected HEK 293S GnT1 cell line (40) cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 3% FBS (Invitrogen), 1 penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1 mg/liter of doxycycline (Sigma) and 1 mg/liter of aprot the selenomethionine-labeled protein was expressed by supplementing methionine-free media with 30 mg/liter of seleomethionine as previously described (41). crystallization The deglycosylated native and seleomethionine-labeled hAPN was crystallized by the hanging drop method. model building using wARP resulted in a model that was 95% complete. alternative rounds of manual rebuilding and automated refinement using REFMAC (46) and Phenix (47) were performed.

RESULTS Overall Structure of the hAPN Dimer hAPN is a 967-residue type-2 membrane glycoprotein. the native, peptide bound, and inhibitor bound structures are very similar except for a flexible loop in domain IV. the dimer possesses dimensions of 131 62 in projection, values very close to those measured by negative stain electron microscopy (135 55 ) zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) with similar affinity. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) glu411 and Gln213 (a cis peptide conserved among members of the family), residues all implicated in substrate binding and/or transition state stabilization. further support for this suggestion stems from the fact that the scissile bond (between the Val (P1) and Tyr (P1\u2032) straddles the side chain of Glu389. the carbon atoms are colored by domains as described in the legend to Fig. 1. the backbone of the structured loop is colored red. the loop buries the bound substrate and its interactions with hAPN are not that extensive. the electron density describing it is strong and its temperature factors are comparable with that of non-loop residues in the vicinity. the peptide residues make extensive interactions with hAPN and both are completely buried. a total surface area of 402 2 is buried between the loop and domain II. loop residue Phe896 makes a stacking interaction with Phe472. loop residues Gly894 and Ser895 make hydrogen bonds with Ser469 and Asn350 respectively. the interactions between hAPN and the first two residues of amastatin are very similar to those observed in the AngIV complex. hAPN carbon atoms are colored purple; the zinc ion is shown as a green sphere and water molecules as red spheres. the substrate-induced loop is colored red. the side chain of the C-terminal Leu residue occupies the S1\u2032 pocket that accommodates the Tyr (P1\u2032) side chain of AngIV and the Val (P1\u2032) side chain of amastatin, in their respective complexes. both bestatin and amastatin would block substrate binding, an observation consistent with the fact that they are both competitive inhibitors. loop residue Phe896, which formerly capped the S1 pocket, has been repositioned to accommodate the P kcat for the removal of Arg from AngIII is about 3-fold higher than that of Val from AngIV. the nature of the N-terminal amino acid does not significantly affect Km. both monomers of the hAPN dimer correspond to that of ERAP1 in its closed conformation (33, 34) each monomer in the open conformation was superimposed on the hAPN dimer through domain IV. the resultant models are free of steric clashes and with both monomers in the open conformation, the dimer takes on an S-shaped configuration. c, surface representation of hAPN with both monomers modeled in the open form. d, overlay of hAPN in c (green) with that of the model in d (blue) viewed parallel to the membrane surface. in each monomer, the catalytic site is exposed to a large internal cavity (2800 3), which is inaccessible to the bulk solvent. native, peptide bound, and inhibitor bound structures are very similar except for a flexible loop in domain IV. the dimer possesses dimensions of 131 62 in projection, values very close to those measured by negative stain electron microscopy. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) with similar affinity. in the native enzyme the zinc ion is coordinated by His388, His392, and Glu411 (of the 388HEXXHX18E411 motif) the bound peptide is poised for catalysis and represents a substrate complex. the scissile bond (between the Val (P1) and Tyr (P1\u2032) straddles the side chain of Glu389, a residue proposed to shuttle a proton from the hydrolytic water molecule to the amide nitrogen of the scissile bond. the carbon atoms are colored by domains as described in the legend to Fig. 1. the backbone of the structured loop is colored red. the loop buries the bound substrate and its interactions with hAPN are not that extensive. the electron density describing it is strong and its temperature factors are comparable with that of non-loop residues in the vicinity (supplemental Fig. S3a) loop residue Phe896 makes stacking interaction with Phe472. loop residues Gly894 and Ser895 make hydrogen bonds with Ser469 and Asn350. a total surface area of 402 2 is buried between the loop and domain II. the interactions between hAPN and the first two residues of amastatin are very similar to those observed in the bestatin complexes of other M1 enzymes (30\u201334, 53) amastatin binding also structures the flexible loop around the side chain of the leuN[OH] moiety in a fashion very similar to that observed for Val (P1) in the AngIV complex. the side chain of the C-terminal Leu residue occupies the S1\u2032 pocket that accommodates the Tyr (P1\u2032) side chain of AngIV and the Val (P1\u2032) side chain of amastatin, in their respective complexes. both bestatin and amastatin would block substrate binding, an observation consistent with the fact that they are both competitive inhibitors. the bestatin binding geometry does not mimic a true substrate complex. the loop conformation observed does provide a model for how substrates with bulky side chains at the P1 position might be accommodated. hAPN dimer correspond to that of ERAP1 in its closed conformation (33, 34) each monomer in the open conformation was superimposed on the dimer through domain IV. the resultant models are free of steric clashes and the resultant models are free of steric clashes. c, surface

catalytic site is exposed to a large internal cavity (2800 3), which is inaccessible to the bulk solvent. native, peptide bound, and inhibitor bound structures are very similar except for a flexible loop in domain IV that is structured by substrate and inhibitor binding. hAPN dimer possesses dimensions of 131 62 in projection. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) with similar affinity. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) the bound peptide is poised for catalysis and represents a substrate complex. further support stems from the fact

the scissile bond. the carbon atoms are colored by domains as described in the legend to Fig. 1. the backbone of the structured loop is colored red. the binding site is composed of residues from domain II and domain IV. loop and bound peptide make extensive interactions with hAPN. both are completely buried on the peptide. buried surface calculation shows that 715 2 of surface area is buried on the peptide. 470 2 is buried on the surface of hAPN. loop residue Phe896 makes stacking interaction with Phe472. loop residues Gly894 and Ser895 make hydrogen bonds with Ser469. the interactions between hAPN and the first two residues of amastatin are very similar to those observed in the bestatin complexes of other M1 enzymes. the interactions between bestatin and hAPN do not correspond to that of a substrate complex (Fig. 4, b and d). the carboxyl group of the C-terminal Leu residue coordinates the zinc ion in a fashion similar to that of acetate in the native structure. the side chain occupies the S1\u2032 pocket that accommodates the Tyr (P1\u2032) side chain of AngIV and the Val (P1\u2032) side chain of amastatin, in their respective complexes. both bestatin and amastatin would block substrate binding. the bestatin binding geometry does not mimic a true substrate complex. the loop conformation observed does provide a model for how substrates with bulky side chains at the P1 position might be accommodated. hAPN was treated as rigid bodies and superimposed on domains I and IV of ERAP1 in the open conformation. each monomer in the open conformation was then superimposed on the hAPN dimer through domain IV. the resultant models are free of steric clashes and the resultant models are free of steric clashes. d, surface representation of hAPN with both monomers viewed from the membrane. e, overlay of hAPN in c (green) with that of the model in d (blue) viewed parallel to membrane surface. the native, peptide bound, and inhibitor bound structures are very similar except for a flexible loop in domain IV. the dimer possesses dimensions of 131 62 in projection, values very close to those measured by negative stain electron microscopy (135 55 ) for intact porcine APN in reconstituted lipid vesicles. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) with similar affinity. zinc-depleted hAPN binds both AngIII (5 0.4 m) and AngIV (15 4 m) the bound peptide is poised for catalysis and represents a substrate complex. further support stems from the fact that the scissile bond (between the Val (P1) and Tyr (P1\u2032) straddles the side chain of

1. the backbone of the structured loop is colored red. the loop and bound peptide are not that extensive, the electron density describing it is strong and its temperature factors are comparable with that of non-loop residues in the vicinity (supplemental Fig. S3a) the Val (P1) and Tyr (P1\u2032) residues make extensive interactions with hAPN and both are completely buried. loop residue Phe896 makes stacking interaction with Phe472, and loop residues Gly894 and Ser895 make hydrogen bonds with Ser469 and Asn350 respectively. a total surface area of 402 2 is buried between the loop and domain II. amastatin binding structures the flexible loop around the side chain of the leuN[OH] moiety in a fashion very similar to that observed for Val (P1) in the AngIV complex. the hydrogen bonding pattern between the loop and other hAPN residues is essentially the same as that observed in the AngIV complex. the carboxyl group of the C-terminal Leu residue coordinates the zinc ion in a fashion similar to that of acetate in the native structure. the side chain occupies the S1\u2032 pocket that accommodates the Tyr (P1\u2032) side chain of AngIV and the Val (P1\u2032) side chain of amastatin, in their respective complexes. conformation of the structured loop in the AngIV, amastatin, and bestatin complexes provides a model for how substrates with bulky side chains at the P1 position might be accommodated (supplemental Fig. S4e). hAPN was treated as rigid bodies and superimposed on domains I and IV of ERAP1. each monomer in the open conformation was then superimposed on the dimer through domain IV. the resultant models are free of steric clashes and with both monomers in the open conformation, the dimer takes on an S-shaped configuration. an eight-residue loop forms a cap over the side chain of the N-terminal Val of AngIV in the hAPN-AngIV complex. the loop is structured in a very similar way in the amastatin complex but assumes a fundamentally different conformation in the bestatin complex. the loop conformation observed in the hAPN-AngIV complex would not accommodate the bulky N-terminal Arg residue found in AngIII. the ability of hAPN to process a range of peptide substrates is also reflected in the fact that interactions with the side chains at peptide substrate positions, P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 are such that a range of amino acid types could be accommodated. this is consistent with previous enzyme kinetic analysis that suggested that the active site of rat APN is composed of subsites recognizing the three N-terminal residues (55). hydroxyl group in the amastatin complex provide models for the position of the water molecule prior to the transition state. the deprotonated form of the -amino group of the bound substrate was found to coordinate the zinc ion in what was assumed to be an initial binding event. the binding geometry observed for bestatin does not correspond to that of a substrate complex or that observed in other known bestatin complexes (30\u201333) the hAPN-bestatin complex would be expected to facilitate the development of specific hAPN inhibitors for use as anti-cancer agents and analgesics for pain management. residues in domains II and IV serve to sandwich the peptide substrate in the closed form. a change in loop conformation or loop ordering, on peptide bond cleavage, might promote conversion to the open form and product release. the hAPN dimer provides the first example of an M1 metallopeptidase in dimeric form and its structure provides further insights into how hAPN mediates its many functions. hAPN is also involved in cell adhesion, endocytosis, and signal transduction (4\u20137, 61), processes often associated with changes in conformation. a rapid interconversion between open and closed forms would promote the efficient binding and release of AngIII and AngIV. a slower rate of interconversion might lead to processive degradation."}
