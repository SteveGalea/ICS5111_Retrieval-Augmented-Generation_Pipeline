{"summary": "the main causes of diarrhea in the first week after birth is Escherichia coli. enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens of colibacillosis in calves. the disease is rapid, from weakness, diarrhea, and dehydration to death in less than 24 hours. resistance of the calf to enteric disease is mainly related to calf immunity. infant animals should gain an adequate amount of antibodies from dam colostrum. serum and colostrum samples were collected from all their dams. a pooled serum from normal calves was used for Western blotting analysis. decyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. primary antibody was diluted in blocking solution (1/20), followed by incubation with secondary antibody (HRP-goat anti-bovine IgG) the standard curves were produced from purified bovine IgG. the data represented by titer are expressed directly for calculation of group means and standard errors of the means (SEM) values represent meanSE Antibody titer Normal group Diarrheic group Total P-value Anti-E. coli in dam serum 1154.37 23.12 1314.86 59.63 1232.99 31.93 0.012 Anti-E. coli in colostrum 1335.24 31.22 1725.89 33.47 1429.23 28.90 0.001 Anti-E. coli in calf serum 1416.17 28.31 3166.91 values represent meanSE Antibody titer Normal group Diarrheic group Total P-value Anti-E. coli in dam serum/dam total IgG 0.0479 0.002 0.0577 0.003 0.0522 0.001 0.008 Anti-E. coli in colostrum/colostrum total IgG 0.0364 0.001 0.0517 0.001 0.001 Anti-E. coli in calf serum/calf total IgG 0.06 antibody in colostrum had a highly significant positive correlation with anti-E. coli in calf serum (r=0.345, P=0.001) with total IgG of dam serum (r=-0.232), colostrum (r=-0.295) and calf serum (r=-0.196) anti-E. coli in dam serum 0.037 0.03 Anti-E. coli in colostrum -0.128 0.01 Anti-E. coli in calf serum -0.232b 0.01 Anti-E. coli in calf serum -0.295b 0.01 Anti-E. coli in calf serum -0.295b 0.01 Colostrum total IgG 0.034 0.69 Dam total IgG 0.034 1.44 Dam total IgG 0. 208 anti-E. coli in dam serum 0.212b 0.827 Anti-E. coli in calf serum 0.125 2.1398 Anti-E. coli in colostrum 0.453b 0.386 Anti-E. coli in colostrum 0.453b 2.5856 a Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed), and b Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) Western blotting showed moderate reactivity with antigens of 18-50 kDa. three major protein bands with molecular weights of 18 kDa, 32 kDa and 39 kDa were detected. diarrheic group is more in normal group than normal, while the total IgG is more in normal group. this indicates that the normal calves had consumed a greater quantity of antibodies than the diarrheic calves. the protection of the normal calves may belong to this difference. polyreactive antibodies are a major component of the natural antibody repertoire. the maternal immunity that the neonate always gets from dam is humoral immunity. cellular immunity, as mononuclear cells, has been shown to delay enteritis in the neonates. level of antibodies against whole germ bacteria (anti-E. coli) in suckling calves has been shown to not be related to the occurrence of diarrhea. this suggests immunity to diarrhea also might be correlated with other pathogens, maternal cells or cellular components as well as cytokines which are transferred by colostrum to neonatal calves."}
