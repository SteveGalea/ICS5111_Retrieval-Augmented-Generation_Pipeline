{"summary": "viral genomes of RNA viruses exhibit hyper-variations and continued mutations due to a lack of proofreading RNA dependent RNA polymerases. the number of complete viral genomes and proteomes that cover 118 taxonomy groups has reached to 2853 and 1932 in the NCBI and Uniprot databases. quantitative stable isotope labeling strategies, such as isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT), isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) others developed novel approaches such as HLA peptidome scanning chips to study host responses upon virus infection. cross-linking is a reactive cross-linking agent that could bind nucleic acids, peptides, or proteins. formaldehyde is a reactive cross-linking agent that could bind nucleic acids, peptides, or proteins. it could also react with side chains of lysine, arginine, histidine, and cysteine. some amide hydrogens at the backbone could be readily exchanged when incubated in a deuterated environment. some amide hydrogens hidden in the interior of the protein or involved in hydrogen bonding have restricted access to deuterium.
