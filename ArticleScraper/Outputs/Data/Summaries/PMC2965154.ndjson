{"summary": "Background dengue viruses (DENs) are the wildest transmitted arbovirus. DENs can cause severe flu-like illness and potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever. DF affects 100 million people and results in about 25,000 deaths annually. DF affects 100 million people and results in about 25,000 deaths annually. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific RNA degradation process in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) dsRNA corresponding to DEN sequences has been proven to mediate RNAi in mosquito cells. the mixtures of DEN specific small interfering RNAs, the hallmark of RNAi, were detected in all aforementioned studies. but little was known about the role of single siRNA with particular target sequence in the inhibition of DEN replication. four siRNA sequences were designed against different parts of the DEN-1 genome. only denSi-1 (B) transfected cells showed less CPE( +) at 7 dpi than cells transfected with other siRNAs. CPEs were observed and cell survival rates were measured by MTT assay at the 7th dpi. the cell survival rate of siRNA group increased by 2.26-fold (n = 5, P 0.05) but siRNA control group showed no significant difference (n = 5, P > 0.05) siRNA transfection efficiency and stability After transfection with FAM-labeled siRNA, fluorescent signals can be detected in more than half of C6/36 cells cytoplasm under a fluorescent microscope. the percentage of FAM positive cell at 6 h, days 1, 3, 5, and 7 were 66.0%, 52.1%, 32.0%, 13.5%, and 8.9%, respectively, by flow cytometry. four siRNA sequences were designed against different parts of the DEN-1 genome. only denSi-1 (B) transfected cells showed less CPE( +) at 7 dpi than cells transfected with other siRNAs. virus positive control group and control siRNA group showed ++++ CPE. measured by MTT assay, of siRNA group was 76.9% 4.5%, control-siRNA group was 43.9% 3.6%, and virus positive control group was 23.6% 14.6%. compared with virus positive control group, siRNA group showed significant decrease of viral. the viral RNA amount of siRNA group was reduced for 25.34 fold (about 40 fold) the inhibition rate was 97.54%. the amount of intracellular DEN-1 viral loading was measured by real time RT-PCR. RNAi is a powerful tool for studying gene function and development of gene-based therapies. ssRNA viruses such as DEN are exposed within cytoplasm and become potential targets for RNAi. dsRNA resistance has been proven to be generated by RNAi triggered from exogenous dsRNA. dsRNAs longer than 30 base pairs into mammalian cells will activate the potent interferon and protein kinase R antiviral pathways. these disadvantages largely restrict the use of long dsRNA in pre-clinical and clinical applications. siRNAs are degraded products of dsRNA with 21-25 nt in length. exogenous siRNA in Aedes albopictus cells is effective in inhibiting viral DNA replication. it is possible that the anti-viral mechanisms mediated by exogenous siRNAs may act synergistically in the protection of cells from viral attacks. DEN-1 strain GZ02-218 was passaged by infecting monolayers of C6/36 cells and viruses were harvested at 12-14 days. siRNA design and synthesis Four siRNA fragments (DenSi-14) were synthesized and purified by PAGE electrophoresis (Ambion, USA) 80% 90% cells grew into monolayer, transfected with siRNA molecules. 1.0 g siRNA and 3 l HiPerFect Transfection Reagent were used for each well. cells were washed by MEM, challenged by 100 TCID50 DEN-1 and cultured at 33\u00b0C. ral RNA Extraction kit quantified with the dengue virus real-time fluorescent RT-PCR detection kit. PCR reaction conditions were: one cycle of 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 3 min. 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 60\u00b0C for 40 sec. four siRNA fragments (DenSi-14) were synthesized and purified by PAGE electrophoresis (Ambion, USA) a siRNA fragment inconsistent containing sequence with DEN was used as the negative control (Qiagen, German) cells were washed by MEM, challenged by 100 TCID50 DEN-1 and cultured at 33\u00b0C in maintain medium for further investigation. cytopathic effect (CPE) of DEN-1 infection on C6/36 cells was evaluated under a light microscope. transfection efficiency and stability of siRNA C6/36 cells were transfected with FAM-labeled siRNAs and cultured for 7 days. fluorescence signal was observed under fluorescence microscope at 6 hours, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. china, grant number: 10YKPY28."}
