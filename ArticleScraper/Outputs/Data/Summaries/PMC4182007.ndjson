{"summary": "the advent of new imaging and \u201comic\u201d technologies has provided the ability to follow these interactions from whole animal to cellular and molecular levels. this facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing vaccines and therapeutics. advances in bioimaging provide a noninvasive means of identifying the internal systemic spread of infection in animal models. microarrays and next-generation sequencing allow a systematic, unbiased approach to defining the host response against biodefence agents, vaccines, and therapies. the aim of a microarray is to detect the presence and abundance of labelled nucleic acids (targets) in a biological sample, which will hybridise to the DNA on the array. a successful example of this has been applied to the ferret model of influenza. DNA microarrays have revolutionized our understanding of the host gene expression changes in response to infection with various pathogens. this information has been obtained from in vitro infection experiments. microarray studies performed with various Biodefence agents.

Vaccines Anthrax vaccine adjuvant CpG ODN Measure gene expression changes in mice and splenocytes treated with CpG ODN. gene expression changes in mice and splenocytes from various breds of mice. studies on human peripheral monocytes revealed that anthrax lethal toxin targets multiple normal immune-regulatory pathways that would be expected to protect the host against anthrax infection. the increase in RGS14 levels and decrease in CCR5 along with IL-1R2 impairs monocyte function and facilitates bacterial survival. protein microarrays is a more recent technology, providing a platform for high-throughput proteomics. construction is similar to DNA microarrays, except that the immobilised species is a protein or a peptide. the selected antigens demonstrated moderate specificity for recognizing Q-fever in patient sera [38] the use of protein microarrays has also aided the identification of different IgG and IgM profiles for differentiating acute and chronic Q-fever [37] and a proof-of-concept diagnostic assay (immunostrip) to distinguish the two disease states. a limited number of studies have been performed using DNA microarrays to understand the protective mechanisms of licensed or novel biodefence vaccines. DNA arrays have been used to examine the immunostimulatory properties of CpG motifs which when used as an adjuvant have been shown to significantly prolong the protection induced by anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) protein arrays were used to assess the immunosignature of mice vaccinated with killed F. tularensis LVS adjuvanted with immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMS) and CpG. advances in \u201comic\u201d technology have assisted with the identification of candidate T-cell antigens. NGS technology can be applied to both DNA (DNA-seq) and RNA (after conversion to cDNA-RNA-seq) RNA-seq analysis aims to identify the transcriptome (the complete set of transcripts of the cell, which includes mRNA, noncoding RNAs, and small RNAs) RNA-seq has been used to investigate host response to different virulent strains of B. melitensis in mouse macrophages. a live attenuated vaccine strain (M5-90) had a reduced ability to avoid phagosome-lysosome fusion and activate MAPK pathways. this may account for the difference in the ability of the two strains to survive in the host [74] dual RNA-seq has been used to evaluate the immune response following smallpox vaccination. PBMCs taken from Dryvax vaccinated individuals were either stimulated with or without live Vaccinia virus for 8 hours. studies on the immune repertoire have used techniques that either provide a limited description or sample a limited number of sequences. the high-throughput nature of NGS technology allows simultaneous analysis of potentially the entire immune repertoire in a single experiment. DNA microarrays have revolutionized our understanding of the host gene expression changes in response to infection with various pathogens. this information has been obtained from in vitro infection experiments. a successful example of this has been applied to the ferret model of influenza. monkeypox virus downregulates or silences genes so that the host is less responsive to infection. microarray studies performed with various biodefence agents. melitensis Gene expression analysis of mucosal epithelial cells following infection in vitro. 10K human ESTs microarray (Microarray centre, Ontario, Canada).

Vaccines Anthrax vaccine adjuvant CpG ODN Measure gene expression changes in mice and splenocytes treated with CpG ODN. Francisella tularensis LVS Assess the memory response of PBMCs taken from LVS vaccinated and nave humans. studies on human peripheral monocytes revealed that anthrax lethal toxin targets multiple normal immune-regulatory pathways that would be expected to protect the host against anthrax infection. they hypothesised that the increase in RGS14 levels and decrease in CCR5 along with IL-1R2 impairs monocyte function. protein microarrays is a more recent technology, providing a platform for high-throughput proteomics. construction is similar to DNA microarrays, except that the immobilised species is a protein or a peptide. the selected antigens demonstrated moderate specificity for recognizing Q-fever in patient sera [38] the use of protein microarrays has aided the identification of different IgG and IgM profiles for differentiating acute and chronic Q-fever [37] and a proof-of-concept diagnostic assay (immunostrip) to distinguish the two disease states. a limited number of studies have been performed using DNA microarrays to understand the protective mechanisms of licensed or novel biodefence vaccines. DNA arrays have been used to examine the immunostimulatory properties of CpG motifs which when used as an adjuvant have been shown to significantly prolong the protection induced by anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) membrane and 3 nonmembrane antigens from the intracellular mature virion were evaluated in an ELISA format with sera from MVA and DryVax vaccinees. protein arrays were used to assess the immunosignature of mice vaccinated with killed F. tularensis LVS adjuvanted with immune stimulating complexes. new arrays have been constructed using cross-species hybridisation bioinformatics to create probes to unsequenced genes. new arrays have been constructed using cross-species hybridisation bioinformatics to create probes to unsequenced genes. 89.08% in MK2 cells underwent downregulation by 1.5-fold changes or more [21] following infection with monkeypox virus. et al. (2013) also found major unresponsiveness of HeLa cells after exposure. [8] Bacillus anthracis Murine macrophage gene expression changes following exposure to protective antigen and lethal factor from B. anthracis. gene expression profiling of human macrophages following infection in vitro. protein microarray containing 93% of C. burnetii. human sera from Q-fever patients. gene expression of human monocytes infected in vitro with F. tularensis. gene expression changes in vitro 3 and 7 hours post-challenge with monkeypox virus. yersinia pestis Gene expression changes following infection in vitro. human nylon blots (1185 cDNA spots) (Clontech) gene signatures have been determined in different organs following infection with burkholderia pseudomallei [23, 24], Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Francisella tularensis [27\u201330] some microarray studies have been performed using nonhuman primates. the mRNA profiles of NHPs infected with monkeypox virus and B. anthracis are currently underway. studies on C. burnetii, the etiological agent of Q-fever, have helped to identify new diagnostic antigens [36, 38, 45] seven C. burnetii proteins (GroEL, YbgF, RplL, Mip, OmpH, Com1 and Dnak) were identified (from protein arrays studies) and then fabricated on a small array. microarray analysis showed that the overall circulating immune response in NHPs was similar both in the presence and absence of coagulation inhibitors. however, the profiles of the surviving NHPs in the treated groups clustered together. chemokine ligand 8 (CCL8/MCP-2) and coagulation-associated genes TFPI and PDPN correlated with survival. antibody profile evoked by smallpox vaccines has been examined. follows development of a Vaccinia proteome microarray by Davies et al. in 2005. next generation sequencing (NGS; also known as high-throughput, short-read, or deep sequencing) has revolutionised sequence-based analyses over the last decade. it uses micro-/nanotechnologies to run millions or billions of parallel sequencing reactions. read lengths are typically comparatively short, a result of which is that any particular base is sequenced many times. RNA-seq has been used to study host response to pathogens. a live attenuated vaccine strain (M5-90) had reduced ability to avoid phagosome-lysosome fusion and activate MAPK pathways when compared with the virulent strain M28. a second study examining microRNA profile of RAW264.7 cells in response to B. melitensis infection also used a high throughput sequencing approach. a significant amount of previously uncharacterised gene isoforms and alternative transcripts over a range of pathways were shown. a greater number of host differentially regulated transcripts upon infection by an attenuated DENV strain than by the wild-type. this suggests that there may be a previously uncharacterised innate immune response which is largely evaded in wild-type strains. chemokines, cytokines, interferons, and macrophage-associated genes exhibited downregulation upon infection while there was an upregulation of histones, IFN, IFN, and heat shock proteins. the immunological repertoire is a term defining the collection of surface-expressed B-cell (BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs) sRNA expression of Yersinia pestis grown in vitro and in the mouse lung. deep sequencing provided a more sensitive and comprehensive unbiased coverage of the host transcriptome. a live attenuated vaccine strain (M5-90) had a reduced ability to avoid phagosome-lysosome fusion and activate MAPK pathways. this may account for the difference in the ability of the two strains to survive in the host [74] a subset of immune-related transcripts was uniquely induced by Francisella. a classical inflammatory response was activated in the lungs of mice 24 hours after infection. a number of chemokines, cytokines, interferons, and macrophage-associated genes exhibited downregulation upon infection. the high-throughput nature of NGS technology allows simultaneous analysis of potentially the entire immune repertoire in a single experiment [84\u201386] there is clearly scope to apply this technique to monitor the immune repertoire in response to other infectious diseases, vaccines, or therapeutics. fluorescence-based proliferation assays are also available to assess levels of soluble factors including cytokines in samples from in vitro and ex vivo tissues. intracellular cytokine responses can also be measured by intracellular staining, with fluorochrome labelled antibodies, to determine cellular phenotypes generated following vaccination or therapeutic treatment with specific antigens. y. pestis virulence plasmid pYV was shown to be involved in this evasion of early inflammatory responses in the skin. the role of neutrophils in burkholderia infection in the murine host also aligns with human ex vivo studies where phagocytosis and apoptosis of B. pseudomallei were impaired. Flow cytometry bead-based assays have the potential to aid our understanding of potential protective mechanisms of novel immunotherapeutics. they have been used in studies investigating the effects of IFN- therapy in mice during B. pseudomallei infection [103] potential immune correlates of protection have also been identified in studies by comparing profiles of lymphocyte populations following vaccination (prior to infection) and their responses during infection with Monkeypox virus [110]. flow cytometry in follow-on studies of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) vaccination has also been greatly aided by flow cytometry. fluorescence microscopy is being investigated for its utility in the diagnosis of infections including B. pseudomallei. fluorescence microscopy can provide a much more detailed assessment of how pathogens interact with host cells. fluorescence microscopy has enabled us to understand the intracellular nature and niches of pathogens. fluorescence microscopy has also been used to understand the role of complement in uptake of F. tularensis into cells and the immune evasion of this pathway by F. tularensis. the interaction of B. mallei and other bacteria with host cells has been assessed using fluorescence microscopy in in vitro studies. inducing alternative autophagic pathways using novel inducer AR-12 reduced bacterial growth in F. tularensis infection [112]. the dynamics between vacuoles, lysosomes, and processes which regulate actin dynamics in formation of vacuoles have been investigated in detail using C. burnetii mutants. this has led to identification of host targets with the potential for therapeutic targeting. fluorescence microscopy and an m-cherry red strain of B. melitensis identified bacteria associated with host cells in tissue sections from in vivo infection models. this study showed the in situ colocalisation of B. melitensis with a number of different cellular phenotypes within granulomas in the spleen and liver. biphotonic imaging (BPI) has enabled new insights into pathogen dissemination, host responses to infection, interactions between host and pathogen, and the effects of antimicrobials and vaccines. the creation of BL or FL strains of pathogenic organisms has enabled this field to progress and description of the processes involved in BPI. i.n. challenge with BL Y. pestis leads to a detectable BL signal [143, 145] in the upper abdominal region which was confirmed to originate from the lung by ex vivo imaging of tissues. the pattern of dissemination of BL strains of F. tularensis type A and type B (LVS) has been investigated. BL expressing B. anthracis strains modified to express only one of the anthrax toxins stimulated different patterns of early immune response after cutaneous infection of the ear pinna [153]. BL expressing B. anthracis strains modified to express only one of the anthrax toxins stimulated different patterns of early immune response. imaging flow cytometry has the ability to further advance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. it is particularly suitable for assessing colocalisation of pathogens within host cells and for examining cellular processes for uptake and processing of pathogens. a composite (overlayed) fluorescence image shows intracellular Bps inside neutrophils (Ly6G/Bps) each image series shows 6 representative cells from one sample. other imaging technologies include positron emission tomography (PET) and computer tomography. intracellular staining with fluorochrome labelled antibodies allows the presence of intracellular bacteria within host cells. fluorescent labelling of pathogens has allowed the location of pathogens within host cells to be identified in both in vitro and in vivo infection studies using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. y. pestis virulence plasmid pYV was shown to be involved in this evasion of early inflammatory responses in the skin. neutrophils were found to be crucial for protection in both respiratory and intraperitoneal forms of these related infections. Flow cytometry bead-based assays have the potential to aid our understanding of potential protective mechanisms of novel immunotherapeutics by assessing cytokine responses. these assays have been used in studies investigating the effects of IFN- therapy in mice during B. pseudomallei infection. studies by comparing profiles of lymphocyte populations following vaccination (prior to infection) and their responses during infection with Monkeypox virus. flow cytometry aided the identification of putative vaccine candidates [112] and the longevity of immune responses to vaccines. fluorescent-activated cell sorting and cDNA technologies have recently been used together to generate antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. flow cytometry has highlighted a key role for various cell types in murine infection models of Y. pestis, the causative agent of plague. the role of neutrophils in burkholderia infection in the murine host also aligns with human ex vivo studies. phagocytosis and apoptosis of B. pseudomallei by human blood neutrophils were impaired in diabetic patients. this impaired neutrophil function may contribute to increased susceptibility to burkholderia infection observed in diabetic patients. assays have been used in studies investigating the effects of IFN- therapy in mice during B. pseudomallei infection. they have also been used to further our understanding of the protective immune responses involved following a combination of preexposure vaccination and postexposure CpG immunotherapy against B. pseudomallei infection in vivo. flow cytometry aided the longevity of immune responses to vaccines. a number of memory cell phenotypes were investigated, but flow cytometry lacked the sensitivity to detect changes in immune profiles between vaccinated and placebo groups. the role of antigen-presenting cells in generating protective immunity during vaccination to B. pseudomallei and F. tularensis LVS [107] has also been greatly aided by the use of flow cytometry techniques. fluorescence microscopy is being investigated for its utility in the diagnosis of infections including B. pseudomallei. confocal microscopy, intravital 2-photon microscopy, dynamic live cell imaging, and super resolution microscopy have been used to interrogate host-pathogen interactions. fluorescence microscopy has the potential to elucidate host pathway targets. the interaction of F. tularensis and B. pseudomallei with pathways of autophagic digestion has been assessed using in vitro studies. scopy has been utilised to develop a high content imaging assay to understand the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) during B. pseudomallei infection. this quantitative method allowed the effect of bacterial mutants, thought to subvert the formation of MNGCs, to be assessed. this method was also used to investigate the effect of small molecule inhibitors on MNGC formation. therapies to the Y. pestis bacterium using immunofluorescence demonstrated the specificity of potential therapies for bubonic plague. intraavital microscopy was used to identify the rapidity of the neutrophil response in situ during intradermal infection with ds-red expressing Y. pestis strain. this led the authors to investigate the role of neutrophils in dissemination of plague to the lymph nodes. understanding of the interactions of F. tularensis and other bacteria with host cells has contributed to development of treatment regimens. fluorescence microscopy also has the potential to elucidate host pathway targets which could be therapeutically manipulated to prevent evasion of the host response by bacteria. Confocal microscopy has also been utilised to develop a high content imaging assay to understand the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) during B. pseudomallei infection. this quantitative method allowed the effect of bacterial mutants, thought to subvert the formation of MNGCs, to be assessed. this method also allowed the effect of small molecule inhibitors on MNGC formation. monoclonal antibody therapies to the Y. pestis bacterium demonstrated the specificity of any protection observed in in vivo studies. intraavital microscopy was used to identify the rapidity of the neutrophil response in situ during intradermal infection with ds-red expressing Y. pestis strain. the creation of BL or FL strains of pathogenic organisms has enabled this field to progress and description of the processes involved in BPI. different patterns of pathogen dissemination can be readily observed allowing discrimination of the growth and spread of different forms of the pathogen or target organs. the pattern of dissemination of BL B. pseudomallei following inhalational challenge has been investigated. the spread of both wild type and capsule mutant strains of B. pseudomallei has been compared with an immunocompentent, hairless SKH-1 mouse strain. effect of immunisation with protective antigen (PA) vaccine immunisation on anthrax spore germination and bacterial spread has also been assessed. BL expressing B. anthracis strains modified to express only one of the anthrax toxins stimulated different patterns of early immune response. the number of publications which incorporate use of ImagestreamX for investigating host-pathogen interactions is growing each year. no studies for biodefence pathogens have been published. pathogens which have been used to model biodefence pathogens have been documented [158] demonstrating the potential of this technology. other imaging technologies have been used clinically in the diagnosis of infectious diseases including anthrax and tuberculosis. some of these technologies have been used in biodefence research, for example, positron emission tomography (PET)/computer tomography (CT) imaging was used to examine inflammation patterns in Monkeypox virus infection of primates [159] model biodefence pathogens, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis as a model for Yersinia pestis, have been documented [158] demonstrating the potential of this technology. this technique has the potential of providing a high-throughput imaging technique for the analysis of host-pathogen interactions. the use of imaging technologies in high containment has the potential to provide a multi-faceted approach to imaging to further enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of infection with biodefence agents in the future. the use of other imaging technologies and their potential application to biodefence agents in the clinic is reviewed in [160]."}
