{"summary": "the P. pastoris system is much easier to perform and cheaper in cost compared with bacterial expression systems. recombinant protein subunit vaccines are significantly more secure than live attenuated and inactivated/killed vaccines. the P. pastoris system is licensed to more than 160 companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, vaccine and food industries. the system is widely accepted as safe and suitable for human use. the AOX1 promoter (PAOX1) is repressed by glucose, glycerol or ethanol. it is strongly induced by methanol, making P. pastoris a relatively tightly controlled expression system. alternative inducible or constitutive promoters have been used in the production of recombinant proteins. the optimal clone containing multiple copies of the target gene must be determined. copy number can be assessed through colony screening using enhanced concentrations of antibiotic or real-time PCR. the development of recombinant protein subunit vaccines depends on which viral antigens induce protective immunity in response to infection. the ability to produce large amounts of viral antigens for vaccine manufacture is important for subunit vaccine development. the large-scale production of antigens for industrial purposes has been enabled by recombinant DNA technology. VLPs are a potentially safe subunit vaccine that can induce immune responses similar to those prompted by natural viral infection. it has been found that VLPs are more stable and considerably more immunogenic than purified protein antigens. at present, some VLPs vaccines have been licensed and commercialized. the clinical evaluation involves studies of effects of vaccine candidates on healthy volunteers for immunogenicity, efficacy and safety. the use of Pichia pastoris in recombinant subunit vaccine development E. coli is widely used in both commercial (for the generation of approximately 30% of biopharmaceutical products) 63 Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) 210.53 S Recombinant E1GA (codons 390\u2013641) induced both humoral and cellular immune responses 65 Dengue virus (DENV-3) envelope domain-III (EDIII) 187 S The purified EDIII antigen could efficiently induce neutralizing antibodies 68 Avian influenza virus (H5N1) neuraminidase (NA) 2 S Recombinant E protein could induce protective the viral glycoprotein gp350 is an attractive candidate for a prophylactic vaccine. the secretory form of truncated gp350 (gp3501-443, codons 1-443) has the potential to be developed into EBV subunit vaccine. the purified EDIII antigen could induce neutralizing antibodies. the strategy described in this study enabled fulfilling the mounting demand for recombinant EDIII. the outbreak of the avian influenza had brought a serious threat to public health. P. pastoris-produced DENV-3 envelope-based VLPs preserved the antigenic integrity of the major neutralizing epitopes. HPV L1 major capsid protein self-assembles into VLPs when expressed heterologously. the commercial HPV vaccines are expensive and still inaccessible to the majority of the population. 81 Approximately 50 mg HBsAg VLPs with a purity of greater than 99% was obtained from 1 L culture broth. HBsAg-based VLPs could elicit significantly high HBsAg-specific IgG titers as well as strong cellular immune responses. recombinant proteins are efficiently secreted into the medium, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention during high-level production can be a problem. the ER contains several chaperones and foldases such as the hsp70 member Kar2/Bip. many protease-deficient yeast strains (SMD163, SMD165 and SMD168) have been developed. genetic engineering on P. pastoris has been utilized to optimize the host-cell background in order to produce proteins with proper post-translational modifications. P. pastoris is one of the powerful and popular systems for the production of recombinant proteins of commercial interest. it offers various advantages as a host system including stable expression, high-level production, low cost and ease of genetic manipulation."}
