{"summary": "human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs or hIgGs) have been widely used to treat several human diseases, such as autoimmunity, immunodeficiency and infection. in the case of a medical emergency, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks or the most recent outbreak of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, hIgGs have been shown to be a life saving measure. hIgG/bIg accounted for about 70% and hIgG/bIg accounted for about 10% of the total hIgGs. fully hIgG only accounted for about 20% of the total hIgGs. cloning of triple KO (TKO, IGHM/IGHML1/IGL/) Tc cattle by chromatin transfer. inactivation of the bIGL by deleting the bIGL gene cluster greatly improved fully hIgGs production in the sera of Tc cattle, with an average of 51.3% fully hIgG. two bIGH loci, IGHM and IGHML, and the bIGL locus, IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, were to be homozygously inactivated. it would take four rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to KO the IGHM and IGHML loci. another four rounds to KO the bIGL locus, entailing eight rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning in total. chromosomal localization dictates that the IGHM and IGHML1 loci segregate together during meiosis. chromosome engineering strategy includes pedigree and deduced structure of bovine chromosomes for knockouts. male cell line 6939 and female cell line 3427 were sequentially targeted to obtain G0 TKO cell lines. for males, we selected a Holstein fetal primary fibroblast cell line (6939) and sequentially knocked out both of the IGHML1 alleles. for females, we used a primary fetal primary fibroblast cell line (6939) and sequentially knocked out both of the IGHML1 alleles. for females, we selected a Holstein fetal primary fibroblast cell line (6939) and established IGHM / we then produced calves from both the male IGHM /+ IGHML1 / and female IGHM / cell lines by CT. as one of the IGHM alleles in the males and two of IGHML1 alleles in the females were intact, the resulting animals were immunologically competent. we first isolated and characterized a bovine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA sequence from this gene cluster. by screening a BAC genomic library with probes specific to the bovine immunoglobulin lambda constant region sequences. we isolated a positive BAC clone and subjected it to shotgun sequencing. compared to the report by Chen, L et al. where four IGLJ-IGLC genes were identified in the bovine [6], we identified five IGLJ-IGLC genes based on our sequence data. we concluded that this is a distinct IGLJ-IGLC gene from IGLJ2-IGLC2 and defined it as IGLJ3-IGLC3. this gene is located about 4 kb downstream of IGLJ2-IGLC2. Southern blot analysis of bovine genomic DNA for the analysis of IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster including deduced restriction fragments. the most significant difference in the fragment is the presence or absence of 6.3 kb EcoRI fragments based on the sequence data of 141C2 and DQ587487. the plasmid pC1CAGzeoPuroloxPDT is the first KO vector to place a loxP site 5\u2032 outside of the J1 domain. the plasmid pC5CAGloxPneoDT is the first KO vector to place a loxP site 5\u2032 outside of the J1 domain. the plasmid pC5CAGloxPneoDT is a second KO vector allowing placement of another bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletions were performed in a male cell line, J481 (IGHM / IGHML1 /+), and in a female cell line, H412 (IGHM / IGHML1 /+), which were established above. for distinguishing the bIGL alleles in these two cell lines, we designated the bIGL alleles in J481 as A and D, and those in H412 as B and C colony #27 was positive for the nucleotide G (specific to allele D) but negative for nucleotide T (specific to allele A) in the SNPs region. we then subjected colony #27 to embryonic cloning to generate 40d fetuses. all five cells were confirmed to have the genotype IGHM / IGHML1 /+ IGLC1 loxP. allele A was specifically knocked out while Colony #22 showed only \"T\" integration of another loxP sequence located 3\u2032 outside the C5 domain was confirmed by genomic PCR, CL5CAG-F2F2. reconstitution of CAG promoter-driven puro gene caused by the cluster deletion was also confirmed by genomic PCR, CAGpuro-F3R3. 21 colonies were subjected to genomic PCR screening by using two pairs of PCR primers, CL5CAG-F2/CL5CAG-R2 and CAGpuro-F3/CAGpuro-R3. all of the 21 colonies were confirmed to carry the desired bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products. male Fetal Cell line ID Recipients implanted Pregnant 40d (%) Fetus collected at 40d Pregnant 180d (%) Calf ID used for breeding G054 39 16 (41) 0 9 (23) 4 (10) 522 W612-1 30 11 (37) 0 10 (33) 4 (13) 526, 528 In parallel, we employed the same two-step bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion strategy described above in the female cell line H412. we chose one cell line, Y927-1, conducted CT and produced IGHM / IGHML1 /+ IGLJC1 loxP/+ genotype. we used the same co-transfection strategy used in the male cell line to integrate the second loxP sequence at a position 3\u2032 of the bIGLJ5-IGLC5 gene. for the establishment of female IGHM / IGHML1 /+ IGL /+ calves, we employed an additional round of cluster deletion using another female IGHM / IGHML1 /+ cell line, J746. we inserted the loxP sequence at 3\u2032 of IGLJ5-IGLC5 using pC5(B)CAGloxPneoDT and established an IGHM / IGHML1 /+ IGLJC1 lox two of these fetuses were identified as female and three as male using Y-chromosome-specific genomic PCR. cKSL-HAC/DKO Tc cattle produce physiological levels of hIgG. previously engineered a new version of cKSL-HAC. the majority of pregnancy at 40d were maintained (126 out of 151) and 37 live Tc calves were born. the majority of pregnancy at 40d were maintained (126 out of 151) and the majority of pregnancy at 40d were maintained. cKSL-HAC/TKO fibroblast fetal cells were transferred to the TKO cell line E024A-2). embryos were transferred to 32 recipient cows for each cell lines and five live calves each were produced. deletion of the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster resulted in a complete elimination of bovine lambda light-chain gene expression. the percentages of hIgM/hIg (or hIgM/bIg)-double positive B cells slightly increased in cKSL-HAC/TKO Tc cattle over the DKO Tc cattle. the percentage of hIgG/hIg-double positive B cells in cKSL-HAC/TKO cattle were lower than those in cKSL-HAC/TKO. the average levels of total hIgG were comparable or slightly lower in the sera of cKSL-HAC/TKO Tc calves than those from cKSL-HAC/DKO Tc calves. the percentages of fully hIgG drastically increased in TKO Tc calves over the DKO Tc calves. we achieved our goal of significantly improving fully hIgG production by inactivating the bIGL locus. sequential gene targeting strategy is to use embryonic cloning by CT to rejuvenate the genetically modified cells following each round of gene targeting. this strategy overcomes the limitation set by the cellular senesce program in cultured somatic cells and allows one to sequentially modify the genome of somatic cells as many rounds as one wishes. cumulative epigenetic errors can be introduced into the (re)cloned cells at each round of embryonic cloning, which in turn severely compromises the developmental competence of the bIGHM, IGHML1 and IGL loci were mapped on bovine chromosome 11 (bChr11) both of these loci are located on bChr21 (our unpublished data) chromosome engineering strategy includes pedigree and deduced structure of bovine chromosomes for knockouts is shown. 0 IGHM / IGHML1 /+ cell lines were subjected to the cluster deletion. BAC clone 227-A16 contained part of the IGH variable region and the IGHML1 through the C1 region. the size of the three BAC clones contiguously is estimated to be around 380 kb. pBCNKOneo for AY, pBCKOpuro for u, and pBCKOpuro for u. fetuses were bred using superovulation followed by artificial insemination. fetuses were collected at 40 days (40d of gestation) of gestation. seven fetuses (7/18, 39%) were confirmed to be the IGHM / IGHML1 /+ genotype. the rest were the IGHM /+ IGHML1 /+ genotype. both of the IGHM and IGHML1 loci are located on the bChr21. GLJ-IGLC gene cluster composed of the five IGLJ-IGLC genes (IGLJ1-IGLC1 through IGLJ5-IGLC5) appeared to be functional genes as judged by their uninterrupted reading frames coding for functional proteins. both the IGLJ1-IGLC1 and IGLJ5-IGLC5 genes contain immature stop codon mutations. the number of IGLJ gene unites in the bIGL locus is likely attributed to the fact that the coding sequences of IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3 exons are identical and were not detected as distinct gene units by Chen L et al. however, our interpretation of the structure of the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster was further supported by Southern blot data we produced from analyzing the genomic DNA isolated from fibroblast cells derived both from Hol gl II, EcoRI, Hind III, and Pst I stained with the probe that was prepared based on bovine IGLC sequence (GenBank AF396698) the expected sizes of fragments are listed in the upper and lower table based on the 141C2 and DQ587487 sequences. the bIGL locus contains multiple functional IGLJ-IGLC gene units as described above. the plasmid pC1CAGzeoPuroloxPDT is the first KO vector to place a loxP site 5\u2032 outside of the J1 domain. it is composed of 9.9 kb and 3.1 kb genomic DNA as a long and short arm. the second KO vector is co-transfected with Cre-expression plasmid to bring about the cluster deletion. cells where the cluster deletion occurred can be selected by puromycin. to delete the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster in the J481 cell line, we first transfected cells with the allele A-specific KI vector, pC1(A)CAGzeoPuroloxPDT, to integrate the loxP sequence at a position 5\u2032 of the bIGLJ-IGLC1 gene. after selection of transfected cells with zeocin, the zeocin-resistant cell colonies were screened for the desired the occurrence of homologous recombination was confirmed by genomic PCR, CL1puro-F2F2 x R-R1. negative PCR, R-F2 x R-R1, was done to double check the homologous recombination because it can only be amplified from the wild type allele. a position 3\u2032 of the bIGLJ5-IGLC5 gene and to induce chromosome recombination between these two integrated loxP sequences to delete the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster via Cre-expression. we tested whether co-transfection of K655-1 cells with the second loxP KI vector and Cre-expression plasmids together was effective. we chose cell lines G054 and W612-1 based on preferable epigenetic profiles. we performed embryo transfer and transferred 69 cloned embryos to recipient cows. twenty-seven pregnancies were detected at 40d, and eight live calves were produced. 16 of 202 screened zeocin-resistant colonies were confirmed to be correctly targeted. a pair of PCR primers (R-R1 x R-F2) flank the SNPs distinguishing the B and C alleles. we identified five colonies targeted to the B-allele as they were positive for nucleotide G (specific to allele C) but negative for nucleotide T (specific to allele B) in the SNPs region. pair of PCR primers, CL5CAG-F2/CL5CAG-R2 and CAGpuro-F3/CAGpuro-R3 followed by sequencing of the PCR products which led to the identification of 6 colonies carrying the desired bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion. subsequently established multiple 40d cell lines (G2) from some of these positive colonies by embryonic cloning. female IGHM / IGHML1 /+ IGL /+ calf 1768 was established through CT. male (522, 526 and 528) and female (1768, 1804, 1805, 1806 and 1820) cattle were raised to sexual maturity and crossbred. at 40d gestation, 58 fetuses were collected and genotyped. hIgM constant domain was replaced by bovine IgM constant domain. this new version of HAC also dramatically improved B cell development in the DKO Tc cattle. majority of pregnancy at 40d were maintained (126 out of 151) and 37 live Tc calves were born. cKSL-HAC/TKO fetal cell lines (R788 and V524) were established as chromatin donors by CT. embryos were transferred to 32 recipient cows for each cell lines and five live calves each were produced. RT-PCR analysis on blood cells isolated from the newborn calves demonstrated that deletion of the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster resulted in a complete elimination of bovine lambda. bIgL-Ld-F1x bIgL-C-R and L003-F2 x L004-R2 were used to amplify VJ-rearranged bIGK gene. the primer pair, bIg-FR, was used to amplify VJ-rearranged bIGK gene. N, negative control; P, positive control. KO Tc cattle were lower than those in cKSL-HAC/DKO. for IgM detection, anti-hIgM antibody was used. from left to right panels, PBMCs were stained with IgM alone, IgM/bCD21, IgM/b, IgM/b and IgM/h antibodies. n = number of animals analyzed for each genotype. red lines represent arithmetic mean for each genotype in total hIgG (g/l), fully hIgG (hIgG/h plus hIgG/hIg) (g/l), and serum fully hIgG (hIgG/h plus hIgG/hIg) over total hIgG (%). the bovine immunoglobulin gene function was reconstituted by a HAC. we demonstrated that DKO Tc cattle produce physiological level of hIgGs. however, as the bovine endogenous immunoglobulin light-chain genes are intact in these Tc cattle, the majority of hIgGs produced were chimeric. we decided to inactivate the bIGL locus by deleting the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster. the size has been previously estimated to be 18.6 kb. this was the first demonstration of this application of the Cre/loxP system in any mammalian species. deletion requires two rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning. induction of IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion requires another round of gene targeting and embryonic cloning. to reduce the rounds of embryonic cloning, we co-transfected the second loxP KI vector with the Cre expression vector. this is the highest fully hIgG production in any transgenic animal systems reported so far [14]. this is the highest fully hIgG production in any transgenic animal systems reported so far [14]. this study is of great significance as this Tc bovine system has made using genetically engineered animals for large quantities of fully hIgGs production a reality towards providing a safe and reliable alternative to human plasma derived hIgG. pathogen-specific fully human antibodies produced from hyper-immunized Tc cattle are highly effective in neutralizing target antigens both in vitro and in vivo. the research includes the development of proprietary immunogen formulation and immunization protocols to hyper-immunize the Tc cattle. all protocols and procedures used in the Animal Care and Use Program were reviewed by the IACUC for appropriate management practices. analgesic, anesthetics and tranquillizing drugs were used when appropriate under supervision of Veterinary Services. cattle were not restrained for more than four hours per day. a film (Kodak Safety Film AR, Kodak) was exposed for 5 days with an intensifying screen at 80\u00b0C. construction of gene targeting vectors, pbCAYKObsr for 10AY, pBCNKOneo for U, and pBCKOpuro for u, were described previously. gene targeting vector pC5CAGloxPneoDT A 10 kb Sac II-Nsi I genomic fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(-)vector. the CAGzeo/loxP/polyA/neo cassette was inserted at Hin dIII site present in the genomic fragment. all the PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gels. all the PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gels. the animal protocols contained in the study were approved by the IACUC. care of all vertebrate animals was subject to regular review by the IACUC. daily observations were made by herdsmen to ensure appropriate standards of animal care were being met. Approximately 20 g genomic DNA digested with BamHI, Bgl II, EcoRI, HindIII and Pst I were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. the separated DNA were transferred to positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham) after depurination with 0.25N HCl for 15 minutes twice, neutralization in 0.25N NaOH/1.5M NaCl solution for 15 minutes twice, washed in 1M Tris-C us screened the lambda phage library with 32P labeled BC-f2/BC-r2 PCR product as the probe and identified multiple positive phage clones. we then subcloned a Sal I fragment (about 17 kb) isolated from a lambda clone (#7) into the Sal I site of pBluescript II SK(-) we then subcloned a Sal I fragment (about 17 kb) into the Sal I site of pBluescript II SK(-) plasmid. from this plasmid, a 9.8 kb BamHI fragment was further cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK(-). DT-A gene was inserted at Not I site. construction of gene targeting vector pC1CAGzeoPuroloxPDT A 13 kb Nde I-Hin dIII genomic fragment isolated from a lambda phage clone was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(-)vector. the DT-A gene was inserted at Not I site. this vector was constructed from the alleles A and B genomic fragment derived from lambda phage clones. MMCT was done with each HAC vector as described previously [5]. Genomic PCR and RT-PCR analyses These analyses were implemented as previously described [5]. all the PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gels. oned fetuses and calves were produced using chromatin transfer procedure described previously. intron DNA sequence alignment between the bovine IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3 genes corresponds to intronic sequence of the IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3 genes. female IGM/IGML1/+IGL/+ calves 1768, 1804, 1805, 1806 and 1820 were used for the second breeding to generate five TKO fetal cell lines. bovine IGLJ1-IGLC1 is located at 9480-9517 and 10791-11110."}
