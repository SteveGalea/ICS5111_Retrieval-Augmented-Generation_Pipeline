{"summary": "the inflammatory response to the virus promotes hepatic fibrosis and development of cirrhosis. graft cirrhosis occurs universally and is associated with an aggressive course in a proportion of patients within 3\u20135 years. the 5-year survival of HCV-positive recipients is overall significantly lower than that of HCV-negative patients. ing and high-throughput protein analysis has provided opportunities for rapid and accurate characterization of gene expression in tissues. biomarkers to predict anti-viral treatment response would provide important diagnostic reagents in the management of HCV. innate and adaptive immune responses are important for viral clearance. CD8+ T cells appear to have lost most of their ability to proliferate and produce cytokines. in the absence of pre-existing defects in adaptive immunity, such as immunosuppression associated with malnutrition, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection or renal failure, this CD8+ T cell dysfunction has been attributed to high levels of persistent viral antigens. the immune system employs Treg cells to maintain self-tolerance by suppressing the activation and expansion of self-reactive lymphocytes. a controlled balance between initiation and down-regulation of the host immune response is vital in maintenance of immune homeostasis. the fgl2 gene encodes a protein of 432 amino acids in mice and 439 amino acids in humans. the deduced protein sequence contains a predicted signal peptide, five N-linked glycosylation sites, and conserved cysteine residues. the fgl2 gene was first cloned from cytotoxic T lymphocytes. the 229-amino-acid-long carboxyl-terminus consists of a highly conserved globular domain, known as the fibrinogen-related domain (FRED), that is characteristic of the fibrinogen-related protein superfamily. the overall identity between the mouse and human FGL2 is 78%, but within the FRED domain the two proteins share 90% homology. the regulatory activity of FGL2 has been implicated in inhibition of allograft rejection39 and autoimmunity. the exact role of the membrane-associated FGL2 remains undefined. other members of the fibrinogen-related superfamily have previously been shown to have immunoregulatory activity. the role of FGL2 in regulation of adaptive immune responses was first shown by Chan et al.,47 who studied the molecular and functional properties of the protein in vitro. the role of FGL2 in regulation of adaptive immune responses was first shown by Chan et al.,47 who studied the molecular and functional properties of the protein. herman et al. were the first to report increased transcripts of fgl2 in Treg cells isolated from the pancreas of diabetic mice. fgl2 expression was observed in Treg cells from IL-2/ mice that were treated with recombinant IL-2 for 24 hours. in fgl2/ mice, an increased number and percentage of Treg cells were found with a greater expression of Foxp3 compared with fgl2+/+ Treg cells. however, the suppressive activity of fgl2+/+ Treg cells was significantly impaired. resistant mice fail to produce FGL2 following MHV-3 infection either in vivo or in vitro. surviving mice that express only moderate levels of FGL2 develop chronic hepatitis. resistant mice expressed markedly elevated levels of sFGL2 over time, correlating with increased numbers of Treg cells. however, adoptive transfer of fgl2+/+ Treg cells into resistant fgl2/ mice increased their mortality following MHV-3 infection. these data collectively suggest disturbances in Treg cell activity or number may be important in the pathogenesis of viral induced liver injury. plasma levels of sFGL2 were significantly higher in patients with chronic HCV infection (84.3 89.1 ng/mL, n = 80) compared to healthy controls (36.41 21.9 ng/mL, n = 30), patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (18.8 17.4 ng/mL, n = 24) initiation of therapy, >300 ng/mL, remained high throughout treatment and at 6 months post-treatment. sFGL2 levels fell within 4 weeks of therapy to levels seen in healthy controls. sFGL2 levels in patients with chronic HCV infection were low prior to initiation of treatment. increased expression of FGL2 in the explanted liver correlates with severity and recurrence of HCV infection. a chronic HCV patient with many FGL2-positive cells (brown cells) in the explant developed aggressive recurrent disease that did not respond to treatment. GL2 down-regulates immune activation of DC as indicated by inhibition of expression of maturation markers CD80, CD86, and MHCII. this suppressive effect of FGL2 on DC was shown to be mediated by inhibition of NF-B nuclear translocation. inhibition of FGL2 improves outcomes to experimental hepatitis. reagents that interfere with FGL2 may have even broader applicability."}
