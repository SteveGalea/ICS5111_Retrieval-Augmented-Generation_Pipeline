{"summary": "new pandemic plans should wait for leadership if national plans are not to diverge. the only predictable characteristic of influenza viruses and pandemics is their unpredictability [1]. this pandemic, sometimes described as \u201cmild to moderate,\u201d was not limited to only mild or moderate illness. many patients were severely ill and died, and undoubtedly, high-quality clinical management of patients with severe complications in intensive care units saved many lives of the critically ill. young people have been disproportionately affected in terms of hospitalisation and deaths compared to seasonal influenza in which complications and mortality are predominantly borne by the elderly. the risk to pregnant women has been higher than for seasonal influenza in which complications and mortality are predominantly borne by the elderly. first pandemic to occur after major global investments in pandemic preparedness had been initiated. first pandemic to coincide with ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic. first pandemic with early diagnostic tests that led to rapid diagnosis. first pandemic in which intensive care was available in many countries. first pandemic to occur after major global investments in pandemic preparedness had been initiated. first pandemic to coincide with ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic. first pandemic with early diagnostic tests that led to rapid diagnosis. the first pandemic with a \u201cblogosphere\u201d was detected and isolated reasonably early, although too late for any attempt at containment. the best estimates of the timing of emergence are variously mid-February from field epidemiology in southeast Mexico or mid-january from a molecular clock model. the few published serosurveys revealed heterogeneities in infection rates among different groups and between different places. serological evidence of substantial preexisting humoral immunity among older adults, ranging from 23% (132 titre by haemagglutination inhibition in those 65 years or over) [14] to 34% (180 titre by microneutralisation assay in those 60 years or over) a preliminary evaluation of intensive containment undertaken in parts of the UK during its spring/summer wave of 2009 demonstrates how resource- and labour-intensive community containment could have been. it is now recognised that the phrase \u201ccontainment\u201d was unfortunate and potentially misleading since at best the actions were only mitigating impact. most countries recommended adoption of hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and early self-isolation when ill. but use of face masks in the community was uncommon except in east Asia. antivirals were successful when early treatment was administered. local decisions were made to close schools in some areas as a response to prevent transmission and high attack rates among schoolchildren. household secondary attack rates during the pandemic were similar to those with seasonal influenza [13],[29] there was much debate over whether to use conventional masks or respirators in health care settings. sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistance have been reported in association with a specific mutation (H275Y in neuraminidase) pandemic virus has remained genetically and antigenically stable so far. a pandemic vaccine was a scientific success, but limited availability until after the autumn/winter wave had nearly peaked in the northern Hemisphere contributed to lower coverage than anticipated. a single dose was immunogenic among all persons except for younger children. this reduced the required number of doses by half from the projected number needed in most countries. a vaccine was clearly justified for countries where annual vaccines for seasonal influenza are routinely recommended. the pandemic emergency committee declared the pandemic over on 10 august 2010. it is reassuring that the people entrusted with undertaking the latter task should judge the validity of the advice rendered by experts. the decision makers should also be prepared to justify their actions. a strong argument exists for making future plans more flexible. rewriting plans should best wait for leadership if national plans are not to diverge. a strong argument exists for making future plans more flexible. a pandemic strain has already been cocirculating with other interpandemic influenza virus strains in some parts of the world. greater access to antivirals and influenza vaccines worldwide is an ongoing challenge. more than 80 less-resourced countries have signed agreements with WHO."}
