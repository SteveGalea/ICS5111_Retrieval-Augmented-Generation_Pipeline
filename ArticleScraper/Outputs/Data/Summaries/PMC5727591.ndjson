{"summary": "public health England (PHE) East Midlands was alerted to 21 cases of salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium gastroenteritis, with onset in february 2015. seven cases in this initial phase of the outbreak required hospitalisation. seven cases in this initial phase of the outbreak required hospitalisation. hypothesis-generating interviews identified that several cases had eaten at the same restaurant during the incubation period for their illness. despite interventions to control the initial outbreak, cases continued to emerge followed by a prolonged period of transmission until 2016. a case\u2013control study was undertaken to understand the association between consuming restaurant food or drink and illness. cases were recruited and were requested to nominate people who had eaten with them as controls. no other criteria were set for control selection. single linkage cluster 1.1.1.124.395.395 was defined as part of the outbreak. a food trace-back investigation was conducted to identify suppliers of meat, eggs, stuffing and gravy. repeated site visits and inspections continued throughout the outbreak. testing methods were adapted for non-routine samples. Isolates from positive samples were referred to GBRU for WGS and SNP analysis allowing comparison with clinical samples. positive isolates were submitted to the PHE Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU) for serological confirmation, phage typing and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. extracted DNA from isolates was also mapped to the S. Typhimurium reference genome (GenBank: AE006468) as previously described. a food trace-back investigation was conducted to identify suppliers of meat, eggs, stuffing and gravy. a food trace-back investigation was conducted to determine if local suppliers were being used or if larger national/international suppliers had links to other reported cases or outbreaks of S. Typhimurium. repeated cycles of cleaning were undertaken at the restaurant. people not meeting case definitions with matching whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates. cases had a median age of 28 years (range: 5 months\u201385 years), 65% (53/82) were female and 99% (81/82) lived in the same county as the restaurant. multivariable analysis identified sex and recent antibiotic use, as confounders. the adjusted odds of becoming a case remained over 20 times greater after eating any carvery food (aOR: 20.9; 95% CI: 2.2 \u2013, Table 2). Effect modification was not identified between covariates in the final model. a single MLVA profile was identified (3\u201314\u20139-0\u20130211) in 34 cases (one additional case had a single locus variant) this profile had been associated with human cases and pigs in several regions of England. eight of 13 sequences from non-cases that reported not visiting the restaurant had no SNP difference from the outbreak sequence. three sub-lineages (Figure 2, marked A\u2013C) were apparent. prior to this, genetic variation had been observed, but distinct sub-lineages had not been identified. from November 2015 samples taken from cleaning materials, the pot wash area and wash hand basins were also found to have isolates that matched the outbreak profile. the majority of environmental isolates fell into sub-lineages A\u2013C, however several deep drain swabs were identical to the outbreak sequence. water filled traps failed to prevent foul air flow from the drainage system into the building. smoke testing revealed some ineffective drain seals, potentially allowing contaminated bio-aerosol to be disseminated into the kitchen. cases only nominated 10 controls; failing to achieve a 1:1 ratio. all cases had consumed carvery food. multivariable analysis identified sex and recent antibiotic use, as confounders. no cases or controls ate items from the following menu sections: jacket potatoes, light bites, salads, steaks, hero dishes, classic dishes. a logistic regression multivariable model of carvery food items eaten at a restaurant implicated in a salmonella outbreak, United Kingdom, March 2015 (n = 29a) 71% (53/72) of isolates were identical across their core genome. the remaining 19 case isolates varied from the most frequent genotype by between one and five SNPs. eight of 13 sequences from non-cases reported not visiting the restaurant had no SNP difference from the outbreak sequence. fresh water samples were taken at the beginning of each cluster and in early 2016 (n = 21, all negative) the food trace-back investigations were inconclusive and did not identify suppliers linked with other cases or outbreaks. 0 0 41 12 Surface and deep drain swabs Apr 2016 0 0 59 0 NA May 2016 0 0 10 0 NA Total 9 12 354 106 NA: not applicable; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism; WGS: whole genome sequencing. mapping and visual inspection of the drainage systems identified significant issues. water filled traps (u-bends) designed to prevent foul air flow from the drainage system into the building had failed. investigation identified prolonged outbreak of S. Typhimurium linked to a restaurant where 82 cases (72 confirmed, 10 possible) had eaten food. there was strong epidemiological evidence of a link to the restaurant early in the investigation. drains was implicated in a large outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. previous outbreak investigations have also identified the prolonged survival of food-borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes in drainage systems of food production plants. there was strong epidemiological evidence that eating carvery food was associated with illness. no epidemiological links to outbreak cases with restaurant exposure were identified. asymptomatic carriage was observed during the outbreak. asymptomatic carriage was observed during the outbreak. this outbreak was unexpected in a newly built restaurant managed by a national chain. repeated failures of drains and continued contamination of the kitchen identified here suggest the design and/or installation of drainage systems was suboptimal. consideration should be given to drainage systems which facilitate inspection of water-traps or use of multiple traps should be considered to reduce the impact of failure. the analytical study had a poor response rate and a small sample size. this possibly introduced type II error for other food exposures. this could partially explain why other foods were not identified as potential sources of infection even though contamination in the kitchen was possible. strain of S. Typhimurium was linked to a single restaurant. defective drainage system in the restaurant may have acted as an environmental reservoir. lapses in kitchen hygiene may have enabled intermittent contamination of food during the period of the outbreak."}
