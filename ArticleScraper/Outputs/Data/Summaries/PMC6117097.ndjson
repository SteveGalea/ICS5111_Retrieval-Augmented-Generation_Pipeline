{"summary": "niclosamide has been shown to inhibit the arthropod-borne Zika virus. the antiparasitic agent has been shown to inhibit the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) in vitro and in vivo. DENV belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae with a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome approximately 11 kb in length. the genome contains a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor, which is further cleaved into three structural proteins (C), premembrane (prM) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A niclosamide inhibits mTOR, STAT3 and NF-B signaling pathways. antiviral effects of niclosamide against deNV infection warrant further investigation. niclosamide acts as a proton carrier which blocks endosomal acidification. niclosamide, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, cucurbitacin I, NF-B inhibitor BAY 11\u20137082, bafilomycin A1, protonophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), acridine orange, and mouse mAb specific for -acting. antibodies against Akt Ser473, Akt, p70S6K Thr389, p70S6K, ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204, and ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); antibodies against dsRNA, DENV NS1, NS3, capsid, and E; polyclonal anti-rabbit Atg8 (LC3) I/II. Plaque assay BHK-21 cells were plated onto 12-well plates (7 104 cells/well) after adsorption with a serially diluted virus solution, the solution was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 4% FBS and 0.5% methyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) Fluorescent DENV was prepared by labeling with Alexa Fluor 594 succinimidyl ester. the labeled viruses were purified using Amicon Ultra-15 PLTK Ultracel-PL Membrane (30 kDa) centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to remove excess dye. cells were washed twice after an inoculation with cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the concentration of IFN- in the cell-conditioned culture medium was determined using ELISA kits (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ) the concentration of IFN- in the cell-conditioned culture medium was determined using the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. reagents and antibodies were used in these experiments according to the guidelines of the Animal Protection Act of Taiwan. the animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines established by the Ministry of Science and Technology. seven-day-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 2.5 105 plaque-forming units (pfu) and intraperitoneally with 7.5 105 pfu of DENV2 (PL046) on day 9 post-infection, brain tissue was harvested for the protein assay. blots were separated using SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. after blocking, blots were probed with the indicated antibodies. blots developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, IL) cell washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope. the mean fluorescence intensity of the dsRNA was determined. in vitro cell model of deNV infection examined for viral protein expression and viral release. release of niclosamide at all sub-lethal doses caused minor cytotoxic effects on these cells. niclosamide effectively blocked viral protein expression and significantly retarded viral release. the relative ratios of the measured proteins compared to -actin are also shown. the results showed viral endocytosis at 2 h post-inoculation, which was not retarded by niclosamide. DMSO was used as a solvent control. our findings exclude the possibility of niclosamide blocking endocytosis. niclosamide treatment neither hinders the endocytosis of DENV nor enhances IFN- production to reduce DENV infection. niclosamide treatment does not repress firefly luciferase activity in BHK-D2-Fluc-SGR-Neo-1 cells. niclosamide initiated antiviral effects independent of inhibiting mTOR, STAT3 and NK-kB signaling pathways. treatment with rapamycin effectively deactivated ERK, AKT, and p70S6K. rapamycin treatment enhanced the expression of viral proteins NS3 and NS1. treatment with rapamycin blocked neither viral protein expression nor viral release. acin I (Cu I, 0.01 M), NF-B inhibitor BAY 11\u20137082 (BAY, 1 M) pretreatment, (C and E) representative Western blots showing the expression of the indicated proteins. DMSO was used as a solvent control; -actin served as the internal control. the relative ratios of the measured proteins compared to those for total proteins and -actin are also shown. niclosamide treatment causes endosomal deacidification to abolish DENV2 infection. dsRNA replication, as detected by immunostaining, decreased significantly (P 0.05) by niclosamide, CCCP, and FCCP. amide treatment abolishes DENV infection in vivo and DENV-induced acute viral encephalitis-like disease progression. mice were inoculated with DENV2 by concurrent intracranial and intraperitoneal injections with or without niclosamide (2 or 5 mg/kg) co-treatment. niclosamide inhibited viral protein expression and replication in mouse brains at 9 days post-infection. single-dose treatment of niclosamide partly abolished encephalitic DENV infection in our model. niclosamide treatment reduces viral replication and increases survival rate in suckling mice. niclosamide showed a value of half maximum effective concentration (EC50) near 10 M (S3 Fig). niclosamide effectively blocked viral protein expression (Fig 1B) and significantly retarded viral release (Fig 1C). DMSO was used as a solvent control. ns, not significant. blocking DENV infection by niclosamide does not affect endocytosis of DENV. e: ELISA analysis showing IFN- production in DENV2 (MOI = 1)-infected neuro-2a cells for 48 h with or without niclosamide (Niclo) pretreatment. -actin served as the internal control. treatment with niclosamide caused no direct inhibitory effects on replicon-based assay of viral genome translation or replication. blocking deNV infection with niclosamide had no direct inhibitory effects on FLuc activity in BHK-D2-Fluc-SGR-Neo-1 cells. we found that blocking deNV infection with niclosamide had no direct inhibitory effects on FLuc activity in BHK-D2-Fluc-SGR-Neo-1 cells. treatment with rapamycin effectively deactivated ERK, AKT, and p70S6K. rapamycin treatment enhanced the expression of viral proteins NS3 and NS1. treatment with STAT3 and NF-B inhibitors blocked neither viral protein expression nor viral release. the quantitative data are depicted as the mean SD of three independent experiments. niclosamide causes endosomal deacidification to suppress dsRNA replication and viral release during DENV infection. BHK-21 cells were inoculated with DENV2 (MOI = 1) for 2 h in the presence of niclosamide (Niclo, 5 M), the protonophores CCCP (50 M) and FCCP (5 M), the V-ATPase inhibitor (Baf A1, 100 nM) or rapamycin (Rap, 200 ng/mL) inoculated with DENV2 by concurrent intracranial and intraperitoneal injections with or without niclosamide (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) co-treatment. niclosamide inhibited viral protein expression and replication in mouse brains at 9 days post-infection. suckling mice were inoculated with DENV2 by concurrent intracranial injections. Western blot analysis of viral NS3 and NS1 protein expression. -actin served as the internal control; -actin served as the internal control. niclosamide inhibits the entry of the Chikungunya virus into cells. the target of niclosamide for blocking viral entry/binding was not further addressed. niclosamide reduced IFN- production, likely by suppressing DENV infection prior to the antiviral immune activation. three potent inhibitors of the NS2B-NS3 protease have been confirmed to inhibit the complex formation of DENV NS2B and NS3. niclosamide, temoporfin, and nitazoxanide have been shown to inhibit the complex formation of DENV in vitro. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, niclosamide also inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6K but induced LC3 conversion for autophagy. niclosamide treatment should inhibit the infectious process of DENV prior to the induction of autophagy-facilitated DENV replication. niclosamide inhibits endosomal acidification to reduce viral genome release. co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partly decreases DENV-induced acute viral encephalitis-like symptoms and mortality. cytotoxicity compared to Tween 20-induced 100% cytotoxicity are also shown. CC50 is indicated by dotted line."}
