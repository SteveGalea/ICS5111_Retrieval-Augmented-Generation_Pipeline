{"summary": "feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common viral pathogen in cats worldwide. the prevalence ranges from 10% up to 70% depending on the cat population sampled. it causes painful oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis/stomatitis, inappetence, fever and depression. all cats were group-housed in a confined university facility in four connected rooms (total of 37.2 m2) each cat was clinically examined. blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify the cats\u2019 SPF status. the isolate for the first challenge, FCV 273, originated from a privately-owned cat. the isolate for the second challenge, FCV 27, originated from a privately-owned cat that was clinically healthy apart from oral ulceration on the hard palate. both isolates were obtained from samples collected by Swiss veterinarians using oropharyngeal cytobrushes. the five cats in group 1 were vaccinated subcutaneously at 15 and 18 weeks of age. the cats in group 2 were placebo vaccinated at the same time points with a subcutaneous injection of sterile water. the cats were first adapted and trained for blood and sample collection. opharyngeal cytobrush samples from cats were collected on days 4, 3, 9, 15 and weekly thereafter until day 106 after the first experimental FCV infection. all samples were processed or adequately stored within 4 h of collection. cytobrush from each cat was used for virus isolation on cell culture. the hair was clipped from either the right or left front leg with a trimming machine during the blood collection process in order to visualize the Vena cephalica. one half of the hair collected was transferred to a 1.5 mL safe-Lock Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) and the other half to a micro tube 1.5 mL (Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) containing 300 L DNA/RNA shield. swabs collected on days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43 and 50 after the first experimental infection and on days 4, 3, 8, 15and 56 after the second experimental infection. one set was used for direct RT-qPCR, and the other set was used for virus isolation in cell culture and subsequent RT-qPCR of the supernatants. the cats were housed in the combined cat rooms 1 to 4 (total 37.2 m2; dark orange) within the inner barrier area. the cats had no direct contact with either the ventilation unit or the filter. protective filter paper of the ventilation system was cut into six pieces of 1 cm2 using sterile scissors prior to closing the tube. each piece was transferred to either a 1.5 mL safe-Lock tube (Eppendorf AG) or to a micro tube 1.5 mL (Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) containing 300 L DNA/RNA shield. samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction. negative controls were run in parallel to check for cross-contamination. two different real-time RT-qPCR assays were used to detect FCV. a clean cotton fabric overall, a clean pair of socks and a single-use surgical cap were required to exit the cat facility. the outer barrier had to be passed firstly and the following steps were necessary. the cat beds were cleaned with a small brush to remove hair. the floor was disinfected with 5% sodium bicarbonate (kaia.ch/SFT AG, Pratteln, Switzerland) dissolved in hot water as recommended against FCV. glucoprotamin has only a limited virucidal effect, mostly against enveloped viruses. glucoprotamin has only a limited virucidal effect, mostly against enveloped viruses. group-housed in four connected rooms (total of 37.2 m2) under ethologically and hygienically ideal conditions. each cat was clinically examined, and blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected. the isolate for the second challenge, FCV 27, originated from a privately-owned cat that was clinically healthy apart from oral ulceration on the hard palate. all samples were collected as part of a diagnostic workup; no ethical approval was necessary, in compliance with Swiss regulations [26] the five cats in group 1 were vaccinated subcutaneously at 15 and 18 weeks of age. the cats were vaccinated subcutaneously with a commercially available modified-live virus vaccine (Feligen\u00ae CRP, Virbac AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) the cats were adapted and trained for blood and sample collection. all samples were processed or adequately stored within 4 h of collection. the cytobrush from each cat was used for virus isolation on cell culture. the cytobrush was incubated in 700 L RPMI 1640 (Gibco Life Technologies) the hair was clipped from either the right or left front leg with a trimming machine during the blood collection process. one half of the hair collected was transferred to a 1.5 mL safe-Lock Eppendorf tube. the other half to a micro tube 1.5 mL containing 300 L DNA/RNA shield. swabs collected on days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43 and 50 after first experimental infection and on days 4, 3, 8, 15and 56 after second experimental infection. one set was used for direct RT-qPCR, and the other set for virus isolation in cell culture and subsequent RT-qPCR of the supernatants. the cats were housed in the combined cat rooms 1 to 4 (total 37.2 m2; dark orange) within the inner barrier area. the cats came into the clinical examination and blood/sample collection room once a day. protective filter paper of the ventilation system was cut into six pieces of 1 cm2 using sterile scissors. each piece was transferred to either a 1.5 mL safe-Lock tube (Eppendorf AG) or to a micro tube 1.5 mL (Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) containing 300 L DNA/RNA shield. samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction, and the other set was processed the same day prior to incubation in cell culture. negative controls were run in parallel to check for cross-contamination. two different real-time RT-qPCR assays were used to detect FCV. the inner barrier had to be passed firstly and the following steps were necessary. disposal of the surgical cap to the bio hazard bin, hand wash with soap, hand disinfection with Sterilium\u00ae Virugard. hair wash was only mandatory if the hair was in contact with the cats or anything else within the cat rooms. the floor was disinfected with 5% sodium bicarbonate (kaia.ch/SFT AG, Pratteln, Switzerland) dissolved in hot water as recommended against FCV. the disinfection with IncidinTM Plus (Ecolab, Monheim am Rhein, Germany), containing the active agent glucoprotamin, was performed to prevent introduction of additional pathogens from outside of the facility. FCV 27 and FCV 273 had a sequence identity of 75.8% and 74.7% respectively. compared to FCV F9, FCV 27 and FCV 273 had a sequence identity of 75.8% and 74.7% respectively. using CRFK cell cultures, observation of cytopathic effect (CPE) and FCV RT-qPCR of cell culture supernatants. grey: Absence of CPE in cell culture, but positive in RT-qPCR of cell culture supernatant. food bowl 2 30.9 33.7 33.7 36.8 34.9 36.4 33.6 35.4 37.0 38.0 38.6 37.9 38.6 nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt n food bowls showed the highest frequency of FCV positivity; 13 to 18 time points out 20 tested after the experimental infection were positive for FCV. there was no statistical difference in the frequency of FCV positivity between the three solid dry surfaces in direct contact with the cats. on the Fur of a Cat after the 1st FCV Infection Clipped hair from either the right or left front leg of one cat (JJH3) collected on days 56, 71 and weekly thereafter until day 106 was analyzed by RT-qPCR and CRFK cell culture. only on day 85, the hair sample tested positive by direct RT-qPCR. none of the samples tested in cell culture yielded CPE or RT-qPCR positive supernatant. none of the samples collected at days 3, 8, 9, 15 and 56 after the second infection tested FCV-positive by either RT-qPCR or virus isolation in CRFK cells. all hair samples collected on day 9 after the second challenge were found to be FCV-positive in direct RT-qPCR. aryngeal cytobrushes from six or fewer cats tested FCV positive by RT-qPCR. from day 36 until day 71 only one cat was shedding virus that induced CPE in cell culture. contamination by FCV by RT-PCR after the first experimental infection with FCV 273 was tested by direct RT-qPCR. nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt nt 38.7 n none of the samples from the storage room, outside the inner barrier and inside the outer barrier, tested positive. the highest frequency of positive objects was found early after infection. no samples were collected between day 106 and day 371. no replication Competent FCV Detected on any of the Tested Items after the 1st FCV Infection All environmental items were additionally tested for the presence of replicating virus using CRFK cell culture. no FCV was Found in the Environment and the Cat Fur after the 2nd FCV Infection. none of the samples collected at days 3, 8, 9, 15 and 56 after infection tested FCV-positive by either RT-qPCR or virus isolation in CRFK cells. no FCV viral RNA was found on any of the tested environmental items. no evidence of FCV with replication capacity in the environment. a decrease in environmental contamination was observed over time. we stopped environmental sampling at day 106 until day 371 after the first infection. at day 106, after the first infection, FCV viral RNA was still detected on some items in the cat facility. the persistence of FCV RNA in the environment was at least > 28 days. in a recent study, it was shown that the type of litter used could influence the environmental spread of FCoV via cat feces and litter boxes. the idea arose to test the cat hair of infected cats for the persistence of FCV. at that time, only one cat still tested FCV-positive. in a study of viral genomes in mineral water, the stability of infectious FCV F9, but not the viral RNA measured by RT-qPCR, was affected by the water temperature. the viral capsid could have been damaged by environmental influences resulting in replication incompetent virions that were still detectable by molecular methods. the FCV field strains tested in this study were derived from Swiss domestic pet cats presented to veterinarians with oral ulcerations, gingivitis, stomatitis, fever and depression. the two field strains were passaged and expanded in cell culture only four to five times before inoculation of the SPF cats in the present study. disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate in hot water was successful in preventing the spread of FCV outside of the inner barrier area. this finding emphasized that strict separation of the quarantine area from the rest of the facility is important. the choice of disinfectant is also crucial for the success of FCV prevention."}
