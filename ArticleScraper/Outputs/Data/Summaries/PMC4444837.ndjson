{"summary": "a biological threat of great concern to public safety is the use of an aerosolized pathogenic micro-organism that can be spread in the air. an individual infected with a deadly pathogen can transmit the pathogen at a high human density place or event. besides the intentional release of bioaerosols, natural outbreaks of infectious diseases may occur without warning. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) is strongly established as the method of choice for accurate, sensitive and specific identification of a number of pathogens. the ASAP system successfully trapped the virus-loaded aerosols which were subsequently detected by qPCR. erosols contained in the ambient air are sucked in through the inlet of the ASAP bio-sampler. the individual polyurethane foam strips are then processed for pathogen isolation and nucleic acid extraction. DNA was isolated using the DNAzol reagent (Molecular Research Center) the isolated DNA was resuspended in 25 L of distilled water. the amounts of extracted nucleic acid were quantified by qPCR assay. primers and probes were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Life Technologies) the sequence of primers and probes are as follows: forward primer \u2013 5\u2032- GGGCGAGCAATCAGCTCTTA \u2013 3\u2032 Reverse primer \u2013 5\u2032- CTAATCCACTGCCCATGTACACA \u2013 3\u2032 Probe \u2013 5\u2032- AGTCCCTGCCCACTTTTGCCTGG \u2013 3\u2032. the reaction mixture contained 10x Taqman buffer, 250 nM of forward and reverse primers. each reaction was carried out in duplicate. qPCR was performed using the Mx3000 Thermocycler. the machine was allowed to run for an additional 15 min after the completion of the aerosolization of each sample. each dilution was run in triplicate. the nucleic acid was extracted from the virus trapped in the PUF. the virus purification was done by cesium chloride-density gradient centrifugation as previously described. the DNA from the purified virus was isolated. genome copy equivalent of the virus was calculated with p.f.u. the efficiency of virus recovery was calculated as \u2013 E f f i c i e n c y = C o p y n u m b e r o f v i r u s g e n o m e r e cov e r e d f r o m s p i k e d s 100 Prim quantitative PCR For absolute quantification of the viral genome, a standard curve was obtained using serial 10-fold dilutions of purified genomic DNA of BAd-E1E3. the copy number of the viral genome was calculated based on spectrophotometric quantification and molecular mass of BAd-E1E3\u2019s genomic DNA. each reaction was carried out in duplicate. dilutions of BAd-E1E3 in 0.5 ml were aerosolized with the help of a vibrating mesh nebulizer system. the machine was allowed to run for an additional 15 min after the completion of the aerosolization. a surrogate adenovirus (BAd-E1E3) has deletions in the early region (E) 1 (E1) and E3. the E1 gene products are essential for adenovirus replication. such E1-deleted viruses can be grown only in cell lines that constitutively express E1. the amount of BAd-E1E3 virus trapped on the PUFs was quantified by qPCR and depicted as geometric means. the recovery of nucleic acid was approximately 88% (Table 1). 107, 2 108, or 2 109 genome copies equivalent per 0.5 ml) of BAd-E1E3 were aerosolized with the help of a nebulizer kept at distances of 6 inches (15 cm), 1 foot (30 cm), and 4 feet (122 cm) from the air intake trap. each sample was run in triplicate, and the nucleic acid was extracted from the virus trapped in the PUF using the DNAzol protocol. the ASAP bioaerosol sampler can efficiently monitor ambient air for viral pathogens. we selected a replication-defective bovine adenovirus (BAd-E1E3) having deletions in the early region (E) 1 (E1) and E3. such E1-deleted viruses can be grown only in cell lines that constitutively express E1. the amount of BAd-E1E3 virus trapped on the PUFs was quantified by qPCR and depicted as geometric means. the recovery of nucleic acid by this method was approximately 88%. 108, or 2 109 genome copies equivalent per 0.5 ml, of BAd-E1E3 were aerosolized with the help of a nebulizer kept at distances of 6 inches (15 cm), 1 foot (30 cm), and 4 feet (122 cm) from the air intake trap. the ASAP biosampler efficiently collected and trapped viral aerosols from the air. the minimum detection limit remained unchanged at 2 105 genome copies equivalent (5 103 p.f.u.) ASAP bioaerosol sampler has been tested to sample bacteria and spores or metalliferous airborne particles under field conditions. however, the ASAP sampler had not yet been tested for collection of viral aerosols. the detection of surrogate virus, released from a distance of 10 ft (305 cm), at a concentration as low as 2 105 genome copies equivalent (5 103 p.f.u.) in a room the size of 972 cubic ft (27.5 cubic meters) is quite sensitive by many standards. the majority of the currently available air sampling platforms are based on either impaction onto agar, impingement into liquid, or dry impaction. the iBASS cartridge is removed after every 4\u20138 h of operation. the genetic material, even from the RNA viruses, is expected to remain stable inside the capsid/shell of the inactive virus. the overall recovery of airborne viruses should be estimated based on the detection of genetic material rather than on viral infectivity. the ASAP bioaerosol sampler is highly portable (32 cm/side; 13.6 kg), quiet in operation and has low energy usage. the ASAP system equipment is extremely user friendly and allows changing the default settings of the machine to add attachments such as a GPS, wireless and Ethernet communication, temperature, and wind sensor. iBASS cartridge can hold as many as eight different sampling PUFs along with a blank and negative control. the sampling at different times can be useful to detect the time period when the airborne pathogen was brought into the area. the ASAP bioaerosol sampler can be installed at strategic locations and work in conjunction with additional security surveillance. construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
