{"summary": "current recommendations for the use of CO2 as a euthanasia agent for rats require the use of gradual fill protocols. however, there is concern that the use of these gradual fill methods may increase the distress experienced by these animals. we evaluated social and anxiety behavior of rats exposed to concentrations of CO2 that did not cause a loss of consciousness. euthanasia is defined as \u201cthe ending of the life of an individual animal in a way that minimizes or eliminates pain or distress\u201d. euthanasia is defined as \u201cthe ending of the life of an individual animal in a way that minimizes or eliminates pain or distress\u201d the current recommendations for the use of inhalant anesthetics should be considered when evaluating the use of inhalant gases for euthanasia. the AVMA Guidelines clearly state that high concentrations of CO2 are associated with pain, but suggest that the distress associated with exposure to low concentrations of CO2 over prolonged periods of time is not wellcharacterized. hypercapnia leads to an increase in respiration rate and tidal volume. exposing humans to 5% CO2 increases respiration responses without increasing anxiety. exposure to 7.5% CO2 increases anxiety symptoms. fear and panic can lead to aversion and avoidance. exposing rats to mild hypercarbic gas (e.g., 7% to 7.5% CO2 [21]) increases respiration rate and tidal volume that reduces hypercapnia. this concentration of CO2 does not alter aversion-associated exploratory behaviors in an open field test. cellular activity in panic and anxiety networks induce panic-associated symptoms in humans [33,34] and panic-associated behaviors and cardioexcitation in rats [35,36] and cats [37]. panic responses to 20% CO2 are intact in humans with bilateral loss of amygdala function [39] experiments were designed to evaluate the distress experienced by rats euthanized using 10%, 30%, and 100% volume per minute displacement rates of 100% CO2. each rat was placed into the induction chamber and 100% CO2 was infused at either a 10%, 30%, or 100% volume per minute displacement rate until death. during the euthanasia process, physiological data was collected using telemetry. Sprague-Dawley rats (300\u2013350 g, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were housed individually for 5\u20137 days prior to surgical manipulation. all rats were administered buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) every 12 h for a minimum of two days. rats were anesthetized with 2 to 5% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) rats were fitted with femoral arterial catheters for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) infusions of normoxic 20% CO2 gas consistently induces equivalent cardiovascular and anxiety behavioral responses when there is at least 48 h between challenges. rats were placed in a custom-built Plexiglass\u00ae cylindrical plethysmograph chamber where they were capable of moving. the atmospheric infusion rate was sufficient to prevent any rise of CO2 in the plethysmograph. the treatment group of gas infusions of atmospheric air (1% CO2, 21% O2, 79%) was initiated to euthanize the animals. rats were immediately placed in the open-field box for a 5 min period, then assessed in a social interaction test for 5 min. recordings were scored offline by Cristian Bernabe for time duration of seizure. in humans, loss of consciousness is associated with the inability to engage in verbal communication. periments 1 & 2b) concentrations and in vivo cardiovascular (HR, MAP), respiratory, locomotor activity, and core body temperature were analyzed using an ANOVA with gas as the main factor and for gas concentrations and physiological parameters. a two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze open field behaviors. rats exposed to either atmospheric air or normoxic 20% CO2 for 5 min with telemetric recording of physiologic parameters before, during, and after exposure. rats were behaviorally assessed in an open field chamber and with a second social interaction with an unfamiliar rat. Sprague-Dawley rats (300\u2013350 g, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were individually housed under standard environmental conditions for 5\u20137 days prior to surgical manipulation. all rats were administered buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) every 12 h for a minimum of two days. pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus, reovirus-3, rat parvovirus, sendai virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, and ecto- and endo-parasites. the colony was free of all pathogens during this study. animal care procedures were conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations. rats with 5 min infusions of normoxic 20% CO2 gas consistently induces equivalent cardiovascular and anxiety behavioral responses when there is at least 48 h between challenges. rats were placed in a custom-built Plexiglass\u00ae cylindrical plethysmograph chamber where they were capable of moving with atmospheric air infused at a flow rate of 2.8 L/min using a Vetamac flowmeter. rats were placed in enclosed flow cages (30.5 cm width 30.5 cm in. height 61 cm in. length) for 5 min, then the treatment group of gas infusions of atmospheric air (1% CO2, 21% O2, 79% N2: Praxair, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) was initiated to euthanize the animals. ped and the sessions were scored using ANY-maze for open field (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) or by Stephanie Fitz (who was blind to treatments) for social interaction. the recordings were scored offline by Cristian Bernabe for time duration of seizure. loss of consciousness is associated with the inability to engage in verbal communication. Statistical Analyses for Experiments 1, 2a, and 2b Dependent variables for analyses of CO2 and O2 concentrations and in vivo cardiovascular (HR, MAP), respiratory, locomotor activity, and core body temperature (Experiments 1 and 2a) were analyzed using an ANOVA with gas as the main factor. a two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine equal variances in the groups. the infusions of a custom mixed normoxic 20% CO2 tank led to approximately 24% CO2 concentrations. this could be due to the range error of the sensor, which is +/2% and/or errors in tank preparations. compared to atmospheric air infusions, infusing normoxic, 20% CO2 into a small volume chamber induced a robust and immediate pressor response in the rats that went from baseline means of approximately 120 mmHg to 145 mmHg. this coincided with a dramatic increase in respiration rate in Figure 1d. for in vitro assessments of CO2 concentration changes, we observed a significant gas infusion time interaction (F(40,180) = 8.0, p 0.001, Figure 2a, n = 4,4) with 100% CO2 volume displacement it took 4 min for CO2 concentrations to be >40%, and the chamber reached 100% CO2 11 to 12 min post-infusions. for 30% volume per minute displacement, the decrease was slower and it took 5 min to reach approximately 2% O2. the chamber reached 2% O2 at 13\u201314 min post-infusion. for MAP there was a significant difference in the gas time interaction (F(40,260) = 1.6, p = 0.016, Figure 2e, n = 5,5,5,6). the baseline MAP is 130 to 145 mmHg, which is 10 to 25 mmHg above baselines seen in Figure 1a. over time within subjects\u2019 effects on MAP revealed there was a significant decrease in MAP 4 min post 100% CO2 volume displacement. ping occurred at approximately 1.5 min post-gas initiation, with the 30% volume displacement per minute group gasping for about 20 s. the 10% volume displacement per minute group gasped for 1 min, then stopped for approximately 1 min before resuming and persisting until the mean time for breathing to stop being apparent. s euthanized by the 10% and 30% volume per minute displacement rates stopped moving at approximately 100 s. s euthanized with the 100% volume per minute displacement rate stopped moving at approximately 60 s. rats experiencing the 20% CO2 challenge had increased panic and escape or flight associated locomotor responses. environmental concentrations of 7.5% CO2 do not typically induce symptoms and signs of anxiety in people [12], though there is an increase in the respiratory activity to attempt to blow off excessive CO2 to return the plasma CO2/H+ to homeostasis. however, environmental concentrations of 7.5% CO2 begin to signal air hunger and are anxiety symptom/sign provoking in humans [12] all of the methods led to fairly rapid decreases in blood pressure within 4 min for 100%, and 5 min for 10% and 30%, and a decrease in heart rate within 1 min for 10% and 2 min for 30% and 100%. the telemetry probes have an operational range of 34 to 41 \u00b0C, so any temperatures below 34 \u00b0C are no longer accurate. in this case, the animal would be exposed to anxiety- and panic-inducing concentrations of CO2 without loss of consciousness, for approximately 1 min. however, there is evidence that this could increase the opportunities for exposure to painful concentrations of CO2. carbonic acid has increased high enough in the respiratory tract to interact with nociceptors to signal a burning sensation. the lower the flow of the volume per minute displacement rate, the more time the animal would be left in concentrations of gas that are well-documented to cause anxiety and panic prior to loss of consciousness. this strongly suggests that while the low flow volume per minute displacement rates may minimize pain, they increase the distress experienced by the animal. the behavioral assessment of loss of consciousness in this study provided a less clear picture. we considered the gross loss of motor function as the point where the rat either touched its nose to the ground or began staggering with significant ataxia. the rat would be conscious for as long as 4\u20135 min when euthanized using a 10% volume pre minute displacement rate. but our behavioral data suggested that the loss occurred closer to 1.5\u20132 min. the animals were exposed to high concentrations of CO2 in the absence of any change in O2. the animals appeared to be less distressed than in Experiment 1. a study comparing CO2 displacement concentrations in normoxic, hypoxic, and hyperoxic conditions would be needed to test this hypothesis. rats were removed from their home cage and placed into the novel euthanasia chamber. current best practices for euthanasia suggest it is preferential to transport the animal to the euthanasia chamber [59] and let the animal acclimate to its new surroundings for at least 30 min prior to initiating the euthanasia procedures. the 30% and 100% CO2 groups showed prolonged locomotion within 3 and 5 min post displacement. euthanized rats showed a prolonged period of gasping behavior. only the rats exposed to the 100% volume displacement per minute showed a marked increase in running at onset of the gas. this behavior further supports that high volume displacement rates do not minimize pain or distress. the use of volume per minute displacement flow rates is critical to prevent the exposure of animals to noxious stimuli that can result in pain. however, the results of this study suggest that the use of very low volume per minute displacement flow rates has the potential to significantly increase the distress experienced by the animals. this distress is induced by the prolonged period of time that the rats are exposed to concentrations of CO2 that are known to induce panic and anxiety and the concurrent stabilization of oxygen levels in the chamber."}
