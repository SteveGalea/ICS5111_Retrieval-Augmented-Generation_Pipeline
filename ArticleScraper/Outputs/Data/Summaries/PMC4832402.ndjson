{"summary": "femoral head avascular necrosis is a common disease of the hip joint with an incidence of 10,000\u201320,000 new cases in the united states. radiologic staging of the disease is of pivotal importance allowing the identification and risk stratification in pre-collapse stages, prognosis, adequate treatment planning and post-operative follow-up (2). the universally accepted classification is controversial and is still a matter of debate. only the latest adopted classifications, such as Steinberg\u2019s, ARCO and JOA systems, were designed to include CT and MRI findings. conventional radiography X-ray examination is still considered the mainstay and first line imaging technique in the FHAVN diagnosis. in 18% of patients and in those undergoing steroid therapy (9) joint space narrowing may be present and usually precedes the appearance of the crescent sign in this population. signs of bone repair, such as sclerosis, may be absent due to a decreased bone formation in the presence of normal bone resorption. conventional radiography may be not so accurate and sensitive as more advanced techniques. but it remains of pivotal importance in the late stages of the disease. many studies in literature focus on the role of multidetector CT in FHAVN. sensitivity and specificity of CT and MR accounted respectively 100% for the former and 38 and 100% for the latter. a recent retrospective designed report by barille et al. (18) documented a missed diagnosis in 89% of the hips with FHAVN at CT if compared to MRI. a recent retrospective designed report documented a missed diagnosis in 89% of the hips with FHAVN at CT if compared to MRI. post-operative scans may include T2 Spectral Adiabatic Inversion Recovery (SPAIR) sequences according to different performing centers which is less degraded by metallic artifacts. post-contrast imaging usually is not performed, although it could demonstrate the lack of the enhancement of the necrotic area or a ring enhancement due to the granulation tissue at the border of the lesion. if more than 25\u201350% of the femoral head is affected articular collapse is seen in 43\u201387% of patient. only 5% of patients with an involvement of less than 25% will develop future deformity. MRI could be used to assess post-operative outcome. MRI is considered the gold standard technique in the early stages. conventional MRI is considered the gold standard technique in the early stages when plain films are negative. the role of PWI is to demonstrate perfusion changes in ischaemic bone marrow. it has been previously demonstrated that osteonecrosis is the result of decreased perfusion associated to a stasis in the venous outflow. previous results showed a decreased time to peak, enhancement slope and ratio in patients with TBME. previous results showed a decreased time to peak, enhancement slope and ratio in patients with FHAVN. 7T magnet advantages comprise a 2-fold or 4-fold signal to noise Ratio (SNR) over 3T and 1.5T respectively. images obtained using a home-made coil were judged according to a 4 point scale. depiction of critical structures was at least comparable to that obtained with 3T magnets. SPECT/CT was used in treatment follow-up to determine viability of the graft. a time dependent increase of tracer uptake suggests revascularization (62) few papers in literature deal with PET in FHAVN."}
