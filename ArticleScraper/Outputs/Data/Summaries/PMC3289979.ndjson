{"summary": "prevalence of coronary artery abnormality (CAA) during the KD's acute phase was 11.0% in the 20th nationwide survey. 80% of cases aged between 6 months to 5 years were between 6 months and 5 years. the diagnosis of complete KD was based on fever for more than 5 days together with 4 of the 5 major clinical manifestations. patients who had fever with less than 4 characteristic manifestations were diagnosed as incomplete KD when coronary artery involvement was detected. infants younger than 6 months old took the longest time from the day of symptoms onset to diagnosis. they had the smallest proportion of patients fulfilling complete diagnostic criteria of KD while at the same time the largest proportion fulfilling the criteria of incomplete KD. the ratio of female patients increased in children older than 1 year old, compared to those less than 6 months old. patients who were 6 months old had statistically the lowest hemoglobin, the lowest cholesterol, and the lowest albumin level, but the highest platelet count. the low-density lipoprotein level was the highest in those older than 6 months old. the most likely to develop coronary artery dilatations. even not statistically significant between group 1 and 3, patients 6 months old had more coronary artery aneurysm. glyceride, mean SD, (mg/dL) 121.1 51.0 (n = 17) 139.8 67.6 (n = 69) 124.2 49.1 (n = 69) NS HDL, mean SD, (mg/dL) 21.4 9.5 (n = 17) 22.0 13.5 (n = 27) 25.0 10.3 (n = 62) NS LDL, mean SD, (mg/dL) 58.2 2 n (%) 8 (27%) 1 (3%) 8 (10%) 0.009 0.057 0.35 Valve regurgitation, n (%) 15 (50%) 15 (43%) 31 (39%) 0.744 0.396 0.836 Statistical significance. infants 6 months had the highest rate of coronary artery giant aneurysm compared to other age spectrums. infants 6 months had longer days between diagnosis, more incomplete KD, and fewer patients fulfilling the diagnosis criteria within 10 days. i et al. [36] performed serial coronary artery sections for babies from 17-week gestation to 23 months after birth. only 38% of the newborns have coronary artery intima in the first week of life with intima/media ratio nearly 0.1. the higher CAA incidence in infants 6 months old might be due to the loss of or a thin vascular intima in young infants. sterile pyuria is more frequent in patients 1 year than older children. urethritis is the least common sign of the KD's clinical criteria in infants 1 year old. more likely to have incomplete KD and coronary artery dilatation. sterile pyuria and neck lymphadenopathy are seen in younger infants."}
