{"summary": "the 2-5A system is tightly controlled by synthesis and degradation of 2-5As. degradation seems to be orchestrated by multiple enzyme nucleases including phosphodiesterase 12 and the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase. a purified human phosphodiesterase 12 is used to demonstrate the assays. a purified human phosphodiesterase 12 is used to demonstrate the assays. the assays are presented for both enzyme families."}
