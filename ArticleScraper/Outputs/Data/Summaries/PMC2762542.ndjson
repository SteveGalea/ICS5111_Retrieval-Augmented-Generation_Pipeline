{"summary": "alveolar macrophages (AM) play a central role in maintaining this immunological homeostasis. in the lung, resident AMs are continuously encountering inhaled substances due to their exposed position in the alveolar lumen. they are kept in a quiescent state, but they are kept in a quiescent state. CD8 and likely CD4 T cells must be sufficiently activated to overcome anti-inflammatory factors in the lungs. these rDCs then migrate to the lung draining lymph nodes (DLN) to initiate an antiviral CD8 T cell response. rDC activation and division in the DLNs is a prerequisite for initiation and maintenance of the immune response. mice infected with mice with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (MA15) can be prevented if AMs with anti-inflammatory properties are depleted from the lung prior to infection. this results demonstrate that lethal disease in mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (MA15) can be prevented. BALB/c mice were treated with 75 l of CL or PBS intranasally (i.n.) and total lung cells were harvested after enzymatic digestion. by 48 h, approximately 90% of AMs in the lung were depleted. weight loss and mortality were monitored daily. for virus titers, lungs were homogenized and titeted on Vero E6 cells. for virus titers, lungs were homogenized and titeted on vero E6 cells. treated mice had a much better outcome with less destruction of the pulmonary architecture. but extensive alveolar, interstitial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines increased within 24 hours of CL. mice were treated with CL or PBS 18\u201324 h before i.n. inoculation of 50 l 8 mM CFSE. single cell suspensions were prepared from lung DLNs and gated for CD11c expression by flow cytometry. aDC and iDC increased significantly in drug-treated mice. but only modestly on iDC and not at all on aDC in control mice. rDC migration to draining lymph nodes was accelerated by treatment with clodronate. peptide library covering all four structural proteins (S, N, M, E) of SARS-CoV were identified. adenovirus vectors or DNA constructs expressing single SARS-CoV proteins, or isolated peptides were identified. mice that survived until day 8 p.i. mounted virus-specific T cell responses in the lung, but at a level that was much less than observed in CL-treated mice. target cells were co-stained with PKH26 and different concentrations of CFSE and then incubated with CFSE. 5105 target cells from each group were mixed together and transferred i.n. to infected mice. data are representative of two independent experiments. results thus far suggest that inhibitory macrophages are dominant in lungs. CD86, CD40, F4/80 and CD200R expression on CD11c+CD11bSiglec F+ AM (A) and numbers and frequency (B) of AM were determined by flow cytometry. data are representative of two independent experiments. depleted mice stained with 1 M CFSE and stimulated with splenocytes from nave mice or CD8 T cell-depleted lung cells. cells were then subjected to flow cytometry. data are repesentative of two independent experiments. endogeous AMs were removed from the lung cell preparations by incubation in a tissue culture plate for 2 h (90% depletion, measured by flow cytometry) in the absence of this prior incubation, no robust proliferation was observed. in the absence of this prior incubation, no robust proliferation was observed. mice treated with ligands for several TLRs, including poly I:C (TLR3), LPS (TLR4), CpG (TLR9), R837(TLR7), R848 (TLR7/8), Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), and Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6). mice were treated with 20 g poly I:C or 5 g LPS 18\u201324 h before infection with MA15. single cell suspensions were prepared from lungs and treated mice. CD86, CD40, F4/80 and CD200R expression by CD11c+CD11bSiglec F+ AMs after poly I:C, LPS or no treatment was determined by flow cytometry. poly I:C treatment resulted in an earlier and more robust antigen-specific T cell responses than observed in PBS or LPS-treated mice. clodronate treatment resulted in a modest increase in F4/80 and a small decrease in CD200R expression. soluble CD3 antibody for 72 h in the presence or absence of poly I:C-stimulated AMs from (A) samples were then subjected to flow cytometry. data are representative of two independent experiments. BMDC migration from the lungs to DLNs was accelerated by prior activation. recipients of activated BMDCs developed more robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the lungs compared to resting BMDC recipients at day 7 p.i. tenfold more MA15-specific T cells were detected in the lungs of activated BMDCs compared to resting BMDC recipients at day 7 p.i. n = 12 mice in resting BMDC group; 15 mice in activated BMDC group. viral titers are expressed as PFU/g tissue. (n = 4 mice/group) n = 3\u20134 mice/group. data are representative of two independent experiments. AM depletion before inoculation protected BALB/c mice from lethal MA15 infection. MA15 infection in vitro did not result in upregulation of CD86. mice were monitored daily for weight loss and mortality. at this virus dosage, control mice lost more than 20% of their body weight. depletion of AM before inoculation completely protected mice from this lethal infection. Lungs were fixed in zinc formalin, and paraffin embedded. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. clodronate treatment resulted in enhanced kinetics of virus clearance. mice were treated with CL or PBS 18\u201324 h prior to infection with 3104 PFU MA15. cells were stained for CD11c, MHC class II, CD11b, CD86 and CD40 expression. cells were stained for CD86 and CD40 expression. the total lung cell number increased slightly, but there was no appreciable change in numbers of the respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) in mice. rDC migration to the DLNs peaked at 18 h p.i. in all mice, rDC migration to draining lymph nodes peaked at 18 h p.i. the frequency and number of CFSE+ rDCs in the DLNs decreased. the first 48 h p.i. were most important period for rDC migration. there was also a two-three fold increase in total cell numbers in the DLNs. previously described epitopes were not recognized by lung-derived T cells in our assays. these previous reports identified T cell epitopes using adenovirus vectors or DNA constructs expressing single SARS-CoV proteins. these previous reports identified T cell epitopes using adenovirus vectors or DNA constructs. mice were treated with CL or PBS, 18\u201324 h prior to infection with 3104 PFU MA15 virus. single cell suspensions were prepared from lungs and stimulated with SARS-CoV CD8 (S366, S521 and S1061) or CD4 (N353) T cell peptides for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin A. is present at lower levels on AMs harvested from uninfected mice compared to macrophages isolated from other sites. surface levels of CD200R, important in maintaining lung homeostasis, were not significantly downregulated after infection. number and frequency of AMs increased at day 2 before returning to baseline. aDCs were cultured in the presence or absence of AMs together at a 11 ratio for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and subjected to flow cytometry. single cell suspensions were prepared from the lungs of nave mice or CL-treated MA15-infected mice at day 8 p.i. aDC upregulated expression of CD86, MHC II and CD40. co-culture with AMs prevented CD86 and MHC class II. the prolonged presence of AMs in MA15-infected lungs suggested that AMs inhibited rDCs activation. AM co-culture in vitro did not inhibit IFN- expression after stimulation with MA15-specific peptides. however, AMs did not inhibit IL-2 secretion by Con A-stimulated T cells. further, when AMs and T cells were separated by a transwell, no significant decrease of proliferation was observed. poly I:C (20 g/mouse)-treated mice lost about 10% of their original weight. death occurring in all mice within 6\u20137 days. mice were treated with 20 g poly I:C or 5 g LPS 18\u201324 h. in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 6 p.i. target cells were co-stained with PKH26 and different concentrations of CSFE. target cells were then pulsed with/without SARS-CoV specific CD8 T cell peptides, mixed together and transferred i.n. to mice. poly I:C treatment partially reverses AM inhibition of T cell proliferation in vitro. AMs were harvested from BAL fluid, and cultured at 2.5105/well for 48 h. cells were detached and subjected to flow cytometry. 3105 activated or resting BMDCs were transferred to mice i.n. 18 h prior to infection. BMDC migration from the lungs to DLNs was accelerated by prior activation. more CFSE+ activated BMDC than resting BMDC accumulated in the DLNs of recipient mice. BMDCs were co-cultured with AMs harvested from nave mice for 24 h. BMDCs were stimulated with 20 g/ml poly I:C or 1 g/ml LPS or MA15 virus (m.o.i. = 5) and assayed for CD86 expression. Activation of BMDC enhanced migration to DLN and increased total DLN cellularity. data are representative of two independent experiments and are the mean valuesSEM (n = 6\u20138 mice/group/time point) lymphopenia is associated with a worse prognosis in SARS patients [17],[18],[19], no prior studies have shown that this poor prognosis results, in part, from a sub-optimal CD8 T cell response. this defect occurs because the virus does not reverse the anti-inflammatory state that is naturally present in the uninfected lung. coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, are \u201cinvisible\u201d to cellular sensors in some cell types [ gen-presenting function by rDCs and in increased ability to lyse influenza A virus-infected cells is critical for developing a protective immune response. we used three approaches to support this conclusion. first, pre-treatment of MA15-infected mice with clodronate depleted AM, resulting in enhanced activation and migration of rDCs. rDC in vivo (Fig. 5 C and S7) and in vitro (Fig. 6 A) protected animals from lethal MA15 infection. poly I:C treatment also induced type 1 IFN expression in the lung. this is not likely to be the major effect because SARS-CoV is only modestly sensitive to IFN treatment of cultured cells. BMDCs preferentially migrated to the DLNs and initiated a protective T cell response in the lungs. this transfer was successful because inhibitory AMs cannot reverse prior rDC activation. it is notable that virus-specific T cells are also critical for virus clearance in C57BL/6 mice. SARS-CoV does not effectively activate human DCs or macrophages. MA15 does not effectively induce costimulatory molecule upregulation. but most viruses have mechanisms to evade host recognition sensors. successful resolution of influenza A virus infections requires activation of immune responses. inflammatory properties are depleted from lungs prior to infection. treatment with TLR agonists to activate AMs and rDCs also prevents lethal outcome. pathogenesis of SARS in humans may involve similar stealth mechanisms. the indicated time points post-infection (p.i.) and lungs were removed into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet three days post-infection. the lung vascular bed was flushed via the right ventricle with 5 ml PBS to eliminate any blood and lungs. lymph nodes were cut into small pieces and digested in HBSS buffer. cells were enumerated by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion. all flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSCalibur or an LSR II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer with CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc. Ash, OR) splenocytes from naive mice were costained with PKH26. at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and 5105 cells from each group were mixed together (1106 cells in total) target cells were distinguished from host cells on the basis of PKH26 staining and from each other on CFSE staining. BMDCs were stimulated with or without 20 g/ml poly I:C or 1 g/ml LPS for 18\u201324 h. cells were harvested, stained with antibodies and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and 3105 BMDCs in 75 l PBS were adoptively transfer i.n. 18 h before MA15 infection. mice were kept in the animal care facility at the university of Iowa. lungs were removed into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet three days post-infection. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2% avertin. Lungs were cut into small pieces and digested in HBSS buffer. 2% FCS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase (Roche) were removed. cells were enumerated by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion. rat anti-mouse IFN- (XMG1.2), anti-mouse F4/80 (BM8), rat anti-mouse CD40 (1C10), all from eBioscience (San Diego, CA); rat anti-mouse CD43 (1B11, Biolegend, San Diego, CA); rat anti-mouse CD200R (OX-110, Serotec, Raleigh, NC) for surface staining, 106 cells were blocked with 1 105 cells from each group were mixed together (1106 cells in total) target cells were distinguished from host cells on the basis of PKH26 staining. target cells were distinguished from host cells on the basis of PKH26 staining and from each other on CFSE staining.
