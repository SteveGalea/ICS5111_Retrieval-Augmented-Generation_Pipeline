{"summary": "a large proportion of these infections have viral etiology, in particular in children. 30% of all presumed viral cases fail diagnostic tests for these agents. since 2001, several previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of the human respiratory tract. metagenomic sequence analysis pipeline is available for download at http://www.ifm.liu.se/bioinfo/. pre-assembly screening removed almost a 60% of the 454 reads. sequencing reads into longer contigs significantly increased the accuracy by which sequences could be classified. Approximately 35% of the reads did not assemble into contigs but these singeltons will also be included in the term contig. the largest non-viral portion of the libraries consisted of contigs of putative mammalian origin. 2% of the mammalian sequences, the closest homolog originated from other primates or other mammals, for example rodents. 61% of the leakage of bacterial sequences into the RNA pool was rRNA. rRNA was only 5% of the DNA pool. bacterial part of the sample where sequences were defined by closest homolog. ophilum 256 261 Pedobacter heparinus 204 223 Diaphorobacter sp tpsy 76 206 Moraxella catarrhalis 50 164 Thiobacillus denitrificans 38 144 Acinetobacter sp atcc 27244 118 142 Acinetobacter junii 110 140 Spirosoma lingual 121 124 The top thirty contigs split by bacteria species defined by closest homolog. ambiguous part of 'undefined' was split into taxonomy divisions. contigs showed viral homology Viruses made up 39% (n = 110,931) of reads derived from contigs. resulting, uncertain, major divisions were environmental samples, primate and bacteria. the numbers are the derived number of reads and the family and species designations were manually curated, only alignments with an e-value1e-5 considered. Virus species Contigs Reads (derived from contigs) were manually curated, only alignments with an e-value1e-5 considered. the species list have been manually curated and grouped in cases where yet unclassified strains dilute the species designation. all alignments with an e-value at or above 1e-5 were ignored. a number of hitherto unknown potential pathogens could be and have been discovered using our strategy. the nucleotide identity to known strains of hRSV varied from 82\u2013100%. the contigs homologous to hRSV of identity bellow 90% could potentially be of new types of hRSV and are spread amongst several genes. .7% identity to the vaccine strain while having 95% identity towards the T11wild strain (AB481087.1) the second most abundant virus family was Picornaviridae, which accounted for 31% of the sequence reads. the family was split further into rhinovirus A (65%), rhinovirus B (0.1%) and rhinovirus C (35%), see Figure 4B. the metagenomic sequence showed two nucleotide substitutions (A to C and W to A) when aligned to the Sanger sequenced. PCR verified sequence previously extracted and submitted as HRV-C34. some representative HRV-A, HRV-B serotypes were included in the analysis. human bocavirus (Parvoviridae) contained 161 contigs that were homologous to Parvoviridae. the vast majority (154) were close homologs to human bocavirus. st1 and st2 were likely to be the dominant bocavirus sequences in the DNA library. torque teno virus (TTV) was first discovered in a search for potential causative agents of non-A to G hepatitis. the sequence identities for TTV/TTMV homologs ranged down to 35% amino acid identity. this indicates that the samples could possibly contain even more distant anelloviruses that were not detected by BLAST. a single read of 252 bp showed weak similarity to the replication initiation protein of banana bunchy top virus. the two sequences were 45.2% identical throughout the amino acid alignment with an e-value of 5e-10. the lowest e-value obtained when excluding viral hits was 7e-04. the circovirus-like sequence was not repeatedly amplifiable from any of the original samples, but gave intermittently positive PCR results. the experience from the densovirus-like sequence prompted an investigation of different extraction methods. pre-assembly screening removed almost a 60% of the 454 reads. the RNA-derived library contained fewer human and repetitive reads. this likely reflected the nature of the input genetic material. pre-assembly screening removed almost a 60% of the 454 reads. the RNA-derived library contained fewer human and repetitive reads as compared to the DNA-derived library. this likely reflected the nature of the input genetic material. the highest scoring hit was assigned as the closest homolog. the \u2018undefined\u2019 category included sequences that lacked a known homolog. the \u2018undefined\u2019 category included sequences that lacked a known homolog. 8% of the mammalian sequences were of human origin. except for the mitochondrion, the closest homolog originated from other primates or other mammals, for example rodents. the top thirty contigs split by bacteria species defined by closest homolog and sorted by closest homolog. a small portion (1.4%) of the contigs was classified as being from other organisms, besides bacteria, mammals or animal viruses. the sequences included hits to various NCBI divisions of life including phages and fungi. contigs found to be of viral origin were further divided into virus families based on their closest homolog. alignments assigned an e-value1e-5, 184 sequences, could not be reliably classified. main virus species that have previously been associated with LRTI in children were present in these samples. the species list have been manually curated and grouped in cases where yet unclassified strains dilute the species designation. the species list have been manually curated and grouped in cases where yet unclassified strains dilute the species designation. s that were represented only by a few sequence reads were not covered by the four 454 sequencing runs. the analysis clearly showed that a number of unknown potential pathogens could be and have been discovered using our strategy [5], [16]. the sample was split into putative species by using the closest homolog. these included haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. the bacterial part of the sample where sequences were defined by closest homolog, and split into classes. 184 629 Acinetobacter sp adp1 280 571 Methylotenera mobilis 47 481 Escherichia coli 78 353

not be classified, since no homolog was found. the ambiguous part of 'undefined' was split into taxonomy divisions. the resulting, uncertain, major divisions were environmental samples, primate and bacteria. human picobirnavirus has not previously been described in nasopharyngeal aspirates. the virus part of the sample split into families (panel A), species found in the Paramyxoviridae family (panel B) and species found in the Picornaviridae family (panel C). human picobirnavirus 1 6 Blattella germanica densovirus 4 4 Penicillium chrysogenum virus 4 4 African swine fever virus 2 2 White spot syndrome virus 1 2 2 Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus A1 2 2 Banana bunchy top virus 2 2 Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus 2 2 Cryphonectria nitschkei chrysovirus 1 2 2 The contigs paramyxoviridae accounted for 38% of the viral content in the samples. the sequences from this family included 80% human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) related reads and 15% human metapneumovirus (hMPV) the sequences were compared to the MMR vaccine strain (AF266290.1). 34 out of 42 contigs showed lower nucleotide identity compared to the vaccine strain. the longest contig of 402 bp showed 90.7% identity to the vaccine strain and 95% identity towards the T11wild strain. novel types of the HRV-C species [20], [21] this genome was deposited into Genbank under the accession number JF436925. the study group tentatively designated the provided sequence as the prototype sequence of a novel type, HRV-C35. the second HRV-C sequence which also covered almost the entire genome was identical to HRV-C34. all of the influenza A homologs, except two, were most closely related to the H3N2 subtype, while the two exceptions were most closely related to H9N2. the difference in identity between the H9N2 and H3N2 database sequences was small. the RNA-derived library contained 52 contigs that were homologous to the measles virus. the nucleotide identity towards known sequences varied from 91% to 100%. due to high vaccination coverage, measles outbreaks are rare in Sweden. human Rhinovirus C (HRV-C) of the Enterovirus genus is associated with severe respiratory infections. the first sequence consisted of 6,858 bp in 7,671 reads thus spanning almost the entire genome. this genome was deposited into Genbank under the accession number JF436925. orthomyxoviridae accounted for 21% of the viral sequences of the sample pool. the majority (96%) of contigs from this family were homologous to the influenza A virus. the remaining contigs belonged to influenza B (2.3%) and to influenza C (1.7%). the two longest human bocavirus contigs were homologous to st2. together they covered almost the entire st2 genome. there is no evidence that KI polyomavirus is a respiratory pathogen. RNA-derived library contained a single contig with 70% amino acid identity to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of human picobirnavirus. it could be amplified directly from one nasopharyngeal aspirate sample, which confirmed that it originated from a human sample. the copy number appeared to be low and the sequence could not immediately be extended further. four contigs from the Parvoviridae family were homologous to various species of the subfamily densovirus. the densovirus-like sequences were found in all samples, including water, when extracted by this kit. the sample contained 11 contigs where the closest homolog was found within the Circoviridae family. human bocavirus (Parvoviridae) contained 161 contigs that were homologous to Parvoviridae. the vast majority (154) were close homologs to human bocavirus. st1 and st2 were likely to be the dominant bocavirus sequences in the DNA library. the sequence identities for TTV/TTMV homologs in our sample ranged down to 35% amino acid identity. this indicates that the samples could possibly contain even more distant anelloviruses that were not detected by BLAST. the sequence we recovered was relatively distant from previously reported picobirnavirus sequences. d mottle Virus has been described as an indicator of fecal pollution of water. the virus may have contaminated the nasopharynx of a sampled patient. the two sequences were 45.2% identical throughout the amino acid alignment with an e-value of 5e-10. the circovirus-like sequence was not repeatedly amplifiable from any of the original samples, but gave intermittently positive PCR results. the experience from the densovirus-like sequence prompted an investigation of different extraction methods. repetitive reads and reads of human origin pre-assembly reduced risk of mis-assemblies. chimeric contigs consisting of reads of both human and viral origin. most genome assemblers appear to solve metagenomic assemblies relatively well. hRSV, hPIV, orthomyxoviridae and Picornaviridae are all known to be present in the human respiratory tract. we also found other viruses known to be replicating in these tissues. this includes human bocavirus, human coronavirus and measles virus. incomplete databases made accurate classification problematic. a related problem was low scores caused by short sequences. some of our virus findings will need to be confirmed by additional sequencing to provide the remainder of the virus genomes. 70% of the samples were derived from children under 7 years. the remaining 30% were collected for diagnosis of suspected influenza. the symptoms of the individual patients were not recorded due to the study design with anonymized samples. between 400 and 1,500 bp in length were cut out and purified. this resulted in a total of 13 DNA libraries and 13 cDNA libraries. both runs were of two plates each, one DNA and one RNA plate. sequencing produced in total 703,790 reads, the runs are summarized in Table S1. reads were discarded if more than 70% of the nucleotides were masked. the 50 bp threshold was chosen as a cut-off as shorter sequences were rare and provided little information. the next two steps of the screening process were performed using NCBI BLAST. for nucleotide homology search, the NCBI nt (minimally non-redundant protein) database (Jan 2010) [13] was used. at the first level, the search pipeline consisted of a nucleotide BLAST search using the megaBLAST algorithm [39] with parameter settings optimized for finding homology around 90% identity. sequences for which a homolog were found with at least 90% identity covering 70% or more of the query sequence, were dismissed from further search the highest scoring homologs of each group were identified, regardless of the score of homologs within other categories. for each query, the top-three hits of each category (mammals, bacteria, viruses and others) were kept. the hits were then ranked using bit-score instead of e-value, in order to avoid database size bias introduced into the e-value. resulting sub-sequences replaced the original sequence in the query-set. a maximum ratio of 10.0 and a minimum bit-score of 20.0 was allowed for each position. the top scoring alignment bit-score for a category n at position p (sn,p) is normalized to Sn,p = max(sn,p, 20.0) value threshold of 103 was used as in previous studies [8] while thresholds for conflicting homology were determined empirically. each sequence could be further partitioned at any taxonomic level by considering the closest homolog. the most common sample was from children under 7 years. the study was approved by the local ethics committee at the Karolinska Institute, the regional Ethical Review Board, Stockholm, Dnr 02-212, 02-422, and 04-836/4. in order to avoid ethical complications, samples were anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual patients. the sequencing produced in total 703,790 reads, the runs are summarized in Table S1. the sequencing produced in total 703,790 reads, the runs are summarized in Table S1. the next two steps of the screening process were performed using NCBI BLAST; searching against first the NCBI databases Human Genome Transcripts and then the human Genome database [13] further reads were discarded if a homolog was found at or above 90% identity covering at least 80% of the query sequence. a homolog was found with at least 90% identity covering 70% or more of the query sequence. the second level of homology searches was performed using the BLASTx algorithm using default parameters. all BLAST searches were performed using the default e-value cut-off of 10, while more stringent thresholds were employed in downstream analysis. a list of equal length to the query was created for each category (mammals, bacteria, viruses and others) the highest bit-score covering each position was noted, called a score map. the algorithm consisted of four major steps: first, parts of the query sequence were identified as a continuous sub-sequence of the query, longer than 50 bp, for which the highest scoring (bit-score) homolog in each position were part of the same particular category. the bit-score ratio for category n at position p, rn,p = Sn,p = max(sn,p, 20.0) is normalized to Rn,p = min(rn,p, 10.0) the result-set was compiled into a final result-set. each sequence was assigned to the category of the highest scoring (bit-score) hit from homology searches if: the e-value of the hit was below or equal to 103. phylogenetic analysis of novel HRV-C genome sequence Multiple sequence alignments and the phylogenetic tree were prepared using ClustalX 2.0.12 [40]. genetic distances were calculated using the Kimura-2 parameter and a Ts/Tv ratio of 2.0. the tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. the resulting ACE-file was further analyzed and contig statistics were extracted for each contig. the final result was regular FASTA output with all extracted information added to each FASTA header line. homolog searches consisted of searching against both a nucleotide and protein database, translating the nucleotide sequences in all six possible frames. a bacterial RNA-polymerase homolog might not be within these n most likely homologs if there were n better (often very similar) viral homologs in the database. each search step was partitioned into searches against four distinct subsets consisting of mammalian sequences, bacterial sequences, viral sequences and \u2018all other\u2019 sequences. parts of the query sequence were identified as a continuous sub-sequence of the query, longer than 50 bp, for which the highest scoring (bit-score) homolog in each position were part of the same particular category. the sequence was split into sub-sequences if, for both sub-sequences, the bit-score of the relevant category was on average at least 2 times as high as the bit-score of any other category, covering the same sub-s each sequence was assigned to the category of the highest scoring hit from homology searches if: the e-value of the hit was below or equal to 103. if the bit-score of the top-scoring hit was at least 33% higher than the second highest scoring hit, the mean position-wise bit-score ratio was ignored thus introducing a top-scoring hit \u2018veto\u2019. the numbers are the derived number of reads. the number or reads, sequences, longest sequences and total bases for assembled sequences (contigs) and singletons."}
