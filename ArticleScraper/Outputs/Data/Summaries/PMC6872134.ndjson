{"summary": "HBoV is the causative parvovirus with a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome [1, 2] belonging to the family Parvoviridae and the subfamily Parvovirinae of the genus Bocavirus. HBoV can cause respiratory tract diseases and acute gastroenteritis [3], which together are a significant worldwide contributor to morbidity and mortality in children up to age 5 [4, 5]. coinfection rates of cases with respiratory infections range from 8.3% to 100%. coinfection ratio is 46.7% relative to gastrointestinal manifestations. development of diagnostic markers for infectious diseases will facilitate more rapid diagnosis and the distinction between infection and non-infectious diseases. iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS was used to detect and characterize differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of the respiratory tract in patients infected with HBoV. iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS was used to detect and characterize differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of the respiratory tract. the clinical characteristics including disease history, prevalence, symptoms, and signs of nasopharynx inflammation were used for diagnosis. bacterial culture and virus isolation, virus serology, immunofluorescence, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to further verify diagnostic results when needed. the acetone protein precipitant was collected by centrifugation, dried in air, and redissolved in 8 M urea/100 mM triethylamonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) solution. the protein solution was diluted 5 times with 100 mM tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTEAB) and then added trypsin at a mass ratio of 1:50 (pancreatin:protein) for labelling the peptide segment was separated by increasing the concentration of Acetonitrile (CAN) under alkaline conditions at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. a total of 42 secondary fractions were collected and merged into 12 fractions. a total of 42 secondary fractions were collected and merged into 12 fractions. proteinpilot software (version 4.5, Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex) was applied to analyze raw MS/MS file data by searching against UniProt database containing 20,240 sequences. only proteins with at least one unique peptide and unused value 1.3 (credibility 95%) were used for further analysis. pathways enrichment analysis was performed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis was performed to validate proteomic quantitation of the 3 candidate proteins PPP2R1A, CUL1 and CETP. positive specimens subjected to nucleic acid sequencing that was aligned with known HBoV gene sequence for HBoV-infection confirmation. patients with bruised knees, elbows, and forehead from January to June 2018 recruited as controls for sampling of peripheral blood. acetone protein precipitant was collected by centrifugation, dried in air, and redissolved in 8 M urea/100 mM triethylamonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) solution. the protein solution was diluted 5 times with 100 mM tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTEAB) and then added trypsin at a mass ratio of 1:50 (pancreatin:protein) merged fractions were desalted on the Strata-X column and dried in a vacuum. the polypeptide sample was dissolved in 2% acetonitrile / 0.1% formic acid. elution was performed in a C18 analytical column (5 m, 100 m x 20 mm) only proteins with at least one unique peptide and unused value 1.3 (credibility 95%) were used for further analysis. proteomic data of iTRAQ were quantified using Proteinpilot software. the distributions of unique peptides showed 795 proteins containing at least 2 unique peptides, accounting for 75.86% of total proteins. the percentages of proteins with 0\u201310% and 20% of coverage were 39.12% and 38.36%, respectively. 293 DEPs were characterized, among which 148 DEPs were significantly upregulated. 135 DEPs were downregulated using a quantitative ratio over 1.5. top two groups were post-translational modification and general function prediction only. proteins were clustered into three main categories: CC, BP, and MF. the y-axis represents the percentage of a specific category of proteins in each main category. the upregulated DEPs were mainly enriched in the proteasome (18) and metabolic pathways (11) the distributions of unique peptides showed 795 proteins containing at least 2 unique peptides, accounting for 75.86% of total proteins. the average length of the peptides was 15.45, and concentrated between 7 and 20 with the 11(Fig 1B) 135 DEPs were significantly upregulated using a quantitative ratio over 1.5. 293 DEPs were assigned to 24 groups according to their function. top two groups were post-translational modification and general function prediction. y-axis represents the percentage of a specific category of proteins in each main category. the upregulated DEPs were mainly enriched in the proteasome (18) and metabolic pathways (11) the pathways associated with downregulated DEPs were related to complement coagulation cascades (34), staphylococcus aureus infection (18), phagosome (13), and metabolic pathways (11) iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS analysis in the plasma of respiratory tract patients infected with HBoV. in total, 1048 proteins were determined, of which 148 DEPs were significantly upregulated and 135 downregulated. these DEPs were associated with a lot of biological processes including immunity, inflammation, signal transduction and regulation. viral-related proteins PPP2R1A and CUL1 were unregulated to modulate the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310) and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling pathway (ko04350) (S1 File), consistent with previous results [29\u201331]. ubiquitin-independent degradation is highly observed during viral infections. ubiquitin molecules altered covalently substrates targeted by proteasome. further study is needed to elucidate TGF-regulated mechanism in interfering with HBoV infection. CETP is involved in regulation of PPARs signaling pathway (ko03320) and TLRs signaling pathway (ko04620), thus playing key anti-inflammatory roles. PPARs belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily including PPAR, PPAR/ and PPAR. PPAR activity was transcriptionally regulated by nongenomic cross-talking with phosphatases and kinases such as ERK1/2, p38-MAPK, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) in the present study, CETP was downregulated during HBoV the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is on many molecular chaperones for protein folding and assembly [44] is very important for protein synthesis and maturation. ER dysfunction was mainly caused by toxic accident that generated in pathogenic development to block vital ER responses. all of the 10 proteins were upregulated, including heat shock proteins 71 kDa, 105 kDa (hsph1), and hsp90-alpha and beta-1(S1 File) previous studies confirmed the involvement of Hsp90 in the assembly and nuclear transfer of viral RNA polymerase subunits. further study is needed to elucidate the functions of these proteins in preventing HBoV infection. docx)."}
