{"summary": "infrared thermal imaging (infrared thermography, IRT) is a non-invasive technique. it allows one to measure and visualize infrared (IR) radiation. the warmer the object, the more thermal radiation it emits. this information provides information on the temperature range of the observed object. the patient should be acclimatized to the study room temperature for at least 15 minutes before the examination. the patient should avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and excessive amounts of coffee or tea, eating large meals, eating large meals, using cosmetics and ointments on the examined area and performing strenuous physical activity. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon (RP) is an episodic, transient ischemia in response to cold or emotional stimuli. in most of the patients its character is benign, with no known cause or underlying condition (primary RP, pRP) but in a small percentage of cases, RP is the first symptom of a connective tissue disease, most commonly systemic sclerosis (SSc) a temperature difference of 2.2\u00b0C between the fingers and the hand is indicative of RP [13] in healthy subjects, the fingers are significantly colder than the hands, even between ischemic episodes. studies by Murray et al. and Schlager et al. [14] concluded that thermal abnormalities in RP patients detected with IRT have a good correlation with actual skin perfusion. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon secondary to dermatomyositis at baseline (A) with only partial rewarming after heat challenge (B) the 4th right finger is significantly warmer (A), with strong rewarming response after heat challenge (B) the remaining fingers are only marginally warmer (B) weijden et al. reported an interesting case of an SSc patient in which IRT made it possible to differentiate between bacterial infection of the DU and ischemic necrosis. after antibiotic treatment, clinical and biochemical signs of infection subsided, but the DU did not heal. potential applications are based on case reports and retrospective studies. the usefulness of IRT in other scleroderma-spectrum disorders, such as dermatomyositis or mixed connective tissue disease, is yet to be determined. s no conflict of interest."}
