{"summary": "phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4) plays a critical role in the cap-dependent initiation of translation (3). eIF4E is regulated by the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), which release eIF4E when it is hyperphosphorylated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) but sequester eIF4E when it is hypophosphorylated (6). ORF1a and ORF1b encode two polyproteins, which can be cleaved into 14 mature nonstructural proteins (11, 12) other ORFs encode eight structural proteins: glycoprotein 2 (GP2), GP3, GP4, GP5, GP5a, matrix (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (13). s host translation shutoff was evident at 24 h postinfection (hpi). cellular polypeptide synthesis was monitored at different time points after PRRSV infection. cellular polypeptide synthesis was monitored at different time points. cellular translation was measured with an antipuromycin antibody (red) nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) as a positive control, uninfected cells were treated with 0.5 mM Ars for 1 h. cells were lysed and analyzed with Western blotting. PRRSV nsp2 and nsp5 induce host translation shutoff. heLa cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression constructs encoding individual PRRSV nonstructural proteins and treated with puromycin. la cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with plasmid (1 g) encoding the individual PRRSV proteins or the empty vector (pCAGGS-Flag) at 30 h posttransfection, puromycin was added to the medium and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 25 min. expression of PRRSV proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody. truncation mutants of PRRSV nsp2 were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-nsp2, pCAGGS-HA-PL2, or pCAGGS-HA-TM (4 g) at 30 h posttransfection, puromycin was added to the medium, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 25 min. we tested the exact intracellular localizations of nsp2 and nsp2-tm. they were transfected with plasmids encoding nsp2 or nsp2-tm together with the pDsRed2-Mito plasmid. this expresses the Mito-DsRed2 fusion protein and targets it to the mitochondria. MARC-145 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.5 g of pDsRed2-Mito and then infected with PRRSV for 36 h. the cells were fixed and analyzed with confocal microscopy. ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome system, and apoptosis are the three major intracellular protein degradation pathways in eukaryotic cells. neither proteasomes, nor autophagy, nor apoptosis is involved in the translation suppression induced by nsp2. RNA was extracted from cells shown in panel B. real-time PCR was used to measure the content of EGFP mRNA. nsp2 and TM reduce the transcription levels of host cells. eIF2 phosphorylation, nsp2 and its truncation mutants did not. we measured the mRNA levels of ATF4 and GADD34, which are induced in response to eIF2 phosphorylation. this suggests there is little connection between eIF2 phosphorylation and nsp2-induced translation arrest. PRRSV induces both eIF2 phosphorylation-dependent and -independent host translation shutoff. it is well known that the phosphorylation of eIF2 causes translation to stall. it is well known that the phosphorylation of eIF2 causes translation to stall. western blotting was performed to analyze the levels of translation and eIF2 phosphorylation. eukaryotic mRNAs contain a cap structure at their 5\u2032 ends. eIF4E activity is regulated by both mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. mTOR signaling pathway is attenuated by PRRSV infection and nsp2 expression. all of these results demonstrate that PRRSV infection inhibited mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR inhibition causes almost-complete arrest of protein synthesis. PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff is associated with the attenuation of the mTOR signaling pathway. the same concentration of MHY1485 rescued most mTOR phosphorylation and the cellular translation level in PRRSV-infected cells. cells were treated with sodium arsenite (Ars), an efficient inducer of eIF2 phosphorylation that inhibits global protein translation. PRRSV infection also reduced the level of cell translation in a dose-dependent manner. anti-GAPDH antibody was used to confirm PRRSV replication. cells were treated, and levels of cellular translation were detected by Western blotting. PRRSV preferentially infects porcine alveolar macrophages in vivo. heLa cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression constructs encoding individual PRRSV nonstructural proteins and treated with puromycin. the puromycylated native peptide chains were detected with an antipuromycin antibody, and an anti-Flag-tag antibody was used to verify the expression of viral proteins. three truncation mutants of nsp2 were transfected with constructs encoding nsp2 or one of its three truncation mutants. hek293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding nsp2 or one of its three truncation mutants. a Western blot assay was performed 30 h after transfection to determine translation levels. puromycin was added to the medium at 30 h posttransfection. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 25 min. anti-HA-tag antibody was used to confirm expression of nsp2. nsp2-tm showed a more-diffuse pattern of staining throughout the cells. at the same time, nsp2-tm lost its ability to inhibit translation. we measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the generation of ATP in HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid expressing nsp2. HEK293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g of pCAGGS-HA-nsp2 or pCAGGS-HA-tm. at 30 h posttransfection, ROS and ATP levels were measured with a reactive oxygen species assay kit or ATP assay kit. HEK293T cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.5 g of pEGFP-C1 and pCAGGS-HA-nsp2, pCAGGS-HA-PL2, or pCAGGS-HA-HA-TM. at 16 h after transfection, the cells were treated with MG-132 (20 M), 3-MA (5 mM), or Z-VAD-FMK (10 M) EGFP expression was clearly reduced in the presence of nsp2 or the TM mutant, whereas the PL2 and HV mutants had no effect on EGFP expression. the results show that there were no significant differences in the EGFP mRNA levels in the cells transfected with nsp2 or the empty vector. HEK293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 4 g of pCAGGS-HA-nsp2, pCAGGS-HA-PL2, pCAGGS-HA-HV, pCAGGS-HA-TM, or empty vector. at 30 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed with Western blotting and the indicated antibodies. 20 M ISRIB completely reversed the translation arrest caused by Ars. this concentration (20 M) of ISRIB was used to test whether it reversed PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff. PRRSV infection reduced cellular translation to quite a low level. HEK293T cells were transfected with an nsp2-expressing plasmid. expression of total eIF4E, 4E-BP1, p38 MAPK, ERK, and phosphorylation levels of eIF4E, p70-S6K (S6K), 4E-BP1, mTOR, p38 MAPK, and ERK were determined with Western blotting. as a positive control, HEK293 K293T cells grown in six-well plates were transfected with 4 g of pCAGGS-HA-nsp2 (B) or pCAGGS-HA-TM or pCAGGS-HA-tm (C) the cells were harvested at 30 h posttransfection, and the lysates were analyzed with immunoblotting using antibodies specific for the indicated proteins. mTOR inhibition causes the almost-complete arrest of protein synthesis. blotting was used to analyze levels of translation and mTOR phosphorylation. DISCUSSION Cap-dependent viral mRNAs are structurally similar to host mRNAs. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) inhibits translation of host mRNAs in infected cells. the PRRSV genome also has a putative type I cap structure at its 5\u2032 end. the translation of viral mRNAs is cap dependent (51, 52) there are several possible explanations for the exemption of viral translation from host translation shutoff. eIF2 is a key factor in the innate immune response to viral infection. phosphorylation of PKR and probably eIF2 is not the primary drivers to block the translation of herpes simplex virus true late mRNAs in the absence of virion host shutoff. 4E-BP1 is dephosphorylated during encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. event is almost simultaneous with the shutoff of protein synthesis caused by EMCV (64). phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP, and S6K is reduced 48 h after PRRSV infection (65) the TM domain of PRRSV nsp2 contains a transmembrane structure. it is possible that PRRSV nsp2 induces ER stress via its TM domain. this inactivates the mTOR signaling pathway during the formation of the arterivirus replication complex. the drug 4E2RCat reduces human coronavirus 229E replication and reduces both the intra- and extracellular infectious viral titers. two specific aptamers that recognize PABP1 reduce the expression of the viral genome and the production of infective influenza virus particles (77). at present, vaccination is the principal measure used to control and treat PRRSV infection. PRRSV strain WUH3 (GenBank accession no. HM853673), a highly pathogenic type 2 PRRSV, was previously isolated from the brains of pigs suffering from a high fever syndrome. the pCAGGS-MCS vector was modified by inserting the Flag or HA epitope tag at the N terminus to generate the pCAGGS-HA vector. PRRSV nsp2 and its truncation mutants were inserted into the pCAGGS-HA vector. the pEGFP-C1 vector and the pDsRed2-Mito vector were purchased from Clontech. the specific primer sequences used in this study are listed in Table 1. cells were seeded on circular glass coverslips and grown to 80% to 90% confluence. cells were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and immediately permeabilized with precooled methanol for 10 min. the fluorescent images were acquired with an Olympus FV10 laser scanning confocal microscope. l sulfate\u201310% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and incubated with the primary antibodies. PAMs were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 U/ml penicillin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. dehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were purchased from millipore. an antibody directed against puromycin was purchased from millipore. pCAGGS-MCS vector was modified by inserting the flag or HA epitope tag at the N terminus to generate the pCAGGS-HA vector. g of each sample was reverse transcribed to cDNA with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit. the resulting cDNA was then used as the template in a SYBR green qPCR assay. the abundance of individual mRNA transcripts in each sample was assayed three times and normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA (internal control) fluorescent images were acquired with an Olympus FV10 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) Western blotting. total cellular samples were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in sample buffer (Beyotime) with 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and then resolved with sodium dodecyl sulfate\u201310% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standard curves were generated to calculate the contents of ATP. all the experiments were performed independently in triplicate."}
