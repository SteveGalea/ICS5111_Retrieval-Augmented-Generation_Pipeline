{"summary": "the bat was morphologically identified as a Natterer\u2019s bat (M. nattererii) it was given mealworms and water ad libitum supplemented with minerals and vitamins. in february 2010, the bat began to act aggressively, directly approaching any moving object, vigorously trying to bite, and screaming ferociously. b) Medulla and neurons of the nucleus funiculi lateralis showing strong cytoplasmic staining for rabies antigen. RABV LBV MOKV DUVV EBLV-1 EBLV-2 ABLV BBLV W239.17. BBLV differed from all other published lyssavirus sequences with the highest nucleotide identity to KHUV (80%), followed by ARAV (79%), EBLV-2 (79%), Australia bat lyssavirus (77%), EBLV-1 (77%), Irkut virus (76%), Shimoni virus (76%), RABV (73-75%) and Duvenhage virus (75%). lyssavirus from a Natterer\u2019s bat died with rabies-like clinical signs. BBLV is pathogenic because it caused a fatal disease in the Natterer\u2019s bat that was similar to the clinical picture of rabies in other bats. 63 Natterer\u2019s bats tested during 1999\u20132010 in a retrospective study. none tested positive for rabies. this is the second discovery in recent years of a new lyssavirus species. in vitro and in vivo cross-neutralization and protection studies with current anti-RABV vaccines are urgently required for assessing the public health risk posed by this new lyssavirus."}
