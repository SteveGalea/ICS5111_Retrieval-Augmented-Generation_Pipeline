{"summary": "the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex formation is dependent on the backbone of the nucleic acid. the sequence dependence of the thermodynamics of DNA/DNA (15,16), RNA/RNA (17,18) and DNA/RNA (19) duplexes differ. all, however, can be approximated well by nearest neighbor models. Melting curves were analyzed and thermodynamic parameters were calculated on the basis of a two-state model with the program MeltWin 3.5 (30). agreement within 15% was found for thermodynamic parameters calculated from averaging parameters derived from the shapes of melting curves. Melting curves were measured at 260 nm with a heating rate of 1\u00b0C/min from 0 to 90\u00b0C. agreement within 15% was found for thermodynamic parameters calculated from averaging parameters derived from the shapes of melting curves. only duplexes that melted in a two-state manner were included in the fit. only the duplex m(5\u2032-CGAAGUGAA)/r(3\u2032-GCUUCACUU) does not melt in an apparent two-state manner as revealed by a >15% difference between the H\u00b0s derived from averaging fits to the shapes of melting curves and from the T M 1 versus ln (CT/4) plot. 16.7 8.52 0.15 49.5 47.7 1.5 126.9 4.6 8.38 0.04 49.5 ACAGCCA UGGCUGU 54.4 2.3 147.4 6.9 8.70 0.14 49.9 50.7 0.8 135.7 2.5 8.56 0.02 49.9 ACCACCA UGGUGGU 51.1 3.1 137.0 9.4 8.62 0.18 50.2 47.4 2.6 126.5 8.1 8.50 0.09 50.3 ACCGCCA UGGCGGU 60.0 3.2 2.9 0.43 147.9 14.1 7.05 0.14 40.1 47.2 0.8 129.3 2.7 7.09 0.01 40.7 ACUACAU AUGUAGU 46.5 2.6 132.3 8.7 5.41 0.10 29.7 45.9 1.7 130.4 5.8 5.45 0.07 29.9 ACUACUU AAGUAGU 52.1 1.9 149.3 5.9 5.78 0.10 32.6 46.9 1.2 132.3 4.1 5.91 0.04 32.9 AUU 28 0.11 28.3 CGAGCAAG CUUGCUCG 76.3 8.9 213.2 27.6 10.15 0.35 52.4 70.8 4.4 196.0 13.7 10.01 0.17 53.0 CGUUGAAG CUUCAACG 67.1 11.5 190.3 36.9 8.09 0.09 44.4 76.4 13.1 219.6 41.4 8.27 0.39 44.2 GAGUGAAG CUUCACUC 78.3 5.1 22.6 16.1 9.33 0.21 48.5 79 non-two-state duplex CGAAGUGAA UUCACUUCG 96.6 6.1 277.6 19.1 10.56 0.23 50.5 77.2 2.4 216.8 7.6 9.99 0.07 51.5 aSolutions are 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate and 0.5% Na2EDTA, pH 7. bCalculated for 104 M total strand concentration.

DISCUSSION Thermodynamic parameters for nucleic acid duplexes are useful for designing sequences for many applications. the highest P-values for G\u00b037 were 0.0007 and 0.0005 for the terminal AU and m(5\u2032-AA)/r(3\u2032-UU) parameters. for H\u00b0, however, P-values were 0.29, 0.15 and 0.12 for the initiation, m(5\u2032-GA)/r(3\u2032-CU) and m(5\u2032-CA)/r(3\u2032-GU) parameters. the parameters for terminal AU pairs are 0.30 and 0.45 kcal/mol for 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA/RNA and RNA/RNA duplexes, respectively. the similarity of the sequence dependence of parameters suggests that the programs for predicting RNA secondary structure can approximate 2\u2032-O-methyl modified nucleotides as unmodified RNA. the nearest neighbour stacking parameters for 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA/RNA in 0.1 M NaCl average 0.4 kcal/mol more stable at 37\u00b0C than those for DNA/RNA duplexes in 1 M NaCl (19). the average error limits for the 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA/RNA nearest neighbor parameters for G\u00b037 and H\u00b0 are 0.17 and 3.7 kcal/mol. the thermodynamics may depend on more than the stacking of nearest neighbors and number of hydrogen bonds. the predicted G\u00b0s should be reasonable from 25 to 65\u00b0C."}
