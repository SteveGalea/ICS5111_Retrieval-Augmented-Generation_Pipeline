{"summary": "ARDS cases and at-risk control subjects were recruited from the intensive care unit of the Massachusetts General Hospital. a prior meta-analysis identified five loci for platelet count (PLT): BAD, LRRC16A, CD36, JMJD1C, and SLMO2. this study aims to validate the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of PLT within BAD, LRRC16A, CD36, JMJD1C, and SLMO2 among critically ARDS cases and control subjects were identified from critically ill patients from the ICU at MGH as described previously. we screened each ICU admission for eligible subjects. subjects were followed daily for the development of ARDS. unqualified samples were excluded if they fit the following QC criteria. unqualified SNPs were excluded if they fit the following QC criteria. mean SD (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. all SNPs were encoded at additive genetic format. ARDS risk analysis of SNP variants was used. for ARDS risk analysis, the association of SNP, PLT, and the interaction with ARDS risk were evaluated by logistic regression. the results are described by indirect OR (ORIndirect, per effect allele of SNP) ARDS cases and control subjects were identified from critically ill patients from the ICU at MGH as described previously. subjects were followed daily for the development of ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Committee. unqualified samples were excluded if they fit the following QC criteria. a systematic quality evaluation was conducted on the raw genotyping data according to the general quality control procedure described by Anderson and colleagues. t test or Fisher exact test were used for comparisons between groups for continuous or categorical variables. all SNPs were encoded at additive genetic format (0: wild type; 1: heterozygosity; 2: homozygosity, minor allele as effect allele. ARDS risk analysis of SNP variants was used. the results are described by indirect OR (ORIndirect, per effect allele of SNP) and the 95% CI: OR (the exponential function of the coefficient). the results are described by indirect OR (ORIndirect, per effect allele of SNP) all analyses were performed using R statistical software, v 2.15.1 (The R Foundation). Results No significant differences were observed in age or sex distributions between ARDS and at-risk control groups. 78 (7.60) 5: 250-299 68 (10.81) 91 (8.87) 6: 200-249 90 (14.31) 138 (13.45) 7: 150-199 121 (19.24) 226 (22.03) 8: 100-149 96 (15.26) 178 (17.35) 9: 50-99 99 (15.74) 132 (12.87) 10: 50 44 (7.00) 38 (3.70) Sepsis.001 0: No 209 (33.23) c Including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. no SNPs were mapped within LRRC16A. rs189044678 6 25471485 A G 0.0006 LRRC16A Missense, T[Thr]Ile] rs2274089b 6 25488583 A G 0.0890 LRRC16A Intron rs12207840 6 25515904 A G 0.0003 LRRC16A Missense, P[Pro]L[Leu] rs41271819 6 25538140 C G 0.0006 LRRC16A Miss gene-based QTL analysis of PLT on LRRC16A genetic variants. five common SNPs showed a significant joint association with PLT among at-risk control subjects.

LRRC16A encodes capping protein ARP2/3 and myosin-I linker (CARMIL), a cytoskeletal scaffold protein that binds CAPZA2 with high affinity. CAPZA2 is the subunit of the barbed-end actin binding protein that blocks actin filament assembly and disassembly at the fast-growing (barbed) filament ends. platelets contain actin-binding proteins that can bind to and shorten actin filaments. LRRC16A prevents actin polymerization, which impacts the alveolar capillary barrier function."}
