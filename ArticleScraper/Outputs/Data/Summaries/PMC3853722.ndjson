[31], Epipolasis sp. [32], Petromica ciocalyptoides [29], and Haliclona sp. [33], and Petromica citrina [30]. the nomenclature and the chemical shift values in the 1H NMR compound 2 was identified as halistanol sulfate C, a steroid previously reported for Pseudoaxinissa digitata [34] and Epilopasis sp. [32]. the first reported compound of the halistanol family was halistanol sulfate. eight sulfated sterols have been described with this fundamental nucleus. the most promising pharmacological activities described for these compounds were the anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 effects for halistanol sulfates F and G. groups are described to have antiviral properties [34,38,43,44,45,46] and due to the anti-herpetic activity shown by the BF fraction, we decided to verify the anti-HSV-1 activity of compounds 1 and 2 and the TSH fraction. the isolated compounds 1 (SI = 2.46) and 2 (SI = 1.45) showed weak activity. a set of experiments was carried out to determine the stages at which the most active samples (TSH fraction and compounds 1 and 2) affect the viral replication cycle. pretreatment of Vero cells with TSH fraction and compounds 1 and 2 for three hours before viral infection showed that these samples did not affect viral infectivity suggesting that they did not exert protective effects against the HSV-1 infection process. the direct virus inactivating activity of the tested samples, in the absence of cells, was also evaluated. all the tested samples inhibited virus attachment and penetration. the inactivation of HSV-1 could be related to virions binding to heparan sulfate receptors. other natural sulfated molecules, such as sulfated polysaccharides, were also active against HIV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication. a concentration-dependent inhibition of gB glycoprotein synthesized in the late phase of HSV-1 replication was also observed. only TSH fraction reduced gD expression. results suggest an alteration in immediate early protein expression could affect expression of late proteins. the results obtained suggest a strong synergism between TSH fraction, compound 2 and compounds 1 + 2 and ACV, and a moderate synergism when compound 1 was tested in association. a slight or a moderate antagonism was detected, exception to the association of ACV and TSH fraction, at the intermediate concentration (1 IC50), when an additive effect was detected. 0.7 to 0.85 means moderate synergism (++), 0.9 to 1.1 means additive effect (), 1.1 to 1.2 means slight antagonism () and 1.2 to 1.45 means moderate antagonism ( ). the observed synergism between these samples could be explained by the fact that the samples act in different steps of HSV-1 replication than those affected by this anti-herpes drug. compounds 1 and 2 were isolated by C18 column chromatography. structure of compound 1 was determined based on HSQC, HMBC, and COSY spectra. sulfate groups were supported by the IR band (1230 cm1). HMBC correlations of carbons at 27.9 (C26, C27 and C29), 34.2 (C25) and 45.5 (C24) to the proton at 0.86 confirmed that C26, C27, and C29 were connected to C25. compound 1 was identified as halistanol sulfate. the ESI/MS spectrum showed the presence of three sulfate groups. compound 1 showed two methyl doublets at 0.95 and 0.84 on the side chain. compound 2 was identified as halistanol sulfate C. the first reported compound of the halistanol family was halistanol sulfate, isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria cf. moorei Bergquist. the same compound was isolated from Petromica ciocalyptoides and Topsentia ophiraphidites. ibisterol sulfate, isolated from Topsentia sp., showed anti-HIV activity. other compounds with antiviral activity are weinbersterol disulfates A and B isolated from the sponge. NI = no inhibitory activity; a 50% cytotoxicity concentration, Vero cells (g/mL); b 50% viral inhibitory concentration, HSV-1 (KOS strain) (g/mL); c Selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50). a set of experiments was carried out to determine the stages at which the most active samples (TSH fraction and compounds 1 and 2) affect the viral replication cycle. NA = no activity; a 50% virucidal concentration (g/mL); b 50% attachment inhibitory concentrations (g/mL); c 50% penetration inhibitory concentrations (g/mL). all the tested samples inhibited virus attachment and penetration. halistanol disulfate (DS) and halistanol monosulfate (MS) were less active. it was observed that DS was less active than halistanol sulfate and halistanol monosulfate (MS) as well as the MS being inactive against HSV-1. a concentration-dependent inhibition of gB glycoprotein synthesized in the late phase of HSV-1 replication was also observed.
