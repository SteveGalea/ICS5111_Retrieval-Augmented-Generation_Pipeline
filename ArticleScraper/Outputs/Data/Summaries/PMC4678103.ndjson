{"summary": "CWB studies with nonhuman primates failed to demonstrate efficacy. there are no animal studies with convalescent plasma against EVD. key questions include whether antibody titers are high enough in CP and CWB to be effective. several EVD patients (mainly expatriates) have been treated with CWB, CP, or recombinant monoclonal antibodies during the current outbreak [22\u201326] most of these patients received multiple anti-EVD interventions and high-quality supportive care, so it is not possible to assess the efficacy, if any, of passive antibody transfer. the main analysis is planned when a cohort of 130 CP-treated patients have reached day 14 posttransfusion. due to the fluctuating number of new patients and the decline of the outbreak in Guinea, it is difficult to estimate when this will happen. the Ebola-CP consortium in Sierra Leone is conducting a parallel study. the first patient was recruited 19 March 2015 as a control (no CP given); due to the declining outbreak in Sierra Leone, as of 23 July 2015, 3 patients have received CP. a total of 52 patients opted for CWB transfusion with 24 included as controls. none of the ongoing clinical studies have reported findings. designing trials, and recruiting patients, to evaluate CWB and CP has been challenging. the use of immunoglobulin fractions from convalescent animals is effective for treating EVD in nonhuman primates [17] there are no animal studies with convalescent plasma against EVD. key questions include whether antibody titers are high enough in CP and CWB to be effective. clinical trials on CP in the 2014\u20132015 EVD Outbreak in west africa. clinical trials on CP in the 2014\u20132015 EVD Outbreak in west africa. clinical trials on CP in the 2014\u20132015 EVD Outbreak in west africa. study population Confirmed EVD\u2014all ages including pregnant women Confirmed EVD\u2014all ages including pregnant women Confirmed EVD\u2014adults only (>18 y) study population Confirmed EVD\u2014all ages including pregnant women Confirmed EVD\u2014adults only (>18 y) antibody levels Secondary outcomes (1) survival at 30 d; (2) serious adverse reactions; (3) change in VL; (4) safety risks in health workers. the first patient was recruited 19 March 2015 as a control (no CP given); due to the declining outbreak in Sierra Leone, as of 23 July 2015, 3 patients have received CP. designing trials, and recruiting patients, to evaluate CWB and CP has been challenging. only Ebola-Tx has achieved a relatively high sample size (>80 CP-treated patients) design that would provide best evaluation would be a randomized trial in which one or other intervention would be compared with control patients not receiving the intervention. the infection control environment of treatment centers brings with it difficult operational challenges. short and intermittent patient contact by staff in protective clothing is the norm. mistakes are more likely to occur, such as in patient identification, labeling of blood tubes, and request forms during sample collection and packaging. effective plasmapheresis teams were assembled relatively quickly. a transition to simpler, nonautomated systems might be indicated. the use of convalescent blood products is complicated by the requirement to carefully and properly manage the engagement of Ebola survivors. there are currently >15 000 EVD survivors in the 3 high-transmission countries. a single donor, donating 600 mL every 2 weeks, could provide sufficient plasma to treat around 35 patients. this would require either decentralized plasma production or safe transport and storage of CP. hyperimmune globulins are generally considered to be safer and with higher, less variable antibody titers than CP. animal production of hyperimmune globulins is also under exploration. production could be outsourced. +++b +++b +++b ++++b Acceptability in EVD context Well-known procedure Current data suggest reasonable donor acceptability New procedure Presumably good Activity against circulating virus CWB produced during outbreak likely effective Activity to be shown against viruses causing new outbreaks Production time Short (1 d) once donors identified Short (days) once donors identified Months Months Abbreviations: CP, convalescent plasma; CWB, convalescent whole blood; EVD, Ebola the use of CP sourced from within an outbreak is arguably the most readily available source of anti-EVD antibodies. in each new outbreak, available hyperimmune globulins or monoclonal antibodies will first have to be evaluated against the causative strain and possibly followed by the production of a new product."}
