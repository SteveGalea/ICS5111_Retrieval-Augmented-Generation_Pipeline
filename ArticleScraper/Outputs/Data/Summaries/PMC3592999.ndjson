{"summary": "protein epitope mimetics (PEMs) are rapidly gaining prominence as a source of novel leads in drug and vaccine research. they are designed to mimic the three-dimensional surface regions of peptides and proteins recognized by biological receptors. however, exciting opportunities are now also arising for the use of PEMs in the structure-based design of synthetic vaccines. hot spots have become a major focus of interest in protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitor design. hot spots have become a major focus of interest in protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitor design. a higher network organization of interactions can occur at protein interfaces. -hairpin motifs are often found in proteins to mediate protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions. a -hairpin is comprised of two consecutive hydrogen-bonded antiparallel -strands connected by a loop sequence. many variations are observed in backbone conformation in -hairpin loops. a -hairpin loop identified in a protein crystal structure can be transplanted onto a d-Pro- l-Pro template, resulting in cyclic -hairpin mimetic. the template in the mimetic helps to stabilize folded -hairpin conformations and fixes the hairpin register. -bulge occurs when two residues on one strand lie opposite a single residue on the other strand. -bulges affect the directionality of the backbone but also the orientation of side chains with respect to the -hairpin plane. -bulge places side chains of two consecutive residues onto the same side of the hairpin. the mimetic was found to adopt stable -hairpin structures in free solution and when bound in the major groove of the TAR RNA hairpin. side chains on both sides of the peptide hairpin are seen to make intimate contacts with the RNA. cis-peptide bonds are observed in four-residue and five-residue loops. a family of -hairpin peptides can mimic an -helical epitope in the p53 protein and bind with high affinity to its interaction partner, the HDM2 protein. a family of -hairpin mimetics that bind with high affinity and specificity to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was discovered. another was found to bind and inhibit the bacterial -barrel outer membrane (OM) protein LptD. the cationic peptides are first attracted electrostatically to the outer bacterial cell surface because of the presence of excess negatively charged phospholipids and glycolipids. they then invade and disrupt the membrane bilayer(s), eventually causing cell lysis. CAPs can also lyse (typically at a higher concentration) mammalian cell membranes. the lead compound, L27-11, does not cause lysis of bacterial cell membranes. the enantiomeric form is essentially inactive (MIC 32 g/ml) the amino acid sequence of the molecule is unrelated to that of any known naturally occurring CAP. the photoprobe PAL-1 contains photoproline in place of l-proline and a biotin tag at position 1, photolabels LptD selectively. the first indication of a likely mechanism of action came from photoaffinity labeling experiments with the photoprobe PAL-1. ptD exists in a complex with the lipidated protein LptE in the OM of most Gram-negative bacteria [49] where it functions in the final step of lipopolysaccharide translocation to the cell surface. the IM of Gram-negative bacteria is a lipid bilayer composed of phospholipids, while the OM is an asymmetric bilayer composed of phospholipids in the inner leaflet and LPS in the outer leaflet. LptD/E complex accepts LPS molecules from LptA in the periplasm. subsequently translocates them by an unknown mechanism into the outer leaflet. similar accumulations of membrane-like material are seen in E. coli when lptD is downregulated. elicited changes to LPS structure and membrane morphology in wild-type P. aeruginosa cells that were identical to those seen in cells of a conditional mutant in which the lptD gene was downregulated. recently, the folding pathway for native LptD in the E. coli OM has been studied in detail. from P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain is larger (residue 34-924) than that from E. coli. two additional cysteines (Cys49 and Cys134) are present in P. aeruginosa LptD. vaccine development began in the 18th century with the use of whole microorganisms to generate protective immune responses in humans. but live attenuated and inactivated whole viral and bacterial vaccines still belong to some of the most successful human vaccines in use today. emergence of molecular biology signals a new era in vaccine development. the success of this approach in identifying protective antigens has now been demonstrated. the use of recombinant proteins as vaccines continues to rely on the co-administration of suitable adjuvants to provide a sufficient boost to the immune system. this remains problematic because of adjuvant toxicity. mAb fragments bound to target epitopes derived from various human pathogens target antigen/protective monoclonal antibody Epitope conformation Reference Protein Data Bank file HIV-1 Membrane proximal external region of gp41 recognized. -Hairpin [103] 3GHB 3GHE V3 loop of gp120 bound to human mAbs 2557, 1006-15D, 3074, and 268-D -Hairpin [136] 3MLR/S/T/U/U/V/W/X/Y/Z 3GO1 V3 loop of gp120 bound to human mAbs 2557, 1006-15D, 3074, and 268-D -Hairpin 3SDY Hemagglutinin H1N1 with neutralizing human mAb 2D1 Complex [148] 3LZF Sialic acid binding site on hemagglutinin + mAb S139/1 Complex [150] 4GMS/T Respiratory syncytial virus RSV F glycoprotein-derived peptide bound to motavizumab Helix\u2013loop\u2013helix [151,152] 3O41/45 Human metapneumovirus Anti the epitope of interest is transferred onto a new protein scaffold (perhaps more stable, or easier to produce, or more immunogenic) the scaffold can display the epitope in the correctly folded conformation. other nonprotective epitopes on the surface of a recombinant protein may still dominate the immune response. -hairpin mimetics may be very useful in synthetic vaccine design. -hairpin V3 loop is highly immunogenic region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 that becomes exposed on the viral surface once the CD4 receptor on target cells binds to the viral gp120 glycoprotein. the d-Pro- l-Pro template can serve both to stabilize -hairpin conformations and to fix the hairpin register of amino acids in HB and NHB positions. the d-Pro- l-Pro template can also be designed by transplanting the loop sequences from gp120 onto the hairpin-stabilizing d-pro- l-Pro template discussed earlier [22]. the hairpin loops have different hairpin registers in the four complexes. the hairpin loops are fixed after transfer to the d-Pro- l-Pro template. for each, the left side shows the bound V3 loop conformation taken from the Protein Data Bank file. multiple copies of an epitope on the pathogen may engage multiple B-cell receptors on individual B cells. the cross-linking of multiple BCRs at the cell surface generates a powerful signal, which initiates the process of B-cell activation and maturation. viruses and bacteria contain peptide sequences that can function as T-cell epitopes to activate the immune system. VLPs are typically made of viral capsid proteins that self-assemble into particulate structures. the hepatitis B vaccine made from the surface antigen was also the first widely used recombinant protein vaccine to be invented. one idea is to engineer the capsid proteins so that protective foreign epitopes can be inserted and displayed on the particle. synthetic lipopeptide building blocks spontaneously self-assemble into homogeneous nanoparticles in the 20\u201330-nm size range, called synthetic VLPs. the lipopeptide building blocks include a coiled-coil sequence capable of forming a parallel trimeric helical bundle, fused to a CD4+ T-helper epitope. a synthetic protein epitope mimetic can then be coupled close to the other end of the peptide chain SVLPs are produced by spontaneous self-assembly from lipopeptide building blocks. the peptide sequence includes a coiled coil linked to a T-cell epitope. a computer model of the resulting SVLPs is supported by extensive biophysical data. no inhibition was seen for neutralization-insensitive tier 2 strains isolated from HIV-infected humans unless the viruses were first engineered by deleting the V1V2 loop region. this result is in agreement with recent studies showing that V3 loop antibodies often fail to reach their target on intact envelope trimers on the viral surface."}
