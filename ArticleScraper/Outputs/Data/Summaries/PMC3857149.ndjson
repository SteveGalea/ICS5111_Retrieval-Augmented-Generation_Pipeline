{"summary": "there are >70 arboviruses in the genus Flavivirus including JEV, dengue virus (DENV), west Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus. the fatality rate caused by JEV is 10\u201350%. half of survivors have severe neurological sequelae, including persistent motor defects. a cytopathic-effect-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was developed for discovery of JEV antiviral inhibitors. SCH 16 inhibited 50% of plaques produced by JEV at a concentration of 16 g/mL (0.000025 M). strain, Genbank accession no. U47032.1) was propagated in BHK-21 cells with maintenance medium containing 1% FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin. an equal volume of Celltiter-Glo reagents was added to the cells in 96-well white plates and mixed for 2 min on an orbital shaker. microliter of each compound was added to 99 L maintenance medium. the plates were subjected to 30 s horizontal shaking to achieve thorough mixing. three wells of mock-infected cells and three wells of JEV-infected cells containing 1% DMSO were set on each plate as controls. the protein blots were detected with superSignal west Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) the expression of E and GAPDH was normalized by the expression of GAPDH. the changes of E expression were calculated by comparing to the non-compound treated group. BHK-21 cells were seeded in 96-well white plates at 10,000 cells per well. the test compounds at10 M were added to cells at 1 h pre-infection (1 h), during infection (0 h), and 1 h post-infection (+1 h) the percentage of inhibition of each group was evaluated at 120 h post-infection. cell viability was evaluated by celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) an equal volume of Celltiter-Glo reagents was added to the cells in 96-well white plates. an equal volume of Celltiter-Glo reagents was added to the cells in 96-well white plates. a microliter of each compound was added to 99 L maintenance medium. the plates were subjected to 30 s horizontal shaking to achieve thorough mixing. three wells of mock-infected cells and three wells of JEV-infected cells were set on each plate as controls. the protein blots were detected with superSignal west Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate. expression of E and GAPDH was normalized by the expression of GAPDH. the changes of E expression were calculated by comparing to the non-compound treated group. 50 L virus suspension was inoculated into BHK-21 cells in 12-well plates. cells were harvested by freezing/thawing three times and mixed in a tube. expression of E protein was detected by western blotting. BHK-21 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and inoculated with JEV. the compounds were added to cells at concentrations of 5 or 20 M. the cells were fixed in formaldehyde for 5 min and incubated with anti-NS5 Mab. the percentage of inhibition of each group was evaluated at 120 h post-infection. EC50 assay BHK-21 cells were seeded in 96-well white plates at 10,000 cells per well. after 12 h incubation, different concentrations of compounds were added to the cells. we obtained an average Z\u2032 value of 0.910.02, average S/B ratio of 11.90.55, and average CV of 1.951.76% in mock-infected controls. the inhibition rate of each compound at different concentrations was calculated at the end of the assay and plotted in Figure 1A\u2013C. number 1\u20137 in the X axis represent the compounds FGIN-1-27, cilnidipine, niclosamide, UCL 2077, R(+)butylindazone, palmitoyl-dl-carnitine chloride, and TTNPB. expression of viral E protein was examined by western blotting. Lanes 6\u20138 were cells treated with 20 M niclosamide, cilnidipine, and FGIN-1-27. identification of antiviral effects by IFA JEV was propagated in BHK-21 cells. there was no fluorescence signal in the cells, while almost all cells were virus-positive in the cells. the inhibitory effects of the compounds on JEV replication showed a dose-dependent effect. there were no more than 10 plaques (200 PFU/mL) forming on BHK-21 cells by treating with all the three compounds at 20 M. all three compounds showed a high inhibition rate at the stage of post-infection. EC50 and CC50 were calculated by nonlinear regression. the inhibitory effects of all three compounds showed dose-dependent patterns. under the optimized conditions, three independent assays were performed to validate the robustness and reproducibility of the HTS assay. the Z\u2032 values in the three repeats were 0.92, 0.93, and 0.97, respectively. the average coefficient variation (CV) in mock-infected and JEV-infected cells was 1.260.45% and 5.720.23%, respectively. the antiviral effects of three commercial available compounds were identified by western blotting, IFA, plaque reduction assay, and time-of-addition assays. each dot represents the percentage inhibition of compounds at concentrations of 50 M (A), 25 M (B) and 12.5 M (C). expression of viral E protein was clearly decreased by compounds treatment. expression of JEV E protein in the presence of compounds was examined by western blotting. there was an obvious decrease in E protein expression in treated cells (lanes 3\u20138) compared to the JEV-infected cell controls. the cells were treated with anti-NS5 Mab followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. the cells were treated with different concentrations (20, 15, 10 and 5 M) of compounds for 48 h. there were no more than 10 plaques (200 PFU/mL) forming on BHK-21 cells. plaque numbers at different concentrations were counted and plotted in panel D. expression of viral E protein was examined by western blotting. no E protein was detected in the mock-infected controls. IFA was performed to assess the reproduction of JEV in the cells. there was no fluorescence signal in the mock-infected cells. almost all cells were virus-positive in the JEV-infected cells. there were no more than 10 plaques (200 PFU/mL) forming on BHK-21 cells. there were no more than 10 plaques (200 PFU/mL) by treating with all the three compounds at 20 M. all three compounds showed a high inhibition rate at the stage of post-infection. EC50s and CC50s were calculated by nonlinear regression. cilnidipine and niclosamide were 3.21, 6.52, and 5.80 M respectively. HTS showed a high reproducibility including an average Z\u2032 value over 0.9, and a suitable S/B ratio around 10.0. the similar Z\u2032, S/B, and CV values were obtained in the HTS of 1280 compounds. this assay could also be used to determine the EC50 of compound on JEV. cilnidipine is a dual blocker of calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle or sympathetic nerve terminals that supply blood vessels. the toxicity of cilnidipine is low (MLD50 >5 g/kg) and has a low incidence of unfavorable side effects in humans [30]."}
