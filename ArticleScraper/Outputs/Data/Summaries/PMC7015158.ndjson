{"summary": "global genome sequencing initiatives have delivered abundant insights into the viral biosphere. using the information delivered by these analyses to understand virus pathobiology constitutes a recurrent challenge. Integrated structural analyses have proven an effective pathway by which to bridge this gap in knowledge. a pairwise structural alignment involves establishing the degree of equivalence between two superimposed structures. a measure of the root-mean-square distance between the corresponding C atoms of a pair of superimposed protein structures has been used to define structural similarity. a pairwise structural alignment involves establishing the degree of equivalence between two superimposed structures. HSF and MUSTANG perform hierarchical categorization in a step termed \u2018classification\u2019. the initial set of equivalent residues identified by pairwise comparison forms a common structural core between the two structures. a full hierarchical classification is generated. SBPA has been successfully used to relate commonalities in origin and function for several well-studied protein folds. structures of the major coat/capsid protein (MCP) of bacteriophage PM2 (PDB no. 2VVF) and human adenovirus 5 (1P30) are shown. the vaccinia virus, VACV, N1 protein (2I39) are shown. the HA1 domains are colored as a rainbow from blue (n-terminus) to red (c-terminus) the HA2 domains are colored white. the single jelly roll fold was first observed over forty years ago in a structural study of the capsid of the single-stranded RNA tomato bushy stunt virus. it was later observed in the major coat/capsid protein (MCP) of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) human adenovirus. ssDNA flavobacterium-infecting lipid-containing phage (FLiP) branches closely next to bacteriophage PM2 MCP (Laanto et al. 2017), supportive of an evolutionary relationship with the MCP members of the PRD1\u2013adenovirus lineage. a direct connection between sequences of FLiP MCP and previously characterized MCPs has proven elusive. both SHP (Bamford, Grimes, and Stuart 2005; Krupovic and Koonin 2017; Laanto et al. 2017) have been used to rationalize and quantify the proposed divergent evolution of this lineage. a megataxonomic framework with a higher-level taxon (Varidnaviria) has recently been proposed to encompass a subset of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA viruses encoding vertical jelly roll-type MCP structural analyses have revealed that the C-terminal domain (PCTD) of the molecule contains a common -helical core (Fig. 1B), supporting an evolutionarily conserved role in mediating binding of P to the nucleocapsid protein. addition of five -helices to the plant rhabdovirus PCTD, and -helical and -sheet subdomains to the filovirus PCTD have both been shown to regulate viral transcription. lysis of the glycosidic linkage between sialic acid and the glycoconjugate. fold is present in fucose-specific lectins, soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases and phytases. SBPA of six-bladed -propeller structures was identified by application of the NDV-HN (PDB no. 1E8T) into the DALI server. subsequently performed with the following structures: meV-H, measles virus hemagglutinin (2RKC); sosV-HN, sosuga virus HN (6SG8) A/ALB N7 (4QN3), A/Ukraine N8 (2HT5), A/Australia N9 (7NN9), A/Guatemala NL10 (4FVK), A/Peru NL11 (4K3Y); Salmonella typhimurium sialidase (3SIL); Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (1MR5); Streptococcus pneumoniae NanA (2YA4); Clostridium perfringens Nan -propeller structures known to bind sialic acid are highlighted with a light blue background. -propeller structures that bind proteinaceous receptors are highlighted with a light red background. the receptor-binding site is highlighted with a light blue background. close examination provides several insights into the relationships between these proteins. first, the SBPA reveals that despite low levels of sequence conservation, poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins cluster closely together. the structural relationship between poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins echoes their independently acquired functions. the single jelly roll fold was first observed over forty years ago in a structural study of the capsid of the single-stranded RNA tomato bushy stunt virus. the fold was later observed in the major coat/capsid protein (MCP) of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) human adenovirus (Roberts et al. 1986; Stewart et al. 1991) vobacterium-infecting, lipid-containing phage (FLiP) revealed that despite the difference in the type of genetic material packaged within the virion, the double jelly roll fold is also present in ssDNA viruses. SBPA shows that FLiP MCP branches closely next to bacteriophage PM2 MCP (Laanto et al. 2017) a megataxonomic framework with a higher-level taxon (Varidnaviria) has recently been proposed to encompass a subset of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA viruses encoding vertical jelly roll-type MCPs. such a framework would potentially facilitate a rational structure-complemented approach for classifying newly identified and genetically diverse viruses bearing jelly roll MCPs. the PCTD has acquired additional functionality through structural elaboration of the -helical core. the addition of five -helices to the plant rhabdovirus PCTD, and -helical and -sheet subdomains to the filovirus PCTD have both been shown to regulate viral transcription. the canonical six-bladed -propeller fold is arranged as six -sheets. each comprising four anti-parallel strands is organized around a central axis. previous studies have demonstrated that SBPA of proteins exhibiting this six-bladed -propeller fold results in the bifurcation of viral and non-viral groups. ologous six-bladed -propeller structures identified by application of the NDV-HN (PDB no. 1E8T) into the DALI server. SBPA was performed with the following structures: meV-H, measles virus hemagglutinin (2RKC); sosV-HN, Sosuga virus HN (6SG8). alidase (1MR5); vibrio cholerae sialidase (1KIT); Streptococcus pneumoniae NanA (2YA4); Clostridium perfringens NanI (2VK5); S. pneumoniae NanB (2VW0); Ruminococcus gnavus intramolecular trans-sialidase (1SLL); Homo sapien Neu2 (1SNT); Micromonospora viridifaciens siali a conserved protein architecture facilitates viral and antiviral functionality Cellular proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family modulate apoptosis. the Bcl-2 fold consists of six to seven amphipathic -helices of varying lengths. some viruses, such as poxviruses, have evolved Bcl-2-like proteins. the structural relationship between poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins echoes their independently acquired functions. VACV N1 occupies a position on the phylogenetic tree intermediate between MYXV M11, which only exhibits anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions. xoviruses exhibit some of the highest rates of cross-species transmission amongst RNA viruses. this transmission potential is facilitated by the ability of the six-bladed -propeller domain of the paramyxoviral RBP to productively interact with cell surface receptors that are conserved between different organisms. henipaviral G RBPs and morbilliviral H RBPs both bind proteinaceous receptors (ephrin and SLAMF1/nectin-4), they occupy unique branches. this observation is consistent with the contrasting modes of henipaviral and morbilliviral receptor recognition (Zeltina, Bowden, and Lee 2016). sosV-RBP presents a receptor-binding site incompatible with known modes of HN functionality. SBPA reflects the relatively close structural relationship, yet functional difference of SosV-RBP from HN RBPs. novel roles for structurally distinct influenza virus glycoproteins Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are responsible for negotiating host cell entry and egress, respectively. NL10 and NL11 form a distinct branch that is nearly equidistant from the archetypal influenza A- and B-type NA structural groupings. both HL17 and HL18 do not exhibit great structural divergence from typical HA molecules, indicating that few alterations to the HA scaffold have been required to utilize this receptor. HA1 domains for HL17 and HL18 are colored as a rainbow from the N- (blue) to C-terminus (red) HA1 domains for other HAs are colored white, while HA2 domains are colored dark gray. OW and NW arenaviruses display a glycoprotein complex, GPC. the glycoprotein complex is composed of a retained stable signal peptide. the GP2 forms a class I type fusion architecture. arenaviruses recognize a diverse array of receptors. OW arenaviral GP1 glycoproteins subdivide into two separate structural classes. one class comprises structures of OW GP1s solved in association with a cognate OW GP2 (GP2-bound), and the other contains GP1 structures solved in the absence of a GP2 (GP2-free). a structure-based rationale for how shed OW GP1 may serve as an immunological decoy. the hypothesis that GP2-free OW GP1 glycoproteins present epitopes not represented on the mature GPC is supported by the absence of an effective humoral immune response. GP1 structures are shown in cartoon representation and colored as a rainbow from the N- (blue) to the C-terminus (red) the GP2 component of the GPC was not included in the structure comparison, but it is shown and colored as a white cartoon for clarity. SBPA reveals that the glycoprotein falls outside both NW and OW classes. the near-equal structural distance of LUJV GP1 from both NW and OW classes is supportive of the hypothesis that the glycoprotein structurally and functionally diverged early in evolutionary bifurcation. SBPA of known paramyxoviral HN, H, and G RBP structures has shown that these viral proteins segregate according to receptor-specificity. despite sialic acid and ephrin-specific RBPs exhibiting low levels of sequence conservation within their respective classes. this observation is in-line with the absence of ephrin, SLAMF1 and sialic acid-binding motifs in MojV-G RBP. the zoonotic paramyxovirus, Sosuga virus (SosV) also displays a distinct RBP structure, despite presenting some of the conserved residues known to be integral for sialic acid binding and hydrolysis. HA is responsible for both recognizing sialic acid during host cell attachment and facilitating fusion of the host and viral membranes. NA is responsible for hydrolyzing sialic acid to free virus progeny from infected cells. HL17NL10 (HL, hemagglutinin-like; NL, neuraminidase-like) and HL18NL11 influenza viruses from bats in Latin America. HL17 and HL18 do not exhibit great structural divergence from typical HA molecules. it is likely that the preservation of this close structural proximity may reflect a functionally constrained requirement for HL17 and HL18. evolutionary distance matrix was created using SHP (Stuart et al. 1979) the HA structures are shown in cartoon representation. HA1 domains for HL17 and HL18 are colored as a rainbow from the N- (blue) to C-terminus (red) HA1 domains for other HAs are colored white, while HA2 domains are colored dark gray. arenaviruses recognize a diverse array of receptors, including -dystroglycan (OW and clade C NW), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (OW) (Cao 1998; Spiropoulou et al. 2002); lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (Lassa virus, LASV) (Jae et al. 2014), neuropilin-2 (Lu OW arenaviral GP1 glycoproteins subdivide into two branches. one class comprises structures of OW GP1s solved in association with a cognate OW GP2 (GP2-bound) the other contains GP1 structures solved in the absence of a GP2 (GP2-free) GP1 structures from NW Machupo virus (MACV), Junn virus (JUNV) and whitewater arroyo virus (WWAV) separated into two branches according to respective clades B and D classification. this has been hypothesized to be unlikely as GP2-free NW GP1 elicits a neutralizing antibody immune response following immunization in animal models. the GP2-free structure of the GP1 glycoprotein from LUJV presents a dramatically different architecture to previously reported NW and OW arenaviral GP1 structures. LUJV GP1 was crystallized in complex with the neuropilin-2 receptor, indicative that the observed conformation is likely representative to that observed on the mature GPC. a series of SBPA-based studies focused on the structurally conserved common core of right-handed RNA and DNA polymerases have successfully recapitulated the relationships of the six established right-handed polymerase families in a single phylogeny. this is possible for emerging paramyxoviruses, where the receptor-binding domain, an important determinant of host cell tropism, structurally classifies according to receptor specificity. SBPA can lead to structure-guided hypotheses of whether the glycoproteins displayed by emerging viruses may be capable of misleading the immune response through the formation of structural classes that are distinct from those presented on the mature virion. however, it should be noted that the intricacies of viral protein function may not always be unambiguously represented by means of SBPA. all chains not comprising S1-CTD (e.g. receptor and antibody fragments) were removed prior to structural alignment. branches corresponding to alpha-, beta-, and delta-coronaviruses are colored green, blue, and brown. the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics is supported by grant 203141/Z/16/Z.
