{"summary": "the CF gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, was found in 1989. more than 800 mutations have been sequenced in the mean time. by 18 years of age, 80% of patients harbour Pseudomonas aeruginosa. viral respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients play an important role in the deterioration of lung function of CF patients [11, 12] Respiratory illnesses occur significantly more often in CF patients than in the genetically healthy control subjects. most hospital admissions for pulmonary exacerbations of CF patients are preceded by viral infections. the CF patients with the highest frequency of viral infections seem to be the younger ones who have the lowest rate of decline in lung function and in severity score. the presence of viral infection in association with a pulmonary exacerbation do not adversely affect lung function or inflammatory markers in the short term in this population. viral infections in CF patients show acute onset of respiratory distress. admission to hospital is associated with early acquisition of P. aeruginosa. bacterial colonization and increased anti-pseudomonal antibody levels are typical for episodes of viral respiratory infections. the real-time PCR method carried out on sputum may provide a convenient method of investigating the role of virus infection in respiratory exacerbations of CF patients. the short time-to-result and the potential to facilitate clinical decisions, e.g. concerning the use of anti-viral drugs and administration of antibiotics, are the main advantages of real-time PCR. ovirus C (hAdV C) Penton group Cw 78 Forward primer C-F TCGACACCACCCGTGTGTAC [27] Reverse primer C-R TGCTGTGGTCGTGTTT Probe C TGGACAACAAGTCAACGGATGTGGCA Human Adenovirus D (hAdV D) VA RNA 143 Forward primer D-F AAAAACGAAAGCGGTTGAGC [28] Reverse primer D-R CGGGTGTGT 85 Forward primer F3 TGGCGGGTGATAATATGT [30] Reverse primer R3 GAGGGCATAGCTCTATCACACTTAGG Probe P2 ATAGTCCCATCATCAA Human Coronavirus (HCoV) group 2 (OC43 and HKU1) Polymerase 1b 85 Forward primer R1 GGCATAGCACACTTAGG Probe P1 ATAATCCCAACCCATRAG 85 Forward primer CCTTATTAAAGATGTTGATAGCAC Probe P-OC CAC CTCGCTTAAGATGGCCCCCCGTTCGC [28] Reverse primer TGGACTTGAAGATGAACTTAATGAAGC Probe fam-CCGCAACAACTGCAGTATATATCGTCTCA-TAMRA Influenza (IFV) A virus (generic) AMsw 99 Forward primer M+25 AgATgAgTCTCTAACCgAggTCg [31, 32] Reverse primer M-124sw CTgCAAAgACACTTT ATTgTCTgAACTAgRTgTT Probe FluSw H1 TM292 FAM-CCACAATgTAggACCATgTAggACCATgTgCTgT-BHQ1 Seasonal influenza (IFV) A/N1 virus NA1 160 Forward primer N1P-1078 AN AYggYAATggTgTYTggATMggRAg [31] Reverse primer N1P-160 bp ARCTYCCRCTRTAYCCH GCAATG [32, 33] Reverse primer H7-1342 TTCTGAGTCCGCAAGATCTATTG Probe H7+1281 FAM-TAATGCTGTGGTGTGGCA-TAMRA Influenza (IFV) B virus (generic) BM 89 Forward primer BMP-13 gAgACACAATTgCCTACCTACCTgC [31] Reverse primer BMP-102AN TTCCCACCRAACCARCARTgTAAT Probe BMP CAATGGAGATAT Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) Matrix 66 Forward primer TGCTGTTCGATGCCAACAA [27] Reverse primer ATTTTATGCTCCTAGACA Probe TTGCTCTCCTCA Human parainfluenza virus type 4 (HPIV-4) Phosphoprotein 246 Forward primer LPW 1778 AAAGAATTAGGTGCAACCAGTC [35] Reverse primer LPW 1779 GTGTCTGATC atctaaccaactttaca [38] Reverse primer gccaaggaagcatgcaataaa Probe A fam-tgctattgtgcactaaagatgtc-mgbnfq Respiratory syncytialvirus subtype B (RSV-B) Polymerase 94 Forward primer CPXGCCZGCGTGGC [39] Reverse primer gAAACACGGACACCCA viral infections of the upper respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis patients are associated with pulmonary function abnormalities and predispose to secondary bacterial infection and colonization in CF. human Rhinovirus (HRV) is the most commonly detected virus in children with CF. HCoV was the second most prevalent respiratory virus in a 6-month winter period after HRV. the prevalence data were comparable to a cohort of age-matched healthy children. patients CF patients are four times more likely to develop a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) compared with genetically healthy control subjects. LRTIs are an important cause of early acute respiratory tract morbidity in young infants with CF and frequently causes hospitalization for acute pulmonary exacerbations in these patients. the immunosuppressive agent leflunomide was shown to reduce pulmonary viral loads in an animal model using RSV-inoculated cotton rats [59]. the experimental data promise that orally administered leflunomide could be an alternative antiviral therapeutic for RSV infections under leflunomide therapy. influenza infections cause worsening of lung function, disease progression, and increase the propensity to bacterial infections in CF. CF patients with influenza have lower Shwachman scores and are more likely to present elevated C-reactive protein levels than CF patients suffering from other non-bacterial infections. zanamivir and oseltamivir are the antiviral agents of choice in the management and prophylaxis of influenza in CF patients. a unitary dose of oseltamivir higher than the presently recommended dose of 75 mg for patients without CF is necessary for CF patients most probably because CF is associated with an increase in the glomerular filtration rate and in the lean body weight ratio. varicella zoster virus infections can result in infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF even in adult patients requiring intravenous acyclovir and additional antibiotic treatment. CF with pulmonary and meconial syndrome combined with generalized herpes including medulla oblongata involvement can cause the death of newborns. increased virus replication, impaired specific anti-bacterial defence and increased adherence of bacteria to the mucous membrane play a role in the pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections in CF. increased virus load appears as a consequence of lacking nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and 2\u2019, 5\u2019 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 1 induction in response to virus or IFN-gamma. CF patients with LRTI without viral infection express depressed levels of third and fourth complement components. non-CF patients with LRTI do not show complement depression. presence of pathogens in lower airways correlates with levels of inflammation. the development of serious cirrhosis with portal hypertension due to CF is possible. CF \u2013 although rarely presenting with initial hepatic signs \u2013 can manifest with long-term hepatic symptoms. CF children show a normal antibody response after adenovirus infection. pre-existing antibodies may protect against reinfection with negative effects to somatic gene therapy. some serous cell lines from submucosal tracheal glands are poorly susceptible to adenovirus infection and adenovirus-mediated gene transduction. adeno-associated serotype 2-based vectors (rAAV2) administration to the maxillary sinus led to a successful, dose-dependent allele transfer to the maxillary sinus. alterations in the transepithelial potential difference were regarded as suggestive for a functional effect. further research is still necessary to ensure the safe and efficient future use of this new therapeutic option. chemoprophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors and palivizumab are the only practicable procedures in the management of respiratory virus infections in CF patients. only few data illustrate the relationship of respiratory viruses and CF yet."}
