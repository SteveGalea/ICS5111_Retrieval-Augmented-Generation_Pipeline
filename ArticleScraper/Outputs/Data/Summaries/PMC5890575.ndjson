{"summary": "the genus Flavivirus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and includes more than 70 single-stranded plus-sense RNA viral species. the flaviviral genome is a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA of about 11 kb in length. it encodes a single polyprotein, which is co- and posttranslationally processed into three structural (capsid, premembrane or membrane, and envelope) more than 200 million clinical cases of flaviviral infections are reported annually worldwide. nucleoside analog inhibitors have figured prominently in the search for effective antiviral agents. nucleoside analogs enter cells through specific plasma membrane nucleoside transporters. inside the cell, the compounds are phosphorylated by cellular nucleoside kinases resulting in formation of nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates. the phosphorylated group includes protecting moieties to increase hydrophobicity. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of known antiviral agents targeting selected arthropod-borne flaviviruses. the important challenges and complications in antiflavivirus nucleoside analog development are highlighted. uvovska Vero CPE 50.6 ND Lo et al.45 YFV ND ND Cell based 11 >30 Cho et al.43 WNV ND ND Cell based >30 >30 Cho et al.43 GS-5734 AHFV 200300001 Vero CPE 4.2 ND Lo et al.45 KFDV P9605 Vero CPE 1.8 ND Lo et al.45 TBEV Hyp >357 Zmurko et al.62 ZIKV MR766 Vero PA 1.3 >357 Zmurko et al.62 2\u2032-C-methylguanosine TBEV Hypr PS VTR 1.4 >50 Eyer et al.54 WNV New York isol. vero CPE 30 >100 Migliaccio et al.49 DENV-2 New Guinea C Vero CPE 13.6 >60 Migli Eyer et al.23 2\u2032-C-methyluridine TBEV Hypr PS VTR 11.1 >50 Eyer et al.54 ZIKV MR776 Vero VTR 45.45 >100 Eyer et al.23 Sofosbuvir ZIKV ND BHK-21, SH-sy5y, Huh-7 CPE 0.12\u20131.9 >300 Sacramento et al.25 ZIKV ND - Rd Deng et al.76 TBEV Hypr A549 CPE, CFI, VTR 0.9\u20132.99 >100 Lo et al.77 KDFV 200300001 A549 CPE, CFI, VTR 1.51\u20139.29 >100 Lo et al.77 OHFV Bogoluvovska A549 CPE, CFI, VTR 1.42\u20134.01 >100 Lo et al.77 NITD449 DENV (1\u2013 t al.83 Nguyen et al.83 Huh-7 1.9\u201311 PHM 1.3\u20133.2 RO-9187 TBEV Hypr PS VTR VTR 1.48 >100 >100 >100 >100 Eyer et al.90 Eyer et al.90 Eyer et al.90 Eyer et al.90 LIV LI/31 12.33 KFDV W-377 11.37 WNV Eg101 2.33 YFV 17-D al.35 N6-(1-pyrenylmethyl) adenosine TBEV Absettarov PEK PA 5 >50c N6-benzyl-5\u2032-O-trityl adenosine TBEV Absettarov PEK PA 2 >50c N6-benzyl-5\u2032-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-adenosine TBEV Absettarov PEK PA 20 >50c 2\u2032, -O-methylation inhibition 22d \u2013 Flex 2 DENV-3 ND \u2013 2\u2032-O-methylation inhibition 3.2d \u2013 unpublished results, Smee laboratory, Utah Ribavirin and other nucleoside synthesis inhibitors Ribavirin DENV (1\u20134) Various Vero CPE 19.8\u201341.9a >100a,e Crance et al.31 WNV E101 Vero CPE 71.2a >100a,e Crance e a,e Crance et al.31 JEV Nakayama Vero CPE 0.5a >100a,e Crance et al.31 LGTV ND Vero CPE 0.2a >100a,e Crance et al.31 YFV 17D and FNV Vero CPE 0.2; 0.2a >100a,e Crance et al.31 ZIKV DakArB 11514 Vero CPE 1.5a >100 aEC50 and CC50 values are expressed as g/ml. bEC90 values, expressed as g/ml. cCC50 (24 h): the cell culture was TBEV infected and simultaneously treated with the appropriate compound.

C2\u2032 C2\u2032 C2\u2032 2\u2032-C-methyladenosine 7-Deaza-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine 2\u2032-C-methylcytidine 2\u2032-C-methyluridine INX-08189 Uracil N-glycosidic -F (), CH3 () C2\u2032 Sofosbuvir Adenine 7-Deazaadenine 7-Deaza-7-carbamoyladenine N-gly o-trityluridine 1\u2032-Cyano substituted nucleosides GS-441524, a 1\u2032-cyano substituted C-nucleoside derived from 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine,43 was developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. as a treatment for filovirus infections also showing reasonable antiviral activity against paramyxo- and pneumoviruses. side scaffolds represent the initial major class of therapeutic nucleosides developed by Merck Research Laboratories. antiviral activity of 2\u2032-C-methylated nucleosides beyond the Flaviviridae family was reported for representatives of Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae families. the 2\u2032-C-methyl substituent introduced at the nucleoside -face appears to be an important structural element for highly selective micromolar inhibition of tick-borne flaviviruse the triphosphate analogs of 2\u2032-C-methylated nucleosides showed anti-ZIKV potency in a polymerase-based in vitro assay using an active recombinant ZIKV RdRp.61 Strong antiflaviviral activity for several 2\u2032-C-methyl modified nucleosides was also demonstrated using numerous in vivo efficacy models. sofosbuvir was shown to inhibit the ZIKV RdRp in a recombinant polymerase assay68 and to suppress ZIKV replication in different cell-based systems using U87 glioblastoma cells. Interestingly, no inhibition of ZIKV replication with sofosbuvir even at the 50 M level was observed in vero cells. 2\u2032--fluoro-2\u2032--C-methyl modified nucleosides have been identified as inhibitors of DENV. 2\u2032-C-ethynyladenosine represents the lead compound in this series, which inhibited DENV replication with an EC50 of 1.41 M in cell-based assays. NITD008 and NITD203 failed to achieve no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) when rats were dosed daily for two weeks. despite its low micromolar anti-DENV efficacy, this nucleoside disappointingly exhibited only low levels in plasma when dosed orally. nucleosides 2\u2032-O-Methyl substituted adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine were evaluated for their potential anti-TBEV activity. however, no or negligible antiviral effects were observed when tested in both PS and UKF-NB4 cells. two 4\u2032-azido modified nucleoside analogs, 4\u2032-azidocytidine (R-1479) and 4\u2032-azido-aracytidine (RO-9187) showed nano- or micromolar in vitro antiviral activity against TBEV. the anti-TBEV activity of RO-9187 was unexpected, as this compound lacks the 2\u2032-hydroxy moiety. acy of both 4\u2032-azido modified nucleosides was cell-type dependent. the compounds were active only in PS cells, but not in UKF-NB4 cells. balapiravir showed strong in vitro antiviral activity against DENV. the reported results originate from HCV replicon-based assays. 85,86 Imino-C-nucleoside analog BCX4430 is an adenosine analog with the furanose oxygen on the ribose ring replaced by nitrogen. this interesting nucleoside is classified as imino-C-nucleoside. base-modified nucleosides include T-1106,93\u201395 6-methyl-7-deazaadenosine,96 and numerous N6-alkyl or aryl substituted nucleosides. ribosylated analog of the pyrazine derivative T-705 (fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, favipiravir) was described to inhibit the HCV RdRp. mechanistic studies of the 5\u2032-triphosphate of 6-methyl-7-deazaadenosine revealed that this nucleotide is an efficient substrate for viral RdRp (screened against polio RdRp) nucleosides with bulky substituents, such as N6-(9-anthracenylmethyl)adenosine, exert a micromolar antiviral effect. cleosides, 2\u2032,5\u2032di-O-trityluridine and 3\u2032,5\u2032di-O-trytiluridine were identified as inhibitors of DENV-2 and YFV replication. they showed high antiviral potency and favorable cytotoxicity profiles in vero cells. the presence of large, hydrophobic trityl moieties does not make these structures ideal candidates for further drug development. significantly less favorable in vitro activities (>30\u201351.2 M) were reported for WNV and tick-borne flaviviruses, such as AHFV, KFDV, TBEV, and OHFV. a phosphoramidate prodrug of GS-441524, recently entered Phase II clinical trials for treatment of Ebola infections, displayed 10- to 40-fold higher antiviral effect. the 2\u2032-C-methyl substituent introduced at the nucleoside -face appears to be an important structural element for highly selective micromolar inhibition of tick-borne flaviviruses. 7-Deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine together with other 2\u2032-C-methylated species were the first described nucleoside-based inhibitors of ZIKV. antiflaviviral activity for several 2\u2032-C-methyl modified nucleosides was also demonstrated using numerous in vivo efficacy models. 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine substantially improved disease outcome, increased survival, and reduced signs of neuroinfection and viral titers in the brains of AG129 mice infected with a lethal dose of TBEV. a cells, baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21), hepatocarcinoma Huh-7 cells, Jar human placental choriocarcinoma cells, neural stem cells, and brain organoids with nanomolar or low micromolar inhibitory activity. no inhibition of ZIKV replication with sofosbuvir even at the 50 M level was observed in vero cells. thynyl substituted nucleosides have been identified as inhibitors of DENV. 2\u2032-C-ethynyladenosine inhibited DENV replication with an EC50 of 1.41 M in cell-based assays. NITD008 effectively inhibited in vitro replication of TBEV, AHFV, KDFV, OHFV, and POWV. NITD449, designed as NITD449, successfully exhibited both nanomolar anti-DENV activity as well as improved pharmacokinetic parameters. NITD008 and NITD203 failed to achieve no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) when rats and dogs were dosed daily for two weeks. the ability of flaviviral RdRp to discriminate among nucleosides modified at the 2\u2032-position on the nucleoside -face is likely related to the need of the polymerase to avoid incorporation of 2\u2032--deoxynucleoside monophosphates into the viral nascent RNA chain. 3\u2032-C- and 3\u2032-O-substituted nucleosides exhibited no detectable inhibitory effect on TBEV several cytidine analogs with an azido group at the C4\u2032 position were identified as potent inhibitors of HCV replication in subgenomic replicon assays. two 4\u2032-azido modified nucleoside analogs, 4\u2032-azidocytidine (R-1479) and 4\u2032-azido-aracytidine (RO-9187) were found to be active also against WNV. balapiravir was reported to show strong in vitro antiviral activity against DENV of various serotypes. this compound failed to achieve antiviral efficacy in DENV patients. however, the plasma concentration of the compound was higher than the 50% effective concentration. BCX4430 was initially described as an inhibitor of filovirus infections. it exerts antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of single-stranded RNA viruses. this compound has entered Phase I clinical trials for Ebola virus disease treatment. nucleoside inhibitor T-1106 displayed a negligible in vitro activity against YFV in vero cells. this compound exerted favorable efficacy, bioavailability, and low toxicity in a hamster model of YFV infection. the combination of T-1106 with ribavirin gave superior effects compared to monotherapy. a fever virus, marburg virus, and enterovirus A71, showed interesting bioactivity profiles when tested against TBEV. nucleosides with bulky substituents exert a micromolar anti-TBEV effect. in contrast, N2- and N4-substituted analogs showed no antiviral activity. the mechanism of action of these nucleosides is poorly understood. thymidine or 2\u2032-deoxyuridine congeners of 2\u2032,5\u2032- and 3\u2032,5\u2032-tritylated nucleosides led to the loss of antiflavivirus activity or to increased compound cytotoxicity. these compounds may be acting as inhibitors of intracellular viral replication events rather than suppressing either early or late processes of viral infection. methyl donation for both methylation reactions by S-adenosyl-l-methionine is nucleoside analog S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) these nucleosides inhibit the methylation reactions through competitive interactions with the human enzymes. the nucleosides inhibit the methylation reactions through competitive interactions with the human enzymes. a novel series of flexible nucleoside analogs known as \u201cfleximers\u201d have exhibited activity against several hard to treat viruses. the fleximers feature a \u201csplit\u201d purine nucleobase that has been shown to impart significant activity to the nucleoside scaffold. the acyclic nucleoside acyclovir is an FDA approved drug for herpes virus. nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral NTPase/helicase are associated with the COOH-proximal domain of the NS3 protein. flaviviral helicases are capable of unwinding duplex RNA structures during viral replication by disrupting hydrogen bonds keeping the two strands together. nucleoside synthesis inhibitors Ribavirin and other nucleoside synthesis inhibitors have been found to inhibit also NTPase/helicases of WNV, JEV, or DENV. the predominant inhibitory mechanism for ribavirin against flaviviral replication is the suppression of de novo biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. several ribavirin derivatives were recently synthesized and showed interesting bioactivity profiles. ETAR (1--d-ribofuranosyl-3-ethynyl-[1,2,4]triazole) inhibited DENV-2 replication in vero cells by more than 10-fold compared with ribavirin. guanosine exhibited synergistic anti-YFV activity in combination with interferon. the mechanism of action for 5-aza-7-deazaguanosine is currently unknown. however, it is likely that it likely resembles that of ribavirin. methoxypropyn-1-yl]-2\u2032-deoxyuridine and 5-(pyren-1-yl)ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine showed almost a 10-fold lower anti-TBEV potency compared to their perylene-substituted counterparts. such compounds could still contribute to a better understanding of different modes of action of various nucleoside scaffolds. monophosphate prodrug approach has been shown to convert some inactive nucleosides into strong inhibitors. this strategy led to the development of the phosphoramidate prodrug sofosbuvir, which exhibited significantly increased phosphorylation efficacy compared to the parent nucleoside, 2\u2032-C-fluoro-2\u2032-C-methyluridine. the major advantage of C-nucleosides over the canonical N-nucleosides lies in their resistance to unwanted phosphorolysis by intracellular phosphorylases. individual host cellular types can display differences in expression levels of nucleoside kinases and other enzymes involved in nucleoside metabolism and transport. this can result in cell-type dependent antiviral activity as manifest by different EC50 values for the same inhibitor when assayed on different cell tubercidin monophosphate is selectively recognized by flaviviral RdRp. some nucleoside analogs inhibit the mitochondrial DNA or RNA polymerase, resulting in mitochondrial toxicity. newly developed compounds should also be evaluated for their genotoxicity and mutagenicity, as well as for renal, cardiovascular, or liver toxicity. rodent-adapted flavivirus strains, such as the hamster-adapted YFV strain Jimenez, represent other possible options for in vivo antiviral studies. biological properties of such viruses can be considerably different compared with those of the parent human-adapted strains. TBEV mutants resistant to 2\u2032-C-methylated nucleosides are highly sensitive to 4\u2032-azido substituted nucleosides. combination treatment based on two or more inhibitors could be a possible strategy in order to minimize the risks for the emergence of viral drug resistance. specific nucleoside analog-based antiviral therapy in combination with effective vaccination strategies could provide potent prophylactic and curative tools to treat human infections caused by flaviviruses."}
