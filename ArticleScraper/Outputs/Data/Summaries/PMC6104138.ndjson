{"summary": "HFMD is a febrile exanthematous disease with typical symptoms or atypical symptoms. typical symptoms include flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally buttocks and groin. symptoms include inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis. adenovirus (Howe et al., 1990; Eckner et al., 1994) and human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990), as well as large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses (Flemington, 2001) can arrest the host cell cycle to utilize host resources. cyclinD/CDK4 or cyclinD/CDK6 complexes can inhibit the activity of cyclinD/CDK4 or cyclinD/CDK6 complexes to arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. some viruses have been well known to manipulate cell cycle progression by regulating cyclin and CDK expression. cDNA was cloned using oligo-d(T)18 primers (Takara) with the primers shown in Table 1. RT-PCR products were digested by corresponding restriction enzymes and cloned into corresponding restriction sites.

RD cells were deprived serum for 48 h. the following antibodies were used: anti-cyclinE1 (Proteintech), anti-CDK2 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK6 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK4 (Cell Signal), anti-P53 (Cell Signal), anti-P21 (Proteintech), anti-P16 (Proteintech), anti-cyclinB1 (Santa Cruz), anti-CDK1 (Boster), anti-VP1 (Genetex) and anti-histone a high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to generate the cDNA with the oligo-d(T)18 primers (Takara) with the primers shown in Table 1 the 3D and 3C gene were cloned using the product from the reverse transcription reaction as the template. the primer for real time PCR and plasmid construct was provided by the Jilin Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (C CCCTATTGCTCAC TAGCAAAATAGC (BamHI) VP 1 Real time AATGAGGCGAGTGTGGAAC AGGTTGGACACAAAAGTGAACT GAPDH Real time GCAAATTCCATGGCACCGT TCGCCCCACTTGATTTTGG Transfection. at 36 h after transfection, the cells were collected for cell cycle analysis. cell cycle release For synchronizing cells in G0/G1 phase, RD cells were deprived serum for 48 h. fresh 10% DMEM was added to release the cells from G0/G1. the following antibodies were used: anti-cyclinE1 (Proteintech), anti-CDK2 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK6 (Cell Signal), anti-P53 (Cell Signal), anti-P21 (Proteintech), anti-P16 (Proteintech), anti-cyclinB1 (Santa Cruz), anti-CDK1 (Boster), anti-VP1 (Genetex) and anti-histone (GenScript). 293T cells in G0/G1 phase were increased from 40.80 1.05 to 44.89 0.95% (10.02% increase; P 0.00\u20131; Figure 1B) at 48 h post-infection, 293T cells infected with mock (Mock) or with CVA6 (CVA6) at an MOI of 5 were collected for analyzing cell-cycle profiles by flow cytometry. the cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by culture in serum-free medium (Figure 2A) in the absence of infection, 48 h serum starvation increased the ratio of G0/G1 cells from 33.48 0.74 to 47.95 0.25% (P 0.001, Starved+Mock vs. Con+Mock), which verifies that the cells were properly synchronized in G0/G1 phase. the results were standardized using GAPDH mRNA as a control. the expression of VP1 was determined in control medium (Con) or serum-free medium (Starved)-treated cells at 24 h post-infection. the results represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. at 24 h the TCID50/mL of infectious CVA6 particles was 57.72 times higher for total viruses including supernatant and intracellular viruses from G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells (1.57 0.58 108) than from control cells (2.72 0.39 106) non-synchronized cells at 24 h post-infection were much lower for total viruses. the values of TCID50/mL were much lower for total viruses in the S phase-synchronized cells (3.67 0.89 105) than in the control cells (41.4 4.86 105). arrest in S-phase does not affect CVA6 entry. in cells cultured in control medium (Con) or thymidine medium (Thymi) at 24 h post-infection by Western blot analysis. the total progeny viruses (the supernatant and intracellular viruses) were titrated in RD cells. at 24 h post-infection the TCID50/mL value was determined. Flow cytometry determined the cell cycle profiles after culture in control medium (Con) or nocodazole medium (Noco)-containing medium for 24 h. the results are representative of three independent experiments. TCID50/mL of total viruses including supernatant and intracellular viruses was obviously lower in the G2/M phase-synchronized cells (2.95 0.91 105) than that in the control non-synchronized cells (3.10 0.74 106) at 24 h post-infection (P 0.01; Figure 4F). synchronization in G2/M phase does not affect viral entry, but decreases CVA6 production. donin-treated cells were lower than in control cells at 24 h post-infection. TCID50/mL for total viruses including supernatant and intracellular viruses from the G2/M phase-synchronized cells was obviously lower than that from the control non-synchronized cells. at 24 h post-infection, the TCID50/mL value of total progeny viruses was determined in RD cells. results represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. NS, no significant difference; **P 0.01. the results represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. RD cells, mock-infected (M) or infected with CVA6 (I) at an MOI of 1, were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection for the expression of G0/G1-phase related proteins. results were representative of three independent experiments. cyclinE1 and CDK2 promote cell cycle progression from G0/G1 phase to S phase. expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 decreased after 12 h post-infection. ected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 24.34 1.89%. in 3D-PEGFP-transfected cells it is 70.79 0.44%. in 3D-PEGFP-transfected cells it is 70.79 0.63%. for non-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 55.53 1.07. an obvious increase in the G0/G1 phase was observed by ModFit analysis. the increase from 27.66 0.52% for mock-infected cells to 33.37 0.40% for CVA6-infected (20.64% increase; P 0.001;) these data suggest that CVA6 infection induces G0/G1-phase accumulation. at 48 h post-infection, 293T cells infected with mock (Mock) or with CVA6 (CVA6) were collected for analyzing cell-cycle profiles by flow cytometry. the results indicate the mean SD of three independent experiments. RD cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h for G0/G1 phase synchronization. infected with mock (Mock) or infected with CVA6 (CVA6) at an MOI of 1 for 2 h. then the medium was restored to maintain the cell cycle synchronization status for 24 h. at 2 h post-infection (viral entry stage), the VP1 gene levels were increased 1.89-fold in the serum-starved cells compared to the control cells. at 18 h post infection, the VP1 viral protein levels were increased 1.89-fold in the serum-starved cells as compared to the control cells. the expression of VP1 protein in S phase-synchronized cells was lower than that in control non-synchronized cells at 24 h post-infection. TCID50/mL at 24 h post-infection was much lower for total viruses. arrest in S-phase does not affect CVA6 entry, but inhibits viral production. the results were standardized using GAPDH mRNA as a control. the expression of VP1 was determined in cells cultured in control medium (Con) or thymidine medium (Thymi) at 24 h post-infection by Western blot analysis. cells were cultured in control medium (Con) or 25 ng/mL nocodazole (Noco) for 24 h. cells were infected with mock (Mock) or CVA6 (CVA6) at an MOI of 1 for 2 h. fresh control medium or fresh 25 ng/mL nocodazole were treated for another 24 h. the results represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. we also examined the effects of nocodazole on genomic RNA levels. cells were treated with 8 M Oridonin (Figure 5A) at 2 h post-infection, the genomic RNA level in the control cells was not obvious different with that in G2/M phase-synchronized cells. however, at 24 h post-infection the genomic level in the G2/M synchronized cells was lower than in the control non-synchronized cells. the results were standardized using GAPDH mRNA as a control. the expression of VP1 was determined after culture in control medium (Con) or Oridonin medium (Ori) at 24 h post-infection. RD cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h and then mock-infected (Mock) or infected with CVA6 (CVA6) at an MOI of 1. after 2 h of virus absorption, the cells were treated with medium containing 10% FBS. RD cells, mock-infected (M) or infected with CVA6 (I) at an MOI of 1, were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. expression of CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD1, P53, P21, P16, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, and VP1 proteins was analyzed. the extent of the arrest in G0/G1 phase was dependent on the dose of 3D plasmid that was transfected. in 3C-PEGFP-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 24.34 1.89%. in 3D-PEGFP-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 55.53 1.07, 57.86 0.24, and 58.60 0.19%. cell cycle distribution and fluorescence density in 293T cells were analyzed at 36 h after transfection with 4 g PEGFP (Vec), 3C-PEGFP (3C) and 3D-PEGFP (3D) plasmid. the results indicate the mean SD of three independent experiments. cell cycle synchronization in G0/G1, S, and G2/M is executed by serum deprivation, thymidine and nocodazole treatment. synchronization in S and G2/M phase decreases viral replication and inhibits viral production. this suggests that synchronization in S and G2/M phase is most favorable for CVA6 production. host protein expression was examined including cyclinD1, CDK6, CDK4, cyclinE, CDK2, CDK1 and cyclinB1. each of these proteins was down-regulated after CVA6 infection. cyclinB1/CDK1 regulates the mitotic process. authors say research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
