{"summary": "5\u201310 children and a coach had been affected. the latest case was a new onset, suggesting ongoing transmission. a site visit was undertaken and an online questionnaire was sent to all parents. behavioural (advantages/disadvantages of carrying out the behaviour) and normative (individuals or groups who would approve/disapprove; likely/unlikely to carry out this behaviour) are the psychological foundation for human behaviour. one-to-one telephone interviews were carried out using the RAA model\u2019s guidance. a cohort of 3rd year student nurses completed a questionnaire to indicate which of 46 clinical tasks they would routinely wear NSCG for. more than 40% of respondents indicated they would routinely wear NSCG for tasks where they would not be necessary, for example giving IM/SC injection (76%) or taking MRSA swabs (79%). methods Health Facilities Scotland conducted a national survey of transoesophageal (TOE), transvaginal (TV) and transrectal (TR) ultrasound probes. the national survey concluded there was an ongoing risk to patient safety regarding decontamination of SIUPs. data was collected using surveillance forms during inpatient stay and post discharge by community midwives up to 10 days. patient postal questionnaires and telephone surveys were also used for post-discharge SSI data collection. project nurse to provide training and education associated with IC to ward staff. data was collected on the number of patients with indwelling catheters on the project wards: the Stroke Unit; medical wards; trauma and elective orthopaedics. data was collected on the completion of documentation which included an evidence-based bundle for both insertion and ongoing catheter management. 93% were previously known MRSA cases, 89% had attempted decolonisation. 43% had concomitant multi-drug-resistant bacteria colonisation. 68% non-nasal site MRSA carriage were isolated in a single room. LDI over a period of 18 weeks showed a reduction in the levels of bacteria in all four dental chairs. a total of 72 water samples were collected from four different dental chairs and the bacteria (CFU/ml) were enumerated. a total of 72 samples were collected from four different dental chairs. results Where card location or positioning of the equipment did not allow line of sight to the UVC device, the colour change was less intense and took more cycles to reach the level indicated for MRSA or C. difficile kill. positioning of equipment is key to the success of UV light in room decontamination. there were more episodes of 1 day or more in 2016 due to scarlet fever. there were more episodes of 1 day or more in 2016 due to an outbreak of scarlet fever that coincided with the study (2015: 14; 2016: 21 not significant) a negative CPE screen should not be interpreted as an indication of loss of colonisation in an individual who has previously been positive. safety-engineered devices (SED) became mandatory in UK healthcare facilities in 2013. over 50% of HBN were discarded sharp, indicating that a high proportion of clinical staff are unnecessarily at risk of sharps injuries while handling sharps. the high non-use of SED and non-activation of SED is disturbing and needs further confirmation. the susceptibility rates of flomoxef against these ESBL-producing organisms were 71.7% (515 of 718), 64.8% (667 of 1029), 64.7% (669 of 1034), and 75.4% (844 of 1120) in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem against CRPA were enrolled in this study. the susceptibility rates of imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem were 6%, 4%, and 15% respectively, in 2014. imipenem had the highest susceptibility rates against CRPA, indicating that doripenem did not readily select CRPA. Isavuconazole was the most effective antifungal tested, followed by posaconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. there was no significant difference between the AFST of environmental isolates and those of clinical isolates. e is a pathological disorder and a chronic inflammation in the sebaceous follicles. it is one of the most widespread dermatology problems and has affected millions of people worldwide. current Australian antibiotic therapeutic guidelines recommend that symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infections should be treated by removing or changing catheters and treating CAUTIs. the empirical antibiotic therapy for severe UTIs is intravenous gentamicin and amoxy/ampicillin. urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in people with spinal cord injury. probiotic therapy with combinations of Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 + Lactobacillus GR-1 (RC14-GR1) and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG + Bifidobacterium BB-12 (LGG-BB12) are effective in preventing UTI in people with SCI. patients randomised to LGG-BB12 also did not have a longer time to UTI than placebo. multivariable post hoc survival analysis for RC14-GR1 only vs. the other three groups showed a possible protective effect of RC14-GR1 only. this result would need to be confirmed in another study before clinical application. only 19% (12/64) indeterminate patients were treated with antibiotics. the average length of stay decreased by 5 days and the average length of diarrhoeal symptoms decreased by 1 day. future steps Further repeat evaluations should be utilised to ensure that this policy change is embedded in our Trust. new resistance mechanisms continue to emerge, making control of infection more difficult and more important than ever. the rapid spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is one of the most worrying examples. UHSM will continue to identify methods of decontaminating areas we are currently unable to reach with HPV. a new three-cloth cleaning method has been implemented, as well as using gel sheets to solidify waste water being disposed of in a macerator. the efficacy of the different superoxide water compositions available has been reported on planktonic micro-organisms. however, the efficacy of superoxide waters on biofilms is lacking. a range of clinically significant Gram-positive were exposed to a novel superoxide formulation in various non-biofilm models. antimicrobial studies evaluated on planktonic microbes demonstrated the new superoxide composition was a fast-acting and effective broad spectrum antimicrobial following a contact time of only a few minutes. the new superoxide formulation also demonstrated effective anti-biofilm activity on both mono-culture and polymicrobial immature and mature biofilms. dry biofilms were found to persist even after biocidal exposure. some biofilm recovery was observed with the colorimetric medium. results highlight that while the aim of eliminating dry biofilm is not achievable, a realistic approach may still involve making surfaces safe by controlling biofilm regrowth and by preventing transfer of micro-organisms. tAK activity was measured using ATP-luciferase assay in a benchtop luminometer. results provided a rapid and sensitive measure of the HPV process. both BIs and EIs were able to demonstrate sub-optimal HPV cycles. the anti-biofilm ability of this novel anti-biofilm formulation was determined on preformed young (24 h) and old (6 months) biofilms. the anti-biofilm activity was also evaluated on pure cultures of Acanthamoeba spp and also Acanthamoeba spp. study aims to assess current cleaning practices at four sites across the UK. likert-style and free-text questions were used to capture attitudes towards cleaning stethoscopes, current cleaning behaviours and potential suggestions to increasing stethoscope cleaning. only 7.5% of respondents clean their stethoscope in between every patient, and 11% of respondents have never cleaned theirs. six ED patient trolleys were selected from two acute University Hospitals. they were either prepared (n=3) or had just been cleaned (n=3) for a new arrival to the department. swabbed on a symmetrical 10\u201315 cm section of the handrail, trolley frame and head rest. swabbed on a symmetrical 10\u201315 cm section of the handrail, trolley frame and head rest. a combined detergent/disinfectant wipe was rolled out across three separate inpatient sites. a trial was held to evaluate compliance and staff views. areas chosen had been noted on audit to have poor compliance with equipment and medical device decontamination. the trust has purchased a new HCU to allow HCUs to be returned for manufacturer decontamination on a rotational basis. the HCUs have been located as far from the patient as possible. the proportion of air samples growing Mycobacterium sp. or overgrown with fungi was significantly lower after September 2015. staff on 4NW exclusively received instant feedback on the audit result. rooms and equipment were retested on three other occasions. results The percentage of cleaned surfaces improved incrementally on 4NW. champion initiatives address relevant IPC issues. an intranet page and specific email account has been established. champion initiatives address relevant IPC issues. paper selected were based on quantitative research, with findings expressed as numerical data. primary sources preferred over secondary sources, results and discussion Common themes were identified worldwide. the survey did identify areas of weaknesses which require further IPC support. this will allow the team to develop a more in-depth training programme to fit the needs of our CCU staff. a stage 4 prototype is now being developed with the intention of trialling by IPC managers during in-ward use. influenza vaccination has been shown to be effective at reducing the severity of illness and preventing death. the department of health has a vaccination policy for frontline workers within the NHS. a self-administered questionnaire was mailed to the 181 dental facilities who attended our infection control seminar. results We received a total of 74 responses (response rate 40.9%) of which 39 (52.7%) were from dentists, 24 (32.4%) from dental hygienists, 10 (13.5%) from dental assistants, and one (1.4%) from a pharmacist. 305 healthcare facilities, clinics, visit nursing stations, long-term care facilities, and public health centres were randomly selected. the response rate was 30.7%. of nursing schools, 86% conducted HBV, HCV, and the above ID antibody titre tests. about 60% carried out a tuberculin reaction test. the wheel is broken into four sections based on the transmission routes of the pathogens. each section is broken down into what PPE should be worn. correct removal of PPE is included due to contamination risks upon removal. seven standard precautions, four key topics and five specific infections. each section includes \u201ctest your knowledge\u201d questions. managers should keep the workbook as evidence of learning and a reference guide. DACC-coated dressings showed a significant reduction in SSI rates at 5 days post procedure. no statistically significant difference in SSI was seen beyond 5 days post procedure. no statistically significant difference in SSI was seen beyond 5 days post procedure. CS surgical site infection occurs in 11 to 18% of women in literature. 84% of infections occurring after hospital discharge. a dedicated SSI surveillance programme was developed in 2010. in the last 3 years there has been an unexplained increase in beta-lactam and glycopeptide resistance in our hospital. in 2011\u20132013, there were 26 glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus (GRE) cases while in 2014\u20132015 there were 60 GRE cases. the infection prevention and control team formed a group to facilitate the appropriate data collection. the group aimed to determine if SABs were avoidable or non-avoidable. all cases were reviewed to ensure they were managed in line with guidance on management of proven or suspected SAB in adults. the team monitors patients who have had knife-to-skin procedures. telephone questionnaires are completed at 30 days and the surveillance continues at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months if implants have been used. each SSI is categorised according to the published definition set by the centre for disease control (CDC) a number of initiatives have been put in place to address the lessons learned. the management of diarrhoea is included in the quality improvement \u201cVirginia Mason\u201d programme programme of education in the SIM lab. the most prevalent profession in charge of SSI surveillance was nurse (90%), followed by clinical microbiologist (75%), and medical doctor (60%). there was no association between hospital size (bed count) and whether the surveillance involved multiple professions or not. PDSA cycles have been used to evaluate and then disseminate interventions across the organisation. results have resulted in year-on-year reductions over the last 3 years. the work has resulted in year-on-year reductions over the last 3 years. preparation solution PVI 10% antiseptic Videne Antiseptic Solution 2% CHG in 70% Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) PVI 10% in 30% alcohol Videne Alcoholic Tincture 0.5% CHG in 70% ethanol Hydrex Pink/Clear BHIS CABG (n) SSI (n) SSI (n) SSI (n) SSI % CABG (n) SSI (n) SSI (n) SSI (n all cases of CRBSI are investigated using root cause analysis (RCA) and the learning shared with the Steering Group to action changes to practice. the rate of CRBSI fell from 5/1000 line days in 2011 to 0.6/1000 line days. the trust\u2019s \u201cBetter Care Together\u201d strategy states that changes will have to be made to existing facilities to ensure they are appropriate for 21st century health care. the team will be involved in capital planning, supporting refurbishments and new builds. most prevalent disease was bacterial vaginosis (29.7%) followed by candidiasis (24.7%) of the total candidal infections, 56% were caused by Candida albicans. Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei. phylogenetic analysis of 76% of toxin-positive and 63% of toxin-negative CDI cases was successfully sequenced. results and discussion Phylogenetic analysis of 76% of toxin-positive and 63% of toxin-negative CDI cases indicated that the majority of CDI cases in North Wales were unrelated to others. results Among 35 patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery, 20 received the preoperative CHG bathing (CHG group) and 15 did not (non-CHG group) the incidence rates of SSI for CHG and non-CHG groups were 5% and 26.7%, respectively. pooled mean incidence by birth-weight categories was 3.4, 1.5, 0.0, 2.2, and 2.1 per 1000 central line days for CLABSI; 1.5, 0.0, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.5 per 1000 ventilator-days for VAP. there were 39 CLABSIs, and 26 of them were identified by CSEP criteria. 16 patients in the silicon group were analysed. the mean durations of silver group and silicon group were 15.5 (SD 15.7) days and 18.3 (SD 17.9) days. incidence rates of CRC were 4.8% (silver group) and 0% (silicon group) respectively. 108 institutions participated in the pooled mean BSI rate per 1000 device-days. the pooled mean BSI rate per 1000 device-days was 1.7, with a median value of 2.2 (NHSN, pooled mean: 0.8, median value: 0). the pooled mean VAP rate was 3.7, median value was 3.4. in vitro release study confirms controlled release at dosages with significant antivirulence activity. further characterisations were performed using AFM, SEM and profilometer techniques. modified urinary catheter showed reduced bacterial load in implanted animals. the rate of CPE screening was compared using a Fisher\u2019s Exact Test. of 126 admissions, 71 (56%) were screened within 24 hours pre-intervention. of 126 admissions, 71 (56%) were screened within 24 hours pre-intervention. more than a year, a weekly oral fluid sample was arranged to monitor duration of virus excretion as a marker of infectiousness. a number of lessons learned are highlighted, including a reminder of the importance of the MMR vaccine for all women of child-bearing age. in April 2016, rubella susceptibility screening in pregnancy in England ended. risk factor-based screening of admissions for CPE was introduced in June 2015 to enhance universal screening of admissions to high-risk specialties. each CPE case identified and confirmed by PCR locally was sent to the reference laboratory for VNTR genotyping. control measures included high-quality hand hygiene, cleaning of equipment and ward environment. all outbreaks have been controlled. 67.9% of nurses, of which 54.7% were identified as carriers, had no knowledge about MRSA. there was a significant increase of nasal MRSA carriage as nurses work and get older. ongoing education should be provided to nurses, including an evaluation of sufficient knowledge and skills to come to a better point. the IPS Trent Branch has undertaken a census of the IPC workforce within the Trent region following the findings from the Centre for Workforce Intelligence review in July 2015. the survey included questions on the demographic data of IPC professionals, service provision, special interests, IPC activity, CPD opportunities and challenges faced by IPC professionals in the region. cost avoidance analysis was used to demonstrate avoided spend associated with bladder scanning. 526 adult in-patients were reviewed for catheter usage in the 2015 audit. 16% had a urethral catheter in situ. 5% of patients developed a CAUTI, which is a 71% reduction compared with 17% in march 2013. 70% of patients had a daily review by the nurse using the HOUDINI protocol compared with only 4% pre-implementation of HOUDINI. increased number of non-sanctioned cases has risen from 17% in the pilot year to 50% in 2015/2016. improvements will continue to be key in future developments and the aspiration to further reduce the number of sanctioned cases. in the year, the whole hospital is reviewed in this way. evidence of improvement Three hundred remedial works have been raised. a robust system for water safety is in place. the trust introduced environmental support workers to work in the Assessment Units. their role includes cleaning discharge bed areas, preparing beds for new admissions and transferring patients to the receiving wards. a \u201ctoolbox teaching\u201d session on antibiotics was devised and nurses were encouraged to sign up as Antibiotic Guardians. a series of six sessions were undertaken, each lasting 20\u201330 minutes. evidence of improvement Compliance prior to the intervention was 75\u201380%. following the intervention, compliance improved with scores of 85\u201390%. people were interested in C. difficile, from Board to Ward. if we hadn\u2019t changed, we would have been 10 over. future steps Continuing the \u201cBest Practice Express\u201d theme. intramuscular-administered KM results in erratic levels. differences in peak and trough levels have been observed between inpatient and outpatient treatment protocols. a review of protocols and procedures has commenced. new links with the discharge team have been built. new links with community and other hospitals have been built. the duration of urinary catheterisation is a major risk factor in the development of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) there is evidence that nurse-initiated catheter removal protocols significantly reduce the length of time catheters are in situ. the annual trust trajectory for patients developing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was exceeded by 48%. a comprehensive thematic analysis of these patients identified two key themes for improvement: prompt sampling and prompt isolation. five tests of change proved successful and were ramp up through the PDSA cycles. two wards were chosen for the 90-day collaborative. a project team including the Corporate Nursing Team, IPC, matron, ward manager and business administrator was formed. the two wards testing the chart were supported using the plan, do, study, act service improvement model. in 2014 the Trust experienced a rise in Clostridium difficile infection and MRSA colonisation Trust-attributable infections. this triggered a review of assurance around environmental controls. the average audit compliance has risen from 34% to 90%. this poster will demonstrate an effective method for sustained environmental controls addressing areas of modern healthcare environment not addressed through national tools. 171 patients tested for CPE between may 2015 and may 2016. only 92 patients were reported to IP&C to add to the database and alerts system. of the 92 reported cases, complete screens were completed on 53 (56%) patients. sepsis 6 protocol was implemented into our ED in 2014. it triggers an immediate senior doctor review and that doctor review determines whether the child requires sepsis 6 treatment. all children that present to the ED with an illness problem are screened. a baseline audit measured documentation of the HII actions on the anaesthetic charts of 50 consecutive patients who had cannulae inserted in theatre. the six HII actions for peripheral cannula insertion were documented in 1/50 patients (2%) prior to intervention and 26/50 patients (52%) post intervention. data gathered is entered directly onto a tablet device. the senior charge nurse (SCN) is sent an automated email. an automated email is generated in response to overdue actions. a scheduler is available via the platform to facilitate IPCT audit planning. 93 records were reviewed and 65.6% of high-risk cases were identified. all cases requiring screening had at least one sample submitted. only 11.1% had all required screening samples in accordance with policy. the IPC team found that after follow-up on action plans, GPs and GPDs achieved >95% compliance with the audit. the aggregated data provides an opportunity for shared learning across other primary healthcare providers. the final findings will summarise theories implemented within interventions. they will form a useful and practical guide for future research in this field. cancer is among the leading causes of death in the developed world. most people die from infection, not their disease. treatment for cancer including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and transplant leave a patient more vulnerable to infection than a healthy adult. a systematic review was conducted to identify national core components for IPC programmes. paper identified were screened against the eligibility criteria and further assessed according to cochrane\u2019s effective practice and organisation of care. 270-bed new state-of-the-art hospital was designed with the help of children and young people. majority of children and their families now have their own room with en-suite facilities with park views. the majority of children and their families now have their own room with en-suite facilities with en-suite facilities. the aim of this primary research study is to identify what factors promote or inhibit compliance with contact precautions in a NICU. the interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. handrubbing with 3 ml of ABHR for at least 30 seconds appears to yield the best results in antimicrobial efficacy. technique, level of compliance with protocol, ABHR volume, time and friction were all shown to influence the effectiveness of handrubbing. a graph will display the operating room hand hygiene audits results dated 2009\u2013current. a study tour to the University Hospital Zurich to learn how the fifth moment for hand hygiene has been defined in operating rooms is planned. there was a statistically significant increase in observed hand hygiene compliance overall to 91%, 95% CI (0.90\u20130.91), p 0.01 and an 18% increase in compliance amongst consultant staff, p 0.01. Discussion There is a statistically significant reduction in SSI, with infection rates being reduced by half. two settings were selected: a cardio-thoracic ward (CT) and a renal-haemodialysis unit (RH). a powered sample of 20 (nurses, healthcare support staff) from each unit (N=40) were each observed for up to 1 hour. the first 15 minutes of each observation were discarded to reduce limitations. research evidence suggests that hand hygiene compliance remains sub-optimal across various geographical locations and healthcare settings. the aim of this poster is to report the outcomes of a recent systematic review of peer-reviewed published studies on hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals. a series of dressing/undressing drills based on military chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear drills was adopted. staff perceptions, and what staff were prepared (and not prepared!) to do, remained a factor in planning. five suspect cases presented to the Trust. each was demanding on staff and resources. the average knowledge was significantly higher in respondents who had received health advice on MERS-CoV (56.92 18.55 vs. 44.91 25.46, p=0.001) the average knowledge was significantly higher in respondents who had received health advice on MERS-CoV. a total of 10 patients were found to be positive for MDR-Ab. patients were decolonised with octenidine-related products and colomycin. none of the staff members tested were found to be colonised. individual clinical teams utilised PJ prophylaxis in vulnerable patients. guidelines for prophylaxis/management and a policy/procedure for the prevention and control of PJP were written. all threats are risk assessed using a defined SOP (very high, \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d) to estimate potential impact on patients/services. threats assessed as moderate or greater are considered for action; for example, production of new guidance. hard copies of packs were sent to all care homes in south Gloucestershire and adapted for use in other south west localities. the project resulted in the creation of action cards and other outbreak management documents that advised on enhanced infection control precautions such as hand washing, use of personal protective equipment, environmental cleaning. 33% of cases developed PCP 5\u201315 years after transplant. discussions Prophylaxis for 6 months following transplant surgery and 6 months after rejection episodes may further reduce acquisition of PCP amongst renal transplant recipients. the epidemiology of this year's outbreak is still being studied to determine whether it was two outbreaks or two peaks. the epidemiology of this year's outbreak is still being studied to determine whether it was two outbreaks or two peaks. six patients in an acute ward were identified with Mycobacterium avium in their respiratory secretions during march 2016. the source implicated in this outbreak was an ice-making machine used for dispensing ice for patient consumption. the machine was decommissioned and back tubing was removed and sliced open to reveal the state of the lumen. the infection prevention and control team obtained more than 100 environmental swabs during an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae. the swabs were obtained using an ordinary swab and subjected to the \u201cmeropenem Gram negative resistant\u201d laboratory test using a CRE plate."}
