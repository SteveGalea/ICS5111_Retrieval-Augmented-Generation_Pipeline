{"summary": "paramyxoviridae consists of enveloped viruses with a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. the subfamily Paramyxoviridae comprises five genera: Rubulavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus. the only exception is the avian metapneumoviruses, which are classified in the genus Metapneumovirus APMV-2 and -3 have been reported to cause significant disease in poultry. pathogenic potential of serotypes 4\u20139 is generally unknown. genome of prototype APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 consists of 15,054 nt. the protein is synthesized as a precursor (F0) that is activated by cleavage by host cell protease into two disulfide-linked subunits F2-F1 [25]. virulent NDV strains typically contain a polybasic cleavage site [(R/K)RQ(R/K)RF] that includes the preferred cleavage site for furin [RX(R/K)R], which is an intracellular protease APMV-4 produces single-cell infections and does not cause syncytium formation that typically is a hallmark of paramyxovirus cytopathic effect (CPE) the importance of the F protein cleavage site in APMV-4 infectivity and pathogenicity was unclear. mutants exhibited protease independence, but syncytium formation and enhanced replication in vitro were observed only when a furin site was present. primary chicken neuronal cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS. modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara expressing T7 RNA polymerase was provided by NIAID. APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 was obtained from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa) the bird was anesthetized and killed by an overdose of isoflurane. sterile cotton gauze was placed in the bottom of a bell jar and was covered with a wire mesh. the bird was removed from the jar after cessation of breathing. the N and P ORFs were cloned individually into plasmid pTM-1. the L gene ORF was cloned into plasmid pGEM between AatII and XhoI sites. the full-length cDNA of APMV-4 in pBR322 and the L ORF in pGEM were sequenced in their entirety. two days after transfection, supernatant was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. recovery of the virus was confirmed by hemagglutination assay using 1% chicken red blood cells (RBCs) the presence of unique restriction enzyme sites was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. lysine residues at the -3 position in the cleavage site sequences of APMV-3 and APMV-5, respectively, were then introduced into rAPMV-4 (Table 1). these manipulations involved the MluI-NotI fragment noted above, and sequence analysis confirmed the absence of adventitious mutations. each of these mutant viruses was readily recovered, and the sequences of the F protein cleavage sites were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of recovered virus. pathotype definition: virulent strains, 60 h; intermediate virulent strains, 60 to 90 h; avirulent strains, >90 h. pathogenicity of NDV in 1-day-old SPF chicks following intracerebral inoculation. expression and Cleavage Efficiency of the F protein Incorporation of wild-type and mutated F proteins into the virions was analyzed by Western blot. growth characteristics of parent and mutant viruses were evaluated in DF1 and vero cells. plaques were fixed and immunostained using a previously-described antiserum raised against gel-purified APMV-4 virions. requirement for supplementation of exogenous protease for cleavage was determined by addition of either 1 g/ml of acetyl trypsin or 5% chicken egg allantoic fluid. five 9-day-old eggs per dilution were examined once every 8 h for 7 days. the ICPI is the mean of the score per bird per observation. virulent velogenic viruses give values approaching 2, and lentogenic strains give values at or close to 0. 2.7. 1-day-old chicks in groups of ten were inoculated with 0.05 ml of a 110 dilution of fresh infective allantoic fluid for each virus via the intracerebral route. two birds per group were sacrificed daily until 5 days post-infection. three birds per group were sacrificed at 4 dpi and collected for virus titration. tissue samples from the 2-week-old chickens were also inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the remaining three birds per group were observed daily for 14 days for any clinical signs. APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 was obtained from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa) all experiments involving experimental animals were approved by the committee of IACUC, University of Maryland (protocol number R-09-81) the bird was anesthetized and killed by an overdose of isoflurane. sterile cotton gauze was placed in the bottom of a bell jar and was covered with a wire mesh. the bird was removed from the jar after cessation of breathing. cDNA fragments containing the ORFs of the N, P, and L genes of APMV-4 were cloned individually into plasmid pTM-1 between NcoI and XhoI sites. the full-length cDNA of APMV-4 in pBR322, the N and P ORFs in pTM-1 and the L ORF in pGEM were sequenced in their entirety. a fourth plasmid encoding the full-length antigenome (5.0 g) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was infected with vaccinia MVA expressing T7 RNA polymerase at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell. the presence of unique restriction enzyme sites in the recovered virus was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. arginine and lysine residues at the -3 position in the cleavage site sequences of APMV-3 and APMV-5, respectively, were replaced with glutamine to yield the cleavage sites RPQGRF and KRQKRF. rAPMV-4 mutants containing the cleavage site from the avirulent NDV strain LaSota (GRQGRL), sendai virus (SV) and human parainfluenza virus pathotype definition: virulent strains, 1.5\u20132.0; intermediate virulent strains, 0.7\u20131.5; and avirulent strains, 0.0\u20130.7. 2.4. Expression and Cleavage Efficiency of the F Protein Incorporation of wild-type and mutated F proteins was analyzed by Western blot using an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide from the F protein of APMV-4. the cells were labeled with anti-peptide antiserum against the F protein of APMV-4 followed by anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody. the plaques were fixed and immunostained using a previously-described antiserum raised against gel-purified N protein of partially-purified APMV-4 virions. the requirement for supplementation of exogenous protease for cleavage of the F protein was determined by addition of either 1 g/ml a series of 10-fold dilutions of infected allantoic fluid (0.1 ml) was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of five 9-day-old eggs per dilution and incubated at 37\u00b0C. the eggs were examined once every 8 h for 7 days, and the time of embryo death was recorded. the ICPI is the mean of the score per bird per observation over the 8-day period. 1-day-old chicks in groups of ten were inoculated with 0.05 ml of a 110 dilution of fresh infective allantoic fluid for each virus via the intracerebral route. two birds per group were sacrificed daily until 5 days post-infection. two-week-old chickens in groups of six were inoculated with 200 l of each virus (256 HA units/bird) three birds from each group were sacrificed at 4 dpi and tissues samples (lung, trachea, spleen, and brain) were collected for virus titration. cDNA segments were synthesized by RT-PCR from virion-derived genomic RNA. the cDNA segments were cloned in a sequential manner into the low-copy-number plasmid pBR322/dr [6] between a T7 promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAGG) and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. APMV-4 replicates to high titer in embryonated chicken eggs than in cell culture. recombinant virus did not require exogenous protease during transfection and passage. previous observation that replication of biologically-derived wild-type APMV-4 is unaffected. rAPMV-4/Fc type 3-Q and rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q were readily recovered from these cDNAs. each of these mutants contained a glutamine residue in the -3 position. each of these mutants contained a glutamine residue in the -3 position. all of the recombinant viruses contained a similar pattern of the major structural proteins, suggesting that the various mutations of the F protein cleavage site did not affect virion assembly. analysis of proteins present in virions of parental and F protein cleavage site mutant APMV-4 viruses. the level of expression of the F protein by the rAPMV-4/Fc BC virus was 275% that of the parental viruses. most of mutant viruses also had similar levels of surface expression to those of the biological and recombinant parental viruses. rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q showed sporadic syncytium formation both in DF1 cells, but failed to produce distinguishable plaques. rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q showed sporadic syncytium formation both in DF1 cells, but failed to produce distinguishable plaques. the other four mutant viruses produced CPE that was characterized by single-cell infections, cell rounding, and detachment of virus-infected DF1 cells in six-well plates were infected with the indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell. the viral plaques in the infected cells were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining using antiserum against the N protein of APMV-4. rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q grew to titers of 5.0105 TCID50/ml at 24 hpi and 8.0104 TCID50/ml at 72 hpi. rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q replicated substantially better than other mutant viruses, reaching a maximum titer of 102 TCID50/ml. the growth kinetics of parental and recombinant APMV-4 viruses was determined by infecting DF1 cells with each virus at an MOI of 0.01 (A) and 1 (B) the viral titers were determined by limiting dilution on DF1 cells and immunostaining with antiserum raised against the N protein of APMV-4. pathogenicity of wild-type and mutant APMV-4 viruses was evaluated by the standard, internationally-accepted parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses were infected with the panel of viruses at an MOI of 0.1 PFU. the cells were fixed at 72 hpi, immunostained with antiserum against the N protein of APMV-4, and visualized by confocal microscopy. neurovirulent NDV strain BC was used as a control, and the expression of N protein by this virus was clearly detected in dendrites and axons. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, stained with antiserum against the N protein of APMV-4 followed by anti-Alexa Fluor 488 and 596. the neuronal marker and viral N protein stained red and green, respectively. two birds in each group were sacrificed daily until 5 dpi. brain tissue samples were harvested and virus titers were determined by limiting dilution in DF1 cells. each bar represents mean and standard error of the mean of duplicate samples. the tissue homogenates from the experiment with the 2-week-old birds were harvested from 4 dpi. replication of parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses was detected sporadically in the trachea from chickens infected with biologically-derived wild-type APMV-4. sporadic pattern indicated that replication in 2-week-old chickens was not significantly different between the parental and the various mutant APMV-4 viruses. groups of 2-week-old chickens were inoculated with each virus by the intranasal route. three birds from each group were sacrificed, and tissues samples were collected and homogenized. aliquots (100 l each) of the collected samples on 4 dpi was inoculated into three eggs, and allantoic fluids were collected on 3 dpi. parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses replicated with low systemic spread. chickens were inoculated with each virus (256 HA units) by the intranasal route. three-week-old ducks were inoculated by the combined intranasal and intratracheal routes with the various APMV-4 viruses. one half of each group was sacrificed at 4 dpi and tissue samples were collected for virus titration by limiting dilution in DF1 cells. rAMPV-4/Fc type 3-Q, rAMPV-4/Fc BC, and rAMPV-4/Fc SV were each detected in the 3-Q 0/3 2/3 1/3 rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q 0/3 2/3 1/3 0/3 rAMPV-4/Fc SV 0/3 2/3 2/3 0/3 rAMPV-4/Fc SV 0/3 2/3 2/3 1/3 rAMPV-4/Fc PIV 1 0/3 1/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 a group of 3-week-old ducks were inoculated with each virus by the combined intran deparaffinized sections of the virus-infected and uninfected control tissue were immunostained using antiserum against the N protein of APMV-4. the presence of antigens for most APMV-4 was detected in the trachea. in the lungs, viral antigens were mostly localized in the epithelium surrounding the medium and small bronchi. tracheitis with mild to moderate multifocal, lymphohistiocytic bronchointerstitial pneumonia with mild to moderate perivascular cuffing in the pulmonary interstitium. trachea sections showed moderate reactive lymphoid hyperplasia characterized by expansion of white pulp by reactive lymphocytes. presence of antigen (stained red) was detected for parental and mutant APMV-4. omic RNA with three extra G residues at its 5\u2032 end was readily recovered by transfection of the antigenome plasmid into HEp-2 cells together with plasmids encoding the N, P, and L proteins. rAPMV-4 was readily recovered by transfection of the antigenome plasmid into HEp-2 cells together with plasmids encoding the N, P, and L proteins. virus recovery was successful only with mutant containing the cleavage site sequence of NDV BC. the other two mutants could not be recovered in five different attempts. rAPMV-4 mutants were readily recovered from these cDNAs. mutant viruses were d five times in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. only two had furin motifs in the F protein cleavage site. protein composition of the wild-type and recombinant viruses was verified by coomassie blue staining. the separated proteins in the gel (8%) under reducing condition were transferred into a membrane. the F protein was detected by using an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide from the F protein of APMV-4. the effect of the cleavage site mutations on the surface expression of the F protein in DF1 cells was further evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. the cells were visualized 72 hpi by photomicroscopy directly. the ability of the viruses to produce plaques was tested on DF1 cells under 0.8% methylcellulose overlay. the two viruses did not produce plaques under methylcellulose overlay in the presence or absence of exogenous protease. Western blot analysis showed that the F protein of these two mutants was efficiently cleaved in DF1 cells. other mutants that did not produce syncytia showed incomplete cleavage of F protein. our results suggest that efficient cleavage of APMV-4 F protein is required for syncytium formation. cells were infected at low MOI of 0.01 in order to evaluate multi-cycle replication. rAPMV-4/Fc BC grew much better than any other mutant viruses. rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q also replicated substantially better than other mutant viruses. four mutant viruses replicated to maximum titers similar to parental viruses. increased in vitro replication of rAPMV-4/Fc BC and rAPMV-4/Fc type 5-Q correlated with the ability to form syncytia. the values of MDT and ICPI were identical to those of the parental APMV-4 viruses. none of the viruses caused the death of any of the chicken embryos within the standard 7-day time limit for assay. al cell cultures by collecting supernatants from the cultures at 12 h intervals and assaying for infectious virus by titration in DF1 cells. neurovirulent NDV strain BC was able to grow to 5.5 TCID50/ml at 72 hpi. none of the parental or mutant APMV-4 viruses, including rAPMV-4/Fc BC, were detected. titer on day 1 was not detected on subsequent days and did not cause disease or death during the 5 days of observation. there was no detectable disease or death, indicating that wild type APMV-4 does not replicate detectably in chicken brains. birds in each group were observed daily for a total of 14 days for any clinical signs and then sacrificed for virus titration of various tissues. a half of the birds in each group were sacrificed at 4 dpi and tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and brain) were collected for virus titration. Virus was not detected in any of the 14 dpi samples. clinical signs of illness were not observed in any of the infected groups. aliquots (100 l each) of the collected samples on 4 dpi was inoculated into three eggs. trachea infected with parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses exhibited mild lymphocytic tracheitis and mild multifocal mucosal attenuation. in general, lung sections exhibited mild to moderate, multifocal, lymphocytic to lymphohistiocytic bronchitis with minimal perivascular and parabronchial interstitial inflammation. these results suggest that parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses were avirulent chickens were inoculated with each virus (256 HA units) by the intranasal route. chickens were evaluated for virus-specific antibodies by a hemagglutination inhibition assay. 3.7. Replication of parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses was not detected. avage site mutant viruses were also detected in the trachea and lungs of one or two ducks per group. rAMPV-4/Fc type 3-Q, rAMPV-4/Fc BC, and rAMPV-4/Fc SV were each detected in the spleen of a single duck. tracheitis was mild to moderate lymphocytic tracheitis with mild to moderate multifocal mucosal attenuation and reduction of tracheal mucous glands. tracheal sections showed moderate reactive lymphoid hyperplasia characterized by expansion of white pulp by reactive lymphocytes. microscopic lesions were not found in the brain tissues. ducks were inoculated with each virus (256 HA units) by the combined intranasal and intratracheal routes. tissue samples were harvested on 4 dpi. the tissues were fixed with formalin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. in cell culture, this provides for intracellular cleavage without the need for exogenous protease. in vivo, these viruses replicate in most cell types and can cause systemic infection. in contrast, the cleavage site sequences of avirulent NDV strains characteristically have one or a few basic residues immediately upstream of the cleavage site. mutants were unable to recover mutants containing the cleavage sites of APMV-3 and APMV-5 (RPRGRL and KRKKRF), even though the latter was multi-basic and contained the furin motif. this last sequence had a glutamine residue in the -3 position, which typically is the case for NDV strains in general and also is the case for APMV-4. a number of these cleavage sites are associated with protease dependence in their respective native viruses. however, the ability to form syncytia in cell culture depended on the presence of a furin motif. however, the other cleavage site sequences did not confer syncytium formation in infected cells even after supplementation with allantoic fluid as a source of protease. avirulence of parental and mutant APMV-4 may be determined, at least in part, by their inability to infect neuronal cells. a furin cleavage site is cleaved efficiently by a protease that is only found in its natural host. it is possible that the avirulence of APMV-4 was due to its inability to replicate in neuronal cells. APMV-7 was changed by reverse genetics into mutants that included ones with furin cleavage sites. the changes did not increase the neurotropism of APMV-2 or APMV-7 in 1-day-old chicks or 2-week-old chickens. this indicated that the sequence at the F protein cleavage site is not a major determinant of neurotropism. parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses replicated somewhat better in ducks. sporadic for every virus, with virus being detected in the trachea and lungs, and in some cases the spleen, but without inducing any disease. ducks were more permissive than chickens, but the parental and mutant viruses remained highly restricted and avirulent even in ducks. further characterization of virus replication and pathogenicity using reverse genetics may enhance our understanding of overall APMV pathogenesis."}
