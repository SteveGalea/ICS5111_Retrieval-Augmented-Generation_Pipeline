{"summary": "the 350,000-ft2 research building houses the 29,931-ft2 vivarium. mice are used only within the facility, unless written IACUC approval is granted for outside-facility use. the program and facilities for animal care and use are fully AAALAC-accredited. ectromelia, rotavirus, papovavirus, Hantaan virus, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Clostridium piliforme, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi are integrated in the murine facility. the small animal imaging laboratory provides pronuclear microinjection services to generate transgenic or CRISPR/Cas9 founders and blastocyst microinjection. a 7-T MRI scanner (Varian, Agilent, Oxford, United Kingdom), 13C 15N 29Si hyperpolarizer (Oxford Hypersense), ultrahigh-frequency ultrasound imager (Vevo 2100, VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), several in vivo imaging systems. integral within the murine facility are a 137Cs -irradiator (JL Shepherd Associates, San Fernando, CA) and a 320-kV x a separate necropsy room is equipped with a fume hood, vented specimen storage, hematology and serum chemistry analyzers, and a 2-station, dual-draft murine necropsy workstation. each fully equipped procedural room is equipped with a fume hood, vented specimen storage, hematology and serum chemistry analyzers. cages can be used under either positive or negative pressurization and revert to static microisolation caging for approximately 72 h in the event of power failure. each pair of racks was ventilated and exhausted by a single AHU trolley. each trolley served 4 IVC rack sides (that is, 252 microisolators) aHP disinfects in 1 min, kills methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and norovirus. all surfaces, including animal transfer stations, biosafety cabinets, procedural countertops, gloved hands, core imaging equipment, and the external surfaces were decontaminated. ineffective efforts to VHP decontaminate IVC racks and AHU were'static\u2013open' VHP exposures, with AHU off, hose connections unsealed, and IVC rack plenums unassembled and unsealed. all subsequent equipment VHP decontaminations, during months 6 to 12 of the present report, were active\u2013closed VHP exposures. the program invested in additional IVC racks, hoses, and AHU to facilitate VHP decontamination routines. the flex room was equipped with sufficient IVC racks hose-connected to AHU set to the VHP cycle, for an active\u2013closed VHP decontamination. the next day, the flex room was sealed by using HVAC supply and exhaust vent covers and thimble covers. the flex room where assembled IVC racks connected to AHU were VHP exposed in the active\u2013closed setting, with AHU set to the VHP cycle, during months 6 through 12. all equipment required for a scheduled housing room change-out in its entirety was VHP decontaminated the day before. the next morning, murine occupied IVC racks were brought from the flex room to the VHP-decontaminated housing room and connected to AHU. all disposable porous materials were discarded, prefilters were changed in animal transfer stations and surfaces were sanitized by using OxivirTb. procedure rooms were VHP decontaminated with all supplies and equipment present, centrifuges open, biologic safety cabinet sashes raised, anesthesia induction boxes open, and all casework drawers and shelving exposed. PCR surveillance for C. bovis and Staphylococcus xylosus. ecal pellets of mice5 were submitted to a testing laboratory (IDEXX BioResearch, Columbia, MO) for C. bovis real-time PCR testing. assay targets a region of the 16S rRNA gene conserved among all C. bovis genomic sequences deposited in GenBank. an unconditional exact test was performed using the R 3.4 statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna Austria) the percentage of C. bovis PCR-positive specimens obtained during months 1 through 5 with those obtained during months 6 to 12 from either mice, equipment that was soiled, equipment that was sanitized, or equipment VHP that was exposed as either static\u2013open (that is, months 1 through 5). a P value less than 0.05 was considered to define a statistically significant difference 35% of the total housing space (green) and 30% of the procedural space (yellow) was PCR-positive for C. bovis (red X) the murine facility is SPF and viral-antibody-free and contains separate 6-room, 1593-ft2 quarantine area outside the vivarium proper. the mouse models core is a 303-ft2 laboratory that provides pronuclear microinjection services to generate transgenic or CRISPR/Cas9 founders and blastocyst microinjection and morula aggregation services. the small animal imaging laboratory provides 3D, high-resolution anatomic and molecular imaging in mice by using a 7-T MRI scanner. murine procedural space includes the Mouse Models Core, the Small Animal Imaging Laboratory, 3 procedural rooms in each of 3 housing-and-use suites. each of these procedural rooms contains class 2A2 biologic safety cabinets, anesthesia machines, surgical photomicroscopes, centrifuges, refrigerators, and a \u201380 \u00b0F freezer. IVC racks are sanitized through a 180 \u00b0F final rinse in a rack washer with dryer. clean IVC are stocked with bedding, reassembled, and clamped shut. clean IVC are stocked with bedding, reassembled, and clamped shut. each AHU trolley served 4 IVC rack sides (that is, 252 microisolators) each trolley served 4 IVC rack sides (that is, 252 microisolators) exhaust air was actively removed from the cage, not pushed out. y cabinets, procedural countertops, gloved hands, core imaging equipment, and the external surfaces of the occupied IVC were decontaminated by using VHP (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) with equipment left in place. effective equipment VHP sterilization requires an \u2018active\u2013closed\u2019 VHP exposure of IVC racks assembled, sealed, and connected to AHU set to the VHP cycle. IVC racks and AHU were VHP decontaminated during months 1 through 5 in the static\u2013open setting, such that AHU were off, hoses were disconnected, and rack plenums were unassembled. the program invested in additional IVC racks and AHU so that even the largest housing room could be completely changed out at once. the flex room was sealed by using HVAC supply and exhaust vent covers and thimble covers. the door was taped closed, and all equipment needed for the scheduled housing room change-out was VHP decontaminated. the next morning, this inventory of VHP-decontaminated racks, hoses, and AHU were used in the scheduled housing room change-out. the floor scrubber was run in the scheduled housing room and in the corridors between the scheduled housing room, the flex room, and the soiled side of cage wash. each occupied IVC rack in the scheduled housing room was disconnected from hoses, plenums capped, and taken to the flex room. soiled AHU in the scheduled housing room had their hoses capped, were sprayed with OxivirTb and prefilter change. the next morning, murine occupied IVC racks were brought from the flex room to the VHP-decontaminated housing room and connected to the AHU. all disposable porous materials were discarded, prefilters were changed in animal transfer stations, surfaces were sanitized by using OxivirTb. the next morning, murine occupied IVC racks were brought from the flex room to the VHP-decontaminated housing room. procedure rooms were VHP decontaminated with all supplies and equipment present, centrifuges open, biologic safety cabinet sashes raised, anesthesia induction boxes open, and all casework drawers and shelving exposed. PCR surveillance for C. bovis and Staphylococcus xylosus. the copy number estimate of C. bovis DNA for each PCR test was calculated by plotting the real-time crossing-point values from the C. bovis PCR assay on a standard curve of log-fold dilutions of a known copy number. swabs of airway interior surfaces were submitted to the testing laboratory (IDEXX BioResearch) for S. xylosus real-time PCR testing. a nonparametric test was used to compare C. bovis PCR copy numbers of specimens from months 1 through 5 with those from months 6 through 12. a P value less than 0.05 was considered to define a statistically significant difference. results The murine facility, at capacity, accommodates 62,496 mice in 15,624 IVC in 18 housing rooms. environmental PCR surveillance for C. bovis was broadly implemented to document facility-wide prevalence of C. bovis. effective aHP and VHP decontaminating procedures were developed October 2016 through February 2017. surfaces in 4 of 16 procedural rooms tested PCR-positive for C. bovis. of the IVIS 200 system (Perkin-Elmer), the imaging chamber of the Optix MX3 system (Advanced Research Technologies), the imaging chamber of the Optix MX3 system (Advanced Research Technologies), the imaging chamber of the FMT 2500 system (Perkin-Elmer), anesthesia induction box, the chamber of a biosafety cabinet, a procedural tabletop, and the tabletop of the hematology analyzer in necropsy were all PCR a 'Static\u2013open\u2019 indicates that AHU were off, and IVC rack plenums and hoses were disconnected. IVC rack plenums and hoses were connected to AHU b Total for months 1 through 5. a flex room was established for VHP exposures of portable equipment. all research and animal care staff were trained to use OxivirTb to saturate-spray all chamber surfaces prior to use, their gloves and sleeves, and the external surfaces of the occupied primary enclosure prior to use. improved AHU sanitizing methods were implemented with OxivirTb to ensure that all accessible surfaces had been cleaned prior to VHP exposure. ficient mice housing rooms, security card access was installed on the doors of 4 immunodeficient mice housing and use rooms during January 2017. one room limited to immunodeficient colony production and accessible to caretakers only, a second room limited to unidirectional immunodeficient mice housing and use and equipped with a dedicated IVIS 100 system. the third and fourth isolation rooms established as bidirectional isolation housing and use rooms from which immunodeficient mice were permitted to travel to common procedural areas within the murine facility. 0 (0%) of 12 murine specimens, 3 (1%) of 482 specimens from soiled IVC racks and AHU trolleys were C. bovis PCR-positive. 0 (0%) of 134 specimens from active\u2013closed VHP-exposed racks and AHU trolleys were C. bovis PCR-positive. facility-wide PCR surveillance for C. bovis on rack exhaust plenum interiors during may (month 8) found 0 (0%) of 56 specimens C. bovis PCR-positive. one strain of mice on a C57BL/6 background with a keratin promoter deficiency tested positive. 0 (0%) of 58 murine specimens and 0 (0%) of 447 equipment airway specimens were C. bovis PCR-positive during July and August 2017 (months 10 and 11) a single specimen from the benchtop of the procedural room from the June C. bovis recurrence tested PCR-positive for C. bovis. both the affected office and procedural rooms were again VHP decontaminated. no specimen derived from active\u2013closed VHP-exposed IVC racks and AHU trolleys tested C. bovis PCR-positive. no specimen derived from active\u2013closed VHP-exposed IVC racks and AHU trolleys tested C. bovis PCR-positive. a total of 4114 ft2 (35%) of the murine housing and use space and 4369 ft2 (15%) of the total 29,931-ft2 facility space became C. bovis contaminated during the 12-mo study. the entire facility was decontaminated by using a combination of 2 products new to the program, OxivirTb (an aHP) and VHP by using a commercially available generator and accelerator. monitoring by monthly C. bovis PCR assays the airways of all IVC racks and AHU. we also have implemented C. bovis PCR monitoring of procedural and personnel areas, C. bovis PCR monitoring of immunodeficient mice, and quarantine exclusion of C. bovis. 6 (12%) of 49 specimens from static\u2013open VHP-exposed airways were C. bovis PCR-positive during November 2016 through February 2017 (months 2 to 5). soiled IVC racks and AHU provided a safe niche for C. bovis survival in housing rooms. facility-wide PCR monitoring had not been implemented, and the extent of C. bovis contamination had not been determined. the present report demonstrates that critical to the eradication of C. bovis is the implementation of regular facility-wide environmental and murine C. bovis PCR surveillance to guide and direct regular facility-wide VHP decontamination. despite the absence of marked, wide-spread morbidity attributable to C. bovis, the agent can be harbored by a number of immunodeficient strains and is PCR identifiable among unaffected immunocompetent strains. david frum: a degree of granulocytic\u2013monocytic infiltration, associated dermal inflammation, and epithelial acanthosis may persist after hyperkeratosis is no longer clinically apparent we describe for the first time a comprehensive, systematic method of facility-wide C. bovis eradication using VHP decontamination. documenting the extent to which C. bovis dissemination occurs during an outbreak ensures agent eradication and diminishes concerns."}
