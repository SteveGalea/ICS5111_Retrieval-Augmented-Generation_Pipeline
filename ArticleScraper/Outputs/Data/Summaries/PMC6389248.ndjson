{"summary": "the infectivity of RSV on N2a neuronal cells and possible roles of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nucleolin (C23) during RSV infection were investigated. the results showed prolific RSV infection of N2a cells. strain can infect N2a neuronal cells, modulating expression of TLR4 and nucleolin, as well as TLR3, TLR7 and their downstream inflammatory factors. strain can induce co-localization of the RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin."}
