{"summary": "HBoV genomic DNA is frequently detected in both ill and healthy children. we hypothesize that spliced viral capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) produced during active replication might be a better marker for acute infection. children aged 18 years were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. 18 years were hospitalized with CAP and enrolled in the CDC EPIC study at primary children\u2019s hospital, Salt Lake City (Utah site), and at the Monroe Carell Jr Children\u2019s Hospital, Vanderbilt University, Nashville (one of the Tennessee sites). controls were excluded if they had fever or respiratory symptoms 14 days before or at enrollment, had received live attenuated influenza vaccine 7 days before enrollment, or were undergoing otolaryngologic surgery. HBoV VP1/VP2 capsid mRNA splice variant R6 (assay 1) was amplified using primer HBoV-L1 (0.25 M), an equimolar mix of primers HBoV-E3 and HBoV-E4 (1 M each) the 5 specimens from the Utah site with the greatest HBoV DNA load were tested for HBoV transcript R6 with and without a reverse transcription step. five specimens with the highest viral DNA load at the Utah site were tested with (red) and without (blue) reverse transcriptase (RT) only minimal cross-amplification was seen in the 3 specimens with the highest DNA load at levels that were 2.7 104\u20131.6 105-fold lower than the DNA loads in the corresponding specimens. spliced capsid HBoV mRNA, HBoV DNA and spliced capsid mRNA. spliced capsid mRNA was negative for HBoV. spliced capsid mRNA was negative for HBoV. spliced mRNA was negative for HBoV. controls were excluded if they had fever or respiratory symptoms 14 days before or at enrollment, had received live attenuated influenza vaccine 7 days before enrollment, or were undergoing otolaryngologic surgery. the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each institution and the CDC. HBoV types 1\u20134 amplified using primer HBoV-L1 (0.25 M), primer HBoV-E3 and HBoV-E4 (1 M each), probe HBoV-FAM1 (0.2 M; Supplementary Table 1), 5 L of total nucleic acid, and the QuantiTect Probe reverse transcription (RT)\u2013PCR kit (Qiagen; Figure 1A) HBoV Genomic DNA Detection and Quantification was amplified using an equimolar mix of primers HBoV-L3 and HBoV-L4 (0.25 M each), primer HBoV-E8 (1 M), and detection probe HBoV-FAM6 (0.2 M; Supplementary Table 1). specimens with a melting peak of 67\u00b0C were considered to have positive test results. ified analyses were conducted among patients who were positive for spliced capsid HBoV mRNA, positive for HBoV DNA and negative for spliced capsid mRNA, and negative for HBoV, using 1-way analysis of variance. the analyses were conducted using Stata 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and R 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) data for children with Community-Acquire Pneumonia (CAP) and Controls Enrolled at Utah and Tennessee Sites of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community Study Characteristic CAP Group (n = 1295) Control Group (n = 721) P Age, y 2 (1\u20136) 4 (1\u20139).001 Female sex 599 (46) 238 (33).001 Race Non-Hispanic white 677 (52) 583 (81). aincluded asthma or reactive airway disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression (due to a chronic condition or long-term use of medication, cancer [excluding skin cancer], neurologic disorder (including seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, and scoliosis), preterm birth (defined as a gestational age of 37 weeks at birth for children 2 years of age at the time of hospitalization), and HBoV capsid mRNA was detected year-round, with peaks that matched those observed for capsid mRNA. overall HBoV prevalence was lower at the Tennessee site (1.3% in patients and 0.3% in controls) than at the Utah site (2.7% in patients and 0.6% in controls) small numbers of HBoV capsid mRNA detections (3 of 133 patients and 1 of 229 controls; Supplementary Figure 2) in Tennessee. Sensitivity analysis of association of human bocavirus (HBoV) DNA and capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) detection with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) median mRNA load was 1.5 104 copies/mL in children with CAP and 1.3 104 copies/mL in controls. median viral loads were higher in those with CAP (6.8 102 copies/mL [range, 1 100\u20131.7 109 copies/mL]) than in controls (3.7 102 copies/mL [range, 8 100\u20138.4 108 copies/mL]; P.001). HBoV capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) and DNA load in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens from children with community-acquired pneumonia. median HBoV capsid mRNA load in children with CAP was similar to that in controls. median HBoV DNA loads were 100000\u20131000000-fold higher in capsid mRNA\u2013positive children with CAP (7.4 107 copies capsid mRNA\u2013positive children with CAP were younger (median, 1.3 years [IQR, 0.8\u20131.5]) than HBoV DNA\u2013positive children with CAP (median, 1.9 years [IQR, 0.9\u20135.9 years]; P =.01) or HBoV-negative patients (median, 4 years [IQR, 1\u20139 years]; P.01) study population Specimens were available from 745 children with CAP and 330 controls from Utah and from 550 children with CAP and 391 controls from Tennessee. controls were older than patients (median age, 4 years [interquartile range IQR, 1\u20139 years] vs 2 years [IQR, 1\u20136 years]; P.001) and were more likely to be male (67% vs 54%; P.001) conditiona 418 (32) 77 (11).001 Time from symptom onset to specimen collection, d 5 (3\u20138) NA Symptoms Fever 1189 (92) NA Cough 1210 (93) NA Dyspnea 887 (68) NA Abdominal pain 302 (23) NA Diarrhea 396 (31) NA Pathogen detection Virus 925 (71) 185 (26) HBoV genomic DNA was reproducibly detected at 10 copies per reaction. HBoV capsid mRNA was reproducibly detected at 100 copies per reaction. cross-amplification results in false-positive capsid mRNA levels. overall HBoV prevalence was lower at the Tennessee site (1.3% in patients and 0.3% in controls) than at the Utah site (2.7% in patients and 0.6% in controls) the association between HBoV capsid mRNA detection and CAP was not significantly different than for the entire cohort. atic controls and patients enrolled after January 2011 for Utah and after February 2011 for Tennessee patients. asymptomatic analysis is limited to controls confirmed to remain symptom free for 14 days. numbers indicate the size of each group, given the different stratifications. median viral loads were higher in children with HBoV genomic DNA. median HBoV DNA loads were 5\u20136 orders of magnitude higher for capsid mRNA\u2013positive children with CAP. median HBoV capsid mRNA load was approximately 2-fold higher in children with CAP (622 copies/mL) than in controls. CAP, as well as 2 controls, had HBoV DNA loads of 1 106\u20131 109 copies/mL. median HBoV DNA loads were 100000\u20131000000-fold higher in capsid mRNA\u2013positive children with CAP. HBoV DNA loads were similar in capsid mRNA\u2013negative patients and controls. monia, Stratified by Human Bocavirus Capsid Messenger RNA (mRNA) and DNA Detection Patterns Characteristic mRNA Positive (n = 27) mRNA Negative (n = 112) HBoV Negative (n = 1157) Age, y 1.3 (0.8\u20131.5) 2.0 (1.0\u20135.8) 2.6 (1.0\u20136.8) Female sex 11 (41) 56 (50) 532 (46) Symptom onset to specimen collection, HBoV prevalence at the Tennessee site was approximately 3-fold lower than at the Utah site. the strength of the association between HBoV and CAP was similar at both sites and consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. HBoV genomic DNA was not significantly associated with CAP after adjustment for age, season, and codetection of other pathogens. HBoV can be shed for up to 12 months and can be reactivated upon infection with other pathogens. detection of genomic HBoV DNA alone is not likely to be suitable to identify acute and clinically relevant infections. viremia has been detected during acute infections in some studies but has not been widely studied. incident infections, defined as infections involving primary shedding of HBoV DNA, are associated with respiratory symptoms in infants. a recent longitudinal study by Martin et al demonstrated that incident infections, defined as infections involving primary shedding of HBoV DNA, are associated with respiratory symptoms in infants. oV capsid mRNA was also correlated with higher viral DNA loads in both the present and previous studies. this large, prospective, multicenter case control study expands on the previous study by confirming a stronger association of HBoV capsid mRNA detection with CAP. RT-PCR detection of HBoV capsid mRNA can be more easily implemented for epidemiologic studies. children were enrolled in the EPIC study during a 30-month period so that this study only covered 3 respiratory seasons. despite the size of the EPIC study, we only detected 27 patients with HBoV mRNA (2.1% prevalence), potentially leading to small-sample-size bias.
