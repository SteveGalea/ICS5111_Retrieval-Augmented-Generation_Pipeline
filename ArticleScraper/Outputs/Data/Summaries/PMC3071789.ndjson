{"summary": "PHEV predominantly affects 1-3 week-old piglets[1], with clinical piglets vomiting, exhaustion and obvious neurological symptoms as the main feature. the mortality rate is up to 20-100%[2]. since 1958, when the disease broke out in the Canadian province of Ontario for the first time[3], many countries have reported about it. the hemagglutinin- esterase gene of PHEV strains was amplified by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequenced. the homology and phylogenetic analyses were done between the group 2 coronaviruses and influenza C virus strains downloaded from Genbank. the diseased pigs were dissected and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid. pathological examination was used to assess the lesions. brain, spinal cord, heart, lung, liver, kidney and other tissues were used for paraffin-embedded sectioning. a phylogenetic tree derived from deduced amino acid sequences was constructed for the PHEV using the bootstrapped maximum parsimony method of MEGA version 4.0 [9] mice were randomly divided into five groups of two mice each; one group was set as the control group. piglets were all 20 days old and had not been immunized with any vaccines. clinical signs were vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions and obvious neurological signs. they died within three days of submission. RT-PCR was performed under standard conditions using virus-specific primers. classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) were selected for further analysis by multiplex PCR. a phylogenetic tree derived from deduced amino acid sequences was constructed for the PHEV using the bootstrapped maximum parsimony method. mice were inoculated with isolated viral strain from PK-15 cell culture. mice were randomly divided into five groups of two mice each. 28 piglets died within 20 days of birth. the only 10 surviving pigs were sent to our lab to be raised separately. their clinical signs were significant increase of body temperature, lethargy and crowding together. all diseased pigs showed meningeal hyperemia, cortical hyperemia and cortical venous congestion. the spleen was slightly enlarged. there were no significant changes in other organs. hemagglutinin-esterase gene of the isolate PHEV-JLsp09 strain was sequenced. it contained a T to G replacement at position 1172 and a T to C replacement at position 1271, indicating that the piglets were infected by a HEV infection. the major clinical manifestations included lethargy, loss of appetite, taking a dog-sitting position, hair-bristling, arched back, grasping the mouth or the head with the forelimbs, waving the forelimbs up and down. mice in the control group did not show any clinical signs. the only 10 surviving pigs sent to our lab died within 3 days. the death rate of the piglets was 100%; the death rate of the piglets was 100%. pigs showed meningeal hyperemia, cortical hyperemia and cortical venous congestion. microscopic lesions Cortical blood vessels were slightly dilated. there was neuronal edema in the pyramidal and polymorphic cell layers and the peripheral space increased. phylogenetic analysis shows that PHEV-JLsp09 strain may originate from the HEV-67N strain. hemagglutinin-esterase gene of the isolate PHEV-JLsp09 strain was sequenced. hemagglutinin-esterase gene of the strain was sequenced. histopathological examination of infected mice showed typical changes for non-suppurative encephalitis. the cerebral cortical neurons were swollen (H&E, 400; bar = 100 m) s of imported landrace, duroc, and Hampshire pigs was the first case reported in mainland china[11]. the viral strain isolated may be a mutated strain of HEV-67N, which was brought by the imported pigs and then spread and mutated in native pigs. vomiting is caused by viral replication in the vagal sensory ganglia. this outbreak of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis in a pig farm follows a specific pattern. the disease occurred in the early and middle birth period of first litter gilts. some piglets born during the middle and late birth period did not have the disease.
