{"summary": "using rotavirus as a model system, we developed a cell-based, moderate-throughput screening (MTS) assay to identify compounds that reduce rotavirus infectivity in vitro. the assay is adaptable to other virus systems, and amenable to full automation and adaptation to a high-throughput format. innate immune agonist, rapid and quantitative assessment of activity and toxicity in cell culture are prerequisite to lead compound development. cell-based screening assays that test for compounds active against hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and SARS coronavirus use recombinant viruses and changes in reporter gene expression in engineered cell lines to measure antiviral activity. a natural product library consisting of 280 compounds derived from plant extracts was screened. several compounds that inhibited rotavirus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner were identified. development of such a platform to screen compounds for the ability to diminish virus replication easily can be applied. the data shown in figure 1 illustrate the range of increase in chemiluminescent signal that corresponds with increasing infectious units in a 10-1/3 virus dilution series. changes in the magnitude of the enzymatic signal accurately reflect changes in the number of infectious units measured by IF. infections allowed to proceed for 18 hours and chemiluminescent measurement of reduction in rotavirus infectivity was performed as described in the text and in the legend to Figure 1. Error bars are standard errors of the means. assay validation Plate uniformity assessments were performed according to the recommendations of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center. 280 compound natural product library was screened to identify compounds that reduced rotavirus infectivity. forty-seven (17%) compounds were selected for a second round of screening. the highest concentration of mangostin was toxic under this assay. ten compounds did not reduce infectivity above the established threshold in the second round, generating a true false positive hit rate of 20%. the remaining 15 compounds were designated true hits (5 %). phytohormone -Cytokinin -Antiviral activity against Tobacco Mosaic Virus [29] -Causes decrease in (poly rI) stimulated interferon response in VSV challenged mice [30] -Reverses effect of endotoxin-enhanced host resistance [31]. antibacterial activity against E. coli, Staph. aureus and Myc. smegmatis [36] -Antimalarial activity [37] TNP00231 Isopimaric Acid 302.46 Diterpene -Inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus [38] -activates large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel -subunit [39] TNP00006 each time point was assayed in triplicate and virus was quantified by counting FFU. open squares are IFN control; red, 7.5 g/ml, blue, 5 g/ml, and green, 2.5 g/ml. the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (n = 3). IL-8 expression cells were treated with indicated compounds for 24 hours. ELISA-based assay successfully measured neutralization of rotavirus infectivity. changes in the magnitude of the enzymatic signal accurately reflect changes in the number of infectious units measured by IF. cells were infected with 10-1/3 serial dilutions of rotavirus for 18 hours. plates were fixed and probed with anti-VP6 mAb A6M. the Z' coefficient was established with mock infected cells representing the minimum signal value, virus infected cells representing the maximum signal value, and the IFN/IFN mixture as the midrange signal. experiments consisting of three plates each run on three consecutive days were performed. compounds from a natural product library reduce rotavirus infectivity. 280 compound natural product library was screened to identify compounds that reduced rotavirus infectivity. forty-seven compounds were selected for second round of screening. ten compounds did not reduce infectivity above the established threshold in the second round, generating a true false positive hit rate of 20%. the remaining 15 compounds were designated true hits (5 %) and are listed in Table 1. group B TNP00307 Kinetin-9-Riboside 347.33 Phytohormone -Cytokinin -Antiviral activity against Tobacco Mosaic Virus [29] -Reverses the effect of endotoxin-enhanced host resistance [31]. resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus [38] -activates large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel -subunit [39] TNP00292 Parthenolide 248.32 Sesquiterpene Lactone -inhibits NFB activation by preventing induction of IB kinase [40] TNP00006 Unknown 358.48 TNP00014 Unknown 388.50 Time course of inhibitory y-axis represents percent inhibition and the x-axis is time of infection. -mangostin and 18 -glycyrrhetinic acid activate NFB and induce IL-8 secretion. il-8 secretion was measured following each treatment. we screened a library consisting of 280 natural products purified from plant extracts. several compounds were identified that reproducibly inhibited rotavirus replication without cytotoxicity. the assay has been validated statistically and by the observation that compounds selected for further study were purchased from different sources. the majority of compounds called a hit in the screen for which data is available has been previously described to affect inflammatory or anti-inflammatory gene expression or pathogen growth in vitro. there has been a resurgence of interest in natural products as drug candidates for a variety of reasons including increased interest in infectious disease prevention and therapy. the compounds we chose for follow-up studies all have an inhibitory effect on either synthesis or release of PGE2. the ability of -mangostin and 18 -glycyrrhetinic acid to inhibit rotavirus replication when both compounds activate NFB is most likely because antiviral states are established upon treatment of the cells with each compound. monoclonal antibody (MAb) E4 reacts with major structural protein VP6 of most group A rotavirus strains [23] monoclonal antibody (MAb) E4 reacts with major structural protein VP6 of most group A rotavirus strains. 280 natural products purified from plant extracts were purchased from TimTec.
