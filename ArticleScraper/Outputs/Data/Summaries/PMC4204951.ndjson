{"summary": "antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are conquering special attention as therapeutic alternatives. AMPs are universal features of the defense systems of all forms of life. studies about antiviral compounds date from 1950 (Felipe et al., 2006), but for several reasons such as serious side effects, just a few drugs were approved for clinical use. the peptide was produced as described elsewhere (Motta et al., 2007b) the peptide was stored at 20 \u00b0C until used for antiviral assays. aldrich supplemented with 10% of bovine fetal serum (BFS, Gibco, USA), penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), streptomycin (Vetec, Brasil), amphotericin B (Crist\u00e1lia, Brasil) and enrofloxacin (Bayer, Brasil) the antiviral activity of the AMP P34 was evaluated against viruses with different phenotypic and genotypic features the cytotoxicity of P34 was expressed as the concentration at which 50% cytotoxicity was observed (CC50) antiviral assays Cytopathic effect inhibition (CPE) assays were performed on confluent MDCK, CRFK and RK13 cell monolayers, in the presence or absence of P34 in its non-cytotoxic concentration for each cell lineage. the peptide was stored at 20 \u00b0C until used for antiviral assays. the antiviral activity of the AMP P34 was evaluated against viruses with different phenotypic and genotypic features. Cytotoxicity assays MDCK, CRFK and RK13 cells grown in microplates (TPP, Switzerland) were incubated with different concentrations of P34 (from 0,23 g/mL to 6,87 g/mL) for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. cell viability measured by the neutral red dye uptake (NRU, Vetec, Brasil) assay. virucidal effect Virus strains were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h with E-MEM in the presence or absence of P34. after the incubation period, the infectivity was immediately determined by virus titrations on cell cultures. m/z peaks at 1449.8, 1463.8 and 1477.8 differed by 14 Da. other peaks corresponding to Na+ and K+ adducts of fengycin were also observed. the titer of EAV was expressively reduced from 107 TCID50 to 101,75 TCID50 in the presence of P34, presenting a PI of 99.9%. the peptide P34 had only a direct inactivating effect against EAV infectious particles. the peptide was evaluated on MDCK, CRFK and RK13 cells. CC50 values were 2.11 g/mL, 2.5 g/mL and 3.92 g/mL for MDCK, CRFK and RK13 cells. the peptide P34 had only a direct inactivating effect against EAV infectious particles. after 6 h of incubation, EAV titer was reduced from 104.5 TCID50 to 102.75 TCID50 in the presence of P34. cationic antimicrobial peptides are very rare. they are found in all species and are potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents. some peptides have demonstrated their ability to kill rapidly a broad range of microorganisms. peptide P34 interferes with adsorption, penetration or viral replication. blocking viral entry may occur by specific interactions with cellular receptors. heparan sulfate is the most important glycosaminoglycan molecule associated with to herpesvirus attachment to host cells. eritis causes severe economic losses to the equine industry, there is no specific treatment. a remarkable feature of the members of this family is their ability to cause and reactivate latent infections in their hosts. most used in the human medicine are the nucleoside analogues. peptide P34 showed antiviral activity against EAV and FHV-1. no antiviral activity was detected against CAV-2, CCoV, CDV, CPV-2, EIV and FCV."}
