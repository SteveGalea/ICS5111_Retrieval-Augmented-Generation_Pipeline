{"summary": "adenosine deaminase catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine. ADA, EC 3.5.4.4, catalyzes the deamination of adenosine. ADA1 is a monomeric enzyme that plays a central role in purine metabolism. interest in ADA function increased after the discovery that about 15% of inherited immunodeficiencies are caused by mutations in the ADA gene that lead to a loss of function of this protein. ADA is a cytosolic enzyme localized in many human tissues. str\u00f6m (2005) showed that the abundance of this enzyme in human tissues is low and that the gene encoding ADA2 is part of a new family of adenosine deaminase growth factors. it has been demonstrated that ADA can also be expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of several cell types. ADA, caveolin-1 and many monoclonal anti-CD26 antibodies bind to the glycosylation-rich domain. plasminogen, fibronectin, collagen and streptokinase bind to the cysteine-rich region. soluble monomeric form of CD26 has been reported in plasma and other body fluids. CD26 has a number of non-enzymatic functions via interactions with several proteins. the second type of ADA anchoring proteins on the cell surface are the A1R (Ciruela et al., 1996; Saura et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2005; Gracia et al., 2011, 2013a) and the A2BR (Herrera et al., 2001; Antonioli et al., 2001; A1R is coupled to Gi/o proteins, while A2AR and A2BR are coupled to Gs/olf proteins. A2AR and A2BR have a stimulatory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity increasing cyclic AMP levels. we have investigated if ADA could function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A2AR present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. the results obtained confirm that the cloned A2AR-NanoLuc and CD26-YFP constructs express correctly in HEK cells. amplified fragments were subcloned to be in-frame with restriction sites of pRluc-N1, Nluc or pEYFP-N1 vectors. plasmids express proteins fused to YFP on the C-terminal end (CD26-YFP) or on the N-terminal end (NMDAR1A-Nluc, A2AR-Nluc) with and without spacer (GTAGTGCCA) plasmid pZC11-containing TAC-promoted wild-type human ADA cDNA. overnight cultures of pZC11-hADA transformants of S3834 were inoculated. cells were grown with shaking at 37\u00b0C until an A600 nm = 1.0. adenosine deaminase activity was determined at 25\u00b0C with 0.1 mM adenosine as substrate in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. the decrease in the absorbance at 265 nm was monitored in an Ultrospec 3300 pro spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) transfection human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 g/ml sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (1/100) and 5% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. cells were incubated with the corresponding protein cDNA cells were labeled with the primary mouse anti-A2AR antibody (1:200; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany; cat #05-717) for 1 h to detect A2AR\u2013Nluc, washed, and stained with the secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300; Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom; cat #A-11001) the level of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was determined in equivalent amounts of protein (10 g) separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel. membranes were then probed with a mixture of a mouse anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 antibody (1:2500, Sigma) and rabbit anti-ERK 1/2 antibody (1:40,000, Sigma) for 2\u20133 h. the assay was carried out according to Vials et al. (2015). cells were seeded in 384-well microplates at a density of 10,000\u201312,000 cells per well. for the assay, cells were washed twice with assay buffer (HBSS with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.15) and incubated for 2 h. fluorescence at 665 nm was analyzed on a PHERAstar Flagship microplate reader. readings were collected using a Mithras LB 940 late reader. bioluminescence readings were performed after 10 min of adding 5 M of coelenterazine H. the net BRET was defined as [(long-wavelength emission)/(short-wavelength emission)]-Cf where Cf corresponds to [(long-wavelength emission)/(short-wavelength emission)] for the receptor-Nluc expressed alone in the same experiment. membrane suspensions were incubated for 2 h at 25\u00b0C with a constant free concentration of 2.2 nM of the antagonist [3H]ZM 241385 (50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, United States) in the absence or in the presence of bovine ADA, membranes were also incubated with 2.2 nM [3H]ZM 241385. the model analyzes the interactions of the radioligand with a competing ligand. it provides the affinity of the competing ligand for the first protomer in the unoccupied dimer (KDB1) and the affinity of the competing ligand for the second protomer when the first protomer is already occupied by the competing ligand (KDB2).

ADA bridges CD26 and A2AR in a narrow range of concentrations. the optimal ADA concentration required to observe the ternary complex is around 1\u20133 g/ml. this is in agreement with the affinity constants of ADA to bind to these two proteins. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 2 g of CD26-YFP cDNA (A\u2013D) or 2 g of NMDAR1A-YFP cDNA (C) cells were incubated 10 min without shaking with HBSS in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of ADA (from 0.01 to 10 g/ml) (A), in the presence or in the absence of 1 g/ml of bovine ADA (B, -293T cells were incubated with medium (0), with 1 g/ml bovine ADA, with 1 g/ml albumin as non-specific protein or with bovine ADA plus 0.3 g/ml of the human-specific mAb against CD26, TA5.9-CC1-4C8. positive nanoBRET signal was only significantly detected in the presence of ADA but not in the presence of albumin or ADA plus TA5.9-CC1-4C8 the specific enzyme activity of leu58Ala and leu62Ala ADA mutants is highly reduced respect to the wild-type enzyme. both mutants are unable to significantly affect agonist binding to A2AR.

WT, control wild-type ADA; PR, purine riboside; ND, not detected. $EC50 value is the amount of wild-type or mutant ADA that is able to produce the 50% of the maximum increase in binding to A2AR. A2AR and CD26 are not represented as homodimeric proteins. ADA-mediated molecular interaction between A2AR and CD26 is investigated. this paper has been extensively validated to analyze direct protein\u2013protein interactions occurring in living cells. HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of cDNA for A2AR-Nluc or A2AR-Nluc-spacer. all fusion proteins were expressed and A2AR-Nluc-spacer was better expressed compared to A2AR-Nluc, reaching expression values similar to those obtained for common Rluc fused at the C-terminus domain of A2AR. results are given in relative bioluminescence units by subtracting the value of non-transfected cells and represent mean SEM (n = 10). Statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test; p 0.001 against A2AR-Nluc. cDNA corresponding to A2AR-Nluc (Figure 2A), A2AR-Nluc-spacer (Figure 2B) or A2AR-Rluc (Figure 2C) was obtained against time. the signal was similar to the signal obtained for common A2AR-Rluc construction. assays were performed in HEK-293T cells transfected with cDNA (1.5 g) corresponding to A2AR-Nluc (A) or A2AR-Nluc-spacer (B) both fused on the N-terminal end or A2AR-Rluc fused on the C-terminal end (C) cells were stimulated with vehicle (basal) or with increasing concentrations of the A2AR agonist CGS 21680. membranes from HEK-293T cells transfected with cDNA corresponding to A2AR-Nluc-spacer were incubated with increasing concentrations of ADA. ADA enhanced in a dose-dependent manner the antagonist binding to both A2AR non-fused and fused to NanoLuc-spacer. the EC50 values obtained with the two proteins are not significantly different. competition experiments of 2.2 nM [3H]ZM 241385 binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ZM 241385 were performed using membranes from HEK-293T cells transfected with A2AR-Nluc-spacer cDNA (1.5 g) data are mean SD from a representative experiment (n = 3) performed in triplicate. r- 90 20 0 A2AR-Nluc-spacer + 30 10 0 Dose-response Bovine ADA A2AR-Nluc-spacer 14 8 A2AR 4 2 Competition curves with ZM 241385 in the absence (-) or the presence (+) of bovine ADA. ADA exerts positive modulation on the A2AR-Nluc-spacer signaling similar to the one reported for the nave receptor. ADA mediates cell to cell contacts by simultaneous binding to A2AR in one and to CD26 in another cell. both cell populations were mixed in the presence and absence of ADA. ADA bridges CD26 and A2AR in a narrow range of concentrations. the optimal ADA concentration required to observe the ternary complex is around 1\u20133 g/ml. this is in agreement with the affinity constants of ADA to bind to these two proteins. cells were incubated 10 min without shaking with HBSS in the absence or in the absence of increasing concentrations of ADA (from 0.01 to 10 g/ml) (A), in the presence or in the absence of 1 g/ml of bovine ADA (B,C), bovine albumin (1 g/ml) (B), human-specific mAb against CD26, TA5.9-CC1-4C8 (0.3 g/ml) (B) or in positive NanoBRET signal was only significantly detected in the presence of ADA but not in the presence of albumin or ADA plus TA5.9-CC1-4C8. ADA specifically mediates A2AR-CD26 interaction between different cells. ADA mutations nearly to the catalytic site also reduce the capacity of ADA to interact with A2AR. the specific enzyme activity of leu58Ala and leu62Ala ADA mutants is highly reduced respect to the wild type enzyme. both mutants are unable to significantly affect agonist binding to A2AR. ADA could act as a bridge simultaneously interacting with A2AR and CD26 expressed in different cells. 62A ND 0.074 106 >1000 0 >1500 Wild-type and mutant enzymes were partially purified as indicated in Materials and Methods. $EC50 value is the amount of wild-type or mutant ADA that is able to produce 50% of the maximum increase in [3H]CGS 21680 binding to A2AR. extracellular adenosine plays an important role in intercellular signaling by binding to ARs on the cell surface. most of the extracellular adenosine comes from the release and metabolism of adenine nucleotides such as ATP. ecto-ADA requires cell-surface anchoring proteins to stay joined to the plasma membrane. two hydrophobic loops protruding from the -propeller domain of CD26 interact with two hydrophilic and strongly charged -helices of ADA. binding of CD26 does not block the active site of ADA; conversely, binding of CD26 does not block the active site of ADA. this indicates that CD26 and ADA remain catalytically active upon the complex formation. the binding of ADA to CD26 can be relevant in the regulation of lymphocyte and epithelia cell adhesion. it has been reported that the binding of ADA to CD26 can be relevant in the regulation of lymphocyte and epithelia cell adhesion. receptors A1R, A2AR, and A2BR are the second type of ecto-ADA binding proteins. the receptors are highly expressed in spleen, thymus, blood platelets, striatum, olfactory tubercle and expressed to a lesser extent in the heart, lung, blood vessels and other brain regions. ADA acts as an allosteric modulator of A1R and A2AR. the ADA-induced molecular rearrangement in the corresponding receptor structure is in good agreement with the ADA-promoted increase in agonist-induced signaling and ligand affinity for both A1R and A2AR. we demonstrated a direct molecular interaction between ARs, specifically A2AR, and CD26 bound by ADA using biophysical techniques. this is compatible with a macromolecular complex in which A2AR and CD26 are bridged by ADA. this is compatible with a macromolecular complex in which ADA and CD26 are bridged by ADA. lower concentrations are insufficient to bridge the trimer and higher ADA concentrations favor the dimeric ADA-CD26 and ADA- A2AR complexes. soluble CD26 could interfere with this role of ADA in many pathological conditions, such as obesity and several viral infections. ADA can increase binding of the ligand to ARs in the absence of adenosine. alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that the two amino acid regions that participate in the structural gate of the active site pocket play a central role in ADA catalysis. mutations of the hydrophobic residues Leu58 and Leu62 produce a 100-fold decrease of the catalytic efficiency, because they decrease both the maximum velocity and the substrate affinity. ecto-ADA may participate in cell to cell contacts (CD26/ADA/CD26; CD26/ADA/A1R and A1R/ADA/A1R) which can be of relevance in neural functionality and development. ecto-ADA anchored to CD26 could direct interaction between T cells and ARs-containing cells, such as neurons, DCs, and so on. the bridge in the ternary complex is neither produced by a non-specific protein as albumin or between A2AR and another membrane protein different of CD26. this fact could allow a physiological cell-cell adhesion between DCs or neurons that express A2AR. this fact could allow a physiological cell-cell adhesion between, for example, DCs or neurons that express A2AR. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
