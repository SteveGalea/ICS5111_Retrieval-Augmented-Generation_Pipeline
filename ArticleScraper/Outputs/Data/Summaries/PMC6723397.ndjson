{"summary": "capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, Linnaeus 1766) are the world\u2019s largest rodent. their semi-aquatic habit requires the presence of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and lagoons. proximity of capybara habitats to humans and domestic animals in urban areas can facilitate the zoonotic spread of pathogens such as Rickettsia rickettsii. eukaryotic-infecting circular replication associated protein encoding single-stranded CRESS DNA viruses are distantly related to prokaryotic infecting ones. a total of 201 viral genomes were identified; 164 span four known viral families and 37 are part of the unclassified CRESS DNA virus group. the faecal pellets were homogenised in an SM buffer. the pellets were centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm. the pellets were then resuspended in 1 mL of SM buffer. PCR was performed using HiFi HotStart DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) the amplified genome sequences were resolved in a 0.7% agarose gel. the expected size amplicons were gel-excised and purified using the Quick-spin PCR Product Purification Kit. a dataset of the major capsid protein (MCP) of the microvirus sequences available in GenBank was assembled (MCP_all) both Rep_all and MCP_all were separately clustered with a 0.9 sequence identity cut-off using CD-HIT [28] for the Rep analysis, a representative from each cluster and all the Reps encoded by the viruses (except microviruses) identified in this study. the cyclovirus ML phylogenetic tree was rooted with the representative sequences of the unclassified CRESS DNA group. branch support 0.8 aLRT support was collapsed using TreeGraph2 [36]. the resulting alignments were used to infer an ML phylogenetic tree using PhyML 3.0 [34] with amino acid substitution models. all ML trees were midpoint rooted and branches with 0.8 aLRT support were collapsed using TreeGraph2 [36] sample collection and processing Two capybara faecal samples were collected in brasilia and planaltina, Brazil, in 2016. the extracted viral DNA was enriched with the Illustra TempliPhi amplification kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) the paired-end reads were de novo assembled using SPAdes v 3.12.0 [24], and the resulting contigs (>750 nts) were analysed by BLASTx [25] against a local RefSeq viral protein sequence database. sequence contigs were assembled and analysed in Geneious 11.1.5 [26] for the full genomes assembled for viruses belonging to the Microviridae family. the raw reads were aligned using BWA v0.7.12 [27] for coverage depth assessment. a minimum similarity score of 60 was constructed for the Rep_90_Cap dataset. resulting sequence similarity networks were visualised in Cytoscape V3.7.1 [31] using the organic layout. BLASTp [25] analysis of the MCP of the microviruses was undertaken to determine the closest related protein sequences using the complete MCP (MCP_all) dataset. the alignments were used to infer the ML phylogenetic tree for each cluster using PhyML 3.0 [34] with the amino acid substitution model. all ML trees were midpoint rooted and branches with 0.8 aLRT support were collapsed using TreeGraph2 [36]. 201 CRESS DNA viruses were identified using HTS technologies. of these, 164 span four known viral families (Genomoviridae, Circoviridae, Smacoviridae, and Microviridae) the group of CRESS DNA viruses has increased drastically in recent years due to the broad application of metagenomics approaches. the capybara-associated genomoviruses (n = 14) identified in this study were all recovered from one of the capybara faecal samples (Cap1) they have been named capybara genomovirus 1\u201313 (CapGV1\u201313), with CapGV 2 having two variants, cap1_52 and cap1_64, sharing 98% genome-wide identity. a genome-wide pairwise identity of the CapGVs with representative sequences from all known species phylogenetic analysis of the Rep sequences of genomoviruses identified in this study reveals that they can be classified within four established genera, including Gemycircularvirus (n = 3), Gemydunguivirus (n = 4), Gemykibivirus (n = 5), Gemykronzavirus (n = 1) and one likely to an unclassified genus (Figure 2). the CP and Rep amino acid sequences of CapGV3, CapGV13, and CapGV8 share 55.1%\u201365.3% and 85%\u201396% identity amongst themselves. the genomovirus CapGV6 (MK483078) has the nonanucleotide motif \u201cTAATGTTAT\u201d and does not group within any of the current nine established genera. 1 shares 53.3% identity with the CP of the Pacific flying fox faeces associated gemycircularvirus 5. its Rep shares 78.4% sequence identity to that of CapGV11 (MK483083) from this study. the genomoviruses that group within the Gemykibivirus genus are the CapGV12 (MK483084), CapGV4 (MK483076), CapGV2 (MK483073\u2013MK483074 the family is divided into two genera: Circovirus and Cyclovirus.
