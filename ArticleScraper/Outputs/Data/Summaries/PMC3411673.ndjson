{"summary": "tonsils and adenoids harbor bacterial and viral pathogens, but their role as causative agents of adenotonsillar hyperplasia is largely unknown. systematic studies of viruses in adenoids and tonsils have been scarce, especially in association with chronic hypertrophic tonsillar disease. the high rates of detection of respiratory viruses in adenoids and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic adenotonsillar disease bring new insights about the transmission of respiratory viruses. 121 children (63 boys) 1 to 14 years of age (mean age 5.93.2 years years) were enrolled in the study. RT/TH group: Included 50 patients (41.3%) with 1 to 14 years of age (mean 6.33 years) with recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hyperplasia. non RT/TH group: Included 11 patients (9.1%) with 3 to 10 years of age (mean of 7.09 years), with normal size tonsils. all samples were transported on ice within less than four hours to the virology laboratory. the tissue fragments were washed twice with MEM to remove excess of cells debris and blood. they were cut into portions of approximately 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm using RNAse free surgical material. samples were tested by TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) for the presence of genomes of human bocavirus (HBoV), human adenovirus (HAdV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (HEV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) A and B, metapneumovirus (H1N1 2009), parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1 and 3, and coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and duplex qPCR assays were done in a final volume of 15 L with 3 l of cDNA, 10 M forward and reverse primers, 5 M probe and 7.5 l of TaqMan master mix. qPCR was done with 300 ng of extracted DNA in a final volume of 10 L, containing 10 M forward and reverse primers, 5 M probe and 5 L of TaqMan master mix. Statistical Analysis Chi-square and Exact Chi-square tests were used to compare patient groups and viral detection rates in relation to different parameters analyzed. agreement between samples was tested using Kappa test. analysis of presence of viruses in relation to ages and clinical conditions were done with Mann-Whitney test. d 49 patients (40.5%) with 2 to 13 years of age (mean age 5.85 years) with only tonsillar hyperplasia (RT/TH) non RT/TH group: Included 11 patients (9.1%) with 3 to 10 years of age (mean of 7.09 years), with normal size tonsils and no history of recurrent tonsillitis. all samples were transported on ice within less than four hours to the virology laboratory. the tissue fragments were washed twice with MEM to remove excess of cells debris and blood. they were macerated in Trizol and in one preservative solution for further nucleic acids extraction. Detection of Respiratory Viruses Nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L of nasopharyngeal secretions using the QIAamp Min Elute Virus Spin Kit. samples were tested by TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) for the presence of genomes of human bocavirus (HBoV), human adenovirus (HAdV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (HEV), human respiratory syncytial virus qPCR was done using 1 g of extracted RNA primed with random hexamers. duplex qPCR assays were done in a final volume of 15 L with 3 l of cDNA, 10 M forward and reverse primers, 5 M probe and 7.5 l of TaqMan master mix. negative controls were RT-qPCR products from RNA or DNA extracted from cultures of uninfected Hela cells; RT-qPCR product from ultrapure water; and just qPCR product from ultrapure water. analysis of presence of viruses in relation to ages and clinical conditions was done with Mann-Whitney test.

HBoV is a recently identified parvovirus, found in association with respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders [18], [19]. the presently reported study found HBoV in nearly 24% of the adenoids. this suggests a preference for adenoids over palatine tonsils. this is the first report of viral co-infection in chronic adenotonsillar diseases. in situ hybridization in younger patients with higher degrees of palatine tonsil hypertrophy than in older patients with lower degrees of hypertrophy. it is tempting to speculate that virus products may function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), that would maintain inflammation by the stimulation of the innate immunity. this would lead to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of tonsils whose enlarged sizes would cause clinical features of chronic tonsillar disease. specific viruses appear to preferentially infect tissues, such as human enteroviruses. these tissues may serve as inter-seasonal virus reservoirs, with possible impact in transmission in the community."}
