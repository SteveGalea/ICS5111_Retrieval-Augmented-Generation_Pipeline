{"summary": "FCoVs belong to subgroup 1a of Coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae. other members of this subgroup include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, raccoon/dog coronavirus and Chinese ferret badger coronavirus. it is not yet clear which alterations in the FCoV genome are responsible for the generation of FIPV from FECV. the disease was reported as a major factor of kitten mortality in UK [9] and is currently one of the leading infectious diseases causing death among young cats from shelters and catteries. RNA was extracted from infected cells using TRIZOL\u00ae Reagent. the partial 3'UTR was amplified by RT-PCR using previously described primers. PCR products of 10 positive cases were selected randomly. the primers of this PCR assay were chosen from a highly conserved region of 3'UTR of the FCoV genome to detect most, if not all of the FCoV strains. the usefulness of these primers for a general screening test has been reported previously [14-16]. distribution of feline coronavirus positive cats categorized by age, breed and gender. criteria No. of tested cats No. of FCoV-positive cats FCoV-positivity (%) Odds Odds Ratio Confidence Interval Age 2 years 17 16 94 16 3.5556 0.2816 to 44.886 2 years 11 9 82 4.5 Breed. list of feline coronavirus isolates and strains included in the sequence and phylogenetic analysis. no.
