{"summary": "eosinophilia was present and was abnormally elevated on the 1st day after admission. a chest CT scan revealed diffuse micronodular opacities. a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a granulocytic pleocytosis. not found any blood-specific antibodies against C pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia psitacci, Legionella pneumophila, and human immunodeficiency virus. pathology examination of a left temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable. an oral corticosteroid therapy was therefore started and yielded a minor improvement of the clinical picture. granulocytic pleocytosis was attributed to eosinophilia. toxocariasis immunodiagnosis via ELISA for intrathecal-specific antibody synthesis was positive. brain lesions observed by MRI consistent with a hypothesis of cerebral vasculitis caused by toxocariasis. etics of Clinical, Radiologic, and Laboratory Parameters 1 Week Before Admission Hospitalization Day 1 Hospitalization Day 9 Hospitalization Day 13 1 month after admission At the time of diagnosis 3 weeks after 20-day treatment with albendazole 1 year later Eosinophilia. toxocariasis after ingestion of local raw snails used as a folk remedy for gastric ulcer has been reported only twice, once in catalonia [15] and once in Italy [16] Terrestrial mollusks are not recognized as paratenic hosts for Toxocara spp larvae. it would be illogical to draw general pathophysiological conclusions from 3 cases. ules is toxic to endothelial cells and muscle cells, particularly in the heart. this 3-week, high-dosage treatment with corticosteroids avoided further major sequelae in our patient."}
