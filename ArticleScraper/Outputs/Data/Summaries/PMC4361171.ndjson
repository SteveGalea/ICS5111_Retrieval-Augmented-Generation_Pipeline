{"summary": "in the united states, a new viral subtype of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, a combination of swine, avian and human virus, was identified in the united states. in the united states, between April and may 2009, 60% of cases occurred in children and adolescents, and only 5% in those aged 51 years and over[9]. in the united states, between April and may 2009, 60% of cases occurred in children and adolescents, and only 5% in those aged 51 years and over cases were concentrated between five and 59 years, whereas seasonal influenza from 2005 to 2008 totaled 17% and 32% respectively. the presence of co-morbidity was frequent among hospitalized cases, from 27% in the united states to 79% in Brazil [11]. chronic pulmonary diseases were the main pre-existing diseases. case-control study was performed with patients who had been hospitalized for more than 24 hours, with a confirmed infection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and SARI. the study period included the majority of confirmed cases and deaths from this epidemic in 2009, according to the epidemiological week of onset of symptoms, metropolitan regions of So Paulo and Campinas, Brazil. 56.5% belonged to the Unified Health System-SUS and 43.5% were private hospitals. the data were collected: previous pathological history, occurrence of pregnancy, health care, symptomatology during admission, laboratory and radiological tests, need for ICU admission, treatment, complications and disease progression. the use of data was approved by the National Health Council for Human Research. data collection was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the national health council for human research. model was controlled for epidemiologic week of admission at hospital. a second model was developed with patients aged 18 to 22 years with incomplete higher education. patients with no occupation were included in reference category of occupational risk.
