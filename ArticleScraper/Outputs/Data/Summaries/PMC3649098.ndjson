{"summary": "zinc supplementation resulted in 12.7\u201315.2 cm of growth in 1 y. zinc supplementation resulted in 12.7\u201315.2 cm of growth in 1 y. zinc supplementation resulted in 12.7\u201315.2 cm of growth in 1 y. in 1974, the FDA declared it mandatory to include zinc in the total parenteral nutrition fluids (8). the nutritional deficiency of zinc, which is present throughout the developing world, and a conditioned deficiency of zinc, which may complicate many diseased states, are discussed. vikbladh (14) analyzed serum zinc by the dithizone technique. the normal level was 19.7 0.24 mol/L, a value similar to what has been reported by modern techniques. in 1956, Vallee et al. (12) reported that serum zinc was decreased in many chronic diseases, including liver disease. a second group was given the same diet plus a capsule of zinc sulfate. a third group received the diet without additional supplement for 6 mo. the two women lived in the house of Dr. Ronaghy. dermatologic manifestations of severe zinc deficiency in patients with AE include bullous pustular dermatitis of the extremities. neuropsychiatric signs include irritability, emotional instability, tremors, and occasional cerebellar ataxia. weight loss, growth retardation, and male hypogonadism are prominent clinical features. in 1975, the occurrence of severe zinc deficiency in subjects receiving total parenteral nutrition for prolonged periods without zinc. in the united states, zinc is now being routinely included in total parenteral fluids for subjects who are likely to receive such therapy for extended period. male hypogonadism in adolescents, rough skin, poor appetite, delayed wound healing, cell-mediated immune dysfunctions, and abnormal neurosensory changes have been reported. a nutritional deficiency of zinc in humans is fairly prevalent throughout the world, particularly in areas where cereal proteins are primary in local diets. deoxythymidine kinase (TK), an enzyme required for conversion of deoxythymidine to deoxythymidine 5\u2032-monophosphate, is significantly decreased in the implanted sponge connective tissue. this reduced activity of TK decreased DNA, protein, and collagen synthesis in rats (34). this reduced activity of TK decreased DNA, protein, and collagen synthesis in rats. a mild deficiency of zinc in humans affects clinical, biochemical, and immunological functions adversely. a decrease in intracellular free zinc is critical for LPS-mediated CD4+ T-cell activation by dendritic cells. zinc inhibits the membrane phosphodiesterase, leading to elevated levels of the second messenger guanosine 3\u2032,5\u2032 cyclic monophosphate. zinc induces A-20, which inhibits NF-B signaling via TNF receptor\u2013associated factor pathways. zinc deficiency affects T helper subset 1 cell function adversely in humans. state 13 acetate (PMA)/phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA)\u2013stimulated cells were increased compared with zinc-deficient cells (47). intracellular free zinc increased only slightly in PMA/PHA-stimulated cells. in concanavalin A\u2013stimulated cells in zinc-sufficient medium, there was an increased sustained level of intracellular free zinc. dietary zinc restriction may lead to hyperammonemia (49) Rabbani and Prasad (49) observed a decrease in hepatic ornithine transcarbamoylase activity. increased activity of the purine nucleotide enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase as a result of zinc deficiency has also been observed. zinc deficiency in SCD patients was decreased levels of zinc in the plasma, erythrocytes, and hair; hyperzincuria; decreased activity of certain zinc-dependent enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes. increased activity of this enzyme in plasma was considered to be evidence of zinc deficiency. supplemented subjects showed significant decreases in LPS-induced TNF- and IL-1 mRNA and TNF-induced NF-B DNA binding in mononuclear cells (MNCs) compared with the placebo group (55). zinc supplementation also increased relative levels of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor mRNA in PHA-stimulated MNCs (55). zinc is an adjunct to antibiotics in infants with probable serious bacterial infections. zinc is a major cause of death in early infancy in developing countries. zinc is an adjunct to antibiotics in infants with probable serious bacterial infections. participants took 1 lozenge containing 12.8 mg zinc (as acetate) or placebo every 2\u20133 h while awake. subjects for sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle ache, fever, and headache were recorded daily for 12 d. blinding of subjects was adequate, and adverse effects were comparable in the 2 groups. the mean changes between zinc and placebo groups showed significant differences in soluble IL-1-ra and soluble ICAM-1 level (P = 0.033) trials using zinc for at least 5 consecutive days to treat or at least 5 mo to prevent the common cold were included for analysis. studies reporting the duration and severity of cold symptoms suggest that zinc significantly reduced the overall duration and severity of common cold symptoms if the therapy was started within 24 h of the onset of the cold. the gene for Wilson\u2019s disease has been identified. the mutation leads to a defective production of a protein called ATP7B. ATP7B is responsible for key step in biliary excretion of copper. the disease is recessive; thus, both copies of the ATP7B gene have to be mutated. ninety percent of patients have low levels of ceruloplasmin. urinary copper, however, may be elevated in patients with obstructive liver disease also who do not have Wilson\u2019s disease. initial treatment objective is to decrease copper levels or otherwise affect copper such that new copper toxicity is avoided. c blocks food copper but also the copper excreted via salivary, gastric, and other gastrointestinal juices. the only side effect is that 10% of the subjects may have gastric discomfort. zinc has no toxicity and is nonteratogenic; therefore, it can be given to all ages and even the pregnant women. deficiency induced by zinc; 3) antioxidants plus zinc; or 4) placebo. in the group taking zinc alone, the risk of advanced AMD developing was reduced by 21% and vision loss by 11%. only the zinc-supplemented group showed increased longevity (74) zinc supplementation decreased oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxyalkenals (HAEs) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine in the plasma. zinc upregulates the expression of A20 and the binding of A20 transactivating factor to DNA, which results in the inhibition of NF-B activation in isolated MNCs. zinc supplementation consisted of 45 mg elemental zinc (as gluconate) daily for 12 mo. the plasma zinc was lower and the percentage of cells producing IL-1 and TNF- and the generated cytokines were significantly higher in the elderly. oxidative stress markers and the generation of inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly. zinc supplementation may also prove to be an excellent agent for the prevention of chronic diseases. a 2-y-old girl with severe acrodermatitis enteropathica was treated with diiodohydroxyquinolone and a lactose-deficient synthetic diet. the serum zinc concentration was significantly decreased. they administered oral zinc sulfate to correct this deficiency. the skin lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms cleared after zinc supplementation. l opacities include irritability, emotional instability, tremors, and occasional cerebellar ataxia. weight loss, growth retardation, and male hypogonadism are prominent clinical features. AE patients have increased susceptibility to infections. the excessive loss of zinc results in severe deficiency of zinc. if zinc deficiency is not recognized and treated, the condition may become fatal (8). acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a lethal, autosomal, recessive trait that usually occurs in infants of Italian, Armenian, or Iranian lineage (21) the disease develops in the early months of life soon after weaning from breastfeeding. AE patients have an increased susceptibility to infections. the AE gene has been localized to a 3.5-cm region on the 8q24 chromosome. the gene encodes a histidine-rich protein, now referred to as ZIP-4. in patients with AE, mutations in this gene have been documented. severe deficiency of zinc has also been observed in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease who received penicillamine therapy as decoppering agent. this treatment may induce excessive zinc loss and cause severe deficiency of zinc (27). zinc deficiency decreases circulating IGF-1 concentration (30, 31) in humans, zinc deficiency decreases circulating IGF-1 concentration (30, 31) phosphorylation occurs within the cell leading to regulation of cell cycle and cell division. zinc is required for IGF-1 generation, phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor, and upregulation of the activity of TK, all of which are involved in cell division and growth. in rats, the activity of deoxythymidine kinase (TK) is significantly decreased in the implanted sponge connective tissue. this diet averaged 12 mg/d of zinc, consistent with the RDA. volunteers received 2.0\u20135.0 mg/d of zinc while consuming a soy protein-based experimental diet. this regimen was continued for 28 wk. zinc deficiency affects T helper subset 1 cell function adversely in humans. plasma zinc decreased after 20 to 24 wk of institution of a zinc-restricted diet. zinc is involved in monocyte/macrophage development. human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line of the Th0 phenotype cells showed that in zinc-sufficient cells, mRNA levels of IFN-, IL-12 receptor 2 and T-bet (a transcription factor involved in T-cell differentiation) in phorbol-12 myristate 13 acetate (PMA)/phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA)\u2013stimulated cells were increased compared with zinc-deficient cells (47). TRIF-mediated signaling increases the ZnT (a solute carrier )-5 mRNA and decreases ZIP-6 mRNA, thus resulting in a decrease in intracellular free zinc in DCs. zinc deficiency affects T helper subset 1 cell function adversely in humans (36\u201338, 43) wk of the institution of the experimental diet suggests that T helper subset 1 cells are very sensitive to zinc restriction. in the human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line of the Th0 phenotype, we showed that in zinc-sufficient cells, mRNA levels of IFN-, IL-12 receptor 2 and T-bet were increased compared with zinc-deficient cells (47). low serum and hepatic zinc and hyperzincuria were reported in patients with cirrhosis of the liver many years ago. some patients with cirrhosis of the liver who had night blindness did not respond to vitamin A supplementation. however, they responded to zinc administration (21). zinc deficiency was a reversible cause of sexual dysfunction in uremia. growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, hyperammonemia, abnormal dark adaptation, and cell-mediated immune dysfunction have been related to a deficiency of zinc. zinc-supplemented subjects had decreased incidence of infections, increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. plasma nitrite and nitrate, lipid peroxidation products, DNA oxidation products decreased in the zinc-supplemented group compared with the placebo group (55). zinc-deficient rats have a defect in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. zinc deficiency also affects urea synthesis and thus an abnormality related to metabolism of amino acids. zinc deficiency in adult sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, hyperammonemia, abnormal dark adaptation, and cell-mediated immune dysfunction have been related to a deficiency of zinc. zinc supplementation in SCD patients resulted in significant improvement in secondary sexual characteristics. zinc-supplemented subjects showed significant decreases in LPS-induced TNF- and IL-1 mRNA and TNF-induced NF-B DNA binding in mononuclear cells (MNCs) compared with the placebo group (55). zinc supplementation also increased relative levels of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor mRNA in PHA-stimulated MNCs (55). zinc supplementation with 2\u20134 times the daily RDA for 2 wk after an episode of acute or persistent diarrhea was reported. the pooled analysis showed an 11% decrease in diarrhea incidence and a 34% decrease in diarrhea prevalence during 3-mo observation period. serious bacterial infections are a major cause of death in early infancy in developing countries. participants took 1 lozenge containing 13.3 mg of zinc (as acetate) or placebo every 2\u20133 h while awake. subjects for sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle ache, fever, and headache were recorded daily for 12 d. the zinc group had a shorter mean overall duration of the cold (4.0 vs 7.1 d, P = 0.001), cough (2.1 vs 5.0 d, P 0.001), and nasal discharge (3.0 vs 4.5 d, P = 0.02). Symptom severity scores were significantly decreased in the zinc group (P = 0.002) a decrease in plasma ICAM-1 levels due to zinc therapy may have decreased the docking of cold viruses on the surface of somatic cells. a meta-analysis selected randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least 5 consecutive days to treat or at least 5 mo. supplementation with zinc has been shown to prevent and treat diarrhea in children younger than 5 y of age, decreasing both diarrhea morbidity and mortality (56, 57). zinc deficiency is also correlated with the risk of respiratory tract infections, but the benefit of supplementation appears to be limited to more severe episodes. zinc supplementation with 2\u20134 times the daily RDA for 2 wk after an episode of acute or persistent diarrhea was reported. the pooled analysis showed an 11% decrease in diarrhea incidence and a 34% decrease in diarrhea prevalence during 3-mo observation period (57). participants took 1 lozenge containing 12.8 mg zinc (as acetate) or placebo every 2\u20133 h while awake. subjects for sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle ache, fever, and headache were recorded daily for 12 d. the zinc group had a shorter mean overall duration of the cold (4.0 vs 7.1 d, P = 0.001), cough (2.1 vs 5.0 d, P 0.001) and nasal discharge (3.0 vs 4.5 d, P = 0.02) the mean changes between zinc and placebo groups showed significant differences in soluble IL-1-ra (P = 0.033) and soluble ICAM-1 level (P = 0.04) a decrease in plasma ICAM-1 levels due to zinc therapy may have decreased the docking of cold viruses on the surface of somatic cells. a meta-analysis selected randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least 5 consecutive days to treat or at least 5 mo to prevent the common cold. gluconate are good salts to use; citric acid, glycine, tartarate, and other binders are good salts. zinc lozenges must be used orally and allowed to dissolve slowly in the mouth. supplementation with zinc has been shown to prevent and treat diarrhea in children younger than 5 y of age. zinc supplementation with 2\u20134 times the daily RDA for 2 wk after an episode of acute or persistent diarrhea was reported. the pooled analysis showed an 11% decrease in diarrhea incidence and a 34% decrease in diarrhea prevalence during 3-mo observation period (57). participants took 1 lozenge containing 12.8 mg zinc (as acetate) or placebo every 2\u20133 h while awake. subjects for sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle ache, fever, and headache were recorded daily for 12 d. group had a shorter mean overall duration of the cold (4.0 vs 7.1 d, P = 0.001), cough (2.1 vs 5.0 d, P 0.001), and nasal discharge (3.0 vs 4.5 d, P = 0.02) the mean changes between zinc and placebo groups showed significant differences in soluble IL-1-ra and soluble ICAM-1 level (P = 0.04) zinc therapy may have decreased the docking of cold viruses on the surface of somatic cells. a meta-analysis selected randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least 5 days to treat or at least 5 mo to prevent the common cold. the gene for Wilson\u2019s disease has been identified. the mutation leads to a defective production of a protein called ATP7B. this protein is responsible for key step in biliary excretion of copper. the disease is recessive; thus, both copies of the ATP7B gene have to be mutated. 90 percent of patients have low levels of ceruloplasmin, and ceruloplasmin-bound copper and nonceruloplasmin-bound copper are elevated in the plasma. urinary copper, however, may be elevated in patients with obstructive liver disease also who do not have Wilson\u2019s disease. initial treatment objective is to decrease copper levels or otherwise affect copper such that new copper toxicity is avoided. zinc has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Wilson's disease patients. a total of 3640 participants were enrolled. the average follow-up period was 6.3 y. zinc 80 mg as zinc oxide and copper 2 mg as copper oxide to prevent copper deficiency induced by zinc; 3) antioxidants plus zinc; or 4) placebo. in the group taking zinc alone, the risk of advanced AMD developing was reduced by 25% and vision loss by 11%. inflammatory cytokines have been recognized as important contributing factors for several chronic diseases attributed to aging. chronic inflammatory processes have been implicated in high cardiovascular mortality in elderly subjects. zinc supplementation decreased oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxyalkenals (HAEs) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine in the plasma. zinc upregulates expression of A20 and binding of A20 transactivating factor to DNA. zinc supplementation consisted of 45 mg elemental zinc (as gluconate) daily for 12 mo. the plasma zinc was lower and the percentage of cells producing IL-1 and TNF- and the generated cytokines were significantly higher in the elderly. zinc supplementation (45 mg/d elemental zinc) in elderly subjects decreased incidence of infection by nearly 66%. oxidative stress markers and the generation of inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly before supplementation. zinc deficiency may affect nearly 30%\u201340% of the well-off healthy ambulatory elderly subjects in the Detroit area. the zinc-supplemented group received 45 mg/d zinc as gluconate for 6 mo. the zinc-supplemented group received 45 mg/d zinc as gluconate for 6 mo. zinc increased A20 and PPAR- proteins in oxLDL-stimulated THP-1 cells. no significant difference in NF-B activation by either NF-B\u2013driven luciferase reporter gene assay or electrophoretic mobility shift assay. zinc-sufficient THP-1 cells showed a significant decrease in NF-B activation compared with zinc-deficient cells. zinc-deficient (Zn) THP-1 cells and zinc-sufficient (Zn+) THP-1 cells were used for the measurement of NF-B activation. a high plasma CRP concentration is a risk factor that is independent of other risk factors such as total cholesterol, LDL, age, smoking, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension (46). zinc supplementation (45 mg elemental zinc as gluconate) daily was effective in lowering plasma CRP concentration in the elderly. increased production of ROS and activation of redox-dependent signaling cascades are involved in atherosclerosis (46, 78) zinc supplementation decreased oxidative stress in elderly subjects and human vascular endothelial and monocytic cells. zinc inhibited NF-B activation by inducing A20, a transactivating factor that played a role in reducing IL-1\u2013 and TNF-\u2013induced NF-B activation. inflammation generates ROS, resulting in oxLDL. zinc may have an atheroprotective function by the following mechanisms: inhibition of ROS generation via metallothionein (MT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and inhibition of NADPH oxidase. zinc may have an atheroprotective function by the following mechanisms: downregulation of atherosclerotic cytokines/molecules. type 1 diabetes mellitus accounts for 5%\u201310% of all cases of diabetes. it is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic cells, resulting in virtually no production of insulin. exogenous insulin administration is the main treatment for this situation. zinc is a potent physiological regulator of insulin signal transduction. zinc deficiency contributes to diabetes-induced renal oxidative damage. a positive correlation between hyperzincuria and hyperzincuria has been observed. il-1, IL-6, TNF-, and CRP were elevated several years before type 2 diabetes (80, 84) in nested case-control and prospective trials, it was shown that IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and CRP were elevated several years before the onset of type 2 diabetes. AD now represents the most prevalent form of dementia in modern society. the most pronounced features are the presence of extracellular deposits known as plaques. ietal gyri, medial temporal gyrus, thalamus, and hippocampus in AD patients. senile plaque cores consist of -amyloid protein (AB) derived from a larger transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) dysregulation in various metal storage and transport proteins may contribute to a failure in zinc homeostasis (87). AB/Zn ratios 1:0.1 and 1:0.01 result in a protective activity against AB toxicity. this effect is mediated in part by a modulation of Na+K+ATPase activity that prevents typical calcium dyshomeostasis and cell death associated with AB toxicity. studies using Tg576 mice have suggested that zinc may hold amyloid load in a dissociable equilibrium. clioquinol and PBT2 treatment showed a redistribution of metals in the brain and do not chelate metals out of the system (87). a placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation was conducted for 6 mo recently in AD patients in Florida (95) IL-1 was shown to upregulate the production of APP in cord blood and brain. excess inflammatory cytokine IL-1 was a driving force in neurodegeneration. IL-1 may also contribute to memory deficits in AD by decreasing levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholine. zinc supplementation may be a very important therapeutic adjunct of AD. zinc deficiency increases the generation of inflammatory cytokines, increases oxidative stress, and induces endothelial cell dysfunction. zinc supplementation may affect nearly 30%\u201340% of the well-off healthy ambulatory elderly subjects in the Detroit area (75, 76) plasma zinc increased in the zinc-supplemented group. no change was observed in the placebo group. plasma zinc increased in the zinc-supplemented group. zinc-sufficient THP-1 cells and HAECs showed a significant decrease in NF-B activation compared with zinc-deficient cells. the cells were incubated either in zinc-deficient (Zn, 1 mol/L) or zinc-sufficient (Zn+, 15 mol/L) medium for 8 d (for the THP-1) and for 6 d (for HAECs) a high plasma CRP concentration is a risk factor that is independent of other risk factors such as total cholesterol, LDL, age, smoking, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension (46). zinc supplementation (45 mg elemental zinc as gluconate) daily was effective in lowering plasma CRP concentration. decreased oxidative stress by zinc may decrease the LDL oxidation. zinc is required for NF-B DNA binding in purified or recombinant NF-B p50 protein of the T helper cell line. zinc decreased oxLDL-induced generation of TNF-, IL-1, and VCAM-1. oxLDL activates the NF-B inducible kinase/NF-B signaling pathway. it upregulates downstream target genes such as inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, fibrinogen, and tissue factor. zinc supplementation increased plasma concentration of antioxidant power. cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), fibrinogen, and tissue factor (TF) through inhibition of NF-B activation by A20-mediating TNF\u2013receptor associated factor (TRAF) signaling. arrows with a broken line indicate downregulation or the inhibitory pathway. a controlled trial of zinc supplementation should be conducted in elderly subjects. diabetes mellitus accounts for >90% of the cases of diabetes. there is no problem in insulin production initially by the cells. Eventually, however, islet cell function also declines, leading to overt diabetes. zinc deficiency contributes to diabetes-induced renal oxidative damage. zinc supplementation (5 mg/kg zinc sulfate) attenuated diabetes-induced inflammation and prevented the kidney from diabetes-induced proteinuria and pathological alterations. a prospective study of zinc intake and risk of type 2 diabetes was assessed among 82,297 women 33\u201360 y of age at baseline in 1980. the highest quintiles of both total and dietary zinc intake were significantly associated with an 20% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. zinc concentrations in the brain tend to increase from birth to adulthood. the serum/plasma zinc in AD patients has been reported to be increased, unchanged, and decreased (87, 89, 90) there is no difference in zinc level in frontal lobe tissue of brain between AD and controls. APP possesses iron-export ferroxidase activity that is inhibited by zinc. a disturbance in zinc homeostasis may result in decreased ferroxidase activity. a disturbance in zinc homeostasis may result in decreased ferroxidase activity, resulting in iron accumulation. zinc-AB aggregates may form so as to inhibit the reduction of Cu2+. this represents the role of zinc as an antioxidant, which results by displacing pro-oxidant Cu2+. studies using Tg576 mice have suggested zinc may hold amyloid load in a dissociable equilibrium. a placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation was conducted for 6 mo recently in AD patients in Florida (95) the subjects received 150 mg/d of elemental zinc away from food. the product releases zinc slowly in the stomach and later in the small intestine. IL-1 may also contribute to memory deficits in AD by decreasing levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholine. zinc deficiency in humans and in cell culture models activates macrophages and monocytes by increasing oxidative stress. increased IL-1 in turn could upregulate the generation of AB and tau proteins and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. a number of metal-modulatory compounds have been developed that normalize cerebral zinc ion homeostasis (87) clioquinol treatment in aged Tg 2576 mice showed a significant reduction in plaque burden parallel with a shift in brain content of AB toward more soluble species (87) clioquinol and PBT2 showed profound effects in transgenic mouse models of AD (87) a placebo group continued to deteriorate in patients age 70 y and older. the study showed a statistically significant effect of zinc supplementation on cognitive function. neuronal stress and consequent overexpression of proinflammatory proteins are the likely instigators of neuropathological changes. zinc supplementation may be a very important therapeutic adjunct of AD. if correct, zinc supplementation may prove to be a very important therapeutic adjunct of AD."}
