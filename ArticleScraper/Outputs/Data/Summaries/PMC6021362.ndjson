{"summary": "assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. 80% of ARIs worldwide.1,2) Clinical manifestations of ARI can hardly differentiate bacterial from viral etiologies. a more accurate diagnosis of causative ARI pathogens does not decrease hospital admissions or antibiotic use in children. respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A, RSV B), parainfluenza virus 1-4 (PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, PIV 4), human coronavirus 229E and OC43 (hCV-229E, hCV-OC43), human rhinovirus (hRV), human enterovirus (hEV), adenovirus (AdV), human bocavirus (hBV), and human metapneumovirus (hMP study population This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Korea University Guro Hospital (KUGH) hospitalized patients under 15 years of age with a discharge diagnosis of ARI from January 2013 to December 2015 were enrolled. ARI was diagnosed based on one of symptoms or signs. the presence of each virus was determined using the Seeplex RV15 RT-PCR assay (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, Korea). two sets of primers were designed based on conserved regions of genetic sequences for the 15 respiratory viruses mentioned above. the most commonly identified viruses were hRV (326 of 1,747, 18.7%), RSV A (297 of 1,747, 17.0%), RSV B (211 of 1,747, 12.1%), AdV (210 of 1,747, 12.1%), hMPV (130 of 1,747, 7.4%), IFA (114 of 1,747, 6.5%), and hEV (113 of 1,747, 6.5%). 487 (59.1) 1\u20133 yr 1,390 (40.0) 660 (47.4) 382 (27.5) 1,042 (74.9) Male sex 779 (56.0) 362 (54.8) 229 (59.9) 591 (56.7) 3\u20137 yr 770 (22.0) 334 (43.4) 108 (14.0) 442 (57.4) Male sex 411 (53.4) 180 (53.9) 69 (63.9) 252 (57.0) 7\u201315 17 (29.8) 38 (29.2) 1\u20133 yr 29 (25.4) 9 (16.4) 101 (34.0) 81 (38.4) 70 (39.8) 22 (37.7) 45 (39.8) 82 (39.0) 39 (68.4) 59 (45.4) 3\u20137 yr 35 (30.7) 22 (40.0) 12 (4.0) 15 (7.1) 24 (13.6) 11 (19.0) 69 (21.2) 36 (31.9) 83 (39.5) 1 ( 13 (6.2) 7 (12.3) 13 (10.0) Fever >7 days 9 (7.9) 4 (7.3) 15 (5.1) 8 (3.8) 25 (14.2) 3 (5.2) 35 (10.7) 12 (10.6) 32 (15.2) 3 (5.3) 13 (10.0) Wheezing 6 (5.3) 3 (5.5) 104 (35.0)* 90 (42.7)* 29 (16.5) 7 (12.1) 94 (28.8) 1 (0.9) 12 (5.7) 15 (26.3) 29 (22.3 32 (28.1)* 10 (18.2) 8 (2.7) 6 (2.8) 2 (1.1) 4 (6.9) 45 (13.8) 29 (25.7)* 39 (18.6)* 2 (3.5) 6 (4.6) NLR3 48 (42.1)* 20 (36.4) 22 (7.4) 12 (5.7) 16 (9.1) 14 (24.1) 81 (24.8) 51 (45.1)* 78 (37.1)* 11 (19.3) 13 (10.0) NLR1 29 (25.4) 15 (27.3) 195 (6 mg (L) 57 (50.0) 39 (70.9) 209 (70.4)* 135 (66.5) 36 (62.1) 184 (56.4) 47 (41.6) 40 (19.0) 34 (59.6) 77 (59.2) CRP20 mg (L) 32 (28.1) 12 (21.8) 55 (18.5) 41 (19.4) 35 (19.9) 16 (27.6) 101 (31.0) 34 (30.1) 141 (67.1)* 10 (17.5) 27 (20.8) ESR20 mm ( 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Treatment and outcomes Antibiotics use 55 (48.2) 19 (34.5) 200 (67.3) 155 (73.5) 129 (73.3) 37 (63.8) 216 (66.3) 76 (67.3) 159 (75.7) 42 (73.7) 108 (83.1)* Steroid use 1 (0.9) 0 (0) 11 (3.7) 11 (5.2) 9 (5.1) 0 (0) 28 (8.6)* 1 (0.9) 1 (0.5 cases with multiple viruses were detected more frequently in younger cases (1 year old vs. >7 years old was 80.3% vs. 36.3%, P=0.000) cases with multiple viruses tended to be male-dominant when compared to single-virus cases (62.6% vs. 55.1%, P=0.001) IFA and IFB were most common from winter to spring, while hMPV was predominant in the spring, and PIV and hEV common from spring to summer. HRV and AdV did not show a discrete seasonal pattern. most cases of ARI presented with cough and rhinorrhea. fever was associated with many viruses, but RSV A, RSV B, and hRV were not significantly associated with fever. vomiting was significantly associated with IFA, hEV, and AdV. neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 3 was more associated with IFA, IFB, AdV, hRV, and hEV. monocytosis greater than 1,000/L was observed more with RSV A, RSV B, PIV, and hMPV. thrombocytopenia less than 100,000/L was observed more with hCV-OC43. among the 1,747 single-virus cases, the most common were hRV (727 of 2,424, 30.0%), AdV (493 of 2,424, 20.3%), and RSV A (411 of 2,424, 17.0%) of those examined, 1,747 (49.8%) had a single virus detected on PCR, and 677 (19.3%) had more than one virus detected. human enterovirus; AdV, adenovirus; hBV, human bocavirus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus.

Croup was most commonly associated with PIV and hCV (20.5%, 31.0%), while pneumonia was associated with RSV A, RSV B, and hMPV (63.0%, 52.1%, and 68.5%) bronchiolitis was associated with RSV A and B (24.6% and 29.9%), while asthma exacerbations were associated with hR leukopenia less than 4,000/L was observed more with IFA, IFB. neutrophil-dominant inflammation, represented by a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 3, was more associated with IFA, IFB, AdV, hRV, and hEV. thrombocytopenia less than 100,000/L was observed more with hCV-OC43 (7.9%, P=0.000) both C-reactive protein levels greater than 20 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 40 mm/hr were associated with AdV. when cases of bacterial coinfection were excluded, viruses were detected in 69.1% of cases. hRV, hRV, and PIV were the most prevalent single pathogens in patients younger than 3 years old. we compared single-virus cases to understand characteristics of each virus. hRV and AdV are prevalent throughout the year. seasonal patterns of viruses are discrete. cases of hRV and hRV ARI present more commonly with wheezing. eosinophilia and a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation are associated only with hRV infection in this study. if RSV infection causes asthma, lower ARI with pathogens such as hRV and RSV could precipitate the development of asthma. antibiotics are used more often in cases of hMPV and AdV. they are also used more when infection in young infants manifests as a lower ARI. this study has some limitations."}
