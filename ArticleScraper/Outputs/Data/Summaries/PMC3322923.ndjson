{"summary": "I built a simulation model in a standard computer spreadsheet (Excel 2000, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) I first listed each possible incubation period for every patient for whom incubation period data were available. for every patient, I assigned a random number generator (function RAND in Excel software) to each possible incubation period. the 95th percentile is 12 days, with a median (50th percentile) of approximately 4 days. data used for this simulation were obtained from Canada (6), Hong Kong (7), and the united states, for a sample size 19. the method readily \u201caccepts\u201d data in which patients have multiple possible incubation periods. more data will likely reduce the confidence intervals for the frequencies of each incubation day. the method can also be readily adapted to examine other aspects of SARS epidemiology."}
