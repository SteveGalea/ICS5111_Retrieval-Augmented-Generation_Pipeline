{"summary": "the RNAi pathway has a recognized role in regulating host gene expression related to a myriad of cell functions. some viruses encode miRNAs that regulate host gene expression. RNAi pathway is now recognized as a preeminent means for studying gene function. siRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) siRNA guide strand anneals to its complementary target mRNA (25, 26) and facilitates cleavage by Argonaute 2, a core endonuclease of RISC. shRNAs are expressed in the nucleus and predicted to associate with RISC only after being processed by two separate endonucleases. shRNA screens often make use of pools of viral particles that contain expression constructs targeting hundreds to thousands of genes. cell plating followed by virus transduction at low multiplicities of infection. pooled screens are best suited to output assays that permit selection or outgrowth of cells that exhibit the phenotype of interest. siRNA screen stages can take different times depending on the assay and quantitation method. if the intent of the screen is to study viral uptake, infection may be delayed to avoid lipid-mediated siRNA transfection affecting the ability of the virus to bind the cell. full genome-wide screens can take anywhere from weeks to months. a number of bioinformatic approaches have been described. siRNAS AND shRNAS siRNA libraries have been constructed with a variety of designs. recognition of influenza single-stranded RNA genome by the endosomal PRR leads to a strong antiviral cytokine response (38\u201340) transfection of short dsRNA (such as siRNA) can also perturb cellular immunity. extensive studies have shown that siRNAs can act in a similar fashion to miRNAs. false positives induced by this mechanism are frequently mediated by the seed region of the siRNA (nt 2\u20138), and may result in a 2- to 4-fold down-regulation of unintended targets (49). the observed phenotypes are the result of events unrelated to the knockdown of the intended target gene. the current shRNA platforms are essential for performing host-pathogen studies. miRNAS miRNAs have emerged as essential regulators of eukaryotic gene expression (52\u201355) miRNA inhibitors are designed against mature miRNAs and can act as artificial targets to prevent the endogenous miRNA from interacting with its natural targets. a library of mimics and inhibitors was recently used to identify miRNAs that played a role in diverse herpes virus infections. further analysis implicated the miRNAs in a variety of host signaling networks. a host-pathogen screening process is designed to identify candidate genes for in vivo testing and clinical studies. it is recognized that cell lines derived from a range of sources can be contaminated with pathogens, such as mycoplasma. the virus under investigation may be of serious concern to human and/or animal health. RNAi screens that use high-level pathogens limit the amount of work performed at the highest level of containment. if the infection period is complete, protocols allow for virus-infected plates to be decontaminated for removal. pseudotype viruses mimic the viral entry process of the original virus and are competent for a single cycle of infection. 6 RNAi screens incorporating variable methodologies and endpoints have been performed to detect host contributions to influenza replication. some screens focused on early replication events only (31, 33), while others included both early and late events (30, 32, 67). the 6 screens generated a list of potentially relevant host genes that represented 2% of the screened genes. ingenuity pathway analysis can identify significant networks, top functions and canonical pathways associated with different gene hits uncovered by the screen. the observed pathway fidelity from such analysis suggests a conserved set of core processes that are robust to experimental variability and may be coopted during influenza virus infection and replication in a mammalian cell. human A549 A/WSN/33, SOIV A/NL/602/09 Luciferase activity 19,628 295 (295 WSN, 12 SOIV) 2 unique siRNAs to candidate gene decreased viral infection 35% 33 siRNA screen (Qiagen) viral replication measured by titrating A549 supernatant on MDCK cells 22,843 168 (119 WSN, 121 SOIV, 6 HPAI) a major mechanism that transmits extracellular signals to intracellular signaling is the engagement of RTKs (Fig. 2). EGFRs consisting of four members (EGF, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors; ref. 77). cellular endocytosis of influenza coopts pathways used by EGFRs, resulting in protein ubiquitinylation. influenza virus activates RTKs to form lipid raft-based signaling platforms. HA-mediated activation of protein kinase C (PKC) also aids viral entry and cellular proliferation. phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) is generated by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) which functions as a second messenger through interaction with pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins. cells treated with inhibitors of PI3K or PIP3 show significantly decreased influenza virus titers (94), suggesting that PI3K performs influenza-supportive p38 MAPK and JNK have been shown to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in influenza virus-infected cells. NF-B acts via induction of proapoptotic factors, such as TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or FasL (109), and subsequent activation of caspases (111). RNAi screening has demonstrated enormous potential in improving our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. differences in viral subtypes, host cells, assay types, and reagents may be responsible for some of the differences. there has been no definitive study to address these discrepancies. validation employs completely different sets of siRNAs targeting a different seed site on the same gene (32, 33), the use shRNAs (28), multiple screening assays (67), multiple viral strains (32, 33, 67), bioinformatics (29), and completely different gene-silencing technologies. a standard validation method may bring greater parity between screens. bioactive, commercial, academic and natural extract libraries can be screened for antiviral potential, often without the need for delivery reagents. a number of compound library screens have been conducted on madin-darby canine kidney cells to identify influenza inhibitors. Y2H screens Y2H technology allows screening of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (132) y2H screens y2H technology allows screening of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (132) a comprehensive study has recently been conducted in which intraviral protein-protein interactions were analyzed by Y2H technology for 10 influenza virus proteins. the study elegantly combined Y2H and RNAi technology to identify host proteins and pathways involved in physical recognition of influenza proteins. a major advantage of compound library screens is the large number of candidate compounds, sometimes in the millions. microarrays and NGS Microarrays have been used extensively to study host pathways implicated in virus life cycles and to inform our understanding of viral pathogenesis. of the 329 differentially expressed genes identified within 8 h of influenza infection, the majority were down-regulated and could be classified into 5 main groups. despite the large amount of microarray data, it appears that NGS may supersede this technology due to improvements in transcriptome coverage, sensitivity, and resolution. Y2H screens Y2H technology allows screening of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (132). y2H screens y2H technology allows screening of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (132) influenza virus carries all necessary proteins to infect a cell and deliver its vRNP into the cell nucleus. the virus must use host proteins and pathways to import NP and RNA polymerases back into the nucleus to form new vRNP. this is consistent with the subtle differences observed in high-content analysis and in virus replication. it will be vital to the success of this emerging field that such collaborative initiatives promote the development of data standards and best practices that facilitate the comparison of data from complementary screens. this should lead to a better understanding of the factors that most strongly influence screen reproducibility and data quality."}
