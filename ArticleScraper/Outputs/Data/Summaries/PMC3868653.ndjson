{"summary": "spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS+) notification rate. prevalence of TB had decreased globally from 250 cases per 100,000 population in 1990 to 170 cases per 100,000 in 2011. TB continues to be a major public health problem in china with an estimated 1 million incident cases reported. prevalence of TB had decreased from 215 per 100,000 in 1990 to 108 per 100,000 in 2010. a study conducted by Roza DL had used spatial analysis to identify the areas with elevated risk of TB and evaluate the influences of social vulnerability. factors affecting the distribution and pattern of TB, including TB notification rate and TB incidence rate etc., usually show spatial autocorrelation and obvious spatial heterogeneity[11], which is difficult for the traditional model to deal with. the basic unit of reporting TB in the web based surveillance system is the county/district-level in rural and urban area. all counties/districts in mainland china were included in this study. the number of counties changed from 2862 in 2005 to 2856 in 2010 with the merging of some counties as part of administrative reorganization. global spatial autocorrelation analysis based on cross-products for measuring attribute association. value of Global Moran\u2019s I varies between -1 and 1. a higher positive Moran\u2019s I indicates that values in neighboring positions tend to cluster, while a lower negative Moran\u2019s I implies that higher and lower values are interspersed. TB cases notified in each county were used and recorded against the population in the same county which was assumed as the population in the Possion probability model. the space-time scan statistic creates an infinite number of discrete, cylindrical windows with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. number of counties changed from 2862 in 2005 to 2856 in 2010. number of counties and population in china changed from 2005 to 2010. data source County/district level TB notification data from 2005-2011 was extracted from national surveillance system. a higher positive Moran\u2019s I indicates that values in neighboring positions tend to cluster, while a lower negative Moran\u2019s I implies that higher and lower values are interspersed. when Moran\u2019s I is near 0, there is no spatial clustering, meaning that the data are randomly distributed[21]. the space-time scan statistic creates an infinite number of discrete, cylindrical windows with a circular geographic base. the base is defined exactly as for the purely spatial scan statistic, while the height reflects the time period of potential clusters. TB Clusters including most likely cluster and secondary clusters were reported by SaTScan. study were stored by arcGIS 10 software to create a spatial database. the global spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using the package of Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran\u2019s I) in ArcGIS 10. the reverse distance between two areas was considered as the conceptualization of spatial relationship. most likely clusters and secondary clusters were reported by SaTScan. the likelihood function is maximized over all window locations and sizes. secondary clusters were detected in the same way as for the most likely cluster. the higher the absolute value of Global Moran\u2019s I, the stronger a spatial autocorrelation exists. there were no trend on new SS+ notification rate in global spatial autocorrelation (t=1.29, p=0.25). the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate (Figure 2-B) had different distribution from that of new SS+ notification rate (Figure 2-A) the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate were in two extreme regions: (1) northeast of China including Heilongjiang province and the parts of Inner Mongolia and Jilin province. the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate had two more large clustering centers in Inner Mongolia, Gangsu and Qinghai province. the global Moran\u2019s I of total TB notification rate increased from 2005 to 2011. the higher the absolute value of Global Moran\u2019s I is, the stronger a spatial autocorrelation exists. Spatial-temporal clustering analysis by SaTScan indicated that the most likely clusters with high rates of new SS+ notification and total TB notification respectively. the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate (Figure 2-B) had different distribution from that of new SS+ notification rate (Figure 2-A) global spatial clustering analysis by Global Moran\u2019s I In general, the significant global spatial autocorrelation existed in new SS+ notification rate and total TB notification rate from 2005 to 2011 respectively. the higher the absolute value of Global Moran\u2019s I is, the stronger a spatial autocorrelation exists. most likely clusters with high rates of new SS+ notification and total TB notification respectively were located spatially in the south-central regions of china from 2006 to 2008. but the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate had different distribution from that of new SS+ notification rate (Figure 2-A) new SS+ TB as numerator of new SS+ notification rate is one part of Total TB as numerator of total TB notification rate. total TB includes SS+ TB, SS- TB, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB. clusters were in the relatively poor provinces with less techinques of TB diagnosis and treatment. total TB notification rate lumps together SS- cases, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB besides SS+. this was associated with more clustering as shown in Figure 2-B. sputum smear\u2013negative TB are less infectious than patients with sputum smear\u2013positive TB. this may suggest close contacts of patients with positive smear were more likely to develop TB disease[25] areas of clusters for new SS+ notification rate had more risks of TB transmission than the other areas. a handful focused on TB have been conducted[30], especially in china. some previous studies focused on small geographical areas and lacked coverage. the cost-effectiveness would be achieved if more resources and effective measures were provided and implemented in these clusters. the experience and methods of TB clusters detection and analysis in this study will benefit other high TB burden countries as well."}
