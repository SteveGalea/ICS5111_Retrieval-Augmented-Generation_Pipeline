{"summary": "SKH1-hr mice were 5 weeks old and weighed 20-23 g. five to 6 mice were housed in each cage, kept under conventional conditions in specific pathogen-free facilities. four mice were allocated to test and control groups. the irradiation dose was prescribed at the half-thickness of the buttock of each animal, which was equivalent to the Dmax (Depth of maximum dose, 1.5 cm) of a 6 megavoltage X-ray beam. each tissue was ground in 3 or 7 volumes (v/w) 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.85) the protocol for native-PAGE was followed by a Mighty Small II (SE 250, Hoefer Sci. Instr., San Francisco, CA) and a thermostatic circulator (EYELA CA-1100, Rikakikai Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) samples containing 7.5%T and 2.67%C separation gel and 3%T and 2.67%C stacking gel were prepared. samples with 25% sucrose and 0.025% BPB were electrophoresed on the 4 isozymes were assayed using anti-LDH A4 isozyme [22] and anti-B4 isozyme [23] after washing, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr. the mice were 5 weeks old and weighed 20-23 g. X-irradiation Irradiation was limited to the dorso-posterior region to minimize the exposure of the internal organs. a linear accelerator was used to X-irradiate the mice at a dose rate of 3 Gy/min, 12 Gy/day for four consecutive days. each tissue was ground in 3 or 7 volumes (v/w) 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.85) phosphate buffer (pH 6.85) containing 1.50 mM pyruvate and 0.14 mM NADH. changes in absorbency at 340 nm were measured using a spectrophotometer. one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme activity catalyzing conversion of 1 mole of substrate per min. membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS for 1 hr. membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr. spleen weights were significantly reduced immediately after the last irradiation. thereafter, the weights increased until 24 days after the first irradiation. data are expressed as meansSD (n=4). LDH A4 isozyme was expressed predominantly in the skeletal muscle, liver, and spleen tissues, while the B4 isozyme was expressed predominantly in the testis (Figure 3). Western blotting of the skeletal muscle (a), heart (b), kidney (c), liver (d), spleen (e), testis (f), and blood serum (g) Changes in LDH activities in the serum were not affected by irradiation. serum of SKH1-hr mice radiodermatitis model Days after X-irradiation, sham-irradiated control. *Represents P0.05 compared with the sham-irradiated control. LDH activities and protein concentrations of tissues in SKH1-hr mice were 189.45, 59.81, 81.61, 120.00, 35.88, 16.67, and 0.57 units/mg respectively. protein concentrations in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, testis, and blood serum were 42.18, 50.19, 86.38, 125.60, 127.02, 46.44, and 41.68 mg/ LDH activities in the serum were not affected by irradiation. the LDH A4 isozyme was reduced on day 24 after the first irradiation. the B4 isozyme increased on day 24 and the LDH C4 isozyme changed slightly. radiodermatitis was observed 24 days after the first X-irradiation. this difference is likely due to differences in the dose prescription point. spleen weight increased immediately after the last X-irradiation. each LDH isozyme was identified by native-PAGE and western blot analysis. our result is similar to the results of previous studies that used other mouse strains. an especially high immunoreactivity was observed between the B4 isozymes of SKH1-hr mice and an eye-specific LDH C4 isozyme in greenlings."}
