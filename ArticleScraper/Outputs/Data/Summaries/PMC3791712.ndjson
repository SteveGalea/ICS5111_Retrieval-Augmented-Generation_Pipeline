{"summary": "Xing Xie et al. have created a hybrid battery device that derives energy from wastewater. at the battery\u2019s anode, microorganisms oxidize organic matter. the electrons pass through an external circuit, where they are available for use as electrical energy, and then return to a solid-state electrode within the battery. all six animals treated with the IVR remained virus-free after 16 weekly vaginal exposures to simian-HIV, a virus containing genes from HIV and its primate equivalent, SIV. 11 of the 12 untreated animals became infected after approximately 4 viral exposures. authors suggest an IVR that continuously releases TDF may be an effective tool to prevent sexual transmission of HIV in humans. the authors report that the bat infection patterns resembled human hepatitis. antisera from humans successfully vaccinated against HBV failed to block the infection of cultured human liver cells. MERS-CoV, a recently detected group 2c human betacoronavirus, has been linked to at least 94 confirmed cases and 46 deaths. the alarming mortality rate combined with the virus\u2019 confirmed mechanism of human-to-human transmission has led to an urgent need for diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines."}
