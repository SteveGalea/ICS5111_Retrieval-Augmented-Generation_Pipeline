{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses account for a significant portion of the total viral diseases affecting humans around the world. the flaviviridae family is composed of four viral genera, including Flavivirus and Hepacivirus. the virus-induced MW is essential for the viral replication cycle and harbours compartments physically separated from the surrounding cytosol. the architecture and topology of the MW has been extensively studied. but the spatial organization and function of its various membrane structures is still poorly understood. the precise role of DMVs in the viral life cycle and the spatial organization of different viral processes within the MW have not yet been described. RNA viruses have developed strategies to block or avoid PRR initiated host responses. both HCV and DENV proteases cleave critical molecules involved in the early stages of RLR signalling pathways. evasion by hiding viral PAMPs from PRRs has also been postulated for a number of other viruses. us contain nuclear export signals (NESs) that bind exportins. many viral proteins interact with components of the NPC or nuclear transport pathway. in most cases, these interactions reflect either a nuclear phase of the viral infection or a host-viral protein interaction that alters nuclear transport pathways. studies have reported that the MW appears to protect viral proteins and RNA from exogenously added nucleases. this compartmentalization is also supported by our observation that HCV proteins present in the MW appear in regions of the cytoplasmic largely devoid of microtubules. uninfected and HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells were transfected with constructs coding for MDA5. replicon cells harboured the JFH-1 subgenomic replicon. replicon cells are restricted from accessing regions of the cytoplasm. we used a point mutant of RIG-I (RIG-I-K270A) that can still bind to viral RNA but lacks helicase activity necessary for tracking along the RNA strand and downstream immune signalling. the subcellular localization of Rig-I-K270A was similar to that of the RIG-I in uninfected and HCV-infected cells. uninfected and HAV-infected cells were transfected 5 days after viral infection with constructs encoding the catalytically inactive FLAG-tagged RIG-I-K270A. on day 7 after viral infection, localization of RIG-I-K270A (green) and either HAV capsid protein (red, panel A) or dsRNA (red, panel B) were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using specific antibodies the cells were examined by in situ hybridization using positive-strand or negative-strand RNA probes. in all cases, percent overlap is calculated from 15 cells. in cells analyzed for the localization of NS5A, RIG-I-K270A, and negative-strand HCV RNA. uninfected and HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding for FLAG-tagged RIG-I-K207A 2 days after HCV infection. cells were probed with antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope (grey) and either HCV core or NS5A (green) DNA probes targeted to either the positive-strand or the negative-strand of the HCV RNA (red) were then hybridized to the viral RNA. both of the \u2018microsomal\u2019 and \u2018MAM\u2019 fractions are predicted to contain membranes with unique characteristics arising during the HCV-induced changes in cellular membrane structure. we observed an enrichment of viral polymerase NS5B in the microsomal membrane fractions, but only low levels of core and NS3. core and NS3 but not NS5B, were enriched in the MAM fraction. total cell lysates isolated from uninfected (UN) or HCV-infected (HCV) cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation. western blotting with antibodies specific for the indicated proteins was used to evaluate their relative amounts. the microsomal fraction is primarily found in the microsomal fraction. the majority of membrane-bound viral RNA is associated with the microsomal fraction. the concentration of NS5B in this fraction suggests this RNA fraction includes replication complexes. the majority of the positive-strand RNA (76% of the fluorescent signal) was found in regions lacking ribosomal signal. a smaller pool of positive-strand RNA overlapped with the ribosomal S6 signal. a nuclear localization signal (NLS) allows access into the MW. the MW segregates activities associated with this structure from cytosolic factors including ribosomes and RLRs. previous results showed a reporter protein could enter regions of the cytoplasm occupied by the MW [37, 38]. in uninfected cells, both NLS-MDA5-I923V and NLS-RIG-I-K270A exhibited an increased nuclear signal over those not containing an NLS sequence. the level of overlap between these RLRs and NS5A significantly increased compared to RLRs lacking the NLS. uninfected or HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding for either GFP-tagged RIG-I-K270A (C) or GFP-tagged NLS-RIG-I-K270A (D) on day 4 after infection, localization of HCV NS5A protein (red) was compared to that of GFP-tagged RIG-I-K270A or NLS-RIG-I-K270A (green) two small molecule inhibitors, ivermectin and importazole, block transport function of the SV40 large T antigen NLS cognate nuclear import receptor, the importin / dimer. ivermectin or importazole were treated with either ivermectin or importazole for 3 hours. HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding for either GFP-tagged RIG-I-K270A or NLS-RIG-I-K270A 2 days after HCV infection. on day 4 after infection, cells were treated with 25 M ivermectin or 40 M importazole for 4 hours and then examined. we examined the localization of IRF-3 in uninfected cells expressing either RIG-I or NLS-RIG-I. the re-localization of IRF-3 to the nucleus is an initial step in RLR-mediated immune activation. this approach allowed us to assess activation of the immune response in individual cells determined to be both HCV-infected or uninfected. antibodies and indirect immunofluorescence and the GFP fusions were visualized directly using fluorescence confocal microscopy. cells were stained with antibodies directed against the HCV core protein (red) DNA was stained with DAPI (blue) and scale bars represent 5 m. the NLS tag stimulated only minimal changes in the levels of immune stimulated genes compared to those expressing wild type RIG-I. we then tested the consequences of expressing these various RIG-I constructs in HCV-infected cells. increased cellular levels of RIG-I caused a small, but significant decrease in HCV RNA levels. uninfected or HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding for FLAG-tagged RIG-I or V5-tagged MDA5. we visualized the cellular distribution of these RLRs by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. in uninfected cells, we observed a largely diffuse cytoplasmic localization for both RIG-I and MDA5. the localization of HCV proteins and RLRs in uninfected and HCV-infected cells was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. DNA was detected with DAPI (blue) and scale bars represent 5 m. a point mutant of RIG-I (RIG-I-K270A) can still bind to viral RNA but lacks helicase activity necessary for tracking along the RNA strand and downstream immune signalling. HAV infection induces cytoplasmic compartments lacking RIG-I All positive-strand RNA viruses reorganize host cell membranes. hepatitis A virus-infected cells showed exclusion of RIG-I-K270A from cytoplasmic regions enriched for HAV proteins. positive-strand RNA virus infection induces the formation of the MW to sequester viral processes from RLRs found in the surrounding regions of the cytoplasm. the localization of viral RNAs was detected using branched DNA probes directed against either the positive-strand or negative-strand of the HCV genome. the cells were then examined by in situ hybridization using positive-strand or negative-strand RNA probes. orescence signal from negative-strand probe overlapped with the RIG-I signal. 55% of positive-strand RNA fluorescence signal overlapped with the core protein signal. only 28% of positive-strand RNA signal overlapped with the RIG-I signal. cell fractionation reveals distinct compartments enriched for genome replication and viral assembly factors. this distribution is consistent with the various pathways in which both positive- and negative-strand viral RNA are used. the bulk of HCV proteins examined were contained within two cytoplasmic membrane fractions. we also evaluated the levels of total viral RNA and infections virus present in the various membrane fractions and cytosol. within the membrane fractions, we observed that higher levels of viral RNA were present in the microsomal fraction. however, approximately double the percentage of infectious virus was present in the MAM fraction. the number of infectious HCV particles in these same fractions was determined by infecting Huh7.5 cells with a portion of the sample from each fraction followed by counting focus-forming units identified using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. the separation of virus replication and assembly implies that host proteins required for these processes are present in in the microsomal and MAM fractions. in uninfected cells, ribosomes were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. however, in infected cells the vast majority of the S6 protein was excluded from regions of the cytoplasm containing the bulk of the HCV core protein. a portion of the viral positive-strand RNA colocalizes with RIG-I. this spatial separation between the MW and the bulk of the ribosomal proteins is consistent with a model in which translation occurs outside of the MW. the localization of the 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 (green), HCV core protein (panel A, red), HCV NS5A protein (panel B, red) in cells was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using specific antibodies. LR would overcome selective barrier between the cytoplasm and the MW [37, 38]. an extensively studied NLS derived from the SV40 large T antigen (here called simply the NLS) was used in the construction of various fusion proteins. the addition of an NLS to RLRs allowed the fusion protein to overcome the exclusion barrier normally preventing RLRs from entering the MW. uninfected and HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells were transfected with constructs encoding either V5-tagged MDA5-I923V (A) or V5-tagged NLS-MDA5-I923V (B) 2 days after HCV infection. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were determined to assess overlap of HCV NS5SA and either GFP or V5 fluorescence signals in confocal sections derived from HCV-infected cells expressing GFP-tagged RIG-I-K270A. the values presented represent an average over 10 images (> 15 cells) and the error bars indicate standard error. the degree of co-localization between RIG-I-K270A or NLS-RIG-I-K270A and NS5A in HCV-infected cells was similar to that presented Figs 1 and 6 (Fig 7 top panels) neither drug affected the distribution or the degree of overlap between RIG-I-I-K270A and NS5A. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were determined to assess overlap of HCV NS5SA and GFP signals in confocal images derived from HCV-infected cells expressing the indicated RIG construct. values presented represent an average over 10 images (at least 15 cells) and the error bars indicate standard error. the expression of NLS-RIG-I increases immune activation in HCV-infected cells to a greater extent than overexpression of wild-type RIG-I. uninfected or HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding either GFP-tagged RIG-I or GFP-tagged NLS-RIG-I. uninfected and HCV-infected cells were transfected with constructs encoding for GFP-RIG-I, GFP-NLS-RIG-I, GFP-SLN-RIG-I, or GFP-NLS-RIG-I-K270A 1 day after HCV infection. levels of intracellular HCV RNA were determined by qPCR. a proposed function of sequestering viral replication complexes away from the surrounding cytosol is the concealment of viral PAMPs from RLRs. this process is predicted to attenuate host cell innate immune activation. this barrier facilitates viral infection by inhibiting the access of RLRs to regions within the MW. fected cells inhibit immune activation by concealing viral dsRNA from cytosolic RLRs. despite apparent structural variability, membrane rearrangements induced by different positive-strand RNA viruses are likely to perform a universal function of concealing PAMPs from host RLRs as a means of immune evasion. s implies an enrichment of replication complexes, while the concentration of the core protein in a membrane fraction suggests that this membrane fraction is enriched for assembly complexes. further analysis of the subcellular fractions also revealed that host proteins which function in replication were found in the microsomal fraction and those involved in assembly (ApoE) were present in the MAM fraction. ours and numerous previous studies using either electron microscopy or immunofluorescence microscopy have outlined the complexity of the MW. we suggest that regions of functional compartmentalization within the MW can be more accurately defined by both the presence of specific HCV proteins or viral RNA, and the exclusion of RLRs (defined by ectopically expressed RIG-I-K270A) transport machinery appears to facilitate access to these MW compartments. a spatial separation of viral RNA replication and translation has been proposed. this is based on evidence that various positive-strand RNA virus replication complexes are composed of ribosome-free membranes. we have reported that HCV-infected cells exhibit increased levels of NPC proteins in regions of the cytoplasm occupied by the MW. we suggested that MW-associated NPCs would allow NLS-containing proteins, including several HCV proteins and nuclear factors important for viral infection, to move into and out of the MW. we have provided further evidence supporting a transport function for the MW-associated NPCs and soluble nuclear transport factors. previous analysis of the HCV-induced immune response showed that RIG-I activation in HCV-infected cells could occur through an interaction with viral RNA prior to the establishment of a fully compartmentalized MW. ssRNA, which can associate with and activate RIG-I in the absence of dsRNA, could passively or actively exit the MW to the surrounding cytosol. this could explain why it has been difficult to observe immune evasion through concealment of PAMPs current theories on HCV assembly and egress propose that HCV RNA moves with the core protein from replication compartments to sites of virus assembly. this idea is supported by several previous studies which indicate that viral maturation and assembly is mediated by the trafficking of proteins from replication compartments to lipid droplets. cytoplasmic RIG-I and MDA5 are restricted from entering regions of the cytoplasm occupied by various HCV proteins that serve as molecular markers for the MW. these results provided direct experimental evidence that the MW can function to limit access of innate immune receptors to viral RNA. ectopically expressed RLRs are excluded from multiple cytoplasmic regions. the nature of the barrier that defines the perimeter of multiple MW compartments is unclear. a spatial separation of viral RNA replication and translation has been proposed. a mechanism would require that some fraction of newly synthesized viral RNA be exported from the MW for translation. another pool is retained in the MW and targeted to viral assembly centers. the MW is also predicted to function as a barrier to molecules required for virus replication including entry into the MW of newly synthesized viral proteins. the addition of nuclear transport inhibitors suggests a role for the nuclear transport machinery in allowing access to the MW. these results are consistent with the NLS-RIG-I fusion protein gaining increased access to the MW and viral RNA. this suggests that virus-induced recruitment of NPCs appears to contribute to selective transport into the MW and to the HCV immune evasion strategy. LRs could only access viral positive-strand RNA, while double-stranded viral RNA is protected in the MW. the exclusion of RLRs from regions of the MW supports a role for this structure in the suppression of the innate immune response. our results further implicate components of the nuclear transport machinery in regulating movement of molecules across the MW barrier. qPCR was done using a SYBR green super mix (Quanta, 95070\u2013500) on a Stratagene Mx3005p real time PCR machine. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (invitrogen, 48190\u2013011) and superscript II (invitrogen, 18064014) for analysis of intracellular RNA transcript levels. constructs and transfection Expression constructs for production of FLAG-tagged RIG-I were prepared by first preparing PCR products of the entire RIG-I open reading frame from pEF-BOS RIG-I and pEF-BOS RIG-I (K270A) [78] into pEF-Tak encoding tandem FLAG epitope sequences in frame with the RIG-I protein under control of the elongation factor 1 promoter. the MDA5(I923V) mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the gateway cloning system (Invitrogen) the primes used for PCR amplification and site-directed mutagenesis are listed in S1 Table. the values for infectious titer represent the number of focus forming units per ml in the culture medium harvested from each of the coinfected samples. each experiment was repeated 3 times.
