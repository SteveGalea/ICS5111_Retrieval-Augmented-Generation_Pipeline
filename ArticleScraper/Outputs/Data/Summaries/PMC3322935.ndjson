{"summary": "study Primers and probe were selected in the N (nucleocapsid protein) gene region at the 3\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV genome by using Primer Express Software. a calibration standard was generated by PCR amplification of a 1,277\u2013bp fragment comprising part of the N open reading frame (ORF) and the 3\u2032 noncoding region (Co-STND-U275, 5\u2032-CCCGACGAGTGTGGTGGTG; Co-STND RNA from 140-L aliquots of each dilution was extracted and processed as above. clinical materials, including 326 fecal and 426 whole blood samples, were collected from Chaoyang Hospital, 301 Hospital, You\u2019an Hospital, and Xuanwu Hospital. 9 microliters total RNA was reverse transcribed (SuperScript II Transcriptase, Invitrogen) and 2 L of cDNA subjected to PCR by using a TaqMan Universal Master Mix kit (PE Applied Biosystems) thermocycling conditions were: 2 min 50\u00b0C (AmpErase UNG), 10 min 95\u00b0C (polymerase activation); 45 cycles of 15s 95\u00b0C denaturation. the threshold for detection of SARS-CoV in spiked fecal samples was 0.005 TCID50 (10\u20137 dilution; 1 TCID50/mL; 0.005 TCID50 per assay well) material from persons who had probable SARS included 326 fecal samples and 426 blood samples. the detection rate in fecal samples was 27% during the first 20 days after onset of symptoms. merase chain reaction; Ig, immunoglobulin; NA, not available. of the 16 fecal and 82 blood samples obtained from healthy persons, one blood sample yielded a positive result in RT-PCR. RT-PCR detection rate obtained in these samples was 63% for sputa and 15% for throat washing samples. RT-PCR analysis of blood was a less sensitive index of infection than immunologic assays at later time points (21\u201340 days after onset of symptoms) 16% of blood samples and 18% of fecal samples contained SARS-CoV RNA >31\u201340 days after onset of symptoms."}
