{"summary": "the effectiveness of collaboration reflects a successful implementation of planned actions and procedures to coordinate join activities among seemingly independent set of private and public agencies. an effective collaboration captures not only meaningful interactions previously developed by agencies but also a set of planned actions and procedures contributing to an effective cooperation among various levels of public agencies and private organizations during a crisis. this paper examines the advantages of collaboration in the arena of communicable diseases. the ICA framework has been rarely applied in other governmental settings. institutional actors may confront bargaining problems or effective monitoring mechanism if they do not have perfect information about other actors\u2019 behaviors. governmental agencies may lack the ability to negotiate division of benefits and costs without knowing about costs each actor is willing to pay for. monitoring an agreement is another challenge to intergovernmental cooperation. the commitment of an individual organization to work jointly during a crisis illustrates the advantage of bonding when risks of inaction by its members can be minimized through sanctions and reputational effects. the failure of one affects the ability of others to get the job done. the failure of one affects the ability of others to get the job done. network centrality provides an opportunity for an actor to access information and resources in a timely way from multiple actors. the focal actor is located at the central location of network can improve its reputation from others and can ensure cooperation from their partners. a public agency that has linkage with multiple organizations is better able to access core timely information because the focal agency can receive information directly from them. the higher the level of constraints, the lower the perceived level of collaboration effectiveness during a crisis. a public agency should be able to obtain core information that describes the nature of the problem and invest the given time and resources in responding to the immediate needs [36]. a higher level of network hierarchy means less redundant ties and a more efficient communication ties to access new information. the bonding effect fails to take into account the idea that an organization may be advantaged if it can communicate with an influential actor within a network. instead, the organization can create a communication linkage with the higher-level agencies instead of all organizations in the network. collaboration among public agencies facilitates a culture of responsiveness among first responders and responsible agencies. social media also enables members of the public to communicate their situations easily with government agencies and improve situational awareness of public health emergency response organizations. the focal actor is located at the central location of network can improve its reputation from others and ensure cooperation from their partners. the prominent actor can develop capacity to use information and resources from their partners by expanding expericence of creating and maintaing linkage with other actors. the focal actor can develop better understanding about a crisis by communicating with multiple organizations. the higher the level of constraints, the higher the perceived level of collaboration effectiveness will be during a crisis. a public agency should be able to obtain core information that describes the nature of the problem and invest the given time and resources in responding to the immediate needs [36]. the organization can create a communication linkage with the higher-level agencies instead of all organizations in the network. the linkage with the central actors enables the focal actor to obtain diverse information from the prominent actor that received information from heterogeneous set of other actors. the network hierarchy captures the logic of the bridging effect. social media enables members of the public to communicate their situations easily with government agencies and improve situational awareness of public health emergency response organizations. social media is also powerful means to involve members of the public in volunteering and donation for disaster response. the literature on risk communication provides clues on the mechanisms to enhance the effectiveness of intergovernmental collaboration. the first-MERS patient found that he had fever and visited five hospitals. the last hospital he visited identified that he had become infected with the virus. the national public health authority was not effective in controlling the transmission of infectious disease from the confirmation of the first case on 20 May 2015. the national government criticized the national government regarding the transparency regarding the hospitals with MERS infection. the information system did not allow local public health agencies to input their local risk information instantly. it was not able to integrate the local information and failed to provide up-to-date transmission information. public health agencies, 47 police agencies, and 32 local fire agencies did not have significant differences with non-responding agencies in term of socio-demographic characteristics. 19 other governmental agencies provided only network information but not complete information, including three national agencies and one regional agency. variables N Mean Std.

UCINET 6 (version 6.012, Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA, USA) was employed to calculate the normalized score. two dummy variables for organizational types were created for a local police agency and fire agencies. it was expected that the two types of local agencies may have differences with governmental agencies that led the outbreak response. population density was measured as the total population divided by the land area (km2). three national agencies and one regional agency used their responses to provide network information in order to construct the risk communication network. their responses were used to provide network information in order to construct the risk communication network. the number of agencies in the network is 154, with ties of 425. each agency has 2.76 ties with other agencies. the average length of the shortest path is 2.97 and the distance-based cohesion is 0.31. UCINET 6 (version 6.012, Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA, USA) was employed to calculate the normalized score. network constraint measures bridging effects that allow the focal node to access heterogeneous information through directly connected alters. a high level of network constraint means few structure holes and decreases the likelihood of a local bridging role. population density was measured as the total population divided by the land area (km2) and elderly population was measured as the proportion of elderly population to total population. it was also expected that local agencies that served densely populated area or a large proportion of senior population will face challenges when responding to the outbreak. the number of agencies in the network is 154, with ties of 425. on average, each agency has 2.76 ties with other agencies. average length of the shortest path is 2.97 and distance-based cohesion 0.31. UCINET 6 (version 6.012, Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA, USA) was employed to calculate the normalized score, which is degree divided by maximum possible number of nodes. network constraint is the extent to which the focal node is connected to others that are connected to each other. a high level of network constraint means few structure holes and decreases the likelihood of a local bridging role. population density was measured as the total population divided by the land area (km2) and elderly population was measured as the proportion of elderly population to total population. local agencies that served densely populated area or a large proportion of senior population will face challenges when responding to the outbreak. a local public health agency had confusion in sharing information about period and termination date of quarantines with police or fire agencies. the supporting agencies did not have the same information standard for reporting the quarantine start and termination dates. explaining collaboration effectivenesss (all cases) model 2 results confirm the second hypothesis that the lower the level of constraints, the higher the perceived level of collaboration effectiveness during the crisis. the coefficient of network constraint is 6.862 and is significant at the levels of 0.01 in Model 2. model 6 confirms the hypothesized effects of network hierarchy on interagency collaboration effectiveness among local public health agencies. the coefficient of network hierarchy is 13.53 and significant at the level of 0.05. public health agencies with populous local jurisdictions tend to have high levels of interagency collaboration effectiveness. interagency risk communication strategies and online risk communication are important means to improve interagency effort toward a virus outbreak. public agencies need to take adequate interagency risk communication strategies to access core information to prevent the transmission of an infectious disease that has a transboundary nature. online media allows the public agency to disseminate up-to-date risk information to residents. the study has several limitations in testing the effects of the communication strategies and online channel use on intergovernmental collaboration effectiveness."}
