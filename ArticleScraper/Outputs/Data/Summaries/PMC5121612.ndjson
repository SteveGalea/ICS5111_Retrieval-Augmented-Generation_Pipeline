{"summary": "amino acid sequence of major lymphocyte surface markers, cytokines and transcriptional factors was aligned with that of their human and mouse counterparts. overall, the identity ranged from 44\u201395% with higher percentages systematically found between P. alecto and human compared to P. alecto and mouse. cytometry with P. alecto lymphocytes shows only 3 target surface molecules. the remaining 6 target intracellular molecules including the intracellular domain of CD3, transcription factors (T-bet, Gata-3 and Eomes), IL-10 and TNF cytokines. however, identification of cross-reactive antibodies against these molecules was unsuccessful. total bat splenocytes were first gated on live single cells. the total lymphocyte population was further defined by its forward and side laser light scatter properties. this cell population stained negative for IgG and CD11b, specific markers for B cells and myeloid cells. around 90% of the CD3 lymphocytes stained positive for both IgG and MHCII. a CD3 Tbet+ Eomes+ cell population was detected in bat spleen that could be regarded as NK cells. 4% and 25% of the CD3+ cells were CD8mRNA+ and CD4mRNA+ respectively. the fact that these percentages added up to 60% only of the total CD3+ population suggests lower sensitivity of flow-FISH assay compared to antibody staining. however, it is possible to analyze sub-populations within specific cell subset identified by Flow-FISH. spleens stained with CD3, Tbet, Eomes and Gata3 antibodies. in-situ hybridization with probes specific for CD4mRNA (a) and CD8mRNA (b). majority of CD4mRNA+ T cells are Tbet Gata3 Eomes triple negative. a substantial proportion of CD4mRNA+ T cells express Gata3. Tbet Eomes Gata3 triple negative as well as Gata3+ single positive T cells (both subsets assumed to be CD4+ T cells) in PBMCs, the data suggest a predominance of CD8+ T cells in the bat spleen. MLNs harbor similar proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. over 30% of the total leukocytes present in bats bone marrow are CD3+ T cells. this is twice the percentage found in mice at steady state. a significant proportion of CD3+ T cells (22.3%) in P. alecto spleen was found to express MHCII. individual percentages of MHCII+ and MHCII CD3+ splenocytes from one bat based on detection of MHCII and CD3+ molecules. spleen, MLN, PBMCs and BM from 3\u20134 bats. granzyme B and perforin (cytolytic molecules mainly produced by CD8+ T cells and NK cells10,37,38), IL-17A and IL-22 (inflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells) a great proportion of the CD3+ cells present in the spleen produced TNF and IFN- (Fig. 5a,b), whereas a smaller percentage produced IL-10 (Fig. 5c). IL-17a (g), IL-22 (h) and TGF-1 (i) were detected at the mRNA level by Flow-FISH. CD3+ cells producing IL-2, granzyme B and perforin mRNA were also detected in PBMCs stimulated with PDBu/iono. cells were gated on CD3 MHCII+ (B cells) (a,b) or CD3 Tbet+ Eomes+ (NK cells) production of intracellular TNF (a,c), IL-10 (b), IFN- (d) was done at the protein level. production of granzyme B and perforin (e) was performed at the mRNA level by Flow-FISH. allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), \u201cstimulator cells\u201d (prepared from another bat spleen) were co-cultured for 5 days with cell Trace Violet-labeled \u201cresponder cells\u201d (red) or were cultured alone in media (grey) Graphs shown represent cells gated on CD3+ cells. mouse with sequence identity ranging from 88\u201395%, while it was lower for surface markers (44\u201378%). high sequence identity was also found between bat TNF and IL-10. antibody targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 molecule was unsuccessful. antibody targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 molecule cross-reacted with its bat counterpart. however, since human/mouse antibodies failed to detect major lymphocyte surface markers CD4 and CD8 from bat lymphocytes, a strategy based on expression of transcription factors was adopted. Tbet, Eomes and Gata3-specific staining of the CD3+ population indicated a prominent (58%) Tbet+ Eomes+ double positive population in this particular bat spleen. the percentages of both cell populations were relatively low compared to the Tbet+ Eomes+ CD3+ lymphocytes. a CD3 Tbet+ Eomes+ cell population was detected in bat spleen. the percentage of this cell population among the lymphocyte region was comparable to that reported for mouse spleen31,32. the differential expression of these transcription factors is for now the only means to identify this immune cell population. majority (75%) of the CD3+ CD8mRNA+ cells co-expressed Tbet and Eomes, and only about 1% expressed Gata3. this result thus validates our FACS strategy based on the differential expression of Eomes, Tbet and Gata3 to identify the CD8+ T cell population. a substantial proportion of CD4mRNA+ T cells express Gata3 or Tbet and Eomes. differential expression patterns of the transcription factors Tbet, Eomes and Gata3 in various organs of P. alecto. a predominance of CD8+ T cells in the bat spleen, whereas bone marrow and PBMCs display majority of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. MLNs harbor similar proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. a significant proportion of CD3+ T cells (22.3%) in P. alecto spleen was found to express MHCII. this is consistent with the fact that we were unable to find the thymus in these wild caught bats. bet and Eomes expression in MHCII+ and MHCII CD3+ splenocytes varied between bats and between organs. however, these percentages varied between bats and between organs. cross-reactive anti-human TNF and anti-human IL-10 antibodies were used to detect the production by flow cytometry. TNF production in CD3+ MHCII+ cells ranged from 23.6% in Tbet Eomes Gata3 (representing CD4+ T cells) to 73.5% in Tbet Eomes+ T cells (possibly representing CD8+ memory T cells) however, those percentages varied greatly from one bat to another. increased levels of IL-17A, IL-22 and TGF- mRNA was detected in 40% of total CD3+ T cells. this observation may indicate a strong bias of CD4+ T cell towards the Th17 and Treg subsets in bat spleen in comparison to mouse and human spleen. the main lymphocyte populations in bats are able to produce effector molecules. proliferative capacity of bat immune cells was also evaluated. splenocytes were labeled with Cell Trace Violet and stimulated for 5 days. proliferation of the responder cells after 5 days of co-culture was measured by flow cytometry, gating on CD3+ cells. a handful of studies conducted in the 80s and early 90 s described lymphocyte-like cells in Pteropus bats based on morphological evidence. characterization of major adaptive immune cell populations in the fruit-eating bat P. alecto. we report the use of cross-reactive antibodies that allow the identification of various T cells subsets, B cells and NK cells. this work opens up possibilities for measuring functional aspects of bat immune cells. marrow is reported to be 1 to 235, as opposed to the 2:1 ratio found in bats. on-going infection, inflammation and/or autoimmunity could explain the high number of CD4+ T cells in the bone marrow of these wild caught bats47,48,49,50. likewise, predominance of CD8+ T cells in the spleen from these animals may indicate the presence of viruses in this organ or may represent the immune steady state of the bat s characterization of bat B cells includes assessing the ability of these cells to present antigens and to respond to specific stimulation such as TLR agonists or anti-Ig antibodies. co-incubation of bat splenocytes with murine IL-2 (mIL-2), a well-known growth factor for T cells, led to greater proliferation of T cells. animals P. alecto bats were caught in Queensland (Australia) and transported to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), CSIRO (Victoria, Australia) only bats testing negative for Hendra virus (HeV) and Lyssavirus were included in the study. for staining of surface markers, cells were incubated first with primary antibodies (Table S2) including anti-mouse I-A/I-E MHC class II (clone 2G9, BD), polyclonal anti-bat IgG (Novus Biologicals, NB7237), anti-mouse CD11b and anti-mouse CD44 (clone IM7, BD) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. monensin and brefeldin A (eBioscience) were added during the last 2 h of the stimulation. the antibodies were anti-human TNF (clone Mab11, BD), anti-human IL-10 (clone JES3\u201319F1, Biolegend) and anti-bat IFN- (clone 2G645, a kind gift from CSIRO) mixed Lymphocyte Reaction Splenocytes (1 107/ml in PBS) were incubated with Cell Trace Violet (0.5 M final concentration) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. after two washes with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS the cells were resuspended in culture media, seeded at 5 105 cells per well in a 96-U bottom plate and cultured for 5 days. P. alecto nucleotide sequences were translated into protein sequences using the Expasy Translate Tool program. single cell suspension from spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone marrow or blood stained with Fixable Viability Dye e780 (eBioscience) for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, then 10% FBS was added. anti-CD3 (clone CD3\u201312, Abcam), anti-mouse Eomes (clone Dan11mag), anti-human/mouse Tbet (clone 4B10), and anti-human/mouse Gata3 (clone TWAJ) antibodies were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise stated. cells were then incubated with anti- CD3, Tbet, Eomes and Gata3 antibodies for 30 min at RT, followed by in-situ hybridization with the Alexa Fluor 647-labelled oligo probes. analysis was done using LSRFortessa X-20 (BD) and Flowjo software. hed and co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with 5 105 cells previously labeled with Cell Trace Violet from the other bat preparation (responder cells) cells were stained with specific antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry."}
