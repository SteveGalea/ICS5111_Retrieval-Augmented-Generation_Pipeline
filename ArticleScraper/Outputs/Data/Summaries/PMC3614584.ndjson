{"summary": "indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the SARS coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in sera of 1700. 90% of 257 patient serum specimens after 20 days of disease onset showed positive SARS-CoV IgG either using ELISA or IFA. 257 SARS serum samples belonged to infectors hospitalized respectively. 935 were from servicemen quartered in Hongkong and 158 from those quartered in Macao in 2003. 160 were from medical practitioners around Peking that having close contact with SARS infectors. a 10-l volume of labeled antigen was added to the well coated with recombinant N protein. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. samples with an A450 of >0.15 (average A450+5 standard deviation of 900 samples from healthy people) were considered positive. antigen -capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (3) was established for the detection of anti-N protein antibody present in sera. a 100-l volume of serum was added to the well coated with recombinant N protein, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. a 10-l volume of labeled antigen was added to the well coated with recombinant N protein, and the plate was incubated for another 30 min and then washed five times ELISA and IFA tested 200 healthy people with both methods of ELISA and IFA. the results were all negative. the results were detailed in Table 1. 4.8 1120 37 33 89.0 33 89.0 21260 177 160 90.4 159 90.0 22720 14 14 100 14 100 14 100 Patients\u2019 serum results detected by ELISA There were 257 SARS cases diagnosed by ELISA. we followed 43 cases of them (after onset of disease, 3-360 days), the result showed that serum IgG antibodies titer was lifted with time went on in the first 4 to 6 months. most of the patients\u2019 antibodies lift to the top angzhou 200 0 0 200 0 0 The positive rate of serum SARS antibodies in patients we Traced for patients\u2019 serum antibodies using both ELISA and IFA. 17 serum samples of the 43 cases got positive antibodies, the positive rate was 39.8%. 15 cases were positive by IFA, the positive rate was 34.8%. seroepidemiological study is the important method to study infectious disease and the prevalence rules. in order to cognize roundly the rules of Serum IgG antibodies and infection charts after onset of SARS, indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect in sera of 1710. 257 patients from 3 to 360 days after onset of SARS increased their serum antibodies titers in 4 to 6 months. the antibodies of most patients reached the peak in the 6th month."}
