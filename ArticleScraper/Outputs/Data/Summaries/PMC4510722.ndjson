{"summary": "protease inhibitors like cystatins, especially cystatin C (cys C) are abundantly present in human seminal plasma. the role of this protein against herpes simplex virus is not well studied. TZM-bl cells, HIV viruses (HIV-1 93IN101 and HIV-193IN105), HIV protease and peptide substrate for HIV-protease and Darunavir (Prezista, TMC 114) were kind gifts from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectivity dose) was calculated using the Spearman-Karber method14. cells contain HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven -galactosidase (-gal) and firefly luciferase reporter cassettes. blots were washed thrice with 0.1 per cent tween-20 in PBS (tween-PBS), incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C in 1:6000 diluted HRP (horse radish peroxidase)-labelled rabbit anti-goat antibody (Bangalore Genie, Bengaluru, India) after washing thrice with tween-PBS, the blots were visualized using X the supernatant thus obtained was diluted 1:3 (v/v) with 0.02 M PBS, pH 7.2 and fractionated using the same buffer. the fractions were dialyzed against distilled water to remove excess salt. immunoglobulins were purified from serum of rabbit immunized with cys C19. immunoglobulins were loaded on the column and incubated overnight. cys C bound to the column was eluted using elution buffer. the oligopeptide (H-Arg-Lys-Ile-Leu-Phe(NO2)-Leu-Asp-Gly-NH2) is based on the reverse transcriptase-endonuclease cleavage site in the Pr160 Gag-pol of HIV-1. a continuous decrease of absorbance at 310 nm occurs during cleavage. 50 l of cys C (50 l) were added to the wells with different concentrations of cys C. cys C (50 l) was added to the wells with different concentrations of cys C. cys C (50 l) was added to the wells. fresh prepared MTT solution (10 l) was added to the wells and incubated for 3 h. 100 l of SDS-HCl solution was added and incubated for 4 h. maximum number of proteins in the range of 6-15 kDa were seen to be concentrated in fraction-4 (Fig. 2B, C) cys C, a protein of approximately 14 kDa was likely to be present, were concentrated in fraction-4 (Fr. 4) of the fractions purified by gel permeation chromatography by Western blot. cys C showed a dose-dependant decrease of blue-stained cells. cys C showed a dose-dependant decrease of blue-stained cells. cys C showed a dose-dependant decrease of blue-stained cells. cys C binds to various HIV proteins including HIV protease. cystatins are thought to be non-selective and inactivate proteases reversibly and competitively by indirect blockage of catalytic centers. cys C was found to bind to various HIV proteins like gp120 and gp160. therefore, it would be of interest to examine whether the binding of cys C to these proteins prevents the fusion of HIV virus with CD4+ cells thus potentially preventing entry within the cells."}
