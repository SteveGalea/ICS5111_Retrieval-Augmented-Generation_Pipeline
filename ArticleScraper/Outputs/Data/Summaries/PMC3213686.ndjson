{"summary": "loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a DNA amplification technique with high specificity, efficiency, and speed, performed under isothermal conditions. the software is available for download at http://lava-dna.googlecode.com/. primerExplorer doesn't support IUPAC characters other than \"ATCG\" in the input sequence. david frum: it's less suited for high throughput analysis since it is limited to a single execution process on a computer, accepts only up to 2,000 bp sequences, and outputs only HTML. he says this is a multiple-S. equence Alignment (MSA) approach to LAMP signature design can be used as input. individual sequences from the MSA are used for primer enumeration. combinations of primers for the roles of inner, loop, middle, and outer are analyzed. SLAVA splits the MSA into sections, executes LAVA for each individual section, and combines the results into a single set of non-identical signatures. each sub-analysis can identify more primer candidate regions, because each sub-analysis can identify more primer candidate regions. primer analysis and scoring is performed by the OligoEnumerator modules. a maximum poly-base restriction is enforced, limiting number of consecutive identical bases in a potential primer region. the primerAnalyzer penalty for individual primers is simply the Primer3 penalty score. the amount of overlap permitted is set for each iteration based on a \"schedule\" of primer overlap percentages. long MSAs can sometimes be used as input, but have heavy computer resource requirements. using long MSAs can result in fewer identified signature candidates. Default primer design parameters are listed in Table 1. defaults should only be considered as a starting point for signature identification. a wide range of parameters yield successful primer assays. the PrimerAnalyzer penalty for individual primers in this version of LAVA is simply the Primer3 penalty score. the penalty is returned as PrimerInfo objects, which are used to provide primer sequence information for signature output. each primer combination process is repeated with different primer overlap cutoff percentages. locus we targeted is an 800 base-pair long sequence of Staphylococcus aureus. locus is a place where a KPATH [7] run identified a TaqMan signature candidate that is both conserved among all targets. locus is a place where a KPATH [7] run identified a TaqMan signature candidate. complete genome 57650036 NC_002951.2 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MRSA252, complete genome 49484912 NC_002953.3 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MSSA476, complete genome 87159884 NC_007793.1 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300, complete genome 151220212 NC_009641.1 Staphylococc the LAVA selection for a lamp signature is nearly identical to the PrimerExplorer selection, as seen in Figure 3. we believe the variations between result sets are the result of subtle differences in calculation methods for primer metrics, and would not represent a significant difference in signature behavior. a pre-computed MSA of all 25 completed Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes available was used as input, including known drug-resistant genomes. non-unique regions were masked out so only unique sequence is used for signature design.

LAVA currently excludes dimerization checks during primer selection. this would have been accomplished using the UNAFold [10] libraries to analyze inter-oligo interactions. this is currently omitted because in some instances, the increase in required processing time was unacceptable. the chance of this being a problem increases if the number of consecutive identical bases in the designed primers cannot be limited. a more context-aware linker design should yield better results than always using a single linker sequence. one potential approach is to design linkers that are the least complimentary to the loop regions adjacent to the F1 region in the LAMP dumbbell structures. LAVA is available as open source, downloadable from the project home page. the focus of LAVA is to improve on other currently available software by accommodating high-throughput signature design, while providing a framework to develop more sophisticated algorithmic and analytical tools. 4."}
