{"summary": "influenza A virus consists of 17 HA and 10 NA subtypes. oseltamivir-resistant and amantadine-resistant variants emerge. virus replicates in mucosal epithelial cells of upper and lower airways, lung pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, mucous glands, and lymph nodes. a novel avian-origin influenza A virus causes an outbreak with severe and fatal respiratory diseases in China in 2013 [18], becoming global public health concerns. new therapies and vaccines against influenza infection become urgent. ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH) and chloroform extracts against influenza A virus subtypes such as pandemic 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2. HA subtype of all influenza A viruses used was confirmed by RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR with specific primers. S. baicalensis extracts and indicated flavonoids were dissolved in 200 mL ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH), or chloroform. each lyophilized extract powder was kept at 20\u00b0C; stock solutions (1 mg/mL) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and sterilized using a 0.44 m syringe filter were stored at 80\u00b0C until used chroomatographic separation is set at 1.0 mL/min flow rate. elution peaks are detected at 280 nm, and each peak area is autocalculated with a 2996 PDA detector. serial 10-fold dilution of viruses (106 PFU/mL) was added to the wells of a 96-well plate, mixed with MUNANA solution at final concentration of 300 M. flavonoids were cultured in 96-well plates, followed by 48 h incubation. each well had 5 L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) added for another 3 h. each well had 5 L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) added for another 3 h. each well had 5 L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) added for another 3 h. apigenin (0, 10, 100, or 200 M), or chrysin (0, 10, 100, or 200 M) was added to MDCK cells cultured in 6-well plates during (simultaneous treatment) and 1 h after (postinfection treatment) infection with pandemic 2009 H1N1 at MOI 1. neuraminidase NA1 (PDB: 3cl0), NA2 (PDB: 4gzp) and NA9 (PDB: 3nn9) were used as targets for molecular docking. docking calculations of neuraminidase NA1 (PDB: 3cl0), NA2 (PDB: 4gzp) and NA9 (PDB: 3nn9) were performed. HA subtype of all influenza A viruses used was confirmed by RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR with specific primers. dilution of penicillin-streptomycin solution (HyClone) and 250 g/mL amphotericin was used for influenza A virus amplification and plaque assays. fingerprint profiles of S. baicalensis extracts were analyzed and compared with retention time of marker compounds, using a quaternary pump (pump L-2130), a UV detector (L-2400), and a Waters XBridge C18 column (5 m, 4.6 100 mm, Waters) concentration of each extract or flavonoid showing 50% inhibitory effect (IC50) compared to control with no inhibitor was determined by computer program. each well had 5 L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) added for another 3 h, incubated, and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline.
