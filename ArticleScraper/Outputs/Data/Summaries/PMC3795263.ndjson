{"summary": "cell adhesion is a fundamental activity required for the correct functioning of virtually every process in the multicellular organism. despite this central role, the molecular events that govern intercellular binding and translate this event to intracellular signals with the potential to control cellular growth, differentiation, and development often remain only superficially defined. an emerging appreciation that the misregulation of individual cell adhesion molecules can contribute to pathologies as disparate as cancer, inflammation, pathogenic infections, and autoimmune disease. studies by various groups suggest that CEACAM1 may exert either inhibitory or activating functions on the cell. a plausible explanation is that different oligomeric states of CEACAM1 may recruit different effectors to elicit opposing signaling responses. oligomers may be disassociated; yet they do not consider what motivates dimerization. lack of understanding regarding how cell adhesion molecule oligomerization influences the outcome of cell-cell binding is currently the greatest hurdle to understanding their function in health and disease. c antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) c antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) cDNAs were amplified from CEACAM1\u20134L originally cloned into the pRC/CMV vector. 36L-CEACAM1\u20134L variant was generated using the QuikChange\u00ae site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) the oligonucleotide primers used to create amino acid substitutions at positions 432 and 436 of the transmembrane domain of CEACAM1\u20134L are shown in supplemental Table S1.

HeLa cells transfected with CEACAM1\u20134L, R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L, or G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were prepared as single cell suspensions and then allowed to aggregate. images of cell cultures taken at indicated time points are represented as a pie chart. each value is a mean of triplicate samples and are representative of three independent experiments. fected with pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L or pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min. cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse cDNAs were amplified via PCR (5\u2032 primers contained a Kozak sequence, GCCACCATG, for protein expression) and subcloned into pMSCV Puro retroviral expression vector (Clontech) the variants of human CEACAM1\u20134L, CEACAM1\u20134S (CEACAM1 with short cytoplasmic domain) and truncated CEACAM1 (CEACAM1 lacking the complete cytoplasmic domain pEYFP-tagged CEACAM1 variants were cloned into pMSCV-Puro vector. c-Myc-tagged CEACAM1\u20134L was constructed by PCR addition of the c-Myc protein-derived peptide sequence to the C terminus of CEACAM1\u20134L. cross-linking was initiated by the addition of dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate (DSP) at 500 m or at the indicated concentrations. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, before immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation studies. antigen-specific primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. unless otherwise noted, HeLa cells transfected with the indicated CEACAM1 mutant constructs were incubated in PBS/Mg/Ca with 1 m ionomycin (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) cells were stained with 20 g/ml CEACAM-specific mAb D14HD11. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl. SDS-PAGE immunoblots of nonreduced or reduced pellets were probed to detect CEACAM1 dimers and monomers using mAb against CEACAM1 (D14HD11; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) the association of Calmodulin HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cells were treated with the indicated amounts of ionomycin or W-7 for various periods of time. FRET Imaging Fluorescence anisotropy microscopy was performed on an LSM710 NLO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) cells were imaged in RPMI at room temperature using a 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat 63 oil immersion objective lens and pixel dwell time of 12.61 s. these images were collected from the bottom of the cell at the glass coverslip because this position provides a relatively flat field of the plasma membrane. fluorescent proteins have a long rotational correlation time compared with fluorescence lifetime. donor fluorescent proteins transfer energy to an acceptor through a dipole-dipole interaction. as a result, the emission becomes more randomized leading to a lower anisotropy. 1 106 cells of each transfected cell line were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.8% FBS, 10 mg/ml DNase, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with constant gentle rocking. images were taken on a Leica MZ16F stereomicroscope. cells were treated with 100 m pervanadate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were pelleted, and cellular proteins were cross-linked.

Ontario, Canada) truncated CEACAM1\u20134L was amplified from pMSCV-Puro-CEACAM1 by PCR splicing by overlap extension (31). the pMSCV-Puro-CEACAM1\u20134L variant was generated using the QuikChange\u00ae site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cloned into pMSCV Puro vector for generation of recombinant CEACAM1 alleles. cloned cells from a low (50%) confluence culture dish were resuspended using trypsin/EDTA. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, before immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation studies. cells were occasionally visually observed and counted before and after cross-linking to ensure no aggregation of the suspended cells had occurred. surface CEACAM1 was stained with the CEACAM-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) D14HD11 (20 g/ml) diluted in 3% FCS/PBS for 1 h on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab\u2032)2. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. mAb antibody specific for calmodulin (EP799Y; Abcam) two identical helices were generated from the primary sequence of the CEACAM1 TMD (residues 429\u2013451, inclusive), and dimers with either a right-handed or left-handed crossing angle was created. energy-minimized dimers were grouped into clusters of at least 10 structures with a cutoff of mean square deviation of 1. mVenus and yellow fluorescent protein excitation was achieved with the femtosecond laser set to 950 nm (36) fluorescence emission was collected using a two-channel LSM BiG GaASP detector (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) and a polarizing beam splitter (Edmund Optics) set to collect parallel (channel 1) and perpendicular (channel 2) emission (Chroma) cells expressing the Venus tandem dimer consistently exhibited a lower anisotropy value than cells expressing monomeric Venus. gentamycin-based assay to quantify viable total associated and intracellular bacteria was performed as described previously. images were taken on a leica MZ16F stereomicroscope. the numbers of cells per aggregate was calculated from 10 arbitrarily selected fields of view (500 cells per field) for each cell line. each value is a mean of triplicate samples. mice monoclonal anti-SH-PTP1 antibody (BD Biosciences), mouse monoclonal anti-SH-PTP2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and mouse monoclonal anti c-Src antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) proteins were also probed with mouse CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody (D14DH11, Genovac GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) stably transfected HeLa cell line expressing defined recombinant CEACAM1 (HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L) was described previously (29) cDNAs were amplified from CEACAM1\u20134L originally cloned into the pRC/CMV vector (30) and then subcloned into pMSCV-Puro vector. c-Myc-tagged CEACAM1\u20134L was amplified and cloned into pMSCV-Puro vector using restriction sites XhoI and EcoRI. c-Myc-tagged CEACAM1\u20134L was constructed by PCR addition of the c-Myc protein-derived peptide sequence to the C terminus of CEACAM1\u20134L. e strain MS11 was grown from frozen stocks on 1% (v/v) IsoVitaleXTM (BBLTM, BD Biosciences)-supplemented GC agar (Difco) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. cells from a low (50%) confluence culture dish were resuspended using trypsin/EDTA. c-Myc-containing proteins were recovered from lysates using anti-YFP antibody. total cell lysates were probed with mouse CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody. antigen-specific primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase. surface CEACAM1 was stained with the CEACAM-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) D14HD11 (20 g/ml) diluted in 3% FCS/PBS for 1 h on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab\u2032)2. cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. biotinylated surface proteins were pulled down using streptavidin-agarose (Sigma), and SDS-PAGE immunoblots of nonreduced or reduced pellets were probed to detect CEACAM1 dimers and monomers using mAb. molecular dynamics simulation, simulated annealing, and energy minimization were carried out for each step. the average structure of each cluster was calculated and refined by energy minimization. all simulations were conducted in vacuum (dielectric constant Z = 1) to mimic the low dielectric constant of the membrane core. polarizing beam splitter (Edmund Optics) set to collect parallel (channel 1) and perpendicular (channel 2) emission (Chroma) the calculation of anisotropy (r) for homo-FRET analysis was done using custom plug-ins written for ImageJ, National Institutes of Health (37). fluorescent proteins have a long rotational correlation time compared with fluorescence lifetime resulting in an intrinsically high steady-state anisotropy. cells were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.8% FBS, 10 mg/ml DNase and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with constant gentle rocking. dilutions were plated in triplicate on GC agar plates to determine the number of recovered viable bacteria. cells transfected with CEACAM1\u20134L, R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L, or G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were prepared as single cell suspensions. images of cell cultures taken at indicated time points are represented as a pie chart. each value is a mean of triplicate samples and are representative of three independent experiments. pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h. cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. the human ectocervical (Ect1/E6E7) and vaginal (Vk2/E6E7) epithelial cells, which naturally express CEACAM1, were exposed to DSP. total cell lysates were resolved under nonreducing (panel i) or reducing (panel ii) conditions by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1. pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L and CEACAM1\u20134L-myc were co-transfected into HeLa cells. immunoprecipitation of the chemically cross-linked lysates led to the recovery of pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L. to confirm the effect of calmodulin on human CEACAM1 dimerization, the cells were treated with calmodulin antagonist, W-7. when used alone, W-7 does not have any apparent effect on the level of CEACAM1 dimerization. the cells were incubated with W-7 and then exposed to ionomycin. ionomycin was used at 10 m for B but used at 1 m for all other experiments. immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1. results cannot distinguish between cis- (parallel) and trans- (anti-parallel) interactions. surface expression of CEACAM1\u20134L was unaffected by treatment of HeLa cells expressing R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L with ionomycin or W-7. surface proteins were labeled by exposing HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cells to membrane-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC-LC- ionomycin treatment caused a rapid decrease in CEACAM1 dimers at the cell surface. surface dimers were apparent under both conditions. ionomycin and W-7 did not affect surface CEACAM1 uptake or degradation. transfected HeLa cells expressing a natural splice variant of CEACAM1 containing a short cytoplasmic domain, 10 amino acids (CEACAM1\u20134S) (B) or a recombinant form completely lacking a cytoplasmic domain (truncated CEACAM1) (C) were either untreated or treated with ionomycin or W-7. proteins were cross-linked with DSP. peptides synthesized to reflect the 10 most membrane-proximal amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 (55) can be binding to peptides synthesized to reflect the 10 most membrane-proximal amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 (55) we expressed a recombinant (non-natural) truncated form of CEACAM1 that completely lacks the cytoplasmic domain the binding of activated calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding site in the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain disrupts CEACAM1 dimers (25). this suggests that calcium-activated calmodulin binds to CEACAM1\u20134L in a manner that promotes its dissociation from the dimeric to the monomeric form. sequence of the human CEACAM1 transmembrane domain dimers is shown. position of two glycine residues (red text) is consistent with the GXXXG/tetrad motif repeat patterning (at position d) and with heptad repeat motif patterning (at positions d and a) (panel i) dimer exhibited a parallel, left-handed orientation consistent with packing via the small residue heptad motif. the small residues localized to the same surface of the transmembrane helix allowed close approach of the CEACAM1\u20134L TMDs in a parallel fashion. we replaced them with leucine, a large hydrophobic amino acid that maintained the hydrophobic character typical of most transmembrane domains. the mutated CEACAM1 expressed on the outer cell surface. this indicates that protein transport to and/or from the plasma membrane was not impaired by the transmembrane domain mutations. these results indicate that these glycine residues are essential for the oligomerization of CEACAM1. CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP-expressing cells showed a significantly higher anisotropy when treated with ionomycin (Fig. 6, A and B) this increase in anisotropy was similar to the difference observed in anisotropy between the monomeric and tandem-dimer Venus constructs. la cells expressing enhanced YFP-CEACAM1\u20134L and enhanced YFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L with and without ionomycin treatment. ionomycin treatment increases the anisotropy of CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP, indicating that there is an increase in the proportion of CEACAM1 that is monomeric. HeLa cells transfected with CEACAM1\u20134L, G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L (which are impaired in cis-dimerization), or R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L (which are impaired in cell-cell adhesion) no significant differences were detected when considering bacterial binding or internalization by cells expressing wild type versus the G432L/G436L mutant of CEACAM1\u20134 43S/Q44L mutations or CEACAM1\u20134L containing G432L/G436L mutations were infected with N. gonorrhoeae expressing either no Opa proteins (gray bars) or a CEACAM1-specific OpaCEA protein (black bars) the results are representative of three independent experiments. expression of transmembrane domain mutant G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L caused a substantial increase in cellular aggregation. results suggest that CEACAM1\u20134L mediates intercellular adhesion through homophilic interactions involving cis-monomeric CEACAM1 binding to cis-monomeric CEACAM1. the cells were lysed with nonionic detergent-containing buffers. CEACAM1 was immunoprecipitated using a CEACAM1-specific antibody. association of recovered proteins was then detected using immunoblot analysis. cells expressing pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were pretreated with pervanadate to preserve phosphotyrosines. cells expressing pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were immunostained with anti-CEACAM1 and effector-specific antibodies. CEACAM1 exists as a monomer and dimer in rat hepatocytes. but dimers could not be detected in CHO cells stably transfected with CEACAM1 (25) this effect was not the simple result of CEACAM1 overexpression in a transfected cell line. total cell lysates resolved under nonreducing (panel i) or reducing (panel ii) conditions by SDS-PAGE. immunoblots probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1. cells were transfected with only pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L (Y) or pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L-c-Myc (Y+M) and treated with DSP. 4L-myc consist of CEACAM1\u20134L with C-terminal YFP and Myc tags were co-transfected into HeLa cells. immunoprecipitation led to the recovery of pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L. treatment of cells with a Ca2+ ionophore alters levels of CEACAM1 dimerization in rat hepatocytes. ionomycin inhibited the dissociation of dimeric CEACAM1\u20134L. the ionomycin treatment has no effect on total CEACAM1 levels. ionomycin causes a calmodulin-dependent disruption of these dimers. the effect of ionomycin depended upon its ability to permit calcium flux into the cell. we tested the effect of the Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA on ionomycin-dependent dissolution of CEACAM1 dimers. the results cannot distinguish between cis- (parallel) and trans- (anti-parallel) interactions. flow cytometry studies with HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cannot distinguish between monomeric or dimeric states of the CEACAM1 at the cell surface. surface proteins were labeled by exposing HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cells to membrane-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin along with the DSP cross-linker and then isolating the biotinylated surface protein with streptavidin-agarose. surface dimers were apparent under both conditions. ionomycin and W-7-treated samples were either untreated or treated with ionomycin or W-7, and then proteins were cross-linked with DSP. calmodulin-associated proteins were resolved under nonreducing conditions. immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1 (panel i) or separated under reducing conditions. cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 is believed to directly participate in control of CEACAM1 dimerization. truncated form of CEACAM1 completely lacks the cytoplasmic domain. there was a decrease in the level of CEACAM1\u20134S dimers. treatment of HeLa cells expressing truncated CEACAM1 with ionomycin. truncated calmodulin binds to CEACAM1\u20134L in a manner that promotes its dissociation from the dimeric to the monomeric form. a CEACAM1 allele containing an R43S/Q44L mutation in the extracellular domain of CEACAM1 does not affect the cis-homophilic interactions of CEACAM1. a representative left-handed TMD dimer model is shown. individual helices are represented as gray ribbons. the glycine residues at the interface are depicted as space-filling spheres in shades of blue. transiently transfected HeLa cells with CEACAM1\u20134L or G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were evaluated for their ability to form dimers based on cross-linking. mutations introduced into the transmembrane domain of the receptors have been shown to cause misfolding or inappropriate membrane expression. CAM1\u20134L (A) or CEACAM1\u20134L containing G432L/G436L mutations were treated with various concentrations of the homobifunctional chemical cross-linker DSP. total cell lysates were resolved under nonreducing conditions (panel i) or reducing conditions (panel ii) by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1. this increase in anisotropy was similar to the difference observed in anisotropy between the monomeric and tandem-dimer Venus constructs. ionomycin treatment increases the anisotropy of CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP, indicating there is an increase in the proportion of CEACAM1 that is in monomeric form. 432L/G436L mutant reflect that seen with ionomycin-treated CEACAM1-4L-YFP. the data represent the mean S.E. from measurements on 30 or more cells collected from six independent experiments. aCEA-expressing gonococci cells were infected with HeLa cells expressing R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L compared with CEACAM1\u20134L. no significant differences were detected when considering bacterial binding or internalization by cells expressing wild type. the results are representative of three independent experiments. CEACAM1 trans-Homophilic Interactions Are Mediated by cis-Monomers of CEACAM1 CEACAM1 is capable of binding to itself in a trans-homophilic manner. the residues Arg-43 and Gln-44 at the N-terminal domain of the CEACAM1 are critical in cell-cell adhesion. the residues c-Src and c-Src were all associated with CEACAM1\u20134L monomers but not with CEACAM1\u20134L dimers. co-immunoprecipitation of downstream effectors with monomeric CEACAM1 suggests that the mode of molecular signaling may be attributed to a structural organization of the CEACAM1. the ratio of CEACAM1 dimers and monomers expressed on the cell surface has implications for the effect of CEACAM1. YFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L (green false-color YFP) with SHP-1 (red), with SHP-2 (red), or with c-Src (red) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Arrows indicate an area devoid of CEACAM1 bars, 10 m. HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L were used for cross-linking analysis. treatment resulted in an increasing intensity of 260 kDa. the human ectocervical and vaginal epithelial cells, which naturally express CEACAM1, were exposed to DSP. cells were transfected with only pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L (Y) or pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L and CEACAM1\u20134L-c-Myc (Y+M) and treated with DSP. cell lysates were probed with anti-CEACAM1 antibody to ensure all cells were expressing the transfected proteins. ionophore alters levels of CEACAM1\u20134L dimerization in rat hepatocytes. a decrease in the levels of CEACAM1\u20134L dimers was readily apparent. previous studies have demonstrated specific binding of calmodulin to the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1\u20134L. CEACAM1\u20134L dimers are formed by cis-interactions and regulated by intracellular Ca2+. transfected HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L (A\u2013C) or CEACAM1\u20134L were either untreated or treated with ionomycin or W-7 or W-7 and ionomycin or PBS + ionomycin, EGTA, and EGTA + ionomycin for various time points. oligomers that can be associated by Ca2+-calmodulin cannot distinguish between cis- (parallel) and trans- (anti-parallel) interactions. we took advantage of a mutant allele containing Arg-Gln to Ser-Leu mutations at positions 43 and 44 (R43S/Q44L) to confirm that dimeric CEACAM1 detected in our assays was in the cis-conformation (Fig. 2D, No treatment) flow cytometry studies with HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cannot distinguish between monomeric or dimeric states of the CEACAM1 at the cell surface. surface proteins were labeled by exposing HeLa-CEACAM1\u20134L cells to membrane-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin along with the DSP cross-linker. ionomycin treatment caused a rapid decrease in CEACAM1 dimers at the cell surface. cells expressing full-length CEACAM1 (CEACAM1\u20134L) were either untreated or treated with ionomycin or W-7, and then proteins were cross-linked with DSP. immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1 or separated under reducing conditions. studies have shown that calmodulin binds to the cytoplasmic domains of both CEACAM1\u20134L and the naturally occurring splice variant CEACAM1\u20134S (27, 51) in rat hepatocyte studies, the levels of CEACAM1 dimers decrease with the addition of activated calmodulin (25) changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, which could activate calmodulin, also affect the levels of CEACAM1 monomers and dimers cross-linked lysates were treated with a reducing agent to ensure equal expression of total CEACAM1-S. the sustained level of CEACAM1 dimers upon ionophore or calmodulin antagonist treatment verifies that the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal 10 amino acids are required for the calmodulin-dependent disruption of cell surface dimers. the extracellular domain of CEACAM1\u20134L that abrogates trans-homophilic binding does not affect the cis-homophilic interactions of CEACAM1. the transmembrane domain contains two glycines that are separated by three intervening residues. two established dimerization motifs in transmembrane -helices are consistent with the patterning of these glycine residues. computational modeling of a CEACAM1\u20134L TMD dimer was accomplished using the crystallography and NMR system-searching (CNS) of helix interactions (CHI) software suite (33, 34, 60) to examine whether any of the resulting structures were compatible with CEACAM1 self-association with this motif. this dimer exhibited a parallel, left-handed orientation consistent with packing via the small residue heptad motif. we analyzed CEACAM1 surface expression by flow cytometry using the mouse monoclonal antibody. mutated CEACAM1\u20134L and G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L mutants showed similar levels of surface and (after permeabilization of the cell membrane) total CEACAM1 expression. ele. data represent the mean S.E. from three separate experiments. FAIM was performed on cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP or G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP. 32L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L anisotropy suggests that this mutant exists exclusively as a monomer. these data indicate that CEACAM1 tends to exist in dimeric form on the plasma membrane of living cells due to the GXXXG transmembrane domain motif and becomes more monomeric upon association with calcium-loaded calmodulin. the human pathogenic bacteria N. gonorrhoeae express Opa protein adhesins that bind CEACAM1 and trigger effective bacterial engulfment into these otherwise nonphagocytic epithelial cells. no significant differences were detected when considering bacterial binding or internalization by cells expressing wild type versus the G432L. the bacterial adhesin does not have a preference for monomeric versus dimeric CEACAM1. this suggests that the preferred monomeric receptor form is not in limiting abundance on the cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L. cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L proceeded to aggregate following resuspension into single cells. 30% of cells in aggregates of 10 or more and 49% of cells in aggregates of 6 or more by 60 min. results suggest that CEACAM1\u20134L mediates intercellular adhesion through homophilic interactions involving cis-monomeric CEACAM1 binding. untransfected or transfected HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1\u20134L or G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were subjected to DSP and pervanadate treatment. the cells were lysed with nonionic detergent-containing buffers, and CEACAM1 was immunoprecipitated using a CEACAM1-specific antibody. CEACAM1 and associated proteins were co-immunoprecipitated (IP) with CEACAM1-specific antibodies. proteins were resolved under nonreducing conditions. immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for SHP-1, SHP-2, and c-Src. CEACAM1\u20134L mutants were immunostained with pervanadate to preserve phosphotyrosines. cell-cell contact areas displayed an intense co-localization of SHP-1, SHP-2, and c-Src associated with both the CEACAM1\u20134L and G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L cell lines. the human ectocervical (Ect1/E6E7) and vaginal (Vk2/E6E7) epithelial cells, which naturally express CEACAM1, were exposed to DSP. in both cell lines, a CEACAM1 complex with a mobility reflecting that seen in the transfected HeLa cells was apparent. co-immunoprecipitation assays with two different epitope-tagged CEACAM1\u20134L constructs. pEYFP-CEACAM1\u20134L and CEACAM1\u20134L-myc consist of CEACAM1\u20134L with YFP and Myc tags were co-transfected into HeLa cells. the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1\u20134L inhibits its self-association in rat hepatocyte (27, 51, 52) the cells were treated with calmodulin antagonist, W-7. to confirm the effect of ionomycin was dependent upon calmodulin, the cells were incubated with W-7 and then exposed to ionomycin. ionomycin causes a calmodulin-dependent disruption of these dimers. ionomycin was used at 10 m for B but used at 1 m for all other experiments. immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific for CEACAM1. ionomycin had little effect on the ratio of monomer to dimer within the cell. expressing CEACAM1\u20134L, treatment of HeLa cells expressing R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L resulted in a decrease in cis-dimers, although W-7 treatment had no effect. these results confirm that CEACAM1\u20134L dimers are formed by cis-interactions and also suggest that inactivity of calmodulin allows the coalescence of CEACAM1 into basal state cis-dimers. ionomycin treatment caused a rapid decrease in CEACAM1 dimers at the cell surface. surface dimers were apparent under both of these conditions. ionomycin and W-7 did not affect surface CEACAM1 uptake or degradation. transfected HeLa cells expressing a natural splice variant of CEACAM1 containing a short cytoplasmic domain, 10 amino acids (CEACAM1\u20134S) (B) or a recombinant form completely lacking a cytoplasmic domain (truncated CEACAM1) (C) were either untreated or treated with ionomycin or W-7, and then proteins were cross-linked with DSP. peptides synthesized to reflect the 10 most membrane-proximal amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 (55) we expressed a recombinant (non-natural) truncated form of CEACAM1 that completely lacks the cytoplasmic domain. we also expressed a recombinant (non-natural) truncated form of CEACAM1 that completely lacks the cytoplasmic domain. the binding of activated calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding site located in the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain disrupts CEACAM1 dimers (25). a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed a physical association between calmodulin and the CEACAM1 monomer but not with the CEACAM1 dimeric form. this suggests that calcium-activated calmodulin binds to CEACAM1\u20134L in a manner sequence of the human CEACAM1 transmembrane domain dimers is shown. position of two glycine residues (red text) is consistent with the GXXXG/tetrad motif repeat patterning (at position d) and with heptad repeat motif patterning (at positions d and a) (panel i) glycine residues localized to the same surface of the transmembrane helix allowed close approach of the CEACAM1\u20134L TMDs in a parallel fashion. we replaced them with leucine, a large hydrophobic amino acid that maintained the hydrophobic character typical of most transmembrane domains. the mutant failed to form dimers even in the presence of the highest concentration of DSP. the mutated CEACAM1 expressed on the outer cell surface. this indicates that protein transport to and/or from the plasma membrane was not impaired by the transmembrane domain mutations. these glycine residues are essential for the oligomerization of CEACAM1. this technique detects fluorescence depolarization due to energy transfer between identical fluorophores (homo-FRET) the various YFP-tagged CEACAM1\u20134L variants were indistinguishable based on intensity alone, showing fluorescence consistent with plasma membrane association. same cells showed significantly different anisotropies (Fig. 6A, Anisotropy) enhanced YFP-CEACAM1\u20134L and enhanced YFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L with and without ionomycin treatment. intensity images show similar expression and distribution of wild type and mutant CEACAM1 on the plasma membrane. ionomycin treatment increases anisotropy of CEACAM1\u20134L-YFP. HeLa cells transfected with CEACAM1\u20134L, G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L (which are impaired in cis-dimerization), or R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1\u20134L (which are impaired in cell-cell adhesion) no significant differences were detected when considering bacterial binding or internalization by cells expressing wild type versus the G432L/G436L mutant of CEACAM1\u20134 CEACAM1\u20134L containing G432L/G436L mutations were infected with N. gonorrhoeae expressing either no Opa proteins (gray bars) or a CEACAM1-specific OpaCEA protein (black bars) the results are representative of three independent experiments. expression of transmembrane domain mutant G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L caused significant increase in cellular aggregation. results suggest that CEACAM1\u20134L mediates intercellular adhesion through homophilic interactions involving cis-monomeric CEACAM1 binding to cis-monomeric CEACAM1. the cells were lysed with nonionic detergent-containing buffers. CEACAM1 was immunoprecipitated using a CEACAM1-specific antibody. association of recovered proteins was then detected using immunoblot analysis. cells expressing pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were pretreated with pervanadate to preserve phosphotyrosines. cells expressing pEYFP-G432L/G436L-CEACAM1\u20134L were immunostained with anti-CEACAM1 antibody to ensure the cells were expressing the transfected proteins under nonreducing or reducing conditions (panel i) CEACAM1 exists as either monomers or cis-homodimers on the surface of human epithelial cells. this is indicative of CEACAM1 dimerization being controlled by a cell type-specific process. this could reflect the efficiency of cross-linking at the DSP concentrations. ionomycin-induced calcium fluxes dissociate dimers of both CEACAM1\u20134L and CEACAM1\u20134S. this effect requires active calmodulin because the calmodulin-specific inhibitor W-7 completely abrogates the dissolution of CEACAM1 dimers. diverse motifs that may promote association between transmembrane helices have been identified. rat CEACAM1\u20134S encodes two different GXXXG sequences that must be simultaneously mutated to prevent the formation of dimers in rat hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. rat CEACAM1\u20134S encodes two different GXXXG sequences that must be simultaneously mutated to prevent the formation of dimers in their system. monomeric tyrosine kinases and SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases each appear to associate exclusively with the monomeric form of CEACAM1. rceaCAM1\u20134S-driven anchorage-independent growth has yet to be defined. rceaCAM1\u20134S/rat hepatocellular carcinoma study (28) basal state dimers on cell surface would be silent, and monomeric CEACAM1 at cell-cell junctions would liberate growth inhibitory signals. the increased CEACAM1-dependent cell aggregation kinetics and increased size of aggregates formed by the G432L/G436L mutant clearly suggest that monomeric CEACAM1 facilitates intercellular binding."}
