{"summary": "disease resistance has been associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype, as well as polymorphisms in several immune genes such as TGF and TNF[1,2]. innate immunity plays a major role with the macrophage being a key player in this enhanced immune response. IFN is a potent activator of macrophages and increased production has been associated with disease resistance in multiple species [27\u201331] chickens with enhanced IFN production are more resistant to certain infections. a2B expression is induced by IFN and leads to increase of anti-inflammatory signaling counteracting the inflammatory response activated within the IFN pathway. these studies emphasize the genetic basis of the activation of macrophages by IFN playing an important role in the innate immune response signaling. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using differential centrifugation. samples were centrifuged for 35 min (400 x g; 23\u00b0C; brake off) PBMCs were re-suspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 x 107 cells/ml. adherent cells were cultured for 6 days to allow maturation and differentiation of cells. -3 day (t-3) samples were lysed with 400 l Trizol. morphology of adherent cells was observed daily under bright field microscopy (20x objective) two birds from each haplotype were selected for inclusion in the sequencing. each bird provided blood for extraction and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. cell samples were collected from nine time points for each bird. sequencing reads ranged from a low of approximately 78 million reads to a high of just over 171 million reads each. most time points producing over 88.4 million reads each and a few producing over 100 million reads each. the chicken reference genome WASHUC2, corresponding to Ensembl release 70, was downloaded from Ensembl.org (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). sequences were filtered to remove low quality sequences from the data. aligned reads generated by Bowtie produced gapped alignments on the reference genome. resulting aligned reads were analyzed to construct transcripts corresponding to mRNA sequences. gene enrichment calculations were performed using the DAVID bioinformatics database tool version 6.8. the analysis was performed using comparisons of successive time points within the B2 haplotype data to identify sets of genes that were enriched. highlights were selected to provide examples of the biological process annotations, KEGG pathways annotations and reactome pathways. primer sequences previously published were used for TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR7 [45]. ATP6VOC (annealing 60\u00b0C) forward TGTTGTCATGGCGGGTATTA, reverse ACAAATAACCTGGGCTGCTG; IL18R (annealing 63\u00b0C) forward ATCCTCACCCCTACCCTGTC, reverse GACGTGTCACGATCATCTGG; TLN-1 (annealing 63\u00b0 experimental animals Animal protocols were performed under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California (WesternU). experimental animals were euthanized by insufflation of isoflurane gas (Butler, Dublin,OH) PBMCs were re-suspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 x 107 cells/ml. macrophage cell culture 1 milliliter of PBMC suspension (5 x 107 cells/ml) was incubated for 3 h in each well of a 12-well plate containing RPMI w/o Phenol Red supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. IFN stimulation A 50 g/ml ch-IFN solution was prepared in RPMI w/o Phenol Red culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) macrophage cultures were stimulated with 1 ml of RPMI-ch-IFN mixture. RNA was processed with the Qiashredder and RNAeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) an RNA sequence library was constructed from purified RNA. the library was fragmented in order to generate appropriately sized RNA fragments suitable for templates in random primed cDNA synthesis. the samples corresponding to each time point from each bird were sequenced and the data was stored in a unique file. 1373 71211600 23314834 6597915 298903517 aligned reads 11471896 8872332 5508010 16979440 35666816 56923920 38573825 10060460 3421906 187478605 multiple alignments 148334 43889 21791 70270 131735 229889 141032 49269 16332 852541 BIRD-B (B2) reads 1459795 285369 aligned reads generated by Bowtie produced gapped alignments on the reference genome. resulting aligned reads were analyzed by Cufflinks to construct transcripts corresponding to mRNA sequences. transcriptome data was normalized using fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) method to more accurately determine expression levels. gene expression data was hierarchically clustered using 1-Pearson correlation on the rows and keeping the column order conserved. a subset of representative highlights from each of these three enrichment analyses was chosen for inclusion in the results. highlights were selected to provide examples of the biological process annotations, KEGG pathways annotations and reactome annotations. RNA was taken from macrophages stimulated with IFN as described above for 2 and 4 hours. 179 gene expression measurements were extracted from a paper describing the fold change in expression levels of genes induced after 4 h exposure to cytomegalovirus. the data was converted to a tab-delimited text file containing the official gene symbol and the reported expression level. in only the B2 chickens and 873 genes were expressed only in the B19 birds. the t-3 day time point exhibited the greatest expression of genes. only 4068 genes lacked evidence of expression in both haplotypes. 210 genes exhibiting differential expression at the t-6 day time point. these genes represent 198 genes with higher expression in the B2 birds. 7000 genes showed higher expression in the B19 birds. by 16 hours after stimulation, only 66 genes are differentially expressed between the two haplotype groups. at the 24 hour mark, 406 genes show evidence of statistically significant differences in expression between them. - 326 14 312 B19 t-3 versus B19 t0 7157 7144 13 B19 t0 versus B19 t2 180 159 21 B19 t2 versus B19 t4 1227 63 1164 B19 4 versus B19 8 70 20 50 B19 8 versus B19 16 386 362 24 B19 16 versus B19 24 24 11 13 Different temporal gene expression patterns in the B-locus. RNA was sampled on day t-6, day t-3, and again three days later. the most dramatic difference occurs on day t-6. TRIM7, TRIM27.1, BF2, TRIM41 exhibit strong expression. there are differences in the selection of high affinity peptides in B19 vs B15 haplotypes [49] highlighting their critical role in immune competence. additional genes within the B-locus display a similar pattern of pre-stimulatory differences in gene expression between the two different haplotypes, including genes involved in differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis. four distinct patterns of divergent gene expression were identified between the B2 haplotype birds and the B19 haplotype birds. this divergent pattern exhibits strong expression of genes on day -6 in the B2 haplotype cells. there is a four-hour difference in peak expression timing for a large number of induced genes. in the B2 haplotype macrophages, peak expression occurs between 2 and 4 hours. in the B19 macrophages, peak expression occurs between 4 and 8 hours. divergent expression patterns are the single peak of day t-6 expression in the B2 haplotype cells compared to the prolonged multiple day expression in the B19 haplotype cells. some of these genes are macrophage differentiation mediators, like GATA2 [50], and FADD. others are macrophage podosome (primary matrix structure) markers, including VCL and GSN. the B19 cells exhibit a dispersed \u201csmear\u201d of gene expression extending from approximately 1 hour after stimulation to 16 hours post-stimulation. some of the most represented genes exhibiting this divergent pattern of expression include molecules involved in lysosome function and phagocytosis. CTTN and ACTR3 genes implicated in FcR mediated phagocytosis. expression was measured in separate samples of B2 and B19 haplotype cells. expression was measured at 0 hours, 2 hours and 4 hours post stimulation. ATP6V0C showed the greatest induction of all genes assayed. expression of ATP6VOC was dramatically less in the B19 birds. ovirus stimulation was used as comparisons for the corresponding genes in the B2 and b19 haplotype birds. a total of 25 published genes exhibited decreases in expression following cytomegalovirus stimulation. all but one gene (FEZ1) in the B2 cells exhibited increased expression following stimulation. twenty-eight genes (52%) expressed in the B2 cells matched the direction of the fold change reported in the published data. 33 genes (61%) corresponded between the B19 cells and the published data. miRNAs contained in clade3 and clade4 exhibit greater expression in B19 cells. small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) exhibit similarly dichotomous gene expression patterns (clade4). clade1 contains IL6, IL18, IL-1, CCL1, PTPN2 and MMP10. clade5 contains the single gene IFN, which exhibits relatively low expression early in both B2 and B19 cells. following stimulation rises to a higher level at 8 hours in the B19 birds. further results including divergent non-coding RNA expression will be described in more detail in further publications. t-6 vs. B2 t-3 Down

B19 macrophages are able to rapidly turn on and reach relatively high levels of expression within 2 to 4 hours of IFN stimulation. these same genes fail to exhibit a coherent peak of expression, even after 4 to 8 hours, in the B19 cells. the most represented genes exhibiting this divergent pattern of expression include molecules involved in lysosome function and phagocytosis. 356 of these genes exhibit decreased expression during this same time interval. expression was measured in separate samples of B2 and B19 haplotype cells following stimulation with IFN. change in expression was assessed at 2 hours and 4 hours post stimulation. IFN stimulated vs. cytomegalovirus stimulated macrophage gene expression. 54 genes, for which gene expression changes were previously described following cytomegalovirus stimulation, were used as comparisons for the corresponding genes in the B2 and b19 haplotype birds. all but one gene (FEZ1) in the B19 cells showed increased expression. seven exhibited decreased expression in the cytomegalovirus stimulated cells. twenty-eight genes (52%) expressed in the B19 cells matched the direction of the fold change reported in the published data. genes cluster into four major clades (clade1, clade2, clade3, and clade4) with a singleton gene. miRNAs contained in clade3 and clade4 exhibit greater expression in B19 cells (mir-1627, mir-222b, mir-1633, and mir-19a) clade1 contains IL6, IL18, IL-1, CCL1, PTPN2 and MMP10. the protein-coding genes LAMP2, UBXN7, UBE4B, PK3CA, UBE2W, and CX3CR1 exhibit higher initial expression patterns in the B19 birds. tylation 20 4.18E-04 B2 t-6

processing and negative regulation mediated gene expression. KEGG pathways that exhibit enrichment for these genes include RNA transport, protein export, lysosome, mRNA surveillance pathway, endocytosis and mTOR signaling. enriched reactome pathways mirror these processes and include cytosolic sensors of pathogen-associated DNA, RNA polymerase II initiation and promoter clearance, mTORC1-mediated signaling, MAP2K and MAPK activation. previous work in our laboratories investigated the association between chicken haplotype and disease resistance. we showed that macrophages play an important role in this enhanced immunity, leading to decreased clinical signs of illness. we stimulated macrophages from B2 and B19 chicks for RNA sequencing. the results show that there are large numbers of genes differentially expressed in the two haplotypes, both during differentiation of monocytes into mature macrophages. the answer to the question of why the IFN stimulated B2 haplotype cells produce more nitric oxide than the IFN stimulated B19 cells. a large number of genes is highly expressed in both haplotypes at day t-6 versus day t-3 in the two haplotypes. this seems to indicate a lack of appropriate regulation in the B19 birds. some of the genes showing this pattern are macrophage differentiation associated GATA2 and FADD. macrophage differentiation, M1 and M2 macrophage markers, lysosomal factors involved in phagocytosis, podosome development, invadosome capabilities, chemotaxis potential and matrix degradation ability. RT-PCR on a set of differentially expressed genes between the B2 and B19 macrophages provides independent evidence that the pattern of gene expression observed at each time point was consistent and reproducible. es have a significant impact on the subsequent ability for stimulation of immune genes after IFN treatment. the differences in gene expression correlate with the previously observed differences in morphology of the two haplotypes. it seems likely that a variety of genomic regulatory mechanisms might play a major role in this process. the file contains a total of 163,043 rows including the header line containing field names. note \u2018AB\u2019 corresponds to B2 haplotype and \u2018EC\u2019 corresponds to B19 haplotype. gene set\u2014indicates the specific set of differentially expressed genes, \u2018Down\u2019 or \u2018Up\u2019; Category\u2014indicates the specific subset of terms that were used for the analysis.
