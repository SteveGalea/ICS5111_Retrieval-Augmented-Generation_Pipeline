{"summary": "multiplex PCR and microarray systems offer new insights into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of respiratory disease (8,9). a laboratory diagnosis is not routinely achieved for a substantial portion of respiratory specimens from symptomatic patients. independent amplification and sequence analysis of VP4/2 coding sequence (8) in both laboratories showed sequences that matched the novel genotype in 4 (29%) samples obtained from patients with LRTIs and respiratory distress. samples collected in C\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire, west africa, were from symptomatic persons living in the vicinity of Ta National Park. sequences belonging to novel genotype identified in new york state (NY-003, \u2013028, \u2013041, \u2013042, \u2013060, and \u2013074 [8]) included for reference are sequences belonging to the novel genotype identified in new york state (NY-003, \u2013028, \u2013041, \u2013042, \u2013060, and \u2013074 [8]. outbreak samples were collected in the summer months from camps of >100,000 refugees from Bhutan located in Jhapa, southeast Nepal. samples represented all age groups and were collected from December 2005 through July 2006. independent molecular typing in both laboratories indicated the novel genotype in 3 (6%) samples. TMRCA was estimated at 1,800 y, although with wide variance caused by the short sequence available (95% HPD = 279\u20135,201 y) diversity observed within the novel clade and its genetic distance from other HRV/HEV were comparable to those seen for HRV-A, -B, or the HEV species. our findings indicate the need for further investigation into this third (HRV-C) rhinoviruses."}
