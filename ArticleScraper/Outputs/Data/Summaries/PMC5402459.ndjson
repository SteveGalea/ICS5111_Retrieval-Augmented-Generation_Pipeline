{"summary": "clathrin adaptor epsin1 N-terminal homology domain drives membrane curvature (21) and fission (42). mutation of a leucine residue in the hydrophobic face of the helix to a hydrophilic glutamic acid (L6E ENTH) resulted in dramatically reduced membrane curvature (21) and fission (42) to quantify membrane fission by ENTH. the unreleased membrane left on SUPER templates can be collected and summed with the released membrane to confirm that all membrane is recovered after a fission experiment. wtENTH in the concentration range of 1\u201310 M or 10 M L6E ENTH was incubated with SUPER templates for 30 min. wtENTH in the concentration range of 1\u201310 M drove increasing membrane release. wtENTH did not drive appreciable membrane release at 10 M. wtENTH did not drive appreciable membrane release at 10 M. the helix of L6E ENTH may be less efficient at driving fission. in contrast, the binding affinity of L6E ENTH may be hindered compared with wtENTH. this second possibility is consistent with a protein crowding model. we measured the donor fluorescence lifetime as vesicles diffused through a laser volume in solution. to estimate membrane coverage, we fit measured lifetime decays to simulated decays corresponding to specified levels of membrane coverage. we simulated random configurations of proteins on the membrane surface over a range of coverage values. membrane coverage of wtENTH and L6E ENTH increased monotonically from 4 2% SD at 1 M to 50. SDs in each trial were calculated from three to six lifetime decays. membrane coverage by L6E ENTH increased at a more moderate rate, reaching a coverage of 23 3% SD at 100 M (Fig. 2C). vesicles exposed to 50 M L6E ENTH were similar in fluorescence lifetime to vesicles exposed to 2 M wtENTH. our procedure of fitting lifetime decays with simulated decays provided excellent fits over a range of membrane coverages. however, the accuracy of fitting began to deteriorate somewhat at higher coverage values (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B and C), likely owing to effects not captured by our simulation. measured brightness of individual fluorescently labeled proteins and vesicles of known average diameter. after 60 min, average membrane coverage reached 49% (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). wtENTH and L6E ENTH have similar fission efficiencies. fission efficiency is determined by membrane coverage by protein. membrane coverage is the primary determinant of fission efficiency, regardless of helix hydrophobicity. the hydrophilic helix mutation of L6E ENTH reduces membrane binding. a higher concentration of L6E ENTH is required to reach the same membrane coverage and fission efficiency as wtENTH. the super template membrane shedding assay quantifies relative fission efficiency. exposure of vesicles to 60 M L6E ENTH led to the formation of membrane tubes with a pearled morphology. small vesicles with average diameter 30 22 nm SD. curvature of fission vesicles is determined by membrane coverage by protein. vesicle diameter after exposure to 60 M wtENTH: 30 22 nm SD. vesicle diameter after exposure to 20 M wtENTH: 23 2 nm SD, calculated as the average of the trial medians. one trial is one instance of diluting vesicles, incubating with protein. one trial is one instance of diluting vesicles, incubating with protein. one trial is one instance of diluting vesicles, incubating with protein. fluorescently labeled vesicles were tethered to a coverslip and estimated vesicle brightness by fitting diffraction-limited puncta with 2D Gaussian profiles using particle detection software (54). vesicles were mixed with protein in solution and tethered to the substrate only after the fission process was complete. L6E ENTH at 50 M induced a moderate decrease in vesicle diameter. but increasing the concentration of L6E ENTH to 100 M resulted in highly curved fission vesicles of 22 nm diameter. this finding is consistent with previous reports of membrane remodeling by protein. the increase in vesicle number, 40-fold, was consistent with a decrease in surface area per fission product, also 40-fold, under the assumption that total membrane surface area is conserved in the fission process. the process of fission took longer for both wtENTH and L6E ENTH compared with 22 min for wtENTH from sigmoid fitting. crowded membrane-bound proteins generate substantial pressure at membrane surfaces. this expansive pressure bends the membrane and also stretches it, increasing membrane tension locally. lipid tubules exist as a series of rounded pearls connected by more constricted necks. membrane-bound proteins should drive fission in the absence of helix insertions. we first tested the prediction that larger proteins should drive fission more efficiently. steric bulk of full-length epsin1 effectively limits membrane coverage of helix insertions to less than 1% of the membrane surface. epsin1 FL occupies 50% of lattice sites. average diameters after exposure to 10 wtENTH and 10 epsin1 FL are 49 16 nm SD and 38 30 nm SD. vesicles for negative stain electron microscopy with his-epsin1 FL: 80 mol% DOPC and 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni, extruded to 200 nm. vesicles after 2 h of exposure to 20 M his-epsin1 FL: 31 19 nm SD. after exposure to 20 M hisENTH (orange: 1,307 vesicles from 43 fields of view, n = 3) or 20 M his-epsin1 FL (purple: 1,150 vesicles from 37 fields of view, n = 3). average diameters after exposure to 5 M and 20 M his-epsin1 FL are 91 31 nm SD and 49 28 nm SD, respectively. epsin1 FL generated highly curved fission products by using the tethered vesicle brightness assay. we mixed 200-nm diameter vesicles containing 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2 with 10 M epsin1 FL. the bulkier epsin1 FL generated a population of vesicles of small diameter centered near 20 nm, which was not present in the wt exposure to the higher concentration of 20 M hisENTH led to the appearance of two vesicle populations of distinct diameter. epsin1 FL formed fission vesicles of greater curvature than hisENTH at both 5 M and 20 M (36 1 nm SD and 18 2 nm SD) 100 fission products were produced from each 100-nm starting vesicle. we conclude that membrane-bound ENTH does not require insertion of an amphipathic helix to drive fission. we next probed the extent to which proteins other than epsin1 are capable of driving fission. Schematic of mixture experiment in which Sar1p and AP180 CTD were coincubated with vesicles. vesicles were fused to the C terminus of AP180 (residues 328\u2013896 of AP180) after 5 M Sar1p + 5 M AP180 CTD, 1,455 vesicles from 83 fields of view. average diameters after exposure to 10 M Sar1p, 5 M Sar1p-AP180 CTD and 5 M Sar1p + 5 M AP180 CTD: 61 11, 29 3, and 29 1 nm SD, respectively. chimera was fused to the C-terminal domain of AP180 (AP180 CTD), residues 328\u2013896 of AP180. chimera expected to occupy a membrane footprint of 90 nm2 on the membrane surface, based on previous measurements of the membrane footprint of AP180. the extent of membrane fission was significantly greater than it was for vesicles exposed to 10 M of hexa-histidine\u2013tagged AP180 CTD. vesicles containing DOGS-NTA-Ni were exposed to his-GFP at concentrations well above the dissociation constant of the histidine\u2013NTA interaction. super templates contain a low-tension reservoir of membrane surrounding a glass bead. they undergo membrane tubulation and fission upon exposure to curvature- and fission-inducing proteins. super templates contain a low-tension reservoir of membrane surrounding a glass bead. wtENTH in the concentration range of 1\u201310 M or 10 M L6E ENTH was incubated with SUPER templates for 30 min. vesicle release was measured as Texas Red signal present in the supernatant. 10\u2013250 M, we found that L6E ENTH drove increasing levels of membrane release with increasing concentration. the more moderately hydrophilic helix mutant L6Q ENTH drove membrane release at intermediate levels. the need for high solution concentrations of L6E ENTH to drive fission could be interpreted in two ways. fission defect of L6E ENTH is due to insufficient hydrophobicity of the insertion. if protein crowding is responsible for fission by ENTH, we would expect wtENTH and L6E ENTH to drive fission at similar levels as function of membrane coverage. new tab Reducing the hydrophobicity of the amphipathic helix of ENTH substantially reduces membrane binding. Vesicle composition is 80 mol% DOPC, 15 mol% DOPS, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2, and 0.1 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. vesicles exposed to 50 M L6E ENTH-Atto 594 indicate a similar degree of donor lifetime quenching as 2 M wtENTH. membrane coverage by wtENTH increased monotonically from 4 2% SD at 1 M to 50 10% SD at 20 M. vesicles exposed to 50 M L6E ENTH showed a clear decrease in fluorescence lifetime with increasing concentration of acceptor-labeled wtENTH. lifetime images showed that vesicles exposed to 50 M ENTH were similar in fluorescence lifetime to vesicles exposed to 2 M wtENTH. vesicles were labeled with Oregon Green 488 to quantify vesicle size. protein was labeled with Atto 594 to quantify the number of bound proteins. the ratio of lipid to protein dyes was increased 50-fold in comparison with lifetime-FRET studies. different solution concentrations of wtENTH and L6E ENTH were required to reach similar coverage on the membrane surface. dissociation constants are 10- to 100-fold greater than previous measurements under dilute conditions (55\u201357), as expected owing to the negative effect of protein crowding on membrane binding. Membrane release from SUPER templates measured at same wtENTH and L6E ENTH concentrations used for measuring membrane coverage in Fig. 2C. membrane coverage is the primary determinant of fission efficiency, regardless of helix hydrophobicity. wtENTH and L6E ENTH performed negative stain electron microscopy of vesicles before and after exposure to protein. exposure to 18 M wtENTH led to the formation of visible membrane tubules, many of which displayed a pearled morphology suggestive of high spontaneous curvature. vesicles before protein exposure, 559 vesicles measured from 23 fields of view. vesicle diameter after exposure to 18 M wtENTH: 23 15 nm SD. the color map corresponds to the pixel intensity ranges specified next to each plot. images show diffraction-limited puncta of fluorescent vesicles before exposure to protein (G), after 1-h exposure to 20 M wtENTH (H) and after 1-h exposure to 100 M L6E ENTH (I) each marker corresponds to one FCS trace and error bars represent SEM. vesicles were mixed with protein in solution and tethered to the substrate only after the fission process was complete. fluorescence brightness-based method for measuring the distributions of vesicle diameter provided greater statistical confidence than electron microscopy. exposure of vesicles with an average initial diameter of 200 nm (Fig. 4 G and J) to 20 M wtENTH resulted in a dramatic reduction in vesicle diameter to 21 nm (distribution mode) 100 M L6E ENTH reached a lower membrane coverage (Fig. 2C) and drove membrane shedding less efficiently than 20 M wtENTH. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) revealed a pronounced increase in the number of vesicles diffusing in solution following protein addition. electron microscopy, fluorescence vesicle brightness studies, and vesicle FCS conclude that both wtENTH and L6E ENTH are equally capable of driving the conversion of vesicles into highly curved fission products. the diameters of fission products measured from tethered vesicle brightness studies fell along a similar trend when plotted as a function of membrane coverage by protein. the proposed protein crowding mechanism for membrane fission makes at least two important predictions. proteins of larger physical size, which can reach a state of crowded coverage with fewer bound proteins compared with smaller proteins, should drive fission more efficiently. the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of epsin1 consists of 432 amino acids. steric pressure among IDPs can promote membrane curvature. we compared membrane release from SUPER templates by wtENTH and epsin1. epsin1 FL occupies 50% of lattice sites. vesicle diameters measured with tethered brightness assay, normalized to their respective maxima. violet: after exposure to 10 M epsin1 FL, 2,591 vesicles from 45 fields of view, n = 3. average diameters after exposure to 10 M wtENTH and 10 M epsin1 FL are 49 16 nm SD and 38 30 nm SD, respectively. histograms of vesicle diameters measured with tethered brightness assay. average diameters after exposure to 5 M and 20 M his-epsin1 FL are 91 31 nm SD and 49 28 nm SD, respectively. epsin1 FL drove membrane release with greater efficiency than wtENTH at all concentrations. epsin1 FL generated a population of vesicles of small diameter centered near 20 nm. epsin1 FL bound to membranes containing 20 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl] by a histidine\u2013NTA interaction. epsin1 FL generated highly curved fission products with an average diameter of 31 19 nm SD. his-epsin1 FL formed fission vesicles of greater curvature than wtENTH. exposing vesicles to 20 M his-epsin1 FL resulted in a single population of fission products of high curvature. the bulkier his-epsin1 FL was able to transform vesicles into the most highly curved state more efficiently than hisENTH. membrane fission via insertion of an amphipathic helix. vesicle diameter was reduced to 61 11 nm SD (Fig. 6 D and G) at 10 M, Sar1p reached a coverage of 10 2% SEM. diffraction-limited puncta of fluorescent vesicles after 2-h exposure to 10 M Sar1p (D), after 2-h exposure to 5 M Sar1p-AP180 CTD (E) and after 2-h exposure to 5 M Sar1p + 5 M AP180 CTD (F) vesicle diameters measured with tethered brightness assay. mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni, 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, 0.5 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE extruded to 200 nm. image contrasted the same as D\u2013F. boxed yellow region corresponds to pixel intensity profile on right. vesicles were exposed to either Sar1p-AP180 CTD or Sar1p at a solution concentration of 10 M. exposure of 200-nm extruded vesicles to 5 M Sar1p-AP180 CTD led to a more dramatic reduction in vesicle diameter than was seen with Sar1p at the higher concentration of 10 M. this enhanced fission ability of the chimera can likely be attributed to the improved ability of the chimera to progressive reduction in vesicle diameter to 100 41 nm and 22 5 nm SD. results demonstrate even proteins with no physiological role in fission are capable of driving the process when concentrated at the membrane surface. reducing the hydrophobicity of ENTH\u2019s amphipathic helix did not impact the efficiency of membrane vesiculation or the curvature of fission products. many proteins involved in membrane fission contain large IDP domains (73), including auxilin (76), intersectin (72), and amphiphysin (77). the physical bulk of these IDPs may increase steric pressure and spontaneous curvature locally at the membrane neck. an important role of dynamin may therefore be to mark the potential site of fission. early cells, with limited protein complexity, could have achieved membrane fission before the evolution of dedicated fission machines. the results provide a potential explanation for how early cells could have achieved membrane fission before the evolution of dedicated fission machines.
