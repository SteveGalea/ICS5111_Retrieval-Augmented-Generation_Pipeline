{"summary": "individual-based activity and behaviour study benefits disease transmission modelling. potential for using tracking technologies to capture detailed space-time trajectories and model individual behaviour is increasing rapidly. use of low-cost tracking devices in medical research has also been proved effective by more and more studies. new outbreaks of highly communicable diseases have triggered a marked rise in studies on infectious disease transmissions [16], with equal amount of attention on the mechanisms of global disease spread [3,8,17], and at the regional scale of within countries or cities. only limited research was reported at the micro scale, such as in the environment exemplified by a relatively closed campus. applications of these technologies started to flourish in transportation research [38], retail studies [35], human ecology [36], and more recently, health related studies [27,39-54]. a couple of studies have attempted to track exposures to health risk factors related to human movement [27,47], with one targeting infectious disease but the focus was on vector-borne disease only. indoor tracking technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and Wi-Fi-based positioning systems have only been used in modelling shopping behaviour in a specific grocery store. Assisted GPS is one kind of the so-called hybrid positioning systems. daily mobility-activity information obtained from GPS tracking can be used as an indicator to measure exposures to risk factors of infection. visualization and exploratory analysis of movement data include the use of static maps, animated maps, ringmaps and space-time cubes. student A and C sat in the same classroom for a class period (co-existence in terms of a static bundle) but met again later and walked along (co-existence in terms of a dynamic bundle) the fact that C (and A) used the same classroom after B left from an earlier class makes it a situation called co-location. a few researchers have tackled the visual clutter problem with different approaches. high density indicates more overlapping of individuals\u2019 activity spaces. high density indicates more overlapping of individuals\u2019 activity spaces. studies of infectious disease transmissions have triggered a marked rise in the number of studies on infectious disease transmissions [16], with equal amount of attention on the mechanisms of global disease spread. only limited research, however, was reported at the micro scale, such as in the environment exemplified by a relatively closed campus, small community, school, residential, or hospital buildings. applications of these technologies started to flourish in transportation research [38], retail studies [35], human ecology [36], and more recently, health related studies [27,39-54]. a couple of studies have attempted to track exposures to health risk factors related to human movement [27,47], with one targeting infectious disease but the focus was on vector-borne disease only. indoor tracking technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and Wi-Fi-based positioning systems have only been used in modelling shopping behaviour in a specific grocery store.

period (co-existence in terms of a static bundle) but met again later and walked along (co-existence in terms of a dynamic bundle) both dynamic bundles and static bundles are highly relevant, whereas point bundles and co-location beyond the lifespan of an airborne virus can be less important. large data volumes may result in apparent visual clutters. high density indicates more overlapping of

low signal areas. it does not store data in the device but transmits constantly the time and location information to a central storage server. participants do not need to perform any complicated operation except for charging it every night. ries except flu status, gender and ethnical information. pre-processing is the cleaning of noisy raw trajectory data. previous research has addressed the problem with various filtering algorithms. automatic pre-processing algorithm searches through loaded trajectory data. algorithm starts from selecting segments with high roughness and then expands back and forth. a spatial roughness indicator is used to reveal the spiky shapes. the assumption was that individuals\u2019 habitual behaviour in their activity space tends to repeat over time. tracking data sometime within the flu season could reveal useful information and patterns that are relevant to flu infections that happen in the season. this assumption is supported by recent research that models human mobility patterns. a connection analysis may help identify popular connections among campus buildings and infer typical activity sequences on campus. the main tracking device used in this study is a commercial child tracker device, WorldTracker GPRS. it uses the siRF Star III GPS Chipset with high sensitivity to enhance performance in low signal areas. a total of 100 participants were recruited to carry the device during their daily activities for a week. 96 of them generated over 400 valid day-trajectories. a three-day experiment in our study generated 30 trajectories paired with diary records. visual examination of the trajectory data collected in our study reveals distinct patterns of errors resulting mostly from indoor stays. such errors may be easily identified by overlaying the trajectory data with a detailed building layer and manually removed by selecting the erroneous track points. large volume of data, however, prohibits manual processing. spiky segments are then targeted to calculate their spatiotemporal centroids using a time-weighted cluster centroid approach. points that represent segments with longer durations are assigned higher importance. spatial topology with regard to buildings is also used to label segments to corresponding categories. visual exploratory methods were applied to detect patterns. the density of different activities at different campus locations is visualized. the density of different activities at different locations is visualized. a connection is a link represented by one or multiple segments in the collected trajectory data indicating a student has travelled from one building to another. a connection analysis may help identify popular connections among campus buildings and infer typical activity sequences on campus. hotspots such as those buildings with the most outbound or inbound traffic and hubs that connect the most trafficked places by a certain group of students may also be identified. three trajectories were collected with an iPhone, a Garmin GPS, and an A-GPS based child tracker. each device has the shortest battery life when set to actively record and save locations. a three-day experiment was conducted with ten students to collect trajectories. ten of the 30 trajectory-diary pairs were excluded from our analysis. a total number of 55 indoor stays on campus with a total length of 63.15 hours were recorded. the pre-processed and segmented A-GPS trajectories captured 57 indoor stays with a total length of 65.40 hours. all three commonly used GPS or A-GPS devices perform comparable in obtaining detailed trajectory data for space time activity studies. handheld GPS supports the most temporal details but needs intervention for long durations of data collection. new generations of the smart phone and better apps could improve significantly on this aspect. the UC (A) appears to be a hotspot from morning (Figure 6a) to late afternoon (Figure 6d) but slightly cools down toward the evening (Figure 6e). the departmental building cluster indicated by label C seems to be crowded throughout the day but especially so in late afternoon and evening. the university class schedule indicates that classes scheduled in this time are often double periods-taking as long as 2 hour 45 minutes. the method has the potential to reveal hidden space-time activity patterns that may give insights to flu transmission at the micro-scale. our segmentation algorithm has limitations when it comes to labelling segments with buildings especially when the buildings are close together or connected. it is also speculated that these buildings have classrooms where students may spend hours indoors taking classes without having to go outside of a building. new ventilation and the fact that student activity has to often involve outdoor time periods whenever taking other classes out of the building could lead to lower risks. pre-processed trajectory and Figure 3c displays the segmented trajectory with color-coded indoor and outdoor segments in the space-time cube. the horizontal dimensions represent space and the vertical dimension is time. straight segments should represent stays over a period of time. a three-day experiment was conducted with ten students to collect trajectories paired with diary records. ten were excluded from our analysis as they either contain incomplete diary records. a total number of 55 indoor stays on campus with a total length of 63.15 hours were recorded. the segmentation algorithm we used sometimes mislabelled an indoor segment in a wrong building, especially when two buildings are connected to each other. the time that students spent in their dorm buildings is such an attribute. the dorm time recorded in the diary data totalled to be 10.70. a few sidewalks are the most heavily travelled by the participants. Figure 5c shows the 3D density surface of space-time activities on campus. activity patterns vary and hotspots may change throughout the day. the departmental building cluster is home to three departments in the college of natural sciences that lie very close to each other and are connected by indoor pathways. some preliminary speculation on the cause of this pattern include that on one side, the science students who take classes in these buildings tend to stay indoors for a long period of time. the UC is the most heavily trafficked stop on campus. it was hypothesized as a potential high risk hub during flu season. the departmental buildings involved in the second connection are all attached to each other with indoor pathways. current tracking technology proved to be able to collect data accurate enough for space-time activity study in the micro-scale. compared to traditional activity dairy and questionnaire techniques, employment of GPS based devices, such as the A-GPS we experimented in this study. privacy has long been a major concern in both medical research and geospatial studies that involve tracking of individuals. such high accuracy leads to more serious privacy concerns that may be another barrier for their uses. the first outbreak of H1N1 flu infections in the u.s. or a hospital ward that had many doctor infections in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the u.s."}
