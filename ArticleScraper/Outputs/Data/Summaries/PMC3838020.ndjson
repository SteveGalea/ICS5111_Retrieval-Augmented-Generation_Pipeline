{"summary": "traditional diagnostic methods such as viral culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing have been replaced by rapid antigen testing (RAT) and molecular methods. the low sensitivity and specificity of RATs is well described, but their short turnaround time (TAT) and ease of use make them an appealing option (1, 2). Molecular methods offer superior sensitivity and specificity but can have extended turnaround times (3, 4) the Popowitch et al. study (7) to be 57.1%. the findings are consistent with other reports that have also shown low adenovirus sensitivity for the FilmArray assay (8, 9). specimens included in retrospective validation period were positive for adenovirus by either direct fluorescent antibody staining (Diagnostics Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH) or by Luminex xTAG RVP PCR. all testing was performed according to manufacturer's recommendations. the assay was run as a four-step protocol: step 1, 97\u00b0C for 120 s; step 2, 97\u00b0C for 10 s; step 3, 60\u00b0C for 30 s; and step 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 40 times. the performance of both assays was internally validated. the sensitivity and specificity of both assays were 100%. each serotype was serially 10-fold diluted until assay results were negative (11). Sensitivity in the retrospective study was calculated as the number of FilmArray positive results divided by the total number of positive specimens by the LDT. prospective analysis was performed during two periods. the first period (27 November 2013 to 5 April 2013) included 598 consecutive specimens. the second period (6 April 2013 to 10 April 2013) included 115 consecutive specimens. quantitative adenovirus assays were internally validated against results provided by a major reference laboratory in the united states. the limit of detection for both assays was 125 copies/ml. the lower limit of reliable quantitation was 1,000 copies/ml. sensitivity for adenovirus was determined to be 66.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.80) for all specimens and 57.9% among mixed specimens. sensitivity for adenovirus was determined to be 66.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.80) for all specimens and 100% among mixed specimens. performance for the detection of influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, Bordetella pertussis, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus were unchanged (data not shown). 1.6 and 1.7 adenovirus sensitivities FilmArray version Retrospective Prospective No. positive No. (%) detected by FilmArray (sensitivity) (P = 0.04) Total no, tested No. positive No. (%) detected by filmArray v1.6 and v1.7 Species Serotype(s) failed to detect only serotype 31. previous reports suggested that FilmArray v1.6 had a lower limit of detection for adenovirus. adenovirus prevalences were 1.3% for March 2012 and 2.5% in 2013. this is the first study to evaluate the performance of the revised filmArray respiratory virus panel version 1.7. the revised version 1.7 includes a second adenovirus assay designed to improve upon the poor adenovirus detection of version 1.6. retrospectively calculated sensitivity was significantly higher than the prospective evaluation. sensitivity is now somewhere between 83 and 91%, which supports the decision by the FDA to remove the adenovirus warning present in the package insert. filmArray tested 39 clinically significant adenovirus serotypes at concentrations of 1.0 107 copies/ml. this concentration was selected because it was approximately 1 log unit above the LOD previously published by Couturier and colleagues (12). Interestingly, version 1.7 failed to detect serotype 31. v1.6 and v1.7 significantly improves the detection of adenovirus from respiratory specimens. this is likely due to an increased ability to detect a wider range of serotypes with a lower LOD than had been previously reported."}
