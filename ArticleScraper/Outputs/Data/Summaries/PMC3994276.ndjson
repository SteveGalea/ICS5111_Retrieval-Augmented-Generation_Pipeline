{"summary": "NDV generates long double-stranded RNA molecules during transcription of single-stranded genomic RNA. protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by dsRNA. PKR knockdown remarkably decreased eIF2 phosphorylation. ubiquitously expressed PKR is present in an inactive form at a low abundance. it is activated by conformational change and autophosphorylation upon binding of dsRNA. PKR has been demonstrated to serve as a PRR in the mediation of IFN production in west Nile virus (WNV) infection. PKR is also required for IFN production in response to other RNA viruses. neuraminidase, the matrix protein, and the ribonucleoprotein complex are necessary for viral transcription and replication. NDV infection reportedly leads to the upregulation of total PKR mRNA in the spleen of specific pathogen-free chickens. previous reports also showed that PKR is not required for induction of IFN upon NDV infection. cell pellets were collected at 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection. infection by NDV strains LaSota or Herts/33 strongly induced PKR activation at 12 and 24 hpi. phosphorylation of eIF2, the substrate of phosphorylated PKR, was observed at 12 and 24 hpi. PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation levels in HeLa cells inoculated with replication-competent or UV-inactivated NDV strain Herts/33. the results showed that neither PKR nor eIF2 was phosphorylated at all timepoints post-infection. dsRNAs were detected by immunofluorescenct staining with the specific anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody J2. the secondary antibody was Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (red) the results showed that siPKR efficiently impaired endogenous PKR expression. Representative results are shown with graphs representing the ratio of PKR to -actin normalized to the control condition. data are presented as means from three independent experiments. significance was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. PKR overexpression resulted in a decrease of viral NP synthesis. extracellular viral yields were decreased by 4.9-fold in cells overexpressing PKR infected with NDV strain Herts/33. eIF2 plays a critical role in NDV replication. eIF2 phosphorylation was defined as a protein phosphatase inhibitor, promoting eIF2 phosphorylation. PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation were significantly increased in OA-treatment cell, compared with that in mock cells. eIF2 is critical for NDV replication. the extracellular virus yields were determined at 12 hpi and expressed as TCID50/mL. significance was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. we first infected with HeLa cells with NDV strain Herts/33. we assessed the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid used as a positive control. the folds of mRNA expression were calculated by the formula of comparative CT method. data are presented as means from three independent experiments. significance was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s test. western blot analysis results showed that PKR and eIF2 could be phosphorylated by NDV strains LaSota and Herts/33 in a dose-dependent manner. the cells were infected with NDV strain LaSota (A) or Herts33 (B) at an MOI of 1 and harvested at 6, 12, and 24 hpi. the results showed that neither PKR nor eIF2 was phosphorylated at all timepoints post-infection. total PKR protein content was not increased, suggesting that IFN-induced responses were not fully activated in the early phase of NDV infection. the results showed that siPKR efficiently impaired endogenous PKR expression. the reduction of endogenous PKR resulted in an apparent increase in viral NP synthesis. the increase of virus titer in the supernatant of PKR knockdown cells was also analyzed and measured. significance was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. at 24 hpi, the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-PKR. the protein levels were determined with anti-PKR or anti-NP antibodies. -actin was used as a protein loading control. eIF2 plays a critical role in NDV replication. PKR-induced eIF2 phosphorylation followed by translation inhibition has been shown to play a role in inhibition of viral replication. green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing NDV ZJ1 strain (ZJ1-GFP) was used. interfering with eIF2 dephosphorylation pharmacologically led to an approximate 3-fold decrease in intracellular ZJ1-GFP replication. eIF2 phosphorylation by active PKR induces an antiviral effect in NDV-infected cells. the cells were harvested and then processed as described for Figure 1A. E and F. The intensity band ratio of peIF2 (E) or pPKR (F) to -actin normalized to the control condition. data are presented as means from three independent experiments. dramatic elevation of IFN- mRNA levels in NDV-treated cells coincided with phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2. PKR knockdown significantly suppressed IFN- production. PKR-specific siRNA (100 pmol/mL) or control siRNA for 48 h and then inoculated with NDV strain Herts/33 at an MOI of 1. cells were harvested and analyzed by western blot analysis to determine the efficiency of siRNAs. the correlation between PKR and NDV has been suggested by the fact that NDV infection induces PKR phosphorylation and subsequently inhibits host gene translation [28]. a later study showed that the expression of the NDV nonstructural protein V decreased PKR activation. mAb J2 recognizing the dsRNA molecules was used to confirm the generation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells infected with either lentogenic or velogenic NDV strains. UV treatment impairs the ability of NDV to replicate. subsequent PKR-eIF2 signaling was blocked. the 134.5 protein of the herpes simplex virus 1 binds to protein phosphatase 1a (PP1) and is required to prevent the shut-off of protein synthesis resulting from phosphorylation of the a subunit of eIF-2. we mimic the up-regulation of eIF-2 phosphorylation by using OA, an inhibitor of the serine/theorine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. PKR deficiency did not prevent IFN- responses to NDV infection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. previous report has shown that PKR is not required for induction of IFN upon NDV infection [15]. a reasonable possibility that these observations might be related to different cell models used in various experiments. the velogenic strain Herts/33 and recombinant NDV ZJ1 strain expressing GFP (ZJ1-GFP) were provided by Xiufan Liu (Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China) to obtain incomplete viral replication, viral suspensions were irradiated with UV-C at 75 mWs/cm2 using a low-pressure mercury vapor discharge lamp. al anti-NP mAb was generated using the NP of LaSota strain as an antigen expressed in a prokaryotic system. sequences encoding the full length of NP gene were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. expression was induced by treatment with 0.5 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM Na d by incubation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) the samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and then blocked using Tris buffered saline (TBS) solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk for 2 h. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with Herts/33 strain at an MOI of 1 and harvested at 12 hpi.

VO4) containing protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.5 g/mL), aprotinin (0.5 g/mL), and pepstatin (0.7 g/mL) cells were sonicated for 1 second using a Vibra Cell VCX130 sonicator (Sonics Vibra cell; Sonics & Material, Newtown, CT, USA), boiled for 5 min, and then cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 1 plasmid DNA was prepared using the HiSpeed plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the transfection procedure was performed essentially as described in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, but with minor modifications. real-time PCR Total RNA of HeLa cells infected with NDV strain Herts/33 or PKR-silenced HeLa cells were extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and then reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript\u00ae III First-Strand Synthesis System kit (invitrogen) cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA/PBS) then stained with mouse mAb J2 (Scicons, Hungary) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime) (863 Program) (2011AA10A209), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31372421), the Chinese Special Fund for Agro-scientific research in the public interest (201003012, 201303033 and 201303038)."}
