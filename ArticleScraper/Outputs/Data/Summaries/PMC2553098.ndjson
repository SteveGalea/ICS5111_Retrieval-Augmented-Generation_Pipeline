{"summary": "Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis. it is the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) it is estimated that more than 3 billion individuals have been immunized with BCG. over 100 million doses of BCG are administered annually. as many as 49 production substrains have been used at one time or another in various parts of the world [13], including the four major BCG vaccines in current use. the relative protective efficacy of BCG substrains is currently unknown [6,15]. earliest whole genome comparisons confirmed that BCG was indeed related to, but distinct from M. tb and M. bovis [17-19] we have used a tiling array platform developed by NimbleGen Systems. this technique allows high resolution detections of sequence polymorphisms. polymorphisms affect genes that are known virulence factors. a total of 4 novel deletions and 2 duplications were identified in our analysis. two deletions specific to BCG-Moreau were identified. the first is a 975 bp deletion that eliminates the distal end of fadD26. the two deletions and DU-Tice were confirmed by PCR application and DNA sequencing. the second novel polymorphism in BCG-Moreau is an 1128 bp deletion within Rv3887c/BCG3942c. the deletion of whiB3 in M. bovis attenuates in vivo growth in guinea pigs [40]. TrcR is the response regulator of the TrcR-TrcS two-component system. the strain exhibits increased lethality in SCID mice [41]. the ratio of the reference (M. tb H37Rv) probe intensity (Cy5) was divided by the test (BCG strain) probe intensity (Cy3). if the test genome contains an amplification event (increased copy number when compared to the reference), then the reference/test ratio will shift below 1. ESX-5 is absent from the genome of the fast-growing, non-pathogenic M. smegmatis. ESX-5 is present in both the M. avium complex and M. marinum. it has been suggested that the ESX clusters evolved via gene duplication. a single point mutation (S219L) in the DNA binding region of PhoP partially accounts for the attenuation of the H37Ra strain of M. tb. a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice infections [47]. a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice IS6110 insertion in the promoter region of phoP was found in a clinical strain of M. bovis termed B strain, which was responsible for a severe nosocomial outbreak of multidrug resistant TB in humans in Spain. unlike the three BCG strains, the IS6110 insertion in the M. bovis B strain is located at 75 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP and is in the same orientation as phoP-phoR. this deletion changes the amino acid sequence of 54 residues (residues 432 to 485) in the C-terminal of PhoR. this polymorphism is different than the previously described 10 bp deletion within phoR present in BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo. BCG-Frappier also contains a single nucleotide deletion. no SNP in BCG-Russia or -Japan D322G mutant in BCG-Moreau Birkhaug Sweden ND NA 11 bp deletion within ORF Mutated 54 residues of the C-terminal Prague Single base insertion within ORF Mutated 94 residues of the C-terminal China SNP within ORF P151S mutant ND NA The sequences of phoP-phoR in BCG-Phipps, BCG-Tice, and B a total of 4 novel deletions and 2 duplications were identified. the first is a 975 bp deletion (Table 1) that eliminates the distal end of fadD26 (Rv2930/BCG2952) and the start of ppsA (Rv2931/BCG2953) these genes are part of the genetic locus required for the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glyco novel polymorphism in BCG-Moreau is an 1128 bp deletion within Rv3887c/BCG3942c (Table 1). this region overlaps with a 2.4-kb deletion (termed RDpan) found in some M. bovis strains [36], including the sequenced strain, AF2122/97 [30]. loss of the Rv3887c/BCG3942c membrane transporter likely eliminates the secretion of ESAT-6- and C deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype. DU-Birkhaug is distinguished by a strain-specific duplication. this spans the origin of replication and is analogous to DU1 duplication. novel duplication (DU-Birkhaug) identified in BCG-Birkhaug. the exact border of DU-Tice is mapped using primers specific to the junction. DU-Tice encodes the ESX-5 secretion system. the role of ESX-5 in virulence has been demonstrated in M. marinum [37,42]. it has been suggested that the ESX clusters evolved via gene duplication [43] and DU-Tice offers the first snapshot of such an event. a single point mutation (S219L) in the DNA binding region of PhoP partially accounts for the attenuation of the H37Ra strain of M. tb [26,46-48] a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice infections. our NimbleGen analysis revealed some weak signals in the phoP-phoR region. an IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter was found in a clinical strain of M. bovis termed B strain. it was responsible for a severe nosocomial outbreak of multidrug resistant TB in humans in Spain. unlike the three BCG strains, the IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter is located at 75 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP and is in the same orientation as phoP-phoR [50] BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo also contain a single nucleotide deletion. this mutation changes the C-terminal sequence (residues 154\u2013247) of PhoP. single point mutations in phoP or PhoR are also found in various BCG strains. no SNP in BCG-Russia or -Japan D322G mutant in BCG-Moreau Birkhaug Sweden ND NA 11 bp deletion within ORF Mutated 54 residues of the C-terminal Prague Single base insertion within ORF Mutated 94 residues of the C-terminal China SNP within ORF P151S mutant ND NA The sequences of phoP-phoR in BCG-Phipps, BCG-Tice, and B the NimbleGen technique has a limited ability to detect SNPs. the majority of changes detected by the technique are also present in BCG-Pasteur. this suggests that the loss of RD1 and the accumulation of point mutations during the 230 passages in vitro likely account for the initial loss of virulence by 1921. the expression level of phoP was found to be higher in BCG-Japan than in BCG-Pasteur [24]. however, how IS6110 upregulates phoP expression in BCG is not immediately apparent. it was shown that phoP protein binds to three 9-bp direct repeats within the phoP promoter sequence. the deletion of fadD26-ppsA provides a genetic mechanism for the defective PDIM/PGL biosynthesis in BCG-Moreau. however, this region is intact in BCG-Japan and BCG-Glaxo. previous studies indicated that these strains differ from other early BCG strains only by the loss of the IS6110 element described above. phoR is required for the biosynthesis of trehalose-containing cell wall lipids. the role of phoR in virulence is less understood than for phoP. phoR mutation has been acquired by different groups of BCG strains. the phoP mutation detected in the current study may explain the weakest ability to induce delayed type hypersensitivity to tuberculin in children [63] or in guinea pig models. a phoP mutant of M. tb was more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur and confers an equivalent protection in mice against M. tb challenge. DU-Tice contains the entire ESX-5 secretion system. it is one of the five types VII secretion systems found in the M. tb complex. ESX-5 is conserved in other pathogenic mycobacteria. ESX-5 does not complement loss of virulence caused by deletion. these polymorphisms affect genes that are well known to have major impact on the virulence of M. tb or M. bovis. these include genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid virulence factors PDIMs/PGLs. current collection of BCG comprises natural mutants of established virulence factors identified thus far. mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, BCG-Russia (ATCC 35740), BCG-Moreau/Rio de Janeiro, BCG-Japan, BCG-Sweden, BCG-Birkhaug (ATCC 35731), BCG-China, BCG-Prague, BCG-Glaxo (ATCC 35741), BCG-Tice (ATCC 35743), BCG-Conn microarray hybridization Labeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer at 42\u00b0C for 16 hr. labeled genomic DNA (5 g) from the reference strain M. tb H37Rv and from each BCG strain were co-hybridized to each array. microarrays were scanned at 5 m resolution using the Genepix\u00ae 4000B scanner. pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleGen software. sample sequences corresponding to all possible mutation sites were selected for resequencing. all BCG strains except BCG-China have been previously described. all BCG strains except BCG-China have been previously described. all probes were synthesized in parallel on a four-array set. labeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer at 42\u00b0C for 16 hr. pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleGen software. s per base position were analyzed, 4 per genome strand. the perfectly matched probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatched probes for each strand. the differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely. this work was supported by an award from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and research grants from Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and a grant from Beijing Municipal Science And Technology Commission (BZ)"}
