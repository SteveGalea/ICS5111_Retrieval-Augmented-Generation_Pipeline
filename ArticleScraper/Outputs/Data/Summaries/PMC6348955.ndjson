{"summary": "international deployment is a common occurrence in the united states (US) Armed Forces, comprising of the Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Army. Leaving the US and its native biosphere for their posted sites introduces a risk of exposure to, and infection with, endemic parasitic, bacterial, viral or fungal diseases. these pathogens have significantly impacted local economic development, limited infrastructure, and reduced life expectancy of nationals. the risk of bioterrorism, domestic or foreign, from increasingly radical groups is growing all over the world. this review will address only two of such infections: malaria and leishmaniasis. the seriousness of these diseases and their implications for healthcare system within the homeland demands critical analysis. survey methodology For the purpose of this review, we divided the article into sections and disease-specific subsections, focusing on specific diseases, one at a time. armed forces, deployment, malaria, leishmaniasis, epidemiology, military-related autochthonous parasitic diseases, prevention and treatment. update from 2017 reveal 32 cases of malaria infection among US military stationed overseas. cases reported from facilities as far as Afghanistan, Korea, Japan, Djibouti. total reduction in malaria cases in recent years has been ascribed to US troops leaving the Middle East region. malaria is no longer endemic in the united states, healthcare providers may see a patient presenting with symptoms similar to flu symptoms. symptoms of P. vivax malaria are consistent with all types of malaria: fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, myalgia, fatigue, and general malaise. successful implementation of all five strategies is rare. successful implementation of all five strategies is rare. successful implementation of all five strategies is rare. sequelae mimic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition for which deployed servicemen are at high risk. side effects rare, and when present can range from nausea/vomiting and esophagitis to psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety. since 2001, 2.4 million US troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. leishmaniasis is clinically relevant for armed forces and refugees alike. number of animal species which can serve as Leishmania reservoir hosts is ever increasing. cutaneous (including diffuse cutaneous form), mucocutaneous, or visceral. 90% of global CL cases occur in Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the u.s. Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for the period 2001\u20132016. the majority of cases were CL (Stahlman, Williams & Taubman, 2017). the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the united states Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years. there are no effective chemoprophylaxis drugs and no fully developed vaccines. the preventative techniques that do exist focus on avoiding the bite of infected sandflies. in 2003 alone, the incidence rate was estimated at 200 per 1,000 soldiers. military zoonotic leishmaniasis canines are one of the main reservoirs for leishmania species. zoonotic transmission of L. infantum to humans often results in visceral leishmaniasis infection. military personnel at higher risk of smoking/alcohol/substance-abuse initiation and recidivism. personnel who have served in the Middle East since the Persian Gulf War have reported higher levels of psychosomatic/psychological pain in comparison to cohort military personnel that served contemporarily but in other locations. troops are at a relatively high risk of zoonotic canine leishmaniasis due to exposure and high prevalence of immunodeficiency/extreme stress secondary to their service. Approximately 1,000 former-MWDs enter the US annually (Killian, 2007), potentially serving as a reservoir for leishmania. both symptomatic and asymptomatic canines have similar inoculation abilities (Moshfe et al., 2009), and canL prevalence has been shown to correlate with that of human disease. malaria is endemic to much of the world, and the u.s. military will likely continue to engage in endemic areas. drug-resistant strains of malaria have been found, indicating the need for further preventative measures. ongoing civil conflicts in Syria compounds the growing and untenable numbers of individuals symptomatic for disease or sub-clinically infected. this further compounds disease status among deployed servicemen and women returning to the west, igniting the need for expanding infectious disease experts into current healthcare system. despite clinical notoriety and insidiousness of more 100 years, the worldwide threat of malaria in endemic countries remains. at its apex in the Middle East, the United States Armed Forces suffered an incident rate of 52.4 cases per 1,000 troops. of recent, there has been a significant reduction in the number of troops stationed in these locations. the dominant species causing infection among the armed forces is P. vivax (Ciminera & Brundage, 2007), although the latest update on malaria in the military shows a shift to increasing infections with P. falciparum. it is uniquely dangerous in that infected patients may remain subclinical for years after returning home from military service. there are five major malaria prevention strategies. permethrin is an insecticide that kills mosquitoes by inducing spasms and paralysis. despite inclusion in malaria prevention programs, both chemicals have known associated risks. synergism has been observed during simultaneous exposure to DEET and permethrin, leading to neuronal degeneration and significant neurobehavioral effects. chemoprophylactic drugs (doxycycline or mefloquine) administered by the military also have known adverse effects, associated with use. both primaquine and tafenoquine should be made available for the treatment of u.s. military servicemen and women deployed overseas. the dominant species causing infection among the military is P. vivax (Ciminera & Brundage, 2007). the symptoms of P. vivax malaria are consistent with all types of malaria. malaria is no longer endemic in the united states, healthcare providers may see a patient presenting with symptoms similar to flu symptoms. this leads to delays in diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment. chemoprophylactic drugs (doxycycline or mefloquine) have known associated dangers. chemoprophylactic drugs (doxycycline or mefloquine) also have known adverse effects. side effects can be extreme, including psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, paranoia, depression, hallucinations, and psychosis. doxycycline is by far safer and more reliable; side effects rare, and when present can range from nausea/vomiting and esophagitis. more than twenty leishmania species have been identified. the parasite is considered endemic throughout the world. the parasite is clinically relevant for armed forces and refugees alike. disease manifests as three distinct clinical forms: cutaneous (including diffuse cutaneous form), mucocutaneous, or visceral. cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most diagnosed among deployed United States servicemen and women. 90% of global CL cases occur in Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the united states Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for the period of 2001\u20132016. the majority of cases were CL (Stahlman, Williams & Taubman, 2017). the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the united states Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years. the first line of protection from CL is through the use of personal protection techniques. there are no effective chemoprophylaxis drugs and no fully developed vaccines. the preventative techniques that do exist focus on avoiding the bite of infected sandflies. Sodium stibogluconate is efficacious, but development of new drugs is imperative due to these side effect, the threat of drug resistance, and the high cost ($100 per 100 mL) leishmaniasis was not traditionally considered endemic to the united states, although recent epidemiologic findings reveal this status may be changing. cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has been the most diagnosed of the three among deployed United States servicemen and women. 90% of global CL cases occur in Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia. the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the u.s. Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for the period 2001\u20132016. the majority of cases were CL (Stahlman, Williams & Taubman, 2017). the incidence rate of leishmaniasis among the united states Armed Forces was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for the period 2001\u20132016. there are no effective chemoprophylaxis drugs and no fully developed vaccines. the preventative techniques that do exist focus on avoiding the bite of infected sandflies. the most effective treatment is sodium stibogluconate, given intravenously for 20 days. military zoonotic leishmaniasis canines are one of the main reservoirs for leishmania species (Burza, Croft & Boelaert, 2018; Quinnell & Courtenay, 2009), with cases often subclinical. military personnel are at higher risk of smoking/alcohol/substance-abuse initiation and recidivism. personnel who have served in the Middle East since the Persian Gulf War have reported higher levels of psychosomatic/psychological pain. troops are at a relatively high risk of zoonotic canine leishmaniasis due to exposure (military dogs becoming infected, local dogs in endemic areas) and high prevalence of immunodeficiency/extreme stress secondary to their service. Approximately 1,000 former-MWDs enter the US annually (Killian, 2007), potentially serving as a reservoir for leishmania. both symptomatic and asymptomatic canines have similar inoculation abilities (Moshfe et al., 2009), and canL prevalence has been shown to correlate with that of human disease. malaria is endemic to much of the world, and the u.s. military will likely continue to engage in endemic areas. drug-resistant strains of malaria have been found, indicating the need for further preventative measures. ahman et al., 2010; Orsborne et al., 2016; ahman et al., 2010; orsborne et al., 2016); ahman et al., 2010; orsborne et al., 2016; ahman et al., 2010; orsborne et al., 2016; ahman et al., 2010; orsborne et al., leishmaniasis CL is found primarily in the Middle East, and the US military continues to be at risk of infection. the disease burden in the Middle East is estimated at 100,000 cases annually, indicating that exposure risk remains significant. ongoing civil conflicts in Syria compounds the growing and untenable numbers of individuals symptomatic for disease or sub-clinically infected. parasitic diseases are common in most deployment locations of the u.s. military. most are not yet preventable with vaccines, and the treatments and prophylaxis that are available are accompanied by many side effects."}
