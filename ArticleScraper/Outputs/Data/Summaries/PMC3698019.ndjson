{"summary": "acute viral pharyngitis may be easily misdiagnosed as acute bacterial pharyngitis. laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory viruses is recommended. virological investigation should be considered for patients with acute pharyngitis. the nasal wash (NW) has generally been considered superior to swab specimens. however, obtaining a wash may be unpleasant to the patient. a swab with a nylon tip and plastic applicator was inserted into one of the nostrils until slight resistance was felt at the nasopharynx. the swab was then rotated two to three times, held in place for 5 seconds, and withdrawn. the NW process was repeated in the other nostril if less than 2 ml of fluid was retrieved. the washes were placed into a sterile container for transport to the laboratory. samples were stored at 4\u00b0C within 6 hours until testing. ethics This study was conducted with approval of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University Ethics Committee. participants recruited 103 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University who had presented with complaints of a sore throat and/or odynophagia within the preceding 3 days. a flexible flocked swab with a nylon tip and plastic applicator was inserted into one of the nostrils until slight resistance was felt at the nasopharynx. the swab was then rotated two to three times, held in place for 5 seconds, and withdrawn. the NW process was repeated in the other nostril if less than 2 ml of fluid was retrieved. specimens with a cycle threshold of 35 were regarded as positive. specimens with a cycle threshold of >35 were regarded as negative. the sensitivity of each sampling method was significantly higher than that of NW. sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (100% [95% CI = 65\u201383] vs. 49% [95% CI = 39\u201360], respectively; p 0.01) for detection of rhinovirus, the sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (100% [95% CI = 78\u2013100] vs. 60% [95% CI = 32\u201384], respectively. all viruses 89 66 74 (65-83)d 44 49 (39-60) 44 49 (39-60) aCI confidence interval. b p 0.05 versus the results for NW and versus OPS. a study by Patrick et al. found that NPS and nasal swab were superior to nasopharyngeal wash for rapid immunoassay. a study by agoritsas et al. found that NPS had a higher sensitivity than NW for detection of respiratory viruses by real-time PCR in children. our findings showed that NPS yielded the highest sensitivity among the three sampling methods. for rhinovirus, NPS had a statistically higher sensitivity than NW. in contrast, NW and OPS produced lower sensitivities of viral detection. the flocked swab design yields significantly more total respiratory epithelial cells and more infected respiratory epithelial cells than does the conventional rayon swab. nasopharyngeal samples reportedly have advantages over oropharyngeal samples for the identification of common respiratory viruses. Y-YL and Y-FW performed the laboratory work. all authors participated in the data analysis. LL and Q-Y C drafted the manuscript."}
