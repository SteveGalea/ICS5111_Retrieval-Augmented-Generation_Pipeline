{"summary": "a vaccination strategy to control emerging diseases will require a more effective and rapid response than available from conventional approaches such as live-attenuated vaccines. the current novel swine derived H1N1 pandemic further exemplifies the need for a rapid and effective vaccine against emerging pathogens. immunization with DNA could result in the production of foreign proteins or antigens that stimulate the immune system. it is thought that after immunization, transfected muscle cells may produce antigen or foreign proteins that then directly stimulate the immune system, which in turn produce antibodies. transfected muscle cells could possibly transfer the antigen to so-called antigen presenting cells which result in the display of different processed fragments of expressed proteins (antigens) the process of antigen production by host cells after DNA vaccination mimics the production of antigens during a natural infection. the resulting immune response is thought to be similar to the type induced by pathogens. DNA vaccination generates antigens in their native form. immunity to more than one component of the organism may require stimulation of different components of the host immune system. a significant advantage, especially for emerging pathogens, is that DNA vaccines do not require the handling of potentially deadly infectious agents. a well-tolerated safety profile has been observed in human clinical trials of DNA vaccination. plasmid DNA vaccines are noninfectious, but significant immune responses are not developed against the plasmid itself. however, only specific immune responses to the expressed antigen are stimulated with this approach. the potential risks of DNA vaccines appear to be minimal based on safety data. unformulated or \"naked\" DNA vaccine targeted the malaria parasite. more than half of the subjects were shown to have cells that can kill or lyse malaria infected cells. a recent clinical trial showed that the vaccine stimulated antibodies that inhibited the virus. individuals exhibited potent antibody responses to a hepatitis B DNA vaccine with the PMED approach. needle-free devices have been used in numerous clinical studies. needle-free injection of DNA vaccines appears to be well-tolerated. some researchers have used plasmid DNA in what has been called a \"prime-boost\" vaccination approach. this involves delivery of one or more plasmid DNA vaccine priming doses followed by a boost with a viral vector (such as adenovirus) the method involves delivery of one or more plasmid DNA vaccine priming doses followed by a boost with an adenoviral vector. poly-lactide coglycolide (PLG) was one of the earliest promising adjuvants for plasmid DNA vaccines. some poloxamers are nonionic block copolymers, and bond with DNA to form small particles. the first human clinical trial of a DNA vaccine formulated with Vaxfectin\u00ae has been completed with plasmids that encode pandemic influenza virus antigens (H5N1) all of the vaccinated monkeys developed strong and durable neutralizing antibodies and they became ill with rashes. scientists at aqua health, a unit of Novartis in canada, conducted a field trial by immunizing millions of salmons with a single dose of DNA vaccine encoding for a protein of the virus. the vaccine, called Apex-IHN, protected the fish from death without adverse effects. a therapeutic DNA vaccine designed to treat dogs with skin cancer (melanoma) was granted conditional approval in 2007. since November 2003, approximately 400 cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) have been reported worldwide. the emergence of triple-reassortment swine influenza with limited cross reactivity antibody responses after vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines suggests the need to rapidly produce new vaccines to this emerging virus. transfected muscle cells could transfer the antigen to so-called antigen presenting cells. the process of antigen production by host cells after DNA vaccination mimics the production of antigens during a natural infection. the resulting immune response is thought to be similar to the type induced by pathogens. a significant advantage, especially for emerging pathogens, is that DNA vaccines do not require the handling of potentially deadly infectious agents. a significant advantage, especially for emerging pathogens, is that they do not require the handling of potentially deadly infectious agents. increased rates of autoimmunity or anti-DNA antibodies have not been observed in clinical trials of DNA vaccination. plasmid DNA vaccines are noninfectious, but significant immune responses are not developed against the plasmid itself. adenoviruses can be generated without diminishing the specific immune response. a plasmid encoded naturally occurring forms of malaria proteins. in some cases, the encoded protein may be sufficiently immunogenic without the need for additional components (unformulated or \"naked\" DNA) such as adjuvants. in some cases, the encoded protein may be sufficiently immunogenic without the need for additional components. needle and syringe is the predominant method to deliver both DNA vaccines as well as conventional vaccines. the method is called \"particle-mediated epidermal delivery\". needle-free devices are also used for the delivery of DNA vaccines. some researchers have used plasmid DNA in what has been called a \"prime-boost\" vaccination approach. this involves delivery of one or more plasmid DNA vaccine priming doses followed by a boost with a viral vector (such as adenovirus) which codes for the same antigens. plasmid DNA vaccination plays an important role in priming different types of T-cells specific for various proteins. MV were then boosted with a live-attenuated CMV virus (Towne strain) faster and stronger virus-specific T-cell responses were observed in the group of subjects that received the DNA and Towne strain compared with a group that received the Towne strain alone. the first human clinical trial of a DNA vaccine formulated with Vaxfectin\u00ae has been completed with plasmids that encode pandemic influenza virus antigens (H5N1) the first DNA vaccine approved for animal health was one that protected horses against WNV. the first DNA vaccine approved for animal health was one that protected horses against WNV. the WNV DNA vaccine was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2005 after the demonstration of safety and efficacy[33]. a DNA vaccine has also been recently approved to prevent a fatal viral disease that afflicts salmon, called infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. DNA vaccines contain no infectious components and can be produced safely without the handling of hazardous infectious agents. there is a well-defined analytical process for the manufacturing of all DNA vaccines, which is universally applicable to any DNA vaccine. the author declares that they have no competing interests. potential advantages of DNA vaccines for emerging pathogens Ability to immunize against multiple antigens and/or pathogens Ability to stimulate both T-cell and antibody immunity Safety profile Nonviral and no induction of anti-vector immunity Ability to repeat injections."}
