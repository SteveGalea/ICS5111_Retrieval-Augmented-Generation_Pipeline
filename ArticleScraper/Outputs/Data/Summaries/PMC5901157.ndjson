{"summary": "bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. this disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. the most commonly detected virus in bronchiolitis is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with the peak incidence of infection taking place in the period of December till March. nearly all children get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old, but only 1\u20132% of infants younger than 6 months of age may require hospitalization. the warm season starts around May 10 and ends approximately September 26 with an average daily high temperature above 37\u00b0C. the chance of precipitation is 1% during the warm season and almost 15% during the cold season. nasopharyngeal secretions were performed on nasopharyngeal secretions. nasopharyngeal secretions included pandemic influenza A H1N1, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, coronavirus, novel coronavirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus. the likelihood ratio statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that no seasonality was present. the autoregressive integrated moving average model procedure estimates the equivalent of the least-square parameter estimates of a regression model. a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate. the series exhibited several peaks; aside from the small range fluctuations, the significant peak appeared to be separated by more than a few months. the peak of RSV cases follows a similar pattern with an interval of few months between the peaks. despite the seasonal peaks, it is obvious that the RSV contributes to almost 50% of all bronchiolitis cases in the state of Qatar. in the developed countries, the mean LOS in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis is 6 days, while Germany reports 9 days. the investigators registered year-round RSV activity in nine major cities. the study concluded that in moderate weather, RSV activity peaked during winter, corresponding to lower temperatures. states that had hot summers such as Arizona and new Mexico did not differ much from the national average RSV season. a total of 200 nasopharyngeal aspirates was acquired and RSV was demonstrated in 12.5% of patients. most of the infections were linked with bronchiolitis. the epidemic started in December and vanished in March with a peak of incidence during February 2003 and January 2004. bronchiolitis affects infants and children throughout the year. bronchiolitis affects infants and children throughout the year. the combination of uninterrupted RSV seasonality and prolonged hospital LOS in children can provide factual guidance. ulin series."}
