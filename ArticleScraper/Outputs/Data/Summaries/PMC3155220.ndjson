{"summary": "therapies based on nucleic acids (NAs), antisense and antigene oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, DNA and RNA aptamers and small interfering RNAs have been developed over the past couple of decades. the sequencing of the human genome and the transcriptome and proteome projects are providing additional platforms for the advancement of NA-based therapies. the innate ability of these drugs to cross membranes is minimal in normal circumstances. the innate ability of these drugs to cross membranes is minimal in normal circumstances. however, their low biostability results in unpredictable pharmacokinetics. antisense technology is based on the introduction of a complementary oligonucleotide sequence to the target mRNA. nucleotide-long siRNAs induced into the cell activate the RISC complex leading to degradation of target mRNA. small double stranded RNAs (termed small interfering RNAs \u2013 siRNAs) are produced by the cleavage of long dsRNAs. the cytoplasmic, highly conserved Dicer protein forms a characteristical 21\u201323-nucleotide long dsRNA duplex with symmetric two- to three-nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs. RISC can either specifically cleave and degrade target m cleavage reaction guided by RISC does not require ATP. but multiple rounds of mRNA cleavage are more efficient in presence of ATP. miRNA-guided mechanism of translational regulation is not as well understood. RNAi is iometric in relation to homologous mRNA. it involves a catalytic stage and cannot be based on the titration of endogenous mRNA. siRNA drugs are being developed in order to inhibit cell infection by HIV. VEGF gene expression was the first target for clinical trials using siRNA in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. RNAi is also being used to combat infection by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome. success of these trials may be due to the direct administration of siRNAs at the diseased organs. siRNA molecules consisting entirely of 2\u2032-O-methyl and 2\u2032-fluoro-modified nucleotides demonstrated enhanced plasma stability and increased in vitro potency. judicious combination of 4\u2032-thioribose with 2\u2032-O-Me and 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl modifications demonstrated enhanced plasma stability. selective cycles are carried out by incubating the target protein or another molecule of biological importance with the combinatorial DNA or RNA pool. increased stringency can be achieved by increasing the number of DNA or RNA molecules relative to possible target binding sites. an intracellular acting aptamer (intramer) is an RNA molecule selected as high-affinity ligand of the protein. the protein is expressed during Drosophila development and acts there in the gene-splicing process. aptamer binds the intracellular domain of the \u20132 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). the addition of antibiotics to the cell system resulted in the shut down of the 5\u2032-gene transcription. intramers bind and switch off the cytohesin-2 guanine nucleotide exchanger but do not affect the homologous protein cytohesin-1 that has a different function. this effect was observed following six hours of cell transfection with the aptamer construct. aptamer targets factor IXa (drug, RB006) with anti-coagulation activity. both aptamer drug and antidote were well tolerated. aptamers can be chemically modified to acquire more stability for in vivo applicatons. aptamers can be easily enzymatically reproduced or produced in a large scale by chemical synthesis. the phenomenon of RNAi was first observed in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans in response to a double-stranded RNA treatment which resulted in sequence-specific gene silencing. the duplex small-interfering (si)-RNAs are integrated into the RISC complex. the complex becomes activated by the unwinding of the duplex upon the loss of one strand of the si-RNA duplex by an RNA helicase activity. RISC can either specifically cleave and degrade target mRNA. target mRNA contains three-prime untranslated regions with several binding sites for the miRNA. both the target and the miRNA were found to be associated with polyribosomes. this suggests that miRNAs block translation elongation or termination rather than translational initiation. VEGF gene expression was the first target for clinical trials using siRNA in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. RNAi is also being used to combat infection by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome. success of these trials may be due to the direct administration of siRNAs at the diseased organs. the siRNA ALN-RSV01 developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for treatment of RSV infection has completed two phase 1 trials. other siRNAs targeting Influenza and hepatitis C viruses (Protiva Biotherapeutics) are expected to be available for clinical use within the coming year. a DNA library is synthesized containing an inner randomized sequence of typically 20\u2013100 nucleotides flanked by two outer constant regions of 20\u201340 nucleotides. the chemically synthesized DNA pool is amplified by PCR in the presence of sense- and anti-sense-primers. in many cases 2\u2032-F-modified pyrimidines are employed in the in vitro transcription reaction to improve nuclease-resistance of generated aptamers with binding affinity to target can be used for basic research, clinical and diagnostic purposes. aptamers with unique binding characteristics, also denominated as aptamers can be used for basic research, clinical and diagnostic purposes. intramers may be an alternative to RNAi by specifically suppressing the activity of gene products instead of inducing degradation of mRNAs coding for these proteins. the ability to modulate intramer activity would drastically increase the efficiency of regulation of intracellular signaling by oligonucleotides. anti-VEGF165 aptamer was developed that blocks pathological VEGF165-receptor binding, leaving other vital VEGF isoform action unaffected. aptamer targets factor IXa (drug, RB006) with anti-coagulation activity. aptamers may be used in diagnostic applications, such as differentiating between normal and tumoral vasculature. aptamers can be chemically modified to acquire more stability for in vivo applicatons. aptamers can be easily enzymatically reproduced or produced in a large scale. a wide variety of address-molecules have been investigated for their effectiveness to deliver oligonucleotides to cancer cells. humanized antibodies and single chain variable fragments generated by murine hybridomas or phage displayed. minibodies and peptides were among the tested delivery vehicles. aptamers developed against PSMA as protein or another molecule of biological importance potent target binders can be used instead of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. gelonin (Gel) is a protein toxin with n-glycosidase activity promoting cell death by cleavage of a specific glycosidic bond of rRNA. kine VEGF was coupled to gelonin and the conjugate specifically killed cancer cells overexpressing the VEGF receptor FLT-1. Previously selected RNA aptamers specifically binding to PSMA were used to escort Gel to tumoral cells expressing PSMA at their surface. the conjugated toxin destroyed prostate cancer cells with an IC50 value of 27 nM. chimeric pRNA complex was processed into functional double-stranded siRNA by the RNA-specific endonuclease Dicer. chimeric pRNA complex was found to be processed into functional double-stranded siRNA by the RNA-specific endonuclease Dicer. the incubation of protein-free nanoscale particles containing a receptor-binding aptamer may result in the binding and internalization of the trivalent therapeutic particles (Dtxl-NP-Apt or PLA-PEG-COOH-Apt) subsequently modulating prostate cancer cell apoptosis. therapeutic and diagnostic nanoparticle-aptamer bioconjugates will be shortly developed for other important human diseases. PLGA may be locally applied, allowing intralesional administration of drugs while minimizing adverse systemic effects. adverse side effects resulted from the sclerotomy as result of the delivery procedure of small encapsulated synthetic drugs. TAR is a 57 nucleotide regulatory element present at the 5\u2032 end of every viral RNA particle. it exerts a crucial role on viral transcription, as it is recognized by the ternary complex composed of the Tat viral protein. a TAR binder could interfere with the ribosomal machinery. conopka and collaborators used cationic liposomes as delivery vessels. cationic liposomes act against the HIV-1 env gene inhibiting viral production. these data provide strong evidence for therapeutical potential of NA ligands as anti-HIV agents. judge et al. (2005) made use of siRNA duplexes formulated in stable NA lipid particles (SNALPs) to attain gene silencing of apoB in mice. aptamers bind with low nanomolar affinity to extracellular portion of PSMA. the rate of internalization has been previously measured using antibodies directed against PSMA and also in the presence of the anti-PSMA aptamer A10. inhibition of target-gene expression was detected after 72 h of siRNA-aptamer transfection. aptamer-siRNAs are directed into the RNAi pathway and silence their cognate mRNAs. theophylline-binding aptamer (Jenison et al. 1994; Zimmermann et al. 1997) is a protein toxin with n-glycosidase activity promoting cell death by cleavage of a specific glycosidic bond of rRNA. aptamer-bound theophylline interfered with the Dicer-cleavage site. a recombinant Gel (rGel) was developed in order to improve its cytotoxicity. the recombinant variant provoked some toxicity on target cells. membrane-permeability was not significantly improved. this problem was solved by chemical conjugation of rGel or its genetic fusion. txl-NP-Apt bioconjugates were easily incorporated by prostate epithelial cells. aptamer-nanoparticle bioconjugates also presented remarkable efficacy. pRNA was genetically engineered to originate chimeric RNA. d and collaborators (2004) synthesized a polylactic acid copolymer with a carboxilic terminal functional group (PLA-PEG-COOH) nanoparticles have negatively charged carboxilic groups on their surfaces, which minimize unspecific interactions with negatively charged NAs. the presence of anti-PSMA aptamers at target cells is increased 77-fold when it is bioconjugated to a nanoparticle. the use of this route of administration could avoid problems and limitations of other delivery approaches in the treatment of viral and systemic diseases. the ideal approach would be to develop biodegradable polimeric particles with prolonged delivery capacity. aptamer (Macugen) is a 57 nucleotide regulatory element present at the 5\u2032 end of every viral RNA particle. it exerts a crucial role on viral transcription. a TAR binder could interfere with the ribosomal machinery. anti-TAR RNA aptamer was optimized by chemical modifications. other aptamers were also developed interfering with HIV-1 gene expression. cationic liposomes used as delivery vessels carrying association of RBEapt. fusion protein (Song et al. 2005) and atelocollagen (Takei et al. 2004) have been shown to facilitate delivery into tumor cells. chimeric RNAs have also been successfully used to facilitate siRNA delivery in vivo. distinct modes of inhibition suggested that each aptamer identifies a unique extracellular epitope of recombinant PSMA (xPSM-A10) these aptamers were the first recognizing specific prostate cancer markers. era\u2013mediated gene silencing is dependent on Dicer activation. inhibition of Dicer activation had no effect on transfected PLK1 siRNA-mediated silencing. chimera A10-siRNA specifically bound to PSMA on surface of LNCaP cells. yrosine kinase inhibitor affects only the leukemic cells caused by fusion of two genes, bcr and abl, a chromosomal shuffling between chromosomes 9 and 22. the oral drug, Gleevec, led to remission in 90% to 95% of CML-relapsed patients. controlled release of drugs at affected tissue sites will lead to the development of \"smart therapeutics\" nanoparticles can be attached to NAs in a way that NA-binding properties to their targets are preserved. these new approaches can supplement the conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer treatment."}
