{"summary": "this article provides a qualitative, historical analysis of cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. it compares and contrasts the actors, relationships, and norms at work in each field. the empirical evidence draws on more than a dozen semistructured interviews with practitioners in public health and cyber defense. specialized knowledge and tools used to detect and treat malware and disease are dual use. this means that they can be used for both benefit and harm or, alternatively, for both military and civilian applications. cyber intelligence is one kind of cyber capability subject to intelligence, as infectious disease is one kind of health-related event. espionage may bring to mind warrantless wiretapping, bulk collection of metadata, and other controversial programs conducted by the national security agency. cyber intelligence may serve as a sentinel case for the forces that stand to reshape disease surveillance in the years ahead. however, cyber intelligence is sufficiently similar to disease surveillance that compare their respective histories and policies can provide useful insight into each field. a compromise on the relationship between disease surveillance and local intervention was a political compromise. the political power afforded by this status and authority was insufficient to overcome countervailing interests. but many physicians opposed surveillance as a threat to clinical authority. organizations for civilian cyber defense emerged in response to communication and coordination problems highlighted by the Morris worm. in 1988, the Morris worm exploited flaws in the Unix operating system to quickly spread, infecting and slowing about 10% of the 60,000 to 80,000 computers that constituted the entire internet at that time. a few weeks later, another hack compromised the US military's network. fewer than half of local law enforcement agencies have a cybercrime unit. the only recourse that most victims have is through a commercial service provider. the u.s. chose a more private and voluntary approach to cyber defense compared to public health. the CDC sought to distinguish its fieldwork in service to the states from research at NIH. CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service was also used to support state and local health officials. CDC is the dominant authority in this field. in 1989, the general accounting office (GAO) argued that internet security required a focal point. in 1991, the National Research Council recommended that the government help establish a nongovernmental organization to serve a similar function. the CERT/CC even pitched a similar proposal in 1997, which was a concession that the CERT/CC had failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. at least 19 sector-specific ISACs were established for financial services, energy, healthcare, and other parts of critical infrastructure. the department of homeland security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of September 11. it built capacity for cyber intelligence through the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) FIRST has grown into an international forum for more than 300 national and industry teams from around the world. unlike the WHO, FIRST did not build on previous international organizations. however, FIRST did not build on international law. the international multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) looks very different from disease surveillance. the modern practice of public health surveillance also reflects important political compromises. the modern practice of public health surveillance reflects important political compromises. public health officials opposed surveillance as a \"demand for unpaid labor\" the compromise was a political compromise, but it endures to this day as a practical constraint on the relationship between disease surveillance and local intervention. the CERT/CC system was a decentralized approach to cyber intelligence. the CERT/CC is not a government agency, in contrast to the health departments that conduct most disease surveillance. the only recourse that most malware victims have is through a commercial service provider, such as an antivirus vendor. despite political resistance, the marine hospital service gained control over quarantine. federal authority can be seen as constrained by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution or empowered by the Commerce Clause. despite political resistance, the marine hospital service eventually gained control over quarantine through bureaucratic empire-building within the federal government. CDC is the dominant authority in this field. it is also the biggest source of public health grant money. the CERT system spread alongside a global marketplace. the CERT/CC failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. the CDC provides more than $3 billion per year. the CDC provides more than $3 billion per year. grants for domestic public health, plus more than $400 million for global health. most of this money is spent on physical rather than cyber security. a year after the Morris worm, the CERT/CC helped respond to the worm. first consists of a small board, a few committees, and an annual conference. it is dwarfed by WHO, which has a $4 billion budget and oversight of surveillance through programs such as GISRS and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network. the history of cyber intelligence provides at least 3 important lessons for disease surveillance. john avlon: cyber intelligence is shaped by politics, particularly the American ideology of \"anti-statism\" he says cyber intelligence is now more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health. avlon: cyber intelligence is now more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health. as underfunded and uncoordinated as disease surveillance may be, it could be worse. if the CDC did not exist, it would be difficult to build this kind of government agency in this day and age. path dependency suggests that the CDC and the WHO will survive, but they should not be taken for granted. the CDC and the department of health and human services should aggressively push the development and adoption of data standards. if harmonized, these standards can create network effects that substantially increase the volume and value of information available. the CDC can be criticized for being a black box into which information flows \"but does not come back\" the goals would be consistent with the CDC's surveillance strategy. the ISAC could help make surveillance more adaptable to the rapidly changing technology landscape. it could provide a forum for stakeholders to share and evaluate heterogeneous data alongside internet-based surveillance. cyber intelligence is shaped by politics, particularly the American ideology of \u201canti-statism.\u201d57. it was politically infeasible to provide cyber intelligence as a public good or service through government. if the CDC did not exist, it would be difficult to build this kind of government agency in this day and age. electronic records are native to the internet, as are the means to share them. but information sharing is limited, which limits how much \u201cbig data\u201d is available and amenable to analysis. this practice may break with sound medical ethics for diagnosing and treating disease. as revolutionary as information technology may be for disease surveillance, they are no panacea. the CDC and HHS should push the development and adoption of data standards, as well as \u201cmeaningful use\u201d criteria for electronic health records to include public health. the CDC can be criticized for being a black box into which information flows \u201cbut does not come back\u201d some cybersecurity experts say about sharing information with intelligence agencies like the NSA. this article provides a foundation for further research. an ISAC for public health surveillance may be found to complement the existing architecture. this field is in touch with information technology, by definition."}
