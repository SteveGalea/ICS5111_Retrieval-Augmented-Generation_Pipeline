{"summary": "influenza infections in piglets and fattening pigs may take a febrile course. they have been considered a cause of prostaglandin-induced abortions and further fertility disorders. influenza is difficult and depends on structural optimization of herd management. serosurveys of swine have shown cocirculation of these three enzootic subtypes in different countries at different prevalences (6). several reassortants between these lines have been detected sporadically, but no further spread of any of these has been reported (7). the most recent human pandemic influenza virus, of subtype H1N1 emerged in 2009 (H1N1pdm virus), is now considered endemic in swine populations in several countries the efficacy of an IAV vaccine depends on a close antigenic match between field and vaccine viruses and is challenged continuously by antigenic shift and drift of field viruses. interference from maternally derived antibodies can cause vaccination failure in piglets (11, 12). the data of this study were established by molecular characterization of samples collected between 2009 and 2010 in northwest Germany. Specimens of lung tissues obtained during postmortem examinations predominantly of weaners with clinical signs of respiratory disease were collected irrespective of further epidemiological stratifications. RNA extraction and detection of viral RNA was performed using the Qiagen viral RNA kit. extracted RNA was then subjected to detection of a fragment of the M gene of the influenza virus RNA genome. samples with Cq values of 30 in the M-gene-specific RT-qPCR were selected for virus isolation in MDCK cell cultures grown in 6-well plates. supernatants of cultures showing cytopathic effects until 72 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C were subpassaged once in MDCK cells in 25-cm2 culture flasks. the hemagglutination titer in the supernatant was measured following a freeze-thaw cycle phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA gene segments was based on alignments of the open reading frames of the HA1 fragment (nucleotides 1 to 1032, representing amino acids [aa] 1 to 344) and of full-length NA (1,401 nucleotides, representing 467 aa) the resulting tree topology was used to identify clusters and the most appropriate outgroup sequences for each cluster. the pigs tested seronegative for influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-specific antibodies in a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) two pigs of each group were nasally infected with 106 tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) in 1 ml of cell culture supernatant. study was mainly restricted to the same area as that for study A. swine herds with pronounced respiratory and fertility problems had a history of respiratory and fertility problems. telephone interviews with consulting veterinarians were carried out on the basis of a pretested and validated questionnaire targeting numerous epidemiological parameters. questionnaire data were recorded with InfoPath, and descriptive statistics were calculated in Excel. extracted RNA was subjected to detection of a fragment of the M gene of the influenza virus RNA genome by real-time reverse transcription PCR. samples with Cq values of 30 in the M-gene-specific RT-qPCR were selected for virus isolation. supernatants of cultures showing cytopathic effects until 72 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C were subpassaged once in MDCK cells in 25-cm2 culture flasks. the hemagglutination titer in the supernatant was measured following a freeze-thaw cycle and clarification of debris. phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA gene segments was based on alignments of the open reading frames of the HA1 fragment (nucleotides 1 to 1032, representing amino acids [aa] 1 to 344) and of full-length NA (1,401 nucleotides, representing 467 aa) reordered alignments were then subjected to analysis in a Bayesian framework. the pigs tested seronegative for influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-specific antibodies in a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) two pigs of each group were nasally infected with 106 tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) in 1 ml of cell culture supernatant. 401 lung tissue specimens obtained from weaners yielded 86 (21.4%) samples positive by M-specific RT-qPCR. of which 36 could be further subtyped, as shown in Table 1. characterization of porcine influenza viruses from selected swine herds in northwest Germany. a total of 2,696 nasal swabs from 382 pig herds originated from study B between March 2011 and March 2012. of these, 40.3% of holdings and 24.4% of samples tested positive for IAV RNA by M-specific RT-qPCR. a double infection with H1N1 and H3N2 was detected. reassortants between H1N1pdm and porcine HxN2 viruses were found more frequently (7.2%). only 15 submissions contained samples from sows and weaners of the same holding. the majority of positive samples originated from weaners aged 7 to 8 weeks. most significant factor appeared to be vaccination against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (P = 0.002) PhyML analysis confirmed the presence of three clearly distinct clusters within german porcine H1 sequences representing descendants of the human seasonal H1 virus (H1N2), the 2009 pandemic H1 virus (H1pdm) and the avian influenza virus-derived European porcine H1av virus. separate Bayesian analyses of each of these clusters unraveled distinct lineages within the H1pdm and H1av viruses cocirculating in swine in northwest Germany. clustering information is given by colored branches and/or by specific assignments to the right of the trees. the screened trees represent a PhyML analysis of an enlarged set of porcine subtype H1 sequences. at least four sublineages were distinguishable among recent H1av isolates from Germany. HA1 sequences of human-derived (hu) H1N2 porcine viruses recently detected in swine in germany appeared to form a nearly homogenous phylogenetic group. Isolate R1421/10 was an exception and clustered outside this group. no such regional patterns were observed in PhyML analyses of H1av or H1pdm sequences from central Europe. phylogenetic analysis in bayesian framework of neuraminidase genes of porcine influenza A viruses detected in selected swine herds in the northwest region of Germany, 2009 to 2011. no correlation of these NA sublineages with the H1av clustering of the respective isolates was found. only a few contemporary N2 porcine viruses from Germany segregated into porcine cluster 1. reassortants between the HA and NA of different viral subtypes were found for the H1 subtype only. one reassortant between H1N2 HA and H1N1av-derived NA N1 (N1av) was detected in 2009 (R3394/09) two reassortants, R369/09 and R1931/11, revealed HA protein sequences that were comparatively distant from the average H1av HA of contemporaneously circulating viruses. full-length genomes were established for 15 porcine isolates. for three additional isolates, one to two segments are missing. Isolates were selected so as to represent a cross section of subtypes, HA/NA reassortment patterns. a total of three genome constellations, or genogroups, were distinguishable. a pattern similar to those of other H1pdm viruses isolated from pigs in Europe and elsewhere. u D C E ND ND 1A 3 R2035/11 1pdm 2hu D C E A F3 1A 3 R495/2012 1pdm 2hu D C E A F3 1A 3 R325/2009 3 2 G1 F1 I1 F1 F1 1E-2 1 R494/2010 3 2 G1 F1 I1 F1 ND 1E-2 1 R2807/2009 3 2 G1 F1 I1 F1 ND 1 the majority of german isolates analyzed here (15 out of 18) encoded full-length (90-aa) PB1-F2. however, two isolates (R1737/09 and R2807/09) appeared to produce truncated forms of 79 aa and 87 aa. the length of NS1 was not correlated with HA/NA subtypes. the PDZ binding domain at the C terminus of full-length NS1 had the common sequence G-P-E-V (36) in the majority of isolates. the amantadine resistance markers S31N and R77Q in the M2 protein were observed in all the isolates analyzed here. reassortant H1avN2 isolate R1931/11 is distinguishable phylogenetically and, less pronouncedly, antigenically from other H1av isolates. the dendrogram to the right is based on phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of the HA1 proteins of the same viruses used in cross-reactive HI assays. two recent porcine isolates were selected for experimental infection studies with minipigs. Isolate R2035/11 (H1pdmN2) belonged to the group of reassortants between pandemic H1N1 and porcine HxN2 viruses. the infection of the contact pig confirms the presence of productive infection leading to rapid transmission of virus. clinical symptoms were similar to those of the R2035/11 group but were restricted to day 3 only. for unknown reasons, no clear-cut seroconversion was evident for the R2035 group. study B samples consisted of nasal swabs from sows, piglets, or weaners from large holdings with severe respiratory disease. a double infection with H1N1 and H3N2 was detected; both viruses were counted. .4% of samples tested positive for IAV RNA by RT-qPCR. year-round virus circulation independent of the season was observed. majority of sample submissions were either from sows or from weaners. only 15 submissions contained samples from sows and weaners. a total of 823 samples came from sows, of which 48 samples were influenza virus positive. the most significant factor appeared to be vaccination against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in sows, the most significant factor appeared to be vaccination against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (P = 0.002) reduced frequencies of influenza virus infections were also seen in weaners that had received circovirus (porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV-2]) vaccination. phylogenetic analysis in a Bayesian framework of the hemagglutinin gene HA1 fragments of porcine influenza A viruses detected in selected swine herds in the northwest region of Germany, 2009 to 2011. red dots on branches indicate sequences established in the frame of this study. Isolate R1856/11, at the tip of cluster 4, revealed substitutions V7I, T149S, A158I, G172K, L178I, K180T, and H288N (7 unique exchanges) further groups of isolates, as well as single isolates, with fewer unique mutation patterns were noticed. this was particularly for isolates positioned between clusters 1 and 2. phylogenetic diversity of porcine neuraminidase sequences from northwest Germany. clustering tendencies were also present in the NA phylogenetic trees. neuraminidase genes of porcine influenza A viruses detected in selected swine herds in the northwest region of Germany, 2009 to 2011. the neuraminidase of H1pdmN2 reassortants was analyzed. cluster 2 held most of the H1pdmN2 reassortant viruses. two reassortants whose HA1 sequences were conspicuously distinct from all other H1av sequences also fell into this cluster. reassortants between the HA of the H1N1av-derived H1 lineage and NA N2 of different lineages were detected in a total of four cases in 2009 (R369/09), 2011 (R1931/11 and R3508/11), and 2012 (R624/12). reassortants between the HA of the H1N1av-derived H1 lineage and NA N2 of different lineages were observed in a total of four cases. euraminidase sequences were assessed for mutations associated with decreased susceptibility, as confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. oseltamivir (H275Y and N295S in N1; R292K, E119V, and N294S in N2) and zanamivir (Q136K and K150T in N1; R292K and E119(A/D in N2] and (ii) for mutations observed during surveillance Isolates R369/09 and R1931/11 exhibited PB2 sequence patterns. R1931/11 also exhibited an NS sequence pattern. this confirms the separate clustering of these isolates in the phylogenetic trees of the \u201cinternal segments\u201d. v 2hu G2\" I2 F2 1E-2 2.1 R1931/2010 1av 2hu G2\" I2 F2\" 2 R299/2009 1hu 2hu G1 F1 I1 F1 F1 1E-2 1 R3394/09 1hu 1av G1 F1 I1 F1 1E-2 1 R757/2010 1hu 2hu G1 F1 I1 F1 1E-2 1 R856/2010 the majority of the 15 non-H1pdm isolates analyzed here are, independently of their glycoprotein subtypes, true representatives of the Eurasian avian influenza virus-derived cassette of \u201cinternal segments\u201d. the majority of german isolates analyzed here (15 out of 18) encoded full-length (90-aa) PB1-F2. the H1pdm viruses possess a stop codon at nucleotide 698, leading to a truncated PA-X protein (41 aa), whereas all other porcine IAVs should produce the full-length protein (61 aa) the remaining 6 viruses for which NS sequences were established displayed truncated NS1 proteins of 217 aa. assays using a set of postinfection sera established recently with swine and ferrets were transformed into a 2D antigenic map by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. the heat map shown in Fig. 4 was set at a similarity of 0.50 (50%) for the rows. the dendrogram to the right is based on phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of the HA1 proteins of the same viruses used in cross-reactive HI assays. a single homogenous group was found when these viruses were typed with serum raised against an older (Bakum/99) and a very recent (R655/12) H3N2 isolate. no differences were seen with regard to potential N-glycosylation sites (n = 8) Isolate R1931/11 represented a reassortant between an H1N1 virus of avian origin and a porcine HxN2 virus. this isolate showed several conspicuous genetic and phylogenetic features. the infection of the contact pig confirms the presence of productive infection leading to rapid transmission of virus. virologically detectable infection of older sows was a rare event (5.8% of samples were positive), yet circulating influenza virus was detected in the weaners of such holdings. however, short febrile episodes caused by limited and short-lived virus replication may have passed unnoticed. passive surveillance carried out in the frame of study B confirmed year-round viral activity for endemic porcine influenza viruses. this is in contrast to the seasonal pattern of human influenza in temperate zones. another study, which involved five european countries excluding Germany, also reported year-round influenza virus activity in swine herds. avian influenza virus-derived H1N1 lineage made up almost two-thirds of the fully subtyped samples. the dominance of H1av-like viruses is in line with earlier reports from Germany (6, 52) and other European countries (49) phylogenetic analyses of HA1 and NA sequences provided further insight into the diversity of cocirculating porcine influenza viruses. recent H1N2 and H3N2 HA1 sequences formed monophyletic clades that were temporally (H3N2) or geographically (H1N2) separated from their nearest neighbors in the trees. this seems to point toward transmission chains that do not cross political borders in the European Common Market. the origin of N2 sequences was assigned to four lineages. one lineage was derived from precursor viruses prevalent in the human population during the mid-1990s. no other porcine viruses carrying a neuraminidase have been described. three genogroups were distinguished in this study based on the limited number of 18 viruses that were fully sequenced. the only segment that showed reassortment, apart from HA and NA, was NS, in two cases. this finding is in line with recent analyses of Eurasian swine influenza virus sequences. a panel of polyclonal postinfection sera from swine and ferrets showed distinct antigenic properties. the normalized cross-reactive HI titer panel allows the classification of the standard subtype H1 viruses into avian influenza virus-derived H1av, pandemic H1pdm, and H1N2 viruses. in the H1av lineage, two antigenically distinct groups were evident. two viruses from lineages with conspicuous genetic, phylogenetic, and antigenic alterations from standard European subtypes were selected for infection experiments with minipigs. both the H1pdmN2 isolate R2035/11 and the aberrant H1avN2 reassortant R1931/11 replicated productively in pigs following intranasal inoculation and were readily transmitted to an in-contact sentinel. pigs were 13 weeks old when inoculated, and their increased age may explain the mild clinical signs. a region of northwestern Germany has 55% of the country's pig population. trend toward ongoing diversification at both the phylogenetic and antigenic levels were demonstrated."}
