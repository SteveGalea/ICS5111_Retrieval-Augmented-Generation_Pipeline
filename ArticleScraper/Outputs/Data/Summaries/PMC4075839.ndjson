{"summary": "HRCT scans were interpreted by two thoracic radiologists independently. most common findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidation (58%) other findings were airspace nodules (25%), bronchial wall thickening (25%), interlobular septal thickening (21%), crazy-paving pattern (15%), perilobular pattern (3%), and air trapping (3%). by October of 2012, approximately 20,000 patients had been hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome. the most common clinical findings in the presentation of H1N1 infection are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and headache. retrospective analysis of HRCT scans of 71 patients from several hospitals in different states in Brazil between July and September of 2009. the study population included patients presenting with flu-like symptoms and diagnosed with H1N1 infection, regardless of age or gender. a crazy-paving pattern was defined as interlobular septal thickening superimposed on ground-glass opacities. air trapping was defined as decreased attenuation of the lung parenchyma, revealed by a lower-than-usual density. the bronchial walls were considered thickened if the bronchial lumen internal internal. the distribution of the lesions in the lung parenchyma was evaluated along the axial and craniocaudal axes. the craniocaudal distribution of the lesions was classified as central or peripheral. results Of the 71 patients, 38 (53.53%) and 33 (46.47%) were female and male. Axial HRCT slices at the levels of the upper lobes (A) and lower lobes (B) revealing multiple small centrilobular nodules. note also bronchial wall thickening predominantly in the right lower lobe, as well as a small area of peripheral consolidation. air trapping was an uncommon finding, being observed in 2 patients. a perilobular pattern was found in only 2 patients (3%) a perilobular pattern was found in 19 patients (27%), being bilateral in 10 (52%). findings predominate in patients with H1N1 infection. bronchial wall thickening was observed in one fourth of the patients in our sample. a perilobular pattern is a finding that is commonly associated with organizing pneumonia. the most common distribution of HRCT findings is bilateral multifocal involvement predominantly in the lower lobes. in some studies, the distribution is diffuse, with no zonal predominance. pleural effusion, either unilateral or bilateral, has been described in some cases. pleural effusion was observed in 27% of the cases, being bilateral in 52% and typically minimal. no mediastinal lymphadenopathy was identified in any of the patients."}
