{"summary": "domain swapping is a special form of protein oligomerization. monomers exchange one or more identical structural elements to form complexes. this process acts as a mechanism for regulating protein function, and as an evolutionary strategy to create protein complexes. the unfolding mechanism for domain swapping predicts that the enthalpy barrier of domain swapping is two times that of the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the protein monomer. the results showed that domain swapping in all three systems are well described by the unfolding mechanism when the heat capacity difference between the native and denatured states is appropriately addressed. domain swapping occurs by the unfolding mechanism, i.e., swapping proceeds via complete unfolding, the process is subdivided as: (4) where ku and kf are the unfolding and folding rate constants, respectively. the equilibrium dissociation constant of the global domain swapping process is thus: (5) where K k/k and K k/k are the unfolding equilibrium constants for monomer and dimer, respectively. the kinetic barrier of domain swapping is two times the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the monomer and one time the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy change of the dimer. this provides a criterion for the unfolding mechanism of domain swapping which proceeds via complete unfolding. Liu et al.8 found that the swapping enthalpy barrier is very large and of similar magnitude to the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the monomer and dimer. however, although H H was verified, a relation of H H was observed in their work rather than the predicted H 2H presented in Eq. (10). the agreement between the experimental data and Eq. (2) is excellent. it can be seen from Figure 1 that the agreement between the experimental data and Eq. (2) is excellent even if only four parameters were used to globally fit six curves. we did not find the experimental results on Cp and Hu (Tm) in the literature. we used the fact16 of Gu (20\u00b0C) = 9.8 kcal/mol and the equation: (14) to estimate Cp to be 2.38 kcal/(molK) therefore, H at the swapping temperature (329 K) is determined to be 93.5 kcal/mol, and thus 2H = 187 kcal/mol. -NQ50 dimer is 50.2\u00b0C, which is close to the swapping temperature (325 K) of wt CV-N. we directly estimated the H of the wt CV-N dimer at the swapping temperature as the Hu (Tm) value (142 kcal/mol) of CV-N. we re-evaluated the folding/unfolding thermodynamics at the swapping temperature (37\u00b0C) to be: H = 270 kJ/mol and G = 23.3 kJ/mol. this value is comparable to the swapping H (374/436 kJ/mol) the wild-type is high-lighted by using an open circle. the solid line is a linear fit to the data. Kang et al. have also constructed various mutants of Mpro-C. a single active-site mutation on the oxidized form converts the protein into a biologically inactive domain-swapped dimer. the swapped dimer of Trx_W28Aox is a kinetically trapped species. it spontaneously refolds to the monomer after thermal unfolding. the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd = koff/kon is given. the time evolution of process (4) can be reduced into process (1). this is the main results for the unfolding mechanism of domain swapping. it relates the kinetics of domain swapping to the equilibrium of protein folding/unfolding. if swapping proceeds via partial unfolding, there would be no correlation between the swapping kinetics and the global protein stability. swapping via partial unfolding is still described by Eqs. (2,3) but the thermodynamics of partial unfolding should be used instead to relate to the swapping kinetics of domain swapping. the interconversion rate for swapping via partial unfolding should be faster and less sensitive to the temperature. wt CV-N domain-swapped dimer to the monomer using Eq. (2). enthalpy barrier H extracted from our fitting is very close to that derived from the single exponential fitting (145/153 kcal/mol). we found that the answer lies in the large heat capacity difference (Cp) between the denatured and native proteins. the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy (H) was usually measured from thermal melting curves so that its value is applicable near the melting temperature (Tm) the domain swapping kinetics was measured at lower temperatures, where the corresponding H should be lower than that at Tm. we have 2H = 126 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the observed H value (145/153 kcal/mol) for the dimer. however, for dimers which are less stable than monomers, their unfolding is usually coupled with a dimer-monomer transition. Kang et al.9 recently measured the swapping kinetics and the folding/unfolding thermodynamics. k calculated from Eq. (6) greatly exceeds the typical protein association rate constants. k for the mutants falls in the range of 1.0\u201316.9 105 M1 s1 (Supporting Information Table S1), the majority of which are close to that for the wide-type. despite some fluctuations, there is a tight correlation between kon and Tm. the state is not well established, so the physicochemical meaning of the parameters such as k may depend on the system. if swapping proceeds via partial unfolding, then U*U should be composed of partially unfolded monomers. there does not exist a tight correlation between the swapping kinetics and the global protein stability for swapping proceeds via partial unfolding. the swapping kinetics was extracted from the temperature dependence of the apparent excess heat capacity in Garcia-Pino et al.,21. this H value is very similar to the measured swapping kinetic barrier H (120 kcal/mol), suggesting the unfolding mechanism to be responsible for the domain swapping of Trx_W28Aox. results suggest that the domain swapping of CV-N, Mpro-C, and Trx_W28Aox is dominated by the unfolding mechanism. additional supporting information may be found in this article."}
