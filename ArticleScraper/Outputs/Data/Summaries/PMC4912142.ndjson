{"summary": "more than 530,000 babies, approximately 12% of total births, are born before 37 full weeks of gestation. neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is seen as the abrupt development of bloody diarrhea, abdominal swelling, and tenderness in a premature infant. current treatment often requires surgical removal of the damaged and dead intestine, often resulting in mortality (about 40%) exogenous infusion of EGF in utero has been shown to accelerate intestinal maturation as well as stimulate intestinal growth [16,17] the importance of EGF to gut development is highlighted by the fact that knockout of the EGF receptor in some mice results in death due to a bloody diarrhea that is similar to human NEC. the need and potential delivery makes infant formula a good model for food-sourced plant biotechnology. soybean milk and derived products are a potential food-therapy delivery platform that could include medically-necessary products including drugs such as EGF. plasmid pGLY::ShEGF was sequenced using a glycinin promoter primer (5\u2019 TCATTCACCTTTCTCTCTTC 3\u2019) to ensure the EGF open reading frame was placed correctly between the regulatory elements. embryos from resistant lines were analyzed by genomic PCR to confirm the presence of inserted hygromycin cassette. acetone washes followed by acetone precipitation with the protein pellet dissolved in water. a 15% SDS-PAGE gel was used to separate 30 g protein for each of the three samples. the presence of the EGF protein was detected by using a color substrate. EGF quantification Total soluble protein was extracted from 7 lines of pGLY::ShEGF transgenic plants. non-transgenic seeds were used as a negative control. each homozygote EGF transgenic line was assayed with three biological replicates. precipitated proteins were pelleted using centrifugation, washed twice with acetone and then dried using vacuum centrifugation. the commercial EGF was not filtered or precipitated, only dried. samples were then alkylated with addition of 10 l iodacetamide. a potential of 2100 volts was applied using a liquid junction between the column and emitter. a mass spectrometer was used to analyze the eluate from the U3000. a mass spectrometer was used to analyze the eluate from the U3000. the protein fasta database for Glycine max was downloaded from NCBI RefSeq on august 5, 2015. the protein fasta database was concatenated to the original as a way to assess dataset quality. cells were grown on coverslip in 6-well plate and kept in serum free media. cells were then either kept in serum free media (control) or stimulated with human or soy EGF for 6 hours. EGFR was labeled using anti-EGFR antibody (#4267, cell signaling technology) embryos were transformed via biolistics using 30 mg/L hygromycin B selection and regenerated as previously described. Embryos from resistant lines were analyzed by genomic PCR to confirm the presence of inserted hygromycin cassette using primers specific to the hygromycin gene. dry seeds from two successive generations of PCR positive plants were analyzed by ELISA. a 15% SDS-PAGE gel was used to separate 30 g protein for each sample. commercially available human EGF (Gibco, Life Technologies,United Kingdom) was used at 0.5 g as positive control. the provided positive control was used to create a standard curve in order to determine the amount of EGF in each soybean protein extract. each homozygote EGF transgenic line was assayed with three biological replicates and results displayed as mean +/- standard error. addition of 10 l 100 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. samples were then alkylated with addition of 10 l iodacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bromide. post trypsin digest samples were desalted using a peptide reverse phase microtrap. mass spectra were converted to MGF format using MSConvert. precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set to 0.2 Daltons for OMSSA and X!tandem. cell culture, Western Blotting and Immunocytochemistry Hela cells were cultured in minimum essential media (MEM) for western blotting assay, cells grown in 6-well plate were kept in serum free media (control) or stimulated with human or soy EGF for different time period as indicated. EGFR was labeled using anti-EGFR antibody (#4267, cell signaling technology) the cell nucleus were shown using mounting medium with DAPI (#H-1200, Vectorshield) results Recombinant hEGF is expressed in both cotyledonary-stage embryos regenerated in primary transformation events and then in homozygous soybean seeds. each generation of seeds produced by the selected lines was assayed for hEGF content by ELISA. the lines varied in hEGF content but seeds within each line had a narrow range of hEGF accumulation. by comparison, yeast stains have been used as an expression system for both human and mouse EGF. soluble low molecular weight (10 kDa) seed proteins and the Mr of the soybean-produced hEGF were evaluated. the total protein polypeptide of the hEGF expressing lines appeared to be identical to the standard parental control (Fig 2). protein extracts from two independent homozygous lines are compared to both nontransgenic (Wt) and commercially available EGF standard (STD +) EGF was detected using an EGF specific antibody and indirect secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. the binding of rhEGF to EGFR results in the decrease of displayed EGFR as it is internalized into the HeLa cells. parallel time-course experiments show that the effect of rhEGF binding to EFGR is rapid with a reduction of displayed EFGR occurring within 5 min of treatment. together these assays show that soymilk has no apparent negative bioactivity. hEGF induces an internalization and degradation of EGFR in Hela cells. the rhEGF is not degraded in soymilk over 24 hours having the same bioactivity as control rhEGF. soybeans producing hEGF have identical activity in comparison to commercial rhEGF. ideally a consumption plant biotechnology platform should be fully equivalent to the standard type other than the intended modification. increase sulfur content be either modifying assimilation and biosynthesis pathways leading to methionine or over-expressing high-methionine proteins such as maize zeins. EGF is a high sulfur content protein that broadly mimics BBI as a small globular protein synthesized by the ER and presumptively competing for sulfur amino acid charge tRNA. a synthetic soybean codon optimized hEGF (ShEGF) gene included an N-terminal 60 nucleotide ER-signal sequence. to facilitate the co-translational transfer of the EGF into the ER lumen for disulfide bond formation a plant signal sequence was added so that the hEGF synthesized would be as a pre-hEGF. the hEGF synthesized would be as a pre-hEGF. the highest levels produced were from a multicopy insert Pichia pastoris clone secreting 49 g EGF/ml. in both the mouse and human EGF production systems, truncated versions of the EGF were detected. the crude low Mr proteins were reduced, alkylated, and cleaved with trypsin. resulting data was queried with the hEGF sequence and exact matches for peptides encompassing the majority of the sequence of the complete mature hEGF protein were obtained. commercial recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) was added as a supplement to soymilk. the intrinsic activity of the EGF was tested with a HeLa cell assay. soymilk does not modify the display of EGFR on Hela cells. soybean produced hEGF induces a rapid phosphorylation of Hela cell EGFR. serum free media (SF) and SF media with soymilk alone does not induce EGFR phosphorylation and degradation. the cells were treated with soy/EGF or human EGF for 6 hours. EGFR shows red staining while nucleus was stained by DAPI. samples were prepared from both ShEGF transgenic soybean lines and nontransgenic controls that were used to stimulate HeLa cells. hEGF transgenic and nontransgenic control soybeans were analyzed by non-targeted proteomics and metabolomics. there was no significant difference between nontransgenic and hEGF transgenic soybeans aside from the targeted production of hEGF for any other proteins of concern. a complete dataset of all metabolite abundance of standard and hEGF-expressing lines is available as an on-line spreadsheet. hEGF levels were determined to be the same in both the nontransgenic and hEGF-expressing soybean lines. the expression of hEGF in soybeans does not produce any incidental collateral consequences of concern for its potential therapeutic use. soybean is an industrial crop with vast majority of its total production being directed towards products including processed food, protein used as animal feed, and its oil for food, feed, fuel, and chemical feedstock uses. soybean seeds can be stored for years anticipating future needs while retaining the potential to be rapidly processed into formula/milk or tofu. a mutant inactive BBI was expressed in transgenic soybeans. hEGF appears to be completely comparable to authentic hEGF. the hEGF from these seeds are bioactive for EGF activity in a model. the non-targeted metabolomics of the soybean seeds showed a significant lack of alteration of the small molecule profile in response to hEGF accumulation. in the heLa cell assessments there was no synergistic effect of standard soybean milk and authentic EGF on EGFR activity. human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) has been produced in soybeans to address the disease of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis. this is a disease of premature infants of low birth weight. the resulting gangrenous infection is treated by emergency surgery to remove dead portions of the intestinal tract. soybean is a potentially useful biopharma platform that could have broad application in both food and feed end uses [29, 30, 56, 57]. soybeans can be used to produce both soymilk and formula for potential delivery to human infants or children as well as for production animals such as swine and calves. soybean seeds are optimized as a potential bioreactor to produce and store proteins like EGF, a 6.9 kDa protein with 3 intra chain disulfide bonds paralleling intrinsic seed proteins. hEGF appears to be completely comparable to authentic hEGF in its Mr, immunoreactivity with specific antibodies, correspondence of fragment sequence in mass spectrometry assay, and in bioactivity. non-targeted metabolomics of the soybean seeds showed a significant lack of alteration of the small molecule profile in response to hEGF accumulation. the lack of change in Genistein is among the most significant as this isoflavonoid has been shown to have activity with tyrosine phosphatase. human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) has been produced in soybeans to address the disease of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis. this is a disease of premature infants of low birth weight. this is a disease of premature infants of low birth weight."}
