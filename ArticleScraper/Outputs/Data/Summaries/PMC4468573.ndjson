{"summary": "measles-related tweets, other social media messages, and online newspaper articles over a 7-month period. thematic analysis was used to structure and analyze the topics. results There was a stronger correlation between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of reported measles cases. vaccination coverage among children up to age 4 years is high in the Netherlands. vaccination coverage among children up to age 4 years is high in the Netherlands. in the Netherlands, the national Immunization Program offers childhood vaccinations free of charge. RIVM was asked for weekly updates of reported measles cases. some well-known politicians made public statements, such as \"parents should take their responsibility and vaccinate their children\" the measles outbreak was highly publicized, the number of social media messages will show stronger convergence with the number of traditional media messages than with the epidemic curve (number of reported cases). a second goal of this research was to analyze the content and specific sentiments expressed on Twitter, other social media, and online newspapers to detect factors that might influence vaccination behavior. articles from online newspapers were retrieved via LexisNexis and HowardsHome. tweets were retrieved via Twiqs.nl and HowardsHome. messages from other social media were also retrieved from HowardsHome. a measles case could be defined if the reported case did not meet the clinical and laboratory criteria but met the epidemiological criteria. a measles case could also be defined if the reported case did not meet the clinical and laboratory criteria but met the epidemiological criteria. infrequently used (sub) topics were collapsed into larger (main) topics (n=8) examples from tweets, other social media, and online newspapers about the measles outbreak or perceived risks. the sentiments for online newspaper articles differed from the sentiments in tweets and other social media messages. the sentiments for tweets and other social media messages were based on the classification used by Vasterman & Ruigrok [23], which included the following 3 sentiments: alarming (eg, \u201cTeenager dead by measles infection\u201d), neutral / no sentiment. arcasm, concern, relief, question, minimized risk, information, and personal experiences. if the message contained more than one sentiment, the first identified was chosen. Table 2 shows examples of tweets and other social media messages. personal experience Tweet/message contains a personal experience/story about the disease without expressing any concerns. information not related to measles outbreak Tweet has nothing to do with the measles outbreak or a relation with the measles outbreak could not be found. topics and sentiments were coded for all measles-related online newspaper articles found (n=351) of the 282 articles, 79 were published in the 2 religious-oriented newspapers and 203 were published in the 7 nonreligious-oriented newspapers. each message was coded independently by 2 raters to establish coding reliability. data were gathered from April 15, 2013 (ie, 15 days before the start of the measles outbreak) to November 11, 2013 (ie, 14 days after the report of the measles-related death on October 28, 2013). social media included messages from websites such as forums, weblogs, Facebook, and other social media. a measles case could also be defined if the reported case did not meet the clinical and laboratory criteria but met the epidemiological criteria. a measles case could also be defined if the reported case did not meet the clinical and laboratory criteria. thematic analysis was performed [22] to identify the topics. the process of coding and the development of themes were inductive. thematic analysis was performed. public perceives risks of measles disease and measles vaccine. measles prevention (including additional vaccinations, maternal measles antibodies, obligatory vaccination, vaccinating secretly, vaccinating employees, vaccinating religious people) no trust in information supply, should government interfere in whether people should vaccinate or not. the sentiments for tweets and other social media messages were based on the article by Chew & Eysenbach [14]. the sentiments included frustration, humor/sarcasm, concern, relief, question, minimized risk, information, and personal experiences. Tweet/message minimizes the risk of measles infection and/or possible complications. Information Tweet/message contains information, informative retweets, and/or other information sources about measles. the number of tweets not related to the measles outbreak was 38 of 2020. retweets were coded for all measles-related online newspaper articles found (n=351) of the 282 articles, 79 were published in the 2 religious-oriented newspapers and 203 were published in the 7 nonreligious-oriented newspapers. for tweets, the kappas for sentiment and topic were.79 and.77 respectively. for other social media, the kappas for sentiment and topic were.58 and.81 respectively. for online newspapers, the kappas for sentiment and topic were.80 and.81, respectively. a significant increase was shown in the number of measles cases. in the same period, the number of media messages continued to gradually decrease. in the same period, the number of measles cases decreased. measles vaccine and refusing vaccination because of religious reasons were also frequently reported topics. but did not significantly differ from other topics, such as opinions of those who are critical toward vaccination and the trust and role of institutions. most articles in religious- and nonreligious-oriented newspapers were about the measles outbreak and measles prevention. the percentages of the topics did not differ significantly between the religious- and nonreligious-oriented newspapers. sentiments relating to humor/sarcasm and \u201cother\u201d were hardly expressed in the tweets and other social media messages. Sentiments relating to concern, question, minimized risk, relief, and personal experience were hardly expressed in the tweets and other social media messages. 0.6-2.4 27 (5.8) 3.9-8.2 58 (2.37) 1.82-3.03 Personal experience 12 (0.88) 0.48-1.50 1 (0.2) 0.0-0.8 19 (4.1) 2.6-6.2 32 (1.31) 0.91-1.82 Relief 12 (0.88) 0.48-1.50 8 (1.3) 0.6-2.4 6 (1.3) 0.5-2.7 26 (1.06) 0.71-1.53 We also analyzed how content was expressed in online news articles. media messages with topics relating to measles incidence or measles prevention were informative for measles outbreak and 35.6% (47/132) for measles prevention. 48% (16/33) of messages with the topic measles outbreak were related to sentiment of frustration. 30% (27/90) of messages qualified as minimized risk. 3 large peaks in the number of messages with a small width were observed for all 3 types of online media data. the first peak in mid-June coincided with the announcement of the start of the measles outbreak. the second peak corresponded with the announcement that additional control measures were to be implemented. the third peak coincided with the announcement that an unvaccinated adolescent had died due to measles complications. in the same period, the number of measles cases decreased. table 3 shows a stronger convergence between the number of social media messages and the number of news messages. most tweets and online news articles were about the measles outbreak. 2 n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI Measles outbreak 56 (41.2) 33.1-49.6 14 (23) 14-35 95 (20.5) 17.0-24.3 150 (53.2) 47.3-59.0 315 (33.4) 30.5-36.5 Measles prevention 23 (16.9) 11.3-23.9 17 (28) 18-41 n=203 Total N=282 n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI Measles outbreak 35 (44) 34-55 115 (56.7) 49.8-63.3 150 (53.2) 47.3-59.0 Measles prevention 24 (30) 21-41 52 (25.6) 20.0-32.0 76 (27.0) 22.0-32.4 Critical toward vaccination 5 (6) 2-13 11 (5.4) 2.9-9.2 16 (5.3) 3.1-8.4 Perceived 1356 Retweets n=626 Other social media n=464 Total N=2446 n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI n (%) 95% CI Information 667 (49.19) 46.53-51.85 214 (34.2) 30.5-38.0 82 (17.7) 14.4-21.3 963 (39.37) 37.45-41.32 Frust measles-related articles in religious newspapers were more neutral, less alarming, and more reassuring than articles in nonreligious newspapers. the number of neutral and alarming articles was significantly higher than the number of reassuring articles in religious- and nonreligious newspapers. of the other social media messages with the topic of perceived risk, we found that 30% (27/90) of messages qualified as minimized risk. 22% (20/90) as concern (ie, in combination with the subtopic of measles disease is not severe), and 19% (17/90) as neutral (ie, in combination with the subtopics of adverse events and perceived effectiveness of vaccine) social media attention shows a steep drop after the second peak, whereas the number of reported measles cases remained relatively high. this suggests that the news value of the measles outbreak had dropped and other topics gained prominence. most tweets were about the measles outbreak and were informative. most newspaper articles were about the measles outbreak and were neutral or alarming. no significant differences were found between religious- and nonreligious-oriented newspapers. the study of Chew & Eysenbach analyzed tweets related to an unknown disease and vaccine. the outbreak mostly affected unvaccinated Orthodox Protestants. this study did not provide new insights into factors possibly related to intention to vaccination and/or vaccination behavior. the biggest advantage of using online data is the continuous data collection and the user-generated content. despite these limitations, the biggest advantage of using online data is the continuous data collection and the user-generated content. online (social) media monitoring generates continuous data and consists of user-generated content. this study addressed various specific topics about a measles outbreak among Orthodox Protestants. a next step is to explore the public\u2019s opinion about other NIP diseases using similar methodology. data provide insight into the opinions of the public about infectious diseases outbreaks. findings support the agenda-setting function of the media. social media attention shows a steep drop after the second peak. vasterman & Ruigrok [23] argued that this was probably because almost 50% of the hospitalized patients were children, which made this extra newsworthy. findings point to the importance of differentiating between illnesses; for some illnesses, social media may reflect outbreak patterns. senbach [14] showed that tweets primarily contained news, updates, and information about the outbreak. this was less the case (experiencing measles is a subtopic within the topic measles outbreak) tweets expressing humor, concern, and questions were the most common. 90% of the Dutch population aged 12 years and older use the internet. of those, 70% are active on social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter. this may not be the case for those writing about measles on social media. europe's joint research centre has developed a number of news aggregation and analysis systems (EMM) to support EU institutions and Member State organizations with analyzing real-time news for medical- and health-related topics and providing early warning alerts per category and country. the advantage of this EMM is that it is already an automated process and that it covers many languages, including Dutch. the number of tweets, other social media messages, and online newspaper articles showed a similar distribution over time with 3 large peaks. most messages were about informing people about the measles outbreak and the leading sentiment was frustration regarding people who do not vaccinate for religious reasons."}
