{"summary": "eight species of EEHV, including EEHV1A, EEHV1B, and EEHV2-7, have been identified. mortality from EEHV-HD has mostly been observed in young animals. monocytes/macrophages play a crucial role in the host defense mechanism against pathogen infections and dissemination. dengue virus in vitro increased apoptosis of virus-infected cells. apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages in dengue virus infection is believed to be an immunological process that inhibits virus replication in infected patients. no studies have investigated apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages in cases of EEHV infection. elephants that died due to co-infection of EEHV1A and 4-HD were also included in the study. the details of each animal\u2019s history and the tests performed are shown in Table 1. 1A and 4 NA NA NA 11 NA M Deceased Negative NA NA NA 12 [6,7] 1-d M Deceased Negative NA NA 13 35-y M Deceased Negative NA NA 14 5-y M Alive Negative NA NA 15 8-y M Alive Negative NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA. the tissues were grouped by EEHV status those from elephants that died from EEHV1A. sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and microwaved for 30 minutes in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) sections were incubated for 5 minutes with 3%H2O2 in methanol, then blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Tween-20. after washing three times with PBS, sections were incubated for 45 minutes at RT with either biotiny the percentage of positive cells was recorded for every tissue sample. PBMCs were isolated from the persistent EEHV4-infected (n = 2) and EEHV-negative (n = 2) calves. the FFPE samples were investigated for apoptosis using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. the assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection kit. slides were washed with PBS twice and microwaved for 2 minutes. primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-EEHV gB (1:500), and mouse monoclonal anti-Iba-1 (1:400; Millipore Corporation) secondary antibodies were incubated for 45 minutes at RT with a mixture of the Cy3\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. the cultures were analyzed and photos were taken under an inverted fluorescent microscope. the total RNA of PBMCs obtained from the persistent EEHV4-infected and EEHV-negative calves was extracted and determined using nucleospin\u00ae RNA II. the cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng total RNA with random primers and high capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kits. gB-positive cells and those of Iba-1-positive cells from the hearts, lungs, lymph nodes, intestines and salivary glands of calves from the EEHV1A-HD, EEHV4-HD and co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD groups were analyzed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test. statistical significance was designated as p 0.05. animal no.

EEHV1A-HD (r = -0.36) and co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD (r = -0.35) calves. no significant correlation was identified in the EEHV4-HD calves. results suggest that Iba-1 positive monocytes infiltrated the inflamed tissues of the internal organs. no significant correlation was observed in the EEHV4-HD calves. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells were high, up to 30% of the nucleated cells, in the EEHV1A-HD cases compared to the EEHV-negative control. TUNEL assay revealed remarkable and significant apoptosis in the EEHV-HD calves. EEHV1A-HD calves predominantly seen in mononuclear cells within the blood vessels compared to the EEHV-negative control group. PBMCs were obtained from healthy elephants known to be infected with EEHV4 for at least six months. PBMCs were either double immunofluorescent stained with anti-EEHV gB and anti-Iba-1 antibodies (A) or processed for transmission electron microscopy (B) IL-4, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 genes in the persistent EEHV4-infected calves were non-significant, compared to the EEHV-negative control group. cytokine mRNA expressions of elephant PBMCs revealed significant up-regulations of TNF- and IFN- in the persistent EEHV4-infected calves. eosinophil count (cells/L) 1,353.7 2,132.5 2,000\u20134,000 Mean basophil count (cells/L) 32.7 105.5 100\u20131,000 Mean basophil count (cells/L) - rare eosinophil count (cells/L) - rare eosinophil count (cells/L) immunohistochemical labeling for Iba-1 of tissue samples. EEHV infections resulted in a non-suppurative and granulomatous vasculitis and perivasculitis. increased extravasation of the Iba-1 positive cells out of blood vessels of the EEHV-HD calves. Iba-1 antibodies were observed within the blood vessels and parenchymal tissues of various internal organs of EEHV-infected calves. EEHV gB-positive cells and Iba-1-positive cells in the elephant tissues of EEHV1A-HD, EEHV4-HD, and co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD calves. no significant correlation was identified in EEHV4-HD calves. EEHV4 gB immunolabeling positive cells in EEHV4-HD calves also increased. correlative scoring of EEHV gB and Iba-1 antibodies from the hearts, lungs, livers, lymph nodes, kidneys, salivary glands, and intestines were scored by three independent observers. TUNEL positive cells were high, up to 30% of the nucleated cells, in the EEHV1A-HD cases compared to the EEHV-negative control (C). the increase in apoptotic cells in the EEHV1A-HD cases was mainly observed in the mononuclear cells in the blood vessels. blood obtained from elephants with previous history of EEHV4 DNAemia was analyzed by double immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. most EEHV gB positive cells were also positive for Iba-1 immunolabeling. EEHV4 infection in elephant monocytes was non-productive and caused moderate degeneration of the infected cells. transmission electron micrographs of the EEHV4-positive elephant monocytes revealed segmented nuclei and variable degrees of vacuolation in the cytoplasm. some endosomes containing virus particles were observed through chromatin and cytoplasmic lysis. cytokine mRNA expression in the persistent EEHV4-infected and EEHV-negative elephant PBMCs revealed significant up-regulations of TNF- and IFN- mRNA a sudden reduction of monocytes in blood circulation, known as monocytopenia, is one of the prognostic hematological parameters of EEHV-HD. despite some studies observing EEHV genomes and antigens in monocytes/macrophages, the exact roles the monocytes/macrophages play in cases of either acute infection and subsequent fatality or persistent EEHV-infection are unclear. viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), infect monocytes/macrophages and cause their necrosis and apoptosis. apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death characterized by decreased nuclear and cellular volume, nuclear fragmentation, and plasma membrane blebbing. there can be substantial crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, triggered in totic proteins, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma-1 (Bcl-1), as causes delay apoptosis in the infected cells. the delay apoptosis of HCMV-infected monocytes allow these cells to bridge the 48\u201372 hours viability gate. apoptosis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells was predominantly observed in the fatal cases of EEHV TNF- related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to contribute to the induction of apoptosis in several types of tumor or virus-infected cells. this study showed that TNF- mRNA up-regulated in the persistent EEHV4-infected calves suggesting that during EEHV infection, TNF- not only contributed to apoptosis of the EEHV-infected cells, but also EEHV circulates in the blood stream by infecting monocytes. it gets into the target organs by infecting or transmigrating through vascular endothelia. studies have shown that type 1 interferon may play a role in inhibiting reactivation of EEHV during persistent EEHV infections in humans and animal models. apoptosis may cause monocytopenia in the cases of acute or persistent EEHV infection in Asian elephants. immunolabeling of Iba-1 antibodies was observed in various internal organs of EEHV4-HD calves compared to the EEHV-negative control group (A, B) no significance of the TUNEL positive cells was observed in the EEHV4-infected elephant PBMCs."}
