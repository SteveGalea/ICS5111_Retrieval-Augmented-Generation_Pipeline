{"summary": "global sales of herbal products will reach up to 107 billion US dollar by 2017. in china, 9,854 cases of adverse drug reactions were reported in 2002 alone. manufacturers are often tempted to increase profits by incorrectly labeling their herbal products. processed materials of the relatively rare herbaceous perennial Panax ginseng C. A. Mey are commonly adulterated with materials from the low-cost herb Panax quinquefolius (Chen et al., 2008). contamination is also a repeated problem due to lack of quality control. methods that involve molecular biological techniques, such as amplified fragment length polymorphism (Percifield et al., 2008; Bandyopadhyay and Raychaudhuri, 2012), DNA microarray (Zhang et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2012), DNA barcoding (Chen et al., 2010; Mahadani and Ghosh, 2013; Pang et al., 2015); and high resolution nucleic acid amplification is an indispensable process in all living organisms. the process enables production of genetic copies to be passed onto the next generations for maintaining life. amplification techniques can be categorized into two groups, non-isothermal nucleic acid amplification and isothermal nucleic acid amplification. isothermal amplification assays offer high sensitivity and specificity when compared with the PCR-based methods. this excellent characteristic has prompted the commercialization of some isothermal amplification technologies for rapid detection purposes. it is well-established and widely applied, with more than a thousand scientific articles concerning its application. LAMP is one of the fastest amplification techniques that can be readily adapted for use in developing countries where there is a lack of infrastructure to support PCR facilities. since its emergence, LAMP has been used for the detection of various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoans. LAMP analysis is able to detect a single copy of bacteria in specimen and media samples. a reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) combined with enzyme linked immunosorbent hybridization assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplified from a single copy per reaction to detectable product in sputum samples. similar sensitivity accompanying specificity has been observed in HIV and malaria detection. LAMP analysis is suitable for genetically modified organism (GMO) screening and detection (Li et al., 2015). in this case, the LAMP targets can be commonly employed promoters (such as P-35S; Fukuta et al., 2004), specific genes (such as cry1Ac; Zhou et al., 2014), marker genes (such as nptII; Randhawa et al., 2013), and specific transgenic event (GM LAMP is a revolutionary DNA amplification method based on strand displacement reaction and a stem-loop structure under isothermal condition. it uses the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase and a set of four to six specifically designed primers that hybridize to six or eight different parts of the target DNA sequence. the amount of DNA produced in LAMP is considerably higher than that produced in PCR-based amplification. the development of the number of publications involving the use of LAMP showed a multiplied nearly exponentially. in studies to detect any Plasmodium species in blood, or in faecal samples, they also have been verified the differentiation of the main Plasmodium species of human malaria. bacterial pathogens are the main biological hazard in food safety. traditional culture-based methods require testing the pathogenic microorganisms. in some cases, culture-based methods may very well fail to detect a contamination properly due to the absence of viable cells. the detection limiting rate of this method was 0.01%. Zhang et al. (2013) developed a simple DNA extraction device with modified visual LAMP for the on-site detection of GMOs. RAPD sequence Chaudhary et al., 2012 Identification of the herbal tea ingredient Taraxacum formosanum ITS2 of the rRNA gene Lai et al., 2015 Verification of the authenticity of Aristolochia manshuriensis ITS2 of the rRNA gene Zhao et al., 2016 Sasaki and Nagumo (2007) developed a LAMP-based method targeting trnK gene sequences to verify the identity of Curcum only three nucleotide differences exist in the 18S rRNA gene sequences of P. ginseng and P. japonicus. similar method was devoted to the identification of traditional Chinese medicine Cordyceps sinensis (dong chong xia cao) ITS2 contains barcode information for their adulterants, substitutes and closely related species. it also contains barcode information for their adulterants, substitutes and closely related species. the authors provided a practical SOP for utilizing the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication. the women developed renal interstitial fibrosis and upper tract urothelial carcinomas-aristolochic acid nephropathy. the main reason for this occurrence is the incorrect substitution of adulterants, such as germander (Teucrium chamaedrys) instead of skullcap. the identity of Aristolochia manshuriensis in processed commercial herbal products can be verified as low as 1%. if the result indicates that the species is different from the anticipated species, then the former may be an accidental or intentional substitute that may or may not be harmful. the use of that sample (andpresumably its entire batch) can be avoided. at least three duplicate collections per species should be used. each collection (uniquely numbered) must include a small plant sample for DNA extraction. the samples must be in good condition (e.g., devoid of contamination) primer design is similar to that of PCR, but significant differences exist between the two approaches. if target sequences are AT rich, then the LAMP primers should be designed with Tm > 55\u00b0C, length (18\u201325 nt) and GC content 45%. primers can be designed to produce a resultant amplicon size of 300 bp. but long amplicons can result in poor sensitivity and reaction times. the end of the primers serves as the starting point of the DNA synthesis and must thus have a certain degree of stability. the length of F1c/B1c is 18\u201323 bp, whereas the lengths of F2/B2 and F3/B3 are 18\u201322 bp. the melting temperature should be adjusted to the appropriate range according to the characteristic of the amplified products. the distance between F2 and B2 is 50\u2013150 bp. LAMP analysis is suitable for the identification of Curcuma longa and C. aromatica trnK chloroplast region Sasaki and Nagumo. they found that LAMP analysis is suitable for the identification of these two easily confused species. this is the first report on the utilization of the LAMP approach in rapid discrimination of herbal plants. a similar method was devoted to the identification of traditional Chinese medicine Cordyceps sinensis (dong chong xia cao) and its adulterants C. hawresii, C. ramosa, C. liangschanensis, C. militaris and C. barnesi. this Medicinal plants DNA barcode database accepts all nuclear ITS and plastid DNA regions results for medicinal plants. the database includes almost all crude herbal drugs listed in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Korean Pharmacopoeia, Indian Pharmacopeia, United States Pharmacopeia, and European Pharmacopoeia. traditional herbal medicines that are adulterated and/or contaminated with toxic plant materials have caused a number of major epidemic events. traditional herbal medicines that are adulterated and/or contaminated with toxic plant materials have caused major epidemic events. Lonicera japonica could be mislabeled as an adulterant in commercial L. japonica products due to their similar appearance. trnL\u2013trnF amplicons is suitable to design species-specific primers for identification of G. elegans. the need for an immediate identification method is urgent in the herbal medicine market. a proposed SOP for herbal medicine identification involves sample collection, verification of voucher herbarium specimens, DNA extraction, candidate DNA region sequencing, species-specific LAMP primer design, LAMP amplification. high-quality DNA samples can be obtained by using the modified CTAB method. high levels of polysaccharides and polyphenols in herbal materials must be removed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and -mercaptoethanol during the early stages of DNA extraction. for DNA extraction, dosage of plant starting material, PVP, and -mercaptoethanol must be increased accordingly. the primer design conditions for a normal sequence (45% GC 60%) are inputted as a default setting. if the target sequences are GC rich (GC content > 60%), then the LAMP primers (F3 and B3) should be designed with Tm > 55\u00b0C, length (18\u201325 nt), and GC content > 60%. primer sets can be designed with Primer Explorer, which is specifically for LAMP2. the length of F1c/B1c is 18\u201323 bp, whereas the length of F2/B2 and F3/B3 is 18\u201322 bp. the melting temperature should be adjusted to the appropriate range according to the characteristic of the amplified products. Species identification is accomplished by analyzing the turbidity curve in combination with visual color change instead of using only the DNA electrophoresis test. to prevent such results, the use of low-melting point paraffin wax to reduce the probability of contamination is recommended. the high levels of polysaccharides and polyphenols in some herbal materials must be removed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and -mercaptoethanol during the early stages of DNA extraction. for DNA extraction, the dosage of plant starting material, PVP, and -mercaptoethanol must be increased accordingly. the loop primers should be designed with Tm > 55\u00b0C, length (15\u201325 nt) and GC content > 60%. the loop primers can be designed based on the primer information file of the regular primer set. the loop primers can dramatically reduce the amplification time but are not the essential requirement for LAMP. this software has special characteristics to design and shortlist four superior LAMP primer sets, followed by checking the GC content, stability at the end of each primer, and other key parameters. the melting temperature for F1c/B1c is 60\u201365\u00b0C, whereas the Tm for F2/B2 and F3/B3 is 58\u201361\u00b0C. use of low-melting point paraffin wax to reduce the probability of contamination is recommended. many emerging technologies (including chemical and molecular) have been used in herbal medicine identification. but their application is still limited partly due to the infrastructures require in the laboratory and skills require well-trained experts. despite its proven effectiveness, the application of LAMP method is still in the initial stage. additional extensive studies are required to exploit and establish a primers database for LAMP as a reliable detection tool in herbal medicine identification. a correlation was found between the turbidity level and the amount of target object in the mixture. a linear regression analysis was just established in spite of the fact that an optical evaluation of the data points hardly justifies. some critical discussion of key issues, e.g., influences of sample contamination and matrix effects on the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods, is missing."}
