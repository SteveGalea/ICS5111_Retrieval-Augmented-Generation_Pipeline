{"summary": "the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. however, the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. FCoV consist of two biotypes; Feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) which is highly fatal and caused immune mediated complex. feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) which caused from asymptomatic infection to severe enteritis. the initial CPE was recorded at 2\u20133 days PI. as the virus passages reach the third passages, the onset of CPE appeared within 24 hours PI and completed within 36\u201348 hours PI. infected cells become rounded, granular and clumped forming syncytial cells. infected cells become rounded, granular and clumped forming syncytial cells. syncytial cells were observed to contain between 20\u201330 nuclei per cell at 36\u201348 hours PI. differentiation of FCoV using specific primer sets for type I and type II FCoV yielded an expected amplification product of 275 bp and 232 bp denoting to type I FCoV (n = 39/40) and type II FCoV (n= 1/40), respectively. the findings from phylogenetic analysis of local FCoV further support their biotyping.

RT-PCR was performed using Access RT-PCR system (Promega, USA) [6] with previously described primers p205 and p211. positive samples were further differentiated into type I and type II FCoV. approved final copy for submission; FB: carried out phylogenetic analysis.
