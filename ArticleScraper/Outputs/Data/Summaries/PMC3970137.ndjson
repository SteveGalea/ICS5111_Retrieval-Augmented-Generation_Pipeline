{"summary": "hepatitis a virus is a major cause of foodborne illness, due in large part to the contamination of shellfish by hepatitis A virus (HAV) the prototype of the Hepatovirus genus is composed of an icosahedral capsid that contains a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome. infection is associated with the consumption of virus-contaminated bivalves, including oysters, clams, cockles and mussels. low pH and divalent metal ions enhance the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells due to changes in the viral capsid conformation [11]. the detection of HAV is not directly compatible with PCR, because the method requires an appropriate concentration of sample, removal of interfering substances and the ability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus particles. gG, Lopez-Sabater et al. were able to capture HAV from shellfish extract and remove the interfering materials present. the method currently being used requires expensive antibodies from animal sources. the alternative method would be highly desirable to reduce the cost. ELISAs compared the optical densities of test solution to that of positive control. results showed that the RB of HAV gradually declined as the solution pH decreased from 10.0\u20134.0 (RB: 96.4% at pH 10 to 64.6% at pH 4. binding of viruses to shellfish mucus is either ionic or ionic. ion bonding weakens bonding between virus and shellfish mucus. binding of virus particles increased in acidic pH in adsorption/elution extraction method. binding of viruses to erythrocytes was greatest in acidic medium. the RB of HAV to the cells was lowest in the solution with Fe2+ and highest in solution with Ca2+. previous studies also demonstrated that HAV binding to cell receptors is enhanced by Ca2+ ion. the pH of the Fe2+ solution was very close to 4.0. the level of HAV binding was lowest with UEA-1 and highest with SBA. variation in HAV binding to the different lectins could reflect differences in the carbohydrate specificity of the lectins or specific differences in the interference with HAV binding. RT-PCR detected the HAV in serial 10-fold (101\u2013105) dilutions of the virus. the detection limit of RT-PCR assays was similar to that for HAV without SBA. the amount and type of eluent such as glycine affect the detection of virus. the equal amount of same eluent should be added in all samples. the detection of HAV in the washout fraction means that the amount of SBA-linked magnetic beads was insufficient for the volume of the sample. the RB of HAV gradually declined as the solution pH decreased from 10.0\u20134.0 (RB: 96.4% at pH 10 to 64.6% at pH 4). the binding of viruses to shellfish mucus is either ionic or H+ ion bonding, in which increasing the H+ ion concentration, weakens the bonding between virus and the cells. the binding of the virus particles increased in acidic pH in adsorption/elution extraction method. a previous study reported that the binding of the viruses increased in acidic pH in adsorption/elution extraction method. the possible reason for difference in binding could be the differences in binding surfaces. the RB of HAV to the cells was lowest in the solution with Fe2+ and highest in solution with Ca2+. previous studies also demonstrated that HAV binding to cell receptors is enhanced by Ca2+ ion. the pH of the Fe2+ solution was very close to 4.0. the level of HAV binding to the different lectins was lowest with UEA-1 and highest with SBA. the variation in HAV binding to the different lectins could reflect differences in the carbohydrate specificity of the lectins. RT-PCR detected the HAV in serial 10-fold (101\u2013105) dilutions of the virus. the detection limit of RT-PCR assays was similar to that for HAV without SBA. the amplicons in the washout and eluent fractions were detected at dilutions up to 102 and 104 respectively. the detection means that the amount of SBA-linked magnetic beads was insufficient for the volume of the sample. the method could be compatible with the method prescribed by ISO. HAV strain HM-175/18f (VR-1402) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. titration was conducted using fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells (FRhK-4) based on the method described by Kim et al. the cells were then washed with PBS-T, blocked by incubation with 360 L of 5% skim milk at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. after washing, the cells were again washed with PBS-T, and 50 L of polyclonal anti-HAV antiserum diluted 1:500 in 5% skim milk were added. the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. positive control consisted of digestive cells treated with 100 L of a 1:1 mixture (v/v) of distilled water and HAV. negative control consisted of cells with distilled water prepared under similar condition. RB was calculated using the following equation: RB (%) = A/B 100. the beads were then washed with 200 L of PBS-T. samples containing HAV were transferred to the beads and incubated for 30 min. the beads were then washed again with 200 L of PBS-T and treated with 0.5 mM glycine (pH 2.8) one L of cDNA, 1 L of forward primer (10 pmol/L), 1 L of reverse primer (10 pmol/L), and 17 L of DNase- and RNase-free water were added to the pre-mix PCR kit. the amplification protocol entailed pre-denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and extension at 72 the cells were homogenized in 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) using an Omni Tissue Master Homogenizer. after which the homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells (FRhK-4) based on the method described by Kim et al. odium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH range 5.5\u201310.0) or citric acid (pH 4.0) or metal ions (10 mM) and HAV (104 TCID50/mL) were added to the plates, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. the cells were then washed with PBS-T, and 50 L of polyclonal anti-HAV antiserum diluted 1:500 in ELISAs determined the RB of HAV to lectins PNA, DBA, HPA, UEA-1 and SBA. 50 L of each lectin in PBS (100 g/mL) were added and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. lectin was blocked by incubation with 360 L of 5% skim milk at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. cDNA was synthesized from 9.5 L of the extracted RNA. reaction mixture also contained 2 L of random primer (Takara, Shiga, Japan), 4 L of 5 reaction buffer (Beams), 2 L of 50 mM dithiothreitol (Beams), 0.5 L of RNase inhibitor (Takara) and 1 L of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. amplification protocol entailed pre-denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. the amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide, after which they were visualized under UV light."}
