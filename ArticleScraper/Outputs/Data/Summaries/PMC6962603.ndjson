{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory airway disorder. acute exacerbations are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality. preventing exacerbations remains a major unmet need. innate antiviral immunity is impaired in frequent exacerbators. a cohort of 40 COPD subjects was recruited for a longitudinal study. the study protocol was approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee. subjects were seen within 48 h of onset of their symptoms. repeat visits were carried out at 2 wk after the initial exacerbation visit. inflammatory mediators IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and CXCL8/IL-8 were measured in sputum supernatants. protein levels of all antimicrobial peptides were assayed using commercial ELISA kits. bacterial loads were measured for two cycles of 30 s at 6,800 rpm. total 16S bacterial loads were measured using quantitative PCR. comparisons of sputum mRNA expression and protein concentrations were analyzed. subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or an increase in any of the symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum volume, or purulence. repeat visits were carried out at 2 wk after the initial exacerbation visit. IFN- was measured using a custom-designed LEGENDplex kit (BioLegend) half of the Transwell membrane was carefully cut from the inserts. the remaining Transwell membrane was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h. itative PCR was carried out using previously described specific primers and probes for each gene of interest (35) and normalized to 18S rRNA. DNA extraction from total sputum was performed using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. oral corticosteroids for at least 8 wk for clinical assessment, spirometry and spirometry. subjects were asked about the number of exacerbations experienced in the previous year. subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or an increase in any of the symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum volume, or purulence. RV-A1 infection was applied to the apical surface for 2 h in 250 l bronchial epithelial basal medium (BEBM) minimal at 35\u00b0C. after this, infection media were replaced with 500 l fresh BEBM minimal for the remainder of the experiment. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR. total RNA was extracted from sputum cell pellets or bronchial epithelial cell lysates stored in RLT buffer. 2 g was used for cDNA synthesis (Omniscript RT kit) for baseline analyses of sputum cell mRNA, samples from all patients were available, with 17 patients (42.5%) classified as frequent exacerbators. 36 of the 40-patient cohort had sufficient sample for evaluation. of these, 13 patients (36.1%) were classified as frequent exacerbators. male sex 10 (76.9%) 16 (69.6%) 0.72 Age, yr 69 (60\u201374) 67 (59.0\u201371.5) 0.92 GOLD

baseline sputum levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-, CXCL8/IL-8, or IL-1 in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with frequent exacerbations have reduced antiviral immunity at clinical stability. inflammatory cytokine concentrations at clinical stability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects stratified according to prior exacerbation frequency. patients were stratified according to prior exacerbation frequency in the preceding year with patients who experienced 2 exacerbation episodes classified as \u201cfrequent\u201d sputum 2\u2019-5\u2032OAS mRNA expression was significantly reduced at exacerbation presentation. infrequent exacerbators also had reduced sputum concentrations of the interferon-inducible cytokine CXCL10/IP-10 at exacerbation onset. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with frequent exacerbations have reduced antiviral immunity during virus-associated naturally occurring exacerbations. patients with COPD were stratified according to exacerbation frequency in the preceding year. induction of IFN1 and IFN2/3 mRNAs from baseline was observed in both frequent and infrequent exacerbators at 72 h postinfection. no significant difference was observed for IFN2/3 mRNAs. primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) were differentiated at the airliquid interface (ALI) and infected ex vivo with rhinovirus (RV)-A1 or medium control (baseline) cells were harvested at 72 h postinfection and rhinovirus RNA copies were measured by quantitative PCR. significant induction of IFN-, IFN-1, or IFN-2/3 proteins from baseline was also observed in both frequent and infrequent exacerbators at 72 h postinfection. however, there were no significant differences in the induction of IFN-, IFN-1, or IFN-2/3 proteins by RV between frequent and infrequent exacerbators. airway epithelial cells from frequent exacerbators have impaired antiviral immune responses to infection. there is also evidence that in vitro responses to bacterial infection may be dampened by TNF- and IL-1 (29) there were no differences between level of induction of these cytokines by RV. phenotype is associated with more severe RV infections (21) and inversely related to interferon responses. sputum 16S bacterial loads were measured by 16S quantitative PCR in subjects with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbation. 0.05 ns, nonsignificant. no difference in antimicrobial peptide levels between frequent and infrequent

Treatment during exacerbation Anti ex vivo bronchial epithelial antiviral responses to RV infection are attenuated in frequent exacerbators. we then determined whether epithelial cells from patients with COPD have deficient innate responses to RV infection. baseline was observed in both frequent and infrequent exacerbators at 72 h postinfection. RV induction of IFN1 mRNA was significantly lower in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators. no significant difference was observed for PKR. mRNA was measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter with AC current. an average of three readings was recorded at day 21 post-ALI. no difference in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) between cells at baseline from frequent exacerbators versus infrequent exacerbators. in vivo studies have reported that subjects with frequent exacerbations have higher sputum levels of proinflammatory cytokines at stable state. supernatants harvested at 72 h postinfection with rhinovirus (RV)-A1 or medium control (baseline) supernatants were harvested at 72 h postinfection. TNF- (A) and CCL5/RANTES (B), IL-6 (C), and CCL22/MDC (D) proteins were measured by ELISA. structive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with frequent exacerbations have increased bacterial loads during virus-associated naturally occurring exacerbations. patients were stratified according to exacerbation frequency in the preceding year. a cohort of patients with COPD were monitored prospectively. sputum samples were taken when clinically stable for at least 6 wk. patients were stratified according to exacerbation frequency in the preceding year. 36 of the 40-patient cohort had sufficient sample for evaluation. of these, 13 patients (36.1%) were classified as frequent exacerbators (n = 17) male sex 12 (70.6%) 16 (69.6%) 1.0 Age, yr 70 (61\u201379) 70 (63.5\u201373.8) 0.79 GOLD stage I/II/III/IV 0/9/5/3 8/13/1/1 Long-term oxygen use 1 (5.8%) 0 (0%) 0.43 Cardia 23.1%) 2 (8.7%) 0.33 Cerebrovascular disease 3 (23.1%) 1 (4.3%) 0.54 Pulmonary hypertension 0 (0%) 1 (4.3%) 1.0 Inhaled corticosteroid use 9 (69.2%) 9 (39.1%) 0.16 Beta agonist use 12 (92.3%) 19 (82.6%) 0.63 Antimuscarinic inhaler use 11 (84.6%) 14 (60.9%) 0.26 Current smoker 6 (26.2%) 7 (30.4%) 0.47 GOLD, global patients with COPD were monitored prospectively and sputum samples were taken when clinically stable for at least 6 wk. patients were stratified according to exacerbation frequency in the preceding year with patients who experienced 2 exacerbation episodes classified as \u201cfrequent\u201d sputum supernatant protein concentrations of IL-6 (A), TNF- (B) CXCL8/IL-8 (C) and IL-1 (D) were measured by ELISA. data are displayed as box-and-whisker plots showing median (line within box), interquartile range (IQR); ns, nonsignificant. patients who developed virus-associated exacerbation stratified according to exacerbation frequency. patients with frequent exacerbations have reduced antiviral immunity during virus-associated naturally occurring exacerbations. ex vivo bronchial epithelial antiviral responses to RV infection are attenuated in frequent exacerbators. ex vivo bronchial epithelial antiviral responses to RV infection are attenuated in frequent exacerbators. 0.29 GOLD stage 2 1 (11.1%) 1 (14.3%) 1.0 3 8 (88.9%) 6 (85.7%) 1.0 Male sex 6 (66.7%) 3 (42.9%) 0.61 Inhaled corticosteroid use 7 (77.8%) 3 (42.9%) 0.30 Antimuscarinic inhaler use 7 (77.8%) 3 (42.9%) 0.30 Current smoker 1 (11.1%) 3 (42.9%) 0.26 COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP cell lysates and supernatants were harvested postinfection. expression of viral pattern recognition receptors MDA-5 and RIGI mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. significant induction of the interferon-inducible cytokine CXCL10/IP-10 from baseline was observed in both groups of subjects with a nonsignificant trend. there were also nonsignificant trends toward reduced mRNA expression of the cytosolic viral pattern-recognition receptors MDA-5 and RIG-I following RV infection in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators. there was no evidence to suggest barrier function was involved with no difference in transepithelial electrical resistance ( bators showed nonsignificant trends toward increased TNF- (P = 0.09) and CCL5/RANTES expression (P = 0.15) at baseline. no differences between level of induction of these cytokines by RV. there were no differences in sputum 16S bacterial loads between frequent and infrequent exacerbators at baseline or exacerbation onset. however, frequent exacerbators had a significant increase (1 log) in bacterial loads at 2 wk after exacerbation onset. this suggests that this subgroup may have increased likelihood of secondary bacterial infection during virus-induced exacerbation. there were no differences in sputum SLPI, elafin, lactoferrin, or surfactant-protein D levels between frequent and infrequent exacerbators either at baseline (Fig. 7, A\u2013D) or during exacerbation (Fig. 7, E\u2013H) this suggested that differential expression of these AMPs does not underlie increased secondary bacterial infection in frequent exacerbators. patients with COPD, who have a history of frequent exacerbations, have reduced airway antimicrobial immunity when assessed at clinical stability and during subsequent virus-associated exacerbation with an associated increase in bacterial loads. we also confirm that COPD frequent exacerbators have reduced ex vivo immune responses to RV infection in primary airway epithelial cells. s, IFN, and IFN2/3 mRNAs are reduced in frequent exacerbators at stable state, suggesting that these patients might have a reduced potential to generate protective responses to virus infection. a clinical study found that COPD patients who are frequent exacerbators experience significantly more coryzal episodes than infrequent exacerbators. our studies were limited by sample availability only allowing evaluation at a single timepoint. Bacterial infection is also associated with exacerbation in COPD with increased PCR-based bacterial detection at exacerbation versus stable state, suggesting a causative role (12, 32) recollection of exacerbations may be inaccurate in some subjects. we cannot exclude that recollection of these events may be inaccurate. a shorter follow-up period was adopted in this study. previous studies have indicated that frequent exacerbators have increased systemic and local expression of proinflammatory cytokines. chronic airway inflammation could contribute to defective antiviral responses upon infection observed in some patients.
