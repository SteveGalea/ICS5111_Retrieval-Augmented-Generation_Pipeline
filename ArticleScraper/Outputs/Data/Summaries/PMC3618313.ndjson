{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a multi-factorial disease associated with a primary viral infection followed by a secondary bacterial infection. resistance to respiratory disease in cattle requires host defense mechanisms that protect against viral and bacterial pathogens that have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade the host immune responses. inflammatory cytokines are the main orchestrators of the inflammatory cascade in BRDC, detecting high levels of TNF and IL-1 in the airways of cattle infected with respiratory pathogens [19-22] there is evidence that inflammatory cytokines are the main orchestrators of the inflammatory cascade in BRDC, detecting high levels of TNF and IL-1 in the airways of cattle. twenty-four calves (8\u20139 months old), BVDV and BHV-1 antigen and antibody (Ab) free, were housed in the Animal Experimental Center of Cordoba University (Spain) the animals had an adjustment period of one week before the study started and were separated into three groups based on the inoculation protocol. EDTA blood obtained from coccygeal vein and nasal swab samples was collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 hours post-inoculation, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 14 days post-inoculation. the infected calves were sedated with xylazine (Rompun\u00ae 2% solution; Bayer Healthcare, Kiel, Germany) and euthanized by overdosing with thiopental-sodium ( polymerase chain reaction (PCR) RNeasy Lipid tissue kit (Qiagen) was used to extract BVDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lung samples. the reaction was performed using the real time Ready RNA Virus Master. samples with a cycle threshold value less than or equal to 45 were considered as positive. immunohistochemical methods Formalin-fixed samples were dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol to xylol and embedded in paraffin wax by routine techniques for light microscopy. samples were sectioned (3 m) and stained by different methods as haematoxylin-eosin and the Fraser Lendrum technique. biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary Ab (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing normal goat serum 1.5% was used for the primary pAb. samples were incubated with the ABC complex (Vectastain\u00ae ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for 1 h. 1% protease type XIV (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Chemie) in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.2, for 10 min at room temperature. c Incubation with 0.1 M citric acid (pH 6) and autoclaved for 30 min at 121\u00b0C, 1 atm. reactivity for primary Ab against cytokines and cellular markers used in this study had been demonstrated. a semiquantitative estimation of platelet aggregation Factor-VIII-positive was performed on 50 randomly chosen 0.2 mm2 areas. the results are given as the presence of positive clusters of platelets per area as follows: absent (), mild (+), moderate (++) and abundant (+++) infective dose 50% (TCID50)/mL (courtesy of the Institute f\u00fcr Virologie, TIHO, Hannover, Germany). two calves of this group, BHV-1.1-free, were used as BVDV infection controls. at the same time, ten calves were inoculated only with BHV-1.1 (BHV-1 group) two un-infected animals were used as negative controls. animals were euthanized at the end of the study, being used as UI controls for the BHV-1 group. all euthanized calves were subjected to necropsy examination. all euthanized calves were subjected to necropsy examination. time PCR analysis of the BHV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was performed according to the OIE Terrestrial Manual [42]. any sample with a cycle threshold value less than or equal to 45 was considered positive. the positive control was the BHV-1.1 strain Iowa at 108.3 TCID50/mL. sections were rinsed three times in PBS (pH 7.2) for 10 min and covered with 1% normal horse serum (Pierce-Endogen, Woburn, USA) in 0.05 M Tris buffered saline (pH 7.6) or 20% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. after primary incubation, sections were washed in PBS (three times for 5 min each) and then incubated with the secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. mAb 1:25 TC-microwaveb Serotec Anti-human IL-1 IL-1 pAb 1:100 Tween-20c Endogen Anti-murine iNOS/NOS Type II iNOS/NOS Type II pAb 1:100 TC-autoclaved BD Transduction Lab. anti-murine COX-2 COX-2 pAb 1:75 TC-autoclaved Cayman Chemical Anti-Human Von Willebrand Fact two paraffin-wax blocks from the lungs of each animal were selected. cell counts were carried out on 50 randomly chosen fields of 0.2 mm2. the results are given as the number of positive cells per 0.2 mm2. inoculated calves show more intense respiratory signs such as cough, mucopurulent nasal discharge, dyspnoea and open-mouth breathing mainly between 4 and 11 dpi. the main respiratory signs are given in Risalde et al. [40]. the fraser lendrum technique revealed fibrin microthrombi in some pulmonary venules and capillaries of inoculated calves. these changes were confirmed by the ultrastructural study together with the presence of fibrin in alveoli associated with PAM in both inoculated groups at early stages. these animals displayed an intense hyperaemia as well as interstitial and alveolar oedema during this period. in the BVDV/BHV-1 group, clusters of platelets were observed from 1 dpi. this was more evident throughout the study associated with Ms engulfing platelets that peaked at 4 dpi. subsequently, the positive reaction in Ms and vascular lumina diminished considerably without recovering thereafter. analysis of 100 fields (0.2 mm2 each) from the lung of calves (n = 2 per time point) inoculated with BHV-1.1 (a) versus calves inoculated with BVDV and BHV-1.1 (b) the results are given as follows: absent (), mild (+), moderate (++) and abundant (+++) vascular lumina completely occluded (arrowheads) in the lungs of the BVDV/BHV-1 group at 4 dpi (A), versus a mild lesion (arrowheads) in the co-infected group at 14 dpi (C), in comparison with a total recuperation (arrowheads) in the single infection (D). BHV-1.1 calves inoculated only with BHV-1.1 (n = 2 per time point) secretory activity of Ms observed ultrastructurally was confirmed. TNF and IL-1-producing cells, identified as septal Ms and PAM, were detected immunohistochemically in the lungs of control and infected animals. the number of PAM positive for studied cytokines was low in both inoculated groups, presenting only a slight response at the end of the study. an IL-1 peak in the single infected group between 1 and 2 dpi. septal Ms expressing iNOS decreased significantly after BHV-1 inoculation. in healthy calves, septal Ms presented a similar response after BHV-1 inoculation. the number of iNOS-positive PAM was higher in the BVDV/BHV-1 group. al Ms of the BVDV/BHV-1 group at 4 dpi (p 0.0001). this intense expression occurred at sites of inflammation and injury, mainly oedemas. main respiratory signs are given in Risalde et al. [40] the fraser lendrum technique revealed fibrin microthrombi in some pulmonary venules and capillaries of inoculated calves. these changes were confirmed by the ultrastructural study together with the presence of fibrin in alveoli associated with PAM. these animals displayed an intense hyperaemia as well as interstitial and alveolar oedema during this period. in the BVDV/BHV-1 group, clusters of platelets were observed from 1 dpi. the positive reaction in Ms and vascular lumina diminished considerably without recovering thereafter. there was a significant difference in the presence of platelet clusters in this group throughout the study. the results were obtained for the analysis of 100 fields (0.2 mm2 each) from the lung of calves (n = 2 per time point) inoculated with BHV-1.1 (a) versus calves inoculated with BVDV and BHV-1.1 (b) the results are given as follows: absent (), mild (+), moderate (++) and abundant (+++) transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of multiple aggregations of platelets within the blood vessels with some vascular lumina completely occluded (arrowheads) in the lungs of the BVDV/BHV-1 group at 4 dpi (A), versus a mild lesion (arrowheads) in the co-infected group at 14 dpi (C), in comparison with a total recuperation (arrowheads) in the single infection (D). BVDV and BHV-1.1 calves inoculated only with BHV-1.1 (n = 2 per time point) secretory activity of Ms observed ultrastructurally was confirmed by IHC. TNF and IL-1-producing cells, identified as septal Ms and PAM, were detected immunohistochemically in the lungs of control and infected animals. the number of PAM positive for studied cytokines was low in both inoculated groups, presenting only a slight response at the end of the study. the number of PAM positive for studied cytokines was low in both inoculated groups, presenting only a slight response. mainly IMs, were observed in the pulmonary parenchyma of animals infected only with BVDV. septal Ms expressing iNOS decreased significantly until the end of the experiment (p 0.0001) in healthy calves, septal Ms presented a similar response after BHV-1 inoculation. vascular changes observed in lungs of healthy calves and calves with subclinical BVD both experimentally inoculated with BHV-1.1. results show that following BHV-1 inoculation, both groups displayed a mononuclear cell infiltrate and prompted major vascular alterations in the lungs. the procoagulant activity of BVDV and BHV-1 has been reported in vitro. in the course of certain acute viral infections, platelets may be activated in vivo, leading to their degranulation, aggregation and withdrawal from circulation. despite the concomitance of both agents in the lungs, it does not completely disappear. IL-1 expression until 7 dpi, along with a minimal TNF response, can be ruled out as a potential mechanism for inducing platelet aggregation in the co-infected group. calves inoculated only with NCP BVDV showed greater expression of iNOS by septal Ms than healthy calves. this finding, together with the moderate response of TNF, may have favored the appearance of platelet aggregates in the early stages of the disease the results of this study indicate that the concomitance of BVDV and BHV-1 in the lungs enhances a synergic action of their pathogenic mechanisms. this disrupts the maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis by facilitating the establishment of an inflammatory and procoagulant environment. however, animals pre-inoculated with BVDV exhibit an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines which play a key role in activating the immune response. authors declare that they have no competing interests. MAR participated in design and coordination of the experiment. FR carried out clinical monitoring and tissue sampling. the statistical analysis was performed with the statistical analysis."}
