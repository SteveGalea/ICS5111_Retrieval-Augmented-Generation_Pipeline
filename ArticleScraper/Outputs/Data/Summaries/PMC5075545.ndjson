{"summary": "bocavirus (HBoV) was first identified in 2005 using a protocol based on DNase treatment, random PCR amplification, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. it was initially applied to nasopharyngeal swabs and washings from children with unresolved respiratory tract infections. three additional HBoV subtypes were subsequently identified in human stool samples, named as HBoV2, HBoV3 and HB HBoV genotypes belong to the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Bocavirus, causing infection in vertebrates exclusively[1,18,24]. the family also comprises the subfamily Densovirinae, which infects arthropods and shares no sequence homology with the other subfamily. parvoviruses are small, icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses of 18-26 nm in diameter that contain a single molecule of linear, negative- or positive-sense, single-stranded DNA[1,35] the length of the linear single-stranded HBoV genome is only about 5 kilobases, plus the terminal sequences of 32-52 nucleotides (nt) that play a key role in virus replication the episomal structure has been found for all the HBoV genotypes[36,37,40,41]. HBoV3-E1 genome was shown to contain 5319 nt, flanked with a 513 nt-long terminal non-coding sequence. HBoV2-C2 circular genome (5307 nt, of which 520 nt represent the non-coding terminal region) has been detected as well[41]. NS1 has various sites with different functions in the N-terminus (binding and endonuclease), C-terminus (transactivation) and middle region (ATPase and helicase)[44,45]. NS1 also participates in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and gene transactivation in B19V[47,48]. the complete NS1 gene sequence of HBoV1 (NC_007455.1) is 1928 nt long and encodes a polypeptide of 643 amino acid residues. the HBoV1 NP1 gene is 660 nt long and its encoded protein varies in length among the different strains, ranging from 214 to 219 aa residues. HBoV3 NS1 and NP1 sequences cluster with the homologous sequences Schematic maps of the human Bocavirus genomes were obtained using the Illustrator of Biological Sequences software package[55]. the genes encoding the protein NS1 (non-structural protein), NP1 and VP1/VP2 (capsid proteins) and their nucleotide positions are shown. human bocaparvovirus 1 (including the previous HBoV1 and HBoV3) and human bocaparvovirus 2 (including the previous HBoV2 and HBoV4)[25]. the pathogenesis of HBoV remains poorly characterized, mainly due to the lack of specific cell lines for virus culture or experimental animal models. HBoV1 has been detected in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. a viral load median of 1.88 104 genome/mL has been reported for stool samples. a viral load median of 1.88 104 genome/mL has been reported for stool samples. HBoV2 is the only species isolated from NPA of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections. HBoV mono-infections are rare, while double-infections are observed frequently[9,80]. cases of HBoV infection show a high rate of co-infections with other viral and bacterial pathogens, such as human rhinovirus, adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus. patients with low viral load are more likely to be co-infected with other pathogens compared to those with high viral load (57% vs 38.9%) high viral load (> 104 copies/mL) has been shown to be statistically associated with severe clinical manifestations and longer hospitalization[35,84,93] HBoV1 induces IFN- against HBoV VP2 VLPs, IL-10 and IL-13 (Th2 cells) in CD4+ T cells. this suggests that HBoV infection can induce production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. studies of subjects estimates of studies of HBoV+ subjects estimates (%) (95%CI) (%) (95%CI) (%) (95%CI) (%) (95%CI) (%) (95%CI) (%) (95%CI) Argentina 4 1536 13.5 (11.8-15.3) 4 208 55.8 (49.0-62.5) Australia 10 2745 13.0 (11.7-14.2) 3 132 64.4 (56.2-72.6) Belgium 1 445 11.5 (8.5-14.4) 1 51 49.0 (35 japan 8 5016 10.1 (9.3-10.9) 5 435 61.1 (56.6-65.7) Jordan 1 312 18.3 (14.0-22.6) 1 57 89.5 (81.5-97.4) Kenya 1 384 1.8 (0.5-3.2) 1 7 100.0 (-) Kuwait 1 735 1.9 (0.9-2.9) NG - Malawi 1 95 6.3 (1.4-11.2) NG - Mexico 1 162 4.9 (1.6-8.3) 1 8 37.5 (4.0-71.0) New the Philippines 2 1284 1.0 (0.5-1.6) 1 7 71.4 (38.0-100) Turkey 10 3949 2.3 (1.8-2.8) 4 39 30.8 (16.3-45.3) United Kingdom 8 14923 1.5 (1.3-1.7) 4 102 32.4 (23.3-41.4) Uruguay 1 1078 4.1 (2.9-5.3) 1 44 54.5 (39.8-69.3) United States 21 13549 9.8 (9.3-10.3) 14 903 38.1 (34.9-41.3) Vietnam 3 Germany 2 338 8.3 (5.3-11.2) 2 28 28.6 (11.8-45.3) Hong Kong 1 1600 6.4 (5.2-7.6) NG NG - Hungary 1 61 3.3 (0.0-7.7) NG - Iran 4 621 14.2 (11.4-16.9) 1 16 0.0 (0.0-0.0) Ireland 1 155 7.7 (3.5-11.9) 1 12 100.0 (100.0-100.0) Italy 2 1291 2.8 (1.9-3.7) 2 36 22.2 (8.6-35. the average prevalence of HBoV in respiratory tract samples ranged from 1.0% (CI: 0.0-2.0) to 56.8% (CI: 46.9-66.8) and in stool specimens from 1.3% (CI: 0.0-3.9) to 63% (CI: 55.0-71.1), depending on the country. prevalence averages 2% have been reported for Cambodia (1.6%, CI: 1.2-2.0), Kenya (1.8%, CI: 0.5-3.2), Kuwait (1.9%, the co-infection ratio is 46.7% (CI: 44.2-49.2) relative to the gastrointestinal manifestations. the seroprevalence of HBoV is age-related and ranges from about 40% in children between 18 and 23 mo of age up to virtually 100% in children older than 2 years. the study showed a higher seropositive rate in children of 5-9 years of age. RT-PCR has an advantage over conventional PCR, being more specific and rapid, but its requirement for higher-cost oligoprobes is limiting. multiplexing assays were developed to detect HBoV genotypes in respiratory and gastroenteric infections. serological methods have been developed for the estimation of HBoV-specific antibodies in serum samples. ELISA and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are reliable qualitative and quantitative serologic assays used to detect IgG and IgM antibodies. the pathogenic roles of the HBoV genotypes in respiratory tract illness and gastrointestinal infections remain unresolved. the conflicting ideas on this pathogenic role mainly come from the fact that the Koch\u2019s revised postulates cannot be applied to HBoV. phylogenetic analysis suggests HBoV3 may result from the recombination of HBoV1 and HBoV2. but, it may also be a hybrid of HBoV1 with a common ancestor of HBoV2 and HBoV4. HBoV1 subtypes have been found worldwide, without any regional, geographic or border restrictions. the development of an effective vaccine to control the spread of infection should be of primary importance. a better understanding of the natural course of HBoV infection, the implementation of experimental systems to analyse the replication cycle in more detail are important and urgent needs."}
