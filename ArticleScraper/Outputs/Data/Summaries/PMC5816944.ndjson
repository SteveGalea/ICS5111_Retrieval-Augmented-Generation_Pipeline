{"summary": "bats are pollinators of economically important plants and a source of animal protein. however, they are also reservoirs and vectors for zoonotic pathogens. drivers for transmission are deforestation, intensified farming, livestock production, or the consumption of so-called bush meat (e.g., bats, antelopes, reptiles, rodents) colonization of S. schweitzeri in humans has been reported in three cases with a possible zoonotic source. however, human infections with S. schweitzeri have not been reported yet. samples were collected at six sites on the Obafemi Awolowo university campus in Ile-Ife, Nigeria (A) samples were collected at six sites on the Obafemi Awolowo university campus in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. resistance to penicillin was confirmed by the detection of the bla gene. all isolates were spa typed; multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was done exemplarily for one isolate of each spa type. S. aureus from the DR Congo (ST2353) (Schaumburg et al., 2015), S. aureus from Gabonese bats (ST2984, ST3259, ST3301, ST3302) (Held et al., 2017), and S. argenteus (ST75, ST850, ST1304, ST1850, ST2198) samples were collected at six sites on the Obafemi Awolowo university campus in Ile-Ife, Nigeria (A) the number of samples are indicated for each sampling site. sterile cotton materials (36 45 inches) were placed under roosting sites of Straw Colored Fruit Bats. all isolates were screened for lukS-PV/lukF-PV encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) all isolates were spa typed; multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was done exemplarily for one isolate of each spa type. to analyze the position of the isolates in the overall S. aureus population, we screened the S. aureus MLST Database website (http://pubmlst.org/saureus/), sited at the University of Oxford. to rule out multiple isolates from one bat, we included one isolate per spa type per sampling site and date in the final analysis. Sampling site CC1725 (27) ST1725 (1) t16686 (1) S. aureus Negative (1) None Student Union Building ST1726 (10) t16693 (1), t16697 (3), t16701 (1), t16703 (1), t16703 (1), t16704 (2), t16703 (1), t16703 (1), t16704 (2), t16703 (1), t16734 (1) S. aureus Positive (8) None Student Union Building all isolates were identified as S. aureus by MALDI-TOF. the isolates were reclassified as S. aureus (n = 28, 52.8%), S. argenteus (n = 14, 26.4%), and S. schweitzeri (n = 11, 20.8%) based on nuc and the genealogical clustering of the concatenated MLST alleles. in total, 31 spa types (plus three non-typable isolates) and 19 STs were detected. the predominant STs in S. aureus (n = 28) were ST1726 (35.7%, n = 10), followed by ST4047 (17.9%, n = 5) and ST3959 (17.9%, n = 5). all three species were separated into different clades supported by high bootstrap values. the mean distance between the S. aureus isolates and S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri was 0.1 and 0.08 base substitution per site. the origin of the isolates is color-coded (white: this study, gray: MLST database) the distance between the nodes is shown as the number of differing alleles. sub-Saharan Africa is now considered a \u201cPVL-endemic region\u201d. a transfer of PVL-carrying phages to S. schweitzeri could be possible. S. aureus and S. argenteus from Nigerian bats were phylogenetically distinct from reference isolates. this might point toward a clonal expansion of certain clones among bats. however, the separation of bat-related ST from reference strains might also be due to the low number and low diversity of the reference isolates included in the analysis. a high proportion of S. schweitzeri isolates from bats in Nigeria. the absence of antimicrobial resistance and immune evasion cluster suggest a limited exposure of these isolates to the human host."}
