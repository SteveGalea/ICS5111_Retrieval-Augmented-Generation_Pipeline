{"summary": "coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with the largest genomes of any RNA viruses. epidemiology peaking in the winter and early spring (2\u20134). HCoV-OC43/USA/TCNP_00204/2017 (TCNP_00204), and HCoV-OC43/USA/TCNP_00212/2017 (TCNP_00212) were obtained from children presenting to the University of new Mexico Children\u2019s Hospital (UNMCH) TCNP_00204 was obtained from a 4-month-old who presented with a 1-day history of cough and congestion to UNMCH in January 2017. 204 and TCNP_00212 from new Mexico were 99.8% identical to each other and 99.5% identical to TCNP_0070, also from new Mexico. phylogenetic comparison through nearest-neighbor joining revealed that two of the isolates from new Mexico, TCNP_00204 and TCNP_00212, grouped closely to each other. the other New Mexican isolate, TCNP_0070, grouped together with ACRI_0052."}
