{"summary": "type I interferons (IFNs) consisting of IFN- and IFN-bind to cells expressing IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) 1 and IFNAR2. subsequently activate Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 heterodimerize upon JAK1/Tyk2-mediated tyros active RNase L destroys both viral and cellular RNAs (mRNA and rRNA) within the cells. the degradation of 28S and 18S rRNA is associated with suppressed viral proteins synthesis. the role of RNase L has been extensively illustrated in RNA viruses. sRNase L KO-PK cells attenuated cellular RNA degradation and inhibited poly (I: C)-induced apoptosis. sRNase L KO-PK cells were more susceptible to PRV in comparison with the parental PK-15 cells. sRNase L-KO-3-Fwd and sRNase L-KO-4-Rev were annealed to form sRNase L-KO-4P. then, sRNase L-KO-4P was inserted into EZ-Guide-XH vector. plasmids were sequenced to confirm correct insertion of sRNase L-KO-3P and sRNase L-KO-4P. sRNase L-KO-4-Rev CTAGGTCGTTGGCTCGGCTG sRNase L-Rev CTAGGTCTGGCCATCACCAGCTC sISG43-Rev TGAGGAGAGAAATG ISG43 amplification sISG15-Rev GGAGGAGAGAGAAATG ISG15 amplification sISG15-Rev. sRNase L KO-PK cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 16 h. the same blot was incubated by -actin antibody as a protein loading control. sRNase L KO-PK cells were transfected with Px459M-sRNase L-KO. RT-PCR primers of sRNase L-Fwd and sRNase L-Rev used in this study were listed in Table 1. sRNase L gene was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector which contains a fusion GST tag for purification. rRNA Degradation Assay PK-15 and sRNase L KO-PK cells were seeded onto coverslips in 12-well plates and grown to 70 to 80% confluence. cells were transfected with 2 g/mL poly (I: C) for 7 h. the coverslips were treated with 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the coverslips were mounted with antifade mounting medium. each experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated three times. first-strand cDNA was synthesized using gDNA Eraser kit. 1 l cDNA was subsequently used for SYBR green PCR assay. abundances of individual mRNA transcripts in each sample were assayed three times. sRNase L-KO-3-Fwd and sRNase L-KO-3-Rev were annealed to form sRNase L-KO-3P and inserted into EZ-Guide-XH vector. the sRNase L-KO-4-Fwd and sRNase L-KO-3-Rev were annealed to form sRNase L-KO-3P and inserted into sRNase L-KO-4P. sRNase L-KO-4P was inserted into Px459M vector by XhoI and HindIII sites from EZ-Guide-XH vector. the plasmids were sequenced to confirm the correct insertion of sRNase L-KO-3P and sRNase L-KO-4P. sRNase L KO-PK cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 16 h. the same blot was incubated by -actin antibody as a protein loading control. the same blot was incubated by -actin antibody as a protein loading control. sRNase L KO-PK Cell Line PK-15 cells were transfected with Px459M-sRNase L-KO using the Lipofectamine\u00ae 3000 reagent. at 24 h after transfection, cells were selected with 5 g/mL of puromycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) which was diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS. three days later, the positive clones were isolated, trypsinized and diluted in Western Blotting Assay PK-15 and sRNase L KO-PK cells were grown in 6-well plates for 16 h and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. samples were resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. rRNA degradation was assessed by running RNA samples on 1% agarose gels. cells were seeded onto coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with 2 g/mL poly (I: C) at 7 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. one part of culture supernatants was titrated by a microtitration infectivity assay. the remaining part of culture supernatants was analyzed using real-time PCR assay. the primers used for PRV gD gene amplification were listed in Table 1. the DNA of PRV SD1404 strain was tenfold serially diluted. all assays were repeated at least three times, with each experiment performed in triplicate. sRNase L Mediates rRNA Degradation Poly (I: C) has been used to mimic viral dsRNA-induced OAS/RNase L pathway. parental PK-15 and sRNase L KO-PK cells were transfected with 2 g/mL of poly (I: C) for 7 h. total cellular RNA was extracted and analyzed on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer. no significant difference was observed between these two cells in the absence of poly (I: C) treatment. the results suggested the essential role of sRNase L in poly (I: C)-induced apoptosis. 43, ISG15, ISG56, OAS1, and Mx1 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. the cells without poly (I: C) treatment were used as negative controls. sRNase L KO-PK cells are highly susceptible to PRV wild type and Vaccine Strains. PK-15 and sRNase L KO-PK cells were individually infected with PRV SD1404 or Bartha-K61 vaccine strain at an MOI of 1. culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times. the relative PRV DNA levels of PRV SD1404 (b) or Bartha-K61 (d) strain were determined. bartha-K61 36 h 110 5.10.1 TCID50/mL 110 4.40.2 TCID50/mL 5.01 SD1404 48 h 110 6.90.2 TCID50/mL 110 6.20.1 TCID50/mL 5.01 Bartha-K61 48 h 110 6.40.2 TCID50/mL 110 5.60.3 TCID50/mL 6.31 SD1404 60 h 110 5.90.3 TCID50/mL 110 RT-PCR showed a 1392 bp band in sRNase L KO-PK cells. there was no sRNase L protein expression in sRNase L KO-PK cells by Western blotting. sRNase L Mediates rRNA Degradation Poly (I: C) mimics viral dsRNA-induced OAS/RNase L pathway. sRNase L is Indispensable for poly (I: C)-induced cell apoptosis. parental PK-15 and sRNase L KO-PK cells were transfected with 2 g/mL poly (I: C) for 7 h and subjected to TUNEL staining.

CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system facilitates studies on the biological function of cellular proteins due to its convenience to construct gene knockout cell lines. in this study, active sRNase L manipulates virus replication through cleaving cellular and viral RNA [28] and inducing cell apoptosis. sRNase L downregulates all examined ISG mRNA expressions including ISG43, ISG15, ISG56, OAS1, OAS2 and Mx1. antiviral effects of RNase L have been described on Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Coxsackie B4 virus, West Nile virus, Coronaviruses, Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and Vaccinia virus (VV) the sRNase L KO-PK cell line may have the potential for use in production of attenuated vaccines of other viruses that can cause a significant concern to animal health industry."}
