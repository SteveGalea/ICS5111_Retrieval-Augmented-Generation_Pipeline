{"summary": "a novel coronavirus was identified as its cause. the disease is presumed to be spread by droplets, close direct or indirect contact, but the relative importance of these routes of transmission is presently unclear. the role of fomites and environmental contamination in transmission of infection is presently unclear. a recent study using surrogate coronaviruses has investigated the effect of air temperature and relative humidity on coronavirus survival on surface. the survival effects of these environmental factors on the SARS coronavirus remain unclear. infected cells were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. appearance of CPE was recorded daily. TCID50 was determined according to Reed and the Muench method. the infected cells were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. appearance of CPE was recorded daily. TCID50 was determined according to the Reed and the Muench method. one hundred microlitre of MM was used to resuspend the virus at 0 hr, 3 hr, 7 hr, 11 hr, 13 hr, 24 hr, and up to 4 weeks. the residual virus infectivity was titrated in quadruplicate on 96-well microtitre plates. a similar experiment was conducted at room temperature and relative humidity of about 40\u201350% (air-conditioned room) for up to 4 weeks. Virus dried on plastic retained viability for up to 5 days at 2225\u00b0C at relative humidity of 4050% with only 1 log10 loss of titre (Figure 1). after that virus infectivity is gradually lost ever time. contaminated surfaces are known to be significant vectors in transmission of infections in the hospital setting as well as the community. survival of viruses on a variety of fomites has been studied for influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses and poxviruses. the role of fomites and environmental contamination in virus transmission may play a significant role in virus transmission. fomites may contribute to the continued transmission of infection in the nosocomial setting that continues to occur. reenforcing contact precautions and hand washing is called for. the dynamics of SARS epidemic involves multiple factors including physical property of virus, outdoor and indoor environments, hygiene, space, and genetic predispositions. it may also explain why Singapore, which is also in tropical area, had most of its SARS outbreaks in hospitals (air-conditioned environment) 2 40 5 (100) 0 (0) Mar-03 Apr-03 Thailand 9 42 2 22 9 (100) 1 (11) Mar-03 May-03 Philippines 14 41 2 14 7 (50) 4 (29) Feb-03 May-03 Total 8096 774 9.6 142 1706 (21) Table 2. 82 78 Feb 7 23 31 High 77 71 March 6 24 31 High 76 70 April 6 24 31 High 77 74 May 6 24 32 Extreme 79 73 June 6 24 31 High 79 73 July 6 24 31 High 79 72 Aug 6 24 31 High 78 72 Sept 5 24 31 High 79 72 Oct 5 23 31 High 79 75 Dec 4 23 31 High 82 78 (e)"}
