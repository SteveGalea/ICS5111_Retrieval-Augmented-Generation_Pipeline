{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) constitute the largest class of biomedical proteins [1]. they are increasingly being considered as therapeutic agents to fight both acute and chronic severe human viral diseases. many of them developed in the most recent period [2], [2]. mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) with viral antigens exposed at the surface of virions. mAbs form immune complexes with viral antigens exposed at the surface of virions. this may ultimately impact on endogenous immunity. mAbs have been poorly investigated in vivo to date. id organs before penetrating into the central nervous system (CNS), which leads to a fatal neurodegeneration within 1\u20132 months [17]\u2013[19]. animals infected at a later stage do not develop any neurological illness due to the inability of FrCasE to penetrate the CNS after day 8 after birth but, instead, may develop fatal erythroleukemia. survival in good health is not due exclusively to an immediate effect on the viral load preventing brain infection. mAb treatment effectively limits viral propagation and prevents mice from developing FrCasE-induced erythroleukemia within 4\u20135 months. mAb treatment effectively limits viral propagation and prevents mice from developing FrCasE-induced erythroleukemia. a short 667 mAb treatment prevents infected animals from developing erythroleukemia. we compared frCasE-infected, 667 mAb-treated mice to 3 control groups. all non-infected/treated mice and most infected/treated mice survived without pathological symptoms for the 8 months of the experiments. infected/treated animals, viremia was transient, peaking by day 8 post-infection. peak was reduced by approximately 4-fold and narrower. effect of 667 was more marked on SICs than on viremia. infected/non-treated mice showed a high and constant level of SICs. a group of mice that was not infected but that was treated with 667 (non-infected/treated), was taken as a negative control. the data presented are representative of 2 independent experiments. each time point is the average of values obtained from 2 animals per time point except in the case of day 8 (5 animals) anti-FrCasE IgG1 and -IgG2a were found in both groups of animals. they were always at least 2-fold more abundant and their predominance increased with time in infected/treated mice. we then compared the cellular immune responses against FrCasE-infected cells developing in infected/non-treated and infected/treated animals. infected/treated mice, the CD8+ T-cell response dropped to background levels by day 22 post-infection. however, it was 2-fold higher in the latter group of mice at the peak of the response. phenotype of the GagL peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell population remains after contraction phase. Spleen cells from 2 mice of each group per time point and from 5 mice per group at day 15 post-infection were stained with an anti-CD8 mAb and the Db-GagL tetramer. mice were infected and treated as in Figure 1. mice were challenged with FrCasE-infected splenocytes on days 56 and 116 post-infection and analyzed 9 days later for both the expansion and killing activity of this cell pool. a weak antiviral CD8+ T-cell response below the sensitivity of the assay could not formally be excluded. infected/treated and infected/non-treated mice challenged on day 56 or 116 post-infection. non-challenged age-matched non-infected/non-treated mice were used as controls. statistical significance of data between infected/treated mice was established using a non-parametric one-way ANOVA test. cytometry- and in vivo CTL assays and (ii) no (7/9 mice) or very few (2/9 with 0.006 and 0.16%) SICs were found in the 9 non-leukemic mice. a transient 667 treatment shortly after infection led to a functional long-lasting memory CTL response whereas infected/non treated mice only developed a weak primary CTL response. both infected splenocytes (SpFr) and infected splenocytes complexed with the 667 mAb stimulated proliferation. this showed that cellular ICs were more efficient than simply infected cells at stimulating the proliferation of FrCasE-infected cell-specific CTLs by BMDCs. BMDCs were prepared and exposed to various sources of antigen. BMDCs were cultivated with the GagL peptide (used as positive control), FrCasE and FrCasE ICs made with 667 (Fr-IC) FrCasE-infected splenocytes (SpFr) were complexed with either 15 g of the 667 F(ab')2 (SpFr- F(ab')2) or with 10 g of the 667 mAb (SpFr-IC) non-infected splenocytes incubated in the absence (Sp) or in the presence of 10 g of 667 (Sp-IC) were splenocytes (SpFr and SpFr 1:10, respectively) in the absence of 667. the other two were injected with the same amount of FrCasE-infected splenocytes complexed to 150 g of 667. nine days later, they were tested for the expansion of GagL-specific CD8+ cells and for CTL activity in vivo. the data of Figure 6A show that SpFr-IC were taken up faster and more efficiently than SpFr. the differential uptake efficiency was dependent on FcRs. BMDCs were incubated for 24 hours in the presence of SpFr, SpFr-IC or LPS. splenocytes from infected/treated mice were assayed by flow cytometry at days 8, 15 and 35 post-infection. as a significant fraction of DCs can express retroviral proteins in mice infected with muLVs, we also considered that cellular ICs may have favored DC-, or DC precursor, infection by FrCasE. 20% of splenic DCs were Env-positive in infected/non-treated mice on both days 8 and 15 post-infection. in contrast, only 1% and 3% of their counterparts were positive in infected/treated mice at the same time points and no Env-positive cell was detected at a later time (day 35) the treatment by 667 diminishes it because reduced viral spread in infected/treated mice limits infection of DC precursors. a GagL-TCR-TG CD8+ T cell proliferation was detected in the presence of sera from infected/treated mice (pool 2). no proliferation was seen with either pool of sera when used at identical anti-FrCasE concentrations. however, this effect was dose-dependent, which may explain why the CD8+ T-cell response was weaker in infected/non-treated mice than in infected/treated ones. cytolysis activity of sera from infected/non-treated mice was similar to spontaneous cytolysis in control naive mice. in vivo cytolysis of infected cells observed by 667 administration was higher than that observed by sera from infected/treated mice. values are the average SEM of experiments conducted with 4 mice per condition. the statistical significance was established using the Student's t test (*P = 0,0007) the values are the average SEM of experiments conducted with 2 mice per condition. cytolysis experiments were conducted after either having depleted NK cells by administration of an anti-asialo GM1 antibody or inactivated complement activity through injection of the cobra venom factor. all mice showed the first symptoms of erythroleukemia at 2 months post-infection. these were spleen swelling, due to exacerbated erythroblast proliferation, and reduction of hematocrits. a short 667 mAb treatment prevents infected animals from developing erythroleukemia. all infected/control mAb-treated mice died of erythroleukemia by 4\u20135 months post-infection. we assessed to which extent 667 could affect viral propagation by assaying both serum viremia and the number of infected splenocytes (spleen infectious centers or SICs) in infected/treated animals, viremia was transient, peaking by day 8 post-infection with levels that were already high on day 4 post-infection two groups of 8 day-old mice were infected with FrCasE. one group was treated with 667 (infected/treated) 1 hour post-infection. another was not treated (infected/non-treated) anti-FrCasE total IgG levels accumulated to much higher levels in infected/treated mice with a peak (400 g/ml) by day 56 post-infection and a still high level (120 g/ml) at the end of the experiment (day 243 post-infection) antiviral IgGs accumulated to much higher levels in infected/treated mice. transmembrane form of the Gag precursor polyprotein (gPr80gag) is expressed by infected cells but not incorporated into virions. both infected/non-treated and infected/treated mice developed a transient primary CD8+ T-cell response already detectable by day 8 post-infection and peaking by day 15. however, it was 2-fold higher in the latter group of mice at the peak of the response. infected/treated mice generated an important CD8+ T cell memory pool. primary CD8+ T-cell responses against FrCasE-infected cells. mice were infected and treated, or not. data from 1 age-matched non-infected/non-treated (naive) mouse and 4 infected/treated mice are presented. we then assessed the ability of GagL-specific memory CD8+ T cells from infected/treated mice to trigger efficient secondary responses. animals were challenged with FrCasE-infected splenocytes on days 56 and 116 post-infection. in a new tab Mice were challenged with FrCasE-infected splenocytes on days 56 or 116 post-infection and 9 days later CD8+ T-cell responses were assessed. infected/treated and infected/non-treated mice were challenged on day 56 or 116 post-infection. non-challenged age-matched non-infected/non-treated mice were used as controls. all mice except mouse 172 showed a memory cellular CD8+ T-cell response in both flow cytometry- and in vivo CTL assays. a transient 667 treatment shortly after infection led to a functional long-lasting memory CTL response whereas infected/non treated mice only developed a weak primary CTL response. expressing a TCR specific for H2Db-restricted GagL [34] was then assessed in vitro. no GagL-TCR-TG CD8+ T-cell proliferation was observed in the presence of either FrCasE alone or FrCasE complexed with 667 (Fr-IC) both infected splenocytes (SpFr) and infected splenocytes complexed with the 667 m ICs were more efficient at stimulating proliferation of GagL-specific CD8+ T cells (Figure 5A and Figure S5) and enhancing CTL responses against infected splenocytes. the results indicated that 667-involving cellular ICs enhance CD8+ T-cell responses in vivo. the statistical significance between the SpFr and SpFr-IC groups in these 3 experiments was established using the Student's t test (*P =0,0003) four groups of mice (n = 3) were administered i.v. to non-infected/non-treated mice. two of them were injected with either 2106 or 2105 FrCasE-infected splenocytes in the absence of 667. the other two were injected with the same amount of FrCasE-infected splenocytes complexed to 150 g of 667. PKH26-labelled SpFr or -SpFr-IC were given to BMDCs in the presence or in the absence of the 2.4G2 mAb. BMDCs were incubated for 24 hours in the presence or in the absence of the 2.4G2 mAb. BMDC were co-cultured with SpFr or SpFr-IC for 48 hours before flow cytometry assay of MHC-II+Env+ cells. infection-sensitive Mus dunni fibroblasts were used as positive controls in parallel experiments. muLVs require mitosis for proviral integration and viral function expression. we also monitored Env positivity of splenic DCs in both infected/non-treated and infected/treated mice in the post-infection period. the treatment by 667 diminishes it, presumably because reduced viral spread in infected/treated mice limits infection of DC precursors. anti-FrCasE antibody titers were higher in infected/treated mice. we compared the CD8+ T-cell priming efficiencies of the 2 serum pools at identical dilutions and at identical anti-FrCasE antibody concentrations. no proliferation was seen with either pool of sera when used at identical dilutions. i.v. injected a mixture of non-infected- and FrCasE-infected splenocytes in 2 month-old naive mice. this was followed by i.p. administration of either (i) 667 or control PBS or (ii) pools of 2 sera from 3 month-old non-infected/non-treated, infected/non-treated or infected/treated mice. in vivo cytolysis activities were assayed after administration of CFSE-labeled FrCasE-infected splenocytes (SpFr) and cytometry analysis after 5 or 24 hours. values are the average SEM of experiments conducted with 4 mice per condition. va from infected/treated mice treated with anti-NK antibodies or cobra venom factor were administered i.v. to mice treated or not with either anti-NK antibodies or the cobra venom factor. the values are the average SEM of experiments conducted with 2 mice per condition. lysis by both 667 and endogenous antiviral humoral response of infected mice. mAb allows frCasE-infected mice to mount a long-lasting protective immunity. this \u201cvaccine-like\u201d effect contrasts with the non-protective immune response in infected/non-treated controls. direct immunomodulatory mechanisms involving the formation of ICs seem essential. cdc interactions lead to enhanced humoral- [39]\u2013[42] and stronger CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses due to more efficient DC activation/maturation characterized by better generation and presentation of antigens. in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SIV-infected macaques with ICs made up of p55gag + anti-p55gag IgGs led to more efficient stimulation of precursor CTLs against SIV-infected cells than stimulation by p55gag alone [47]. however, no data concerning protection from disease was reported in the latter study. 667-complexed FrCasE-infected splenocytes are more efficient at inducing anti-FrCasE CD8+ T-cell responses than non-mAb-complexed cells. one challenge is now to elucidate the intimate cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby cellular IC-activated DCs can induce stronger immune responses than simply infected cells. cellular ICs allow the presentation of the full viral antigenic repertoire. this includes determinants not incorporated into virions but expressed only in infected cells. this is probably crucial for rejection of infected/leukemogenic cells by CTLs. lysis of apoptotic tumor cells with antibodies enhances antitumoral immune responses. anti-FrCasE antibody titers are higher in mice with residual SICs compared to those with undetectable SICs. a second important issue is why the response is maintained at a low level in infected/treated animals except under conditions of challenge. the endogenous immune response induced by the immunotherapy can take over the mAb to contain viral propagation long after the end of the treatment. it also suggests that this antiviral immunity is capable of self-maintenance through a complex balance between the humoral and cellular arms of the immune response. an important challenge will be to determine whether passive mAb-based immunotherapies can influence the immune response of chronically infected adult mice. a possible first application of this effect might be the treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV for two reasons: the need of novel therapies because of spontaneous resistances of certain patients to current chemotherapies. our data also strongly suggest that the potent effect of 667 on the viral load is due to, not only its neutralizing activity, but also its in vivo cytolytic activity against FrCasE-infected cells mainly through ADCC-mediated mechanisms. however, it is unlikely that limiting viral propagation is the sole mechanism whereby this mAb impacts on endogenous humoral and cellular anti-FrCasE responses. cellular ICs formed during a mAb-based passive immunotherapy can be crucial for inducing a long-lasting protective antiviral immunity. interactions of such IC with FcRs expressed on DCs are important in the induction of enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses. no data on protection from disease was reported in the latter study. most likely scenario for enhanced CTL response in infected mice is that 667 would initially target FrCasE-infected cells and lyse them by ADCC. the resulting cellular immune complexes would then be efficiently taken up by DCs, owing to interactions with FcRs. one challenge is now to elucidate the intimate cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby cellular IC-activated DCs can induce stronger immune responses than simply infected cells. in vivo, cellular IC-activated DCs may interact with, not only CTLs, but also other effector cells such as CD4+ lymphocytes. this is probably crucial for rejection of infected/leukemogenic cells by CTLs. the coating of apoptotic tumor cells with antibodies enhances antitumoral immune responses in various settings. anti-FrCasE antibody titers are higher in mice with residual SICs compared to those with undetectable SICs. a second important issue is why the CTL response is maintained at a low level in infected/treated animals except under conditions of challenge. elicitation of specific CTL responses by adequate levels of antibodies directed against tumor antigens has recently been reported in therapeutical vaccination experiments against cancer cells [55]. the endogenous immune response induced by the immunotherapy can take over the administered mAb to contain viral propagation long after the end of the treatment. this antiviral immunity is capable of self-maintenance through a complex balance between the humoral and cellular arms of the immune response. passive immunotherapy-stimulated antiviral immunity approaches may be limited to cases of suspicion of infection in young individuals by life-threatening viruses such as HCV or HIV. an important challenge will be to determine whether passive mAb-based immunotherapies can also influence the immune response of chronically infected adult mice. anti-MuLV Env mouse 667 (IgG2a) and 678 (IgG1) mAbs [21] were purified as previously described. the mAb was mixed with pepsin at concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) the unbound fraction was collected as the F(ab\u2032)2. cells were allowed to reach confluence, at which time ffu were scored. eight day-old mice were infected i.p. with 100 l of a virus suspension containing 5105 ffu/ml and treated or not with 30 g of 667 or the control anti--2,6-fructosan mAb. u were score by FIA [see 18], [62]. assay of CD8+ T cells specific for FrCasE-infected cells by flow cytometry 5105 splenocytes were stained with both an anti-CD8-APC- (Becton Dickinson) and a PE-labeled MHC class I H-2Db tetramer (Beckman Coulter) specific for the Friend Virus GagL peptid GagL-loaded- and control splenocytes were labelled by incubation in either 5 M CFSE (CFSEhigh cells)- or 0.5 M CFSE (CFSElow cells)-containing PBS. labeled cells were mixed in a 11 ratio and 107 cells of the mix were injected i.v. in each recipient 8 days after viral challenge. 16 hours later, mice were sacrificed for flow cytometry quantification of splenic CFSE retroviral Env expression on splenic DCs was assessed by flow cytometry. co-expression of Env, CD11c and MHC-II on splenic DCs was assessed by flow cytometry. non-infected and FrCasE-infected splenocytes were labeled with 0.5 M (Sp CFSElow) and 5 M (SpFr CFSEhigh) CSFE. a mixture of non-infected and FrCasE-infected splenocytes at 11 ratio was pre-incubated with either 667 or pools of sera containing anti-FrCasE antibodies. GM1 anti-NK antibody was administrated i.v. to mice on days 6, 3 and 1 prior to cytolysis assay. 60 units of cobra venom factor (Quiadel) were administrated i.p. 1 day prior to cytolysis assay. 20 units the same day of the assay, respectively. the 667 F(ab')2 was prepared as follows: 667, at concentration of 3 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) was mixed with pepsin at concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) the mixture was incubated for 7 hours at 37\u00b0C. the undigested mAb was removed by protein A column chromatography. eight day-old mice were infected i.p. with 100 l of a virus suspension containing 5105 ffu/ml. mice were treated or not with 30 g of 667 or control anti--2,6-fructosan mAb. hematocrits reached 35% to avoid unnecessary pain. 5105 splenocytes were stained with an anti-CD8-APC- (Becton Dickinson) and a PE-labeled MHC class I H-2Db tetramer (Beckman Coulter) specific for the Friend Virus GagL peptide (Db-GagL tetramers) for 15 min at room temperature in PBA (PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.01% sodium azide) cells were 107 cells of the mix were injected i.v. in each recipient 8 days after viral challenge. 16 hours later, mice were sacrificed for flow cytometry quantification of splenic CFSElow and CFSEhigh cells. co-expression of Env, CD11c and MHC-II on splenic DCs was assessed by flow cytometry 8, 15 and 35 post-infection. assay of CD8+ T cells priming activity ICs were formed by incubating 5104 FrCasE-infected splenocytes (SpFr-IC) with either (i) 10 g of the purified 667 mAb (SpFr-IC) or (i in vivo experiments, 2105 or 2106 FrCasE-infected splenocytes (SpFr) were incubated or not with 150 g of the purified 667 mAb. they were administered i.v. into naive mice to assess GagL-specific CD8+ T-cell expansion potential and cytotoxic activity. SpFr and SpFr-IC were stained with the red-fluorescing dye PKH26 (Sigma) [66] at a concentration of 2 g/ml for 5 min. half of the preparation was used to form SpFr-IC. uptake was quantified by flow cytometry. infected/control mAb-treated- and infected/non-treated mice showed comparable spleen swelling (not shown) bars indicate mean values. data presented are the compilation of results from 3 independent experiments. data from 2 age-matched non-infected/non-treated mice and 3 infected/treated mice are presented. infected/treated mice generate a substantial CD8+ T-cell memory pool mainly composed of effector-memory cells. two groups of mice (n = 3) were used. in one group, 2106 FrCasE-infected splenocytes (SpFr) were injected in the absence of 667. in the other group, the same amount of FrCasE-infected splenocytes was used after immune complex formation with 150 g of 667 (SpFr-IC)"}
