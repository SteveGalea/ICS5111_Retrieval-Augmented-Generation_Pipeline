{"summary": "experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was initially identified in 1868 by Charcot. this disease often begins in young adulthood with intermittent episodes of neurological dysfunction. these are attributable to recurrent inflammatory attacks on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which lead to the accumulation of perivascularly distributed inflammatory cells within the brain. encephalitogenic part of MBP in vitro can be distinguished from an unprimed rat T-cell population. this confirms that autoreactive T cells play a central role in the pathology of MS [6\u20138]. this allows the further dissection of the immunopathogenic potency of different encephalitogenic CD4+ cells. mice deficient in IL12 (IL12p35), a component of the Th1 paradigm, are vulnerable to EAE. IL12R2-deficient mice develop more severe clinical manifestations of EAE. IL12p40-deficient mice are resistant to EAE. IL17-producing CD4+ T cells were dramatically reduced in the CNS of IL23p19-deficient mice. researchers confidently suggested that IL17-producing CD4+ T cells are a distinct Th subset that exacerbates autoimmunity. the discovery of Th17 cells further clarifies the cytokine profile of MS [35]. Th17 cells produce IL17A, IL17F, IL21, and IL22. transcription factors are key regulators of the cytokine expression required to launch lineage-specific transcriptional programs. T-bet and STAT4 transcription factors are important in the differentiation of autoimmune T cells in the EAE model [48] chemokine CCL20 and the transcription factor ROR can differentiate into several previously identified effector subsets. each transcription factor drives a specific set of genes required for lineage commitment and the expression of signature cytokines. the local microenvironment is the driving force that determines the outcome of the differentiation course. IL17 is a recently described cytokine produced in humans almost exclusively by activated memory T cells. patients with MS have greater numbers of IL17-mRNA-expressing mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in the blood, with the highest levels in the blood detected during clinical exacerbations. inflammatory and immune cells, such as granulocytes and macrophages, are attracted into the CNS parenchyma. they mediate tissue inflammation, leading to demyelination and tissue damage. any damage to the CNS can activate immune cells in situ. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) but not TNFR2 signaling is critical for demyelination and the limitation of T-cell responses during immune-mediated CNS disease. expression of IL17 is evident in perivascular lymphocytes and in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes located in active areas of CNS lesions. IL23p19-expressing mature DCs are preferentially located in the perivascular cuffs of active lesions. perivascular DCs express high levels of IL17R and are more permeable to IL17 than are non-MS endothelial cells. il17 functions in synergistic manner with IL6 to induce IL6 expression in astrocytes. this is consistent with the astrocytes' capacity to express IL23 subunit p19 and the common IL12/IL23 subunit p40, but not IL12 subunit p35 when these two cell types are cocultured. astrocytes are critical in IL17\u2013Act1-mediated leukocyte recruitment during EAE. the complex interactions of Th17 cells with different DCs contribute to the immunopathogenesis of EAE and MS. the complex interactions of Th17 cells with different DCs contribute to the immunopathogenesis of EAE and MS. cytokine environment was converted from a disease-promoting IL23-producing condition to a disease-limiting IL4-producing condition by the local expression of IL4 from a Herpes simplex virus vector delivered to the brain [80]. the increased expression of IL4 in glial cells was associated with the reduced severity of EAE [81], suggesting that the upregulation of Th2 cytokines inhibits the propagation of the inflammation of EAE/MS. the loss of STAT3 by Th cells results in an intrinsic developmental defect. STAT3 is required for the production of IL17 by Th17 cells, the generation of double positive T cells expressing IL17 and IFN, and T cell trafficking into CNS tissues. IL21 plays a pivotal role in the expansion and differentiation of the Th17 lineage. IL21 also promotes IL23R expression in differentiated Th17 cells. IL27-driven c-MAF expression transactivates the production of IL21. the ability of this T-cell subset to induce EAE is currently being investigated. the authors suggest that the different effector Th subsets that induce EAE do so differently. the disease induced by Th17 cells in some animals showed symptoms atypical of EAE, including ataxia, severe imbalance, and weight loss associated with high mortality. Th2 cells, Tr1 cells, and Tregs exert repressive effects on Th17 cells. Th9 cells have a stimulatory effect on Th17 cells, suppressing EAE and MS. however, Th9 cells play dual roles in EAE. the third domain involves the development of migration-modifying therapies. agents that affect adhesion molecules include natalizumab and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonists. the fourth domain includes neuroprotective agents associated with immunomodulation. mice of EAE and IFN(/) mice of EAE had increased numbers of CD11b(+) leukocytes infiltrating affected brains and increased percentage of Th17 cells in the CNS. the therapeutic effect of IFN is probably attributable to the induction of the regulatory cytokine IL10 [104] IFN-1b exerts its therapeutic effects at least in part by targeting B cells' functions that contribute to the autoimmune pathogenesis of RR MS. this may uncover extra mechanisms of the B-cell contribution to the autoimmune effects and provide novel targets for future selective treatment of MS. natalizumab, a humanized mAb directed against the VLA-4 adhesion complex, has been introduced into the treatment of MS and reduces the risk of sustained progression of disability and the rate of clinical relapse in patients with relapsing MS. natalizumab was returned to the market as a monotherapy in July 2006 for the treatment of relapsing MS. however, there were 111 cases of PML reported subsequently in natalizumab fingolimod (FTY720/Gilenya, Novartis), an S1PR modulator, is under the spotlight because it has completed phase III trials. fingolimod (FTY720/Gilenya, Novartis), an S1PR modulator [132], is under the spotlight because it has completed phase III trials. fingolimod inhibits the function of S1PR. cladribine is a synthetic chlorinated deoxyadenosine analog. it is activated by intracellular phosphorylation in specific cell types. it mimics the immune-deficient status of hereditary adenosine deaminase deficiency. cladribine reduces relapses by 55\u201358%. potential therapeutic interventions at different levels of the immunopathological cascade are shown in the filled yellow boxes (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTL]; interferon [IFN]; IL2 receptor [IL2R]; major histocompatibility complex class II [MHC II]. advances in identifying unique therapeutic targets for MS have instigated numerous phase II and phase III trials. E3 protects mice against EAE by inducing DCs to increase their expression of inhibitory costimulatory markers (PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H3) and deviate towards a Th2 phenotype. PPARs are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormones. no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24. levels of p40 subunit of IL12 were elevated during 18 months of minocycline treatment. the downregulation of MMP9 activity was reduced by minocycline treatment. DcR3 is a soluble receptor that binds to members of the TNF family. it inhibits the binding of TNF to TNFRs when DcR3 binds to FasL. it also counteracts the effects of Th17 cells by interfering with FasL-Fas interactions. the identification of Th17 cells has shed light on this apparent discrepancy. polarized Th17 cells have the capacity to cause inflammation and autoimmune disease. polarized Th17 cells have the capacity to cause inflammation and autoimmune disease. the treatment of MS has always been hampered by the untoward adverse effects caused by immunosuppression with agents such as natalizumab [128]. Currently approved disease-modifying treatments achieve their effects primarily by blocking the proinflammatory response in a nonspecific manner."}
