{"summary": "animal study three native-born adult male dromedary camels were obtained through private sale. the animals tested negative by neutralization assay for MERS-CoV and for bovine coronavirus by ELISA. the animals were acclimated to the facility for 2 weeks before virus inoculation. nasal turbinates, lungs, trachea, larynx, pharynx, liver, spleen, bladder, urine, duodenum, jejunum, colon, rectum, colon, abomasum, forestomachs, prescapular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, medulla, and olfactory cortex were euthanized. a funnel was placed over the muzzle of each camel and for detection of viral RNA, we used 5 L of RNA in a one-step reverse transcription PCR upE assay (24) using the Rotor-GeneTM probe kit. dilutions of a titered virus stock were run in parallel, to calculate TCID50 equivalents in the samples (25). a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1:1,000) was provided by the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. the virus was propagated in vero E6 cells cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) the animals were observed at least 1 daily for the duration of the experiment for behavior, food consumption, activity level, and nasal discharge. the animals were observed at least 1 daily for the duration of the experiment for behavior, food consumption, activity level, and activity level. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR We extracted RNA from swab samples, fecal samples, and serum samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit. for detection of viral RNA, we used 5 L of RNA in a one-step reverse transcription PCR upE assay (24) using the Rotor-GeneTM probe kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. to detect MERS-CoV antigen, we completed immunohistochemical testing using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1:1,000) each camel showed minor clinical signs of disease. rhinorrhea developed in all 3 camels beginning at 2 (camels 1 and 3) and 5 (camel 2) dpi. infectious virus and viral RNA were detected in oral samples. small quantities of MERS-CoV RNA were detected in exhaled breath by qPCR (101.2 and 101.4 TCID50 equivalent/mL) but infectious virus was not detected. in the lower respiratory tract, infectious virus was detected in the trachea and in 1 of 4 lung lobes tested. on necropsy of camel 1 at 5 dpi, histologic lesions were found in pseudostratified epithelial cells in the URT and the lower respiratory tract. viral antigen was present at the follicular mantle zone of the tonsils and mediastinal and retropharyncheal lymph nodes. the nasal turbinates, larynx, and trachea of camel 2 (necropsied at 28 dpi) had similar but milder lesions compared with those of camel 1. degeneration of the pseudostratified epithelium lining the nasal turbinate, trachea, and bronchus is indicated by the absence of goblet cells, cilia and nuclear regimentation with infiltration of neutrophils. arrowheads indicate areas where the cilia remained intact. Rhinorrhea developed in all 3 camels beginning at 2 (camels 1 and 3) and 5 (camel 2) dpi. nasal discharge drained from both nares and varied in character from serous to purulent. minor hemorrhage was observed on some occasions. dromedary camels inoculated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) shedding was determined by A) infectious titers by plaque assay and B) viral load by quantitative real-time PCR. we extrapolated 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) equivalents from standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a MERS-CoV stock. tropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes characterized as mild to moderate acute intraepithelial and submucosal inflammation. multifocal loss of epithelial polarity and cilia with squamous metaplasia were observed. the epithelium was infiltrated by small-to-moderate numbers of neutrophils with fewer macrophages. immunohistochemical testing revealed the presence of limited viral antigen in the nasal turbinate but not in any of the other tissues at that time. tissues were collected at 5 days postinoculation for camel 1, 28 dpi for vamel 2 and 42 dpi for camel 3. Detectable infectious virus was found only in camel 1. camel 1 was euthanized at 5 dpi and was not tested for development of antibodies against the virus. dromedary camels inoculated with the virus as determined by 90% plaque reduction assay*. the large quantities of MERS-CoV shed in nasal secretions by each of the 3 camels suggest that camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission may occur readily through direct contact and large droplet, or possibly fomite transmission. the URT, specifically the respiratory epithelium in the nasal turbinates, is the predominant site of MERS-CoV replication in camels. the influence of camel age on susceptibility and dynamics of virus shedding is another notable parameter that needs further study. it seems likely that productive infection and shedding of virus occurs predominantly in juvenile camels (28) this could be the result of an intrinsic difference in age-related susceptibility, but is more likely related to the immunologically nave status of the animals."}
