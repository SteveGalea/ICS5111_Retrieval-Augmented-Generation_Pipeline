{"summary": "leukocyte-mediated pulmonary inflammation is a key pathophysiological mechanism involved in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cell stiffness was assessed by measuring the entry time (ET) of a single cell into a microchannel with a 6 9\u2013m cross-section under a constant pressure drop. ing correlated with the cytokines interleukin IL-1, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor TNF-, and IL-10 but not with interferon-, transforming growth factor-, IL-6, or IL-17. incubations with sera and blocking antibodies against IL-1, IL-8, or TNF- significantly diminished the stiffening effect of serum. the cell was incubated for 30 minutes with the serum (at 10 %) of a healthy volunteer (first sequence) and of a patient with ARDS (second sequence)."}
