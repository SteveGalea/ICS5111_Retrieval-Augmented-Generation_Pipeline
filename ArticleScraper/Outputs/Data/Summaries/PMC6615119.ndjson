{"summary": "global health diplomacy (GHD) is relatively a very new field that has yet to be clearly defined. globalization combined with the acceleration and intersection of knowledge and technology has revamped the conventional ways of conceptualizing the medical, economic, and political means of improving health. the rise of health as a foreign policy concern has indicated an increasing commitment and agreement by a wide array of public and private actors at various levels of governance. the information is compiled as per its emergence, role, dynamics, and application in foreign policy. this literature review exercise defines certain concepts such as global health, health diplomacy, history of GHD, and finally the role of GHD in improving health and human security. global health is concerned with the well-being of world's poorest people, regardless of where they live. global health has become more of an interdisciplinary field, with links increasingly made between health and international trade, intellectual property rights, agriculture, education, and the environment. global health environment builds on 160 years of history establishing structures to promote health and fight diseases across national borders. the subhistory of GHD can be broken down into five periods: the first international Sanitary Conferences (1839\u20131900), the first international health organizations (1900\u20131950), the creation of WHO (1948\u20131977), the Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care for All (1978\u20132000), and most recently, during the postmillennium shift toward a multipolar world. new hybrid, synergistic, interdisciplinary dynamics have produced the field of GHD. the relationship between health, foreign policy, and trade is an example of the cutting edge of GHD. related issues include international patent deals, vital need to regulate access to vaccines, and essential medicines list. diplomacy Often includes countries as well as nonstate actors negotiating on health-related issues The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and GAVI (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) The 2012 London Summit on Family Planning Interactions between health actors from one country acting in another country Include the activities of official and semiofficial representatives from donor countries acting in recipient countries. foreign policy community has yet to reach such an epiphany in relation to global health. global health is defined as \u201cthose health issues that transcend national boundaries and governments\u201d. global health is concerned with the well-being of world's poorest people, irrespective of where they live. global health environment builds on 160 years of history establishing

postmillennium shift toward a multipolar world. new hybrid, synergistic, interdisciplinary dynamics have produced the field of GHD. they are evident in the 2009 UN Secretary General's report to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) the relationship between health, foreign policy, and trade is an example of the cutting edge of GHD. cy Often includes countries as well as nonstate actors negotiating on health-related issues The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and GAVI (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) The 2012 London Summit on Family Planning Interactions between health actors from one country acting in another country Include the activities of official and semiofficial representatives from donor countries acting in recipient countries. the group of eight (G8) countries has addressed health issues to an unprecedented degree over the past decade. issues-specific meetings such as the international AIDS Conference and the International Workshop on Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Control have seen increasing participation of heads of state. there is rising acknowledgment and acceptance that closer interaction between the health and foreign policy communities is both desirable and mutually beneficial. health initiatives have been closely linked to trade, economic, and diplomatic ties. even the united states\u2019 PEPFAR was launched in 2003 at the outbreak of the Iraq war. this approach recognizes that disease is a major threat to human lives, health, and well-being. human security is a concept under which the general principles of human rights are interpreted and analyzed at the level of a single citizen. human security is a concept under which the general principles of human rights are interpreted and analyzed at the level of a single citizen. global interventions are considered necessary when a threat is pervasive. common examples are the epidemics of cholera, measles, smallpox, polio, HIV/AIDS, SARS, H1N1 and the recent Ebola virus disease. it also includes threats emanating from the state against its people. human security is a shared responsibility that cannot be achieved by a single actor or sector of government. the global health security agenda illustrates how the discourse of human security has permeated U. S. foreign policy. cies are organized around rules, routines, and standard operating procedures. the WHO must adhere to the scientific procedures prescribed by the International Health Regulations. a public health emergency of international concern must be declared. major health and human security alerts were put in place following the Ebola outbreak in west africa in march 2014. global health issues involving diplomacy have become more diverse, ranging from pandemic infectious diseases to the sale of unsafe, counterfeit drugs. the venues for diplomacy also now have unprecedented diversity. the speed of events, and its impact on players, problems, and processes, also affect how diplomatic activities reflect different normative concepts and international legal rules. health problems now include concerns related to antimicrobial resistance, emergence and re-emergence, product consumption, environmental degradation, poverty alleviation, and sustainability in national governance and healthcare capacities. health can be negatively affected by the lack of agreements where they are most needed. health can also be negatively affected by the lack of agreements where they are most needed. health can also be negatively affected by lack of agreements where they are most needed. a qualitative shift in the relationship between foreign policy and global health occurs when foreign policy serves the interests of health. this shift is reflected in the Oslo Ministerial Declaration prepared by the ministers of foreign affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa and Thailand in 2006. \u201dHuman security\u201d was coined within the UN system. it is universal, people-centered, interdependent, and based on early prevention. seven interconnected dimensions of human security were also described. a growing interdependence among nations has challenged the traditional notion of \u201csecurity\u201d. health is central and offers a concrete basis for developing human security strategies. global health security is a shared responsibility that cannot be achieved by a single actor or sector of government. despite progress on human security, there remain real limitations to policy implementation. health governance is still largely state-centric, bureaucratic, and grounded in international law. addressing human security is an \u201cintermestic\u201d and not just a \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201cinternational\u201d concern. addressing human security is an \u201cintermestic\u201d and not just a \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201cinternational\u201d concern. addressing human security is an \u201cintermestic\u201d and not just a \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201cinternational\u201d concern. global health problems have become more diverse, ranging from pandemic infectious diseases to the sale of unsafe, counterfeit drugs. the venues for diplomacy now have unprecedented diversity, involving processes from the august chamber of the UNSC[34] to the private offices of the Gates Foundation. the 2010 report highlighted the rise of inter-linkages between global health and foreign policy. there is even greater scope and need for this inter-linkage. global health, beyond direct efforts to contain disease, will also advance other realms of human security. conflict of interest There are no conflicts of interest."}
