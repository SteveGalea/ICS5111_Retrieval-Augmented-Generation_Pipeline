{"summary": "two PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed using G2b PEDV-Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) trimeric full-length S and truncated S1\u2013501 proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression system. sensitivity and specificity of these two ELISAs were compared to immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells the results of the full-length S-based ELISA shared an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92) with that of S1\u2013501-based ELISA. both full-length S-based and S1\u2013501-based ELISA exhibit high sensitivity and high specificity for detecting antibodies against PEDVs."}
