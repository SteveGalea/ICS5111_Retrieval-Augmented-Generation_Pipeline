{"summary": "a number of gene expression studies have indicated that aberrant processing of the messenger RNA transcriptome in CTEPH may provide a mechanistic convergence between the diverse genetic heritability of this disease and the disruption of fundamental signaling pathways, resulting in the common CTEPH phenotype. lncRNA molecules have been shown to play an important role in the control of imprinting, cell differentiation, immune response, pathogenesis of various human diseases, tumorigenesis and other biological processes. however, the expression and biological function of lncRNAs in CTEPH remains to be elucidated. the six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were hemodynamic variables applied to assess the cardiopulmonary function and prognosis of the CTEPH patients. all the patients received oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 6 months and underwent PEA in accordance with the guidelines of the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (Beijing, China) healthy control samples were obtained from five lung transplant donors. gene-level data were filtered to include only the probe sets derived from the \u2018core\u2019 metaprobe list, representing the reference sequence (RefSeq) genes. random variance model (RVM) t-test was used to filter differentially expressed genes in the control and CTEPH groups. core regulatory factors are determined by degree differences between the CTEPH and normal tissue samples (25), since they show the highest degree differences. the network was constructed using Cytoscape software version 2.8.3 (Cytoscape Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA) five patients diagnosed with CTEPH were recruited to the study. the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee of Beijing Chaoyang University. microarray profiling cDNA was generated via reverse transcription of RNA obtained from pulmonary artery endothelium samples using a reverse transcription kit. cDNA obtained from pulmonary artery endothelium samples of the CTEPH patients or normal controls was hybridized to GeneChip\u00ae Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays. gene-level data were normalized using the robust multiarray average method (17), followed by median summarization of the transcript expression levels. the simplest and most important measure of gene centrality within a network is degree centrality. degree centrality is defined as the number of links a particular node has to other nodes in the network (23), while degree centrality is defined as the number of links a particular node has to other nodes. differentially expressed genes were analyzed independently according to whether they were upregulated or downregulated. P-values were calculated for the differentially expressed genes in all GO categories. in total, 185 lncRNAs were identified in which the expression levels were significantly different between the two groups. the characteristics of the five CTEPH patients and five normal controls are shown in Table I. 14.7 2/3 55 (33\u201378) 1,075.4 454.6667 SD, standard deviation; M, male; F, female; mPAP, mean

have used chromatin-state maps to identify 3,019 lncRNAs with a clear evolutionary conservation. these are associated with distinct and diverse biological processes (such as cell proliferation), RNA binding complexes, immune surveillance, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, neuronal processes, morphogenesis, gametogenesis and muscle development. a total of 832 network nodes formed 3,239 coexpression pairs of lncRNAs and mRNAs. one mRNA may correlate with numerous lncRNAs and vice versa. a total of 832 network nodes in the two networks formed 3,239 coexpression pairs. the most important signaling pathways relevant to CTEPH were found to be antigen processing and presentation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and leukocyte transendothelial migration. lncRNAs are hypothesized to modulate the host response through their effect on nearby protein-coding genes. 20 GO:0051249 Regulation of lymphocyte activation Up 5.151022 8.981019 GO:0051251 Positive regulation of

clinical characteristics and outcomes in CTEPH patients. a concerted effort to genetically characterize CTEPH may provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and development of the disease. heat-shock RNA-1 ncRNA binding to heat-shock transcription factor 1 has been found to result in the induction of heat-shock proteins (44). rom et al (46) recently identified that noncoding RNA-activators 1\u20137 can enhance the expression of nearby genes. lncRNA expression signatures have been detected in prostate carcinoma and hepatic tumors (49). the networks intrinsic to the CTEPH phenotype are hypothesized to be involved in the normal functioning of the pulmonary artery endothelium. mRNAs are likely to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH, while lncRNAs function through the epigenetic modification of mRNAs. four lncRNAs with the largest diffK were further investigated. the FOXP2 gene is involved in the normal development of the areas of the brain controlling speech and language during embryogenesis. mutations in this gene result in speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1), also termed as autosomal dominant speech and language disorder with orofacial dyspraxia. expression levels of a number of lncRNAs were found to be aberrant in tissue samples from CTEPH patients. these deregulated lncRNAs may function as activators or suppressors of genes involved in the development and progression of the disease."}
