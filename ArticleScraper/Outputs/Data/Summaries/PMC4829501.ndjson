{"summary": "the occurrence of pig diarrheal disease has been recorded in china. the disease showed a local endemic tendency with significant seasonal variations. PEDV was confirmed to be the cause of such outbreaks in 1984. a series of investigations of PED occurrence were conducted in china. virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine bocavirus, porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus, Lawsonia intracellularis and porcine deltacoronavirus have also been found in diarrhea samples from pigs [10, 12, 44]. these data demonstrated that PEDV occurred extensively among the pig population in china and that PEDV was the major cause of viral diarrheal diseases in swine during the recent outbreaks. however, co-infections of other intestinal pathogens partial S and M genes of PEDV 43.0% samples were positive for PEDV; 12.0% samples were positive for PEDV and TGEV. all south China PEDV strains have a close relationship with most of the strains in Korea and Thailand. PEDV exhibits rapid variation and genetic evolution. strains are composed of three early domestic strains but differ genetically from the vaccine strain (CV777) and the early Korean strains. three new PEDV variants were identified based on full-length S gene sequences. circulating PEDV strains in Guangdong from 2011 to 2013 have a genetic composition that is distant from reference strains, especially the vaccine strains (CV777). these new PEDV variant strains in Gansu Province might be from south Korean or South China. the spike (S) protein-encoding gene of 99 selected PEDV strains was divided into two groups. the GI group consists of two subgroups (GIa and GIb) and the GII group also consists of two subgroups (GIIa and GIIb) three PEDV strains (Chinju99, Spk1 and KNU-0901) from south Korea and two Japanese strains (KH and NK) formed one specific GIb group. phylogenetic analysis of the S1 region of the S gene of PEDV strains from 2004 to 2015 in china revealed that the PEDV field strains circulating in China showed varying degrees of variability. the recombination analysis revealed that four potential recombination events occurred between the 65 PEDV strains from china. one potential recombinant event occurred between a GI group strain and a GII group strain, and three potential recombinant events occurred within GI group strains. sequences Program or method of recombination detection 1 CH-ZWBZa-01-2015 strain (KR296680/2015/GII) CH/JL/2011 strain (KR296681/2015/GII) 11\u2013762 RDP (P=7.15E-22); GENECONV (P=6.89E-20); Maxchi (P=3.49E-16); Chimaera (P=3.04E-16); 3Seq (P=8. potential recombination events occurred between the 65 PEDV strains from china. recombinant event occurred between the minor parent strain and major parent strain. a tissue-inactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using PEDV strain S [38] through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate in piglets was 77.28%. the passive immunization protection rate was 97.06%, while the immunization protection period was six months. tong et al. prepared an attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine based on the attenuated PEDV vaccine. the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (1999 to present) and the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (2003\u20132006) are extensively used in the pig population. lactic acid bacteria expressing the PEDV N protein could activate the production of mucosal IgA and circulating IgG antibodies against the PEDV N protein. recombinant lactobacilli expressing the N protein and the core neutralizing epitope could stimulate the intestines to produce local immune responses. studies of PEDV have provided an in-depth understanding of PEDV infections in the pig population in china. however, virus variability and co-infections of PEDV with other enteric viruses are unpredictable. future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains and co-infections of other enteric viruses."}
