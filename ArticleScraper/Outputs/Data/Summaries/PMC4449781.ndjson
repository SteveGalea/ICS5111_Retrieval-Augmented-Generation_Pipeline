{"summary": "an anti-inflammatory therapy in sepsis clinical trials was unsuccessful. the assumption that poor outcome in patients with or at high risk of critical conditions derives from an uncontrolled proinflammatory response is questionable. however, an anti-inflammatory therapy in sepsis clinical trials was unsuccessful. bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are included in multiple scoring systems for post-injury multiple organ failure8. hyperbilirubinaemia is both a risk factor and complication of sepsis, which is associated with a reduction of the bile flow in hepatocytes9. hyperbilirubinaemia has been correlated with worse outcomes and predicted the development of ARDS10\u201313. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines have been shown to influence the level of the gene product (missense SNP in the IL13 gene) the main end-points studied in association with SNPs were sepsis, mortality and ARDS. 430 patients at risk of critical illness were hospitalized at the clinical bases of the V. A. Negovsky Research Institute of general Reanimatology, Moscow, Russia. the severity of each patient was evaluated on the basis of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score within the first 24 h after ICU admission. measurements were carried out within the first day of ICU admission and on the subsequent third, fifth, seventh and 14th days. the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of V. A. Negovsky Research Institute of general Reanimatology RAMS. SNPStats provides odds ratios (OR), confidence intervals (CI) and the P-values for multiple inheritance models (dominant, recessive, over-dominant, co-dominant and additive) the lowest AIC value was considered the best-fitting model for the fitted variant. in the sepsis study, statistical power was 6675% (IL1B rs16944; OR = 027) in the hospital mortality study, statistical power was 9496% (IL1B rs16944; OR = 041) in the ARDS study, statistical power was 7145% (IL4 rs2243250; OR = 041) and 4150% (IL13 rs20541; OR = 055) the diagnostics of the ARDS is similar to the ARDS Berlin definition31. all biochemical analyses were performed using Cobas 6000, ABX Pentra 400 and Mythic 22 analysers. logistic regression analysis was performed using the SNPStats package33. the association with disease is modelled depending on the response variable. for binary variables, unconditional logistic regression models are used. the winpepi is a free and user-friendly resource comprising computer programs for a wide spectrum of statistical tools designed for epidemiologists and biomedical researchers. the association study between genetic and biochemical variables was considered exploratory, not requiring corrections for multiple comparisons35. sepsis and mortality, r = 034; sepsis and ARDS, r = 021; mortality and ARDS, r = 030. we calculated pairwise associations for binary variables and found the following correlation coefficients between clinical end-points. normal levels of studied biochemical parameters are considered to be 34\u2013171 mmol/L for total bilirubin, 1.7\u20138.3 mmol/L for BUN, 260\u20131740 U/L for CK, 530\u20131240 mmol/L for creatinine and 890\u20132210 U/L for LDH. in non-survivors, all studied biochemical parameters increased gradually within 2 weeks. the most profound effect was found for AST concentrations in patients with liver insufficiency on the 14th day. the most profound effect was found for AST concentrations in patients with liver insufficiency on the 14th day. Sepsis IL1B n=334 n=78 G/G 146 (437) 42 (539) 0014 (rec)a 511 G>A G/A 145 (434) 33 (423) 027 (008\u2013092) A/A 43 (129) 3 (38) IL8 n=342 n=79 T/T 98 (286) 37 (468) 00023 (dom)b 251 T>A T/A 183 (535) 33 IL13 rs20541 (431 A>G) alleles are reported in reverse orientation to genome. similar associations were found within the first day on ICU admission. the carriers of the IL6 C/C genotype had significantly elevated concentrations of LDH, CK and BUN by the end of the second week. the differences did not reach statistical significance. chemical traits were used to analyse additional clinical phenotypes. the groups with renal and liver insufficiency were small. they were not included in the initial genetic association study. the APACHE II and SOFA scores did not differ between patients with and without trauma. we calculated pairwise associations for binary variables and found the following Pearson's correlation coefficients between clinical end-points. ARDS = adult respiratory distress syndrome; ICU = intensive care unit; APACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; SOFA = Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; s.d. = standard deviation. the mean SOFA score on ICU admission was higher in all studied cases (sepsis, mortality, ARDS, renal and hepatic insufficiency) compared with matched controls. CK and LDH are expressed in many different organs and tissues. after acute trauma, the levels of CK were elevated on the first and seventh days after admission to the ICU. the levels of LDH were higher on the seventh day, compared to non-trauma patients with sepsis. alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 589T and IL13 431A were less frequent in the cases than in the controls. the distribution of genotypes among patients with/without sepsis, ARDS and survivors/non-survivors Genes and genotypes Controls Cases P-value (genetic model), OR (95% CI) Number (%) Sepsis IL1B n=334 n=78 G/G 146 the analysis is adjusted for age, sex, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and using (more than 24 h) of mechanical ventilation. ARDS = adult respiratory distress syndrome; OR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval. the most prominent associations were found for IL8 251 T>A and IL6 174 G>C. the carriers of the IL6 C/C genotype appeared to have elevated bilirubin levels from the first to the 14th day. bars represent mean indicator values for patients carrying specified genotype. analysis adjusted for age, sex, APACHE II score, and using (more than 24 h) of mechanical ventilation. genotypical associations with biochemical traits were used to analyse additional clinical phenotypes. analysis is adjusted for age, sex, Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and using (more than 24 h) of mechanical ventilation. the genetic model: rec = recessive. high-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines IL1B 511A and IL8 251A protected against sepsis development. IL-8 is considered one of the most important cytokines in pathogenesis of ARDS, with the 251A allele. IL8 genetic associations in acute infections may be linked to pathophysiological differences between sepsis-related ARDS and non-sepsis-related ARDS51. the risk allele A (251 T>A) was found more frequently in patients with ARDS than in non-ARDS controls. the genes for IL4 and IL13 are located in a cluster of cytokine genes in the region 5q23-31. the IL4 promoter variant 589C>T allele T is considered a high-producer allele58. IL-6 is a multi-functional cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. it is secreted by hepatic Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) in response to liposaccharide or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)69. IL-6 increases the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1RA and IL-10. IL-6 exerts anti-oxidant capacity in hepatocytes and protects liver from drug-induced hepatoxicity. the best-characterized of these polymorphisms is a promoter SNP rs1800795 at position 174, upstream of the transcription start site. the IL6 association with the level of biochemical parameters, notably bilirubin, and liver and kidney insufficiency in patients without the initially compromised liver and kidney functions. in our sample, it is the IL6 association with the level of biochemical parameters, notably bilirubin. the IL6 174C/C genotype appeared to be linked with increased levels of BUN, CK and LDH. it is an interesting challenge for future research directions to determine if stronger hepatotoxic effects in the carriers of the 174C/C genotype were causal."}
