{"summary": "more sensitive detection methods have enabled earlier recognition of pediatric MS, leading to an estimated 2\u20135% of cases developing before the age of 16 years [10]\u2013[12]. a number of herpesviruses have been investigated as etiological factors for MS. individuals with a history of EBV-induced infectious mononucleosis are at 2- to 3-fold increased risk of developing MS [31], [32] in contrast to the risk being extremely low in EBV-negative individuals [33]. whether active EBV infection actually plays a role in ongoing MS disease is elusive [38]\u2013[40] primary infection occurs very early in life with 47,6% of children infected with at least 3 TTV types at 6 months of age and 93% at 1 year of age. their genomic diversity and ubiquitous prevalence have posed main obstacles in attempts to define a role for TT viruses in the pathogenesis of disease [49], [52], [53] the current study analysed the question whether EBV can stimulate or induce TTV replication in vitro. we transfected two of these TTV isolates into EBV-carrying cell lines. PCR amplification of full-length TTV-HD14b in P3HR-1, BJAB, BJAB/EBV and full-length TTV-HD14c in ND1 and Ramos/EBV cell lines. days after transfection are indicated.

TTV-HD14b versus TTV-HD14c replication varied significantly (p0.05) in each cell type, except for day 17 after transfection. the increased TTV-HD14b replication in Ramos versus EBV cells was statistically significant (p0.0001) up to day 14, where after TTV-HD14b replication in Ramos cells exceeded that in Ramos/EBV cells (days 17 and 21) a previous report did not detect any difference in the level of permissiveness for an HSV-1 infection between Ramos and EBV-converted Ramos/EBV cells. qPCR values are expressed in Ct relative to BJAB. real-time qPCR was applied to determine the EBV genome copies per cell. the actual activity of the EBV DNA is less clear in the Ramos/EBV cell line and unknown for the ND1 cell line. the level of this EBV activity does not seem to influence the level of TTV-HD replication. the results demonstrate replication of both TT viruses up to day 21 post-transfection. a large number of promoters indicated differences in EBNA-1 binding motifs. cellular promoters devoid of EBNA-1 binding sites may even be upregulated by the mere presence of EBNA-1 in the cell. additional investigation is needed to clarify the mechanism through which EBNA-1 may act to stimulate the TTV genome. BV infection in lymphocytes of B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma has been inconclusive. presence of both TTV and EBV in the same B cell is feasible. persistence of EBV infection could provide a fertile field for molecular mimicry. either TTV or TTV in memory B cells leads to persistence of the TTV supported by EBNA-1 expression. TTV autoimmune-reactive epitopes in turn induce autoreactive T cells [97] reacting against specific proteins of the TTV-infected cells. all cell lines (mycoplasma free as confirmed by PCR) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the reason or consequence of these rearrangements in TT viruses is to date not known [52], [67]. at days 14, 17 and 21 were passaged from transfected cultures for day 7, 10 and 14 respectively. cultures were harvested on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 after transfection at an average density of 1\u20131,5106/ml. total RNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol [65]. lysis probes were designed on the TTV-HD14b and TTV-HD14c genomic region spanning nucleotide 1 to 430 (identical between isolates) primers and probes for both TTV-HD14b and TTV-HD14c were obtained from Biomers.net. amplification reactions of HMBS were performed in 25 l volumes. amplification reactions of HMBS were performed in 25 l volumes. HMBS contained 12.5 l Taqman Universal master mix, forward and reverse primers. an initial reverse transcription step (5 min at 50\u00b0C), followed by RT inactivation/initial denaturation (20 s at 95\u00b0C) negative controls included NTC and samples without reverse transcriptase. negative controls included NTC and samples without reverse transcriptase. TTV-HD14b and TTV-HD14c amplification levels were converted to fold changes. comparisons were performed by t-test. hematopoietic cell lines included BJAB and Ramos. the reason or consequence of these rearrangements in TT viruses is to date not known [52], [67]. we therefore selected 2 full-length genomes originating from one brain sample for the transfection assays. the ORF1 of TTV-HD14b (accession number FR751464) is fused with the last 37 nt of ORF4. total RNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol [65] and subjected to DpnI (Fermentas) digestion. all RNA samples were treated with DNaseI (Promega) to remove any residual DNA. the quality of the RNA samples was checked by running the samples in a 1% agarose gel. Genomic DNA samples (100 ng in 5 l) were amplified in triplicate. each volume contained 12.5 l Taqman Universal master mix (Applied Biosystems), forward and reverse primers 0.75 l each (10 M), 0.75 l 5\u2032FAM-3\u2032TAMRA-labelled probe (10 M) the ampliTaq gold DNA polymerase was activated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min prior to amplification through 40 cycles (15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C) amplification was followed by a reverse transcription step (5 min at 50\u00b0C), followed by RT inactivation/initial denaturation (20 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C). gp350/220 gene expression was quantified using an external RNA calibration standard. the gene was transcribed from B95-8 cellular RNA with superScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using specific primers containing restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI. the resulting 200 bp cDNA amplicon was cloned into the pSPT18 vector."}
