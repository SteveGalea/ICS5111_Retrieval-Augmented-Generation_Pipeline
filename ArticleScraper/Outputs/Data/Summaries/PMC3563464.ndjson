{"summary": "epidemiological models have tended to neglect the impact of individual behaviour on the dynamics of diseases. however, awareness of the presence of illness can cause people to change their behaviour by, for example, staying at home and avoiding social contacts. our aim is to study costs and benefits of using individual-based social distancing undertaken by healthy individuals as a form of control. network models have been successfully used to describe the spread of many infectious diseases, ranging from human [1-8] through animal [6,9-11] to plant diseases [12]. the structure of interactions between individuals is most commonly assumed to be fixed and so represents an \u2018average\u2019 behavioural pattern. conventional epidemiological models either treat human behaviour as external to the disease system or even ignore it completely. studies have tended to neglect the associated cost to both society and individuals. social contacts are necessary for economic activity: employees must go to work, students must go to school, and traders and customers must interact in order for an economy to function. awareness of an epidemic presents each individual with a private choice between investing in social contacts and risking infection. in this paper we consider two network models. the first is a regular network which has the advantage of simplicity. but is only a crude representation of real social networks which often display a mixture of short-range and long-range links. both radii can range from 0 (no neighbours) to infinity (whole population) in practice infinity is represented by a finite value big enough to encompass the whole population. the awareness neighbourhood is uniform for all individuals and fixed for the duration of each epidemic. each contact between an infected and a susceptible individual may result in the susceptible becoming infected. the epidemic ends when all infected individuals recover. the simulation proceeds through discrete time steps up to a maximum number of steps. if a susceptible individual detects an infection pressure at the current time step, then the number of contacts that susceptible will make during the next time step is adjusted by choosing a new contact radius r i \u2032. this formula ensures that if no infection is present within a susceptible\u2019s awareness radius (=0), it will resume full contact by reverting to the initial, maximum contact radius r i ( 0 ). the control produces an economic gain if it causes a reduction in the overall impact of the epidemic. the control produces an economic loss by reducing the number of economically beneficial contacts taking place between pairs of individuals. the value of contacts (no control) is calculated by multiplying this number by the length of the reference period. for any given r i ( 0), the value of contacts (no control) is fixed. the value of contacts (control) is obtained by taking the mean of 20 simulation runs with control. in response to infection located in their awareness neighbourhood susceptible individuals reduce their number of local links. at each step the number of active long-range links originating from a susceptible individual is proportional to (1), where represents the infection pressure within the awareness neighbourhood of this individual. non-active long-range links do not contribute to the overall number of contacts. 50 square lattice without edge wrapping (total number of individuals, N=2500), with a fixed proportion of local links rewired to form a small-world model. the specific values shown in the figures have been chosen to indicate clearly the shape of our general results. both radii can range from 0 (no neighbours) to infinity (whole population) in practice infinity is represented by a finite value big enough to encompass the whole population. the awareness neighbourhood is uniform for all individuals and fixed for the duration of each epidemic. the infection neighbourhood varies locally depending on the infection pressure. simulation proceeds through discrete time steps up to a maximum number of steps, chosen to be sufficiently large to allow all epidemics to run to completion. for simplicity we assume the time step equal to one day with most epidemics finished in less than 120 days. if no infection is present within a susceptible\u2019s awareness radius (=0), it will resume full contact by reverting to the initial, maximum contact radius r i ( 0 ). increased local infection pressure causes the infection radius and hence the number of contacts to decrease. d ri(a) and d ri(b) assume that all individuals are aware of their own status (susceptible, infected, or recovered) they reduce their contact neighbourhood because they know they are at risk of becoming infected. infected and recovered individuals no longer have this risk. the value of contacts (control) is obtained by taking the mean of 20 simulation runs with control. the overall net benefit of using the control is then calculated by combining the gain from reducing R with the loss from reducing the number of contacts. if a single contact is considered to be equally valuable as a single case of illness that is prevented, then we would take c=1. in their awareness neighbourhood susceptible individuals reduce their number of local links. we assume that each active long-range link contributes to the calculation of the number of contacts in the same way as local links. non-active long-range links do not contribute to the overall number of contacts. p 0.01 1 probability of infection per contact (per time step) q 0.01 1 probability of removal/recovery (per time step) ri 1 5 contact radius (baseline) ra 1 5, 10, awareness radius 0.01 1.0 risk attitude c 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 Relative cost I(0) 10 400 Initial number of foci (0.4% 40%) effect of social distancing Social distancing shifts the critical infectiousness p towards higher values but also increases the duration of the epidemic. for a given p, social distancing always decreases the final size of the epidemic. but the effect on the duration depends on the value of p. the longer the duration of the epidemic the more pronounced the cumulative effect of the reduction of contacts. both factors combine to reduce the overall number of contacts differentially over p. the effect is relatively minor in regions A and B, but becomes very strong in region C. the control reduces Ralmost to zero, and greatly shortens the duration of the epidemic. this is more than compensated for by the large reduction in R, so that the net benefit is strongly positive. as p enters region D, we reach the worst case scenario for the control. effects of varying c The parameter c represents the relative weight of a single contact between a pair of individuals, compared to a single case of infection. reducing contacts has a greater impact, causing a strong downward shift in regions C and D. if the risk attitude is made more relaxed, the control becomes less effective for more infectious diseases, resulting in a worse outcome than doing nothing. each point is the mean of 20 simulation runs with error bars showing 1 standard deviation. only region A is marked as the locations of regions B, C, and D. control is only beneficial if is extremely risk-averse. for a more infectious disease (p=0.51), control is only beneficial if is extremely risk-averse. small-world model For the case described above, the disease spreads locally. each point is the mean of 20 simulation runs with error bars showing 1 standard deviation. p = 0.25, q = 0.5, c = 0.05, r i = 2 and ra = 2. 20% corresponds to 3,000 links. 30% to 4,500 represents a fully random network. in this case, epidemics progress slowly, infecting only few individuals at a time, but resulting in a massive reduction in the number of contacts over the whole period of their duration. for the particular choice of c this results in a very similar value of the net benefit for 30% and 100% non-local links, although the balance will change when other values of c are selected. the benefit is a non-monotonic function of with a global positive maximum at low values of, a rapid drop to highly negative values for intermediate and improving for large. however, extension of the awareness neighbourhood beyond r i ( 0) reduces the range of for which the benefit is positive and significantly lowers the minimum value of the benefit. ra = is modelled by making the awareness neighbourhood sufficiently large to include the whole population. ra = is modelled by making the awareness neighbourhood sufficiently large to include the whole population. ra = is modelled by making the awareness neighbourhood sufficiently large to include the whole population. for small values of p the disease is non-invasive in both cases. both the final size and the duration of the epidemic are lower in presence of social distancing than without it (region A) in regions B and C, the duration of the epidemic is shortened by the distancing, whereas in region C it is longer. as functions ofp. black lines indicate the result with control. light grey indicates the result with no control. each point is the mean of 20 simulation runs with error bars showing 1 standard deviation. using the control prolongs the period during which social distancing is practised, thus greatly reducing the number of contacts. as p enters region D, we reach the worst case scenario for the control, where using the control makes little difference to the severity of the epidemic or its duration. however, unlike region A, in this case the epidemic is invasive despite the control. c=0.05 is chosen because it best illustrates the generic behaviour of the net economic benefit. each point is the mean of 20 simulation runs with error bars showing 1 standard deviation. q = 0.5, c = 0.05, r i ( 0 ) = 2, ra = 2, and = 0.25. regions B, C, and D vary with, with a highly risk-averse value of, regions C and D disappear. region B (corresponding to the diseases for which the distancing is beneficial) extends from the invasion threshold value of p all the way to p=1. small-world model For networks dominated by long-range spread, the disease spreads locally and can therefore be controlled efficiently by individuals reducing their social activities. addition of randomness increases the propensity of the disease agent to spread by allowing it to create new foci in regions where there is a high density of susceptible individuals. if individuals do not respond to the local infection load, the epidemics are usually very quick (rightmost parts of Figure 10a,b) but the number of contacts lost to social distancing is also small, resulting in the net benefit close to 0 (rightmost parts of Figure 10c,f). model introduces two spatial scales, the infection (and contact) neighbourhood and the awareness neighbourhood. the role of the awareness neighbourhood is to provide an estimate of risks associated with infection. so far we have only considered cases in which the radius of the awareness neighbourhood ra is equal to that of the maximum contact radius r i ( 0 ). the benefit is negative for all values of considered here. a combination of these two mechanisms may contribute to this lack of efficiency. it might be that individuals reduce contacts unnecessarily. a combination of these two mechanisms is responsible for this result. ra = 2 (local awareness) and ra = (global awareness) for fully random network. each point is the mean of 20 simulation runs with error bars showing 1 standard deviation. the more infectious the disease, the greater caution that is required. the control works best when these two areas are the same. if the individual has too little knowledge, the control does not work. if, on the other hand, the individual responds to infection cases which do not pose a realistic risk of infection. the model can only be applied to mild diseases which do not greatly affect the behaviour of infected individuals. the model can be extended in a number of ways, including full recovery, births, deaths and other demographic processes. long-range links are treated the same as short-range links, in terms of reduction of contacts in response to infection and their contribution to the individual well-being. a combination of responses is possible, with different behaviour associated with different kinds of links. surprisingly limited quantitative data available about changes in social interactions during historical epidemics. surveys and questionnaires can provide static snapshots of behaviour. only limited information about changes over time and in response to infection pressure."}
