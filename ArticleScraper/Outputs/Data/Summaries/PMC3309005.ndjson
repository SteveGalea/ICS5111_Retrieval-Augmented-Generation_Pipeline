{"summary": "the role of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in autoimmune and pathogen-induced immune responses has been studied intensively during recent years. depletion of Tregs in several persistent viral infections led to reactivation of virus-specific T cells and reduction of the virus load [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. a transgenic human receptor for MV is not required for intracerebral MV infection of mice. a specific antiviral cellular immune response including an increased proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleen was observed [32]. the role of Tregs for virus persistence in the brain remains to be elucidated. two week old mice were infected with 103 recombinant MV expressing the rodent brain-adapted haemagglutinin CAMH and eGFP. both recombinant viruses (rMVEdtagEGFP-CAMH and rMVEdtagCAMH) have the same distinct tropism for mouse neurons. infections cause similar acute and persistent CNS infections. rMV (not expressing GFP), a small but significant number of GFP+ cells, approximately 800 per brain, was detected in the brains. almost no GFP+ cells were detected in controls. mice were infected and analyzed at 3, 7, 10, 14 and 28 dpi. the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs increased in the spleen and lymph nodes approximately 2-fold. this result indicated that mAb D665 can be used for expansion of Tregs also in young mice. pleen and LN of D665-treated and control animals analyzed at 28 dpi. we applied 100 g at day 14 and 21 post infection, and analyzed the brains at 28 dpi. pleen and LN increased significantly after D665 treatment. transient depletion of Tregs stimulates infiltration of virus-specific T cells into the brain and virus elimination. transgenic mice expressing the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor under the control of the Foxp3-promoter. Lymphocytes isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry to demonstrate the successful depletion of Foxp3+GFP+ Tregs by more than 90%. persistently infected mice were treated at 3 consecutive days (at day 17, 18, and 20 post infection) with 1 g DT and analyzed at day 28 post infection. the number of infected eGFP+ cells per brain was determined by microscopic evaluation of 100 m sections through the complete cerebrum. two recognized peptides, DbMV-H22\u201330 (RIVINREHL) and DbMV-H446\u2013454 (SNHNNVYWL) were identified as effective in stimulating IFN-synthesis using the ELISPOT assay. 28 dpi approximately 18% of all CD8+ T lymphocytes) did not contain virus-specific CD8+ T cells. after treatment of DEREG mice with DT, number of Tregs decreased by approximately 95%. the number of CD8+ T cells in brains slightly increased. two week old mice were infected with 103 recombinant MV expressing the rodent brain-adapted haemagglutinin CAMH and eGFP. both recombinant viruses (rMVEdtagEGFP-CAMH and rMVEdtagCAMH) have the same distinct tropism for mouse neurons. infections cause similar acute and persistent CNS infections. a small but significant number of GFP+ cells, approximately 800 per brain, was detected in the brains. almost no GFP+ cells were detected in controls. mice were infected and analyzed at 3, 7, 10, 14 and 28 dpi. the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs increased in the spleen and lymph nodes approximately 2-fold. this result indicated that mAb D665 can be used for expansion of Tregs also in young mice. the total number of lymphocytes increased significantly after mAb D665 treatment in spleen and LN, but not in the brain. the proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs increased significantly (approximately 2-fold, P0.01) in spleen in LN. persistent phase of the viral infection induced a transient release of the viral infection from immunological control. rMV-green-infected mouse cerebra was prepared from complete rMV-green-infected mouse cerebra and analyzed using the UV microscope. sections of infected eGFP+ cells per brain were determined microscopically in infected control mice at 7, 14, 28 and 42 dpi (D, lanes 1\u20134) and in DEREG-treated mice at 28 Lymphocytes isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry to demonstrate the successful depletion of Foxp3+GFP+ Tregs by more than 90%. in order to assess the effect of Treg depletion on virus persistence in young mice, persistently infected mice were treated at 3 consecutive days. mice with DT at day 17, 18, and 20 post infection and analysis at 28 dpi. the reduction of mean values from 50 to 8 was significant, with P = 0,0098. the number of infected eGFP+ cells per brain was determined by microscopic evaluation of 100 m sections through the complete cerebrum. the number of Tregs decreased by approximately 95%, while the number of CD8+ T cells in brains slightly increased. depletion of Tregs during the persistent phase of infection led to an increase of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the brain. only a small number of infected neurons are present during the persistent phase of the infection. only very few Tregs, if any at all, are required within the brain for regulation of effector immune cells. in vitro experiments demonstrated that CD8+ T lymphocytes control the dissemination of MV. in resistant mouse strains the depletion of the CD4+ T cell subset led to a breakdown of resistance to the infection, whereas depletion of CD8+ T cells had no effect. further investigations revealed that CD4+ T cells are able to protect either alone (in resistant mouse strains), or through cooperation with CD8+ T cells (in mice with intermediate susceptibility) DEREG mice were anesthetized using isofluran and infected intracerebrally (i.c.) into the left hemisphere with 20 l virus suspension containing 1103 PFU at an age of two weeks. mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 g superagonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) D665 [36], and to deplete Tregs, DEREG mice were treated i. photomicrographs were taken with a digital camera (Leica) numbers of infected eGFP-positive neurons were counted and statistical analyzes done using the student's t test and the program Prism (GraphPad, Inc.) monoclonal fluorescein-isothiocyanat (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)- or peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone 145-2C11)-, CD4 (clone RM4-5)-, CD8 (clone Ly-2)-, CD19 (clone 1D3)- and CD25 (clone 7D4)- ELISPOT experiments were performed using the mouse IFN- ELISPOT set. cells were stained with 5 L pentamer-solution diluted in 100 l FACS buffer at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 g superagonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) D665. mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 g diphtheria toxin (DT; Merck) ation of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, the spleen, and the brain Draining cervical lymph nodes and the spleen were pressed through a steel sieve in 4 ml HBSS and homogenized in a total volume of 13 ml HBSS. after a centrifugation step at 170 g for 10 min the cell pellets were resuspended in an adequate volume of HBSS (approximately 107/cell anti-mouse CD3 (clone 145-2C11)-, CD4 (clone RM4-5)-, CD8 (clone Ly-2)-, CD19 (clone 1D3)- and CD25 (clone 7D4)-antibodies were purchased from becton Dickinson. ELISPOT experiments were performed using the mouse IFN- ELISPOT set. pentamers presenting the selected peptide MV-H22\u201330 (DbMV-H22\u201330\u2013pentamers) were ordered from ProImmune Ltd (Oxford, UK)"}
