{"summary": "Flanders virus (FLAV) and Hart Park virus (HPV) are two closely-related members of the Hart Park serogroup of the family Rhabdoviridae that are maintained in mosquito\u2013passerine bird transmission cycles in the eastern and western United States. other members in earlier classifications of the serogroup included Mosqueiro virus (MQOV), a virus first isolated in Brazil, and two African viruses, Mossuril virus (MOSV) and Kamese virus (KAMV) two recently described (but historically isolated) Australian viruses recovered from Culex annulirostris \u2013 Holmes Jungle virus (HOJV) and Ord River virus (ORRV) appear to be new members of the serogroup (Gubala, 2012), as do Bangoran virus (BGNV) and Porton's virus (PORV) the two putative pseudogenes located between the P and M genes contained complete uninterrupted ORFs flanked by conserved transcriptional start and stop/polyadenylation (CU7) sequences. the predicted proteins associated with pseudogene 1, the 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2 ORFs in FLAV were very similar in size, with lengths of 161, 165, and 160 amino acids. pseudogene 1, 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2 sequences of 10 FLAV isolates produced d N/d S ratios of 0.07, 0.02 and 0.09 respectively. also, a d N/d S of 0.07 was observed in 103 pseudogene 1 (U1) sequences. a d N/d S of 0.07 was observed in 103 pseudogene 1 sequences. a slightly larger band of 23 kDa might represent a modified form (e.g., phosphorylated) of one of the pseudogene region proteins or an in vivo cleavage product. the lowest band could represent an additional cleavage product, a faster migrating form of one of the pseudogene region proteins, or the putative SH protein. a bright band(s) approximately 10\u201320 kDa was demonstrated to be abundantly present in purified virions by immunoblotting. however, a bright band(s) approximately 10\u201320 kDa was demonstrated to be abundantly present in purified viruses. a bright band(s) approximately 10\u201320 kDa was demonstrated to be abundantly present in purified viruses and was the only distinct band(s) present beneath the putative M protein in the fluorescent gel. Histone H4 has been observed in vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus particles. other viruses such as retroviruses and coronaviruses have been reported. the absence of other similarly sized core histone proteins suggests its incorporation into virions may be selective. select proteins identified from purified FLAV virions by nano-scale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano HPLC\u2013MS/MS). see text for details. a putative SH ORF encodes a viroporin-like protein which contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (WIGTGILGLLGFIVIK) similar to the transmembrane domain of the G protein (WISIGILIVISILIC), and a highly basic C-terminus. a putative SH protein (120 aa) could be translated by mechanisms such as leaky ribosomal scanning. conserved motifs found in FLAV strongly suggest that the SH protein is expressed by coupled translation. this is the first, albeit tentative, recognition of a rhabdovirus utilizing coupled translation for coupled translation. the viruses used in the alignment were: FLAV 61-7484 (KF028661), norovirus Hu/GII.4/CHDC4871/1977/US (FJ537138), norwalk-like virus SW/NV/swine43/JP (AB126320), and Influenza B virus B/Rochester/02/2001 (KC892131). the two ORFs/proteins involved in coupled expression for each virus are indicated. rhabdovirus is similar to that observed with WONV and suggested for FLAV. the presence of identical motifs present in U1 and U3, but not U2 is of interest. rhabdovirus genomes contain similar initiation and termination sequences. it is unclear whether U1 and U2 have similar roles to U3. whether the functions of U1\u2013U3 are conserved throughout the viruses of the Hart Park serogroup remains to be determined. both the prototypical FLAV (lineage A) and the variant (lineage B) appear to circulate sympatrically, as they have been repeatedly isolated together from the same county (i.e., Lowndes) over a 6-year period (2005\u20132010) all viruses sampled outside of Georgia fell into lineage A, as did all viruses sampled from 1961 to 1999. restuans/Cs. melanuraa Unknown Connecticut 1984 A KF028674 Ar 77-84 Cx. restuans/Cs. melanuraa Unknown Connecticut 1984 A KF028673 RI 907-36 Cs. melanura westerly Rhode Island 1999 A KF028677 CLA 31-02 Cx.

FLAV was purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and select SDS-PAGE protein bands were further analyzed by nano-scale high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. however, a bright band(s) approximately 10\u201320 kDa was demonstrated to be histone H4 (11.4 kDa) and cyclophilin A (17.9 kDa) have been previously identified as being incorporated into rhabdovirus virions. cyclophilin A (a chaperone protein involved in protein folding) has been shown to bind to N and is required for VSNJV replication. Hsp70 is a protein chaperone that has been demonstrated to associate with N in rhabdovirus particles. it is often subverted from the host by viruses for a variety of functions. biological significance of these cellular proteins within FLAV particles remains to be determined. we suggest that the pseudogene 1 and 2 sequences be renamed as U1 and U3 for clarity among related viruses. a putative ORF between the G and L genes in FLAV encodes a vi. roporin-like protein contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (WIGTGILGLLGFIVIK), similar to the transmembrane domain of the G protein (WISIGILIVISILIC), and a highly basic C-terminus. conserved motifs found in FLAV suggest that the SH protein is expressed by coupled translation. the pentanucleotide termination\u2013reinitiation sequence (UAAUG) is shown in bold italics. the 18S rRNA complementary region (motif 1) is in dark blue. the two base-pairing motifs postulated to form RNA secondary structures are shown in grey. rhabdovirus genomes contain similar initiation and termination sequences. a nonstructural G protein (G NS) is believed to have been generated by homologous gene duplication in an ancestral rhabdovirus. NS protein does not share characteristics of the protein such as being incorporated into virions or inducing neutralizing antibodies in the host. it is unclear whether U1 and U2 have similar roles to U3 and whether the three proteins act synergistically. the most notable result was the identification of a unique FLAV variant (termed lineage B), which showed 15% nucleotide divergence in U1 to lineage A. both the prototypical FLAV (lineage A) and the variant (lineage B) appear to circulate sympatrically, as they have been repeatedly isolated together from the same county (i.e., Lowndes) over a 6-year period (2005\u20132010) melanura Suffolk New York 1961 A KF028661 C182 Agelains phoeniceus Unknown Unknown 1963 A KF028675 Ar 228-74 Culex (Cx.) restuans Unknown Connecticut 1974 A KF028663 Ar 274-74 Cs. melanuraa Unknown Connecticut 1974 A KF028676 Ar 46-84 Cx. restuans/Cs. melanuraa Unknown Connecticut 1984 A KF028673 RI quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2004 A KF028731 CHC 1216-04 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2004 A KF028762 CHC 1256-04 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2004 A KF028755 CHC 1315-04 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2004 A KF028743 FTN 133-04 Cx. quinquefa quinquefasciatus Harris Texas 2005 A KF028716 M 10567 Cx. quinquefasciatus Harris Texas 2005 A KF028716 M 13419 Cx. quinquefasciatus Harris Texas 2005 A KF028764 M 13419 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2006 A KF028759 CHC 348-06 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chat quinquefasciatus Harris Texas 2006 A KF028721 CHC 121-07 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2007 A KF028711 CHC 452-07 Cx. quinquefasciatus Chatham Georgia 2007 A KF028708 CHC 522-07 Cx. quinquefasciatus Fulton Georgia 2007 A KF028707 FTN 13-07 Cx. quinquefa quinquefasciatus DeKalb Georgia 2008 A KF028758 DKB 270-08 Cx. quinquefasciatus DeKalb Georgia 2008 A KF028732 LWN 167-08 Cx. quinquefasciatus Lowndes Georgia 2008 B KF028733 LWN 241-08 Cx. quinquefasciatus Lowndes Georgia 2008 B KF028736 LWN 325-08 restuans DeKalb Georgia 2009 A KF028750 DKB 74-09 Cx. restuans DeKalb Georgia 2009 A KF028746 FTN 11-09 Cx. spp. Fulton Georgia 2009 A KF028754 LWN 414-09 Cx. quinquefasciatus Lowndes Georgia 2009 A KF028752 LWN 661-09 Cx. quinquefasciatus lowndes Georgia 2009 B 103 U1 nucleotide sequences of FLAV depicting the two main viral lineages (A) and (B) are shown in bold italics. all horizontal branches are scaled according to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. phylogenetic analysis of the U1 sequences was notable for the marked absence of temporal structure. a variety of methods (CDC light traps, gravid traps) were identified to the species level (when possible) and stored at 80 \u00b0C until further processing. wells exhibiting cytopathology were harvested and RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. a small number of avian isolates of FLAV were included in the analysis. all pseudogene 1 (U1) sequences used in phylogenetic analysis have been submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers KF028671\u2013KF028763. cDNA products of the transcripts of the pseudogene region were generated using an oligo(dT) primer and gene-specific primers based on the 5\u2032-terminal mRNA sequence. proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE in a 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gel. membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween and probed using a 1:100 dilution of FLAV MHIAF and a 1:2000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse IgG.

Archived FLAV isolates from 1961 to 1999 were obtained from WRCEVA. all pseudogene 1 (U1) sequences used in phylogenetic analysis have been submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers KF028671\u2013KF028763. cDNA products of the transcripts of the pseudogene region were generated using an oligo(dT) primer and gene-specific primers based on the 5\u2032-terminal mRNA sequence. the membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween and probed using a 1:100 dilution of FLAV MHIAF and a 1:2000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) HRP conjugate. viral proteins were estimated against a SuperSignalTM Molecular Weight Protein Ladder (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) a 20\u201360% sucrose gradient in a Beckman SW 32 Ti rotor was recovered. the gel was stained with a SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain. peptides were pooled, evaporated in a Speedvac SC110. proteins identified by MS/MS were filtered with false discovery rate of detected tryptic peptides at 1%. phylogenetic tree was inferred for 103 U1 gene sequences (511 nt) of FLAV isolates sampled across the eastern United States. a broad-scale analysis of selection pressures was undertaken by estimating the numbers of synonymous (d S) and nonsynonymous (d N) nucleotide substitutions per site (ratio d N/d S) using the single likelihood ancestor Counting method available at the Datamonkey webserver (Delport et al., 2010)."}
