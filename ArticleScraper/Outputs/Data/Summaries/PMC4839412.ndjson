Zika virus is the only vector-borne virus in our dataset where onward human transmission may not involve the usual zoonotic cycle because sexual transmission has been reported. the distinction between DNA and RNA genomes is only a weak predictor of the likelihood of establishing human-to-human transmission. a similar confounding association is that all of the segmented viruses in our dataset develop acute infections. nonenveloped viruses were more likely to establish human-to-human transmission than enveloped viruses. recombination rates vary extensively among RNA viruses, from seemingly clonal in nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses to per site rates that are greater than that of mutation in the case of HIV-1. recombination has the potential to facilitate transmissibility by accelerating the rate at which advantageous genetic combinations are produced compared with mutation alone."}
