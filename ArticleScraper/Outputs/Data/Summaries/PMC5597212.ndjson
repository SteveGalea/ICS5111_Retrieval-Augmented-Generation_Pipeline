{"summary": "EV-D68 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, and species Enterovirus D. EV-D68 was first isolated in the us in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchitis. EV-D68 was then rarely reported until the early 2000s. this is the first report of longitudinal surveillance of EV-D68 in children with ARIs in a limited geographic area in a limited geographic area in Japan since the 2010 epidemic. this is the first report of longitudinal surveillance of EV-D68 in children with ARIs in a limited geographic area in a limited geographic area in each of these years. cDNA was synthesized using a kit (QuantiTect Multiplex PCR; Qiagen Inc.) multiplex real-time PCR was performed using a kit (QuantiTect Multiplex PCR; Qiagen Inc.) to detect 19 viruses or subtypes of viruses, including human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (A, B), human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human EV-D68 genome sequence determination. cDNA was synthesized using primers (random hexamer or sequence-specific) and SuperScript III. PCR was performed using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc.) phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. sequences at nucleotide positions 501\u20131000 were aligned in MEGA 7.0. 310 respiratory specimens were collected from hospitals and clinics from April to December 2015. multiplex real-time PCR was performed using a kit (QuantiTect Multiplex PCR; Qiagen Inc.) to detect 19 viruses or subtypes of viruses, including human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (A, B), human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134. PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing, and EV-D68 was identified by phylogenetic analysis. cDNA was synthesized using primers (random hexamer or sequence-specific) and SuperScript III. EV-D68 genomes were amplified in nine fragments using the primers shown in S1 Table. 89\u20133,315 of the Fermon strain were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. sequences at nucleotide positions 501\u20131000 were aligned in MEGA 7.0. the unbroken line represents the number of specimens collected per month. patients 2 years of age accounted for 55.6% of all EV-D68-positive cases in the study. cheal aspirate 0 y 4 m M Viral bronchitis, respiratory failure 2013/9/30 Rhinovirus A Complete genome 1\u20137341 LC068709 2 726-OsakaC-JPN-2013 Nasal mucus 2 y 0 m M Asthmatic bronchitis 2013/10/8 Adenovirus A Complete genome 1\u20137341 LC068710 3 727-OsakaC-JPN-2013 Nasal VP1 NR** NR** 10 744-OsakaC-JPN-2015 Nasal mucus 1 y 7 m F Asthmatic bronchitis 2015/10/5 B (Subclade B3) Complete VP1 927 LC107890 11 759-OsakaC-JPN-2015 Nasal mucus 3 y 8 m F Asthmatic bronchitis 2015/10/5 B (Subclade B3) Complete VP1 927 complete genome 1\u20137110 LC107901 18 A274-OsakaC-JPN-2015 Throat swab 0 y 10 m M Bronchial asthma 2015/10/19 B (Subclade B3) Complete VP1 927 LC107894 19 200-OsakaC-JPN-2010 Nasal mucus 4 y M Bronchitis 2010/6/4 C Complete VP1 927 AB601872 20 290-O 927 AB601876 27 445-OsakaC-JPN-2010 Sputum 4 y 1 m M Asthmatic bronchitis 2010/8/1 C Complete VP1 927 AB601877 28 471-OsakaC-JPN-2010 Nasal mucus 1 y 6 m M Bronchial pneumonia 2010/8/5 C Partial VP1 NR** NR** 30 573-OsakaC-JPN-2010 Nasal complete genome 1\u20137196 LC107889 36 A166-OsakaC-JPN-2015 Throat swab 1 y 10 m F Rash 2015/7/10 Human coronavirus OC43 ND* Partial VP1 NR** NR** 37 A241-OsakaC-JPN-2015 Throat swab 0 y 2 m F Fever 2015/9/7 B (Subclade B3) Nearly gamma distributed with invariant sites (G+I) model was used. numbers at nodes, which indicate bootstrap support values (>85%), are shown. the scale bar shows the genetic distance. phylogenetic analysis of complete or near-complete genome sequences of EV-D68 strains from Osaka showed that these strains belonged to three distinct clades (A, B, and C). Specifically, Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015 clustered into Clades C, A, and B (Subclade B3). 68 bootstrap pseudoreplicates were used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogram. the phylogenetic tree was constructed and evaluated with 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates using MEGA 7.0 software. sequences in GenBank were also included in the analysis. a partial sequence (nucleotide positions 671\u2013740 of Fermon strain) is shown. a partial sequence (nucleotide positions 671\u2013740 of Fermon strain) is shown. EV-D68 was detected from June to October (summer to autumn) in 2010, 2013, and 2015, but not in 2014. in all, 18 EV-D68 strains were detected (n = 4, 2.8% in 2013; n = 1, 0.4% in 2014; and n = 13, 1.9% in 2015). of the 18 EV-D68-positive patients, 15 (83.3%) were positive for EV-D68 alone. in the remaining three patients, co-infections of EV-D68 were identified.

Clade names were assigned according to earlier report [11]. 86.8\u201387.8% (nt) and 94.1\u201395.1% (aa) between strains obtained in 2013 and 2015. VP1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Osaka strains detected in 2015 showed high similarities both in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. lower similarities were observed between strains detected in different years. phylogenetic analysis of EV-D68 strains from Osaka showed that these strains belonged to three distinct clades (A, B, and C) Specifically, Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015 clustered into Clades C, A, and B (Subclade B3). this genogrouping was similar to that based on the VP1 analysis (Fig 2). one amino acid deletion (N692) was observed in the DE loop in Clade A and Clade D. a two-amino-acid insertion (arginine\u2014leucine) was also observed. specific amino acid differences were also observed in the BC and DE loops. nucleotide sequences were aligned in MEGA 7.0. a partial sequence (nucleotide positions 671\u2013740 of Fermon strain) is shown. EV-D68 is believed to be a cause of ARI in at least 15 of these cases. multi-year studies on EV-D68 suggest that the EV-D68 epidemic season differs by country. peak seasons of august\u2014January in China [23], July\u2014December in Australia [24], October\u2014December in Germany [25], and July\u2014October in the Netherlands [26], and variable seasons in Thailand and Hong Kong [15, 27]. data from a multi-year study conducted worldwide are needed to precisely define EV-D68 seasonality. some amino acid changes and deletions in the BC and DE loops of the VP1 protein were observed between the clades of EV-D68. characteristic amino acid substitutions were observed in a comparison of strains in subclades of the same clade. strain CA/AFP/11-1767 reported intersubclade recombination events in the VP2 region between EV-D68 strains in clades B1 and B2 in 2015. however, no intersubclade recombination was observed in EV-D68 strains from Osaka City in 2015 (data not shown) four EV-D68-positive patients without signs of ARI were also found. these patients showed AFP (n = 1 in 2013), unknown fever ( the presence of strains in distinct lineages of EV-D68 in 2010, 2013, and 2015 might have contributed to the re-emergence of EV-D68 in this limited region because of lack of herd immunity. a novel genetic lineage of Subclade B3 was identified that now includes 2015 Osaka strains."}
