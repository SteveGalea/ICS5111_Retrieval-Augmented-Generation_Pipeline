{"summary": "this study evaluates the impact of the 2001 bioterrorist anthrax attack on hospital discharge rate patterns in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) the study was used to identify, quantify, and evaluate the magnitude and direction of this event in a specific period. four of the 33 urgent recommendations address specific issues faced by hospitals during a biothreat. Fox (1996) evaluated the impact of a natural disaster on a hospital. he found an immediate and sustained effect on hospital utilization from this category 4 storm. the average number of admissions increased by two patients per day for approximately two years. juster et al. (2007) used ITSA to analyze hospital admission rates for myocardial infarctions after a statewide smoking ban in public buildings was instituted in new york. this study was patterned after the methods used in the Juster et al. (2007) study and the SARS pandemic research. the index patient was admitted to a hospital with severe respiratory distress. the index case was a 63-year-old male photo editor for a national tabloid newspaper. tens of thousands of people evaluated for anthrax, with 22 confirmed cases, this occurrence did not significantly stress inpatient surge capacity because it was relatively small. many government officials and health professionals assert investments made in the public health infrastructure will benefit the bioterrorism preparedness response efforts. the design of an ITSA helps control for confounding, secular trends, and regression to the mean. the format is similar to a pre-post design, but it has the added benefit of multiple data points both before and after the event. data for this study consisted of county-level, age-adjusted quarterly inpatient discharge rates from the Florida MSA over a 21-year period (1988\u20132008) cases were identified by the principal diagnosis using ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes. the 56th quarter of the time series includes October 2001 and is the quarter of interest. the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was the first analytics method used. a disease cluster is defined as an unusual grouping of instances of a particular disease or condition that is grouped together in time and place. the basic formula for segmented regression, described by McDowall (1980),56 is Yt = b0 + b1T + b2D + b3P + et where T, D, and P are the independent variables of time (T) of the entire series. the dummy variable for pre- and post-event periods (D), coded 0 for the pre-event period and 1 for the post-event period, and the time since the event (P the second characteristic, duration, is identified as either temporary or permanent. the duration can also be construed as the recovery phase of a disaster. the previously cited SARS studies indicated that a pulse function was seen in the SARS pandemic of 2003. the slope, b1, is the rate of change prior to the event. in this analysis, there was a slight upward slope (b1) of 0.11 percent that was statistically significant. the last coefficient, b3, is the change in the slope from before to after the event. ITSA-ARIMA could not be calculated because of a lack of serial dependency due to a lack of data granularity. the yearly quarter format of the data was too large a time frame and lacked sufficient data granularity to identify any details and adequately assess the changes that may have occurred. study demonstrates that the granularity of time frames is as important as the number of data points in the time series. small-scale or shorter-duration events (hurricanes, bioterrorism, tornadoes) may require the smallest level of granularity, such as daily rates. studies of larger-scaled, longer-lasting events may be able to use weekly or monthly rates. inhalation anthrax pneumonia and anthrax bacteria codes were not sequenced as principal diagnoses per official coding guidelines. the bacterial code for pulmonary anthrax is required to precede the code for pneumonia in anthrax to identify the cause of the pneumonia. the record of the index case did specify the 484.5 ICD-9-CM pneumonia in anthrax code, but it was sequenced as the third diagnosis. the required anthrax bacteria ICD-9-CM code (022.8) should have preceded the meningitis code as the causative organism code. clinical documentation improvement (CDI) activities are even more important because of the increased level of specificity now required. ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system provides more extensive data granularity to better identify specific disease mechanisms. the best practice of using encoder software to assign diagnostic and procedural codes would achieve many of the CDI objectives. small outbreaks must be evaluated properly to determine best practices. there may have been significant differences between inpatient and outpatient activity. there were 52 hospitals in the MSA that may have had considerable differences between physicians, available services, and treatment protocols. ITSA can be an effective method to forecast healthcare utilization, both inpatient and outpatient. the lack of time/data granularity prevented the various methods from identifying statistically significant results to accurately measure the impact of Amerithrax. a bright future awaits HIIM professionals with strong data analytics skills. it is essential that civic leaders, public health, and emergency management professionals have tools to plan for, mitigate and evaluate the impact of all hazards and disasters on a specified population."}
