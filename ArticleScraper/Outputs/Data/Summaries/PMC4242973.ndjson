{"summary": "the most logical and cost-effective strategy to protect the human population from these emerging viral diseases is through immunization. whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines represent an ideal strategy for this purpose. however, formalin treatment has several crucial limitations. a novel method for pathogen inactivation using visible ultrashort pulsed (USP) lasers has been reported (Ref. 14) a novel method for pathogen inactivation using visible ultrashort pulsed (USP) lasers inactivates viruses through a physical mechanism: the impulsive stimulated Raman scattering process. mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland) mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment at Johns Hopkins University. phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was stored in aliquots at 80 \u00b0 C. the virus was added in 10-fold dilutions using infection media. TCID 50 / ml virus had a volume of about 200 l. the typical exposure time of the sample to laser irradiation was about 8 h. the diameter of the laser beam was approximately 100 m within the cuvette. mice were sacrificed and their splenocytes were isolated and stimulated using influenza nucleoprotein peptide (NP) the cells were incubated for overnight with 1 g / ml of GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen) after washing with FACScan buffer, the cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a. a constant H1N1 concentration of 1.75 10 5 TCID 50 / well was used for each plate. the virus and serum were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 hours. the plates were stored in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. d rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody washed six times. 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA was used as a substrate for color development. color development was stopped with 1 M H 2 SO 4. the virus was first grown in MDCK host cells. after centrifugation at 1900 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, cell debris was removed. the remaining virus particles were then concentrated by centrifugation at 118,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C through a 20% sucrose cushion in phosphate buffered saline. a magnetic stirrer was set up so that virions would enter the laser-focused volume. all the laser-irradiated influenza samples contained approximately 2 10 8 TCID 50 / ml virus. the typical exposure time of the sample to laser irradiation was about 8 h. two weeks after the last vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of H1N1. the weight of the mice was daily monitored. mice losing more than 25% of their body weight were considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were euthanized. 2 10 4 MDCK cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. a constant H1N1 concentration of 1.75 10 5 TCID 50 / well was used. the plates were stored for three nights in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. the plate was washed six times, and then 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA was used as a substrate for color development. the absorbance of the ELISA plate wells was then determined with a standard ELISA reader at 450 nm. hemagglutination activity of live and ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser-inactivated influenza virus with A/PR/8/34 strain was not affected by the USP laser irradiation. the results provide evidence that the USP laser irradiation causes the least structural changes to viral surface proteins. vaccinated mice showed a 10-fold increase in the percentage of activated NP peptide-specific T cells in comparison to the control mice. vaccinated mice showed a 10-fold increase in the percentage of activated NP peptide-specific T cells in comparison to the control mice. the splenocytes were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur with CellQuest software. the upper right-hand quadrant shows the percentage of NP-specific, IFN- secreting CD 8 + T cells among lymphocytes. serum were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h and then added to the 96-well plate with MDCK cells. plates were stored for three nights in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. radiation are potent inducers of carbonyl groups in protein. 4,10,11,27 these carbonyl groups are in turn inducers of harmful and undesirable T helper type 2 responses. untreated BSA or UV-treated BSA served as negative and positive controls. hemagglutination activity of live and ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser-inactivated influenza virus with A/PR/8/34 strain was not affected by the USP laser irradiation. the results provide evidence that the USP laser irradiation causes the least structural changes to viral surface proteins. mice were challenged with a lethal dose of 6 10 2 TCID 50 / mL of influenza virus. each point represents the mean and bars represent standard deviation. vaccinated mice show a 10-fold increase in the percentage of activated NP peptide-specific T cells. the upper right-hand quadrant shows the percentage of NP-specific, IFN- secreting CD 8 + T cells among lymphocytes. sera from mice that received laser-inactivated vaccination showed a significantly higher neutralizing antibody titer compared to sera from control mice. the plates were stored for three nights in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. the presence of neutralizing antibodies was determined by cell survival. the presence of neutralizing antibodies was determined by cell survival. carbonyl concentrations in untreated BSA, USP laser-treated BSA, or UV-treated BSA were assessed using a colorimetric 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-based assay kit. the carbonyl content of the UV-treated BSA was dramatically increased relative to both untreated and laser-treated BSAs. the number of UVC photons at 208 nm generated under our experimental conditions was estimated to be of the order of 0.1/ second. because the laser exposure time is 8 h, the number of generated UVC photons is about 3000 for the total laser exposure time. on the other hand, the total number of H1N1 viral particles in the laser-irradiated sample is about 200 million. the excited amplitude of vibration on the capsid can become extremely large. this leads to the breaking of weak links such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts in the capsid of the virus. the virus becomes inactivated because of the loss of integrity of its capsid. two control groups of mice got conventional formalin-inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine at 2.76 10 6 pfu / dose. the mice of the control group in Fig. 6(a) all died 10 days after challenging. the mice of the control group in Fig. 6(b) achieved 75% protection. inactivated vaccine significantly more efficient than conventional formalin-inactivated vaccine. one control group vaccinated with two doses of conventional formalin-inactivated vaccine at 2.76 10 6 pfu / dose. the other control group vaccinated with two doses of conventional formalin-inactivated H1N1 vaccine at 2.76 10 6 pfu / dose. splenocytes from vaccinated mice showed a 10-fold increase of influenza NP-specific CTLs compared to unvaccinated mice. the presence of carbonyl groups in vaccine antigens has been linked to the induction of undesirable and potentially deleterious Th2-mediated immunopathology. the future of pathogen inactivation technologies will favor chemical-free methods that target properties specific to pathogens while preserving desirable components of the treated product, leading to improved safety profiles."}
