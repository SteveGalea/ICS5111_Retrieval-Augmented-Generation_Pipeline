{"summary": "Flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is a common fish species within the aquaculture industry in the north of china. the use of vaccines for disease prevention in the flounder population is considered the most acceptable method for aquaculture. work from our laboratory has previously demonstrated variations in T lymphocyte subsets following Hirame novirhabdovirus (HIRRV) infection and immunization (14). effective vaccines result in the production of antibodies and induction of sIgM+ B lymphocytes (15). the amplified VAA gene was digested with Kpn I and EcoR I. then integrated into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid, resulting in the pVAA plasmid. the DNA vaccine plasmid was extracted using an EndoFree plasmid Kit. rVAA protein was expressed and purified from E. coli, before being used for polyclonal antibody production in mice. antiserum specifically bound the purified rVAA, confirming specificity of produced polyclonal antibodies. the bacteria were cultured at 37\u00b0C with Luria Bertani (LB) medium for 12 h. they were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 5 min. they were then used for challenge and in ELISA at a concentration of 1.0 107 CFU/ml. nine fish were randomly sampled in each group at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 28 post-immunization. the lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood, spleen, and head kidney. for serum isolation, blood was sampled from the caudal veins (N = 3). non-specific binding was blocked with 3% (v/v) BSA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. slides were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with mouse anti-rVAA antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed again before being mounted onto slides. microscope slides were washed 3 times with PBS and mounted in antifade solution. rpoS was selected as target gene and qPCR carried out as described previously. bacterial DNA (10 g) was extracted from 2.0 108 CFU of V. anguillarum. the logarithm of V. anguillarum load was calculated following the linear equation: Y = A X B ( A : slope ; B : intercept) the whole genome was extracted from the tissues of analysis (0.1 g) using the TIANamp DNA Kit. cells isolated from peripheral blood, spleen, and head kidney were counted and adjusted to 1 106 cells/ml, then incubated with mouse anti-IgM monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with goat-anti-mouse Ig-FITC (1:256 diluted in PBS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) 106 CFU V. anguillarum or 10 g rVAA per well were coated in 96-well microplates at 4\u00b0C overnight. after blocking with 5% BSA in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, plates were incubated with flgM. rVAA protein was electrophoresed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrically transferred onto poly-vinylidene fluoride membranes. membranes were blocked with 3% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed three times with PBS-T. with xylene and 50% xylene ethanol solution, sections were rehydrated by immersing in a series of 95%, 80%, 70%, 50%, and then 30% ethanol for 4 min each. nuclear structures were stained with hematoxylin for 10 min, differentiated in 0.1% acid alcohol for 45 s, and washed for 30 min with water. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for 15 min, washed in acid ammonia solution for 15 s, and mounted using 60% glycerin. pVAA and pcDNA3.1 treated groups were analyzed by a log-rank test. the sequence of the recombinant plasmid was verified by specific PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. it was then digested with Kpn I and EcoR I to confirm the appropriate insertion of VAA gene into pcDNA3.1. the DNA vaccine plasmid was extracted using an EndoFree plasmid Kit. resulting antiserum specifically bound the purified rVAA. the mouse polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:1000 with PBS. monoclonal antibodies against flounder IgM (FIgM-Mab) were also produced. fish were raised at 21 0.5\u00b0C, fed with food pellets twice a day, and anesthetized with MS-222. fish were sacrificed and bled through the caudal vein prior to the sampling of muscle tissues. for serum isolation, blood was sampled from the caudal veins (N = 3) at days 28 and 35 post-inoculation, and clotted at 4\u00b0C overnight. serum was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min and stored at 20\u00b0C before use. liver, kidney, and spleen were sampled at day 7 post-immunization. the cells were washed three times with PBS, 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, Thermo-Fisher) after washing three times with PBS, 4\u2032, 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, Thermo-Fisher) and mounted onto slides. cells were subsequently incubated with mouse anti-rVAA polyclonal inAE cells were cultured at 24\u00b0C for 48 h before being placed in RNA later reagent (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Baosheng, Dalian, China) and the concentration of RNA measured using a nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher) pVAA- and pcDNA3.1-immunized fish were sampled at day 7 post-challenge. the whole genome was extracted from the tissues of analysis (0.1 g) using the TIANamp DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC. then incubated with fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. cell suspensions were further analyzed using the Accuri C6 cytometer. the plates were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with flgM. after further washing, alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. membranes were blocked with 3% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C. serum from pVAA injected fish at day 35 post-vaccination washed three times. positive bands detected by incubating membranes with prepared substrate solution. slides were dehydrated through gradient ethanol solution, counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin for 45 s, and differentiated in 95% ethanol for 45 s. the slides were dehydrated with two changes of 100% ethanol, cleared in xylene, mounted using neutral balsam, and examined for histological changes. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism5 (GraphPad software, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) all data were expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) differences between pVAA and pcDNA3.1 treated groups were analyzed by a log-rank test. cells were transfected with 500 ng of pVAA or pcDNA3.1 plasmid. they were stained with mouse anti-rVAA antibody and stained with anti-mouse Ig. pVAA Vaccine Induces a T-cell Immune Response T-cell immune responses were also investigated in immunized flounder at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 28 post-immunization. percentage of CD4-1+ T lymphocytes increased significantly at day 7 (p 0.05), peaked on day 11, and declined to the non-treated level at day 28 in peripheral blood. in both spleen and head kidney, the proportion of CD4-2+ T lymphocytes showed a tendency to initially increase followed by a decrease to normal levels. the percentage of sIgM+ B lymphocytes was evaluated by FCM. the fluorescence dot plots indicate the percentage of sIgM+ B lymphocytes from one of the investigated fish at week 5 post-immunization. sera was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by western blot with sera from pVAA immunized fish at day 35 post-vaccination. sera obtained from pcDNA3.1 immunized controls at day 35 was used as a negative control. the results of western blot analysis confirm the ELISA results. the results suggest that rVAA-specific antibodies were induced in flounder by immunization with the pVAA vaccine. the use of the pVAA vaccine promoted the production of specific antibodies and resulted in changes in the percentage of sIgM+ lymphocytes. bacterial burden measured at day 7 post-challenge by investigating rpoS gene concentration in liver, spleen, and head kidney. pVAA vaccine inhibited the histopathological changes in liver of fish. in the liver and spleen tissues from the pVAA vaccinated flounder compared with the pcDNA3.1 injected group. as expected, the rpoS gene wasn't detected in mock challenged fish. the potential ability of the pVAA vaccine to affect the RPS of flounder fish following V. anguillarum infection was evaluated. IFA analysis of HINAE cells transfected with the pVAA showed a green fluorescence specific for VAA protein expression. no fluorescence was detected in pcDNA3.1 transfected cells. pVAA Vaccine Induces a T-cell Immune Response T-cell immune responses were also investigated in immunized flounder at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 28 post-immunization. lymphocytes in peripheral blood, spleen, and head kidney were isolated from the immunized fish. the percentage of CD4-1+ T lymphocytes increased significantly at day 7 (p 0.05), peaked on day 11, and declined to the non-treated level at day 28 in peripheral blood. in both spleen and head kidney, the percentage of CD4-1+ T lymphocytes increased significantly at days 7 and 9 (p 0.05), respectively, and both reached the maximum level at day 14. pVAA Vaccine Elicits Humoral Immune Response The ability of the pVAA to induce functional humoral immune responses was evaluated by means of specific antibody production and sIgM+ B lymphocyte proliferation. western blot analysis of the presence of specific antibodies against rVAA in sera induced by pVAA inoculation. rVAA protein was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel. sera obtained from pcDNA3.1 immunized controls at day 35 post-vaccination was used as a negative control. pVAA Vaccine protects Flounder From V. anguillarum infection. fish sacrificed at day 7 post-challenge, livers, spleens, and head kidneys. pVAA vaccinated fish showed severe lesions in pcDNA3.1 immunized fish. the liver, spleen and head kidney were removed and divided into two sections at day 7 post-challenge. one part of the tissue was fixed and sectioned, for staining with H&E and IHC. the other part was stored in RNA later, total RNA extracted and bacterial load examined by qPCR. the bacterial burden appeared to be significantly lower (p 0.05) in the liver and spleen tissues from the pVAA vaccinated flounder compared with the pcDNA3.1 injected group. as expected, the rpoS gene wasn't detected in mock challenged fish. the potential ability of the pVAA vaccine to affect the RPS of flounder fish following V. anguillarum infection was evaluated. a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed as a potential DNA vaccine for the prevention of flounder fish infection. the recombinant protein emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant was proven to induce a humoral immune response in injected fish, conferring a RPS of 78.38%. the immediate early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) gives the greatest expression of foreign genes (35) transfected fish cell lines are able to express DNA vaccines when instigated by a mammalian promoter (13, 24, 36, 37) new research will involve confirmation of the cell type responsible for rVAA protein production. it is established that following intramuscular administration of a DNA vaccine, the expressed antigens are absorbed, processed, and presented by antigen-presenting cells. cellular studies have confirmed the ability of DNA vaccines to induce a cellular immune response in the control of pathogenic infections (45\u201348) antigen-specific antibodies play a role in neutralizing the effects of bacterial toxins and in opsonizing pathogen for elimination by phagocytosis, to prevent pathogenic infections in fish (61). this opens up the potential of future studies evaluating a possible antigen-specific T-cell response induced by the pVAA DNA vaccine. the size and age of the selected fish were approximately equal. the oxygenation, water temperature, and other rearing conditions were normalized across all tanks. a greater sample population of fish used to evaluate serum antibody titers offers increased accuracy in the determination. the rpoS gene was selected as the target gene for the detection of V. anguillarum in fish (71) the number of V. anguillarum in the tissues of pVAA immunized fish was significantly lower than that of the pcDNA3.1 immunized control group. pVAA conferred protection rates to flounder of 50%, which can be considered moderate. author Contributions JX and HX contributed to the conception and design of this study, performed most of experiments and statistical analysis, drafted and revised the manuscript.
