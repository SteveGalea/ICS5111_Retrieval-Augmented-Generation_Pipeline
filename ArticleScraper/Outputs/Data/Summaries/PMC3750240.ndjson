{"summary": "recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine was developed using the pTRKH2 plasmid, a high-copy-number Escherichia coli-L. recombinant pTRKH2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the Usp45 signal peptide (SPUsp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC) and 14 of the 38 apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (FL) assay. expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (PCR) assay. Clostridium difficile is one of the most important pathogens in nosocomial infections. it causes 10\u201320% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 75% of antibiotic-associated colitis and nearly 100% of pseudomembranous colitis in hospitals. the rate of CDI has been substantially increased in china. recombinant vaccines for C. difficile are thought expensive and inconvenient in storage and transport. recombinant vaccines carried by attenuated S. typhimuriu or V. cholerae are of concern. dieye et al. [8] designed a protein-targeting system for lactic acid bacteria and found that the L. lactis expression system constructed with the P59 promoter and Usp45 single peptide (SPUsp45) was capable of expression and extracellular secretion of target nuclease. the expression system constructed with P59, Usp45, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6) was capable of extracellular secretion previously, we modified the gene expression system to develop recombinant L. lactis live vaccine for C. difficile. we then vaccinated a CDI animal model of golden hamsters by oral immunization. nontoxic tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC) was inserted to the L. lactis expression system as a biological adjuvant. a slight modification was that the nontoxic tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC) was inserted to the L. lactis expression system as a biological adjuvant. the spore-vegetative cell mixture was harvested by flooding each well of the 6-well dish with ice-cold water. after 5 washes with ice-cold water, the mixture of spores and vegetative cells were resuspended in 20%w/v HistoDenz (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) the purified spores were washed twice with ice-cold water to remove traces of HistoDenz and the animal experiment was approved by the Ethics committee of the general hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of People\u2019s Liberation Army. each animal was weighed and then exposed to 4 105CFU C. difficile 4 h after the last administration of CLDM on day 21. the animals were scored based on the observations as follows. the supernatant serum was collected and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the intestinal tract was taken from the animals, with surrounding blood vessels and adipose tissues carefully removed. 100 mg of intestinal tissue was weighed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of TE buffer with trypsin inhibitor. pathological changes in the intestine were observed under a stereoscope and a dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX7, Tokyo, Japan). the tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, HE-stained, and observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan). the criteria for the macropathological score and histopathological score are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. the variance nonhomogeneity was tested by rank sum test. SPSS 13.0 was used for statistical analyses. anti-TcdA serum was added simultaneously with 100 l of 0.22 m-filtered serum. the reaction in all treatments was terminated after 12-hrs incubation. the coverslips were air-dried, embedded with resin, and then examined under a light microscope. FITC and PI signals from stained cells were detected using flow cytometry. intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis was examined by analyzing binding rate of Annexin V-FITC and cells. dead or dying cells were scored by PI signals. gel images were taken using a CCD digital camera. the integral optical density of DNA bands was calculated from the area and intensity of electrophoretic bands using gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 software. CHO-K1 and T84 cells were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China) the two cell lines were respectively cultured in F12 and DMEM-F12 media (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. 0.2M sodium bicarbonate containing 5% casein hydrolyzate and 0.5% glucose. overnight culture broth of C. difficile was diluted in fresh BHIS medium. then 150 ml of diluted culture suspension was spread on 5 ml of BHIS agar dispensed in each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish. samples were taken from plates containing spores and vegetative cells. animal experiment Oral immunization with L. lactis vaccine Thirty-two male golden hamsters with a weight of 100\u2013130 g were purchased from the Slac Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) the golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gastric perfusion of 1 ml suspension of normal saline (control) and L. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector. animals were killed when the score was 4, and the surviving animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment on day 35, i.e., 14 days after Clostridium exposure. the animals were treated with ether for mild anesthesia before sacrificed. skin infection was done with alcohol. ileum to colon tissue was cut into pieces and moderately stirred for 30 min. after centrifugation, the supernatant (intestinal mucus) was collected and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to use. the animals of different treatments were dissected, with abdominal and intestinal lesions examined by naked eye. 0 Mild 1 Medium 2 Severe 3 Mucosal defect No 0 Local 1 Extensive 2 Epidermal cell necrosis, Vacuolization No 0 Mild 1 Medium 2 Severe 3 Recess damage No 0 Mild 1 Medium 2 Severe 3 Mucosal hemorrhage No 0 Mild 1 Medium 2 Severe 3 Evaluation index system and statistical analyses The effect of recombinant L. lactis on C. difficile-in the animal experiment was approved by the Ethics committee of the general hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of People\u2019s Liberation Army. each animal was weighed and then exposed to 4 105CFU C. difficile 4 h after the last administration of CLDM on day 21. the animals were observed 4 times a day on the feces, perianal area, activity, fur morphology, and gloss and mental status. the supernatant serum was collected and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for preparation of intestinal specimens, the intestinal tract was taken from the animals, with surrounding blood vessels and adipose tissues carefully removed. 100 mg of intestinal tissue was weighed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of proteinase inhibitor cocktail. pathological changes in the intestine were observed under a stereoscope and a dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX7, Tokyo, Japan). the tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, HE-stained, and observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan). the criteria for the macropathological score and histopathological score are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. the variance nonhomogeneity was tested by rank sum test. the variance nonhomogeneity was tested by rank sum test. SPSS 13.0 was used for statistical analyses. anti-TcdA serum treatment group added 100 l of 0.22 m-filtered serum. the reaction in all treatments was terminated after 12-hrs incubation. the coverslips were air-dried, embedded with resin, and then examined under a light microscope. FITC and PI signals from cells were detected using flow cytometry. intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis was examined by analyzing binding rate of Annexin V-FITC and cells. dead or dying cells were scored by PI signals. cDNA was extracted from cecum tissue using trizol reagent. gel images were taken using a CCD digital camera. the integral optical density of DNA bands was calculated from the area and the intensity of corresponding electrophoretic bands using gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 software. in the empty plasmid group, animals subject to C. difficile challenge all had light stool and a wet perianal area and tail on day 1 post-challenge. after recombinant L. lactis carrying the secreted-protein plasmid was administered again, diarrhea symptoms were alleviated in the infected animals. all animals in the control group had cecal expansion and intestinal bleeding on day 2. extensive hemorrhagic lesions were observed in the intestine. animals in the control group had mucosal defects, gland destruction, extensive bleeding, submucosal edema, and extensive neutrophil infiltration. animals in the empty plasmid group had less severe mucosal defect, with a small amount of bleeding and extensive neutrophil infiltration in the submucosa. in the membrane-anchored group, animals showed mild damage on the mucosal epithelia post-challenge. in the membrane-anchored group, the animals had slight defects in mucosa post-challenge. in the membrane-anchored group, the animals had slight defects in mucosa post-challenge. the secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower values than the control. there was no significant difference in weight change values between the secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups. L. lactis was isolated from intestinal mucosa homogenates of the 3 immunization groups. C. difficile was detected in intestinal mucosa homogenates of animals in the empty plasmid group. anti-TcdA IgG and IgA antibodies were produced in serum and intestinal fluid specimens of all animals. in membrane-anchored plasmid group, the titers of anti-TcdA IgG and IgA antibodies directed against TcdA were 1.5 104 and 6.7 102 in the serum, and 1.45 104 and 1 102 in the intestinal fluid. anti-toxin A (TcdA) IgG and IgA antibodies in serum of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups was higher than that of the control group (P 0.05). there was no significant difference in anti-TcdA IgA titer of intestinal fluid among all groups. the proportions of dead and apoptotic cells in total cells were significantly smaller in the anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation group. of these, the proportions of dead and apoptotic cells in total cells were significantly smaller in the anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation group than in the TcdA treatment (2 = 83.511, P 0.001) and anti-TcdA serum treatment groups (2=6.125, P 0.05) all hamsters had light stool, wet perianal area and tail, less activity with response to stimuli. few animals had bloody stools as observed by naked eye. majority of animals in the control group had damp claws and lower abdomen. clindamycin-induced CDAD in different groups of hamsters. the rectum had slight lesions, with no feces observed in the colon. empty plasmid group had a non-dilated cecum and uncongested intestinal mucosa. animals sacrificed at the end of the experiment had a non-dilated intestine. animals of the secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had a non-dilated intestine. animals in the control group had mucosal defects, gland destruction, extensive bleeding, submucosal edema, and extensive neutrophil infiltration on day 2. animals in the empty plasmid group had less severe mucosal defect, with a small amount of bleeding and extensive neutrophil infiltration. all animals in the control group had cecal expansion and intestinal bleeding on day 2. the worst lesions were in the top segments of the cecum and colon. the rectum had slight lesions, with no feces observed in the colon. a new tab Macropathological observations in all groups. animals in the control group had mucosal defects, gland destruction, extensive bleeding, submucosal edema, and extensive neutrophil infiltration. macropathological and histopathological scores are higher in the control group than in the 3 immunization groups. of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had obviously lower mortality rate than the empty plasmid group. incidence of diarrhea was significantly different among all groups. C. difficile was detected in diarrhea stools from all animals 1 day post-challenge. in the membrane-anchored plasmid group, C. difficile was detected in the stools of one animal only, but not in its intestinal tissues. lactic acid bacteria or bifidobacteria were not isolated from any groups of hamster. membrane-anchored plasmid group 105 3.9 ab 104 3.45 e 53.75 4.30dc a compared with control group (F=96.289, P=0.000); b compared among immunization groups (F=0.107, P=0.899); d compared among immunization groups (F=0.690, P=0.513); and c compared between days 7 and 14, P 0.01. in the empty plasmid group, the titers of anti-TcdA IgG and IgA were 2.4 103 and 3.6 102 in the serum, and 3.5 103 and 7.5 101 in intestinal fluid. the anti-TcdA IgG titers of hamster serum and intestinal fluid were significantly higher in the secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups. in the serum pre-incubation group, cells became slightly round with visible spindles. in the serum treatment group, some cells turned round and narrow and showed nuclear condensation. some cells remained spindly. expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in hamster PCR assay showed that the mRNA expression levels of mucosal inflammatory cytokines were generally higher in the control and empty plasmid groups. the secreted-protein plasmid group had higher ICAM-1, MCP-1, IL-6, and Gro-1 mRNA expression levels than the membrane-anchored group. the recombinant L. lactis live vaccine is a live ecological preparation for oral immunization of CDI. it contains an increased number of cloning sites, which are commonly used in gene cloning. the modified expression system can be applicable for a variety of bio-engineering purposes. however, its immunization effect on CDI animal model is potentially enhanced. long-term use of antibiotics causes the disturbance of intestinal flora, negatively affecting the inhibitory factors of C. difficile colonization, thereby leading to CDIs. recombinant L. lactis live vaccine has a protective effect on CDI animal model. none of the animals died in secreted-protein plasmid group after the C. difficile challenge. this is because TcdA acts an enterotoxin as well as a cytotoxin, with a lower cytotoxicity than the C. difficile toxin B. in the animal model, no animals had diarrhea symptoms throughout the experiment. the recombinant L. lactis carrying membrane-anchored plasmid is most effective for preventing CDI compared to other immunization treatments. further investigation is guaranteed to explore molecular mechanism(s) of CDI prevention by the recombinant L. lactis live vaccine. administration of 105CFU C. difficile to hamsters after 1-week gavage or intramuscular injection of ceftazidime failed to induce the CDI-associated diarrhea. C. difficile challenge after 2-day administration of CLDM resulted in diarrhea symptoms in the animals. we tested SD rats and BALB/c mice as CDI animal models. despite one dying after the C. difficile challenge, diarrhea symptoms were alleviated in the remaining animals. the probiotic L. lactis has a protective effect on CDI animal model and may prevent C. difficile-associated diarrhea in animals by inhibiting C. difficile colonization. recombinant L. lactis carrying membrane-anchored plasmid most effectively prevented C. difficile-induced diarrhea in the animal model. membrane-anchored plasmid group had higher tilter of anti-TcdA IgG antibody in the serum and intestinal fluid (Figure 7) membrane-anchored plasmid group had downregulated expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6.
