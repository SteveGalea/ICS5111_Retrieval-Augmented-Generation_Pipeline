{"summary": "the first Korean MERS case was identified in a 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East. a total of 186 confirmed cases have been reported in Korea since may 20, 2015. the KSLM MERS-CoV Laboratory Response Task Force (LR-TF) was required in the unexperienced situation of the nationwide outbreak. the case definitions of the US CDC are used to classify patients who should be evaluated for MERS-CoV infection in consultation with state and local health departments. the following case definitions are for classification and reporting to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) a probable case can be defined as a suspect case with negative, indeterminate, or equivocal rRT-PCR results. an individual with preliminary positive rRT-PCR results from clinical laboratories can be defined as a probable case. rRT-PCR is the method of choice for laboratory confirmation. the KSLM MERS-CoV LR-TF members agree that a case definition for a \"probable case\" is needed. a probable case can be defined as a suspect case with negative, indeterminate, or equivocal rRT-PCR results. repeat testing for MERS-CoV is recommended for probable cases. lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage are preferred for the detection of MERS-CoV. however, collection of upper respiratory specimens is guided that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal walls, respectively, not just from the nostril or mouth. nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab should be placed in the same vial to increase viral load. swabs specifically designed for viral testing should be used (flocked synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shaft) calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts should be avoided. serological testing can be used to identify confirmed MERS cases. SPECIMEN PACKING AND TRANSPORT Double package systems can be used for transportation within an institution. all specimens must be packaged in a leak-proof plastic primary container with a screw cap. all specimens must be packed in double containers for transfer. RNA samples should be stored at -70\u00b0C or lower after 72 hr. rRT-PCR is recommended for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV. rRT-PCR assay should be used with provision of positive control and validation by LR-TF. each run of rRT-PCR reaction should include both positive and negative controls in parallel. negative reactions indicate failure of the amplification process. laboratory work and rRT-PCR analysis should be conducted in clinical laboratories with BSL-2 facilities. appropriate PPE should be worn, and all technical procedures should be performed in a way that minimizes the formation of aerosols and droplets. after completion of daily work, the workspace is cleaned with 70% alcohol. in cooperation with public and private sectors."}
