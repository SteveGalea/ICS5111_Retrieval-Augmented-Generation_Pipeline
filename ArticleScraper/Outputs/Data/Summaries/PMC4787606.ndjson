{"summary": "METHODS Patients and Study Criteria Patients presented to 2 tertiary care hospitals over an 18-month period between September 2012 and February 2014. inclusion criteria included adult (aged 18 years); LRT specimen obtained within 48 hours of admission to the hospital; new radiographic infiltrate as determined by radiologist or consultant respiratory physician. specimens with any named bacterial species identified by culture were considered culture positive. samples were centrifuged, and mucopurulent material was stored at 80\u00b0C for up to 15 months. quantitative real-time PCR for GAPDH human gene and qualitative real-time PCR for gB phocine herpes virus internal control were carried out on all specimens [33] quantitative results were accepted if the internal control quantification cycle (Cq) value fell within the range 1 log Cq difference to negative extraction controls. a combined outcome measure of 30-day mortality and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission was used because of the infrequent occurrence of either event in our cohort. data were analyzed using StatsDirect software, version 2.8 0 (Altrincham, United Kingdom) clinical data including comorbidities, outcomes, and antibiotic prescriptions were collected retrospectively from patient hospital records. clinical data including comorbidities, outcomes, and antibiotic prescriptions were collected retrospectively from patient hospital records. x real-time PCR was performed using a combination of multiplex assays developed or adapted in-house for the following 26 pathogens. bacterial loads for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii were expressed as colony forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of purulent material. quantitative results were accepted if the internal control quantification cycle (Cq) value fell within the range 1 log Cq difference to negative extraction controls. outside of this range, quantitative results were not accepted due to the potential for partial PCR inhibition leading to inaccuracy of measurement.

PCR detected significantly more H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae than standard culture-based methods. significantly, PCR was able to detect bacteria in 143 culture-negative specimens. bacterial load of S. pneumoniae was associated with outcome on univariate analysis. a higher load present in patients with 30-day mortality and/or ICU admission. but the CURB-65 score was also associated with outcome on univariate analysis. estimates of impact on antimicrobial precribing records were available for 99.1% (n = 320) of patients. Molecular testing had the potential to lead to de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of initial empirical antibiotic agents in 247 (77.2%) patients, escalation in number and/or spectrum of antibiotic agents in 19 (5.9%) patients. majority of potential de-escalation events were related to switching of amoxicillin-clavulanate to narrower-spectrum agents a total of 323 hospitalized adult patients with CAP were included in the study cohort. 55% were male and the median age was 67 years. the median age was 67 years. 83 (26.3) 2 84 (26.6) 3 56 (17.7) 4 19 (6.0) 5 1 (0.3) Pneumonia severity index classc 1 46 (21.2) 2 9 (4.2) 3 18 (8.3) 4 78 (35.9) 5 66 (30.4) Admission C-reactive protein, mg/L (interquartile range) a cutoff of 105 CFU/mL was applied for assays where bacterial load was quantified. overall pathogen detection by molecular testing rose to 86.7% (n = 280; Table 2). H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the most frequently identified bacteria in patients with CAP, detected in 130 (40.2%) and 115 (35.6%) patients.

PCR is able to detect dead as well as viable bacteria. it is not clear for how long bacterial loads might be detectable after initiation of appropriate antibiotics in patients with CAP. a recent review has noted interventions to reduce excessive and increase effective antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients can have a positive impact on antimicrobial resistance.
