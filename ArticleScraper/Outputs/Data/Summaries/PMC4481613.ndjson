{"summary": "study combines data from 2 multicenter prospective cohort studies of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis. the studies used a similar protocol, with one performed in the united states and the other performed in Finland. both studies were performed as part of the multicenter airway research collaboration. nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected 24 hours after a child's arrival on the medical ward or ICU. the child was placed supine, 1 mL of normal saline was instilled into one naris, and mucus was removed by an 8 french suction catheter. the samples were immediately placed on ice within 1 hour of collection and then stored at 80\u00b0C within 24 hours. real-time PCR was used for the detection of DNA pathogens including adenovirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. all real-time PCR assays were tested in duplicate. sample preparation, RNA/DNA extraction, complementary DNA and amplification were performed in separate areas. Statistical analyses Our analyses focused on RSV, the most commonly detected virus in children with severe bronchiolitis. for the primary analysis, we combined CT values from RSV-A with those from RSV-B since the clinical distinction between the two subtypes of RSV was unremarkable. in both models, we used generalized estimating equations to account for patient clustering at the hospital level. we examined the association of RSV genomic load and the primary outcome, modeling the CT value as a continuous variable, in the US and Finnish cohort separately. after confirming a similar association in the both cohorts, we combined the US and Finnish data set and then repeated the analysis by using a more restrictive definition of children with bronchiolitis [6]. the study was conducted at 16 sites across 12 US states during the 2007\u20132010 winter seasons. we enrolled children aged 2 years who were hospitalized for an attending physician's diagnosis of bronchiolitis. all sites used the same collection equipment (Medline Industries, Mundelein, Illinois) and collected the samples 24 hours after a child's arrival on the medical ward or ICU. the child was placed supine, 1 mL of normal saline was instilled into one naris, and mucus was removed by means of an 8 french suction catheter. all real-time PCR assays were tested in duplicate. sample preparation, RNA/DNA extraction, complementary DNA and amplification were performed in separate areas. all PCR runs had extraction and reagent positive and negative controls. in cases in which a subject was coinfected with RSV-A and RSV-B (n = 15), the lowest CT value (indicative of larger viral loads) was used. we compared patient demographic characteristics, medical history, and hospital course, by RSV load status. we repeated the analysis by classifying patients into 4 RSV genomic load groups, using CT values split into quartiles, as follows: 1 (lowest quartile), 25.9; 2, 22.5\u201325.8; 3, 20.2\u201322.4; and 4 (highest quartile), 20.2. RESULTS Patient Characteristics Of 2615 enrolled children with severe bronchiolitis from 19 sites, 1764 had RSV bronchiolitis. of the 1764 children in the analytic cohort, 587 (33%) were categorized into the low RSV genomic load group, 598 (34%) into the intermediate genomic load group, and 579 (33%) into the high genomic load group. Demographic characteristics differed across the genomic load groups. wk 32 29 (5) 18 (3) 20 (4) 32\u201336 83 (14) 103 (17) 95 (16) 37 or full term 453 (77) 465 (78) 453 (78) Is or was breast-fed 378 (64) 386 (65) 377 (65). clinical course of children hospitalized with RSV Bronchiolitis by RSV Genomic Load Tertile Characteristic RSV Genomic Loada P Valueb Low (n = 587) Intermediate (n = 598) High (n = 579) Onset of difficulty breathing, d before hospitalizationc.93 1 141 (24) 135 (23) 136 (24) 1 432 (75) 425 (73) No difficulty 14 (2) 17 (3) 18 (3) Apnea documented in medical record 42 nonrhinovirus Overall 78 (13) 94 (16) 76 (13) Coronavirus (NL-63, HKU1, OC43, 229E) 29 (5) 56 (9) 30 (5).002 Enterovirus 24 (4) 21 (4) 15 (3).36 Influenza virus (type A, type B, 2009 novel H1N1) 2 (1) 2 (1) 0 (0).38 Parainfluenza virus (types 1\u20133) 5 (1) 6 (1) 6 (1).94 Adenovirus 38 (6) a CT tertiles for RSV genomic loads were defined as follows: low, 24.3; intermediate, 20.8\u201324.2; and high, 20.8. c Spearman correlation was also performed with duration of difficulty breathing (P =.98) and LOS (P =.001). f Fifteen children had a LOS of 3 days. the significant association between genomic load and a risk of a LOS of 3 days persisted with the use of the stricter definition of bronchiolitis (n = 1223; Table 3), different categories of RSV genomic load (Table 4), stratification by RSV subtype (Table 5), and in the subgroup of children with sole RSV infection (n = 1219; Table 6). the fitted line represents locally weighted scatterplot smoothed curve. high 1.49 (1.14\u20131.95).003 1.43 (1.03\u20131.99).03 1.36 (.91\u20132.03).14 Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; LOS, length of hospital stay; OR, odds ratio. c Multivariable model controlling for 10 patient-level variables. a Threshold cycle quartiles for RSV genomic loads were defined as follows: 1 (lowest quartile), 25.9; 2, 22.5\u201325.8; 3, 20.2\u201322.4; and 4 (highest quartile), 20.2. a Threshold cycle quartiles for RSV genomic loads were defined as follows. a Threshold cycle quartiles for RSV genomic loads were defined as follows.
