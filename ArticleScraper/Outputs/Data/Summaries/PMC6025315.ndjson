{"summary": "dengue fever (DF) is caused by four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) the major vector is Aedes aegypti, whereas Aedes albopictus acts as a secondary vector. infection by one serotype of DENV induces lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype but only temporary partial immunity to the other three serotypes. the individual heterogeneity has been described in terms of heterogeneous biting, i.e., a given mosquito bites some hosts more than others [14], which was associated with human sex, age, size, pregnancy, defensive behavior, blood type, and variability in human odors. in the biological literature, NBD was used in different transmission dynamics models to explore the influence of transmission heterogeneity. the simulation results showed that the intervention of super-productive containers was substantially more effective in reducing the risk of dengue at higher human densities. in addition, the NBD was also used in dynamics modeling for infectious diseases. figure 2 shows the daily new DF cases and cumulative cases. the data were collected based on the onset date in the case data obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, http://www.chinacdc.cn/). the first reported local DF case occurred on 11 June 2014 followed by sporadic cases until the middle of July; then, the number of cases gradually increased. the SEIR(human)\u2013SEI(vector) compartmental model has been widely used to model the transmission dynamics of a single serotype of DENV. this type of model divides humans into susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed groups and divides mosquitoes into susceptible, exposed and infectious groups. after an incubation period of 4 to 10 days, the patients enter compartment I H and can transmit the virus.

Spillover Effect Heavy rains, which were defined as daily cumulative precipitation greater than 50 mm [31] can wash out a fraction of the immature mosquitoes from their breeding sites. the maximum heavy rain washout fraction, and here, 0 = 0.465 [31] Mortality rate for larva The mortality rate for larva ( L, day 1 ) was temperature and density dependent: f L = ( 1 ) f L, i d e a l 2 L a K L 1 + 2 L a K L 1 + f L, i d e a l, where f L, i d e a l is the ideal mortality rate for larva (day 1 ). development rate of pupae to emerging adults ( f P, day 1 ) was temperature dependent: f P = 24 0.0143 ( T t / 298 ) e 44093.2 R ( 1 298 1 T t ) 1 + e 100261 R ( 1 330.058 1 T t. death rate for adults ( V, day 1 ) was temperature dependent: V = 0.000114 T t 2 0.00427 T t + 0.0639, T 0:"}
