{"summary": "12 infants 6 months of age with severe ARI infection were admitted to 2 hospitals in hanoi. the outbreak investigation was approved by the Scientific Committee of NHP. the 12 hospitalized infants were 2- to 4-months-old. despite mechanical ventilation and administration of intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, 7 patients died and 3 patients recovered (2 were lost to follow up. HRV was detected by RT-PCR in all infants; 2 patients were co-infected with RSV and adenovirus. the visit revealed that several other infants had been hospitalized elsewhere. we tested nasal\u2013pharyngeal swab specimens from all 43 infants (100% 12 months of age) at the control orphanage within 2 weeks of the outbreak. most children in the outbreak orphanage were female (31/43 [72%]. sequences obtained from isolates from the 2 hospitalized infants were closely related to a subclade of cluster A sequences from nonhospitalized infants at the outbreak orphanage. a subclade of cluster A sequences from nonhospitalized infants at the outbreak orphanage formed a distinct subcluster. researchers found that HRV was the main pathogen detected in an outbreak of severe ARI in children living in an orphanage in central Vietnam. findings support recent studies showing that HRV may be associated with severe respiratory tract infection in infants and children (4\u20136) this outbreak investigation has some limitations. only a small number of controls were selected from a single orphanage. the controls were sampled later than the hospitalized patients and children from the outbreak orphanage."}
