{"summary": "researchers evaluated feasibility and potential benefits of a handheld computer based knowledge access system linking a central academic intensive care unit to multiple community-based ICUs. participants generated admission orders during each scenario, which were scored by blinded evaluators. a study evaluating a mobile computerized cart showed that evidence-based medicine was more likely to be incorporated into patient care when the computerized system was used. despite the popularity of handheld devices in medicine, few studies have evaluated the usefulness of this technology. updated information is downloaded to the handheld device from a study server. the devices were equipped with backup software that allowed the content to be rapidly restored in the event of a hardware failure. each participant received a 1-hour training session on the use of the handheld device. survey data were scored on a 7-point scale, in which 'excellent' scored 1 and 'excellent' scored 7. each hospital physician group participated in one focus group meeting. information access Information sources that physicians accessed to make clinical decisions were evaluated during simulated patient care scenarios. admission orders were assigned a score (range 0\u2013100) by a critical care physician (SM) and critical care pharmacist (LB) who were blinded as to whether the physician used the handheld device. the scenario-specific scoring system allocated points for all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. the handheld devices were able to receive literature updates on a regular basis using customized software (IqSync; Infiniq Software, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), which accessed an internet-based server using either a connection via desktop computer or infrared data transfer to a telephone modem. updated information is downloaded to the handheld device from a study server. all handheld devices were equipped with backup software that allowed the content to be rapidly restored in the event of a hardware failure. a qualitative assessment of the system was achieved through surveys and focus group methodology. participants completed surveys at baseline and at the end of the study period to evaluate subjectively the handheld reference system and the individual handheld applications. 'poor' scored 1 and 'excellent' scored 7. the admission orders were assigned a score (range 0\u2013100) by a critical care physician (SM) and critical care pharmacist (LB) who were blinded as to whether the physician used the handheld device. the scenario-specific scoring system allocated points for all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. methanol toxicity, malaria and methemoglobinaemia were simulated. each scenario concluded with the physician writing admission orders for the simulated patient. an audiovisual recording was made of the scenarios for later analysis. regular users accessed the personal information management applications more commonly than the medical software (median 32.8 times/month, IQR 28.3\u2013126.8) than the medical software (median 9/month, IQR 3.7\u201313.7; P = 0.028) participants identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access, and made suggestions for improvement. participants identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access, and made suggestions for improvement. participants identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access. physicians who did not use their handheld device in the final clinical scenarios had similar scores to their baseline scenario scores. an improvement in the final scenario score as compared with the baseline score was noted for those participants who chose to use the handheld device. regular users accessed the personal information management applications more commonly than the medical software (median 32.8 times/month, IQR 28.3\u2013126.8) than the medical software (median 9/month, IQR 3.7\u201313.7; P = 0.028), although significant variation was noted. a total of 13 participants (76%) identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access. participants included the internet (50% of participants; e.g. Medline searches and electronic textbooks), textbooks (43%), telephoning colleagues, the ICU pharmacist or Poison Control Centre (71%), and other sources such as pocket guides. physicians who did not use their handheld device in the final clinical scenarios had similar scores to their baseline scenario scores (median 60.0, IQR 40.0\u201360.0 versus 58.0, IQR 44.5\u201370.5, respectively). a significant improvement in the final scenario score as compared with the baseline score was noted for participants who chose to use the handheld device. the study demonstrates the feasibility of using an electronic knowledge translation system to provide high quality, regularly updated medical reference information from a central academic centre. the lack of universal acceptance of this technology is not surprising and may be due to a number of factors, including inadequate training and lack of familiarity with the technology. study showed the potential role of an updateable handheld information system for knowledge translation in critical care. rapid access to current clinical guidelines may be a valuable component of a comprehensive solution to reducing error and improving efficiency. study demonstrated that an updateable handheld computer information resource is a feasible means for providing point-of-care access to medical reference information in the ICU. author contributions Stephen Lapinsky, Randy Wax, Randy Showalter and Carlos Martinez were responsible for study design.
