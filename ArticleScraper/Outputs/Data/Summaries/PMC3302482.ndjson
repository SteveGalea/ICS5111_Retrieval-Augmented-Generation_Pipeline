{"summary": "viruses have developed molecular tools for efficient hijacking of host cell machinery. they can be used to explore cellular biology pathways such as endocytosis (4), or to study gene and foreign molecule transfer. new stochastic models have been developed to quantify different viral entry stages, starting with the receptor binding at the cell surface, the virus internalization (17\u201319), and the free cytoplasmic trafficking to a nuclear pore (20\u201323). despite the central role of endosomal escape in the viral entry process, our goal here is to develop and analyze a biophysical model. the limiting step is due to the conformational change of at least one VP1 protein. the limiting step is due to the conformational change of at least one VP1 protein. this analysis uses a markov jump process continuous approximation (38) our model predicts that increasing the number of AAV particles in the endosome slightly decreases the viral residence time and its variance. enlarging the endosome-size shall delay the escape process. the optimal number of AAV particles inside an endosome is 3. the active transport of endosomes along microtubules (MTs) is accompanied by a change of the early endosome into a maturing endosome (ME) after a gradual acidification of the endosomal compartment. low-pH-activated proteases bind to viral endosomolytic proteins, triggering their conformational change. probability 1 \u2013 l(X,c)t \u2013 r(X,c)t is proportional to the number of binding sites, l ( x, c) = k 1 x n s, (2) where k1 is the backward rate constant. the mean time for VP1 conformational change corresponds to the mean waiting time to have nT bound sites among ns. when the protease concentration c is fixed, the probability P r x ( t, c ) = y | x ( 0, c ) = x = p ( y, t | x, c ) is a solution of the backward master equation. the first time that a penetration protein is filled up to a critical threshold x T = n T / n s is equal to the first-passage time for x(t,c) to reach the level xT. the mean first-passage time (x,c) is defined as the conditional expectation (x,c) = E[|x(t = 0, c) = x], ( x, c ) = 0 for x = x T Equation 5 links the affinities between the proteases (concentration c) and the binding sites of a single VP1 penetration protein to its conformational change mean time (c) the reciprocal of the time (Eq. 5) is the conformational change rate that has been experimentally measured for a few viruses. the binding of xTns 0.66 9 = 6 sites is sufficient to trigger the activation of the penetration protein. we find that the binding of xTns 0.66 9 = 6 sites is sufficient to trigger the activation of the penetration protein. 1.2 s1, corresponding to the AAV mean residence time e 300 s, is highlighted (shaded dotted line) the escape time distribution is plotted against the proteases number. the viral endosomolytic proteins obtained by our analysis (continuous shaded line) with the sampled experimental data obtained for the Influenza hemagglutinin (27) (solid crosses) protons mostly activate proteases P through a standard first-order chemical reaction (protonation of a single histidine residue), P + H + P H +. y(t) is given by y ( t ) P 0 x ( t ) K (11) and the number of protease activations in the endosome is approximated as Poissonian. the probability Pq(t) of exactly q proteases in the endosome at time t is equal to P q ( t ) = e t ( t ) q q! a protease is activated during time t and t + dt with a rate e t d t. the probability of no conformational changes until a protease is activated is given by 0 p ( t, c ) e t d t. q. 14 reduces to P e 0 ( c ) = 1 0 e t ( c ) e t d t = 1 + ( ( c ). pe(j) is the product of the probabilities that at least one conformational change occurs after exactly j proteases have been activated. v a r ( e ) = 2 2 + 2 2 k = 1 1 i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) + 2 2 j = 1 k i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) + 2 2 j = 1 k i = 1, i j k ( 1 + i / ) = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) = 1 k ( 1 + i / e is a decreasing function of, and for the experimental value e 5 min, we obtain and predict that the protease activation rate is 1.2 s 1. we conclude with our set of parameters that approximately one protease is activated in the endosome per second. the mean escape time e ( v a r ( e) is a decreasing function of the initial number of viruses. precisely when the number of viruses increases from 1 to 10, the mean escape time decays by 35%. it depends nonlinearly on the endosomal size through the protease activation rate. the escape time is overall an increasing function of r. the endosomal size can vary during maturation, changing the endosomal size can affect viral escape. low-pH-activated proteases can bind with a forward binding rate r(X,c) and unbind with a dissociation rate l(X) to viral endosomolytic proteins. the protein conformational change initiates the endosomal lysis. transition probabilities satisfy P r x = | x ( t, c ) = x = r ( x, c ) t, P r x = | x ( t, c ) = x = l ( x, c ) t. when all binding sites are identical, the forward rate r(x,c) is proportional to the number of VP1 free binding sites and to the proteases concentration c in the random first time that a penetration protein is filled up to a critical threshold x T = n T / n s is equal to the first-passage time for x(t,c) to reach the level xT. the mean first-passage time is defined as the conditional. x,c = 1 for x in [ 0, x T ], ( x, c ) = 0 for x = x T and ( x, c ) x = 0 for x = 0. Equation 5 links the affinities between the proteases (concentration c) and the binding sites of a single VP1 penetration protein to its conformational change mean time. we compare the predictions of Eq. 5 to experimental activation rates. but very little is known about the nature of the proteases and their relative affinities to the binding sites of the AAV VP1 penetration proteins. k 1 15 10 3 L. mol 1 s 1, k 1 10 2 L. mol 1 s 1, and x T 0.66 are the different concentrations. the binding of xTns 0.66 9 = 6 sites is sufficient to trigger the activation of the penetration protein. escape time e as a function of the number nv of viruses inside the endosome. we consider that the proteases activation rate is proportional to the endosome. protons pumped into the endosome can bind proteases, such as furins and cathepsins, mostly through protonation of a single histidine residue (29,30) protons mostly activate proteases P through a standard first-order chemical reaction (protonation of a single histidine residue) the probability Pq(t) of exactly q proteases in the endosome at time t is equal to P q ( t ) = e t ( t ) q q!. we will estimate the proteases activation rate from the experimental mean escape time obtained for the AAV: e 5 min. the probability of no conformational changes until a protease is activated is given by 0 p ( t, c ) e t d t. the probability of no conformational changes until a protease is activated is given by 0 p ( t, c ) e t d t. pe(j) is the product of the probabilities that no conformational changes occur between successive proteases activation, until the jth one P e ( j) = ( 1 ( 1 P e 0 ( c ( j) ) n v n P, (17) where c ( i ) = i / ( N A V 0 ) + c 0 is the concentration associated with the activation of i proteases in the endosome the variance is v a r ( e ) = 2 2 + 2 2 k = 1 1 i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) + 2 2 j = 1 k i = 1, i j k ( 1 + i / ) v a r ( e ) = 2 2 j = 1 k i = 1, i j k ( 1 + i / ) v a r e is a decreasing function of, and for the experimental value e 5 min, we obtain and predict that the protease activation rate is 1.2 s 1. we conclude with our set of parameters that approximately one protease is activated in the endosome per second. we find that the variance is v a r ( e) 1 min, (26) indicating that the escape process is reliable. escape time decays by 35%. it depends nonlinearly on the endosomal size through the protease activation rate and the concentration of proteases c through the viral escape rates i, i 0. protons pumped into the endosome can bind proteases, such as furins and cathepsins, mostly through protonation of a single histidine residue (29,30) protons mostly activate proteases P through a standard first-order chemical reaction (protonation of a single histidine residue) the probability Pq(t) of exactly q proteases in the endosome at time t is equal to P q ( t ) = e t ( t ) q q!. the endosomal trafficking stage after endosomal escape lasts 5 min. the probability of no conformational changes until a protease is activated is given by 0 p ( t, c ) e t d t. p ( t, c ) = 1 0 p ( t, c ) e t d t. pe(j) is the product of the probabilities that no conformational changes occur between successive proteases activation, until the jth one P e ( j) = ( 1 ( 1 P e 0 ( c ( i ) ) i = 0 j 1 ( 1 P e 0 ( c ( i ) ) n v n P, (17) where c ( i ) = i / ( N A V 0 the variance is v a r ( e ) = 2 2 + 2 2 k = 1 1 i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) + 2 2 j = 1 k i = 1, i j k ( 1 + i / ) i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) i = 1 k ( 1 + i / ) we find that e is a decreasing function of, and for the experimental value e 5 min, we obtain and predict that the protease activation rate is 1.2 s 1. the variance is v a r ( e ) 1 min, (26) indicating that the escape process is reliable. we study the effect of the endosomal size on the mean escape time e. it depends nonlinearly on the endosomal size through the protease activation rate and the concentration of proteases c through the viral escape rates i, i 0. endosomal size can affect viral escape. we have modeled several steps to quantify the residence time of the viral particle AAV in an endosome. we predict that viruses should preferentially escape in peripheral endosomes, where the size is minimal. analysis provides a general tool to explore the multidimensional parameter space of the endosomal escape from an endosome. it allows us to quantify the mean escape time from an endosome and its dependency with respect to several fundamental parameters such as the endosomal size or the protease activation rate. activation of reovirus penetration proteins involves a multistep conformational change process. low-pH-activated cathepsins have to remove first the intermediate 3 protein leading to the exposure of the penetration protein 1 to other endosomal proteases. a viral particle should stay long enough inside the endosome. a viral particle should stay long enough inside the endosome. the number of viruses inside an endosome modulates the probability Poptimal that they escape in a given range of endosomal proteases. the optimal probability for viruses to escape in the range of 250\u2013350 is then maximal, equal to Poptimal = 0.57. efficiency impacts on the outcome of subsequent stages of viral infection. each stage such as endosomal escape, cytoplasmic trafficking, etc. is rate-limiting. the fitness is, for example, the efficiency of capsid priming in the endosome. we predict that by replacing all VP2 proteins by VP1, the optimal escape probability Poptimal will increase from 0.37 to 0.52. in that case, the viral capsid contains 14 VP1 proteins; however, our model predicts that the optimal escape probability Poptimal is maximal for 23 VP1. the conformational change of a single VP1 penetration protein defines the limiting stage of the AAV egress from the endosome. we have neglected other factors not directly correlated with the endosomal pH, such as the physical disruption of the endosome. activation of reovirus penetration proteins involves multistep conformational change process. low-pH-activated cathepsins have to remove first the intermediate 3 protein leading to the exposure of the penetration protein 1 to other endosomal proteases. a viral particle should stay long enough inside the endosome. escaping below kmin leads to an irreversible degradation. the number of viruses inside an endosome modulates the probability Poptimal that they escape in a given range of endosomal proteases. the optimal probability for viruses to escape in the range of 250\u2013350 is then maximal, equal to Poptimal = 0.57. each stage such as endosomal escape, cytoplasmic trafficking, etc. (denoted by i) is rate-limiting and is quantified by the probability (pi)1i 4 that depends on the fitness (fi)1i 4. the fitness is, for example, the efficiency of capsid priming in the endosome. we predict that by replacing all VP2 proteins by VP1, the optimal escape probability Poptimal, for a single virus, will increase from 0.37 to 0.52."}
