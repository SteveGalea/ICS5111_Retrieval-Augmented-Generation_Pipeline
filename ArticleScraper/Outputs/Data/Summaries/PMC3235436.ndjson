{"summary": "membrane rafts are small (10\u2013200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. the term \u201cmembrane raft\u201d underlies the concept that both proteins and lipids, rather than solely lipid-driven interactions, play an important role in the formation of these membrane microdomains. some RNA viruses, such as Orthomyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and togaviridae family viruses, enter cells through an endocytic pathway. other enveloped viruses allow the viral membrane to fuse directly with the host cell surface membrane. RNA viruses except influenza virus proceed in the cytoplasm. nonenveloped viruses (Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Papovaviridae, Parvoviridae and Reoviridae) are lipid bilayers derived from the host cellular membrane of the cell surface. nonenveloped viruses are generally assembled in the cytoplasm or nucleus and burst into the extracellular environment through membrane destruction from cell death. viruses, such as paramyxoviridae and papovaviridae family viruses, are replicated and transcribed in the cytoplasm. nonenveloped DNA viruses are incorporated into cells through endocytosis. after assembly of viral proteins and genomes, progeny viruses are released from cells. ytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; Arenaviridae) [4], coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Coronaviridae) [5\u201311], Ebola virus (Filoviridae) [12\u201314], Marburg virus (Filoviridae) [12, 15], west Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) [16], dengue human coronavirus enters cells through caveola-dependent endocytosis. virus infection is inhibited by caveola destruction using a cholesterol-removing reagent and an RNAi method for caveolin-1. membrane rafts are not required for virus release process. raft-mediated endocytosis associated with cholesterol is distinctly different from caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis. a viral coreceptor is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-(GPI-) anchored protein within membrane rafts. the severe pathogenesis of these viruses in humans makes studies on the infection mechanism difficult to perform using intact viruses. a nonpathogenic strain of WNV (Sarafend strain) binds to V 3 integrin as a viral receptor. it enters cells through a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. DEN, an important arthropod-borne human pathogen, is clinically manifested from a simple self-limited febrile illness known as dengue fever. the ADE of DEN-4 infection in the human myelomonocyte cell line U937 has been suggested to require membrane rafts. the entry process of JEV, the leading cause of acute encephalitis in south-east Asia, also requires membrane rafts in neural stem/progenitor cells [19, 21], possibly via the putative receptor HSP70 [62] and heparin sulfate [63] like DEN. herpesvirus is a pathogen causing mucosal lesions of the mouth and genital organs in humans. complexes of CD21 with CD19 and palmitoylated CD81 are present in membrane rafts. the association of TNFR with membrane rafts is correlated with protein kinase C alpha (PKC) activation. gB, but not gD, or gH, of HSV-1 is associated with membrane rafts after virus attachment and during virus entry. gB may interact with a cellular molecule within membrane rafts that may serve as a platform for HSV-1 entry and cell signaling. reduced HHV-8 infection and decreased cellular signals associated with the virus infection by raft disruption suggest membrane rafts in microvascular dermal endothelial cells are required for HHV-8 infection. the virus enters host cells through multiple pathways including clathrin-independent endocytosis, caveola-independent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. viral envelope proteins A14, A17L, and D8L, but not H3L, are present in membrane rafts on the cell surface. vaccinia virus binds to viral receptor CD4 on the cell surface by the viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 that confers membrane fusion activity. whereas CXCR4 is almost entirely absent in membrane rafts of human embryonic kidney 293T cells, H9 leukemic T cells and PBMCs. recent research indicates that the viral clustering of coreceptor CXCR4 in membrane rafts on 293T cells, rather than that of the viral receptor CD4, is the key step for the entry process of HIV-1. alphaviruses require cholesterol for the virus entry process and especially for the membrane fusion process between the virus and the endosome triggered by low pH of acidic endosomes. alphaviruses may not require membrane rafts for cholesterol-dependent promotion of fusion. bovine papillomavirus (Papovaviridae) [107], human papillomavirus (HPV; Papovaviridae) [108\u2013116], simian virus 40 (SV40; Papovaviridae) [118\u2013126], bluetongue virus (reoviridae) [127], and Rotavirus (reoviridae) [128\u2013130]. HAdV is a common pathogen of acute respiratory disease and the relationship between activation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) within rafts during infection and virus entry is unclear. coxsackievirus B4 is a human pathogen causing diabetes mellitus. coxsackievirus B3 Nancy strain possessing no ability of DAF binding uses an entry mechanism similar to that of the RD strain in HeLa CCL2 cells. a number of enteroviruses including echovirus type 11 cause nerve paralysis, cerebral meningitis, respiratory symptoms, and anathema. a recent study has suggested that binding of clustered 2 1 integrin with echovirus type 1 initiates a unique entry pathway that is p21-activated kin ninety percent of human Rhinovirus immunogenic variants use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as a receptor [132\u2013134], which is known to be a component of ganglioside GM1-containing membrane rafts. over 100 different types of HPV, including types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68 as high-risk carcinogenic HPVs. remarkably slow entry and initiation of HPV type 31 early infection require both caveolin-1 and dynamin-2 (entry half-time of approximately 14 h) both HPV types 16 and 31 require the acidic compartment of the endosomal pathway, where low pH induces a conformational change in the HPV capsid to promote viral genome uncoating. tetraspanin-enriched microdomains may serve as an entry platform of HPV type 16 and 31. different entry routes for HPV types 16 and 31 may result from different host cell types, such as human keratinocytes, COS-7 cells and 293TT cells. the involvement of distinct endocytic pathways in HPV type-dependent pathogenicity remains unclear. SV40 receptor MHC-I is not localized in membrane rafts, but attachment induces association of the virus with caveola [118\u2013122] or ganglioside GM1 that is enriched in membrane rafts as a viral receptor. bluetongue virus-1 can infect baby hamster kidney cells through an entry process that is clathrin dependent and cholesterol dependent but requires dynamin. the role of membrane rafts in viral RNA synthesis of enveloped viruses has been investigated for hepatitis C virus. a lipophilic long-chain base compound, NA255, has been identified as a small-molecule HCV replication inhibitor from a secondary fungal metabolite. sphingomyelin-hydrolyzed virus has a defect in cellular internalization. incorporation of cholesterol and sphingolipid into HCV particles also plays an important role in virus maturation and infectivity. membrane rafts are associated with the NS1 of all four DEN serotypes and JEV. the role of membrane rafts in virus budding has been investigated. the matrix protein VP40 of Ebola virus plays an essential role in virus assembly and budding. the matrix protein VP40 of Ebola virus oligomerizes in membrane rafts. membrane rafts may be involved in a transport pathway for basolateral destinations of WNV within endothelial cells. MCMV (belonging to the betaherpesvirus UL78 family) M78 protein is rapidly and constitutively internalized through both clathrin-dependent and caveola/raft-dependent pathways. the UL11 and UL51 gene products of HSV are membrane-associated tegument proteins that are incorporated into the HSV envelope during virus maturation. UL11 is associated with cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane rafts through its posttranslational myristoylation and palmitoylation into the Golgi apparatus. HA, NA, NP, and M2 independently use membrane rafts together with each apical targeting signal sequence for the apical sorting process. however, membrane rafts are not necessarily required for apical sorting of these viral proteins. apical sorting machineries of these viral proteins also exist outside their membrane rafts. the role of membrane rafts in the influenza virus lifecycle is contribution to an efficient incorporation of raft-associated viral proteins into the progeny viral membrane and pinchingoff of virus particles from the plasma membrane. a study has shown that membrane raft disruption enhances virus budding from MDCK cells. sulfatide, 3-O-sulfated galactosylceramide, is required for efficient virus replication. association of newly synthesized HA with sulfatide induces nuclear export of viral RNP complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. further investigation is needed to determine whether enhanced nuclear export of viral RNP is triggered by raft-associated or non-raft sulfatide. internal structural proteins, M and N, interact with membrane rafts. lgi network preferentially incorporated into membrane rafts. the nonstructural V protein remains excluded from rafts during virus infection. RSV infection induces cellular distribution of phosphocaveolin-1 that is enriched at sites of attachment of the actin cytoskeleton. the cytoplasmic tail of F protein plays an essential role in its cellular localization and production of infectious progeny viruses, dependently on interaction of F protein with membrane rafts. HIV-1 uses membrane rafts as a platform for viral assembly and budding. gag protein interacts with the plasma membrane through associations between its myristic acids and membrane rafts. lower-ordered Gag multimerization, but not higher-order Gag multimerization, may enhance or stabilize Gag-membrane and Gag-raft interactions. arginine and lysine residues of Nef increase viral transcription and HIV-1 infectivity. the N-terminus of Nef determines its differential membrane avidity. the viral Vpu protein is partitioned into membrane rafts. hA3G inhibits progeny virus particles by its incorporation into virus particles. tetherin counteracts the viral Vpu protein partitioned to membrane rafts. expression of caveolin-1 causes a reduction of virus production in macrophages. tetraspanin-enriched microdomain is a unique type of protein-based microdomain. the role of membrane rafts in intracellular assembly of nonenveloped viruses has been investigated only in bluetongue virus and Rotavirus. the role of membrane rafts in intracellular assembly of nonenveloped viruses has been investigated only in bluetongue virus [216] and Rotavirus [130, 217\u2013220], belonging to the family Reoviridae. membrane microdomains associated with VP4 are significantly dependent on raft heterogeneity of cell lines. membrane rafts act as a scaffold of various cellular signal transductions. membrane rafts are often controlled by membrane rafts in host cells and immune cells. the integrity of membrane rafts and the activation of Src-related Ras/Raf/ERK cascades participate in NF-B activation. signal activations and cytokine expressions caused by JEV infection may play a critical role in neuronal cell death. HHV-8 encodes two RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases (MIR1 and MIR2) that mediate ubiquitination and degradation of cellular proteins important for immune response. function of MIR2 is required for its palmitoylation, which is known as a posttranslational modification that enhances recruitment of transmembrane proteins into membrane rafts. the ability of the E2 protein to attenuate IL-2 and IFN- secretion has been suggested to contribute to a mechanism for HCV to evade the human immune response. antibodies against SARS-CoV spike domain2 (S2) in patient sera can cross-react with human lung epithelial cells through annexin A2. oncoproteins E6 and E7 of high-risk HPV are known to be expressed in cervical cancers by inducing several signal alterations. the additional oncoprotein E5 of high-risk HPV type 16 increases expression and association of both GM1 and caveolin-1, components of membrane rafts. internalization does not affect caveolin expression in FRT cells. pathways of PrPc internalization are dependent on cell type. raft-dependent pathway distinctly differs from caveola-dependent pathway. membrane rafts are not necessarily required for efficient viral replication. membrane raft disruption on host cells facilitates formation and production of progeny virus particles with less infectivity and lower viral components. membrane rafts are not necessarily essential for cellular membrane targeting of viral structural proteins. membrane rafts are not essential for viral life cycles. Viruses take advantage of membrane rafts for more efficiency of virus entry, viral genome replication, and virus particle production. rafts induce many raft-mediated cellular signals which relate to characteristic symptoms of the viral diseases.
