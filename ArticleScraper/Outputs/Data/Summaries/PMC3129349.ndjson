{"summary": "HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.0106 copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr. HBoV was found in 1.5-11.3% of respiratory samples investigated worldwide. some investigators argue that the association between HBoV and respiratory tract diseases remains unproven because of the high rate of codetection of HBoV. conventional PCR reaction mixture consisted of 0.2 pg/L forward and reverse primers, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 U of Taq polymerase, and 3 L of extracted DNA. all the PCR products obtained from positive reactions were sequenced completely to confirm sequence specificity. d vector pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), purified using a QIAprep mini prep kit. serial 10-fold dilutions of the clon-ed plasmid were prepared to generate the standard curves. real-time PCR was performed on specimens positive for HBoV by conventional PCR. 1,926 specimens from 1,815 patients were randomly selected. children aged 5 yr or less constituted 75.3% of the study population. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) obtained from all patients were stored in a viral transport medium. 2.5 mM dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 U of Taq polymerase, and 3 L of extracted DNA in a final volume of 25 L. all the PCR products obtained from positive reactions were sequenced completely to confirm sequence specificity. Detection limit of real-time PCR for HBoV was 1.3103 copies/mL. PCR primers were designed using beacon designer software. the forward primer and reverse primer were targeted at a portion of the HBoV NS-1 gene. plasmid vector pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector was purified using a QIAprep mini prep kit. serial 10-fold dilutions of the clon-ed plasmid were prepared to generate the standard curves. real-time PCR was performed on specimens positive for HBoV by conventional PCR. a total of 1,926 samples of patients with respiratory sym-ptoms were included in the present study. ninety-three (4.8%) samples were found to be positive for HBoV by PCR and subsequent sequencing. the viral load detected in the HBoV-positive samples by using real-time PCR was in the range of 1.3103-4.6109 copies/mL (median, 1.82105 copies/mL) the HBoV-positive cases were categorized in 2 groups: low-viral-load group (viral load 1.0106 copies/mL, N=58) and high-viral-load group (viral load >1.0106 copies/mL, N=35) the high-viral-load group had a significantly higher pulse rate and respiratory rate than the corresponding rates in the low-viral-load group. in cases of patients with less than 10 days of hospital stay, the high-viral-load group had a longer hospital stay than the low-viral-load group did. no significant difference was observed in the viral load between the patients with and without pneumonia. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups by using 1.0106 copies/mL as a threshold value. the frequency of HBoV codetection with other respiratory viruses was 18.3% in the HBoV-positive samples. this difference in the codetection frequency is attributed to the different detection methods. the high association of HBoV with PIV seems to be attributed to the high prevalence of PIV infection in 2006. previous studies have reported that HBoV infection was more prevalent among individuals who had other respiratory viruses [10, 22] a higher detection rate of HBoV was observed in NPAs positive for common respiratory viruses than in those that were negative for the same. but in our study, similar detection rate of HBoV was observed in the samples positive and negative for other respiratory viruses in the R-mix culture. positive patients with infection caused by other respiratory viruses belong to the low-viral-load group."}
