{"summary": "the endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild feline endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula) no seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes. the amplified sequence matched (with 100% identity) the PRV genome. specific DNA from glycoprotein D and E encoding-genes was detected. the detection of PRV in a dead Iberian lynx suggests that the virus may have a negative impact on the survival of endangered lynxes."}
