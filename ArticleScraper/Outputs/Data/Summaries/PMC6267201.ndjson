{"summary": "RNA viruses have the highest mutation rate of all known species, ranging from 104\u2013106 mutations per round of genome replication. this is several orders of magnitude higher than DNA viruses [8] and thousands to tens-of-thousands of times higher than the mutation rates exhibited by bacteria and eukaryotes [10,11] the best strategy for RNA virus survival is to produce a sequence foundation composed of low rolling hills. mutations away from the consensus sequence should not have large, detrimental effects as the sequence space is explored. however, survival is not guaranteed, and the mechanisms that allow for the ubiquity of RNA viruses can also be used against them. work with fidelity variants of RNA viruses suggests error catastrophe can occur without pressure from a nucleoside analog. work with fidelity variants of RNA viruses has been useful in defining the evolutionary precariousness of RNA viruses [23,24,25] there have been inconsistent phenotypes observed in the literature. a viral variant was identified that lowered the overall virus mutation frequency. but only in the presence of Ribavirin [26]. the type of mutations produced were significantly different. the answer likely depends on the purpose of the project. the mutant grew well in vitro, but was consistently outcompeted by the wt virus when passaged together. it was reported that this mutant was attenuated in vivo using poliovirus receptor (PVR) transgenic mice. this was not caused by an inability to grow in these tissues. a large number of fidelity variants have been identified from a diverse group of RNA virus families. the first fidelity mutants were identified similarly to the high-fidelity PV mutant by passaging virus multiple times in the presence of a nucleoside analog, usually Ribavirin. this is a rather laborious process with no guarantee of success, so most fidelity mutants have been identified by rationally targeting conserved residues. over 50 fidelity mutants have been identified and characterized. high-fidelity viruses are resistant to multiple nucleoside analogs. high-fidelity viruses are resistant to multiple nucleoside analogs. low-fidelity mutants incorporate NTPs at a slower rate, but with more mistakes. differences are sometimes severe enough to change the specific infectivity of a virus. fidelity mutants appear to produce 1.5\u20132-fold change in diversity compared to wt virus. fidelity mutants are more attenuated in the mosquito vector than the vertebrate host. fidelity variants are usually more attenuated in the mosquito vector than the vertebrate host, with lower virus titers or almost complete restriction. most fidelity mutants have been identified in the viral RdRp. the only exceptions are the coronavirus (CoV) ExoN mutants. a mutation in the alphavirus helicase gene, nsP2, found to increase fidelity. the PPi leaving group is released (step 5), allowing the cycle to begin again. step 2 and 4 are rate-limiting, so fidelity changes are believed to only alter these two steps. 3R PV mutants are found on the periphery of the RdRp protein. the mutation causes a misalignment of this hydrogen bond to and orient the incoming NTP. low-fidelity H273R PV decreases fidelity by favoring an open state of the RdRp, thus increasing the likelihood of NTP misincorporation. fidelity mutant shed approximately 100-fold less in feces than the wt virus. vaccinated mice produced slightly, but not significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers. a low-fidelity PV mutant, H273R [27], was also found to provide complete protection when used as a vaccine. the low-fidelity mutant was unable to revert to wildtype virulence. despite its low-fidelity genotype, there was no reversion of the mutations. removal of the exoN gene increased the virus mutation frequency by 11.5-fold without harming replication kinetics in vitro. fidelity mutants may behave as kinetic mutants in vivo. fidelity mutants often display lower titers and tissue restriction in vivo. a drop in the virus titer due to slightly slower replication kinetics likely makes the infection easier for the host to control. newer technologies may aid in determining differences between replication. the longer the distance between the coverslip and the magnet, the more efficient the RdRp is at replication. low-fidelity PV H273R also displays an increased number of pause events, which are associated with the incorporation of incorrect NTPs. this suggests that low-fidelity polymerases are prone to stuttering when replicating, which may impact other polymerase-associated events. fidelity mutants exhibit certain trends, like attenuation in one environment versus another. this is not entirely surprising, as RNA virus fitness landscapes are hypothesized to be turbulent. however, assays are repeated, and these commonly show inconsistent fidelity. in a distantly related enterovirus such as HEV71, this is not likely to be the cause of differences in virulence in AG129 mice. however, as PV G64S [33,34] and other fidelity mutants are attenuated in mice with intact IFN, it would therefore be predicted that the HEV71 G64R mutant would also be attenuated in the BALB/c model. Fitzsimmons et al. also reported IM median lethal dose (LD50) values of 1.47 105 PFU for wt PV and 6.81 105 PFU for G64S, a 4.6-fold difference. this suggests that this G64S virus stock was more attenuated than the stocks used during these other in vivo virulence studies. Xiao et al. found that 5-week-old PVR mice infected IM with 107 PFU of the G64S mutant succumbed to infection at identical rates as the wt virus. however, there was no difference in the LD50 values for wt PV versus 5 105 PFU for 5-week-old mice. a study by Xiao et al. hints that PV is able to overcome increased fidelity by using recombination, suggesting that recombination may be playing a compensating role for other fidelity mutants. if so, this is of large concern for vaccine development, as this suggests that only certain human populations would benefit from increased vaccine attenuation granted by fidelity mutant vaccines. V in the initial study compared to more recent papers (5.1 versus 4.4 and 4.4), as well as slightly lower for C483Y (3.6 versus 4.1 and 4.2), suggesting slight fluctuations in both the wt and RdRp mutant stock mutation frequencies can reduce or entirely ablate significant differences in replication fidelity. it would be interesting to determine whether the appearance of this nsP2 mutation in the minority variant population is correlated with decreased virus sequence diversity. fidelity mutants are a virus that produces more or less error when replicating relative to the original virus. the most basic definition of a fidelity mutant is a virus that produces more or less error when replicating relative to the original virus. however, it can be difficult to link specific mutations in the virus to changes in fidelity. the first and most famous RNA virus fidelity variant was discovered by passaging PV in the presence of the nucleoside analog, Ribavirin. the mutant was resistant to multiple nucleoside analogs, and was much slower to revert a sequence necessary for PV guanidine hydrochloride resistance. this mutant was attenuated in vivo using poliovirus receptor (PVR) transgenic mice. high-fidelity genome replication was performed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of passage 3 virus stock followed by high throughput TOPO cloning and sequencing of a fragment of the virus genome. this resulted in the G64S virus population producing a 5.6-fold lower mutation frequency than the wt virus. the first fidelity mutants were identified similarly to the high-fidelity PV mutant by passaging virus multiple times in the presence of a nucleoside analog, usually Ribavirin. over 50 fidelity mutants have been identified and characterized. high-fidelity viruses are resistant to multiple nucleoside analogs. fidelity mutants exhibit significant attenuation in mosquito cells but not vertebrate cells. further work is needed to determine if other fidelity mutants are also attenuated in primary cells. biochemical assay can be used to determine the exact rate of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) addition. fidelity mutants appear to produce 1.5\u20132-fold change in diversity compared to wt virus. differences in diversity appear small, but these alterations have been shown in multiple viruses to translate to significant attenuation in vivo. fidelity mutants are more attenuated in the mosquito vector than the vertebrate host. the only exception is the coronavirus (CoV) ExoN mutants. the ability of these large RNA viruses to persist is credited to the exoN gene. fidelity changes appear to be mediated by alterations in RdRp kinetics and molecular dynamics. changes in fidelity appear to be mediated by alterations in RdRp kinetics. some virus genera still lack a verified RdRp structure. an NTP binds the RdRp, which causes a conformational change \u201c*\u201d (step 2) and activates the RdRp (step 3). the NTP is then added to the RNA chain, leading to another conformational change and translocation of the RNA (step 4). PPi leaving group is released (step 5), allowing the cycle to begin again. high-fidelity vaccines for RNA viruses are of particular interest. but few of the above described fidelity mutants have ever been tested as vaccines. fidelity mutants shed approximately 100-fold less in feces than the wt virus. a low-fidelity version of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate for equine encephalitis virus was identified. this mutant was unable to revert to wildtype virulence even after 10 in vivo passages. despite its low-fidelity genotype, there was no reversion of fidelity-altering mutations during this passaging. fidelity mutants should not be attenuated in vitro because changes in fidelity should not be detrimental to virus replication. the lack of a growth defect is a desirable characteristic for translational research, such as the generation of live attenuated vaccines. magnetic tweezers attach a coverslip to one strand of an approximately 3 kb double-stranded RNA molecule and a magnetic bead to the other. the longer the distance between the coverslip and the magnet, the more efficient the RdRp is at replication. this suggests that low-fidelity polymerases are prone to stuttering when replicating, which may impact other polymerase-associated events. low-fidelity H273R PV was examined using this technique. it was found to cause a reduced number of infections compared to wt virus. but H273R was able to replicate quickly enough to reach peak titer at the same time at wt PV. G64R, G64T, and S264L RdRp mutations were all able to increase HEV71 fidelity in vitro [38], but only S264L caused attenuation in vivo when using 5-day-old BALB/c mice. however, when these mutants were later examined in a slightly different virus backbone that was not murine-adapted, G64R was approximately 3-fold less virulent than S264L when using 10-day-old AG129 mice. a repeat of this experiment with two other independently-derived virus stocks failed to replicate this attenuation. the most famous and highly studied fidelity mutant, PV G64S, is also not immune to incongruent results. experiment to calculate LD50 values was 1.2 106 PFU for wt PV and 3.9 108 PFU for G64S, a 325-fold difference. this was the same LD50 values published in a later paper also by the Vignuzzi lab. this alone would not be too concerning as all of the above papers demonstrated that G64S PV was more attenuated in vivo than wt PV. a high-fidelity PV study by Vignuzzi et al. showed that it was the overall diversity of the quasispecies that caused virulence, not any one mutation. this is supported by recent studies that have correlated specific minority variant mutations to increases in virus fitness. this is supported by recent studies that have correlated specific minority variant mutations to increases in virus fitness. mutation frequency of high-fidelity CHIKV C483Y was initially determined to be approximately 1.4-fold higher than wt virus [44]. mutation frequency per 104 bases was slightly higher for wt CHIKV in the initial study compared to more recent papers (5.1 versus 4.4 and 4.4) dashed lines indicate equal levels of mutation frequency for control and fidelity mutant viruses. this is problematic, as outcomes from experiments using fidelity mutants are being used to draw significant conclusions regarding RNA virus evolution [23,80]. fidelity mutants containing putative fidelity mutants are generated from infectious clones. this creates a significant barrier for developing either a controlled experiment, or, in the case of vaccines, a controlled manufacturing process. the vaccine for yellow fever, 17D, is believed to be a safe and effective vaccine based upon multiple attenuating mutations. science, at least when all the above caveats regarding their use are considered."}
