{"summary": "multiplex molecular diagnostic techniques have been widely adopted to detect respiratory viruses. we compared the results of a newly upgraded, multiplex, molecular bead-based respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay with the results of Anyplex II RV16 detection kit and AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay. results Of the 254 respiratory specimens, there was total agreement in the results between the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay and the other real-time Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) and RVP FAST v1 assays proved clinically useful in previous studies [12,13,14,15], and a revised version (xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics) issued a revised version. Luminex xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assays were performed on the collected specimens or stored nucleic acids. the specimens were collected in Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Korea in April 2014, and from December 2014 to April 2015. anyplex II RV16 and AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assays were performed by using the CFX96 real-time PCR system and SLAN-96 real-time PCR detection system. the characteristics and detectable viruses of each kit are summarized in Table 1. adenovirus types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 18, 23, 31, 35, 40, and 41 were obtained from the Korea Bank for Pathologic Viruses. adenovirus types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 18, 23, 31, 35, 40, and 41 were obtained from the enterovirus strain (Coxsackie B5) values were interpreted as follows: values 0.20, 0.21\u20130.39, 0.40\u20130.59, 0.60\u20130.79, 0.80\u20130.90, and >0.90 indicated no, minimal, weak, moderate, strong, and almost perfect agreement, respectively [16]. Statistical analyses were performed by using stored specimens. anyplex II RV16 and AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assays were performed by using the CFX96 real-time PCR system and SLAN-96 real-time PCR detection system. the characteristics and detectable viruses of each kit are summarized in Table 1. one run 45 94 16 Number of detectable viruses 16 19 14 Adenovirus O O Bocavirus 1/2/3/4 O O Coronavirus NL63 O O Coronavirus OC43 O O Coronavirus HKU1 X O X Enterovirus/Rhinovirus O Enterovirus O X Rhinovirus A/B/C O Influenza A O O O Influenza A H1 O Influenza A 2009 H1N1 O Influenza B O O Metapneumovirus O O Parain values were interpreted as follows: values 0.20, 0.21\u20130.39, 0.40\u20130.59, 0.60\u20130.79, 0.60\u20130.79, 0.80\u20130.90, and >0.90 indicated no, minimal, weak, moderate, strong, and almost perfect agreement. 79 specimens showed discrepancies between the two assays. anyplex II RV16 assay was unable to detect three enterovirus/rhinovirus, one influenza type B, and six parainfluenza type 3 specimens. by contrast, the Anyplex II RV16 assay was unable to detect three enterovirus/rhinovirus, one influenza type B, and six RSV type A specimens. all seven specimens showing positive results for coronavirus with the AdvanSure RV assay were also positive with Anyplex II RV16 but were negative with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2. each specimen showed positive results for metapneumovirus (N=8) or parainfluenza type 3 (N=4) with the AdvanSure RV assay. anyplex/xTAG/AdvanSure +//+ +// /+/+////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay missed detecting three types of adenoviruses (31, 40, and 41) and erroneously typed the enterovirus as a rhinovirus. adenovirus type 18 was not detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay. 79 specimens showed discrepancies between the two assays. the total agreement between the xTAG RVP Fast v2 and Anyplex II RV16 assays ranged from 94.1% to 100%. the kappa value ranged from 0.66 to 1.00. anyplex/xTAG +/+ +/ /+ / Total agreement (%) Kappa (95% CI) Adenovirus 17 15 0 222 94.1 0.66 (0.50\u20130.83) Bocavirus 1/2/3/4 25 4 0 225 98.4 0.92 (0.84\u20131.00) Coronavirus 229E 6 1 0 247 99.6 0.92 (0.77\u20131.00) Coronavirus NL63 8 6 0 240 97.6 0.72 in 15 of the specimens with the influenza A virus, the Anyplex II RV16 assay could not differentiate between the H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1 strains of the viruses. one specimen showed positive results for the influenza A virus but was negative for H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1 (Table 2). 0 0 0 Coronavirus NL63 6 0 0 0 Coronavirus OC43/HKU1 0 0 0 Enterovirus/Rhinovirus 0 3 1 4 Influenza A 0 0 0 0 Influenza B 0 0 0 Metapneumovirus 0 0 8 1 Parainfluenza 1 0 0 0 0 Parainfluenza 2 0 0 0 0 Respiratory syncy adenovirus type 1 KBPV-VR-1 detected Detected Adenovirus type 2 KBPV-VR-58 detected Detected Adenovirus type 3 KBPV-VR-2 detected Detected Adenovirus type 4 KBPV-VR-60 detected Adenovirus type 5 KBPV-VR-61 detected Detected Adenovirus type 8 KBPV-VR-3 detected Not detected Adenovirus type 11 any discrepancies in the results were confirmed by using a third multiplex PCR assay, AdvanSure RV. the xTAG RVP v2 assay detected more pathogens than did the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay. however, the xTAG RVP v2 assay detected more metapneumovirus and parainfluenza type 3 specimens. discrepancies between the two assays were revealed in 40 cases (43.5%). the discrepancy mainly resulted from the inability to detect accompanying viruses, mostly adenovirus (13 cases), metapneumovirus (7 cases), and coronavirus NL 63 (6 cases). the Luminex xTAG RVP RVP assay showed higher sensitivities than traditional assays. it could detect more influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus cases, while detect less adenovirus and coronavirus cases. the Luminex xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assay could detect various respiratory pathogens simultaneously. the performance was comparable to that of existing methods in terms of agreement."}
