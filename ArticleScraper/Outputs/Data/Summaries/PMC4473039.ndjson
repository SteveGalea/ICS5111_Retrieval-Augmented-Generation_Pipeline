{"summary": "MPXV is an orthopoxvirus with a broad-host range capable of infecting many animal species. in humans, MPXV causes a disease very similar to the closely related variola virus. a rash is preceded by a 10\u201314 day incubation followed by a 1\u20133 day interval characterized by a prodromal fever, malaise and severe lymphadenopathy of the neck, inguinal and axillary regions. the high mortality rate and morbidity rate of MPXV in humans makes it an important emerging disease for study. no antiviral has been FDA-approved for the treatment of human MPX. a large proportion of the population are contraindicated to vaccination. boHV-4 have been isolated from other ruminant species such as zebu (Bos indicus), American bison (Bison bison), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and sheep. in vitro, BoHV-4 is able to replicate in primary cell cultures or cell lines from various animal species such as cattle, sheep, goats, swine, cats, dogs, rabbits, minks, horses, turkeys, ferrets, chickens, the boHV-4-based vectors to elicit a protective immune response were compared to a smallpox vaccine (MVA) known to induce little to no morbidity [36] we have established a starting point for BoHV-4-based vector applications toward MPX and other important human diseases. the sense primer contains at its 5\u2032-end the NheI restriction site along with the Kozak\u2019s sequence preceding the ATG. the antisense primer contains at its 5\u2032-end a SalI restriction site for the in-frame cloning of the ORF with a gD106 tag peptide present in pCMV-IgK-VP2-gD106 plasmid vector. pCMV-IgK-VP2-gD106 has the pCMV-A29LgD106 was cut with BamHI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase for blunt ending and cut with NheI. pINT2EGFP contains two BoHV-4 Thymidine kinase gene homology regions flanking the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression cassette driven by the promoter. pWPI was first linearized with PmeI, then the PCR reaction was carried out with 0.25 M of a couple of primers. each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, primer annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min and elongation for 90 sec with 1U of Pfu DNA polymerase. the cells were seeded into 6 well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. when the cells were sub-confluent the culture medium was removed. the cells were transfected with pTK-CMV-A29LgD106-TK, pTK-EF1-M1RgD106-TK or pTK-EF1-B6RgD106-TK. cytopathic effect (CPE) occurred in the majority of the cell monolayer. the virus was prepared by freezing and thawing cells three times. pellets were then resuspended in cold EMEM without FBS. a 10% SDS\u2014PAGE gel electrophoresis was used to analyze cell extracts containing 50 g of total protein. the membranes were incubated with bovine anti gD106 monoclonal antibody (clone 1B8-F11; VRMD, Inc., Pullman, WA) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. BAC recombineering was performed as previously described. the supernatant was poured off and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL ice-cold ddH2O by gently swirling the tubes in ice/water bath slurry. the pellet (50 L each) was kept on ice until electroporated with gel-purified fragments. white colonies were grown in duplicate for 5\u20138h in 1mL of LB containing 50 mg/mL of kanamycin or LB containing 12.5 mg/mL of chloramphenicol. only those colonies that were kanamycin negative and chloramphenicol positive were kept and grown overnight in 5mL of LB containing 12.5 mg/mL of chloramphenicol. cell culture electroporation and recombinant virus reconstitution BEK or BEKcre cells were maintained as a monolayer with complete DMEM growth medium with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin. when cells were sub-confluent they were split to a fresh culture vessel (i.e., every 3\u20135 days) and were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humid serum-free EMEM and then overlaid with EMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM Lglutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 2.5-mg/mL Amphotericin B. animals eight-week old female 129 stat1 -/- mice were bred in-house and housed in filter-top microisolator cages. injections were comprised of 100 #x03BC;l of vector + 200 l of vehicle. each vector was injected at a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) each vector was injected at a dose of 2x108 plaques forming units (PFU)/ml. bBooster vaccinations were administered as for a. cMice were challenged via the IN route with 2x105 PFU of MPXV. dRTC, relative to challenge; MTD, mean time to death; SEM, standard error of the mean. cell lines were grown in DMEM (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM of l-glutamine (SIGMA), 100 IU/mL of penicillin (SIGMA), 100 g/mL of streptomycin (SIGMA) and 2.5 g/mL of Amphotericin B (SIGMA) pCMV-IgK-VP2-gD106 has the human cytomegalovirus Immediate Early gene (CMV) promoter. the gD106 epitope of bovine herpesvirus 1 glycoprotein D successfully used as a tag during the cloning. the antisense primer contains at its 5\u2032-end a SalI restriction site for the in-frame cloning of the ORF. 3 ORFs were cut with NheI/SalI and cloned into pCMV-IgK-VP2-gD106. pCMV-A29LgD106, pCMV-M1RgD106 and pCMV-B6RgD106 were cut with the same enzymes. pTK-EF1-M1RgD106-TK and pTK-EF1-B6RgD106-TK constructs were obtained by sub-cloning expression cassettes from pEF1/M1RgD106 and EF1/B6RgD106 respectively in SmaI cut pINT2 [38] all enzymes were purchased from Thermo Scientific. pTK-CMV-A29LgD106-TK, pTK-EF1-M1RgD106-TK or pTK-EF1-B6RgD106-TK using polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent (Polysciences, Inc.) 3 g of DNA were mixed with 7.5 g PEI (1mg/mL) in 200 L of Dulbecco\u2019s modified essential medium (DMEM) at high the virus was prepared by freezing and thawing cells three times and pelleting the virions through a 30% sucrose cushion, as described previously. a plaque-purified isolate of the MPXV strain ZAI-79 [40] was purified through a sucrose cushion [41] and propagated in BS-C-1 cells. electrophoresis was used to analyze cell extracts containing 50 g of total protein. the membranes were incubated with bovine anti gD106 monoclonal antibody (clone 1B8-F11; VRMD, Inc., Pullman, WA) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. aliquot of 25 l (200 ng) was used for each electroporation in a 0.1 cm cuvette. bacteria were recovered in 10 mL LB in a 50 mL baffled conical flask and incubated for 4.5h in a 32\u00b0C shaking water bath. white colonies were grown in duplicate for 5\u20138h in 1mL of LB containing 50 mg/mL of kanamycin or LB containing 12.5 mg/mL of chloramphenicol. only those colonies that were kanamycin negative and chloramphenicol positive were kept and grown overnight in 5mL of LB containing 12.5 mg/mL of chloramphenicol. BAC DNA (5 g) was electroporated in 600 l DMEM without serum into BEK and BEKcre cells from a confluent 25-cm2 flask. cells were split 1:2 when they reached confluence at 2 days post-electroporation. cells were left to grow until the appearance of CPE. eight-week old female 129 stat1 -/- mice were bred in-house and housed in filter-top microisolator cages. mice were fed commercial mouse chow and water ad libitum. animal husbandry and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. each vector was given as a primary vaccination at T = 0 days. each vector was injected at a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) each vector was injected at a dose of 2x108 plaques forming units (PFU)/ml. cMice were challenged via the IN route with 2x105 PFU of MPXV. dRTC, relative to challenge; MTD, mean time to death; SEM, standard error of the mean. eOne mouse was removed due to mortality during blood collection. A29L, M1R and B6R orthologs were selected as candidate antigens to be delivered by BoHV-4 based-vector. orthologs were amplified by PCR from a Cosmid library and sub-cloned in frame with a tag peptide, gD106 [46]. Western immunoblotting of cells transfected with CMV-A29LgD106 (C), EF1-M1RD106 (G) and EF1-B6RD106 (J) negative control was established with pEGFP-1 transfected cells (Mock) supernatant. CMV-A29LgD106, EF1-M1RgD106 and EF1-B6RgD106 expression cassettes were first sub-cloned into pINT2 to generate pTK-CMV-A29LgD106-TK, pTK-EF1-M1RgD106-TK and pTK-EF1-B6RgD106-TK targeting vectors. pBAC-BoHV-4-A-TK-KanaGalK-TK was replaced with the pINT2 shuttle plasmid vector. the 2,650 bp band (yellow circle) has been replaced by a 1,661 bpband (red circle) in pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK. pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK and pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-B6RgD106TK were reconstituted from electroporated BEKcre cells. the only difference was that the a 2 log reduction of the viral titer end-point (104) respect to BoHV-4-A was observed. however, transgene expression was well detected in whole cell extract of BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1-B6RgD106TK. Western immunoblotting of cells, infected with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK (C), BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK (G) and BoHV-4-A-EF1-B6RgD106TK (J) the lanes were loaded with different amounts (5, 10 and 20 l) of serum free cells supernatant. Cages 4 and 5 were vaccinated with vehicle (DMEM without FBS) similar vaccination regimens were performed on cages 6 and 7 (vaccinated with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK), cages 8 and 9 (vaccinated with BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK) mice in cages 10 (B6R/Veh), 11 (B6R/B6R), 12 (Combo/Veh) and 13 (Combo/Combo) only lost weight (5%) on days 6, 7 and 8 post challenge. some protection from weight-loss was also afforded to mice in cages 8 (M1R/veh) and 9 (M1R/M1R) on days 13, 14 and 15 post challenge (15%) a29L, M1R and B6R orthologs were selected as candidate antigens to be delivered by boHV-4 based-vector. only few genes encoding antigenic proteins are able to elicit a neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated animals. A29L (A), M1R (E) and B6R (H) gD106 peptide tagged ORFs full length sequence with the deduced amino acid composition. the diagram (not on scale) of their expression cassette (B, F and I) driven by EF1 (blue) promoter. 1RgD106 and EF1-B6RgD106 expression cassettes were sub-cloned into pINT2. pTK-CMV-A29LgD106-TK, pTK-EF1-M1RgD106-TK and pTK-EF1-B6RgD106-TK targeting vectors were first sub-cloned into pINT2. pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK and pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-B6RgD106TK were serially cultured over for 20 passages and checked by HindIII restriction enzyme digestion. no pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK and pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK were obtained by electroporating pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-EF1- boHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK showed a slower replication kinetics respect to BoHV-4-A. but they reached the same viral titer at the end-point (106). transgene expression was well detected in whole cell extract of boHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK. kinetics of boHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK (B), boHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK (F) and boHV-4-A-EF1-B6RgD106TK (I) growth on BEK cells compared with those of the parental BoHV-4-A isolate. mice in cages 2\u201313 were challenged with 2x105 PFU/mouse of MPXV. mice in cages 2\u201313 were challenged with 2x105 PFU/mouse of MPXV. mice in cage 9 (M1R/M1R) were 100% protected against challenge. mice in cage 13 (Combo/Combo) experienced 1 death. mice in cage 4 (MVA/Veh) only lost weight (5%) on days 6, 7 and 8 post challenge. mice were monitored for weight-change. Error bars indicate SEM. N = 5 mice per group. the presence of M1R is required to protect the mice against challenge. STAT1(-/-) mice are highly sensitive to MPXV and the disease course in MPXV infected STAT1(-/-) mice. it is similar to that observed in wild-type mice infected with mousepox/ectromelia virus (ECTV) A27L, L1R and B5R Vaccinia Virus (VV) antigens are a 14 kDa protein thought to be involved in post viral attachment and pre-fusion events. they were shown to be able to elicit a protective immune response in mice and non-human primates when formulated in combination as a subunit vaccine. the EF1 promoter did not work with the ORFs of M1R and B6R. the presence of A29L protein into the supernatant of the transfected cells has not been determined. a sequence based method for the prediction of mammalian secretory proteins targeted to the non-classical secretory pathway. a putative non-pathogenic strain of BoHV-4 (BoHV-4-A) isolated from a healthy cow whose genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (pBAC-BoHV-4-A) [28] was used. recombinant viable BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1-M1RgD106TK and BoHV-4 in vivo protection studies determined that M1R protected against a lethal MPXV challenge. one hundred % protection was achieved when the vectors were administered twice (prime followed by booster), although the M1R expression vector was not superior to vaccination with MVA as measured by weight-loss. our studies used STAT1(-/-) mice; however, other strains have demonstrated sensitivity to MPXV. future studies should consider evaluating the protection of these vectors. edward et al."}
