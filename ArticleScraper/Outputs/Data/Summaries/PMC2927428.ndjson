{"summary": "the fruit bat species Rousettus aegyptiacus was identified as a potential reservoir for the highly pathogenic filovirus Marburg virus. a molecular understanding of the biology of filoviruses in a recently developed cell line, R06E, derived from the species. filoviruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates of up to 90%. filoviruses are classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) agents. the outbreaks in central africa occur sporadically and unpredictably, the latter contributes considerably to the public awareness of filovirus outbreaks. oviral genomic RNA and antibodies could be detected in bats of different species from the region where outbreaks took place. MARV was isolated from samples of the Megachiropteran Rousettus aegyptiacus that were trapped in regions where outbreaks took place. the assumption that this fruit bat species can also serve as a reservoir for EBOV is based on serologic data. tailed bat cell line Tb1.Lu with EBOV was low but could be stimulated by inducing the Ras/MAPK pathway [24] the unavailability of a cell line from a bat species that is relevant for filovirus transmission to humans constrains research of filovirus biology. titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays. cells were infected with MARV or ZEBOV with 0.1, 0.5 or 5 TCID50/ml per cell. cells were infected with 10-fold serial dilution of supernatants from infected cells. minigenome and iVLP assay Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a MARV minigenome. a plasmid coding for the T7 polymerase (0.5 g) and a construct constitutively expressing a firefly luciferase reporter were co-transfected. Western blot analysis Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. proteins were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. gels were quantified by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System Application Software (Version 2.1.12) RNA was verified by sequencing of the complete genome. cell culture and virus infection VeroE6 (African green monkey kidney cells), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells), HUH7 (human hepatoma cells) and R06E cells were cultured in DMEM. cells were fixed 2 or 3 days p.i. in paraformaldehyde (PFA), glutaraldehyde (4% PFA), 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 60 mM Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.0) the fixative solution was replaced with 4% PFA in DMEM to completely inactivate the sample overnight. the minigenome contained a renilla luciferase reporter gene instead of the CAT gene. a plasmid coding for the T7 polymerase (0.5 g) and a construct constitutively expressing a firefly luciferase reporter (pGL4, Promega, 0.1 g) were co-transfected. at 48 h post transfection, cells and supernatants were harvested. proteins were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. immunoostaining was performed with dilutions of primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween-20. mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect -tubulin. cells and supernatants were harvested between day 6 and 12 after CPE formation. supernatant was used to infect fresh R06E cells (passage 1). supernatants of infected cells collected at day 1, 2, 3 and 7 p.i. were subjected to TCID50 analysis. MARV showed similar growth kinetics and end titers in R06E cells and VeroE6 cells. veroE6 and R06E cells were infected with MARV and ZEBOV at a high MOI, harvested at 48 h p.i. and treated as described under B. analysis by transmission electron microscopy showed viral inclusions (broken lines) in the perinuclear region of VeroE6 (1, 2) and R06E (3, 4) cells at low magnification. we were interested to further investigate whether the amount of intracellular viral proteins was different in veroE6, HUH7 and R06E cells. the three cell lines were infected with 0.1 TCID50 per cell and Western blot analysis was performed with lysed cells at 48 and 72 h p.i. using monoclonal antibodies specific for MARV or ZEBOV VP40. interaction of MARV VP40 with TSG101 or interaction of ZEBOV VP40 with TSG101 and Nedd4 plays an important role during the budding process [37]\u2013[39]. cell lysates were prepared at 48 and 72 h p.i. to detect cellular tubulin and VP40 of MARV and ZEBOV using mouse monoclonal antibodies. transfection of cells we found that the transfection efficiency was 15% for R06E cells, 50% for HEK293, 38% for HUH7 and 27% for VeroE6 cells. reporter signal in all tested cell lines showed no significant differences. also we have tested the Ebola virus minigenome system with R06E, HUH7, VeroE6 and 293 cells. supernatant was collected 72 h p.t. and used to infect R06E cells. supernatant was collected 72 h p.i. and used to infect R06E cells. it was then investigated whether it was possible to produce iVLPs. 293 cells to produce the iVLPs (pc) and R06E cells as ic produced the highest reporter gene signals in the indicator cells. this combination took advantage of the very high transfection efficiency of HEK293 cells for iVLP production and the high capacity for efficient production of viral proteins in R06E cells. it was then investigated whether recombinant MARV could be rescued from R06E cells. recombinant virus was found in the fruit bat-derived cell line. Western blot analyses with VP40- and NP-specific monoclonal antibodies were performed to confirm the presence of recombinant virus in the supernatant. tus aegyptiacus is a reservoir for filoviruses. experimental infection of fruit bats with ZEBOV has been shown to result in productive infection and high titers of virus without clear signs of illness in the infected animals. studies are underway to explore whether hidden repositories of virus are present within infected Rousettus aegyptiacus. R06E cells seem to be more effective in producing recombinant MARV than other cell lines tested. these results emphasize the suitability of the newly established bat cell line for further research in numerous areas of filovirus biology."}
