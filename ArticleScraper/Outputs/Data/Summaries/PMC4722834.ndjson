{"summary": "two studies have suggested a positive association between HCV and IPF. one study found no association between HCV and IPF. adenovirus Given that adenovirus is a persistent virus. IPF who were positive for TTV died within 4 years (6/12 patients; 50%) compared with patients with IPF who were negative (6/21; 28.6%) (25) this virus has also been seen in patients with lung cancer and acute lung injury. the specificity of TTV in driving IPF pathogenesis is still unclear. Vegnon and colleagues found anti-EBV IgG in 5 of 13 patients with IPF (30), Yonemaru and colleagues found evidence of anti-EBV, anti\u2013herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and anti-cytomegalovirus antibodies in patients with IPF. 80% of patients with IPF versus 30% of control subjects (24) 96% of IPF lungs were positive for EBV DNA versus 71% of controls. four of the nine patients with IPF died rapidly, compared with only one rapid death in the 20 LMP-negative patients. one of the most intriguing studies to date comes from Folcik and colleagues. patients with sporadic and familial forms of IPF often had evidence of two or more herpesviruses in the lung. patients with familial IPF often had only one herpesvirus present. in patients with familial IPF, this was most often CMV and rarely was KSHV (10) patients at risk for IPF may experience herpesviral infections of lung epithelium even before disease symptoms are evident. study found infection in 19 of 43 cases of acute IPF exacerbation. this included 12 cases of TTV, one case of parainfluenza, two cases of rhinovirus, one case of coronavirus, one case of HSV-1, and two cases of EBV. two studies have suggested a positive association between HCV and IPF. hepatitis C virus (HCV) has received attention in studies of lung fibrosis. the same study also noted that patients with IPF who develop lung cancer had higher TTV titers than did not develop cancer (25). this virus has also been seen in patients with lung cancer and acute lung injury; thus, the specificity of TTV in driving IPF pathogenesis is still unclear. anti-EBV IgG found in 5 of 13 patients with IPF (30), Yonemaru and colleagues found anti-EBV, anti\u2013herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and anti-cytomegalovirus antibodies in patients with IPF. 96% of IPF lungs were positive for EBV DNA versus 71% of controls. four of the nine patients with IPF died rapidly, compared with only one rapid death in the 20 LMP-negative patients. patients with sporadic and familial forms of IPF often had evidence of two or more herpesviruses in the lung. patients with familial IPF often had only one herpesvirus present. in patients with familial IPF, this was most often CMV and rarely was KSHV (10) patients at risk for IPF may experience herpesviral infections of lung epithelium even before disease symptoms are evident. acute exacerbations of IPF are defined clinically as noninfectious, yet several studies have suggested that occult infections may play some role. acute exacerbations of IPF are defined clinically as noninfectious. equine gamma herpesvirus can cause fibrosis in a natural host. an infection with HV-68 given 14 to 70 days before a fibrotic insult can augment the subsequent development of lung fibrosis. a previous study found that latent viral infection in the lung was associated with increased production of chemokines. idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, or bronchiolitis obliterans. animal modeling suggests that HV-68 infection may also influence lung fibrosis after stem cell transplant (56). herpesviruses can promote fibrosis is the infection of Th2-biased mice lacking IFN- or the IFN- receptor (60\u201363) the requirement for lytic replication and reactivation is also a feature of fibrosis that develops after infection in these Th2-biased mice (63). latent viral infection in the lung was associated with increased production of chemokines that can recruit fibrocytes and other inflammatory cells. we also noted enhanced release of cysteinyl leukotrienes, tumor necrosis factor, and TGF- in latently infected lungs or lung cells (50, 52). studies that look at the impact of viral infection on established fibrosis uncover differences in pathogenic mechanisms. giving the virus after challenge with fluorescein isothiocyanate (58) or bleomycin (59) exacerbates the deposition of collagen in the lung. the ability to exacerbate established fibrosis was dependent on the ability of the virus to undergo lytic replication and reactivation. reactivation of viral infection in older individuals may predispose to fibrotic progression. reprogramming of lung epithelial or mesenchymal cells by latent infection may drive fibrotic processes over time. in animal models, exacerbation requires lytic replication. potential mechanisms for viral influence on the etiology or exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) based on pathogenic mechanisms uncovered in animal models. exacerbation of existing fibrosis likely involves lytic replication. a concerted effort should be made to understand what happens to patients with IPF who do develop bacterial or viral pneumonias. we believe that a concerted effort should be made to understand what happens to patients with IPF who do develop bacterial or viral pneumonias. but how the infection affects their disease process is unknown. the mortality of certain infections is likely different between these patient populations. this review has focused on viral infections in the exacerbation and etiology of IPF. bacterial infections may play a role in disease progression in some patients. studies show benefit for antiviral treatment in some patients with IPF (10, 11) this suggests there may be value in a larger study to evaluate antiviral therapy. one would predict that the benefit would be highest in patients with documented evidence of recent viral infection or reactivation. we do not know whether patients with IPF who develop pneumonia do so due to enhanced extracellular matrix deposition or simply due to fluid accumulation. we suggest that researchers should make it a priority to collect biological specimens and clinical data in this patient population. study identified haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella species to be more abundant in patients with IPF than in control subjects. infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not exacerbate bleomycin-induced fibrosis (59)"}
