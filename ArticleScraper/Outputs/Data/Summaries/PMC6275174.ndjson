{"summary": "the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major intracellular protein degradation pathway. it plays crucial roles in a variety of fundamental cellular processes. the UPS is required for viral infection by affecting viral entry, gene transcription, assembly, release and immune evasion. the molecular mechanism by which the UPS regulates viral replication will provide an alternative potential target for antiviral therapy. SGIV infection causes >90% mortality in groupers and sea bass. MG132 (carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal) and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma. these inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and their cytotoxicity on grouper spleen cells was determined using trypan blue exclusion dye staining. MG132 or DMSO was present in the medium only for 0\u20136 h, 6\u201312 h, 12\u201318 h, and 18\u201324 h in \u201c0\u20136 h,\u201d \u201c6\u201312 h,\u201d and \u201c18\u201324 h\u201d groups. the whole cell lysate at indicated time points were collected and determined for virus titration as described below. the libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) and then sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500) the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to UPS were analyzed as described previously (Gao and Chen, 2018). nuclei were stained with 1 g/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. samples were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the relative RNA expression of several genes. the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the HRP-Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1:1000), anti-VP136 (1:1000), anti-VP72 (1:1500), and anti-VP19 serum (1:1500). spectra were calibrated using trypsin autolysis peptide signals. protein identification with a score >85 was regarded as positive identification. materials Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma. MG132 or DMSO was present in the medium only for 0\u20136 h, 6\u201312 h, 12\u201318 h, and 18\u201324 h in \u201c0\u20136 h,\u201d \u201c6\u201312 h,\u201d \u201c12\u201318 h\u201d and \u201c18\u201324 h\u201d groups. titers were determined on monolayers of GS cells in 96-well plates. in triplicate flasks were collected and total RNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) the libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) and then sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500) the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to UPS were analyzed as described previously. the coverslips were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody, fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the relative RNA expression of several genes. s were resuspended in 1 lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. differentially expressed protein spots were excised from gels for MS analysis. protein identification using peptide mass fingerprinting was performed using the MASCOT search tool. fected GS cells (12, 24, and 48 h) compared to mock-infected GS cells. three structurally unrelated proteasome inhibitors, MG-132, lactacystin and bortezomib, were used to inhibit proteasome activity during SGIV infection. a delay in the severity of CPE was observed in infected cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. asome inhibitors on SGIV-induced CPE at 24 h p.i. (B), cell death (C), and viral production (D). p 0.05. Proteasome Inhibit. mRNA transcripts of VP86, VP136, VP72, and VP19 were all reduced significantly at different time points in MG132-treated infected cells. the protein products of VP72, VP19, VP136, and VP19 were obviously detected from 6 to 24 hpi during infection in DMSO-treated cells. MG132 treatment significantly reduced viral gene transcription and protein synthesis during SGIV infection. SGIV-infected DMSO- or MG132-treated cells were prepared for electron microscopy. many viral particles were observed in almost all the cells. in MG132-treated cells, only a few viral particles were observed. reversible inhibitor MG132 was added at different times during SGIV infection. treatment with MG132 for 0\u20136 h resulted in significant decrease of virus production. the virus titer of the group treated for 6\u201312 h was 1 log unit lower than that of the control. 62 differentially expressed spots were identified in SGIV-infected cells or MG132-treated SGIV-infected cells. all the identified viral proteins were significantly down-regulated. only VP67 and VP6 were weakly detectable in MG132-treated infected cells. sixty-four grouper genes were different regulated during SGIV infection. the majority of genes were significantly down-regulated during SGIV infection. the majority of genes were significantly down-regulated during SGIV infection. a significant delay in the severity of CPE was observed in infected cells treated with MG132, lactacystin or bortezomib. treatment with proteasome inhibitors significantly decreased SGIV-induced cell death (Figure 2C) qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of ubiquitin increased significantly in recombinant plasmid pHA-EcUb overexpressing cells compared to control vector (pCMV-HA) transfected cells. over-expression of pHA-EcUb partially countered the inhibitory effects of MG132. VP72, VP19, VP136, and VP86 were clearly detected from 6 to 24 hpi during infection in DMSO-treated cells. VP86 and VP136 were even undetectable in MG132-treated cells. MG132 treatment significantly reduced viral gene transcription and protein synthesis. SGIV VP19 proteins were found to be mostly localized in the viral factories in DMSO-treated infected cells at 24 h p.i. a few viral particles and no factories were observed after treatment with MG132. the group treated with MG132 from 12 to 18 h p.i. showed a slight decrease of virus titer. MG132 severely affected the virus replication at an early step during SGIV infection. SGIV infection up-regulated (B) or down-regulated (C) proteins were impaired by MG132 treatment. regulated proteins, PDLIM1, PFN2, CTSB, and DUT were significantly up-regulated during SGIV infection. several genes related to the UPS were differentially regulated during SGIV infection. these genes were involved in different aspects of the UPS, including ubiquitination, deubiquitination and proteasome degradation. the UPS plays crucial roles during different viral infections, but theunderlying mechanisms are different. over-expression of grouper ubiquitin partly reverses the inhibitory effect of MG132 on SGIV replication. ubiquitin plays crucial roles in SGIV replication, like other mammalian viruses. the UPS is required for fish iridovirus infection in vitro. our previous studies also demonstrated that grouper CTSB was involved in SGIV replication and SGIV induced apoptosis (Wei et al., 2014). Whether the action of CTSB on SGIV infection was mediated by UPS still remained uncertain.
