{"summary": "asymptomatic, localized, and idiopathic DAD is a typical pathological finding in cases of acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) however, DAD is caused by various such such as infection, transplantation surgery, medication, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops after radiation treatment, acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (AEIIP), and viral lung infections (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza A)1, Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse, patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in the LUL. no bronchiectasis or honeycombing was observed. video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed owing to increased infiltration observed on the chest radiograph obtained on day 10. a localized and slowly progressing pattern of DAD was observed in the patient. the clinical and radiological findings of this patient were not suggestive of either of the 2 diseases. the most common type of AEIIP is acute exacerbation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AEIPF) the diagnostic criteria include: a previous history or diagnosis of IPF, occurrence and/or aggravation of dyspnea for a 30-day period before AEIPF can be diagnosed. idiopathic DAD cannot be classified as either AEIPF or AEIIP. the patient had no specific previous history and was admitted because of dyspnea 30 days before his admission. the patient died because of respiratory failure."}
