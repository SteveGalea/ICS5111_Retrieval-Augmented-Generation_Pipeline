{"summary": "ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation are reversible processes that regulate key factors. these processes directly influence whether ubiquitin/SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) moieties are conjugated/deconjugated to proteins, and how the ubiquitin/SUMO chains will be assembled. ubiquitin is activated by a factor called E1, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA1, UBA6) in an ATP-dependent manner, when a high-energy thioester bond is formed between the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin and an internal Cys residue of E1. ubiquitin ligase, called E3, catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the target protein and ubiquitin moieties de-ubiquitinylation enzymes (DUBs) or ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) catalyze ubiquitin precursors directly after translation into free ubiquitin molecules. DUBs are involved in various biological processes including immune and inflammatory responses, chromatin remodeling, cellular antiviral signaling. ubiquitin is a conserved, 76-amino-acid protein (8.5 kDa), containing seven lysine residues. ubiquitin is a conserved, 76-amino-acid protein (8.5 kDa), containing seven lysine residues. ubiquitin is a conserved, 76-amino-acid protein (8.5 kDa), containing seven lys ubiquitin is activated by a factor called E1, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA1, UBA6) when a high-energy thioester bond is formed between the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin and an internal Cys residue of E1. the ubiquitin ligase, called E3, catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the target protein and ubiquitin moieties. SUMO is activated by the E1 enzymes SAE1/SAE2 prior to being conjugated to the unique E2 enzyme Ubc9. different classes of a very few known SUMO E3 ligases connect SUMOs to target proteins via an isopeptide bond formed between the C-terminal carboxyl group of SUMO and the amino group of the lysine residue in the substrate. the covalent attachment of SUMO to target proteins mainly depends on the target consensus motif KxE/D. however, some reports describe a large number of proteins that lack this consensus sequence but nevertheless can be SUMOylated [3] there might be crosstalk between SUMOylation and phosphorylation [20]. human papillomaviruses (HPV) E6 E3 ubiquitin ligase efficient viral replication oncogenic potential [105,106,107] human papillomaviruses (HPV) E6 E3 ubiquitin ligase efficient viral replication oncogenic potential [48,49,50,51] human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) ICP0 E3 ubiquitin ligase efficient viral replication [89 pUL36 DUB [114] african swine fever virus (ASFV) S273R SENP efficient viral replication [115] Vaccinia virus (VACV) I7 SENP [103,104] Vaccinia virus (VACV) A49 E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibition NF-B inhibition viral virulence immune evasion [77] Rotavirus (RV) NSP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibition v-ubi belongs to the family of baculoviruses with large, rod-shaped, circular DNA. this virus establishes virions, which contain many nucleocapsids within a single viral envelope. v-ubi is highly expressed during the late phase of viral infection. the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCv1 has UBC activity when expressed in E. coli. it can form multi-ubiquitinylated conjugates of histones, di-ubiquitin, and multi-ubiquitinylated UBC/E2 enzymes. it also transfers ubiquitin to histones in an E3-independent reaction. early factors E1B-55K and E4orf6 assemble into an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex associating with host cell components Rbx1/ROC1/Hrt1, Cullin2/5, and Elongin B and C. this high molecular mass complex sequesters specific cellular substrates, such as p53, Mre11, DNA ligase IV, Integrin alpha 3, Tip60, ATRX, and SPOC1 into the KSHV encodes two membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family E3 ubiquitin ligases, K3 and K5, which direct the ubiquitinylation and subsequent internalization. K3 preferentially induces Lys63 linked poly-ubiquitinylation, which requires the E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5b/c and Ubc13 to initiate mono- and subsequent poly-ubiquitinylation of MHC-1 prior to clath MHV-68 (Murine gammaherpesvirus 68) is closely related to human gammaherpesviruses. it did not completely abolish MHV-68-mediated downregulation of MHC-I levels relative to levels in uninfected cells. this suggests that other immunoevasins may be encoded by MHV-68. HPV16 E7 was shown to highjack already assembled E3 ligase containing Cullin2/Elongin B/C and Rbx1 in the infected cell to degrade Rb via the host proteasomal pathway. at least three (Vif, Vpu, and Nef) subvert cellular ubiquitin ligases to block the action of anti-viral defenses. HIV Vpr is a 14 kDa virion-associated protein that promotes infection of non-dividing cells [66], and triggers G2 cell cycle arrest in dividing cells [67,68]. Vpr must associate with the DCAF1/DDB1/Cullin4 ubiquitin ligase complex for Vpr-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest and DNA-damage response. VACV A49 protein mediates anti-NF-kB activity using molecular mimicry to inhibit -TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase function.

HAdV possesses additional strategies to hijack cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase functions. the findings suggest that different HAdVs exhibit distinct Cullin specificities. a gamma-associated herpesvirus is a gamma-associated herpesvirus. KSHV encodes two membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family E3 ubiquitin ligases, K3 and K5, which direct the ubiquitinylation and subsequent internalization. K3 preferentially induces Lys63 linked poly-ubiquitinylation, which requires the E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5b/c and Ubc13 to initiate mono- and subsequent poly-ubiquitinylation of MHC-1 prior to clath MHV-68 did not abolish MHV-68-mediated downregulation of MHC-I levels. this suggests other immunoevasins may be encoded by MHV-68. this suggests that partial recovery of MHC-I expression is sufficient to affect latency establishment. ligase containing Cullin2/Elongin B/C and Rbx1 in the infected cell to degrade Rb via the host proteasomal pathway. the lentivirus causes AIDS, a well-known progressive failure of the immune system, by infecting CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

PML isoforms II\u2013VI require SUMOylation to be recognized by ICP0. SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/-3 conjugates are seen to accumulate. VZV expresses an ICP0 ortholog called ORF61p, which specifically targets the PML-NB component Sp100. DNA binding inside the virions activates the viral protease Avp to cleave 11 amino acids (pVIc) from the HAdV capsid pVI protein precursor. pVIc represents a cofactor and leads to proteolytic maturation of viral capsid precursor proteins inside the virion. UL36 (VP1/2; ICP1/2) is a cellular substrate for this adenoviral DUB. the reactive sequence shows no similarity to any known DUB protein. the conservation of the Cys and His box motifs is characteristic for Cys protease DUB families. a human gammaherpesvirus is associated with a broad spectrum of malignancies of lymphoid and epithelial cell origin. the viral protein BPLF1, the EBV homologue of HSV1 UL36 and HCMV UL48, was shown to encode viral DUB activity. BPLF1 and BXLF1 were also capable of cleaving ubiquitin. all known herpesviruses encode a large tegument protein containing de-ubiquitinylating activity located within their N-terminal regions. these viral DUBs function as cysteine proteases and have a strictly conserved catalytic triad comprised of Cys, His, and Asp acid residue. it is not completely understood whether de-ubiquitinylation of viral or cellular proteins by the UL36 DUB activity plays a part in a predicted papain-like protease with a cysteine protease signature could be identified in the amino termini of the L protein [116]. the protease family also includes proteins encoded by other segmented negative strand viruses (rice stripe virus) and several positive strand RNA viruses (carlaviruses, foveaviruses) it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV PLpro de-ubiquitinates further substrates other than replicase polyprotein sequences in vivo. it is not yet known whether de-ubiquitinylation by SARS-CoV PLpro protects replicase subunits against proteasomal degradation. it is not yet known whether pVIc represents a cofactor and results in further Avp activation. in vitro assays with recombinant purified Avp, substrate proteins, and chemically synthesized pVIc peptides showed that Avp exhibits DUB activity against Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitin. the presence of DUB activity with specificity for ubiquitin was also confirmed in recombinant UL36 proteins from EBV. MCMV/HCMV (betaherpesviruses) 109,123 and MHV-68 (Murine gammaherpesvirus 68) ORF64 [113].

CCHF (Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) is the tick-borne causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever with outbreaks and high mortality in Asia, Europe, and Africa. coV expresses two large polyproteins, which are cleaved into 16 smaller subunits by two coronaviral proteases. a Ub-like domain was identified at the N-terminus of the PLpro catalytic core domain. studies unraveling the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro established high homology with the host-cell USP family of DUBs. ubiquitin-like domain located upstream of protease domain 119 exhibiting protease, DUB, and de-ISGylating activities. enzymatic cascade involves heterodimeric activating enzyme SAE1/SAE2, the conjugating enzyme UBC9. SUMO-specific proteases are required for maturation of SUMO precursors and to reverse SUMOylation. the adenoviral Avp protease and the Vaccinia virus encoded I7 protease also share functional and structural similarities to the SENP proteins. the I7 gene, encoding a 423-amino-acid polypeptide, is expressed late in infection [141] and harbors a C-terminal region of about 200 amino acids. p53 is one of the most recognized regulators of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. early viral protein E1B-55K was reported to possess E3 SUMO ligase functions that specifically target p53 when both factors are relocalized into PML nuclear bodies. p53 is a key event in the onogenic transformation of primary cells induced by adenoviral oncoproteins. oviral E1B-55K, K-bZIP is a strong transcriptional repressor. it has been proposed that K-bZip functions as a viral SUMO ligase with a preferential selectivity towards SUMO-2/-3 paralogs. it is recruited to p53 target sites, dependent on the viral protein\u2019s SIM. adenoviral Avp protease encodes two polyproteins, pp220 and pp62. the I7 gene is expressed late in infection and harbors a C-terminal region of about 200 amino acids. all the proteolytic cleavages occur after the second Gly of consensus sequence Gly-Xaa.

E1B-55K-induced PTM of p53 with SUMO proteins is known to be involved in several aspects of viral protein function. it has been proposed that K-bZip functions as a viral SUMO ligase with a preferential selectivity towards SUMO-2/-3 paralogs. K-bZip is recruited to p53 target sites, dependent on the viral protein\u2019s SIM, and affects multiple p53 downstream genes in a SUMO-dependent manner [111]. the systematic identification of viral analogs for ubiquitin or SUMO enzymes is a complicated task due to the wide sequence variation of the known candidates. despite the difficulties involved, the systematic identification of viral factors that interfere with the ubiquitin/SUMO machineries will be rewarding."}
