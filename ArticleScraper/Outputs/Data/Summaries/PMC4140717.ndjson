{"summary": "the severity of hemorrhagic shock in the low BP group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and arterial lactate. the gut is considered to be the \u201cmotor\u201d driving MOF [5] because hemorrhagic shock reduces intestinal mucosal blood perfusion that leads to intestinal mucosal barrier damage, intestinal barrier dysfunction, ectopic flora, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation. the timing of resuscitation and severity of hemorrhagic shock are critical factors affecting intestinal damage. a hemorrhagic shock model was constructed with new Zealand rabbits. two different levels of shock blood pressures (BPs) were maintained for 180 minutes. we hypothesized that prolonged hemorrhagic shock would cause obvious intestinal damage. serum DAO can be used as an indicator to reflect the differing severities of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury accompanying the two degrees of prolonged hemorrhagic shock. the animals were allowed to stabilize for 30 min before induction of hemorrhagic shock. the withdrawn blood was collected and heparinized with 10 units/ml heparin. a 6.0 to 7.0-cm segment of intestine was resected 10 cm away from the terminal ileum (ileocecal valve) the embedded segments were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. the severity of injury was evaluated by two independent, blinded pathologists using Chiu\u2019s scoring method. odamine-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG diluted 1200 was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the specimen was sealed and observed using a laser confocal microscope. fluorescence intensity was detected at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm for R-phycoerythrin and 405 nm for Hoechst. an aliquot of standard recombinant human MPO (0\u20130.125 units) or samples homogenate was added to 0.5 mL MPO cocktail (80 mM potassium phosphate buffer; pH, 5.4; 0.5% (w/v) hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide; and 1.6 mM 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) the reaction was started by addition of 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxid in all groups were analyzed for blood lactate concentration using a portable blood gas analyzer (i-STAT; Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) significance was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Turkey\u2019s test for comparison among groups. the animals were allowed to stabilize for 30 min before induction of hemorrhagic shock. withdrawn blood was collected and heparinized with 10 units/ml heparin. a 6.0 to 7.0-cm segment of intestine was resected 10 cm away from the terminal ileum (ileocecal valve) the embedded segments were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. the severity of injury was evaluated by two independent, blinded pathologists using Chiu\u2019s scoring method. rhodamine-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG diluted 1200 was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the specimen was sealed and observed using a laser confocal microscope. fluorescence intensity was detected at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm for R-phycoerythrin and 405 nm for Hoechst. an aliquot of standard recombinant human MPO (0\u20130.125 units) or samples homogenate was added to 0.5 mL MPO cocktail (80 mM potassium phosphate buffer; pH, 5.4; 0.5% (w/v) hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide; and 1.6 mM 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) the reaction was started by addition of 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxid the MAP in the low BP group was significantly lower than the MAP in the medium BP group. the shock maintenance phase was successfully prolonged to 180 min to delay the resuscitation after hemorrhagic shock. a higher Chiu\u2019s score represents more severe intestinal damage. in the control group, the intestines manifested lesions with a Chiu\u2019s score of 2.30.67. in the low BP group, the intestines manifested more severe damage. BP group was significantly lower than that of the medium BP group. animals in the medium BP group or low BP group underwent hemorrhagic shock for 180 min at 41\u201350 mm Hg or 31\u201340 mm Hg, respectively, before fluid resuscitation. intestinal MPO activity is considered an index of polymorph nuclear leukocyte sequestration [34], [35], MPO activity was assessed in our prolonged hemorrhagic shock model. the low BP presented a significantly higher intestinal MPO activity than the medium BP group (P0.01). at T3, serum TNF- levels were significantly different between binary comparisons of the control group, the medium BP group, and the low BP group. these results indicate that a more severe hemorrhagic shock induces higher serum TNF- concentrations in the prolonged hemorrhagic shock model. at T1, no significant differences in serum DAO levels were detected between the control group and either the medium BP or low BP group. serum DAO levels in the medium BP and low BP groups were significantly higher than that in the control group. at T2, the low BP group manifested significantly higher lactate levels compared with the medium BP group (18.971.52 mM vs. 14.250.80 mM, respectively, P0.01) the blood lactate concentration at T3 was lower than that at T2 in the medium BP group (P0.05) animals in the medium BP group or low BP group underwent hemorrhagic shock for 180 min at 41\u201350 mm Hg or 31\u201340 mm Hg, respectively, before fluid resuscitation. the control group was the sham shock group. function, immunohistochemistry was used to detect claudin-1 expression in our prolonged hemorrhagic shock model. claudin-1 expression at T3 in the low and medium BP groups showed significantly decreased fluorescence intensity (P0.05), and the fluorescence intensity in the low BP group was significantly lower than that of the medium BP group (P0.05). BP group or low BP group underwent hemorrhagic shock for 180 min at 41\u201350 mm Hg or 31\u201340 mm Hg, respectively, before fluid resuscitation. control group was the sham shock group. at T1, serum TNF- values were not significantly different between binary comparisons of the control group, the medium BP group, and the low BP group. however, serum TNF- levels were significantly different between binary comparisons of the control group, the medium BP group, and the low BP group. serum DAO levels in the medium BP and low BP groups were significantly higher than that in the control group. at T3, statistical analysis of serum DAO content showed a positive correlation with serum TNF- (R = 0.970, P0.01) and a positive correlation with serum TNF- (R = 0.970, P0.01) arterial lactate was measured in our prolonged hemorrhagic shock model. compared with the control group, anticipated increases in lactate levels occurred in the medium BP and low BP groups at T2. the lower the hemorrhagic shock BP, the more severe the hemorrhagic shock following fluid resuscitation. both shock BP and BP after resuscitation in the low BP group were significantly lower than in the medium BP group. serum levels of TNF- and IL-6 rose more than before fluid resuscitation. the more serious the mucosal barrier damage, the more severe the systemic inflammation. the more serious the mucosal barrier damage, the more severe the systemic inflammation. serum DAO levels increased 3\u20136 fold in the low BP group and 2\u20133 fold in medium BP group. increased blood lactate is an indicator of metabolic acidosis. lactate levels were significantly higher than normal after hemorrhagic shock. changes in lactate levels did not correlate with the organ damage after prolonged hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. however, statistical analysis did indicate the change in serum DAO was correlated with the change in TNF-. serum DAO may be a potential indicator of the severity of prolonged hemorrhagic shock."}
