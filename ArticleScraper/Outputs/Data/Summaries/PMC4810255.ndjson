{"summary": "pathogens of particular public health importance are filoviruses [1,2], coronaviruses [3,4], paramyxoviruses [5,6] and lyssaviruses [7,8] other viruses, without a known human disease link, have also been detected recently [9,10,11]. the species group consists of viruses isolated from flying foxes. several mammalian orthoreoviruses have also been isolated from bats. a reovirus has been isolated from an aborted Stellar sea lion. an orthoreovirus from ectoparasites of the Egyptian fruit bat was isolated. we determined the complete sequences [34] of all ten genome segments. we propose that it be regarded as a new species within the Orthoreovirus genus of the Reoviridae family based on its phylogeny. bat flies from individual bats were pooled into a single tube per bat. pools were homogenized at 30 Hz for eight minutes. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 3 min. supernatant used for subsequent virus isolation and nucleic acid extraction procedures. supernatants were collected from all wells displaying CPE. a 1/10 dilution prepared in EMEM, and 1 mL of this used to inoculate a 75 cm2 tissue culture flask. stock virus titres were determined by standard tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) titrations on 96-well microtitre plates. seventy nm sections were cut on a Leica EM-UC6, double stained with saturated uranyl acetate and lead citrate. imaging was done with an Olympus Quemesa CCD camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to increase sensitivity, rRNA was depleted using the same method as described previously.

RNA was extracted from 140 L of the serial supernatant collections. RT-PCR was developed to detect the RdRp gene of MAHLV. RNA extracted from diluted stock MAHLV was used as a qualitative positive control in each run. 273 bat ectoparasite pools subjected to virus isolation by three blind passages. two yielded an agent that caused obvious cytopathic effects. phylogenetic tree (Maximum Likelihood) based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and alignment to sequences available on Genbank, followed by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4) confirm that the bat flies are closest related to Eucampsipoda africana spp. identified before. arrows indicate some of the characteristic spaces between the finger-like, capsomeric projections surrounding the outer capsid layer. TEM observations therefore suggested that the isolated virus belonged to the Reoviridae, sub-family Spinareovirinae. a maximum likelihood tree was constructed with nucleic acid sequence data for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoding segments of representative viruses from the different genera within Reoviridae. a distinct clade is formed by MAHLV, Bush viper reovirus, Baboon orthoreovirus and Broome virus within the genus. ome virus (LambdaB nucleic acid identity\u201460.7%; RdRp amino acid identity\u201458.0%) homomology of divergent major outer capsid protein of MAHLV to known orthoreoviruses is much lower. the two MAHLV isolates are indicated by red stars and groups with other orthoreoviruses. deduced amino acid sequences are in the bottom left triangle and in bold text. grey shaded areas indicate the identity values of the closest related virus(es to MAHLV. cangyuan orthoreovirus 56.6 56.6 63.8 52.9 53.4 56.8 99.4 53.3 53.5 99.4 95.9 98.8 73.3 72.5 71.3 69.8 71.3 53.4 53.3 53.3 53.3 53.5 53.3 53.3 53.4 8.

The genome segments of MAHLV were named according to the nucleotide length. the total genome size is 23,200 nucleotides and predicted to encode eleven proteins, seven of which are structural. all ten genome segments of MAHLV contain an identical 3' terminal sequence, UCAUC-3', which is conserved between all known species of Orthoreovirus. the nucleotide sequences of the two isolates of MAHLV, 2511 and 06-24, are not identical. da B 1265 142.7 Core protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase M1 2341 5'-GGUCA UCAUC-3' 16 39 - mu A 761 87.2 Core protein, transcription factor; ssRNA and dsRNA binding M2 2145 5'-GGUCA UCAUC-3' 28 86 - mu B 676 73.4 Outer capsid protein, membrane penetration during infection M3 2112 5'-GGUCA UCAUC-3' 34 the second start codon (position 19) does not comply with Kozak\u2019s rule. it initiates a 402 nucleotide open reading frame but the deduced amino acid sequence does not match any viral protein of note on Genbank. the deduced Sigma A protein of MAHLV contains the fusogenic orthoreovirus-wide conserved arginine amino acid at position 273. the inoculum containing 101 TCID50/mL virus did not generate detectable viral RNA until day 7. the virus did not replicate in the insect cells (C6-36) up to day 13. adaptation to these cells through serial passaging was not attempted. the second parasite pool that yielded MAHLV isolate 06-24 was collected from an apparently healthy juvenile male. the supernatant collected on day five from passage five in a 75 cm2 flask containing infected Vero cells yielded 1 106.25 TCID50/mL of the unknown virus. identification as an Orthoreovirus by TEM and SISPA-NGS Initial screening of negatively-stained culture supernatants revealed the presence of rounded icosahedrons lacking envelopes. two-layered capsids with an outer diameter of 70\u201375 nm (n = 30) and an inner core of 42\u201345 nm, possessed clearly defined solvent channels radiating outward through the clustered capsid layer. initial sequencing results of both isolates yielded enough sequence coverage to identify all 10 segments. a polyetheleneglycol precipitated preparation of isolate 06-24 yielded the most viral specific reads and formed 11 contigs aligning to Othoreoviruses using BLASTn and BLASTx. maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using the deduced amino acid sequences from the open reading frames (ORF\u2019s) of all the virus\u2019 segments and those of other viruses in the Orthoreovirus genus. clade is visibly distinct from others composed of bat-associated viruses; the Nelson Bay orthoreovirus and bat-derived mammalian orthoreoviruses. sequences of the ORFs in the three large segments, L1, 3 and 2 coding for proteins Lambda A, B and C.
