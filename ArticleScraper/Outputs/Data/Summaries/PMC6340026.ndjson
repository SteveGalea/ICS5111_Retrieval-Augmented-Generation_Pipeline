{"summary": "CHIKV causes a severely debilitating febrile illness marked by polyarthralgia. approximately 25% of affected individuals remain symptomatic for two or more months (3). genetic diversity of the intrahost viral population has been associated with both disease progression (8\u201311) and tissue tropism (12, 13) fidelity variant viruses allow for manipulation of intrahost diversity. point mutations that arose during in vitro mutagen treatment in 2 viral nonstructural genes, nsP2 and nsP4, were shown to confer mutagen resistance. high-fidelity CHIKV result from substitutions in nsP2 G641D and nsP4 C483Y alone (high fidelity, or HiFi) (20), while low-fidelity phenotype was observed with nsP the stability of the LoFi mutation in neonatal mice was not reported. these three studies provide evidence that intrahost CHIKV diversity can affect viral fitness in mice. however, the role of the genome-wide CHIKV mutant spectrum on infection dynamics and disease severity has yet to be defined. high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants replicate to titers comparable to those of the WT in adult mice. low-fidelity CHIKV exhibits attenuated replication and foot swelling. high-fidelity CHIKV populations are more diverse than WT populations in mice. mutation frequencies of each fidelity-variant virus and WT were quantified by bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing. similar relationships were observed in C6/36 cells except for the DM HiFi mutant. fidelity variants replicate to comparable titers and exhibit altered mutation frequencies by bacterial cloning. edes albopictus mosquito larva cells (C6/36) are represented as genome equivalents (eq) per ml. infectious virus measured by plaque assay is represented in PFU per ml (n = 3 biological replicates per group at each time point) mice infected with either HiFi or DM HiFi showed more severe early footpad swelling than the WT at 3 and 4 days postinfection (dpi) CHIKV HiFi-infected mice also showed greater peak disease severity than those infected with the WT 7 dpi (P = 0.003 by one-way ANOVA) CHIKV cohorts 1 to 3 dpi, n = 32; 4 to 9 dpi, n = 20; 10 to 11 dpi, n = 8. adult mouse viremia titers were determined by qRT-PCR. each symbol represents an individual mouse. low-fidelity mutation reduces CHIKV RNA and infectious virus levels in mice.

CHIKV population diversity was also measured by Shannon entropy (C) or RMSD (D). the group with a letter above it was significantly different from the WT. shared SNPs detected in more than one mouse at >1% frequency were identified to characterize tissue- and variant-specific mutations. the absence of shared SNPs or consensus changes in hiFi- and DM HiFi-infected tissues suggests that the differences observed in clinical disease and population diversity are unlikely to be the result of particular secondary or compensatory mutations. the differences observed in clinical disease and population diversity are unlikely to be the result of particular secondary or compensatory mutations. RMSD is maximized at a variant frequency of 0.5 and less biased by variant frequency. more high-frequency (>5%) SNPs were detected in ankles of HiFi-, DM HiFi- and LoFi-infected mice. relative in vitro diversity calculated from mutation frequencies by bacterial cloning does not parallel relative CHIKV population diversities in adult mice. mutation frequencies detected by these methods change as function of host environment. despite corroborating HiFi and DM HiFi as high fidelity in vitro by bacterial cloning, the unexpectedly expanded diversity of CHIKV populations in vivo warranted further investigation. pCHIK-PCR is CHIKV cDNA with PCR at library preparation (control for PCR error), pCHIK is CHIKV cDNA without PCR as a control for sequencing error. over serial passages, the viral titers did not vary significantly between passages or virus variants. the elevation in RMSD and accumulation of high-frequency SNPs in both high-fidelity variants relative to WT CHIKV indicate that HiFi and DM HiFi do not always produce less genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV. however, there were no specific nucleotide substitutions in which HiFi and DM HiFi populations had significantly lower frequencies than the WT after p1 or p5. a mutated site was defined as any nucleotide position with evidence of a substitution regardless of frequency. by mutated site frequency, the observed GC>AU trend is no longer evident. the GC>AU ratios of p5 populations are similar between HiFi, DM HiFi, and the WT. d or variant CHIKV amplicon enrichment Overlap error correction Cell type Passage no.

RMSD for the p0 and p5 PRNT inocula approximated the minimum and maximum RMSD for WT CHIKV isolated from mouse ankles 3 dpi. attenuation of LoFi CHIKV in adult mice agrees with previous report of attenuated replication in neonates (20), suggesting that attenuation of LoFi CHIKV is not host age dependent. surprisingly, when we employed NGS, the mutation frequencies for HiFi, DM HiFi, and WT CHIKV were not statistically different after one cell culture passage. mutant spectra of in vitro and in vivo CHIKV populations exhibit increased frequency of GC>AU substitutions for HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV. to limit systematic errors, we equalized input titers prior to library preparation, prepared libraries in parallel, included CHIKV DNA plasmid libraries as controls for sequencing and reverse transcription-PCR errors. the elevated frequency of G>U transversions may be explained in part by oxidative damage during NGS library preparation (47). we excluded all G>U substitutions, recalculated the metrics, and found the relationships were maintained. from these analyses, we conclude that our observed population diversity measurements are unlikely to have been biased by systematic errors, host deaminases, or differential host adaptation. cell type has been shown to alter mutation frequencies of CHIKV populations. kinetic proofreading model proposes a trade-off between replication speed and accuracy. nsP2 and nsP4 mutations enhance virulence in adult mice. high-fidelity nsP4 mutation exerts phenotypic effects beyond altered replication speed or fidelity. nsP4 mutation exerts phenotypic effects beyond altered replication speed or fidelity. high-fidelity CHIKV variants produce populations with greater diversity. nonsynonymous mutations in E2 and 1 mutation was detected in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) our results parallel tissue-specific evolution of poliovirus (66), indicating that tissue microenvironment as a driver of viral evolution is common across RNA virus families. this observation suggests that serum neutralization of CHIKV is driven more by the depth than the breadth of the antibody response. nsP2 and nsP4 high-fidelity mutations induce more severe arthritic disease in adult mice than WT CHIKV. they produce more diverse virus populations and serum antibodies less able to neutralize low-diversity inocula in vitro. fidelity phenotype of the nsP2 and nsP4 mutations under different cellular contexts. baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21; ATCC CCL-10) and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC CCL-81) were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S; Gibco, Therm a 750-nt region (nt 10019 to 10768) of the E1 envelope gene was amplified by high-fidelity RT-PCR (Agilent Accuscript PfuUltra II RT-PCR kit) at least 80 amplicons, representing >60,000 nt, were sequenced for each virus from both BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. blood was collected on 1, 3, 5, 9, and 30 dpi, with 30-dpi blood processed to harvest serum. mice from each treatment group were euthanized on 3, 9, or 30 dpi. brain, liver, calf muscles, and ankle joints were collected. amplification was achieved for just one mouse in the WT, HiFi, and DM HiFi cohorts. amplification was only achieved with primer set 7, which covered the 26S promoter to the 3\u2032 end of the envelope protein 2 gene (E2) due to poor RT-PCR amplification, NGS was not performed for any LoFi-infected muscle isolates. libraries generated from CHIKV infectious clone DNA with (pCHIK-PCR) or without (pCHIK paired-end reads were quality (>Q35), adapter, and primer trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.36) (71) alignment was performed with the Burrows Wheeler alignment tool (bwa mem, v0.7.5) (73) infectious CHIKV was rescued from cDNA clones as previously described (15) for rescued virus stocks and experiments described below, viral RNA and infectious virions were titrated in triplicate by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) the Aedes albopictus cell line C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) was maintained in Schneider\u2019s insect medium (Caisson Labs) supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% P/S at 28\u00b0C and atmospheric CO2. rescued stocks (p0) of each CHIKV fidelity variant or WT were inoculated. at least 80 amplicons, representing >60,000 nt, were sequenced for each virus from both BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. mutation frequencies were measured by bacterial cloning for one biological replicate per virus in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells, except for WT and DM HiFi in C6/36 cells. Tissues for NGS and qRT-PCR were immersed in RNAlater. RNA was extracted by a MagMax-96 viral isolation kit (AM1836; Thermo Fisher Scientific) plicons were fragmented with double-stranded DNA fragmentase (New England Biolabs), followed by KAPA pure bead (Kapa Biosystems) size selection targeting a mean length of 150 bp. libraries generated from CHIKV infectious clone DNA with (pCHIK-PCR) or without (pCHIK) PCR amplification prior to library preparation were incorporated as controls for PCR and sequencing errors. paired-end reads were quality (>Q35), adapter, and primer trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.36) (71). paired-end reads were merged, and mismatched base calls were resolved by highest quality score with FLASH (v1.2.11)"}
