{"summary": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) is the most economically significant infectious disease currently affecting swine worldwide. Typical clinical symptoms of PRRS are mild to severe respiratory disease in infected newborn and growing pigs. infection with PRRSV induces an antibody response (production) by 7\u20139 DPI. the virus also evades host cell-mediated immunity most likely by the promotion of immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF- and action of Treg (21\u201323). the use of animals was approved by the Branch Commission for Animal Welfare of the Czech Republic (approval protocol no. MZe-1487) as part of project as a part of project Respig (QJ1210120). Vaccines Four commercial vaccines were used. their characteristics are in Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of vaccines used in the experiment. two groups of piglets (A1 and A2) were immunized. each animal was administered 2 ml of inactivated vaccine by an intramuscular injection. piglets from the other two groups (B3 and B4) were revaccinated with the same dose. al contents, bronchoalveolar lavage, heparin-treated blood samples were taken from the jugular vein. group saline samples were collected using ropes left in the hutch for 3 h. RNA was used for qRT-PCR amplification by EZ-PRRSVTM MPX 4.0 real time RT-PCR kit (Tetracore) swine sera tested were examined by commercially available ELISA test INGEZIM PRRS UNIVERSAL (ingenasa) one hundred microliters of serum samples diluted 1:40 (for detection of IgM antibodies) or 100 L of non-diluted samples of BAL were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. two hundred and fifty microliters of oral fluids diluted 1:2 were incubated 16 h at 4\u00b0C. cytopathic effect (CPE) of PRRSV on MARC-145 was evaluated by optical microscopy. the reciprocal value of the last sera dilution was defined as virus neutralization antibody titer. the number of cells used in the test was 5 105/well. PRRSV was used for stimulation of the antigen-specific response in multiplicity of infection 0.5. the cells were rinsed and then 70 L of anti-CD3 antibody (IgG1, clone PPT3, Southern Biotech, pre-stained with Alexa Fluor 488 dye) was added. 5 L of RPE-conjugated anti-IFN- antibody (clone CC302, AbD Serotec UK) was added. group of five piglets were immunized i.m. with modified live vaccine B3 (Amervac PRRS) or B4 (Porcilis PRRS) at interval D21. all animals were infected with a challenge virus on D42. stock virus was clarified by centrifugation. concentration of stock virus was 5 106 plaque forming units per mL. piglets were assigned to five groups of five animals each according to weight. a TKX mixture containing 12.5 mg/mL tiletamine and 12.5 mg/mL zolazepam (Telazol, Virbac, Carros, France), 12.5 mg/mL ketamine (Vetoquinol, Lure, France), and 12.5 mg/mL xylazine (Bioveta, Ivanovice na Hane, Czech Republic) was administered intramuscularly in a final volume of 0.2 quantitative RT-PCR for Viral Load Detection Total RNA from experimental samples of sera, oral fluids, and BAL (100 L) was extracted using a NucleoSpin\u00ae RNA II kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) the RNA obtained was eluted in 60 L RNase-free water and immediately used for qRT-PCR amplification. the recombinant N protein diluted in 50 mM Bicarbonate-Carbonate Buffer pH 9.6 to a final concentration of 1.5 g/mL was coated on 96-well-microtiter plates overnight at 26\u00b0C. wells were then blocked with 3% skimmed milk in PBS for 90 min at 37\u00b0C and then washed with PBS. positive and negative controls were included in each test plate. samples of sera were diluted 1:4 in DMEM medium (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) supplemented with 3% FBS. heat inactivated sera (56\u00b0C for 60 min) were diluted 2-fold serially in flat-bottom 96-well-microplate (NUNC) then equal volume (50 L) of media containing 50 PRRSV PFU (Lelystad\u2014CAPM V-490) was added to each well. 3H-thymidine was added on the last day of cultivation. the cells were harvested (FilterMate Harvestor, Packard Bioscience Company, USA) the results were expressed in terms of stimulation indexes (SI), which were calculated as the ratio of CPM in stimulated samples vs. CPM in non-stimulated controls. anti-CD8 (IgG2a, clone 76-2-11, WSU, USA) and anti- TCR (IgG1, clone PGBL22A, WSU, USA) and 20 L of heat-inactivated goat serum were added. cells were incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and then rinsed twice with cell washing solution. the percentage of IFN--positive cells was established for each subpopulation. experimental groups were compared using non-parametric man-whitney test. in sera with home-made ELISA (A\u2013IgM) or the commercial ELISA test Ingezim PRRS universal (B\u2013IgG) Levels of virus neutralization antibodies 21 days after vaccination and 21 days after infection (C) cells positive CD4+CD8+cells positive CD4+CD8+cells positive VIRUS LOAD serum saliva feces serum saliva feces serum saliva feces serum saliva feces serum saliva feces serum saliva feces serum saliva feces. group of 5 piglets were immunized i.m with modified live vaccine B3 (Amervac PRRS) or B4 (Porcilis PRRS) at interval D21 a further increase in serum IgG antibodies was observed for the A1 group. this antibody level significantly exceeded the values in the MLV immunized groups (B3 and B4) and the control one (C5). the level of serum IgG antibodies at these intervals was comparable to A1. in the feces, local antibodies (IgA) were detected from 1 week after the second immunization dose in groups A1 and A2. increased levels of antibody were detected in all groups including control after infection with no statistically significant between-group difference. levels of antibodies were measured in oral fluids (A), fluid from bronchoalveolar lavages (B\u2013IgG, C\u2013IgA) and feces (D\u2013IgA) with home-made the results were recalculated to the number of CD3+ lymphocytes. groups immunized with inactivated vaccines A1 and A2 showed a marked non-specific stimulation of cells even without using antigen. cell-mediated immune response after challenge infection was positive in all vaccinated groups and in the control group after 21 days post infection. piglets were immunized i.m with modified live vaccine A1 (Progressis) or A2 (Suivac PRRS-In) at interval D21. piglets were immunized i.m with modified live vaccine B3 (Progressis) or B4 (Porcilis PRRS) at interval D21. levels of antibodies were measured in sera with home-made ELISA (A\u2013IgM) or the commercial ELISA test Ingezim PRRS universal (B\u2013IgG) Levels of virus neutralization antibodies 21 days after vaccination and 21 days after infection (C) group of 5 piglets were immunized i.m with inactivated vaccine A1 (Progressis) or A2 (Suivac PRRS-In) at intervals D0 and D21. all animals were infected with a challenge virus on D42. all levels or activities after vaccination or infection are expressed as \u2013 (negative) or + to + + + as positive at different intensity. a further increase in serum IgG antibodies was observed after 1 week and especially at 14 and 21 days after infection. the level of serum IgG antibodies at these intervals was comparable to A1. local antibodies were detected in the saliva of the A1 group in low concentrations 14 and 21 days after the second vaccination. increased levels of antibody were detected in all groups including control after infection with no statistically significant between-group difference. levels of antibodies were measured in oral fluids (A), fluid from bronchoalveolar lavages (B\u2013IgG, C\u2013IgA) and feces (D\u2013IgA) with home-made ELISA. the number of IFN- producing cells was calculated in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) on D63, i.e. 21 days after the challenge infection. the results were recalculated to the number of CD3+ lymphocytes. the virus was detected in all groups including the control group 3 days after infection. shedding was decreased in immunized groups 14 and 21 days after infection. the level in the A1 and B3 group was significantly lower compared to control group 21 days after infection. antibodies after immunization and infection, and the virus after infection, can be detected in all the monitored compartments (blood, respiratory tract, intestine) by repeated sampling and simultaneous monitoring of the antibody and cell-mediated immunity and virus shedding systematically and locally. a positive cell-mediated response after lymphocyte stimulation with specific antigen in vitro was observed in MLV groups. the strong non-specific stimulation of PBMC without specific antigen was detected in groups A1 and A2 immunized with inactive types of vaccine. this non-specific stimulation of cells in vivo masks the overall picture, and thus specific cell-mediated immunity cannot be demonstrated. high levels of antibodies were produced generally (serum), which were mostly of the IgM, and IgG isotypes, and also locally (saliva, BALF), both IgG and IgA. the antigen specific cell mediated immunity after inactivated vaccine is rarely described. there was an obvious difference in the quality between the inactivated vaccines. the character of the immune response to both MLV vaccines was similar. the strain used in Porcilis had a higher genetic link with the Lelystad strain compared to the strain of Amervac (54, 55), which probably did not significantly affect the above characteristics. VC, JS, and MF designed the study. LL, JS, and KN performed the experiments. LK produced the figures and statistical analysis."}
