{"summary": "recognition of viral double-strand RNA molecules by intracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs) or retinoic acid inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs) is a central event which entails the early steps of the immune response elicited during viral infections. a functional anti-viral role of TLR3 has been demonstrated for several animal and human viruses. +sRNA viruses are able to induce two types of membranous modifications as replicative niches: invaginated vesicles or spherules or a double membrane vesicle type. the virus builds its hideout to shelter from dsRNA receptors. a recent proposed mechanism will be included to clarify this intriguing crossroad. TLR3 recognizes genomic dsRNA or dsRNA replication intermediates present in virus-infected cells independently of the sequence. TLR3 is broadly expressed in immune and non-immune cells and has a high level of conservation among vertebrates. dsRNA-TLR3 high affinity binding is strikingly dependent on the acidic environment since protonation of histidine on the TLR3 surface is required to allow ionic interaction. phosphorylation of the Tyr759 and Tyr858 residues in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 is required for triggering the recruitment of TRIF to the TIR domain of TLR3. the cytoplasmic sentries RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) include the cytosolic retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) both share the same molecular architecture consisting in a conserved \u201chelicase\u201d core connected to two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) at the N-terminus, and an RNA binding domain known as C-terminal an overview of RIG-I interaction with viruses from different genera has been recently reviewed by Kell and Gale (2015). on the other hand, MDA5 binds to long dsRNA (>1000 bp) with no end specificity. both RLRs form large oligomeric structures around dsRNA molecules. to overcome the innate antiviral response, viral particles include ways to circumvent INF-/ production achieved by blocking the RLR pathway in its upstream portion. hiding dsRNA molecules from RLRs in compartmentalized microenvironments inside the cytoplasm comprise a powerful strategy to tackle RLRs-induced antiviral response. CHIK causes painful arthritis with symptoms that can persist for years. SFV and CHIKV are very similar in terms of molecular and cell biology. there are currently no effective vaccines or treatments for human alphavirus infections. these four units form a macromolecular arrangement responsible of viral genome replication. they harbor a conserved catalytic Gly-Asp-Asp triad (Kamer and Argos, 2001). together, they give rise to replication complexes colocalizing to bulb-shaped membrane invaginations designated spherules. the nsPs are synthesized from the viral positive-sense RNA genome as one polyprotein. of the four nsPs, only nsP1 thanks to an amphipathic helix spotted in the central part of the polypeptide is the only non-structural protein that interacts with membranes. the membrane association of nsP1 is mediated through direct interaction of an amphipathic helix with anionic phospholipids. from 2 to 4 h p.i., the RCs components were localized to small intracellular vesicles and then later in the infection, the dsRNA localized to large vacuoles in the perinuclear area, the so called CPV-I. the authors also observed that PM-associated spherules trafficking was strongly dependent upon the activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and a a nice graphic schematizing a model for the alphavirus RCs trafficking and biogenesis of CPV-I has been depicted by Spuul et al. (2010). members of the togaviridae family induce viral replication factories with spherule morphology usurping the endosomal and lysosomal pathway from the cell. the authors employed several EM techniques to obtain the 3-D analysis of the virus-induced membrane rearrangements involved in DENV replication. they showed that they are invaginations of the ER membrane, connected to the cytosol through a pore that may regulate import of factors required for RNA replication and export of newly synthesized genomes to be used for virus assembly. poliovirus particles consist of an icosahedral protein shell surrounding the naked RNA genome of around 7500 nucleotides. the basic building block of the picornavirus capsid is a protomer, which contains one copy each of four structural proteins. the shell is formed by VP1\u2013VP3, and VP4 lies on its inner surface. it is believed that the dsRNA functions as replicative intermediate during the synthesis of viral RNA. newly synthetized membranous structures, but not pre-existing cell membranes, are required for viral replication. formation of the complex replication factories requires coupled viral translation, lipid synthesis, new membranes generation and viral RNA synthesis. poliovirus replication vesicles may be associated or derived from COPII-vesicles. however, more recent studies indicate that classical COPII vesicles do not seem to be the site for RNA replication. poliovirus replication vesicles are involved in specialized membrane vesicles. virions were in between clustered vesicles and within double-membrane vesicles labeled with the autophagic protein LC3 where RNA replication was taking place. the virions were in between clustered vesicles and also within vesicles labeled with the autophagic protein LC3. the Kikergaard's group was the first demonstrating that autophagy benefit poliovirus replication since treatment with autophagy inducers such as rapamycin increased viral particles production. polioviruses hijack autophagic components to allow their assembly, maturation and exit from the host cell, via a process known as AWOL. Nikonov et al. (2013) have proposed a novel mechanism of action for type I interferons induction upon RdPp activity detection inside the cell. they found that active SFV replicase is able of inducing INF- without the replication-competent viral RNA. dsRNA structures generated by SFV replicase associated to endosomes and lysosomes were strongest INF- inducers from those present in the cell. the viral replicase molecules would anchor to endosomes membranes to build up membranous spherules where viral dsRNA or 5-ppp RNA intermediates keep inaccessible to host sensors. cellular mRNA as template originating dsRNA molecules in the cytoplasm, exposed to the Pamp Recognition Receptors (PRRs (MDA-5 and RIG-I) to initiate the innate immune response, which produces the viral restriction (2). despite the few +sRNA viruses for which the induction of the innate immune response has been observed to be thanks to RdRp activity, it seems likely that it may be a universal mechanism employed by the host cell to withstand the con toll-like receptor 3: the intravesicular sensor TLRs are type I transmembrane domain family of proteins with a tripartite structure. they consist of an amino (N)-terminal ectodomain containing leucine rich repeats responsible for ligand recognition, a single transmembrane spanning region and a carboxyl (C)-terminal globular cytoplasmic Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor (IL- dsRNA-sensing TLRs are translocated from the ER to lysosomes. the molecular mechanism of ligand-dependent trafficking of the TLRs is unknown. dsRNA-TLR3 is able to recognize dsRNA longer than 40 bp for robust stimulation. phosphorylation of the Tyr759 and Tyr858 residues in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 is required for triggering the recruitment of TRIF to the TIR domain of TLR3. TRIF recruitment results in stimulation of the transcription factors IRF3 (interferon regulatory transcription factor 3), NF- (nuclear factor-) and AP-1 (activator protein 1) thought two different branches (Alexopoulou et al., 2001; Sato e RNA recognition by RIG-I involves three different domains (HEL1, HEL2i, and the CTD) that together clasp the duplex RNA, enwrapping it within a network of interactions that are dominated by polar contacts. short (300 bp) dsRNA panhandle structures are stimulatory if they contain exposed 5\u2032-triphosphate (5\u2032-ppp) and blunted 5\u2032 end. both RLRs form large oligomeric structures around dsRNA molecules. dsRNA molecules serve as platforms for recruitment and nucleation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) the polymeric form of MAVS is tethered to the mitochondrial membrane. semiliki forest Virus (SFV) belongs to the togaviridae family. it is the sole group of +sRNA viruses that modify endosomal and lysosomal membranes to replicate their genomes. alphaviruses are a genus of viruses generally transmitted by mosquito vectors. CHIKV re-emerged in 2004 to cause outbreaks of millions of cases in countries around the Indian Ocean area, in Asia, and recently the Caribbean. alphaviruses are small-enveloped particles that enter the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. the viral nucleocapsid is disassembled with the aide of ribosomes. the SFV genome, 11.5 kb long with a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 poly (A) sequence, is translated into a replicase polyprotein. the spherules were first described between late 1960s and early 1970s. they were found in the membranes of large cytoplasmic compartments. the spherules contained endosomal and lysosomal markers. the nsPs are synthesized from the viral positive-sense RNA genome. nsP1 has specific affinity for negatively charged phospholipids explaining its predominant localization to plasma membrane (PM) it is increased by post-translational palmitoylation of one to three cysteine residues at positions 418\u2013420. it has been demonstrated that nsP1 can only become palmitoylated after associating with membranes via the amphipathic peptide. spherules associated to PM-derived vesicles morphologically similar to endocytic vesicles at the stage of internalization. the average size of CPV-I reaches 2 m at 12 h p.i. significantly exceeding the sizes of late endosomes and lysosomes in non-infected cells. the first 3-D reconstruction coming from a +sRNA viral replication niche was published by Kopek et al. (2007). the authors employed several EM techniques including electron tomography (ET) to obtain the 3-D analysis of the virus-induced vesicles. er-associated Polioviruses belong to the genus Enterovirus of Picornaviridae family. poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), enterovirus 71, and rhinovirus. the viral ARN encodes a single poliprotein, which is cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases to yield 11\u201315 final polypeptides. the P1 region encodes the viral capsid proteins, whereas the P2 and P3 regions encode proteins involved in protein processing and genome replication. a hallmark of this type of virus is the remarkably rearrangement of cellular membranes into organelle-like replicative factories. several poliovirus and host proteins are involved in the membrane rearrangements that are essential for virus RNA replication. the viral protein 2BC is responsible for the generation of 50\u2013350 nm clusters of empty vesicles limited by a single membrane. it is well known that Arf1 is critical for the proper functioning of the secretor. the release of COPII-coated vesicles that bud from ER exit sites increases in poliovirus-infected cells. however, more recent studies indicate that classical COPII vesicles do not seem to be the site for RNA replication. the virions were in between clustered vesicles and within double-membrane vesicles labeled with the autophagic protein LC3 where RNA replication was taking place. the virions were in between clustered vesicles and also within double-membrane vesicles labeled with the autophagic protein LC3 where RNA replication was taking place. LC3 silencing with a siRNA leads to a decrease of viral cell-to-cell spread. autophagy induction favors this non-lytic release in both cultured cells and mice. the release of viral particles via a non-lytic process was previously suggested by a study in the spinal cords of bonnet monkeys. the authors proposed a novel mechanism of PAMPs generation and INF- induction by the viral. they found that dsRNA structures generated by SFV replicase were the strongest inducers from those present in the cell. the viral replicase molecules would anchor to endosomes membranes to build up membranous spherules where viral dsRNA or 5-ppp RNA intermediates keep inaccessible to host sensors any longer. after viral internalization and uncoating, the genomic RNA serves as mRNA recognized by the host cell machinery to translate the viral replication complex. painter and colleagues observed the presence of endogenous dsRNA molecules in un-infected tissues of RdRp transgenic mice. despite the few +sRNA viruses for which the induction of the innate immune response has been observed to be thanks to RdRp activity, it seems likely that it may be a universal mechanism employed by the host cell to withstand the viral conquest. the exact topology of RNA replication sites for DMV-type replication factories is yet uncharacterized. novel experimental techniques such as metabolic in situ labeling of nascent viral RNA and its visualization by using high resolution and specific microscopy methods will help tackle this important feature of +sRNA viruses replication."}
