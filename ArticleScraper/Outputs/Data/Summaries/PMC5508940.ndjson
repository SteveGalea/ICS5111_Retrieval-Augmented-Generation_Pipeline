{"summary": "Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) is a Gram-negative bacterium. it is one of about 12 pathogens that have been causally associated with the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). there has been controversy about the relative efficacy of these vaccines in stimulating primary protective immune responses and in their comparative utility as 'booster shots' patients were randomized into 2 groups using a computerized random number generator. patients were randomized into 2 groups using a computerized random number generator. patients were questioned about their dogs\u2019 lifestyle as related to potential exposure to other dogs.
