{"summary": "adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus were detected. influenza vaccination rate was 21.7% (430/1,983) during the 2011\u20132012 season. large-scaled study on epidemiology of respiratory viruses is important to understand the situation of individual country. a retrospective analysis of the respiratory viruses was performed in patients with respiratory illnesses in south Korea [4], [6]. a lack of information regarding large-scaled multi-center viral surveillance of adult patients with ILI (influenza-like illness) in emergency department (ED) the study population included adult patients (18 years) who visited an ED with ILI from week 40, starting Sep 25, 2011, through week 22, ending Jun 2, 2012. the study population included adult patients (18 years) who visited an ED with ILI from week 40, starting Sep 25, 2011, through week 22, ending Jun 2, 2012. 4 L 5X RV15 ACE primer mix, 10 L 2X Multiplex master mix, 3 L 8-MOP solution and 3 L of the sample\u2019s cDNA were mixed in a tube. a PCR reaction was performed using 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 90 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 90 seconds, followed by extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. fish\u2019s exact test was used to analyze categorical variables. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Specimen Collection A nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal flocked swab was obtained from each ILI patient. the flocked swab was placed in viral transport medium (BD, USA) immediately and stored at 4\u00b0C. samples were then kept at 70\u00b0C until use. PCR reaction was performed using 45 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 90 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 60 seconds, followed by extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. the median age of patients was 43 years (IQR 31\u201363), and 811 patients were male (40.9%). at least one chronic underlying disease was found in 356 patients (18.0%) diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comorbidity (36.8%, 131/356) in patients with ILI. forty five (12.6%) patients had cardiovascular disease. 3.9) 50\u201364 390 (19.7) 56 (19.3) 11 (14.3) 157 (21.4) 49 (17.4) 7 (15.9) 17 (21.3) 93 (19.5) 65 460 (23.2) 37 (12.8) 13 (16.9) 173 (23.5) 38 (13.5) 15 (34.1) 14 (17.5) 170 (11.3) 472 (99.2) none 942 (47.5) 49 (16.9) 62 (80.5) 533 (72.5) 216 (76.9) 29 (65. 20.0) 6 (23.1) \u2013 Hematologic malignancy 6 (1.7) \u2013 1 (6.7) 3 (1.6) \u2013 1 (3.8) \u2013 \u2013 Organ transplantation 2 (0.6) 1 (2.6) \u2013 \u2013 1 (0.5) \u2013 \u2013 Autoimmune disease 14 (3.9) 3 (7.9) \u2013 9 (4.7) 2 (3.1) \u2013 \u2013 Pregnancy 32 (9.0) 7 (18.4) 1 (6.7) 9 (4.7) 12 (18.5) 1,033 samples (52.1%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. in the 2011\u20132012 season, H3N2 was prominent (606, 55.1%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in two patients. the distribution of influenza viruses appeared to be bimodal. 69 (6.3) 7 (4.0) 2 (4.3) 13 (3.9) 16 (9.1) \u2013 \u2013 31 (10.9) Influenza B 169 (15.4) 39 (22.2) 2 (4.3) 38 (11.3) 42 (23.9) 1 (4.3) 1 (1.7) 46 (16.2) Adenovirus 7 (0.6) 1 (0.6) 2 (4.3) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1 (1.7) 3 (1.1) Rhinovirus 86 (7.8) 12 (6.8) 4 (8.7) 27 za virus 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Enterovirus \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Bocavirus \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 two respiratory viruses were detected concurrently (Table 3). five patients with influenza A also had two other viruses: rhinovirus and RSV, rhinovirus and adenovirus, rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus. single virus (n = 975) Multiple virus (n = 58) P Influenza vaccination 222 (24.5) 11 (22.9) 1.00 Comorbidity 172 (17.6) 8 (13.8) 0.59 DM 67 (25.7) 1 (8.3) 0.31 Cardiovascular disease 24 (9.2) 2 (16.7) 0.34 Cerebrovascular disease 25 (9.6) 2 (16.7) 0.34 Neuromuscular disease 3 (1.1) 0 (0) 1.00 Chronic kidney disease 12 (4.6) 0 (0) 1 at least one chronic underlying disease was found in 356 patients (18.0%) diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comorbidity (36.8%, 131/356) in patients with ILI. forty five (12.6%) patients had cardiovascular disease. 119 (42.3) 13 (29.5) 34 (42.5) 114 (23.9) 50\u201364 390 (19.7) 56 (19.3) 11 (14.3) 157 (21.4) 49 (17.4) 7 (15.9) 17 (21.3) 93 (19.5) 65 460 (23.2) 37 (12.8) 13 (16.9) 173 (23.5) 38 (13.5) 15 (34.1) 14 (17.5) 170 (11.3) 472 (99.2) none 942 (47.5) 49 (16.9) 62 (80.5) 4) 2 (13.3) 25 (13.0) 12 (18.5) 3 (20.0) 6 (23.1) \u2013 Hematologic malignancy 6 (1.7) \u2013 1 (6.7) 3 (1.6) 1 (1.5) \u2013 1 (3.8) \u2013 \u2013 BM transplantation 1 (0.3) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Organ transplantation 2 (0.6) 1 (2.6) \u2013 \u2013 1 (0.5) \u2013 \u2013 Autoimmune disease 14 (3.9) 3 (7.9) \u2013 9 1,033 samples (52.1%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. in the 2011\u20132012 season, H3N2 was prominent (606, 55.1%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in two patients. the distribution of influenza viruses appeared to be bimodal. 69 (6.3) 7 (4.0) 2 (4.3) 13 (3.9) 16 (9.1) \u2013 \u2013 31 (10.9) Influenza B 169 (15.4) 39 (22.2) 2 (4.3) 38 (11.3) 42 (23.9) 1 (4.3) 1 (1.7) 46 (16.2) Adenovirus 7 (0.6) 1 (0.6) 2 (4.3) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1 (1.7) 3 (1.1) Rhinovirus 86 (7.8) 12 (6.8) 4 (8.7) 27 human metapneumovirus was detected in 86 patients (7.8%), and circulated throughout the entire study period, excluding November and December. most RSV cases occurred in winter, but there were some episodes during spring. in 52 cases, two respiratory viruses were detected concurrently. five patients with influenza A also had two other viruses. one case, six respiratory viruses were found simultaneously. single virus (n = 975) Multiple virus (n = 58) P Influenza vaccination 222 (24.5) 11 (22.9) 1.00 Comorbidity 172 (17.6) 8 (13.8) 0.59 DM 67 (25.7) 1 (8.3) 0.31 Cardiovascular disease 24 (9.2) 2 (16.7) 0.32 Cerebrovascular disease 25 (9.6) 2 (16.7) 0.34 Neuromuscular disease 3 (1.1) 0 (0) 1.00 Chronic kidney disease 12 (4.6) 0 (0) 1 1% of respiratory viruses detected in respiratory specimens from adult patients with ILI were viruses other than influenza viruses. at least one virus was detected in 52.1% of samples in this study. influenza viruses are most likely to be identified. ICU admission and co-infection with human metapneumovirus and RSV was strongly associated with disease severity [16], [17]. viral co-infections were related to an increased probability for hospitalization in children with respiratory infection [14]. however, the impact of detection of multiple respiratory viral infections on clinical outcome has rarely been investigated in adults. edward et al."}
