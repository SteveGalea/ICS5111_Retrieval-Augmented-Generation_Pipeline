{"summary": "enveloped viruses possess proteins dedicated to the regulation and execution of membrane fusion between the viral envelope and target cell membrane. a multi-step process defines what may be a universal pathway to membrane fusion, involving membrane contact (attachment and enforced close apposition), lipid mixing (hemifusion), and content mixing (pore formation and stabilization) retro-, filo-, and coronaviruses assign the initial membrane contact and latter membrane merger stages of the process to separate polypeptide subunits within a homotrimeric protein complex. a slightly different situation occurs in the alphaviruses, where the receptor binding E2 glycoprotein initially forms a heterodimer with the E1 membrane fusion polypeptide. a low pH trigger and insertion of the fusion peptide into target membranes converts E1 to a there are currently three members of the FAST protein family named according to their approximate molecular masses (p10, p14 and p15), all of which assume an Nexoplasmic/Ccytoplasmic membrane topology. as much or more of the mass of the FAST proteins is localized on the distal side of the membrane resulting in small N-terminal ectodomains of only 20\u201340 residues. the p14 FAST protein lacks specific receptor-binding activity. p14-liposomes adhered better to target cells than liposomes lacking the p14 FAST protein. p14-liposomes adhered better to target cells than liposomes lacking the protein. flow cytometry revealed the majority of liposomes contained p14. p14 lacks specific high-affinity receptor-binding activity. p14 lacks specific receptor-binding activity. p14-transfected cells were briefly cultured under low calcium conditions. calcium depletion disrupts homotypic cadherin interactions. low calcium conditions inhibited p14-induced syncytium formation by 7590% in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. calcium depletion inhibits syncytiogenesis under low calcium conditions. cells were transfected with p14, cultured under normal or low calcium conditions. then fixed and Giemsa stained at 8 (QM5) or 20 (MDCK) h. cells, 7 h post-transfection - 200.4; p10 in QM5 cells, 9 h post-transfection - 83.1; p15 in QM5 cells, 13 h post-transfection - 101.6; influenza HA in QM5 cells, 24 h post-transfection, no low pH treatment - 60.9; influenza HA in QM5 cells, low pH treatment at 24 h post-transfection - 293.11. p14-induced cell\u2013cell membrane fusion is calcium-dependent. two populations of QM5 cells, one labelled with calcein red orange AM (Red) and the other expressing EGFP (Green), were co-cultured, transfected with p14 or empty vector, then cultured under normal or low calcium conditions for 3 h. extensive regions of p14 staining did not overlap with cadherins. however, there was clear overlap of a percentage of p14 near regions of intense N-cadherin staining. ablating cadherin expression inhibits p14-mediated syncytiogenesis. the inset shows Western blot analysis of N-cadherin (N-Cad) and actin expression in the cells transfected with control (Cont) or N-cadherin (N-Cad) siRNA. we also noted a correlation between cadherin status in different cell types and the extent of p14-mediated syncytium formation. HT1080 cells induced extensive syncytium formation by 9 h post-transfection. cell\u2013cell fusion did eventually occur in the L cells, becoming detectible by 17\u201320 h post-transfection. even by 24 h post-transfection, p14-induced syncytiogenesis was still only 20% of that obtained in QM5 cells at 8 h post-transfection. p14-induced syncytium formation was examined in the cadherin-deficient L cells and in EL cells, which are L cells stably expressing E-cadherin [34] p14-induced syncytium formation was eliminated when EL cells were cultured under low calcium conditions, suggesting it was directly due to trans-cadherin interactions. the extent of fusion relative to L cells under normal calcium conditions was quantified at 26 h post-transfection by syncytial indexing. the average number of syncytial nuclei per field in the L cells was 40.7. the fusion activity of the cleaved HA protein was unaffected by disrupting cadherin interactions. p14-induced syncytiogenesis in QM5 cells expressing the fusion-inactive influenza HA0 protein was ablated using non-immune horse serum. surface immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that a proportion of p14 co-localized with HAO, including at sites of cell\u2013cell contact, and this colocalization was maintained under low calcium conditions. this results supported the hypothesis that the FAST proteins have evolved to retain the minimal activity required to bring about fusion of closely apposed membranes. microscopy images of epitope-tagged p14 (red) and influenza HA (green) in QM5-HAO cells. yellow indicates regions of p14 and HAO colocalization. syncytiogenesis in EL cells was substantially less than that obtained in QM5 cells. ectopic expression of E-cadherin in EL cells did result in regions of focal cell\u2013cell contact. the actin cytoskeleton in EL cells retained the architecture observed in L cells. this phenotype has been called \u201cpassive adhesion\u201d [37]. low doses of cytoD resulted in partial redistribution of filamentous actin into cytoplasmic actin aggregates. cytoD inhibited p14-induced syncytium formation by >80%. increased concentrations of cytoD resulted in extensive disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of cytoplasmic actin aggregates. cytoD formation of extended cell\u2013cell contacts following calcium depletion and repletion in order to generate the passive adhesion phenotype. fibroblasts were treated with 0 (a), 0.5 (b) or 1 g/ml (c) of cytoD for 30 minutes prior to fixation and staining with fluorescently conjugated phalloidin (green) and propidium iodide (red) low calcium conditions that generated the no adhesion phenotype inhibited p14-induced cell\u2013cell fusion by 80%. incubating cells previously cultured in the absence of calcium resulted in the rapid restoration of active adhesion. this transition of cells from the no-adhesion to passive-adhesion phenotype only partially restored syncytium formation to 50% of the maximum level. p14-mediated fusion better than cells forming passive adhesions. cell cultured under low calcium conditions to disrupt cadherin-mediated cell\u2013cell contacts and generate the no adhesion phenotype. cells cultured under low calcium conditions followed by treatment with cytoD. the average number of syncytial nuclei per field was 68.9 (no cytochalasin treatment) and 46.9 (with cytochalasin treatment) the p14 FAST protein lacks specific receptor-binding activity. the p14 FAST protein lacks specific receptor-binding activity. the p14 FAST protein lacks specific receptor-binding activity. fluorescent liposomes were prepared with (solid line) or without (dashed line) p14. nmol of lipid bound were added to monolayers of QM5 fibroblasts. calcium depletion disrupts homotypic cadherin interactions, resulting in rapid dissociation of cadherin-dependent adhesions without affecting integrin-mediated cell attachment to the substratum. low calcium conditions inhibited p14-induced syncytium formation by 7590% in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. fixed and Giemsa stained at 8 (QM5) or 20 (MDCK) h post-transfection to detect multinucleated syncytia. cells were fixed at various times post-transfection when syncytia were countable. average number of syncytial nuclei per field was determined from Giemsa monolayers. a quantitative pore formation assay was adapted to assess the p14-induced membrane fusion reaction. two independent populations of cells labelled with either green fluorescent protein or calcein red-orange were seeded together, transfected with a p14 expression plasmid. the number of co-fluorescent cells was then quantified by flow cytometry. d, transfected with p14 or empty vector, then cultured under normal or low calcium conditions for 3 h to allow fusion to proceed. the gated populations of co-fluorescent p14-transfected cells shown in the dot plots in panel A were quantified. p14 in the plasma membrane should co-localize at sites of cadherin-mediated adhesion. ablating cadherin expression inhibits p14-mediated syncytiogenesis. cells were surface immunostained for p14 (green), then permeabilized and immunostained for N-cadherin (red) at 4 h post-transfection. p14 co-localized at cell\u2013cell contacts as indicated by the yellow pixels. the VSV G protein is a low pH-activated viral fusion protein. it can gradually induce cell\u2013cell fusion when transiently over-expressed in transfected cells in the absence of a triggering acid treatment. p14-induced syncytium formation was dramatically different in these two cell types. genesis was still only 20% of that obtained in QM5 cells at 8 h post-transfection. cell\u2013cell fusion in the L cells was markedly reduced in both the rate and extent of syncytium formation compared to the cadherin-containing fibroblasts. decreased cadherin expression coincided with a 75% decrease in p14-mediated syncytiogenesis. p14-induced syncytium formation was examined in the cadherin-deficient L cells and in EL cells, which are L cells stably expressing E-cadherin [34] p14-induced cell\u2013cell fusion persisted in fibroblast and epithelial cells. some level of p14-induced cell\u2013cell fusion persisted under low calcium conditions. but some level of p14-induced cell\u2013cell fusion persisted in fibroblast and epithelial cells. fusion activity of the cleaved HA protein was unaffected by disrupting cadherin interactions. p14-induced syncytiogenesis in QM5 cells expressing the fusion-inactive influenza HA0 protein. the presence of HAO resulted in a substantial increase in the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of p14. surrogate receptor binding proteins enhance p14-mediated fusion in absence of cadherin junctions. QM5 and QM5-HAO cells were transfected with p14 and cell\u2013cell fusion under normal (black bars) or low (white bars) calcium conditions were quantified by syncytial indexing at 7 h post-transfection. syncytiogenesis in the EL cells was still substantially less than that obtained in QM5 cells. syncytiogenesis in the EL cells was still substantially less than that obtained in QM5 cells. phenotype was called \"passive adhesion\" at sites of cell contact. there was a correlation between adhesion properties of different cell types and susceptibility to FAST protein-induced cell fusion. low doses of cytoD (0.1\u20130.5 g/ml) resulted in the partial redistribution of filamentous actin into cytoplasmic actin aggregates. the observed 20\u201330% decrease in syncytium formation in cells treated with low doses of cytoD presumably reflected previously reported ability of cytoD to disrupt recently formed, unstable cell\u2013cell contacts. fusion in QM5 cells treated with indicated concentrations of cytoD was quantified at 7 h post-transfection by syncytial indexing. data is presented as the extent of fusion relative to cells untreated with cytoD, set at 100%. synchronytiogenesis in these cells was fully restored to the levels observed in cells that were never incubated under low calcium conditions. the transition of cells from the no-adhesion to passive-adhesion phenotype only partially restored p14-induced syncytium formation to 50% of the maximum level. cells cultured under low calcium conditions to disrupt cadherin-mediated cell\u2013cell contacts and generate the no adhesion phenotype. cells cultured under low calcium conditions followed by treatment with cytoD to allow cadherin engagement but not actin remodelling. the reovirus FAST proteins contain all of the activities necessary to efficiently mediate the fusion of closely apposed membranes. however, in their natural biological context as cell\u2013cell fusogens, the FAST proteins exploit cellular adhesion factors and active actin remodelling for maximum membrane fusion activity. tes red blood cell attachment to cells expressing E1/E2 results in efficient cell\u2013cell fusion. this is best exemplified by certain paramyxoviruses whose F protein can function in the absence of the HN attachment component. membrane attachment is presumably mediated by low pH-triggered exposure of the fusion peptide and insertion into the target membrane [41]\u2013[43] cadherins can clearly serve as surrogate adhesins for the FAST proteins. there is no evidence that the FAST proteins specifically interact or co-localize with cadherins. p14 functions to induce liposome-cell fusion with no requirement for cadherins. membrane attachment and membrane merger stages represent two distinct, uncoupled phases. the first phase is mediated by cellular adhesins that do not directly interact with the FAST protein fusogens. the second phase is mediated by cellular adhesins that do not directly interact with the FAST protein fusogens. cadherin-containing QM5 cells and cadherin-deficient L cells are not involved in cell\u2013cell fusion mediated by these enveloped virus fusion proteins. the actin cytoskeleton can affect virus-cell and/or cell\u2013cell fusion when actin dynamics are altered by manipulating the activity of the Rho family GTPases that regulate cytoskeletal structure. changes in the environment of the two contacting membranes that accompany the transition from passive to active adhesion could exert the fusion protein itself is believed to be responsible for breaching this intermembrane distance. a proposed unifying principle for viral protein-mediated membrane fusion involves refolding of the fusion protein from its metastable pre-fusion conformation to its hairpin-like, post-fusion minimal energy state. mechanical energy serves to pull the membranes into close proximity [24],[25],[28]. membrane proteins from the fusion site can inhibit membrane fusion. reversible solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues in the small ectodomain could alter the hydration layer between membranes. residues in the larger endodomain might contribute to actin remodelling and reduction in intermembrane distances. reoviruses have access to the replication machinery of multiple cell types during a single round of replication. seconding the membrane attachment phase of the fusion reaction to surrogate adhesins would also reduce the genetic commitment on the part of the virus. liposome binding assay Fluorescent liposomes and p14-containing proteoliposomes were prepared exactly as previously described. liposomes (0.4\u20131.6 mM) were incubated with QM5 fibroblasts on ice for 1 h. cells were then resuspended in 10 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. a population of QM5 cells was labelled with 20 M calcein red-orange AM (Molecular Probes), mixed 11 with a second population of cells stably expressing EGFP (Clontech) cells were subjected to calcium depletion at 3 h post-transfection, just prior to the onset of syncytiogenesis. cell lysates were fixed with methanol at 9 h post-p14 transfection. fusion was quantified by syncytial indexing as described above. images were captured using a Typhoon imaging system (Amersham) and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) active adhesion was obtained by culturing cells in growth medium containing normal calcium levels with or without 0.1 g/ml cytoD. no adhesion was generated by calcium depletion followed by incubation in calcium-free media in the presence and absence of 0.1 g/ml cytoD. fusion was triggered with MEM or S-MEM at pH 4.8. cells were transferred to MEM or S-MEM with 10% dFBS to allow syncytia to progress (20\u201340 min), then fixed with methanol, Giemsa-stained and syncytia were quantified. cell\u2013cell fusion was allowed to gradually progress without a specific low pH treatment to activate fusion. liposome binding assay Fluorescent liposomes and p14-containing proteoliposomes were prepared exactly as previously described. liposomes (0.4\u20131.6 mM) were incubated with QM5 fibroblasts on ice for 1 h. cells were then resuspended in 10 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the control wells had progressed to 50\u2013250 syncytial nuclei per microscopic field (200 magnification) this level of cell\u2013cell fusion was determined to give the most accurate and reproducible results. results are reported as the percent fusion relative to the indicated control treatment, set at 100%. cells were fixed with methanol at 3\u20134 h post-p14 transfection. some wells were depleted of extracellular calcium to disrupt cadherin-mediated contacts. images were captured and quantified using a Typhoon imaging system (Amersham) active adhesion was obtained by culturing cells in growth medium containing normal calcium levels with or without 0.1 g/ml cytoD. no adhesion was generated by calcium depletion followed by incubation in calcium-free media in the presence of 0.1 g/ml cytoD. Fusion was triggered with MEM or S-MEM at pH 4.8. cells were then transferred to MEM or S-MEM with 10% dFBS. cell\u2013cell fusion was allowed to gradually progress without a specific low pH treatment to activate fusion."}
