{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease. HFMD typically presents as a mild febrile disease with a localized rash. some patients may develop infection of the central nervous system (CNS) unliganded EV71 3C protease folded into two domains related to other picornaviral 3C protease structures. the complex structures of EV71 mutants are similar to that of the unliganded protease structure (24). EV71 3C protease is an attractive target for antiviral discovery (22) EV71 3C protease cleaved TSAVLQSGFRKM more efficiently than the other six substrates. eight peptides derived from CVA16 polyprotein and three peptides derived from EV71 polyprotein were also investigated for their susceptibilities to 3C cleavage via HPLC assay. the peptide substrate Dabcyl-RTATVQGPSLDFKE-Edans showed the best EV71 3C protease protease proteolytic activity. the peptide showed a low cleavage rate and a low kinetic constant kcat/Km of 11.8 0.82 mM1 min1. compared with the previously reported substrates, P08 gave the highest signal-to-background. a reliable and robust biochemical assay with a Z\u2032 factor of 0.87 0.05 was developed. the cDNA encoding the EV71 3C protease (aa 1 to 183) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the genomic RNA of EV71. the supernatant was loaded onto a 15-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated in lysis buffer. the nonspecific contaminants were then removed by washing with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer. the eluate was further purified with a superdex 200 gel filtration column. ene-1-sulfonic acid (Edans) and 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl (NMA) are the fluorescent donor moieties. p-(p-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (Dabcyl) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) are the quencher moieties. the ratio of the final fluorescence signal of the mixture to the background of the substrate (S/B) was calculated to quickly characterize the cleavage efficiencies of substrates. the initial velocities were calculated for all of the cleavage peptides from three independent experiments. EV71 3C protease was determined by assays in buffer containing DMSO concentrations varying from 0.5% to 10% (vol/vol) all reactions were performed in triplicate to determine the effects of salt concentration, pH, temperature, and DMSO on protease enzymatic activity. each solvated complex was equilibrated by 60 ps of heating from 0 K to 300 K and 60 ps of density equilibration. both simulations were run with a 2-fs time step, 10-kcal mol1 2 constraints on the complex. the final phase of equilibration of every system was used to run a 3-ns molecular dynamics simulation. s and c are the means for the positive and negative controls, respectively. s and c are the means for the positive and negative controls. s and c are the means for the positive and negative controls. pcDNA6-FY-capsid and pEV71-Luc-replicon lacking the P1 region were produced. pcDNA6-FY-capsid was transfected into HEK-293T cells at 60 to 80% confluence. after 24 h posttransfection, EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA was then transfected. RD cells (3 104 per well in 100 l 10% FBS\u2013DMEM) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 overnight. EV71(FY)-Luc virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 was added to 96-well plates. luminescence was measured at 490 nm after 24 h postinfection. cDNA encoding the EV71 3C protease (aa 1 to 183) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the genomic RNA of EV71 (EV71 isolate BJ/CHN/2008; GenBank accession no. ADT71698.1) as the template and cloned into the NdeI and NotI sites of the pET28a expression vector (GE Healthcare) fluorogenic peptide library, P01 to P17, developed by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc [N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl] techniques. cleavage of peptide from 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin and removal of side chain protecting groups were achieved in trifluoroacetic acid solution. cleavage activity of purified EV71 3C protease was determined in a reaction volume of 100 l, using 10 l enzyme (50 M) and 10 l peptides (maximum concentration, 5 mM) in the reaction buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) the instrument was precalibrated with the free fluorescent moiety Edans or NMA standard to calculate the relationship between fluorescence unit and substrate concentration. the initial velocities were calculated for all of the cleavage peptides from three independent experiments. no significant hydrolysis of the peptide substrates was observed in absence of EV71 3C protease. the ligand peptides were positioned in the protein similar to the position in the work by Lu et al. (25), which solved the crystal structure of the CVA16 3C protease with the peptide FAGLRQAVTQ (PDB 3SJ9) we aligned the structure of 4GHQ, maintained the coordinates of the backbone and -carbon of 3SJ9's ligand. equilibration was run to refine the interactions of receptor and ligand. in the first 0.5 ns, the distances of all the hydrogen bonds between residues of receptor and all the main chains of ligand were restrained. in the remaining 0.5 ns, a 2-kcal mol1 2 constraint was set on the complex to avoid a significant structure change. EV71 3C protease was used as the substrate for the enzyme inhibition assay. the assays were performed with 100-l samples containing 1 M protease, 20 M substrate, and various concentrations (10 M to 0.156 M) of the tested compounds. the reaction mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 30\u00b0C. the EV71 pseudotype virus was produced by using a method developed as previously described (11, 37) the pEV71-Luc subgenomic replicon RNA transcripts were prepared in vitro by using Ambion MEGAscript kits. c50s of compounds were calculated using log (concentration) versus luminescence (490 nm) in GraphPad Prism. recombinant protease was expressed and purified as described previously. the protease was purified by HPLC with a retention volume of 17 ml. a major protein with molecular mass of 22 kDa indicates that recombinant EV71 3C protease was obtained with over 95% purity. cleavage activity of the EV71 3C protease was assayed by fluorescence release from a set of synthesized fluorogenic peptide substrates. the peptides P03 (NMA-RTATVQGPSLDFK-DNP) and P04 (NMA-TSAVLQSGFRK(DNP)M) were obtained to test in vitro cleavage activity against EV71 protease compared with the reported substrates. a slightly improved S/B ratio was observed for the peptide P03 (S/B, 6.5) compared to the corresponding peptide P01 (S/B, the substrate peptide P08 showed much lower cleavage efficiency, with an S/B value of 3.6, which corresponds to the 2A-2B junction. the substrate P07 showed much lower cleavage efficiency, with an S/B value of 3.6. matic activity was observed against the substrate peptides P06 and P09 (S/B, 1.8) representing the VP1-VP3 and 3A-3B junction sites. matic activity was observed against the substrate peptides P06 and P09 (S/B, 1.8) peptide P16 showed poor cleavage efficiency (S/B, 8.2 and 9.7). EV71 3C protease showed strong preference for the P2 and P1\u2032 residues. peptide P16 showed poor cleavage efficiency (S/B, 2.0) the effects of DMSO on protease activity are shown in Fig. 3B. the maximum fluorescence was observed within 2 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C. the optimal temperature for protease activity is considered 30\u00b0C. EV71 3C protease showed much higher enzymatic activity against the substrate P08. kcat/Km (mM1 min1) was the most suitable substrate for EV71 protease cleavage.

Arg39, located at the bottom of the S2 pocket, provided different orientations depending on the appearance of a benzene ring in the P2 side chain. a Glu-to-Phe mutation showed a 5-fold reduction of cleavage efficiency. the protease contacted with the protease only by a hydrogen bond formed with the backbone of Asn126. a Z\u2032 factor of >0.5 means a robust and reliable indicator for high-throughput screening assay (32). two published compounds (compounds 1 and 2) and one novel compound (compound 3) were synthesized to evaluate their inhibitory activities against EV71 3C protease. the inhibitory activity of each compound was examined using peptide P08 as the substrate. the inhibitory activity of each compound was examined using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader. EV71 3C protease was expressed and purified as described previously. no amino acid substitutions were introduced in the recombinant protease sequence. lysate was induced with isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 14 h. the ratios of signal to background were used to quickly evaluate the cleavage efficiency of EV71 3C protease against the peptide substrates. a shorter-wavelength FRET pair, NMA/DNP, was chosen for our study to improve the signal-to-background ratio (38) peptides derived from the polyprotein of EV71 Peptide Sequence Cleavage site S/B Mutational peptides Peptide Sequence S/B P01 Dabcyl-RTATVQGPSLDFKE-Edans 3B-3C 5.7 P11 NMA-IAALFQGPPK(DNP)FR 4.6 P02 Dabcyl-TSAVLQSGFRKM-Edans SARS-CoV 2.2 P the substrate peptide P08 represents the native EV71 protease cleavage sites at the 2C-3A junction. the substrate P07 showed much lower cleavage efficiency, with an S/B value of 3.6, which corresponds to the 2A-2B junction. P10 was only moderately hydrolyzed by 3C protease (S/B, 6.8). cleavage was less efficient than that of P08 (S/B, 15.3). seven site-directed peptide variants, P11 to P17, showed relatively lower activity (S/B, 4.6) changes in salt concentration from 100 mM to 500 mM NaCl produced little effect on the enzymatic activity. the combination of salt concentration and pH value that gave the highest proteolytic activity was 150 mM NaCl and pH 7.0. these reaction conditions were then applied throughout the downstream assay development. s were determined in order to quantify the cleavage efficiency and substrate specificity of EV71 3C protease. for the control substrates, the Km and kcat values of P01 were determined to be 82.5 M and 0.12 min1, respectively. for the control substrate P02, the Km and kcat could not be precisely determined because of its low activity. 58.2 4.7 0.21 0.08 3.6 0.72 P04 NMA-TSAVLQSGFRK(DNP)M 75 3.2 0. 02 0.008 0.27 0.07 P05 NMA-RQAVTQGFPTELK-DNP 92.4 5.3 0.2 0.02 2.2 0.13 P06 NMA-DEAMEQGVSDYIK-DNP 73.5 6.1 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.11 P08 NMA-IEALFQGPPK(DNP molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking were applied to build structural models of the complexes. we docked the P6 to P1\u2032 portions of the peptides into the substrate-binding groove of EV71 3C protease for molecular dynamics simulation. the side chain of P1-Gln formed three strong hydrogen bonds (2.5 to 3.0) with these two residues. the hydrophobic S2 pocket is large enough to accommodate various side chains of the substrate. the best selectivity is for the relative large hydrophobic residue Phe, as observed with P08. 71 protease proteolysis process (24) should partially account for the observed dramatically reduced activity with the variant of Phe to Ala or Lys at the P2 position. the backbone of the protease interacted with Gly164 of the protease via two hydrogen bonds. the Z\u2032 factor was obtained from 60 independent positive controls containing 20 M P08 and 1 M protease. the assay was performed using 20 M substrate P08 [NMA-IEALFQGPPK(DNP)FR] with 1 M protease (positive control) and without protease (negative control) we synthesized a novel compound (compound 3) with a 2-chloride-phenylacetyl substitution instead of the cinnamoyl of compound 1. the biological analysis revealed that the efficacy of compound 3 (IC50 = 1.89 0.25 M) is twice that reported for compounds 1 and 2. the control fluorogenic peptide substrates P01 and P02 and 15 novel peptide substrates based on the cleavage sites of EV71 protease. the substrates P01 and P02 exhibited inconsistent cleavage efficiency in the previous studies. the novel peptide substrate P08 was determined to be the most efficient substrate among all tested peptides. 1\u2032-P5 residues within the peptide P08 could lead to a decrease in cleavage efficiency. replacement of Gly at the P1\u2032 position of P08 by Ser led to a dramatic decrease in the cleavage efficiency. Arg39 maintains the original conformation in other MD modes of substrates without Phe at the P2 position. a novel compound (compound 3) was synthesized to validate the assay for the screening of EV71 protease inhibitors. biochemical assay was further validated by the determination of low IC50s of three synthesized EV71 3C protease inhibitors."}
