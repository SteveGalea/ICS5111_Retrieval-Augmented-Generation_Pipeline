{"summary": "every year about two and half million practising Muslims attend the annual Hajj pilgrimage. the risk is increased by travel (for some long and arduous), severe crowding at Hajj, the weather and the stress of Hajj rituals. the weeklong Hajj consists of intricate religious rituals during the final month of the Islamic lunar calendar. 125 research articles were identified including case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. of the 125 articles, 27 (21.6%) dealt with respiratory tract infections including 15 (12%) papers on laboratory-proven influenza. jeddi et al. first documented influenza at Hajj using serology when in 1975 4% of Tunisian pilgrims were shown to have had recent influenza. PCR-based surveillance reported attack rates ranging from 6% to 38% depending on study design. a recent study reported a fairly high attack rate of seasonal influenza (10%) among 275 Iranian pilgrims returning from the Hajj 2009 all of whom received seasonal influenza vaccine. the dominance of seasonal influenza is likely to be due to the large proportion of pilgrims 50 or older with cross-immunity to H1N1.15 Bacterial infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis and Haemophilus influenza the prevalence of diabetes, bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive airway disease is 12%, 9% and 9% respectively. pharmaceutical measures are vaccinations against influenza and other concomitant infections such as pneumococcal disease, and the use of antivirals. a recent systematic review showed a pooled efficacy of seasonal influenza of 59% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51\u201367) in adults aged 18\u201365 years and a median pH1N1 vaccine effectiveness of 69% (range 60\u201393) in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 the seasonal influenza vaccine included the pH1N1 strain so that only one shot was necessary and not separate monovalent vaccines. most pilgrims at risk of pneumococcal infection are unvaccinated. neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the drugs of choice. influenza surveillance enables better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in the community and this accurate up-to date information guides and targets appropriate interventions. a number of near-patient tests of pH1N1 influenza have been evaluated in the USA, all showing moderate sensitivity (38\u201353%) but high specificity (86\u2013100%) the authors suggested that a large multicentre trial conducted for multiple years is needed to provide an answer. this could build on a successful pilot study undertaken among Australian pilgrims during the Hajj 2011. the commonly used trivalent influenza vaccines are directed against two strains of influenza A and one strain of B. they are most effective when circulating influenza viruses are well-matched with vaccine strains. a new vaccine closely matching the circulating antigenic configuration must be developed, produced and procured for each new influenza season. the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) is currently recommended in many developed countries for use in all adults who are 65 years and also for persons aged 2 years at high risk for disease. most (>95%) pilgrims at risk of pneumococcal infection are unvaccinated. tancy Group recommended treatment for all inpatients and outpatients at high risk of severe complications from pH1N1 or seasonal influenza. oseltamivir reported to have a protective efficacy of 81% against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza in household contacts of cases. ring postexposure prophylaxis, in which only the close contacts of cases are targeted, is probably the only workable strategy. influenza vaccine included the pH1N1 strain so that only one shot was necessary and not separate monovalent vaccines. in 2006, the rate of influenza among Iranian as well as Saudi pilgrims was 10% with widely varying reported vaccine uptakes of 86% and 4%. antiviral drugs are available in some countries for its treatment and prophylaxis. neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the drugs of choice. the neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir, are the drugs of choice. influenza surveillance enables better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in the community and accurate up-to date information guides and targets appropriate interventions. a number of near-patient tests of pH1N1 influenza have been evaluated in the USA, all showing moderate sensitivity (38\u201353%) but high specificity (86\u2013100%) for five days 164 pilgrims aged 15 years and over were recruited from 24 tents in mina. this was a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission of influenza-like illness. a number of near-patient tests of pH1N1 influenza have been evaluated in the USA. so far only one named near-patient test for seasonal influenza has been evaluated at Hajj with low sensitivity (22%) but high specificity (86\u2013100%) for five days 164 pilgrims aged 15 years and over were recruited from 24 tents in mina. a recent cochrane review supports simple and low-cost interventions, particularly hand hygiene, reducing the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. information from the Hajj 2009 showing low rates of pH1N1 suggests that older pilgrims had some cross-immunity to pH1N1 from previous H1N1 influenza A infection. many with known risk factors, including pregnant women, heeded the official advice from the Ministry of Hajj to avoid Hajj 2009. the other authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in relation to this work Funding None declared Ethical approval Not applicable Guarantor EH Contributorship
