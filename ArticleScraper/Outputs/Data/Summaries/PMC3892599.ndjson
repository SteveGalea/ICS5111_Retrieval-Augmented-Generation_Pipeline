{"summary": "the epidemic spanned a large geographical extent (170 counties of 22 provinces) but clustered in two areas. Figure 1 shows the temporal distribution of SARS in the six most seriously affected geographic areas of mainland China. the average duration (3.8 days) and pattern (with time of epidemic and age) of onset of symptoms to hospital admission of SARS patients in mainland China were comparable to other affected areas. the duration of hospital admission to discharge for those who survived (29.7 days) was shorter than elsewhere in the world, possibly because of different hospitalisation policies. the relatively young age of the cases (median age 33 years) only partly explains the low CFR in mainland China compared to other countries and areas affected by SARS. median age varied from 37 years in Singapore to 49 years in canada. the characteristics of the SARS outbreak in mainland China and other countries or regions in 2003. data concern probable cases. Figure 3 shows Rt over time for mainland China. the first official report of an outbreak in Guangdong (arrow 3) and the WHO global alerts (arrow 4) were by no means reflected in a consistent reduction of Rt. the first interventions in Beijing were not effective enough to cause any downward trend in the transmission. estimates of effective reproduction number (Rt) during the SARS epidemic in china. values represent average Rt (central white line) and associated 95% (grey) and 80% (black) confidence intervals. avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) and corticosteroid treatment given to patients with SARS were studied for Beijing by Beutels et al.21. there were many obvious immediate consequences of the epidemic, such as substantial morbidity and mortality, fear for becoming infected, panic in the public domain, stringent quarantine measures. the use of corticosteroids and other drugs (e.g. ribavirin) has been debated. it has remained uncertain how the aggressive use of corticosteroids during the SARS epidemic has tipped the balance. the government has also increased their investment into enhancing the capabilities in detection, diagnosis, prevention and control of newly emerging infectious diseases at various levels. funding for research projects on the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic techniques has been granted to develop new approaches in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of emerging infectious diseases."}
