{"summary": "introduction dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of innate immunity. there are two known major subsets of primary human and murine circulating DCs. myeloid DCs function principally in antigen presentation. plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) secret type I interferons (IFN), IFN and IFN. pDCs activate natural killer cells [15], macrophages [16] and T and B cells [17], [18], presumably, in part, through IFN stimulus. pDCs may have additional antiviral effects, including direct inhibition of viral replication in target cells secondary to the secretion of type I IFN [19], [20], [21]. the outer layer of the virion is composed of the VP7 glycoprotein and protease-sensitive VP4 spikes. only TLPs are infectious due to the requirements of VP4 and VP7 for cell binding and trypsin cleavage of VP4 for viral entry and infectivity. the nonstructural proteins (NSP1 through 5) are involved in viral replication, morphogenesis and assembly. several rotaviruses, including RRV, have recently been demonstrated to antagonize the production of type I IFN. rotavirus activates detectable transcription and translation in only a small percentage of pDCs. this response is dependent on the presence of the viral dsRNA genome. expression of NSP2 was not detected in pDCs receiving MA104 supernatant (mock-treated; Figure 1A) or iRRV (data not shown), but was expressed in a small but significant percentage (mean SEM, moi 5: 1.18%0.23 6hpi, 1.43%0.28 12hpi; moi 10: 1.45%0.25 6hpi, 3.02%0.99 12hpi) of pDCs exposed to live RRV pDCs from multiple donors were titered after overnight culture to determine whether rotavirus infection was productive. pDC viability was significantly decreased from 6 to 12hpi in cultures receiving mock, RRV (moi 5) or iRRV stimulus (p0.004; Mann-Whitney), viral exposure did not result in significant cell death compared to mock stimulus. p0.125 vs. mock; Wilcoxon signed rank test. pDCs activate and mature following RRV stimulation. pDCs activate and mature following inoculation with rotavirus. ability of live or inactivated RRV (moi 5), or CpG 2395 (4 g/ml), to stimulate pDCs was assessed by flow cytometry for expression of activation (A, C, CD86) or maturation (B, D, CD83) markers 12h following stimulus. expression of CD86 (E, G) and CD83 (F, H) by NSP2+ and bystander (NSP2-) pDCs was subsequently assessed. IFN was detected intracellularly at similar frequencies in pDCs exposed to iRRV (p = 0.815; Mann-Whitney) intracellular IFN was abrogated by the addition of RRV neutralizing VP7 or VP4 monoclonal antibodies (either mAb 159 or 2G4), suggesting that the observed induction was virus-specific and likely dependent on an event occurring after virus binding and entry. IP10), CCL3 (MIP1), CCL4 (MIP1), CCL5 (RANTES) and TNF were detected at various times post infection. together, these data suggest that live or inactivated RRV rapidly induce production of significant levels of IFN and other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by pDCs. sCD40L: no observed increase versus mock stimulus. IFN production is impaired in pDCs undergoing RRV replication. donors with fewer than 0.5% of pDCs staining positive for NSP2 were excluded from this analysis. representative histograms of IRF7 phosphorylation in NSP2bright (red), NSP2dim (blue), and NSP2- (green) pDCs 6 hours post RRV or mock (gray) stimulus. decrease in pIRF7 was due to decreased levels of total IRF7 in pDCs. increased levels of pIRF7 in pDCs may represent direct stimulus of the IRF7 pathway in virus-positive pDCs. pIRF7 may be sequestered in a nontraditional compartment prior to degradation. ation decreased the percent of IFN+ pDCs by an average of 63.5%. this is the first demonstration of impaired IRF phosphorylation in primary human cells infected with rotavirus. trypsin-mediated cleavage of VP4 is dispensable for pDC infection. pDCs exposed to equal quantities of non-trypsinized RRV (NT-RRV) cleavage of VP4 by trypsin dispensable for both pDC infection and IFN induction by RRV. only documented viral TLR ligands for pDCs are ssRNA and DNA [2], [3], [7], [8], [9]. pDCs exposed to 2/6 genome-containing RRV DLPs expressed neither IFN nor NSP2. pDCs were stimulated with 2/4/6/7 VLPs or 2/6/7 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VLPs. both were capable of entering pDCs, but failed to induce IFN. IFN production by pDCs exposed to empty particles was consistent with that observed in pDCs inoculated with an equal infectious dose of TLPs. these data suggest that viral entry, mediated by VP4 and/or VP7, and the viral dsRNA genome are likely required for rotavirus-induced IFN production. concanamycin-treated pDCs were examined for NSP2 expression. the lack of IFN production was due to a defect in viral entry. concanamycin-induced inhibition of endosomal acidification does not inhibit viral infection. a subpopulation of human primary peripheral pDCs is permissive to RRV replication. pDCs were purified from human blood by negative selection. expression of NSP2 was detected by intracellular flow cytometry at 6 and 12 hours post infection (hpi) two populations of NSP2+ cells, NSP2dim and NSP2bright, were frequently apparent in pDCs exposed to live RRV. approximately 20% of donors had only a single NSP2dim population. pDCs from multiple donors were titered after overnight culture to determine whether rotavirus infection was productive. the low frequency of NSP2+ pDCs shows that the majority of human peripheral pDCs are resistant to RRV replication. rhesus rotavirus (RRV) in pDCs was assessed by intracellular staining for NSP2. pG ODN 2395 resulted in activation of a significantly greater percentage of the pDC population than those exposed to RRV (p = 0.03; Wilcoxon signed rank test) the percent of pDCs matured by CpG ODN 2395 stimulus was also increased, but not significantly compared to those exposed to RRV. the expression of CD86 (E, G) and CD83 (F, H) by NSP2+ and bystander (NSP2-) pDCs was subsequently assessed. the expression of CD86 (E, G) and CD83 (F) pDCs was subsequently assessed. Luminex assays or ELISAs were performed on supernatants collected from inoculated pDCs at various times post infection. a significant IFN response, approaching 10,000 pg IFN/ml, was detectable 6h following exposure to live or inactivated RRV. together, these data suggest that live or inactivated RRV rapidly induce production of significant levels of IFN. pDCs exposed to RRV in presence of neutralizing VP4 (2G4) or VP7 (159) mAb. IFN production is impaired in pDCs undergoing RRV replication. the percent of IFN+ pDCs was significantly increased in the NSP2dim population compared to that in the NSP2bright (p = 0.0006; Wilcoxon signed rank test) more significant was the sustained production of IFN in uninfected (NSP2-) pDCs following RRV stimulus. pIRF7 is phosphorylated in pDCs supporting low levels of viral replication. phosphorylation of IRF7 was assessed by phosflow (Figure 5D and 5E) inhibition of IFN secretion, achieved by simultaneous addition of brefeldin A with viral inoculation, decreased the percent of IFN+ pDCs by an average of 63.5%. this is the first demonstration of impaired IRF phosphorylation in primary human cells infected with rotavirus. trypsin-mediated cleavage of VP4 by trypsin is dispensable for both pDC infection and IFN induction by RRV. pDCs exposed to RRV grown in the absence of trypsin (non-trypsinized; NT-RRV) pDCs were exposed to RRV grown in the absence of trypsin. pDCs exposed to 2/6 genome-containing RRV DLPs expressed neither IFN nor NSP2 for viral entry. pDCs exposed to cleaved or uncleaved RRV expressed neither IFN nor NSP2. pDCs were stimulated with 2/4/6/7 VLPs or 2/6/7 VLPs. both were capable of entering pDCs, but failed to induce IFN. 2/6 VLPs were comparatively defective in the ability to enter pDCs. the ability of infectious SA11, the parental virus from which the 2/4/6/7 VLPs were derived, to induce IFN production. pDCs were treated with concanamycin A, a potent inhibitor of endosomal acidification, prior to inoculation with either live or inactivated RRV at an moi of 10. pDCs were examined for NSP2 expression in concanamycin-treated pDCs compared to untreated cells. the observed low levels of viral replication in pDCs are due, at least in part, to suppression by the pDC IFN response. endosomal acidification is required for the pDC IFN response to rotavirus. pDCs play a vital role in the generation of innate and adaptive immunity following viral infection. rotaviruses represent a large burden of human disease. it will be important to better understand the immune mechanisms underlying their recognition and subsequent generation of antiviral immunity. functionally-distinct pDC subsets have been recently identified on the basis of CD2 expression. studies are currently underway to elucidate the role of these subsets in the pDC response to rotavirus. pDCs retained several important functional abilities following RRV exposure. exposure to rotavirus induces IFN secretion by pDCs [39] and total human PBMCs [42] it was unclear until now whether pDCs produced IFN directly in response to virus or if pDCs amplified IFN production in response to type I IFN. pDCs singly positive for IFN, but also cells double-positive for rotavirus and IFN at a greater frequency than that reported here. this conclusion is supported by the observed lack of significant increase in the NSP2+ or IFN+ pDC populations when the moi is increased to 25 or 100. the decrease in IFN and pIRF7 in pDCs expressing high levels of NSP2 illustrates that the local suppression of the interferon response by actively replicating virus is conserved in human pDCs at an individual cell level. however, inhibition in this minor population is unlikely to substantially modulate the amount of cytokine rhesus rotavirus effectively stimulate secretion of type I IFN. this is supported by the inability of genome-free TLPs to effect IFN secretion. this is the first direct demonstration of the requirement for native viral dsRNA. virus mRNA or protein expression provides a mechanism by which the host could effectively circumvent the anti-IFN effects of NSP1-mediated IRF degradation. at least three possible mechanisms exist for this phenotype: first, input or self nucleic acid released from necrotic or apoptotic cells may serve as PAMPs in neighboring cells, as has been previously described. signaling by a cytosolic receptor should be abrogated if inhibition of endosomal acidification in turn prevented rotavirus entry into the cytosol. however, the substantial reduction of the IFN response following concanamycin A treatment supports the notion that an endosomal receptor, such as TLR7 or TLR9, is involved in the pDC response to rotavirus. pDCs exposed to either live or inactivated rotavirus secrete approximately 10 ng/mL of IFN by 6hpi. the recognition of secreted IFN is an important component of the amplification of the pDC IFN response to both live and inactivated rotavirus. replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and human respiratory syncytial virus has been demonstrated to be required for IFN induction in pDC-derived type I IFN plays a critical role in restricting rotavirus replication to the intestine while initiating the systemic immune response in the periphery. the pDC response is demonstrated to require both the viral dsRNA genome and acidification of the pDC endosome, implying the likely initiation of the type I IFN response by TLR7 or TLR9. rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a valuable experimental system for the study of cellular processes, receptors and signaling pathways underlying pDC-mediated antiviral immunity. these findings also provide the first indication that rotavirus infection is capable of locally suppressing IFN production in primary human cells. infected cultures were collected 5\u20137 days post infection and purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. the protein concentration of the purified VLP preparations was estimated by the Bradford method. psoralen preparations were titrated by plaque assay on MA104 cells. TLPs, unpurified RRV and 2/4/6/7 VLPs were treated with 20 nM of EDTA. pDCs were isolated from leukoreduction chambers obtained from the Stanford Blood Center. an average of 2 million pDCs isolated per donor; preparations were routinely >85% pure. rotavirus infection was blocked using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to VP5 (mAb 2G4) or VP7 (mAb 159), or as a non-neutralizing control, a VP6 monoclonal antibody (mAb 1E11) pDCs were washed 3 times, and were frozen immediately or after overnight culture. pDCs were defined as lineage-HLA-DR+CD11c-CD123+. intracellular staining was performed with antibodies to IFN, total IRF7, phosphorylated IRF7 (pS477/pS479) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), IFN or NSP2 (mAb 191) ed IFN was detected by ELISA, per manufacturer's instructions. a p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. rotaviruses were grown in fetal monkey kidney cells in the presence of trypsin. baculoviruses expressed RF (bovine rotavirus) VP6, RRV VP7 or a fusion protein consisting of GFP fused to the N terminus of RF VP2 deleted in the first 92 amino acids. infected cultures were collected 5\u20137 days post infection and purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. pDCs were negatively selected using the pDC Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. an average of 2 million pDCs, defined as viable, lineage-HLA-DR+CD11c-CD123+ cells, were isolated per donor. pDC culture, infection, stimulation and blocking studies. highly-purified pDCs were exposed to RRV at an moi of 10 for one hour. neutralizing mAb 159 was then added for 30 minutes. pDC pellets and supernatants were freeze/thawed three times. phosphorylated IRF7 (pS477/pS479) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), IFN (Antigenix America, Huntington Station, NY) or NSP2 (mAb 191) was considered to be indicative of rotaviral replication in those cells.
