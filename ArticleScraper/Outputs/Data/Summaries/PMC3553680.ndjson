{"summary": "patients with hematologic diseases are likely to be at increased risk of infection with respiratory viruses (1\u20133) progression to LRTI is associated with high mortality and morbidity (4). neuraminidase inhibitors have been widely used in severe influenza infections. but limited antiviral agents are available against noninfluenza respiratory viruses. respiratory virus PCR tests were routinely performed in the asan medical center. patients who were PCR positive for respiratory viruses were identified from the computerized database of the clinical microbiology unit. the study was approved by our hospital ethical committee. oral ribavirin was given at a dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of body weight per day in three divided doses (4). treatment was continued until patients were asymptomatic or virus was not detected. a propensity score was estimated by fitting a logistic regression model. y matching algorithm matches each patient receiving ribavirin treatment with one not receiving ribavirin treatment. if this cannot be done, the algorithm proceeds sequentially to the next highest digit match to make \u201csecond-best\u201d matches. a logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was performed. upper respiratory infection was defined as detection of viruses in upper or lower respiratory secretions. lower respiratory infection was defined as the presence of either hypoxia or pulmonary infiltrates. pneumonia severity index (PSI) (12) and Curb-65 (13) were evaluated to predict the prognosis of patients. a propensity score for each patient\u2014the probability of receiving treatment\u2014was estimated by fitting a multiple logistic regression model. for the propensity-matched case-control study, patients who received oral ribavirin treatment were matched with patients in the untreated group by the Greedy matching algorithm. a logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed to reduce the effect of selection bias in assignment for oral ribavirin therapy. all tests of significance were two tailed, and a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. the baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table 1. median yrs (IQR) 47 (35\u201358) 53 (40\u201361) 0.09 55 (45\u201368) 50 (39\u201360) 0.23 Male gender 67 (59) 14 (45) 0.18 11 (53) 10 (47) >0.99 Site of infection 0.75 0.51 Upper respiratory infection 37 (32) 11 (35) 5 (24) 8 (38) Lower respiratory infection 77 (68) 20 (65) 16 (76) 13 (62) Diagnosis 0.12 >0.99 Acute myeloid 9) 5 (24) 4 (19) Minimal residual 19 (17) 3 (10) 2 (10) 2 (10) Persistent/relapse 73 (64) 15 (48) 10 (47) 12 (57) Unclear 8 (7) 4 (13) 4 (19) 3 (14) McCabe score 0.02 >0.99 Initial ANC (/mm3), median (IQR) 2 (2\u20132) 2 (2\u20133) 0.71 2 (2\u20133) 2 (2\u20132) 0.96 Curb-65 0.97 >0.99 Score 0 39 1,984 (336\u20136,950) 1,270 (180\u20132,670) 0.47 Initial creatinine, median (IQR) 0.7 (0.6\u20131.0) 0.7 (0.6\u20131.5) 0.23 0.8 (0.7\u20131.0) 0.6 (0.6\u20130.9) 0.57 Initial bilirubin 0.9 (0.6\u20131.5) 0.8 (0.7\u20131.5) 0.93 1.2 (0.8\u20131.9) 0.8 (0.7\u20131.8) 0.27 Use of intravenous immunoglobulin 31 (27) treatment with oral ribavirin took place for a median duration of 12 days. the oral ribavirin was used at a median dose of 900 mg (IQR, 900 to 1,200) daily. follow-up RT-PCR examination was carried out on 75 patients.
