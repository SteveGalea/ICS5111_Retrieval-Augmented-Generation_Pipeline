{"summary": "the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center is located in abashiri-Gun, Hokkaido. it has 2 abattoirs, which receive 150,000 to 200,000 pigs annually for slaughtering. the carcasses harboring intestines with nodular caseous necrosis are diagnosed with swine mycobacteriosis. the variation in the number of condemned intestines among days of the week was assessed using a generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson errors. all the statistics in the present study were performed using statistic software R (version 3.0.1) the ARIMA model selected based on the AIC was checked using the Ljung-Box test [19] to ensure that the residuals were independent and temporally equally distributed over time. the stationarity was checked by calculating the roots for the characteristic polynomial using the polyroot function in R [14], confirming that the nontrivial roots were greater than 1. we replaced the last actual condemned numbers of the training phase with an equal number of the numbers generated randomly as follows. the numbers were drawn from a Poisson distribution with the shape parameter lambda () of the 8-year observed data at the training phase and were subtracted by week ensemble average. we then re-fitted the ARIMA model for the updated AR and MA based on the least AIC. the daily number of pigs slaughtered was consistent (Table 1), the daily number of condemned intestines was highest on Mondays, followed by Tuesdays. the number of condemned intestines was highest on Mondays, followed by Tuesdays. the variation of condemnation rate among the days exceeded the overall average condemnation rate. day of the week The number of days Daily number of condemnation Monday 207 11.3 (4.0\u201328.7) Tuesday 134 9.7 (3.0\u201327.0) Wednesday 56 7.7 (3.4\u201324.8) Thursday 81 8.5 (3.0\u201321.0) Friday 111 7.4 (3.0\u201318.5) Saturday 6 7.8 (4.1\u201316.6) Sunday 0 0 Table 3 shows total number of producers, total days the t-tests for significance of coefficients showed that the coefficients of all the options of AR: 1\u20133 and MR: 1\u20134 were significantly different from zero. the t-tests for significance of coefficients showed that the coefficients of all the options of AR: 1\u20133 were significantly different from zero. the number of days when the actual number of condemned intestines exceeded the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was three in fiscal year 2011 and 17 in fiscal year 2012. the minimum, median and maximum numbers of daily condemned intestines of these 20 days were 13, 18.5 and 49, respectively. this values exceeded the overall mean number (which was 2.05) for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. the annual rates of condemnation of these producers were 8.1%, 10.0% and 13.6% (fiscal year 2011), and 23.1%, 30.5% and 32.9% (fiscal year 2012). one producer with high annual condemnation rates was represented in the top 3 in both fiscal years. sporadic cases of swine mycobacteriosis were detected in 870 of 1,200 piggeries between 1988 and 1990. a time series analysis in this study demonstrated the feasibility of its practical application in the real-time detection. the detection of the outbreaks is important because of the public health impact to consumers and economic impact to producers of the disease. sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of mycobacteriosis in swine intestines are not taken into account. the meat inspection for mycobacteriosis in swine intestines is based on visual examination. unless molecular technology is used, classical tests would miss some infections. the level of detection is low enough to detect outbreak even in small-scale farms. large-scale farms have multiple production units, and outbreaks can occur within a unit. the present model can detect such outbreaks at a sale to slaughterhouse. this time-series model has been developed into user-friendly system on EXCEL fed by R-programing model. this method can be applied to other zoonotic food-borne diseases."}
