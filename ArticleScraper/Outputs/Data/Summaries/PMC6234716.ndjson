{"summary": "influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; family Pneumoviridae) are both single-strand RNA viruses and cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults [1], [2], [3], [4]. both community and nosocomial acquisition of influenza and RSV are possible in this patient group. the pediatric ward contains 5 single (one-bed) and 5 two-bed rooms. the adult ward has 4 single (one-bed) rooms, 6 two-bed rooms, and 3 four-bed rooms. parents are allowed to stay overnight with their children on the pediatric ward. piratory material was obtained from all patients lacking respiratory symptoms. patients received a full diagnostic virology panel including influenza virus and RSV. repeated audits and feedback talks took place to guarantee high adherence to the screening program. infection control interventions for asymptomatic patients with RSV and influenza virus were the same as for symptomatic patients. each positive PCR test was electronically communicated to infection control staff. patients were restricted to their single (one-bed) room and were trained in hand hygiene. parents are allowed to stay overnight with their children on the pediatric ward. a regular change of clothing is recommended. the PCR-based screening for influenza started in the second half of December 2016. cDNA synthesis, amplification and detection of nucleic acid were performed in an Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) using a commercially available one-step real-time RT-PCR kit (RSV/hMPV r-gene\u00ae PCR Kit, bioM\u00e9rieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany) the influenza RT-PCR differentiates between types A and B. 66 (26%) of these patients were aged 18 or younger and were screened on the pediatric ward. of the remaining 185 adult patients, 11 (5.9%) received swabs on the emergency ward. 174 patients were screened exclusively on the adult hemato-oncological ward. two- and four-bed rooms at the time the screening test was reported positive (4 positive for RSV, 9 positive for influenza virus) 6 of these patients in shared rooms were immediately moved to separate single rooms, following the infection control recommendations. 10 of the 23 asymptomatic patients were already located in single (one-bed) rooms. the screening was intended to detect patients that shed the virus without having signs or symptoms of disease. of the 23 asymptomatic shedders, we detected an increased viral load in 6 patients in follow-up specimens. this group of patients is of particular interest for infection control strategies. 13 out of 23 asymptomatic patients tested positive for RSV or influenza virus in our study occupied shared patient rooms at the time of virus detection. the majority were moved to single rooms (one-bed rooms) or cohorting was used. droplet and contact precautions were used for all affected patients. the clinical course and outcome of the patients identified by screening was not accessible for this study. however, this approach has been established for respiratory specimens by previous studies on influenza and other pathogens. funding This research did not receive specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. authors\u2019 contributions All authors contributed to the manuscript according to the ICMJE recommendations: AH and CB were responsible for data acquisition.
