{"summary": "chickens harbor locus ev21 express infectious endogenous viruses. exogenous ALVs can be classified into five subgroups including ALV-A, -B, -C, -D, and -J. ev21 loci can induce immunological tolerance to exogenous ALV. in recent years, two novel ALV recombined by ALV-C, ALV-E, and ALV-J were identified in different lines of layer chicken in china. a novel cross-species recombinant retrovirus has been also reported. it remains unclear whether the presence of ev21 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chickens has any effect on the host. blood samples were collected aseptically with anticoagulant and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C at 1200 rpm for 15 min to isolate plasma. plasma samples were stored at 80\u00b0C. all animal procedures were performed according to the regulations and guidelines established by the South China Agriculture University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the supernatant collected was tested for ALV group-specific antigen (p27) via an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the results were expressed as s/p ratios where s/p = (Sample Mean Kit Negative Control Mean) DNA was extracted from ELISA-positive samples selected from late- and fast- feathering chicken groups. Cloning and sequencing of the ev21 element and ALV-J genomes were amplified with specific primers designed based on the published corresponding sequences. PCR amplification was performed using a blood DNA template from three late- feathering chickens. PCR products were excised from 1% agarose-TAE gels and purified using a DNA gel extraction kit. three independent clones of each pMD18-T vector were sequenced by the Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) Sequence analysis Sequence alignments were compared between ev21 and ALV-J isolated from late-feathering chickens. the pmyc-M180env plasmid was constructed by inserting the env gene of the M180 strain into pCMV-myc vector. DF-1 cells were co-transfected with pflg-ev21env and pmyc-M180env, pflg-ev21env and pCMV-myc EV plasmids using mouse anti-Flag Mab (Sigma, USA) the supernatant was collected and analyzed via western blotting. the supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 14,000 g for 1 min. the residue was resuspended with 2 loading buffer and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. the control was co-transfected with pflg-EV, pGL3-LTR, and pRL-TK plasmid. data were representative of the results of three independent experiments. qPCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System. data analyses were performed using iTaqTM Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix Kit reagents. previously published primers were used to screen chickens for the integration of chicken endogenous retrovirus ev21 (Tixier-Boichard et al., 1994) previously published primers were used to screen chickens for the integration of chicken endogenous retrovirus ev21. DNA was extracted (Omega, USA) from ELISA-positive samples selected from late- and fast- feathering chicken groups. these samples were tested via PCR with previously published primers for different subgroups of exogenous ALVs. IFA was performed using the FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG. ev21env Forward aaatgtagtcaatagagccag X54094.1 Reverse gcctctctctcctccttcg ev21LTR. PCR products were excised from 1% agarose-TAE gels. purified PCR products were cloned into the TA vector pMD18-T (Takara, Japan). pflg-ev21env plasmid was constructed by cloning the cDNA of ev21 from late-feathering yellow chicken into the pCMV-myc vector. pCMV-flg and pCMV-myc were used as the empty vector (EV) controls. in one group, DF-1 cells were co-transfected with pflg-ev21env and pmyc-M180env, pflg-ev21env and pCMV-myc EV plasmids using mouse anti-MYC Mab (Sigma, USA) in the other group, DF-1 cells were co-transfected with pflg-ev21env and pmyc-M180env, pmyc-M the residue was resuspended with 2 loading buffer and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. the supernatant was collected and analyzed via western blotting using mouse anti-Flag MAb (Sigma, USA) and the JE9 monoclonal antibody. DF-1 cells were transfected with pflg-ev21env and pflg-EV plasmid. total RNA was extracted from infected cells at 6h and 24 h post infection. qPCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-time PCR. data analyses were performed using the 2Ct method. the replication of the M180 strain was evaluated with the JE9 monoclonal antibody at 6 and 24 hpi. fast-feathering chickens produced two amplification bands at about 515 and 390 bp. all samples were detected in this study and the results complied with the above figure. ELISA results indicated that 10 of 46 plasma samples were positive (21.7%) in fast-feathering chicken flock. DF-1 cells infected with ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 were detected by IFA and western blot analysis. DF-1 cells infected with M180 and K243 produced specific ALV-J envelope protein blots. the sequence of ev21 amplified in this study was the same as the published sequence (X54094.1). compared with the env gene and LTR of ev21 and the corresponding sequence of M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively. the results showed that there was no evidence of recombination between M180 and ev21. 97.2% (2622 bp) 98.9% (2622 bp) 99.8% (874 aa) D D env (1689 bp; 563 aa) 94.7% (1692 bp) 92.5% (564 aa) 94.2% (1692 bp) 91.8% (307 aa) 97.4% (1698 bp) 95.7% (566 aa) 94.8% (1301 ev21 envelop protein band produced when co-transfected with pflg-ev21env and pCMV-myc EV plasmids in DF-1 cells. this result confirmed that pflg-ev21env and pmyc-M180env function in this system. pCMV-myc empty vector control have no protein expression. ev21 envelope protein band was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE.
