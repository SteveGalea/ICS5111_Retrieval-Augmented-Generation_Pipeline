{"summary": "hantaviruses have a tripartite genome comprising the L segment encoding the RNA-polymerase, the M segment encoding two external glycoproteins, and the S segment encoding the nucleocapsid protein [12]. hantaviruses are maintained in nature in persistently infected rodents, each hantavirus type being predominantly associated with. hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. other hantaviruses are apathogenic. this may result in hantavirus genome reassortment or recombination. the presence of V-type and REC-type S RNA was monitored on ten sequential passages of the mixture of TULV02 and RecTULV5 variants. the V-type S RNA was detected during all ten passages while the REC-type completely disappeared after the 5th passage. the purified and pre-passaged recombinant virus presented no real match to the original cell adapted variant, TUL02. lines 1\u20133: products of RT-PCR with primers VF738 and VR855 on RNA from cells infected with TULV02. lines 5\u20137: the corresponding products of RT-PCR with primers RECF738 and RECR855 (specific for the wt virus) on RNA from infected cells collected on passages 1 to 10. wt recombinant strains of TULV are represented almost exclusively by the variant. the proportion of the dominant variant is larger in the passaged recTULV. if this resulted from higher frequency of recombination through the \"hot-spot\" hairpin-like structures predicted for the recombination \"hot-spot\" in the plus- and minus- sense S RNA of TULV. the recTULV presents no real match to the original cell adapted variant. the lower fitness of the recombinant virus can not be increased by pre-passaging. ers 5 103 \u2013 104 FFU/ml were infected with the 1:1 mixture of recTULV and TULV02. after 7\u201312 days the supernatant (20 ml) was collected and RNA was extracted from the cells with TriPureTM isolation reagent, Boehringer Mannheim. TULV RecTULV (clone 5) was purified from the mixture it formed with the original variant, TULV02, using two consequent passages under terminal dilutions. after the purification, recTULV underwent three more passages, performed under standard conditions, i.e. without dilution. the presence of recS-RNA on the passages was monitored by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed with primers RECF738 and RECR855. all four primers were perfect matches to the homologous sequences. the forward primers have five mismatches while the reverse primers have six."}
