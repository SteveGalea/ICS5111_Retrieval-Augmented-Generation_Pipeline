{"summary": "coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 circulate in humans and cause mild respiratory diseases. the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012 showed that coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and emerge as highly pathogenic viruses. the high fatality rate and wide spread of these new emerging coronaviruses indicate that they are a the fusion subunit undergoes large-scale conformational rearrangements to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide. the cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is located after residue 667 of the precursor protein. the S2\u2019 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is highly conserved among coronaviruses. a recently reported cryo-EM structure of the MHV S glycoprotein in its postfusion state shows an elongated cone-shaped structure that is significantly different from the prefusion structure. the prefusion SARS-CoV S1 subunit is structurally organized into four distinct domains: NTD, CTD1, CTD2 and CTD3 [13]. similar observations of a protruding \u201cup\u201d CTD1 have also been reported for MERS-CoV S glycoproteins [7, cryo-EM analysis of the cleaved S glycoprotein showed an intact trimer in both the neutral-pH (pH 7.2) and the low-pH (pH 5.6) buffer. the maps are consistent with the prefusion S trimer structure previously determined using the Arg667Ala mutant. the complex was then prepared using trypsin-cleaved and low-pH-treated S glycoprotein and ACE2. three conformational states of the complex were captured and determined at resolutions of 5.4, 4.2 and 4.5. ACE2-bound states showed that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein binds one ACE2 receptor utilizing only the \u201cup\u201d CTD1. the structure of the other ACE2-free state was determined at a resolution of 3.9. this conformation was designated as the unbound-up conformation, which is ready for receptor binding. the structure of the other ACE2-free state was determined at a resolution of 3.6. ACE2-free spikes Simultaneous observation of the ACE2-bound, unbound-up and unbound-down conformations of the S glycoprotein in the trypsin- and low-pH-treated sample provided an opportunity to investigate possible conformational changes induced by receptor binding. a hinge motion away from the spike axis compared to CTD2 in the unbound-down conformation. Upon binding to the receptor ACE2, CTD2 exhibits a hinge motion away from the S2 stem. the fusion peptide is colored red and position of the S2\u2019 site is indicated with black arrows. the \u201cC\u201d shape loop covering the S2\u2019 site is colored blue. the cleavage site is inaccessible in both the unbound-down and the ACE2-bound SARS-CoV S glycoprotein structures. the uninterpreted density at one distal end of the dumbbell-shaped density map should be the exposed fusion peptide that is disordered. the cleavage site is not resolved and should be completely exposed based on the post-fusion SARS-CoV S2 structure model (S9C Fig). analysis of the S trimer structure in the prefusion state showed that the \u201cC\u201d-shaped loop (residues 787\u2013796) covering the S2\u2019 cleavage site was clipped by the linker downstream of the S1/S2 cleavage site of an adjacent protomer. disassociation of one S1-ACE2 complex from the spike would release the clipping linker. ACE2 and S1 densities are marked cyan and pink respectively. a 3D density map calculated from the particles of the S1-ACE2 peak in \u201cA\u201d. ACE2 and S1 densities are marked cyan and pink respectively. elution peaks were collected by gel-filtration chromatography. fractions containing the complex were subjected to EM analysis. cleaved S glycoprotein showed intact trimer in neutral-pH and low-pH buffer. three conformational states of the S-ACE2 complex were captured and determined at resolutions of 5.4, 4.2 and 4.5. two conformational states of the ACE2-free S glycoprotein were also determined at resolutions of 3.6 and 3.9. ACE2-bound states showed that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein binds one ACE2 receptor utilizing only the \u201cup\u201d CTD1. Cryo-EM analysis showed similar ACE2-bound, unbound-up and unbound-down conformations. ACE2 and the trypsin-cleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein were tested without low-pH treatment. the angle for the CTD1s from the ACE2-bound conformations was approximately 22.7\u00b0. Approximately 19% of the ACE2-bound particles had their CTD1s open to 111.6\u00b0. this result indicates that receptor binding can open up CTD1. further comparisons were performed for CTD2, which is located underneath CTD1. binding to one ACE2 did not induce significant conformational changes in the stem region of the prefusion S glycoprotein. binding to one ACE2 did not induce significant conformational changes in the stem region of the prefusion S glycoprotein. the cleavage site is inaccessible in both the unbound-down and the ACE2-bound SARS-CoV S glycoprotein structures. neither the \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d conformational change of one CTD1 and its binding to one ACE receptor nor a decrease in the pH drive exposure of the S2\u2019 cleavage site. scale bar: 50 nm. (C) 2D class averaged cryo-EM images of the SARS-CoV S2 in post-fusion state. the three protomers are colored pink, yellow and cyan, respectively. a similar size-exclusion chromatography profile and rosette-shaped particles in the EM image of the complex consisting of ACE2 and the trypsin-cleaved S glycoprotein without low-pH treatment. this finding indicates that low-pH treatment of the cleaved S glycoprotein is not required for the disassociation of S1-ACE2 or for the formation of rosette-shaped particles. ACE2 and S1 densities are marked cyan and pink, respectively. the flexible NTD and CTD3 are not visible and are represented as an ellipse. the linker downstream the S1/S2 cleavage site is colored green. cleavage at the S1/S2 site is required for a functional S glycoprotein. similar results were obtained for the cleaved with/without low-pH treatment S glycoproteins. the conformational heterogeneity of CTD1s still exists. a conformational switch producing more than one \u201cup\u201d CTD1 may destabilize the cleaved S glycoprotein and trigger immediate disassociation of the S1 subunits and the S1-ACE2 complex. the prefusion S2 subunits are a six-helix bundle with a 160-long central helix core. the \u201cdown\u201d CTD1s are located immediately above the S2 subunits. the direct contact should stabilize the prefusion S2 subunit and prevent it from transitioning into the postfusion state. opening of CTD1, especially by binding the receptor, would remove the steric restraints on helix linker 2, triggering the release of the S1 subunits. binding to ACE2 opens up CTD1 and CTD2 promotes disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from the S1/S2 cleaved S glycoprotein. binding to ACE2 opens up CTD1 and CTD2 and initiates membrane fusion. the cell culture was collected by centrifugation at 48 hours post infection. the supernatant was concentrated, loaded into nickel
