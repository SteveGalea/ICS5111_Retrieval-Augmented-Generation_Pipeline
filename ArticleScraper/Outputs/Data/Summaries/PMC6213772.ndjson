{"summary": "influenza viruses are enveloped viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. they are able to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, including humans. influenza B viruses (IBV) are mainly restricted and adapted to humans. sporadic infections of seals have been documented. there are 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11) IAV subtypes. but only IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are circulating in humans. influenza pandemic of the 21st century was declared in 2009. the viral proteins in the virion particle and in the vRNP are indicated. the viral proteins showed in the illustration of the viral particle do not maintain the stoichiometric found in a mature virion. each viral segment contains non-coding regions (nCR) at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends (black lines) IBV infections cause annual outbreaks of respiratory illness and are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population [26,27]. Typically, IBV epidemics are less severe than H3N2 IAV but more severe than H1N1 IAV in adults and the elderly population [28,29,30]. there are two major evolutionary mechanisms responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza. current available options to counter influenza infections include both vaccines and antivirals. the first option is the chemically inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which requires a large quantity of virus to induce NAbs sufficient for protection against subsequent infections. the remaining prophylactic option is the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) influenza vaccines have shown a low protection efficacy rate over the past decade. from 2013 through 2016, the efficacy of the quadrivalent LAIV in the us has been shown to be even lower than its predecessor, the trivalent formulation [46,47], leading the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make the recommendation that the quadrivalent LAIV should not be used during 2016\u201317 or 2017\u201318 in the US. IAV genome encodes up to 16 different viral proteins using multiple strategies such as overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), alteRNAtive splicing and frameshift mechanisms. each of the vRNA segments are flanked by non-coding regions (NCRs) that serve as polymerase promoters for viral genome replication and gene transcription. the polymerase complex is a heterotrimeric structure of approximately 270 kilodaltons (kDa) it contains three protein subunits: the polymerase basic 2 and 1 (PB2 and PB1, respectively) and acidic (PA) proteins that allow each vRNP to act as an independent transcription-replication element in infected cells. the viral HA, NA, and M2 are structural proteins located in the virion membrane (Figure 1A) lipid envelope derived from the infected host plasma membrane. release of newly synthesized virions requires removing SA from glycans on the cellular surface. progeny viruses are then able to start a new replication cycle by infecting new target cells. the viral polymerase complex core of IAV is formed by the PB1 polymerase subunit together with the C-terminal domain of PA and the N-terminal 35 residues of PB2. in a second phase, the influenza viral polymerase complex catalyzes the transcription of vRNA into mRNA using primers generated by the PA subunit from host capped RNAs. IAV PB1 has the characteristic right hand fold, containing fingers, palm, and thumb domains that include the classic pre-A (or F) and A-E polymerase motifs. however, IAV PB1 needs the cap-binding action of PB2 and the endonuclease activity of PA to carry out viral mRNA synthesis. IAV PB1 is a promising target for the generation and identification of novel antivirals to treat influenza infections. a dynamic version of this figure where molecules can be rotated in real time is available online as Figure S1. panel A shows the PB1 RdRp subunit in grey with its thumb domain colored blue. IAV PB1 (A), PB2 (B), PA (C), and NP (D) are indicated in red, magenta, or blue. PB2 polymerase subunit is the production of 5\u2032-capped RNA molecules from cellular pre-mRNAs. PB2 contains multiple functional domains necessary to perform viral RNA synthesis. aromatic residues (F404 and H357) are involved in the binding to the cap structure for the cap snatching process in which a cellular mRNA is cleaved a few nucleotides after the 5\u2032 cap. the PB2 subunit is an important determinant of virulence and a host range restriction of IAV. it has been reported that the PB2 subunit is an important determinant of virulence. nascent host capped RNAs and then the viral PA cleaves the capped RNA using its endonuclease activity. RNA synthesis is then completed by the RdRp activity of the IAV PB1 subunit. the endonuclease catalytic site is similar to other type II endonucleases. NP contains an RNA-binding region at its N-terminus region (Figure 3D) and two domains responsible for NP-NP self-interaction, at the center and C-terminal region (Figure 3D) phosphorylation of NP could also play a role in its oligomerization [112] IAV PB1 needs the cap-binding action of PB2 and the endonuclease activity of PA to carry out viral mRNA synthesis. the whole transcriptase complex is significantly larger than the core RdRp that is often contained within a single protein in other RNA viruses. PB1 contains a NLS, although PB1 depends on an interaction with IAV PA for its nuclear import. panel D shows the to-scale structure of the poliovirus polymerase elongation complex. PB1 contains multiple functional domains necessary to perform viral RNA synthesis. PB2 contains the PB1 interacting region. two-thirds of IAV PB2 contains the cap-binding domain (CBD) and the \u201c627-domain\u201d [94,95] Upon infection, PB2 is located mainly in the nucleus. other amino acid residues located in other viral genes have also been described to be important for virus host adaptation. PB2 is also able to bind NP and the amino acids involved in this interaction are located in the middle and C-terminal region of IAV PB2. IAV polymerase does not have capping activity and relies on cellular capped RNAs as cap-donors. this process is known as cap-snatching. NP IAV NP is a multifunctional basic protein essential for the replication of the viral genome and its transcription. NP is required for the processivity of the polymerase on long RNA templates. NP contains an RNA-binding region at its N-terminus region and two domains responsible for NP-NP self-interaction. several viral LAV are associated with a ts phenotype. it is likely that ts mutations attenuate viruses by diminishing viral replication or pathogenesis at a specific body temperature. the use of ts attenuated viruses is considered effective LAV and one of the best prophylactic measure to prevent disease caused by viral infections. viral replication is restricted at higher temperatures, which are found in the human lower respiratory tract or during febrile process (>35 \u00b0C), resulting in an attenuated (att) phenotype. this allows the host to mount an effective immune response to the infection in the upper airway and nasal cavity, without risking pathogenesis from a lower airway infection. both the WHO candidate IAV and the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV MDV are inoculated in eggs followed by the selection of appropriate seed viruses. the resulting virus containing the HA (red) and NA (blue) segments from the WHO-recommended IAV strain and the six inteRNAl vRNAs of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV is amplified and used for vaccine production and used as a seasonal LAIV att IAVs derived from the same virus strain (A/Leningrad/134/57 H2N2) were generated and have been used for the preparation of seasonal LAIV. a/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Len/17) H2N2 MDV was obtained after 20 sequential passages at 32 \u00b0C. the locations of various IAV mutations found in the MDV LAIV and in revertant strains are shown as CPK spheres on the background of the polymerase complex colored as in Figure 2. a dynamic version of this figure where molecules can be rotated in real time is available on-lines as Figure S2.

PB1 (E51K and I171V; found in P10 and P15, respectively), PA (N350K; found in P5), and NP (N125Y and/or V186I; found at P5 and P20, respectively) were enough to revert the ts phenotype of the US MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2. revertant virus was generated after 18 passages at elevated temperatures in embryonated chicken eggs. the virus lost the ts and ca phenotype, since the virus was able to grow with high titers at 40 \u00b0C. revertant virus replicated at similar levels than the WT A/Leningrad/134/57 virus in mouse lungs. the location of amino acid variations in the revertant or original ts viruses can be analyzed. in PB1, the original ts, ca, and att amino acid change A661T localize in a region where PB1 and PB2 interact. in PB1, the original ts, ca, and att amino acid change A661T localize in a region where PB1 and PB2 interact and in the PB1:RNA interface. the PB2 N265S amino acid substitution in the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 appears to be part of electrostatic interactions between two PB2 domains. however, many details regarding the location and potential functions of amino acids involved in ts, ca, and att phenotypes remain elusive because the lack of high-resolution structures depicting interactions between the polymerase subunits. merase structure will have significant implications to understand mechanisms involved in ts and att phenotypes. some of the PA linker mutants exhibited a ts phenotype. some of the ts viruses (D216P and L219P) were attenuated in a mouse model. the isolation of revertant mutants in ts viruses allowed the identification of compensatory changes located in one of the three-polymerase subunits. these data demonstrate the importance of studying the IAV polymerase complex to understand the mechanism behind the ts and ca phenotypes. authors isolated a ts, att C4/W1 virus that provided efficient protection in chickens against H5N1 HPAIV challenge. they identified a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit (F35S) that was associated with the ts phenotype. findings demonstrate potential use of new identified ts and att viruses as well as their respective mutations in the development and implementation of new LAIV. noton et al. described the characterization of an avian influenza virus (A/chicken/Rostock/34 H7N1) ts NP mutant (M239L) this mutant virus was generated by chemical mutagenesis in the 1970s. however, the ts mutant PR8 NP M239L virus released about six-fold more virus particles than the WT PR8. X-31 H3N2 IAV [147] analyzed the genetic signature of the virus. characterized the contribution of the identified amino acid changes in the ts, ca phenotype of the ts and ca phenotype of the virus. mice did not show clinical signs even at high titer infection with the mutant. the six inteRNAl genes from most to least to the ca phenotype were NP > PB1 = M > PA > PB2 = NS and that to the ts phenotype were NP > PB2 = NS and that to the ts phenotype were NP > PB2 = NS. authors did not identify specific amino acid residues in each of the viral proteins involved in the ca, ts, and att phenotype. amino acid substitutions in the backbone of A/WSN/33 to understand the role of the zinc finger motif and the RKLKR domain of M1 were involved in RNA binding, during viral assembly and replication. a reduction for both the nuclear export of vRNP and viral replication was observed [153]. some mutations in the NS1 protein can confer a ts phenotype to IAV by different mechanisms. a recombinant PR8 virus containing the mutations responsible for the ts, ca, and att phenotype of the MDV. PR8 LAIV-11C showed higher attenuation in vivo than PR8 LAIV. but was able to stimulate similar humoral responses and protect against a lethal challenge with the WT PR8 virus. this could be attributed to the NS1 11C mutations affecting virus egress/budding. laIV are administered by the intranasal route, mimicking a natural infection. IIV are administered intramuscularly, leading to suboptimal induction of immune responses in the mucosa. emergence of viral strain variants, distinct from selected vaccine strain, can result in significant loss of vaccine effectiveness. in this review, we have discussed the use of ts, ca, and att mutations in IAV for the generation of LAIV. this approach could provide a deliberate method of viral attenuation. combined polymerase thermosensitivity with other approaches can assure a higher attenuated profile for the development of safer LAIV."}{"summary": "influenza viruses are enveloped viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. they are able to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, including humans. influenza B viruses (IBV) are mainly restricted and adapted to humans. sporadic infections of seals have been documented. there are 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11) IAV subtypes. but only IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are circulating in humans. influenza pandemic of the 21st century was declared in 2009. the viral proteins in the virion particle and in the vRNP are indicated. the viral proteins showed in the illustration of the viral particle do not maintain the stoichiometric found in a mature virion. each viral segment contains non-coding regions (nCR) at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends (black lines) IBV infections cause annual outbreaks of respiratory illness and are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population [26,27].
