{"summary": "a single case-control study reported the presence of hematological abnormalities in humans infected with gorilla simian foamy viruses (SFVs) it has been hypothesized that FVs are not able to cause disease in healthy, naturally-infected individuals due to functional immune systems that control virus infection. rhesus macaques naturally infected with SFV and experimentally infected with simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SIV) progress more frequently to simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) compared to SIV-monoinfected macaques. domestic cats (Felis catus) can be persistently infected with feline spumaretrovirus. the main transmission route of FeLV is oropharyngeal exposure to mucosal secretions containing the virus [30]. viremic cats are considered to have a progressive infection, with high proviral and plasma RNA VLs [32]. a pre-existent FeLV infection enhanced the expression of FIV in the body and increased the severity of transient primary and chronic secondary stages of FIV infection. only a single study has evaluated the presence of all three retroviruses in cats [17], but was limited only to prevalence estimates. cats from clinics were selected randomly, independently whether they looked sick or not. the chances they have been vaccinated are minimal, since public policies do not include FeLV vaccination. for feral cats without a known birthdate, age was estimated by veterinarian evaluation. household status was classified as: single, cats living alone at home; multicat, cats living with up to 10 cats in the same house; and feral, cats that have lived in the streets before. serological Screening of FIV and FeLV plasma from domestic cats was tested for FIV/FeLV by two commercial immunochromatographic tests. these tests simultaneously detect an FeLV antigen and an FIV antibody. sensitivity of 100% and 96.7% for FeLV and 96% and 97.6% for FIV were established. v sequences (1689-bp) were published previously ([46]), respectively. v sequences were used for PCR amplification of feline retrovirus (FFV, FIV and FeLV) genome sequences. PCR conditions using newly designed primers were performed using 10 PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl2, 25 mM dNTPs, 25 pmol forward and reverse primers. the last four bases were removed from the original primer sequence. generic pol primers and probe were designed using an alignment of complete FFV genomes at GenBank. the forward and reverse primers FFVPFP1 5\u2032-CAT GTT GTC AGC ACC AAG TAT AC-3\u2032 and probe FFVPFP1 5\u2032-FAM-TTG GAA TCT TCT TC-3\u2032 were used to detect a 120-bp pol sequence. the potential LOD was determined using 10 replicates of the 10-fold dilutions. we tested 60 ten copy replicates, 90 five copy replicates and 140 single copy replicates. the number of provirus copies/cell was estimated using the formula: number of copies detected / ( DNA quantification in picograms / 6 pgs cell. plasmid containing target region in serial dilution range of 103\u2013109 copies. pVL was divided by two to compensate for presence of two LTR copies per integrated provirus. FFV-positive cats with virus detected in oral swabs considered as latent infections. a multivariate analysis was conducted by adjusting the model for variables that showed significant associations with FFV/FeLV co-infection. all statistics were performed using MedCalc v.11.3.0.0 or in the R environment and p-values 0.05 were considered significant. swabs were collected from 68 cats by rubbing the upper, bottom and side of the oral cavity with a sterile cotton swab. twenty-eight cats were followed three years after the initial collection to determine their life status (alive or dead) for FeLV-infected cats, the time elapsed from infection was estimated using the sampling date. blood samples were centrifuged at 568 g for 10 min to separate plasma from cells. plasma aliquots were stored at 80 \u00b0C for FIV/FeLV serologic testing. gDNA from PBMC and buccal swabs was extracted using a nanodrop. three new PCR primers were designed using an alignment of the four available complete FFV genomes from domestic cats. primers used for detection of the FIV reverse transcriptase (RT) portion (603-bp) of the pol gene and of FeLV env sequences (1689-bp) were published previously ([46]). forward CCTCGGGTCCAAACACAGCC Designed herein polymerase FFV_R1 1st reverse CCAAGGTCCTCTCCAGG Designed herein (gag/pol) FUV2610s 2nd forward AACAGCAACACTCTGATGTTCCCG [44] integrase (int) SIF5N_mod a 1st forward TACATGGTTATACCCCACKAAGGCTC [10] SIR1NN PCR conditions using newly designed primers were performed using 10 PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl2, 25 mM dNTPs, 25 pmol forward and reverse primers. a new quantitative PCR assay was developed to simultaneously detect and measure FFV proviral loads in infected cats. 20 human blood donor PBMC DNAs and five different human cell lines were used as negative controls. specificity and sensitivity were also determined using PBMC lysates from 39 US domestic cats previously found to be FFV-negative (n = 18) or positive (n = 21) by Western blot analysis. the amount of DNA in nanograms was measured by spectrophotometry. the assay was 100% by obtaining negative results for PBMC DNA from 80 pathogen-free, FeLV-negative cats. assay sensitivity was 100% by confirmation of infection in 30 FeLV p27-positive cats. FFV-positive cats with virus detected in oral swabs considered as latent infections. cats testing qPCR positive for FeLV were classified into two groups based on VL and serostatus. a multivariate analysis was conducted by adjusting the model for variables that showed significant associations with FFV/FeLV co-infection. cats were classified according to gender, age, outdoor access, sexual sterilization, household type, and health status. twenty of 36 male cats (56%) were neutered, while 15 of 30 females (50%) were spayed. most cats (55%) were classified as feral and of the 35 cats residing in any household (21 multicats, 12 shelters and 2 singles), the majority (69%) had no outdoor access. most cats (66%) were also sick at the time of sample collection. total number includes 35 household cats, 43 feral cats and three cats with no information. the total number includes 35 household cats, 43 feral cats and three cats with no information. FFV PCR prevalence of 46% (37/81). of the 37 FFV-positive animals, 33 had both PBMC and buccal swab gDNA specimens available for nested FFV PCR testing. twenty-nine animals were PCR-positive (88%) in the PBMC compartment. a limited number of samples were tested due to material availability. we developed a new quantitative real-time qPCR (qPCR) assay to simultaneously detect and measure FFV proviral load (pVL) in cats. PBMC gDNA was further available from 34 of 37 cats testing positive using the nested PCR assays. of these 34 cats, 26 were qPCR-positive with a median pVL of 1.74 log10 copies/cell (18,546 copies/106 cells) of 31 cats with available buccal swab gDNA, 12 were positive with a median pVL of 0.67 log10 copies/cell (303,671 copies/106 cells) n = 4) (p = 1). distribution of feline foamy virus (FFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) log10 proviral loads (pVLs) in blood and oral specimens. PCR-positive and -negative cat samples in peripheral blood mononuclear cell or buccal specimens are presented on the x-axis. group I (n = 19) had a higher pVL with an average of 2.23 log10 FeLV copies/cell (2.25 108 copies/106 cells) and median pVL of 2.20 FeLV log10 copies/cell (1.59 108 copies/106 cells) in group I, 16% (n = 3) were FeLV-seronegatives while in group II, 28% (n = 2) had that status (p = 0.588). the total number of FeLV-positive cats increased from 27 (33%) to 48 (59%) of the 48 qPCR-positive cats, eight (17%) were monoinfected with FeLV, while 38 (79%) were co-infected with both FFV and FeLV. the majority of cats living in multi-cat homes or shelters were FFV/FeLV-co-infected (52% and 75%, respectively) the majority of cats with outdoor access were also co-infected with FFV and FeLV. no associations of co-infection were found with either age or sex. we also evaluated risk factors for FFV co-infection in domestic cats. a multivariate analysis was performed with adjustment for those two variables. street cats remained significantly less prone for co-infection with FFV and FeLV than non-street cats. differences in PBMC pVLs between buccal swabs and PBMCs were not significant. Ellipses in (B) represent different groups of FeLV infection outcome (regressive or progressive) we also evaluated pVLs of cat samples that were tested for both FFV and FeLV, but did not observe a correlation between FeLV and FFV pVLs in PBMCs among cats with progressive or regressive infection. b samples of progressive and regressive cats were inversely correlated. the percentage of potentially transmissible FFV with detectable pVLs in buccal swabs was very similar to that in FeLV progressive cats (72.7%) the opposite was found when comparing FFV-monoinfected cats and FeLV regressives (p = 0.004) five of seven (71%) cats with FFV/FeLV-progressive infection were anemic at the time of data collection by hemogram testing. none of the FFV/FeLV-regressive cats were anemic (0/2; p = 0.026) the low frequency of these clinical signs did not permit an analysis of their association with retrovirus infection of these cats. we analyzed FFV pVLs in cats with or without each reported major clinical signs. but did not observe differences between pVLs in cats with or without PWL. death was also correlated with higher PBMC pVL. three were feral (25%) and nine were captive (75%), 11 were adults (92%) and one was young (8%) whereas the 13th cat was lost to follow-up at 24 months. there was no difference in age or household status in both groups. eLV co-infected (%) Total 81 (100) 26 (32) 8 (10) 38 (47) Gender (n =81) Female 40 (49) 11 (28) 3 (8) 22 (55) Male 41 (51) 15 (37) 5 (12) 16 (39) Age group (n = 79) Kitten 18 (23) 8 (44) 0 (0) 7 (38) Young 16 (20) 5 (31) 0 (0) 1 (50) Multi-cat 21 (27) 2 (10) 3 (14) 11 (52) Shelter 12 35 cats residing in any household (21 multicats, 12 shelters and 2 singles) the majority (69%) had no outdoor access. the majority (66%) were also sick at the time of sample collection. the total number includes 35 household cats, 43 feral cats and three cats with no information. the total number includes 35 household cats, 43 feral cats and three cats with no information. 15 animals were positive in both PBMC and buccal swab. 14 cats were positive only in PBMC and four were positive only in buccal swab. no significant differences were found when comparing feral to household cats. FFV int sequences were not detected in PBMC gDNA from 20 US human blood donors or in five different human cell lines. sensitivity of the qPCR assay was also evaluated using PBMC lysates from 39 US domestic cats for which the infection status was previously determined. 44 cats tested negative by nested PCR, 39 had PBMC gDNA available for qPCR testing. of these 39 cats, 27 were qPCR-positive with a median pVL of 1.60 log10 copies/cell (24,900 copies/106 cells) there was no pVL differences between animals that were previously positive or negative for FFV using the nested assays. the total number of FFV-positive cats increased from 37 (46%) to 67 (83%) of these 67 qPCR-positive cats, 26 (38.8%) were monoinfected with FFV. analysis of cats classified as potentially transmissible and non-transmissible found no statistical difference between FFV pVLs. in group I, 16% (n = 3) were FeLV-seronegatives while in group II, 28% (n = 2) had that status (p = 0.588). pVLs of FeLV-seronegative cats were similar to those measured in the group II FeLV-positive cats (p = 0.193), indicating that the FeLV-seronegative cats with low pVLs likely had a regressive infection. total number of FeLV-positive cats increased from 27 (33%) to 48 (59%) of the 48 qPCR-positive cats, eight (17%) were monoinfected with FeLV. 38 (79%) were co-infected with both FFV and FeLV. two (4%) were infected with all three feline retroviruses. monoinfection of FFV was 11.4% (4/35) while in feral animals the prevalence was 49% (21/43) (p 0.001). however, the total prevalence of FFV (mono and dual-infection with FeLV) was 86% in feral (5%) compared to captive (14%) cats. the effect of neutering was lost (OR = 2.43;p = 0.161) street cats remained significantly less prone for co-infection with FFV and FeLV than non-street cats. differences in PBMC pVLs between mono- and co-infected cats were not significant (p = 0.378) however, pVLs in buccal specimens were significantly higher than those in PBMC of co-infected cats. correlations were tested in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (A) and buccal swab specimens (B) correlations were tested in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (a) and buccal swab specimens (B) the groups compared include monoinfected cats (FFV Mono), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) progressive (FeLV progressives) and regressive (FeLV regressives) cats in dual infection. in orange, the potentially FFV non-transmissible cats (undetectable buccal swab DNA) probabilities were calculated using the Chi-square test. the low frequency of these clinical signs did not permit an analysis of their association with retrovirus infection of these cats. however, the low frequency of these clinical signs did not permit an analysis of their association with retrovirus infection of these cats. anemia at the time of sampling was correlated with higher PBMC pVL. death was also correlated with higher PBMC pVL. 92.3% (12/13) of cats with progressive infection had died. cats with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) progressive and regressive infections were more likely to survive during this period compared to cats with progressive infection (p = 0.008). cats with regressive infections were more likely to survive during this period. about one fourth of FFV-infected cats were PCR-positive in only the PBMC compartment. this is supported by a previous report showing a delay in the appearance of SFV in the saliva of cynomolgus macaques. non-feral cats were almost five times more likely to be co-infected with FFV/FeLV than feral cats. non-feral cats were almost five times more likely to be co-infected with FFV/FeLV than feral cats. we hypothesize that being confined in a household or shelter environment increases the risk of co-infection. LV pVL is within the range reported by others for experimentally and naturally infected cats with progressive FeLV infection. the cause of death cannot be exclusively attributed to FeLV infection. other studies showed the same outcomes only for experimentally infected cats. FFV pVL was higher in buccal tissues of FFV/FeLV co-infected cats than among FFV monoinfections. the virome influences the phenotype of the host in a combinatorial manner. the virome influences the phenotype of the host by interacting with other components of the microbiome. we hypothesize that both viruses can infect the same compartment. the tax protein of HTLV-1 can activate HIV expression in vitro via the LTR [64] FeLV may enhance FFV replication in the oral cavity by a similar mechanism. domestic cats naturally infected by FFV and FeLV can be used as a model. the results of these animal model studies may help inform the design of clinical and research investigations into the potential for SFV to cause disease."}
