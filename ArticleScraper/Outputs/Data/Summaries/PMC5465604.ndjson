{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Avian coronavirus (AvCoV; Nidovirales:Coronaviridae:Coronavirinae:Gammacoronavirus) with an approximately 27-kb positive-sense, single-stranded, 5\u2032-capped genomic RNA. this genome is organized as 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)/open reading frame (ORF) 1ab (replicase polyprotein)/recept 57,827,656 and 132,767,024 paired-end sequences were obtained. resulting genomes for Ma5/BR-I were 27,652/27,618 nucleotides (nt) long, including the poly(A) tails, and organized as 5\u2032 UTR (nt 1 to 528/1 to 528) no recombination was found for the Ma5 and BR-I genomes using a set of AvCoV genomes in RDP4 (5). nucleotide identities between Ma5 and BR-I were 90.5% for the full genomes and 82.6% for the spike gene."}
