{"summary": "phenformin (phenylethyl biguanide) is a model for recruitment of endogenous Zn2+ to inhibit CysHis/CysHis peptidolysis. benzoyl-l-arginine amide is a classical substrate of papain-like proteases; the amide bond is scissile. Various substituent moieties can register with various substrate-binding sites so as to align coordinated Zn2+ with catalytic partners of diverse proteases."}
