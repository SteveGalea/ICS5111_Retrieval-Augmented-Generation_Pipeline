{"summary": "gene expression in all organisms is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription initiation, mRNA stability and turnover, translation and protein degradation. stable RNAs, such as ribosomal, transfer, nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs) are likely to undergo specific transformations in altered conditions. PCD in yeast is triggered by several different stimuli, including ageing, expression of mammalian pro-apoptotic proteins, exposure to low doses of H2O2, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and mating-type -factor pheromone. apoptosis inducing factor (Aif1) involved in chromatin condensation plays an important role in apoptotic chromatin condensation and cell death. yeast apoptosis has recently been shown to be activated in mRNA decay mutants (dcp and lsm) (22,23), supporting the notion that RNA metabolism and apoptosis are linked. in all eukaryotes it is thought to be correlated with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) strains lacking proteins which function in RNA metabolism were oversensitive to oxidative stress (1,2) these included genes encoding rRNA helicases (Dbp3, Dbp7), rRNA processing factors (Nop12, Nsr1), mRNA deadenylases (Ccr4, Pop2) and several mitochondrial RNA splicing components (2,27) this indicates that RNA processing and degradation may have a role in cellular response to ROS. yeast treatments Yeast cultures in early logarithmic phase (OD600 0.2) were stressed with H2O2 (0.12\u2013180 mM), menadione (0.12\u2013180 mM), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP, 0.1\u20130.2 mM), paraquat (0.1\u201310 mM), diamide (0.2\u20132 mM) and linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LoaOOH, 0.05\u2013 pre-treatment with ascorbic acid (20 mM, Fluka) and respiratory chain inhibitors oligomycin A (7.5 g/ml, Sigma) and sodium azide (1.5 mM, Sigma) was performed for 30 or 60 min prior to treatment with H2O2. cell fixation was achieved by addition of formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) or EtOH (final concentration 70%) to exponentially growing yeasts. high-molecular-weight RNAs were analysed on 1.2% agarose gels. oligonucletides used for RNA hybridization and primer extension (W235 and W237) are listed in Supplementary Table S2. ucleotide complementary to specific regions within rRNA at 68\u00b0C for 10 min and digested with 1.5 U RNase H at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. samples were separated on polyacrylamide gels and analysed by northern hybridization using probes located upstream of RHase H cleavage. cells were grown in SC media to early exponential stage, shifted to SC media, pH = 3 and treated with 175 mM acetic acid (Sigma) for 200 min. hyperosmotic shock was achieved by growth of exponential cells in SC complete media containing 60% (wt/wt) glucose (Fluka) or 30% (wt/wt) sorbitol and 2% glucose (Sigma) for 2\u20138 h. PFGE was conducted in a CHEF-DRIII Chiller System (Bio-Rad) one percent agarose gels were run in 0.5% Tris borate\u2013EDTA buffer at 14\u00b0C with an angle of 120\u00b0 with a voltage of 6 V/cm and switch times of 60\u201390 s for 24 h. RNA extraction and analysis RNA extraction, northern hybridization and primer extension were essentially as described (33,34). cDNA was amplified using primers W241 and W243. the resulting PCR product was gel purified, cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced using primer W241. samples of 10 g of total RNA were annealed with 40 ng of oligonucleotide complementary to the specific regions within rRNA at 68\u00b0C for 10 min. total RNA from wild-type W303 or BY4741 cells grown to early exponential phase (OD600 = 0.25) in YPD media was separated on 1.2% denaturing agarose/formaldehyde gels and analysed by northern hybridization using a probe complementary to the 5\u2032-end of mature 25S rRNA. this RNA species was chosen in the first place, since effects on 28S rRNA have been observed in apoptotic mammalian cells (8 each experiment was repeated at least 2\u20133 times. RNA from treatment with 0.6 mM H2O2 is shown in lane 5 for comparison. chromosomal DNA from cells treated with H2O2 (1 mM), menadione (0.5 mM), CHP (0.2 mM), paraquat (5 mM), diamid (2 mM) and t-BHP (1 mM) for 200 min was analysed using PFGE. chromosomal DNA from cells treated with H2O2 (1 mM), menadione (0.5 mM), paraquat (5 m rRNA degradation occurred only in H2O2-treated cells. this strongly indicates that rRNA decay phenotype can be related to apoptosis. for treatment with acetic acid, cells were grown in SC complete medium (pH 3) to exponential phase and exposed to 175 mM acetic acid for up to 200 min (29,30) rRNA degradation distinctly precedes the timing of DNA damage characterized in yeast exposed to the same stimuli (30) low doses of the oxidant, starting with 0.12 mM and optimal at 0.4\u20133 mM, were sufficient to initiate rRNA degradation with the appearance of specific bands. rho0 W303 cells treated with 1 mM H2O2 (A) and chronologically aged rho0 W303 cells (B) primer extensions were performed using primers W235 for sites around positions +400 and +470 and W237 for sites around position +600 relative to the 5\u2032 end of the mature 25S. sequences with primer extension stops were run in parallel on 6% sequencing polyacrylamide gels (lanes 1\u20134). 3\u2032 RACE analysis for fragments cleaved at site +398\u2013403 (19 independent clones) and site +610\u2013611 (10 independent clones) corresponding regions of the 25S with cleavage sites mapped by primer extension and indicated with empty arrowheads. rRNA are endonucleolytic and require cellular machinery Specific cleavages within the 25S rRNA generated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide were monitored by northern hybridization. this analysis showed the accumulation of diverse degradation products, some of which extended from the 5\u2032-end of the molecule. others were also truncated at their 5\u2032 ends (Figure 2A, lanes 25\u201330). 3\u2032-ends of the products generated by the H2O2-mediated cleavage in the 25S at positions +610\u2013611 and +398\u2013403 were determined by the 3\u2032 RACE. to this end, DNA \u2018anchor\u2019 oligonucleotide (W242) was ligated with T4 RNA ligase to total RNA from untreated and treated W303 cells to prepare cDNA using a primer specific for the anchor (W243) mutants rrp41-1 and ski7 were used to assess the status of the product 3\u2032 ends by a specific RNase H cleavage. this cleavage, directed by a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid between oligonucleotide W244 and a complementary region in the 25S starting at residue +271, allows higher resolution of analysed RNAs. in contrast, positions of cleavages at site +610\u2013611 are not affected by mutations in the rRNA degradation in apoptotic and oxidative stress conditions requires cellular response. rRNA degradation is strongly correlated with ROS levels and is connected with oxidative stress response. a potent l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was used to test whether there is a direct link between RNA fragmentation and ROS. the presence of 10mM ascorbic acid prior to treatment with standard doses of H2O2 almost totally abrogated degradation of the 25S rRNA. ectopic expression of murine Bcl-xL protein of the anti-apoptotic mammalian Bcl-2 family also strongly safeguarded the pRS314, B, lanes 1\u20134 and YEp51, C, lanes 1\u20133 were subjected to the same amounts of H2O2 by way of control reactions. this was assessed by testing the extent of the 25S rRNA degradation in different mutants defective in these pathways. in the first place, yca1 strain, lacking the only identified apoptotic metacaspase Yca1 in yeast, and aif1 cells not expressing the yeast apoptosis is a part of a yeast cell death pathway that involves histone modification. damage of ribosomes triggered by apoptotic stimuli is an early event. this scenario is consistent with most observations so far. gsh1 mutants lacking transcriptional factors involved in oxidative stress response. gpx1/2/3-, glutaredoxins grx1/2-, superoxide dismutases sod1/2- and peroxiredoxins prx- lacking Tsa1, Tsa2, Prx1, Dot5 and Ahp1 enzymes. gsh1 strain lacking -glutamylcysteine synthetase. oxidant mutants lacking all components of each enzymatic pathway exhibit a stronger effect on the 25S degradation than single mutants. this indicates that targeting rRNA degradation during oxidative stress may directly contribute to cell death. the level of total genomic and plasmid-derived 18S and 25S rRNAs was reduced to 70% in a strain transformed with the multicopy pJV12 plasmid expressing a tagged rDNA gene under the control of the constitutive PGK1 promoter (55), when compared to a strain transformed with vector alone. the basis of this effect is unclear, particularly that it was seen even though the tagged rRNA versions were expressed as confirmed by northern blot rRNA levels were lower by 15% in the latter case. this relatively modest difference in rRNA abundance led to a 10% decrease in survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress. rDNA expressed from a constitutive PGK1 promoter (PGK::rDNA, lane 1) compared with vector alone (lane 2). rRNA degradation depends on mitochondrial activity in the cell Mitochondria are the major source of endogenous ROS generated by oxidative phosphorylation. apoptotic cell death in yeast induced by acetic acid, pheromone and Bax expression was shown to be mediated by mitochondria. both mutants behaved in a similar manner as rho0 cells. the phenotype was stronger for op1 than upon deletion of the three carrier proteins, possibly due to a dominant negative effect in the point mutant. this was further supported by the degree of rRNA protection against oxidative damage caused by H2O2 observed for yeast cells grown on different carbon sources. degradation of 25S rRNA in apoptotic condition is related to mitochondrial respiration activity. mutants treated with varying amounts of H2O2 (A, WT lanes 1\u20134, rho0 lanes 5\u20138) and isogenic wild-type (lanes 1\u20133) treated with increasing concentrations of H2O2. RNAs are fragmented in stress and apoptotic conditions. we have performed treatments with low doses of oxidative agents. these included the inorganic H2O2 (concentrations 0.4\u20133 mM), superoxide-generating menadione (concentrations 0.05\u20130.6 mM), paraquat (concentrations 0.1\u201310 mM), thiol oxidant diamide (concentrations 0.1\u20130.2 mM), organic CHP ( ants elicit specific cellular responses that induce different groups of genes. rRNA fragmented in oxidative stress and apoptotic conditions. RNA from treatment with 0.6 mM H2O2 is shown in lane 5. 0.6 mM H2O2 is shown in lane 5 for comparison. analysis of chromosomal DNA by PFGE. samples from untreated cells for 200 min with 1 mM H2O2. chromosomal DNA from cells treated with H2O2 (1 mM), menadione (0.5 mM), CHP (0.2 mM), paraquat (5 mM), diamid (2 mM) and t-BHP (1 mM) for 200 min was analysed using PFGE. this is in a striking agreement with rRNA degradation that occurred only in H2O2 and menadione-treated cells. degradation pattern specific for each condition was shown in Figure 1E\u2013G for 25S in all apoptotic conditions and in Figure 1H for 5.8S during ageing. however, the general outcome of each treatment indicated differences in the course of events during each response. the occurrence of RNA degradation triggered by H2O2 was monitored during a time course between 5 and 60 min and over a broad range of concentrations. hybridizations of total yeast RNA extracted from wild-type cells treated with different concentrations of H2O2. arrow marked with a hatch shows a band matching the potential 3\u2032 product of the major cleavage, 5\u2032 product is marked with one asterisk. PCR reactions on cDNA prepared using total RNA from untreated control (lane 1, C) and cells treated with 1 mM H2O2 (lane 2). total RNA that had been ligated to an \u2018anchor\u2019 oligonucleotide (W242) with T4 RNA ligase was reverse transcribed using a primer specific for the anchor (W243) this followed by PCR reaction using the same 3\u2032 primer and the 5\u2032 primer starting at position +50 in s cleaved at +398\u2013403 (F-I) and +610\u2013611 (F-I), respectively. vertical bar in F-I indicates heterogenous 3\u2032 ends of products cleaved at +398\u2013403 in wild-type cells. different ROS-generating treatments that lead to yeast apoptosis, namely H2O2 and acetic acid, ageing and hyperosmotic shock, induce RNA fragmentation that most two of these cleavages, at positions +610\u2013611 and +398\u2013403, were mapped for treatment with 1 mM H2O2 by primer extension using primers W237 and W235. major cleavage sites were analysed in 16-day old chronologically aged cells using the same primers. this points to the action of single-stranded RNA nucleases. cleavages at site +398\u2013403 are shown in Figure 2E. cleavages at site +610\u2013611 are not affected by mutations in the exosome. this suggests that the cytoplasmic exosome may contribute to rRNA decay by digesting 3\u2032 ends of at least. RNA degradation process is enzymatic and not chemically induced by various reactive compounds. yeast cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min or with 70% ethanol for 30 min prior to exposure to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. similar approach was used to demonstrate that DNA damage in apoptotic yeast cells was an enzymatic process. rRNA degradation observed in apoptotic and oxidative stress conditions does not result in rRNA decay (Figure 1A) rRNA degradation is strongly correlated with ROS levels and is connected with oxidative stress response and apoptosis pathways. intensity of 25S rRNA degradation is correlated with ROS levels. the level of ROS was altered by pre-treatment with a potent anti-oxidant ascorbic acid and by the expression of the murine anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (B, lanes 5\u20138). rRNA degradation detected in all apoptotic conditions tested is independent of the two major apoptosis mediators, Yca1 and Aif1, and of other potential yeast caspases. treatment with translation inhibitor cycloheximide, that has been shown to prevent apoptotic cell death induced by H2O2 and acetic acid (29,36), had little or no effect on rRNA degradation. however, it appears that events in the course of damage of ribosomes triggered by apoptotic stimuli is an early event during the response, does not require protein synthesis, precedes caspase activation and acts as an upstream signal in the apoptotic pathway. this scenario is consistent with most observations so far. superoxide dismutases Sod1-2, glutathione peroxidases Gpx1-3, glutaredoxins Grx1-2, peroxiredoxins Tsa1-2, Prx1, Dot5 and Ahp1 and thioredoxin reductases Trr1-2 (24,52) these enzymes are required for protection against ROS either by catalysing the breakdown of oxidative compounds or by restoring natural intracellular redox equilibrium. enzymatic pathway exhibit a stronger effect on the 25S degradation than single mutants. this indicates that targeting rRNA degradation during oxidative stress may directly contribute to cell death. however, additional copies of rDNA present on a multicopy pNOY102 plasmid under control of the inducible GAL7 promoter did not affect the amount of any mature rRNA species. 12 showed a decreased viability already in the absence of oxidant (1.6-fold) and even more strikingly reduced following treatment with different concentrations of H2O2 (4.6-fold for 0.6 mM and 6.24 for for 1 mM, respectively) at 37\u00b0C, this strain ceases to grow but it sustains slow growth at 30\u00b0C due to reduced levels of mature rRNA. rRNA detects both 25S forms and with probe 046 specific for the tag within the plasmid-encoded 25S. the numbers below each lane, expressed as percentage, show the level of total, i.e. endogenous and plasmid-borne, mature 25S rRNA standardized to a U2 snRNA loading control. apoptotic cell death in yeast induced by acetic acid, pheromone and Bax expression was shown to be mediated by mitochondria (31,60) the correlation between mitochondria and rRNA stability was assessed by checking rRNA level in respiratory-deficient rho0 cells lacking mtDNA in conditions inducing apoptosis. all treatments resulted in a robust degradation of the 25S and 5.8S rRNAs in rho0 the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP (62\u201364) resulted in a moderate increase in the rRNA cleavage. this was further supported by the degree of rRNA protection against oxidative damage caused by H2O2. the most extensive RNA decay was observed in glucose, where a process called glucose repression discourages respiration. the most straightforward and fastest way to achieve translation inhibition is to target ribosomal RNA. repression of protein synthesis during UPR in human cells is due to the cleavage of 28S rRNA by hIRE1. to the 28S rRNA may act as a ribotoxic stress and induce an early death-committing signal through activation of SAP and MAP kinases (68,69). these possibilities were not examined in yeast PCD pathways. rRNA damage during apoptotic conditions in yeast can directly initiate cell death by activating signalling pathways. apoptotic stimuli in yeast generate ROS that are closely correlated with the onset or progression of PCD (71). rRNA degradation was more robust in oxidative stress defence mutants, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, where intracellular ROS is not properly neutralized. the closest yeast homologue of mammalian RNase L, Ire1, functions in the unconventional splicing of Hac1 pre-mRNA. it contains protein kinase and endoribonuclease domains similar to those in RNase L (72) but does not exclude its participation in other apoptotic pathways. rRNA degradation phenotype most likely accompanies apoptosis. only apoptosis-inducing oxidants result in rRNA decay. cell death caused by others probably occurs via a different mechanism. strains were reported to have somehow higher survival, but still die apoptotically (23,73) mitochondrial function is required for resistance to oxidative stress by way of detoxification or repair of the oxidative damage. mammalian rho0 cell lines undergo apoptosis in response to some but not all cell death-activating stimuli. several apoptotic mediators (Yca1, Aif1, Nma111, Bir1 and Ndi1) have been identified in yeast. apoptotic cell-death pathways in yeast induced by H2O2, acetic acid, hyperosmotic shock, ageing and increased mRNA stability were reported to require metacaspase Yca1 nominating them as caspase-dependent pathways. rRNA decay induced by apoptotic stimuli occurs during cell death pathway that involves ROS generation, mitochondrial activity, fragmentation of chromosomes and histone modification but not apoptotic regulators. stress stimuli induce signals, possibly via ROS, affecting different levels of gene expression, namely chromatin modifications, transcription and translation. the cascade of events leading to apoptosis is triggered (e.g. release of CytC and other mitochondrial factors to the cytoplasm) rRNA fragmentation occurs upstream of subsequent steps. rRNA fragmentation is an enzymatic process and depends on ROS generation. s, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, argue there is a direct link between ROS production and rRNA fragmentation. this is not the case, given that specific RNA fragmentation did not occur in cells fixed with formaldehyde or ethanol prior to treatment with H2O2. however, these enzymatic activities are still to be identified. we are currently testing several known yeast endo- an exo-nucleases for participation in apoptosis-related rRNA degradation. this function may involve not one but a number of unspecific nucleases, including mitochondrial Nuc1p, that act in a redundant fashion. the reason why treatment with some oxidative agents but not others produce fragmented RNA is not entirely clear. mitochondrial function is required for resistance to oxidative stress by way of detoxification or repair of the oxidative damage. mammalian rho0 cell lines undergo apoptosis in response to some but not all cell death-activating stimuli. mitochondrial function is required for resistance to oxidative stress by way of detoxification or repair of the oxidative damage. rRNA is markedly more stable when mitochondrial respiration is enhanced. this is consistent with the protective role of active mitochondria against the damaging effects of ROS on cellular components, rRNA destruction included. histone phosphorylation at Ser10 has been shown to mediate apoptosis independently of Yca1 (20,21) also, the activity of the major mitochondrial nuclease, Nuc1, in the cell-death pathway does not require either apoptotic mediators, Yca1 or Aif1, but is affected by H2B modifications. rRNA degradation coincides with apoptotic DNA fragmentation. overlapping PCD mechanisms have been described in the literature in recent years. stress stimuli induce signals, possibly via ROS, affecting different levels of gene expression. at this level, mitochondrial respiration helps to protect cellular components via adaptive mechanisms with anti-oxidant functions."}
