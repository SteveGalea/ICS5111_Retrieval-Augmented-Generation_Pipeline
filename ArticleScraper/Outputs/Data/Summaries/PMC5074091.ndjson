{"summary": "the MedSenseTM system uses a personalised electronic badge worn by each HCW, a set of beacons placed above each bed space, and detectors placed beneath each alcohol and soap dispenser. the system can also cause the badge to vibrate, if it detects that an opportunity is about to be missed. five outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)/carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) within a 13-month period, March 2014 to April 2015, occurring in a large acute teaching hospital. recommendations for future practice were made based on these experiences. a \u2018credit card\u2019 style alert card for patients to carry was developed. a protocol for the regular decontamination of sinks was developed. the organism responsible was isolated from clinical hand-washing sinks. results Of 992 patients screened, 41 (4.1%) were co-colonised with MRSA and VRE. the sub-acute (5.0%) and acute (4.1%) wards had more patients with MRSA-VRE co-colonisation than the intensive care units (1.9%). male gender (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1\u20134.4; P = 0.0322), prior admission within 1 year (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.3\u20135.8, P = 0.0066), and > the study population was predominantly elderly (67% aged 65 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 1.1:1. influenza A/H1N1-2009, nosocomial influenza (influenza positive 3 days after admission) and a higher Charlson score (p 0.001) were more likely among the cases. our findings highlighted that nosocomial influenza cases are more likely to become severely ill. increasing age amongst older individuals was an independent predictor of fatality. yearly influenza vaccination for healthcare workers and elderly patients is highly recommended. 28% of septic patients required admission to critical care. 17% of septic patients died. the Sepsis 6 is rarely being implemented within 1 hour. filtered water with successive cycles of decontamination with a chlorine-releasing bleach reduced the microbial load from > 300 to 1 CFU/100 ml. two decontamination cycles in a row were carried out to eliminate the risk of re-growth. commonly-used criteria, checklists and grading scales exist. there is a lack of patient input into their design. there is a lack of patient input into their design. mycobacteria were transmitted to the surgical site by aerosolisation of contaminated water from inside the HCU. in the UK, retrospective case findings identified 13 M. chimaera and M. intracellulare infections. the role of dressings to reduce surgical site infection (SSI) on closed primary wounds is controversial and in some types of surgery, it is unusual to apply a dressing. the bluebelle feasibility study had two phases: Phase A and phase B. the feasibility work has informed the design of a three-group pilot RCT. this will assess whether it is possible to recruit and for patients to maintain their treatment allocation. Declaration of conflicting interest No conflicts of interest to declare. 32% had no prior epidemiological contact with a known CPE case. 12% had no known risk factors. 88% of 25 patients had one or more of the risk factors that we recorded. 81 (1.9%) admissions that were CRE positive by PCR. only 4 (0.1%) were CRE positive by culture. none of 77 PCR positive, culture-negatives could be cultured by enrichment. new message was focused on the benefits of knowing CRE colonisation status to the patient and their peers. we calculated the association between age and the likelihood of self-collecting the rectal screen and the rate of CRE carriage by self-collected versus nurse-collected rectal screens. the MedSenseTM system uses a personalised electronic badge worn by each HCW, a set of beacons placed above each bed space, and detectors placed beneath each alcohol and soap dispenser. the system can correlate actions at dispensers with entry and exit to these patient areas. the system can also cause the badge to vibrate if it detects that an opportunity is about to be missed. the MedSenseTM system uses a personalised electronic badge worn by each HCW, a set of beacons placed above each bed space, and detectors placed beneath each alcohol and soap dispenser. the system can also cause the badge to vibrate, if it detects that an opportunity is about to be missed. five outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)/carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) within a 13-month period, March 2014 to April 2015, occurring in a large acute teaching hospital. a \u2018credit card\u2019 style alert card for patients to carry was used. five outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)/carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) within a 13-month period, March 2014 to April 2015, occurring in a large acute teaching hospital. a protocol for the regular decontamination of sinks was developed. the organism responsible was isolated from clinical hand-washing sinks. the significance of this finding is unknown and may be a topic for future study. the sub-acute (5.0%) and acute (4.1%) wards had more patients with MRSA-VRE co-colonisation than the intensive care units (1.9%). male gender, prior admission within 1 year (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.3\u20135.8, P = 0.0066) were positively associated with MRSA-VRE co-colonisation. patients with > 48 hours\u2019 hospital stay were screened for MRSA via nasal, axillary and groin swabs and for VRE and CRE via rectal swabs/stool testing. results Of 992 patients screened, 41 (4.1%) were co-colonised with MRSA and VRE, of whom two were also co-colonised with CRE. a retrospective case-control study was performed on patients admitted to a 1600-bed adult tertiary public hospital, between Jan 2011 and Dec 2014. severely ill influenza cases were those patients who required intensive care and/or died. 95%CI 1.99\u20135.29), congestive heart failure (AOR 3.91, 95%CI 2.70\u2013 5.67), renal disease (AOR 2.29, 95%CI 1.48\u20133.54) and any malignant tumour (AOR 4.01, 95%CI 1.48\u20138.07). a retrospective case-control study was performed on patients admitted to a 1600-bed adult tertiary public hospital, between Jan 2011 and Dec 2014. ourocomial influenza cases are more likely to become severely ill, and increasing age amongst older individuals was an independent predictor of fatality. our findings highlighted that nosocomial influenza cases are more likely to become severely ill, and increasing age amongst older individuals was an independent predictor. patients with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) can become septic, indicating severe infection. if not recognised and treated, severe infection can lead to morbidity and mortality. the management of septic patients relies on early detection and rapid implementation of measures including the Sepsis 6. patients with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) can become septic, indicating severe infection, which if not recognised and treated can lead to patient morbidity and mortality. atypical mycobacteria were transmitted to the surgical site by aerosolisation of contaminated water from within the unit. results were expressed as total viable counts (TVC) and reported as the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) per volume of sample (100 ml) 100 CFUs/100 ml was obtained; and after the second cycle of decontamination, a TVC of 1 CFU/100 ml was obtained. data from this study showed that the HCU used in cardiopulmonary surgery are microbiologically contaminated with coliforms, which could give serious infection risk. the use of filtered water with successive cycles of decontamination with a chlorine-releasing bleach reduced the microbial load from > 300 to 1 CFU/100 ml. a decontamination cycle is vital for these machines, with weekly microbiological water sample monitoring. a single measure for SSI assessment for patient self-reporting or observer completion was developed. Methods Content analyses of existing tools (CDC and ASEPSIS) and semi-structured interviews with patients and professionals (n = 19) identified domains potentially indicative of SSI. these domains were operationalised and drafted as questions (items) in lay language, using standard methods for designing patient questionnaires. interviews with patients and healthcare professionals used a \u2018think aloud\u2019 technique to test for understanding, accuracy and acceptability of a single measure for SSI assessment. the questionnaire was developed into a provisional questionnaire, comprising 13 items. a high level of localised aerosol at the rear of the HCU was detected. two possible areas of aerosol generation inside the HCU were identified using an aerodynamic Particle Sizer. a controlled laboratory study was conducted in a controlled environmental test chamber. a high level of localised aerosol at the rear of the HCU was detected. results A high level of localised aerosol at the rear of the HCU was detected. the bluebelle feasibility study had two phases: Phase A was preliminary work to establish how and Phase B was a pilot randomised controlled trial to determine whether it is possible to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of dressings. a survey of wound dressing use in general surgery (n = 702 patients; 1738 wounds); literature work and discussion to define and categorise different dressing types. the bluebelle feasibility study had two phases: Phase A was preliminary work to establish how and Phase B was a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) the feasibility work has informed the design of a pilot pilot RCT (tissue adhesive versus a simple adhesive dressing, versus no dressing) risk factors include hospitalisation abroad, travel abroad without hospitalisation and hospitalisation in the UK. 12% of patients had been hospitalised abroad, 28% had travelled abroad without hospitalisation, 64% had been hospitalised in the UK, 32% had no prior epidemiological contact with a known CPE case. risk factors include hospitalisation abroad, travel abroad without hospitalisation, hospitalisation in the UK, and known epidemiological contact with another CPE case. 12% of patients had been hospitalised abroad, 28% had travelled abroad without hospitalisation, 64% had been hospitalised in the UK, 32% had no prior epidemiological contact with a known CPE case. universal admission screening in London Jonathan Otter, Eleonora Dyakova, Karen N Bisnauthsing, Antonio Querol-Rubiera, Amita Patel, Chioma Ahanonu, Olga Tosas Auguet, Jonathan D Edgeworth and Simon D Goldenberg Centre for Clinical Infection and Diagnostics Research. PCR appeared to be considerably more sensitive than culture for detecting CRE. a low proportion of admitted patients had received healthcare abroad, but almost 50% had received healthcare in the UK. only healthcare abroad or overseas residence were associated with CRE carriage. overseas residents and 55.9% had taken antibiotics in the past 12 months. PCR appeared to be considerably more sensitive than culture for detecting CRE. a low proportion of admitted patients had received healthcare abroad, but almost 50% had received healthcare in the UK. patients who declined to participate were asked whether this was because of the rectal swab. the rate of decline was 28.7% before the change in message and 5.4% after the change (p 0.01, Fisher\u2019s exact test) patients who declined to participate were asked whether this was because of the rectal swab. the study was approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee. the rate of decline was 28.7% before the change in message. the isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics except meropenem and amikacin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations were all 2 mg/L. P. stuartii express natural resistance to tigecycline and colistin. development of full resistance to all carbapenems in P. stuartii may lead to awkward situation for clinicians. historic or previous and pre-treatment or baseline isolates were genetically characterised using spa typing, from which the sequence type was inferred. of the 30 patients treated with mupirocin, 26 completed the study. the antibiotics tested included amikacin, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem and meropenem. the carbon dioxide concentrations tested included 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% carbon dioxide. extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infections have increased significantly within the community population over the previous 4 years. most of these isolates are from patients living in their own homes, not from hospitals and care home environments where monitoring and microbiology advice regarding prudent prescribing is much more accessible. 80% of sternal wound swabs of recently discharged patients were lost to follow-up. this is often due to the misconception that the infection control team routinely reviews all microbiology results. methods Our Trust created a Surveillance via Queries system. preliminary results indicated 40% of patients benefit from new targeted antibiotic therapy or a change from broad-spectrum regimens. early identification and management of SSIs may influence morbidity and resource utilisation associated with advanced cases in the community. doripenem had a high treatment success rate (86%) for treating BTI caused by ESBL-producing organisms. the two cases of treatment failure were diagnosed as BTI accompanied by septic shock, where one had an old stroke and one had hepatic carcinoma. methods 132 HCPs reviewed clinical notes from eight most recent patients weighing over 40 kgs and treated with an echinocandin for prevention or treatment of a suspected or confirmed Candida infection. a total of 868 patient records were matched for age, weight, gender and neutropenic status across the three treatment groups. from this, we calculated the average dose per treatment day and cost per treatment day. four Providencia stuartii (P. stuartii) isolates with intermediate resistance to imipenem were isolated between March 2013 and June 2014. the isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics except meropenem and amikacin. P. stuartii is known to express natural resistance to tigecycline and colistin. the development of full resistance to all carbapenems in P. stuartii may lead to an awkward situation for clinicians. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were all 2 mg/L. none of the known imipenem resistance genes was identified. ompPst1 of P. stuartii demonstrates a decreased level of permeation. increased mupirocin use predisposes to mupirocin resistance (MR) there is a strong association between previous mupirocin exposure and both low- and high-level MR (HLMR) mupirocin is an important component in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. increased mupirocin use predisposes to mupirocin resistance (MR) 14 (47%) patients were decolonised after one or two courses. 12 (40%) remained persistently colonised. mupirocin susceptibility of most sequential isolates was unchanged. levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, imipenem and meropenem were all resistant. all results were resistant. all results were resistant. the carbon dioxide concentrations tested included 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% carbon dioxide. results for amikacin, the zone sizes were 15, 15, 14 and 15 mm, in 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% carbon dioxide, respectively. all results were resistant. Is have increased significantly within the community population over the previous 4 years. most isolates are from patients living in their own homes, not from hospitals and care home environments where monitoring and microbiology advice regarding prudent prescribing is much more accessible. urinary tract infections (UTIs) have increased significantly within the community population over the previous 4 years. most of these isolates are from patients living in their own homes, not from hospitals and care home environments where monitoring and microbiology advice regarding prudent prescribing is much more accessible. 80% of sternal wound swabs of recently discharged patients were lost to follow-up. a novel wound surveillance system allowed for a 100% capture of patients with positive sternal swabs. early identification and management of SSIs may influence morbidity and resource utilisation associated with advanced cases in the community. 80% of sternal swabs of recently discharged patients were lost to follow-up. the patient questionnaire revealed their preference towards efficient community care, as guided by the newly-adopted system. early identification and management of SSIs may influence the morbidity and resource utilisation associated with advanced cases in the community. ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 94% (n = 15) and 6% (n = 1), respectively, of the offending pathogens. doripenem had a high treatment success rate (86%) for treating BTI caused by ESBL-producing organisms. ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 94% (n = 15) and 6% (n = 1), respectively, of the offending pathogens. doripenem had a high treatment success rate (86%) for treating BTI caused by ESBL-producing organisms. however, those cases of treatment failure had serious infection and underlying disease. 868 patient records were matched for age, weight, gender and neutropenic status across the three treatment groups. for each patient record, the HCP was asked to report: echinocandin maintenance dose (excluding any initial loading dose), duration of treatment (days) and dose adjustment (time to adjustment and new dose) from this, we calculated the average dose per treatment day, and cost per treatment day. the aim of this market research was to establish the average dose of micafungin used in a typical population, and to compare this with the other two echinocandins: anidulafungin and caspofungin. a total of 868 patient records were matched for age, weight, gender and neutropenic status across the three treatment groups. the colour-coded card system (red/yellow/green) is currently on trial in one of the hospital sites within the Trust for 6 months. if a staff member was seen breaching infection control policy on a second occasion, they could be given a red card. the red card, in contrast to the yellow card, would result in remedial action. a green card would be given for exceptional good practice noted. a simple data base will be used in order to collate information on the staff members\u2019 name; line manager and ward in which it occurred. the system gives real-time feedback of hand hygiene compliance to patients and staff via light emitting diods and wireless networks. it can identify when an individual cleans their hands with soap and water or alcohol gel, and when they have come in to contact a patient. feedback reports are provided to all staff and senior management teams regularly. methodology audits of HH facilities and practice at predetermined intervals commenced in 2005. HH practice improved from 46% to 90.7%. online training access doubled the training uptake. the first results of an innovative multifactorial method, the Infection Risk Scan (IRIS) the scan measures several outcome and process parameters and gives visual feedback to healthcare workers (HCW), using an easy-to-read plot. results were visualised in a risk profile showing patient-related risks. in 2010, the infection Prevention and Control Team began to undertake a daily checklist review for all patients with CDI. this later became known as the daily review checklist process (DRCP), which included feedback at the ward and organisational levels. results Staff perceived the DRCP had been influential in the care and management of patients with CDI. the DRCP evolved from a checklist serving as an instrument of surveillance and monitoring to an interactive educative facilitative process, assisting staff in the care and management of patients with CDI. the influence of a human factors approach and the impact that communication, teamwork, situated learning and leadership had on behavioural change and improved patient outcomes. staff are often uncomfortable with change and there is a strong need to continue working alongside frontline staff to engage and encourage ownership and compliance. a future piece of work needs to be commenced looking for trends in relation to cleaning scores and infection rates. wards achieved 100 consecutive days free of C. difficile. staff showed awareness of their own rates, and demonstrated interest in investigating cases. initial impressions suggested the IPCT did not fully understand specifically maternity, paediatric and neonatal issues; sometimes negative interactions. this hindered communication and implementation of the IPC guidelines and processes. Methods An improvement plan was launched. Methods Infection Prevention and Control nurses (IPCNs) and Tissue Viability Nurses evaluated the products and four wards of different patient demographics trialled the OasisTM disposable bed-bathing system. key outcomes tested against were time spent on the bed bath, cost, and clinician and patient satisfaction. staff acceptance of the products was high, with clear benefits demonstrated to both patient satisfaction and dignity. the product was initially leased throughout a variety of wards and departments to improve compliance with hand hygiene and other SICPs. the implementation team comprised infection prevention and control staff and members of our external partner, SureWash. the product was based on video gaming and using gesture recognition technology. a mixed-methods study was conducted in a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital in singapur. the data were analysed using the framework approach. staff acknowledged that hand hygiene was a critical component of patient care. but many perceived senior colleagues as role models for hand hygiene. staff recognised the importance of hand hygiene, but faced practical barriers that reduced compliance. role modelling by senior staff, and external reminders and nudges by team members could enhance hand hygiene compliance. standard operating protocol to ensure side-room posters are kept up to date daily, staff education regarding side-room infection control, as well as a computer desktop-based electronic poster side-room infection control day. if signage is effective, it must be accurate, consistent and observed by all. infection control is not going to get any better until nurses feel empowered to initiate change and deal with the practical difficulties that impact on good infection control. the colour-coded card system (red/yellow/green) is currently on trial in one of the hospital sites within the Trust for 6 months. a red card could also be given after a specified number of unrelated yellow cards are received. the red card would result in remedial action (for example, notifying the ward manager) it is anticipated that yellow cards would represent the bulk of the scheme, with red cards useful mostly as a last resort. a conversation between an Infection Prevention Nurse and a medical consultant led to the formation of a Listening into Action group. the colour-coded card system (red/yellow/green) is currently on trial in one of the hospital sites within the Trust for 6 months. the database will allow the infection prevention team to identify trends of poor-performing staff groups and wards, as well as individuals. the vision for this scheme is to review at the end of the 6-month trial and see if they have made the expected impact. it is envisioned that handing a card to a staff member will have a powerful impact. audit compliance normally relies on observation of practice by individuals. the results of these audits are regularly in the 85\u2013100% range. it is well documented that adherence to hand hygiene practice is actually 40\u201360%. over 2500 observational hand hygiene audits were completed over a 2-month period. the aim of this trial at CMFT is to determine if the monitoring system improved the rate of hand hygiene compliance. the technology used may also be used for other technology in the future, to support other nursing duties. HH practice improved from 46% to 90.7%. online training access doubled the training uptake. alcohol hand gel (AHG) use increased from 23.6 L/1000 bed days to 38.1/L. HH practice improved from 46% to 90.7%. online training access doubled the training uptake. alcohol hand gel (AHG) use increased from 23.6 L/1000 bed days. the results were visualised in a risk profile showing patient-related risks and an improvement-plot showing risks that can be influenced by HCW. we performed IRIS three times in a 2-year period, according to the \u2018Plan-Do-Check-Act\u2019 methodology. the results were visualised in a risk profile showing patient-related risks. we performed IRIS three times in a 2-year period, according to the \u2018Plan-Do-Check-Act\u2019 methodology. Background Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) has the potential to be a severe or fatal infection. the DRCP evolved from a checklist serving as an instrument of surveillance and monitoring to an interactive educative facilitative process. in 2010, the Infection Prevention and Control Team began to undertake a daily checklist review for all patients with CDI. this later became known as the daily review checklist process (DRCP) the reviews included feedback at the ward and organisational levels, and incorporated completion of a checklist through contemporaneous clinical patient assessment. the IPCN started working alongside and training front-line staff personally to gain an understanding of the organisation\u2019s diverse culture. despite that frontline staff are more engaged in EC practices and now have increased ownership, more work is needed on encouragement of collaborative work between staff groups. the IPCN started working alongside front-line staff personally to gain an understanding of the organisation\u2019s diverse culture. despite that frontline staff are more engaged in EC practices and now have increased ownership, more work is needed on encouragement of collaborative work between staff groups. staff were aware of Trust targets and incidences of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) but showed less awareness of C. difficile incidence attributable to their own areas. a database was developed to track how many days each area achieved. 50% of wards achieving over 1 year of being clear of C. difficile. some approaching 1000 days free. focus remains on engaging staff with issues surrounding C. difficile causation and transmission. a midwife with interest in IPC was seconded to the IPCT for 2 days a week. this hindered communication and implementation of the IPC guidelines and processes. personalised training sessions were devised and delivered to the staff. a midwife with interest in IPC was seconded to the IPCT for 2 days a week. initial impressions suggested the IPCT did not fully understand specifically maternity, paediatric and neonatal issues. personalised training sessions were devised and delivered to the staff. evidence for improved collaboration was seen with W&CS staff. proactively contacting the IPCT for advice, and encouraging attendance at the link nurses\u2019 meeting launch (n = 10) all nurses surveyed rated the products as \u2018Good\u2019 and 94% would use them again. 77.3% found the system \u2018Significantly better\u2019 or \u2018Better\u2019 than the traditional methods. clinical procurement is supporting the uptake of the products across all four trial wards. all nurses surveyed rated the OasisTM products as \u2018Good\u2019 and 94% would use them again. 77.3% found the system \u2018Significantly better\u2019 or \u2018Better\u2019 than the traditional methods. staff were responsible for completing education and training and logging into the system using their hospital ID badge. results Throughout the implementation plan, there were a total of 2010 staff interactions with SureWash. results Throughout the implementation plan, there were a total of 2010 staff interactions with SureWash. an increase in hand hygiene was achieved with staff also gaining further knowledge and understanding of other SICPs and TBPs. funding has since been secured and four units were purchased. of 1066 staff, the proportion who reported good hand hygiene compliance (> 90% of the time): nurses, 40.1%; AHPs, 31.0%; and physicians, 22.8% (p 0.01). after adjusting for gender; staff category; years in their profession; seniority; history of dermatitis. staff recognised the importance of hand hygiene, but faced practical barriers that reduced compliance. staff felt gentle reminders and nudges from team members and \u201chand hygiene-buddies\u201d could enhance hand hygiene compliance. we conducted a cross-sectional observational study at a central London hospital. we investigated concordance with isolation policy, identify potential at-risk incidents, and explore the underlying barriers and facilitators for optimal use of isolation rooms. the study involved comparison of signage with patient infective status. sectional observational study at a central London hospital investigated concordance with isolation policy, identify potential at-risk incidents, and explore the underlying barriers and facilitators for optimal use of isolation rooms. results Inaccurate signage was found in 25% of cases in the first study and 46% in the second, and side-room doors were open in 32% and 34% of the rooms containing an infectious patient. study recruited 25 qualified paediatric nurses from different paediatric areas. results suggest paediatric nurses are willing to comply with SPGs. but they fail sometimes to achieve their goal. study recruited 25 qualified paediatric nurses from different paediatric areas. results suggest paediatric nurses are willing to comply with SPGs. but they fail sometimes to achieve their goal. wards contaminated with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have no criteria for environmental cleaning. the bacteria were harvested with a cotton swab. the number of remaining bacteria after wiping with Wipe B and Wipe C was 150.4 69.2 CFU and 134.4 117.6 CFU respectively. the remaining bacteria in the non-woven fabric containing the disinfection with benzalconium chloride and dodecyl methyl ammonium chloride (Wipe A) was significantly less than the other tools (p 0.01). CD050 was recovered 11 consecutive days after a patient with CDI was discharged. the bed space was widely contaminated (CD002; CD010; NT) symptomatic infection was reported 3 days later, and sequencing confirmed that the environmental and clinical isolates (CD002) were indistinguishable. this quantitative study evaluates the ability of a range of technologies to decontaminate iPads. the front, back and sides of the iPad were contaminated with a standard suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. the other half was decontaminated with either alcohol wipes, detergent wipes, quaternary ammonium-impregnated wipes, or exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) for either 30 or 60 seconds. new technologies have become available in recent years, including improved and automated hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) and more recently, ultraviolet light-based decontamination systems (UVCs) this study explores the integration of UVC as an adjunctive cleaning practice. the advent of disinfectant wipes has provided a promising option for improving the quality of environmental disinfection. there is scant data on the acceptability of disinfectant wipes. 98% agreed that access to cleaning products is quicker and closer to the point of use. the infection prevention, critical care and facilities teams established a new team of housekeeping assistants with the sole responsibility of completing bed-space cleaning following discharge of patients. up to 20 beds per day require cleaning and setting up, which impacted on time available for care-giving duties. 76 cases of Clostridium difficile toxin-positive infection were apportioned in 2014-2015. commode inspections identified dirty commodes even after they were declared as being cleaned. commode cleaning competency was developed in 2015. the acceptance of foam formulae is still in a growth phase in the healthcare environment. the foam ABHR met EN 1500 requirements when applied for 30 seconds and met EN 12791 requirements when applied for 120 seconds. iliensis were 3.5 and 4.2, respectively, indicating acceptable skin tolerability. results showed foam ABHR can achieve high-level and broad-spectrum efficacy, as well as excellent skin compatibility. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of electrolysed water products by boards across the national health service in Scotland. the results of this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of electrolysed water products by boards across the national health service (NHS) in Scotland. despite the findings of this and other HPV studies, the role of standard decontamination processes remains integral to its effectiveness. despite the findings of this and other studies, the role of standard decontamination processes remains integral to its effectiveness. of the five alternative methods of decontamination reviewed, electrolysed water showed the most promise as an alternative. details are included in the abstract on the use of steam, microfibre, UV light, hydrogen peroxide and electrolysed water as alternative methods of decontamination by NHS Scotland. commercial disinfectants and antiseptics were ineffective at or close to their working concentration, against several different MDR pathogens including carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae. when grown in simple biofilms, the number of strains resistant to the biocide increases, for many of the biocide-pathogen combinations. four patients were admitted to a neighbouring trust on a medical ward. the case was admitted to a single room for isolation on the ward. despite patient isolation, the organism had spread to other ward areas. outbreak highlighted the need to carefully examine practice in clinical areas. two wards were chosen with similar patient pathways, one as a test ward and one as a control ward. the Sanicare Compliance Programme was implemented in the test ward, but there were no interventions within the control ward. a patient equipment and environment compliance monitoring tool was devised by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of this compliance quality improvement monitoring tool for patient equipment/environmental cleaning. there are no criteria for environmental cleaning of the surfaces in wards contaminated with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in japan, there are no criteria for environmental cleaning of the surfaces in wards. with Wipe B and Wipe C were 150.4 69.2 CFU and 134.4 117.6 CFU respectively. the remaining bacteria in the non-woven fabric containing the disinfection with benzalconium chloride was significantly less than the other tools. the remaining bacteria were harvested with a cotton swab in a standardised way. the significance level was 5%. the remaining bacteria were not detected after wiping with Wipe A. 5% of the surfaces in the near-patient-area were contaminated with C. difficile. PCR ribotyping revealed a diverse population of C. difficile strains. in three cases ribotyping suggested more than contemporaneous shedding from the patient. 301 sites were sampled and 35% of the surfaces in the near-patient-area were contaminated with C. difficile. PCR ribotyping revealed a diverse population of C. difficile strains. ribotyping suggested more than contemporaneous shedding from the patient. a quantitative study evaluates the ability of a range of technologies to decontaminate iPads. results The alcohol-based wipes were most effective, generating on average a 2 log reduction on the back of the iPad and a 3 log reduction on the front. a quantitative study evaluates the ability of a range of technologies to decontaminate iPads. results The alcohol-based wipes were most effective, generating on average a 2 log reduction on the back of the iPad and a 3 log reduction on the front. this suggests that UV-based decontamination technology would provide a quick, efficient and economical method for the disinfection of mobile devices such as iPads. UVC technology is easy to set up, enabling it to be used by a wide range of staff. such systems have the potential to be used as a preventative adjunct to manual cleaning, and may greatly reduce the risk of transmitting infections through high-touch surfaces. disinfectant wipes have the potential to be used as a preventative adjunct to manual cleaning. such systems have the potential to be used as a preventative adjunct to manual cleaning. 5% agreed that the wipes appeared effective in cleaning the environment. 97% agreed that wipes with disinfectant in them already are a familiar concept. 82% agreed that the training for the wipes was useful and complete. 82% of staff agreed that the training for the wipes was useful and complete. some evidence that the training provided around the wipes could be improved. is scope for using bed-space cleaning teams in other departments in the hospital. further measures of improvement could potentially demonstrate the effect of the project on complaints relating to cleanliness and incidence of infection. 76 cases of Clostridium difficile toxin-positive infection were trust apportioned. commode inspections had identified dirty commodes even after they were declared as being cleaned. a standard operating procedure was developed in 2012 with a 15-step picture guide. commode inspections identified dirty commodes after they were declared clean. a standard operating procedure was developed in 2012 with a 15-step picture guide. commode cleaning competency followed the Witnessed, Assimilated and Supervised principles. the trust has a zero tolerance approach to any commode deemed not clean. no conflicts of interest to declare. the acceptance of foam formulae is still in a growth phase in healthcare. albicans and aspergillus brasiliensis were 3.5 and 4.2 respectively. quantitative skin measures of HCW hands did not change significantly. results showed that foam ABHR can achieve high-level and broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy, as well as excellent skin compatibility. mean log reductions for Candida albicans and Aspergillus brasiliensis were 3.5 and 4.2. results showed foam ABHR can achieve high-level and broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy, as well as excellent skin compatibility. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of electrolysed water products by boards across the national health service (NHS) in Scotland. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of electrolysed water products. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of electrolysed water products by boards across the national health service (NHS) in Scotland. despite the findings of this and other HPV studies, the role of standard decontamination processes remains integral to its effectiveness. the role of standard decontamination processes remains integral to its effectiveness and should not be forgotten. despite the findings of this and other HPV studies, the role of standard decontamination processes remains integral to its effectiveness and should not be forgotten, when considering new technologies. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of steam, microfibre, UV light, hydrogen peroxide and electrolysed water as alternative methods of decontamination by NHS Scotland. the results from this literature review were used to inform recommendations on the use of steam, microfibre, UV light, hydrogen peroxide and electrolysed water as alternative methods of decontamination by NHS Scotland. emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens means that there is an increasing dependency on disinfection and antisepsis to control infections. emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens means that there is an increasing dependency on disinfection and antisepsis to control infections. xidine-containing formulations were tested against planktonic cultures and biofilms. the clinical strains were also exposed to sub-lethal levels of biocide. the ability to adapt to exposure was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic methods. the outbreak occurred on a medical ward involving four patients who had NDM New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) isolated. the outbreak was recognised on the basis of reference laboratory typing reports showing the same variable number tandem repeat profiles on clinical samples that had isolated K. pneumoniae. the outbreak occurred on a medical ward involving four patients who had Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated, including one during an admission to a neighbouring trust. the outbreak was recognised on the basis of reference laboratory typing reports showing the same variable number tandem repeat profiles on clinical samples that had isolated K. pneumoniae. an investigation ensued, to explore possible methods of transmission on the ward. Foundation Trust Derby, UK Background Shared clinical equipment used to deliver care in the clinical environment can act as a vehicle by which micro-organisms are transferred between patients. wards were chosen with similar patient pathways, one as a test ward and one as a control ward. wards were chosen with similar patient pathways, one as a test ward and one as a control ward. a qualitative and quantitive audit was undertaken in both the control and test wards. only the visually clean surfaces were swabbed. ring tool Annette Rankin, Heather Wallace, Faiza Hansraj and Hayley Kane a patient equipment and environment compliance monitoring tool was devised by health protection Scotland (HPS) the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of this compliance quality improvement monitoring tool for patient equipment/environmental cleaning, for national health service boards. 230 staff have undergone training appropriate to their role, including 64 to manage confirmed Ebola/VHF cases in either a Trexler Isolator or in personal protective equipment (PPE)-based High Level Isolation. 230 staff have undergone training appropriate to their role, including 64 to manage confirmed Ebola/VHF cases. Previously-published investigations report high seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies among Malaysians, especially in citizens employed within the Municipal Services. sociodemographic factors were assessed to implicate the economic burden that will eventually increase the social cost of combating leptospirosis in the local community. the unprecedented epidemic of Ebola \u2018Zaire\u2019 in west africa, affecting over 27,000 people to date and with over 11,000 deaths, put the UK on high alert to ensure readiness for safe management of cases entering the country. 230 staff have undergone training appropriate to their role, including 64 to manage confirmed Ebola/VHF cases. 230 staff have undergone training appropriate to their role, including 64 staff to manage confirmed Ebola/VHF cases in either a Trexler Isolator or in personal protective equipment (PPE)-based High Level Isolation. a substantial legacy has been left from this work which will be built upon, to ensure readiness to manage any organisms requiring high-level isolation. most of the reported cases emerged following a natural disaster in any of the reporting countries. Previously-published investigations report high seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies among Malaysians. this is true because those workers are exposed to waste materials generally in contact with rodents. most of the reported cases emerged following a natural disaster in any of the reporting countries. reportable cases of human leptospirosis in Malaysia increased unexpectedly, following massive floods early in 2015. Previously-published investigations report high seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies among Malaysians. the effect of patient intervention by nurses systematically trained in infectious disease care Kiyomi Hosoda1 and Aiko Koh2 1Fukuiken Saiseikai Hospital, Japan 2Japanese Nursing Association, Japan Background With systematic educational training in infection control and prevention (ICP) for 630 hours and certification by the Japanese Nursing Association for experience specializing in ICP, nurses were given the opportunity to learn the medical knowledge about infectious disease practice. of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reduced by 10%. mortality rate from MRSA sepsis decreased by 3% after this action. IPCT have analysed campaign responses to identify educational targets for both Sepsis September 2015 and their on-going MRSA awareness work. 50% of respondents were unclear about sepsis survival rates and 40% lacked knowledge of sepsis prevalence. a standard operating procedure (SOP) was implemented for staff to follow if ingress or holes were found. the IPCT designed cleaning tape for staff to attach to a clean, ingress-free mattress so they knew it was safe for the next patient. the catheter group devised a care pathway, implemented in 2008. it was used as a documentation tool around insertion and on-going care of catheters. HOUDINI was added to the pathway to help nurses assess whether a urinary catheter was required. the placement would cover the management of: meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Clostridium difficile and Norovirus. the student would also have an opportunity to suggest two learning outcomes of their own. staff education was delivered at the ward level, to ensure staff attendance. the topics covered included a definition of C. difficile and associated risks, management of a patient with diarrhoea. user views of 41 participants collected through group interviews, self-completed questionnaires and discrete choice scenario evaluation. results The majority correctly identified the incidence of HCAIs in England and gave meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) as examples. medical services training centre (AMSTC) were tasked with design, construct, deliver, validate and assure training for what was described as the \u201cmost dangerous medical mission ever undertaken by the Defence Medical Services\u201d the aim was to provide individual and collective training, in order to expose personnel to the challenges of working in full personal protective equipment (PPE) the code of practice for nurses and midwives in the uk sets the current standards of conduct, performance and ethics. a requirement of this code is that practitioners use the best possible evidence to deliver care. an immersive simulation exercise was undertaken as part of the IPC Link Practitioner programme. the 20-minute exercise simulated routine nursing care of a bed-bound patient on a medical ward. the aim of the exercise was to make link practitioners more aware of the critical importance of IPC precautions in preventing avoidable infections. training in the national health service (NHS) Foundation Trust has been designed to give key messages to a large number of people in a short time, via didactic presentations. staff and discussions within the IPC team suggested key messages around IPC were not always well understood nor translated into clinical practice. the national health service conducts approximately 54,600 cannulations a year. aseptic technique is vital to maintain the fistular viability and reduce the risk of access-related complications. 68 observations showed compliance rates increased from 75\u201380% to 90\u2013100%. a repetitive task, such as the aseptic technique, may mean staff may have developed behaviours that can be difficult to change. the proportion of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reduced by 10%. the mortality rate from MRSA sepsis decreased by 3% after this action. the \u201cselecting and administering of antibiotics\u201d was not allowed for nurses until now. the proportion of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reduced by 10%, and the mortality rate from MRSA sepsis decreased by 3% after this action. the importance of active engagement of healthcare professionals with infection prevention education is no conflicts of interest to declare. the IPCT have analysed campaign responses to identify educational targets for both Sepsis September 2015 and their on-going MRSA awareness work. 50% of respondents were unclear about sepsis survival rates and 40% lacked knowledge of sepsis prevalence. \u201cMr. Grey has MRSA\u201d: an email and paper-based quiz available to all Trust staff testing their sepsis knowledge.

Clostridium difficile was identified within the Trust over a 3-month period. 90% of these cases occurred within two separate divisions. staff education was identified as a key issue in both areas. education was delivered at the ward level to ensure staff attendance. topics covered included a definition of C. difficile and associated risks, management of a patient with diarrhoea in a ward setting, hand hygiene and environmental decontamination. of 41 participants (15 carers and 26 patients with a recent experience of in-patient hospital care in London) were collected through group interviews, self-completed questionnaires and discrete choice scenario evaluation. results The majority of respondents correctly identified the incidence of HCAIs in England and gave meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile as examples. the majority of respondents correctly identified the incidence of HCAIs in England and gave meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) as examples. the lack of and potential role of general practitioners in monitoring HCAIs was raised by users. a facsimile facility was created and Closed-circuit television installed, for training and safety purposes. specially designed adjuncts were utilised for live needle use, with an ultraviolet trace inserted into simulated blood products and bodily fluids. ability to body map all personnel allowed an assurance that doffing procedures were effective and safe. the use of simulation training brought huge confidence to the deploying force that their new skills and policies would allow them to treat patients without the threat of becoming a casualty themselves. the success of these efforts was witnessed by the safe return of personnel in contact with patients infected with Ebola. the session was run by a researcher experienced in focus groups who was not involved in the MSc program. participants identified a lack of formal mathematical training in their previous nursing education. mainly simple mathematics was required in their previous work. results Group members identified a lack of formal mathematical training in their previous nursing education. participants reported using descriptive statistics (e.g. counts) in their report writing. mainly simple mathematics was required in their previous nursing education. a transparent ultraviolet light (UV) reacting gel was applied to the hands of nurses. after the simulation, the lights were switched off to darken the room. each participant \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that the simulation was beneficial. a transparent ultraviolet light (UV) reacting gel was applied to the hands of nurses. after the simulation, the lights were switched off to darken the room. each participant \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that the simulation was beneficial. workshops included meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) management, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) stations. formal staff opinions were not sought pre-intervention, but informal discussions with staff revealed insufficient practical detail. workshops included meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) management, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) stations. informal discussions with staff revealed that insufficient practical detail was provided during traditional sessions. fistula (AVF) has a reduced risk of complication and an increased long-term viability; therefore, it is considered the optimal vascular access. aseptic technique prior to cannulation and upon connecting to the dialysis machine is vital in preventing infection. the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) has a reduced risk of complication. the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) has an increased long-term viability. it is considered the optimal vascular access. at least 22 pathogens/pathogen groups with HCAI/HCAO potential have emerged over the past 40 years. new national guidance and new pathogen-specific must dos are needed. no recognised HCAI challenge has thus far been negated. each new threat is responded to with pathogen-specific actions. this work demonstrates the importance of maintaining the IPCT resource. HCAI burden omits not just outbreaks but also an estimate of outbreak potential, e.g. patients admitted from the community with alert organisms and/or communicable diseases. estimates of HCAI burden should include both outbreaks and the resources needed to prevent outbreaks. methods ICNet developed a surgical site infection (SSI) module. these forms were then populated with data already collected within the ICNet. this includes the automatic importing of data from other software systems. in the state of Victoria, the health service compliance target was raised to 80% in 2015. the \u201c5 moments\u201d are an indirect measure for the potential for infection across five domains, but some of the domains predominate in data recording. the antibiotics tested included cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, levofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. PFGE patterns were interpreted as the same (no band difference), similar ( 3-band differences), or different ( 4-band differences) strains. zae were isolated from different hospital patients (HP1, HP2 and HP3). a study was conducted to detect an outbreak. the mechanisms of ceftazidime resistance were also investigated. the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) within acute hospitals in Scotland in 2011 was found to be 4.9%. of these, 18.6% were SSIs. the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) within acute hospitals in Scotland was found to be 4.9%. the overall rate of endopthalmitis was 0.04%. there was no clear linkage between the presence of a microbiology sample and the presence of a SSI in colorectal surgery. all isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, but universally susceptible to chloramphenicol and linezolid. PFGE typing suggested there were predominant strains of genetically similar E. faecium recovered from across the Trust. electronic wound documentation was piloted and successfully implemented by one surgical directorate. monthly and quarterly SSIS reports were sent to clinical directorates. results Trends in incidence of infection have been established for the last 6 years. electronic wound documentation was piloted and successfully implemented within the directorate. a multidisciplinary collaborative approach was adopted to ensure the best evidence-based practice for all patients. a nurse was nominated to drive electronic wound documentation. Staphylococcus aureus has become a global cause of community-acquired infections. in europe, the majority of reported PVL-MRSA cases have been community associated. EMRSA-15 (ST22-IV) is dominant in the hospital setting. our study highlights the potential risk of spread of this clone in the healthcare setting and the potential pathogenicity of this clone in relation to the bacteraemias seen. multidrug resistant bacteria present in almost all hospitals of the world. tobacter baumanii (A. baumannii) resistant to carbapenemase were present in 60% of patients colonized/infected by MDR bacteria. meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was in 35% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) resistant to carbapanemase was in 13%. the main wards that colonized/infected patients stay overseas residence in high-risk countries may be a risk factor for CRE. a retrospective study was conducted using residential postcodes to establish the proportion of overseas residents admitted to the Trust from high-prevalence areas. the pre-emptive isolation of these patients would account for 5% of the Trust\u2019s annual isolation bed days. data is useful to assist with timely flagging of potential clusters of carbapenemase-producing isolates. a cluster of 29 NDM-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was identified in the latter months of the study. each inpatient ward was visited and the number of beds and single rooms was counted. if single rooms had an en-suite was also captured. the overall proportion of single rooms with an en-suite was 19.1%. a detailed dataset can be used to identify potential lapses in care. results Of 83 E. coli BSI, 30 had a urinary source, 13 of which were considered catheter-associated urinary tract infections. of the six MRSA BSI cases, documentation of intravenous access devices was incomplete or missing. environmental hygiene is a crucial component of infection prevention and control. it is difficult to define \u201cclean\u201d without objective measures of environmental hygiene. using fluorescent marks and microbiological cultures as an endpoint evaluation of the cleaning results are two objective measures. the multidisciplinary team performing root cause analysis wanted to examine whether the number of cases seen could be due to two key locally agreed-upon potential lapses in care. three cases were found to have antibiotic policy non-compliance (one incorrect agent, one no documentation and one with no stop or review date) we only identified a potential lapse of care in 10% of cases. majority of cases acquire their C. difficile elsewhere and develop C. difficile infection as a result of appropriate antibiotic use. swabs were significantly more sensitive for detecting ESBL-E than perineal swabs. our data suggested that they are significantly less sensitive for detecting ESBL-E, detecting only around one-half of carriers. this has clear implications for the detection of other resistant Enterobacteriaceae, mostnotably. at least 22 pathogens/pathogen groups with HCAI/HCAO potential have emerged over the past 40 years. novel transmission pathways continue to arise or be recognised. some of these emerging pathogens have resulted in significant challenges (e.g. Clostridium difficile and MRSA) at least 22 pathogens/pathogen groups with HCAI/HCAO potential have emerged over the past 40 years. each new threat results in new national guidance and new pathogen-specific must dos. the sources of information available were the oft-quoted studies that advise that between 1\u201310% of HCAIs present as HCAOs. the sources of information available were the oft-quoted studies that advise that between 1\u201310% of HCAIs present as HCAOs. the primary objective of the survey is to estimate the total burden (prevalence) of HCAI. sources of information available were the oft-quoted studies that advise that between 1\u201310% of HCAIs present as HCAIs. the sources of information available were the oft-quoted studies that advise that between 1\u201310% of HCAIs present as HCAIs. HCAI burden should include both outbreaks and the resources needed to prevent outbreaks. the accepted inference that surveillance programmes should focus on endemic and not epidemic infections (outbreaks) is therefore called into question. SSI surveillance data can be collected using ICNet, with data then transferred to SSIRS. this prevents the need for manually entering data onto two systems, thus freeing up valuable resources which can be utilised in other areas. SSIRS was then configured to accept ICNet-imported files. SSI surveillance data can be collected using ICNet, with data then transferred to SSIRS. this prevents the need for manually entering data onto two systems. a recent audit showed overall compliance was at 85.9%. Moment 3 was observed to have compliance at 95%. this is not necessarily indicative of the absolute infection risk in this hospital environment. a study was conducted to investigate suspected cross-infection of the third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Providencia stuartii (P. stuartii) among different nursing homes. the study was conducted to investigate suspected cross-infection of the third-generation cephalosporin-resistant P. stuartii. four isolates of P. stuartii were resistant to cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, gentamicin and levofloxacin. three isolates were intermediately susceptible to imipenem. PFGE patterns revealed that these four isolates were similar strains. all four isolates of P. stuartii were resistant to cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, gentamicin and levofloxacin. three isolates were intermediately susceptible to imipenem. PFGE was used for genotyping, and the results were interpreted as the same (no band difference), similar ( 3-band differences), or different ( 4-band differences) strains. all three isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. three strains of ceftazidime-resistant Haemophilus parainfluenzae (H. parainfluenzae) were isolated from different hospital patients (HP1, HP2 and HP3) because these isolates were rare, a study was conducted to detect an outbreak. this event was only a cluster of ceftazidime-resistant H. parainfluenzae infections, rather than an outbreak. however, we suggest that laboratory investigation should be done to detect an outbreak, once some unusual antibiotic-resistant organisms increase suddenly. there was no clear linkage between the presence of a microbiology sample, regardless of the result or organism isolated, and the presence of a SSI in colorectal surgery. there was no clear linkage between the presence of a microbiology sample, regardless of the result or organism isolated. there was no clear linkage between the presence of a microbiology sample and the presence of a SSI in colorectal surgery. there was no clear linkage between the presence of a microbiology sample and the presence of a SSI in colorectal surgery. 17 isolates from patients with a median age of 65 years and a male predominance of 1.8:1 were nosocomial with a 15-day median time to positive culture. Surgical specialties submitted the most isolates (41%), with blood being the most common specimen (59%). all isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, but universally susceptible to chloramphenicol and linezolid. clinically significant isolates of E. faecium were cultured from any sterile site sample between September 2014 and February 2015. PFGE typing suggested there were predominant strains of genetically similar E. faecium recovered from across the Trust. acute Trust Lilian Chiwera, William Newsholme and Neil Wigglesworth Guys and Saint Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust continues as previously reported. a surveillance team continues to coordinate data collection, using established local protocols. a reduction from 8.3 to 3.9% in 1 year has already been demonstrated. Conclusions We continued clinical ownership and operational efficiency through the ICNet NG data management system, as well as expanded electronic wound documentation. commenced prospective surveillance in 2014, has already demonstrated a reduction from 8.3 to 3.9% in 1 year. Conclusions We continued clinical ownership and operational efficiency through the ICNet NG data management system. a multidisciplinary collaborative approach was adopted to ensure the best evidence-based practice for all patients. electronic wound documentation was piloted and successfully implemented within the directorate, which has a strong SSIS leadership. EMRSA-15 (ST22-IV) is a global cause of community-acquired infections. in the u.s., the majority of reported PVL-MRSA cases have been community associated. the outbreak occurred on a urology ward of a large teaching hospital. an index case admitted to the ward carrying this clone developed a bacteraemia with the same clone. this is the first reported PVL-MRSA associated with the Indian sub-continent outbreak in a Urology setting. the study highlights the potential risk of spread of this clone in the healthcare setting. four patients acquired an Indian sub-continent clone of PVL-MRSA (ST 22, spa Type 852) from an index case admitted to the ward carrying this clone. control was established using standard infection control procedures. two patients developed a bacteraemia with the same clone. aim was to describe a simple tool to analyse different types of MDR bacteria. we measured in a diary the prevalence of patients who stayed in the hospital > 24 hours, were colonized or infected by MDR bacteria. main causes of admission are trauma and chronic clinical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot. diary of the prevalence of all colonized patients in the hospital ranges from 8% to 14% (median of 10%) multidrug resistant bacteria are present in almost all hospitals of the world. even in the same hospital, it\u2019s possible to have different types of bacteria according to the units. the main wards colonized/infected patients stay in are the Medical Clinic ward (50% of all patients) and Intensive Care 1 (20% of all patients) the diary of the prevalence of all colonized/infected patients in the hospital ranges from 8% to 14% (median of 10%) retrospective study was conducted using residential postcodes in order to establish the proportion of overseas residents admitted to the Trust from high-prevalence areas. results Our study identified 2500 overseas residents admitted during the study period from high-prevalence areas. 500 overseas residents admitted during the study period from high-prevalence areas. the pre-emptive isolation would account for 5% of the Trust\u2019s annual isolation bed days ((2500 x 4 / 342 x 600) * 100) cases were characterised by diversity in terms of the organism: 64% Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae); 15% Escherichia coli; by carbapenemase genes: 55% NDM, 44% OXA-48, 4% VIM and 2% KPC; and by sample type: 36% from screening samples and 60% from clinical samples. a cluster of 29 NDM-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was identified in the latter months of the study, in early 2015. the trust has implemented enhanced surveillance of high-risk wards. there were an additional 31 single rooms without the en-suite facilities. all three hospital sites also have \u2018Private Patient\u2019 units. all three hospitals also have \u2018Private Patient\u2019 units. the surveillance of invasive infections is now mandatory in the uk. a detailed dataset can be used to identify potential lapses in care. a detailed review of BSI cases has provided valuable data on the likely source of a BSI. the likely source data is useful in identifying problems, particularly around documentation of vascular access devices and blood culture collection. a detailed review of BSI cases has provided valuable data on the likely source of a BSI. the likely source data is useful in identifying problems, particularly around documentation of vascular access devices and blood culture collection. in the second fluorescent mark audit 1 week later, we found that of 47 marked sites, 34 (72.3%) were not removed at all, four (8.5%) were partially removed and 13 (27.7%) were removed completely. there was no significant difference between the rate of mark removal in the first and second audits. of 47 marked sites, 34 (72.3%) were not removed at all. four (8.5%) were partially removed and 13 (27.7%) were removed completely. there was no significant difference between the rate of mark removal in the first and second audits. in two cases, ribotyping was pending external review due to a difficulty in culturing. there was a potential lapse in care in eight patients. a total of 14 cases were identified as possible transmission. ribotyping was pending external review due to a difficulty in culturing. of the remaining five cases, similar ribotyping was found. there was a potential lapse in care in eight patients. rectal and perineal swabs were cultured on chromogenic media for ESBL-E. ESBL-E detection rates were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test. perineal swabs are less invasive than rectal swabs, so they are preferable in terms of staff and patient acceptability. we compared the sensitivity of rectal and perineal swabs for detecting ESBL-E. a cluster of Magnusiomyces capitatus cases on a haematology inpatient unit led to an investigation to identify the source and prevent further cases. despite considerable infection prevention and control investigative prowess, we were unable to identify a source or a cause. a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the gender differences on knowledge, attitude and practices of hand hygiene among Saudi nursing students. a total of 209 students participated in the study. electronic hand hygiene monitoring and prompt system was implemented in two inpatient hospitals. sensors on badges and in the environment record entry to and exit from a patient zone. the badge produces a visual and audible alarm to remind practitioners when a hand hygiene opportunity is required. review was to investigate the methods currently available to prevent the spread of infection by MERS-CoV in hospitals. the work will detail effective measures to protect individuals and communities against MERS-CoV. the patient group of spinal patients are identified as having higher infection rates. the group of spinal patients was screened for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) all intravenous (IV) needle-free access devices are required to be disinfected before every access. current UK guidelines recommend \u201cScrubbing the Hub\u201d for a minimum of 15 seconds and then leaving the disinfectant to dry (30 seconds is recommended) the introduction of passive disinfection devices have shown significantly improved clinical outcomes. 13 out of 16 employees develop gastroenteritis after travelling to Morocco for touristic purposes in October 2014. faecal sampling and work restrictions were recommended for all symptomatic employees. the presumed source of this multi-pathogen outbreak of gastroenteritis was in Morocco. no secondary cases were reported in Norway. we concluded our infection control measures were successful. 64% of patients diagnosed with CDI continued to have C. difficile hand carriage 96 hours after resolution of diarrhoea. this group of patients could potentially contribute to onward transmission of C. difficile in the clinical area. the need for extended isolation following resolution of symptoms is to be considered. the infection Prevention Team sampled the six curtains twice a week using an agar plate to perform the \u2018sweep\u2019 technique and swab a predetermined area of the curtain edge. a lack of documentation is associated with fragmented care. a quality improvement plan to do, study and act (QI PDSA) project to improve documentation compliance. we used a quantitative, quasi experimental approach. the study took place at an 843-bed multi-site acute London NHS Trust. the trust had six meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 34 Meticillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus hospital-associated bacteraemia cases. the leading root causes were intravenous (IV) line-related and from contaminated blood cultures. this led to the Trust appointing an IV nurse to look at improving line care and reduce bacteraemia. mucor mycosis is a mucoraceous mold that survives in the environment in soil and buildings. it causes severe infections of the lungs, skin, brain or sinuses in the immunocompromised. the IPCT were keen to honour excellence, and formulated the new year\u2019s honours awards. the awards represent key aspects of infection prevention practice/standards. staff felt positive about them, pleased their hard work was recognised. Intensive Care Unit patients have been screened weekly for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) in 2012, six patients were identified with vancomycin and linezolid-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) in 2013, six patients were identified with vancomycin and linezolid-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) Isolation capacity is a valuable resource in all acute organisations. ward staff would submit side room plans to the IPC team by 08:00 in the morning. red, Amber and Green would rate the side rooms. the ward had previously been cleaned and samples were taken from five bays and six side rooms, from 13 locations. the ward had previously been cleaned and samples were cultured at 37\u00b0 for 24 hours. a previously patient-occupied side room showed TVCs of 34.2, 31.8 and 0 for before cleaning, after cleaning and after Uvo treatment. a previously patient-occupied side room showed TVCs of 34.2, 31.8 and 0 for before cleaning, after cleaning and after Uvo treatment. two wards in four UK national health service hospitals fitted with GOJO SMARTLINKTM. results were compared to self-audit and the \u201cSecret Shopper\u201d audits. highest reported figures were those provided to the Trust Management. results were significantly lower, typically at 5\u201325%. there is clear evidence that phones/tablets can become contaminated with pathogens, which may survive for prolonged periods before being transferred onto hands or other surfaces. a Freedom of Information request for, \u201call current policies or guidelines that make reference to the use and management of mobile phones and tablets in the healthcare environment, by staff, service users and visitors\u201d was sent to national health service institutions across England, Scotland and Wales. the infection and prevention control team recruited student nurses via the university to undertake the prevalence audits using the standard Trust hand hygiene audit tool. students returned the audits and evaluation forms following completion of the audits. Nicola Mousley2 1University Hospitals Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK 2Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, Birmingham UK Background The Trust originally had 13 alert icons to raise awareness of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) or Acinetobacter species. the convoluted system was not well understood by staff and did not include an icon for other alert organisms, such as carbapenemase-producing organisms. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, ranging from simple to life-threatening infections. the hospital practices universal methicillin-resistant S. aureus screening via polymerase chain reaction on admission. methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriage on admission was positively associated with hospital stay > 7 days. prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonisation or infection is the strongest predictor for methicillin-resistant S. aureus nasal carriage on admission. cases were inpatients with positive influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. controls were inpatients with negative tests. two-thirds of influenza patients were aged > 65 years. patients presenting with general symptoms and unspecified infectious diseases should be actively tested for influenza and pre-emptive isolation considered, particularly when approaching influenza season. the new year's honours awards represent a number of key aspects of infection prevention and control (IPC) improvement. the winning ward/s had to achieve 85% compliance throughout the year. the award winners were published and certificates presented publically. staff to think about infection prevention practices, encouraged discussion and raised morale. Declaration of conflicting interest No conflicts of interest to declare. audit undertaken in a neurosurgical department. a retrospective study in a cohort of patients attending for intra-dural procedures between 24 November 2014 and 17 January 2015. results We had 79% of patients who met the intra-dural procedure criteria who had a completed assessment. of those, 83% and 56% had an assessment completed, respectively. outbreak wards had to implement several measures in a short time. different screening strategies were applied to detect patients colonized with VRE. patients transferred to other healthcare institutions were screened prior to departure. streamlined and provided more enhanced reporting, freeing up time for the infection control doctor to concentrate on microbiology and/or infection control-related clinical issues. creating scientific evidence-based interventions to prevent infections, such as re-invigorating how safety Thermometer data for CAUTIs is utilised by staff to reduce these infections. plan was to centralise patient documentation onto the Trust\u2019s electronic record system. it was designed to enable all relevant clinical personnel access to written individual patient advice in real time. a consultation with the legal department resulted in assurances that the electronic record system would fulfil the Trust\u2019s legal requirements. the outbreak was compared to a previous incident in the same hospital, in 2010. 78 hospital and 19 community-acquired cases of norovirus were reported across the hospital between 24 February and 26 April 2015. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an opportunistic organism that has been associated with outbreaks in critical care areas due to contamination of the water supply. trusts are required to test water samples from taps in augmented care areas and to take remedial action if samples are positive. a cluster of Magnusiomyces capitatus cases on a haematology inpatient unit led to an investigation to identify the source and prevent further cases. results despite considerable infection prevention and control investigative prowess, the investigation did lead to improvements in many practices. many practices were identified that had to be changed, including milkshake rounds undertaken by volunteers. a cluster of Magnusiomyces capitatus cases on a haematology inpatient unit led to an investigation to identify the source and prevent further cases. despite considerable infection prevention and control investigative prowess, we were unable to identify a source or a cause for this cluster of cases. ward, staff and multidisciplinary team became acutely aware of the importance cleanliness of the ward and the management of patient foodstuffs. no further cases have been identified. a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the gender differences on knowledge, attitude and practices of hand hygiene and the performance of the \u201c5 moments of hand hygiene\u201d among Saudi nursing students. a total of 209 students participated in the study. the gold standard for measuring hand hygiene (HH) compliance is direct observation; however, this is resource-intensive and leads to artificially inflated results, due to the Hawthorne effect. recently, electronically-assisted HH monitoring systems have been developed to support hand hygiene monitoring and feedback, to help improve compliance. electronic hand hygiene monitoring and prompt system was implemented in two inpatient hospital units. sensors on badges and in the environment record entry to and exit from a patient zone, along with HH events. the badge produces a visual and audible alarm to remind practitioners when a hand hygiene opportunity is required. this project will present the most effective strategies to monitor and manage the disease in both the short and long term. the work will detail effective measures to protect individuals and communities against MERS-CoV. four main themes emerged: Clinical manifestation, prevention and treatment, breaking the chain of infection, and the risk factors of MERS-CoV. the risk to healthcare workers was examined, including the impact of their behaviour on the efficacy of early diagnosis in reducing and controlling the spread of the virus. the staff marked records for patients to whom they provided the PGD. the categories of patients who did not receive the PGD/decolonisation included hips, knees, shoulders, foot and ankle, and a spinal patient who did not attend the POA clinic. there was a post-implementation audit of the S. aureus PGD, from June to December 2014. the staff marked records for patients to whom they provided the PGD. the categories of patients who did not receive the PGD/decolonisation included hips, knees, shoulders, foot and ankle, and a spinal patient who did not attend the POA clinic. the introduction of passive disinfection devices has shown significantly improved clinical outcomes. the purpose of this study was to compare compliance versus incidence of line-related bacteremias. the introduction of passive disinfection devices has shown significantly improved clinical outcomes. the purpose of this study was to compare compliance versus incidence of line-related bacteremias. a total of 1074 patients from 7 April 2014 to 6 October 2014 had their needle-free devices cleaned with a \u2018Curos\u2019 passive device. 13 out of 16 employees develop gastroenteritis after travelling to Morocco for touristic purposes in October 2014. all staff was reminded of hand hygiene procedures and the importance of reporting any new cases of gastroenteritis among patients or personnel. 13 out of 16 employees develop gastroenteritis after travelling to Morocco for touristic purposes in October 2014. staff were reminded of hand hygiene procedures and the importance of reporting any new cases of gastroenteritis among patients or personnel. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-associated diarrhoea is the most common type of healthcare-acquired diarrhoea and its reduction is a top priority for the National Health Services. there is consensus that early detection and isolation of patients with C. difficile infection (CDI) is effective in reducing potential transmission. isolation ceased after resolution of diarrhoea. this area requires further investigation over an extended study period. any future study would also need to consider ribotyping of all study samples, to enable identification showing that the type of C. difficile in participants\u2019 stools matches their hand carriage. the need for extended isolation following resolution of symptoms is to be considered. any future study would also need to consider ribotyping of all study samples to enable identification showing that the type of C. difficile in participants\u2019 stools matches their hand carriage. the growth rate for the hospital curtain was 13.46 colonies more than that for the treated curtain (p = 0.001). the growth detected from samples significantly increased over time (p = 0.001). the infection Prevention Team sampled the six curtains twice a week using an agar plate to perform the \u2018sweep\u2019 technique and swab a predetermined area of the curtain edge. all colony types were counted and identified using traditional laboratory methods. we obtained 180 samples over 8 weeks. quality improvement plan to do, study and act (QI PDSA) project. used quantitative, quasi experimental approach, with a pre- and post-intervention study design. the post-infection review process highlights poor documentation on invasive device insertion and care. there is evidence that evidence-based care bundles were not being adhered to. it is known that a lack of documentation is associated with fragmented care. a standardised documentation record that uses checklists and incorporates evidence-based practice has improved documentation compliance and assisted with information flow amongst clinicians. despite improvement, further progress is still required and future studies are planned. the trust had six meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 34 Meticillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus hospital-associated bacteraemia cases. the leading root causes were intravenous (IV) line-related and from contaminated blood cultures, this led to the Trust appointing an IV nurse to look at improving line care and reduce bacteraemia. we plan to expand the ICT to be more proactive, by reviewing more patients and carrying out more training of clinical staff. as the IV line care was reduced as a root cause, surgical wounds have emerged as an issue. no further cases of mucoraceous mold infections have been identified at the Trust. the systems and processes have been improved, and both patients have made a recovery following their procedures. both patients have made a recovery following their procedures. Declaration of conflicting interest No conflicts of interest to declare. the IPCT were keen to honour excellence, and formulated the new year\u2019s Honours Awards. wards that win have to achieve 85% compliance throughout the year. progress in C. difficile Prevention award has to reduce the number of ward-acquired infections to zero. in 2013, six patients were identified with vancomycin and linezolid-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) in 2013, six patients were identified with vancomycin and linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE), which was typed as CAMPBEC-11. environmental cleaning and effective hand hygiene practices were heightened. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients have been screened weekly for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) in 2012, six patients were identified with vancomycin and linezolid-resistant enterococci (CAMPBEC-11) Isolation capacity is a valuable resource in all acute organisations. the aim of this project was to release inappropriately-used side rooms. ward staff would submit side room plans to the IPC team by 08:00 in the morning. declaration of conflicting interest No conflicts of interest to declare. Background Isolation capacity is a valuable resource in all acute organisations. the aim of this project was to release inappropriately-used side rooms. 3757 UvoTM decontamination following new ward-building project. ward was previously cleaned and samples were taken from five bays and six side rooms. after-cleaning results from the refurbished environment cultured up to 43.5 colonies on average (handrail) after the Uvo decontamination, these were consistently reduced (0\u20132.1 range) a previously patient-occupied side room showed TVCs of 34.2, 31.8 and 0 for before cleaning, after cleaning and after Uvo treatment. samples cultured at 37\u00b0 for 24 hours, and then colonies were counted. after-cleaning results from the refurbished environment cultured up to 43.5 colonies on average. GOJO SMARTLINKTM, an automatic electronic hand hygiene compliance monitoring system, provides complementary results. results were compared to self-audit and the \u201cSecret Shopper\u201d audits. results were significantly lower, typically at 5\u201325%. the only thing an audit result can claim is that at the time of the measurement, the compliance rate was \u201cX\u201d.1 in the UK, compliance rates > 90% are widely reported, leading the government and hospital management to believe that hand hygiene is under control. mobile devices have become an essential aspect of their daily life. there is clear evidence that phones/tablets can become contaminated with pathogens, which may survive for prolonged periods before being transferred onto hands. the literature in this field calls for clear, evidence-based guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting of mobile devices. the department of health guidance states that patients should be allowed the widest possible use of mobile phones. a number of hand hygiene audits were carried out each quarter. the average hand hygiene compliance following the audits was 60%. the average hand hygiene compliance following the audits was 60%. compliance with the Trust weekly hand hygiene audits appears to show between 80\u2013100%; however, there is some question about the validity of these audit results. a recommendation would be to have a core group of staff undertake the covert audits. new patient alert icon was designed by the infection prevention nurses. the icon is activated for all alert organisms and can be manually controlled by the infection prevention nurse. fewer patients with MRSA are now inadvertently prescribed flucloxacillin. PICS has the possibility to allow data extraction on a range of measures to drive improvements in infection prevention, such as the time to administration of antibiotics and the notification of deviations from the baseline stool record to prompt for a specimen. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, ranging from simple to life-threatening infections. the hospital practices universal methicillin-resistant S. aureus screening via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on admission. methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriage on admission was positively associated with a hospital stay > 7 days. prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonisation or infection was positively associated with a hospital stay > 7 days. tertiary-care public hospital practices universal methicillin-resistant S. aureus screening via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on admission. our cases were inpatients screened to be methicillin-resistant S. aureus -positive on admission. a total of 46,691 patients were screened upon admission. prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonisation or infection is the strongest predictor for methicillin-resistant S. aureus nasal carriage on admission. the colonisers or infected are 16.5 times as likely to be screened as positive. Pneumonia (ICD-9 480\u2013487) and unspecified infectious diseases (ICD-9 136) contributed to 42% of admitting diagnoses for influenza-positive patients. general symptoms (OR 2.09; 95%CI 1.86\u20132.34; p 0.001), pneumonia (OR 1.29; 95%CI 1.17\u20131.41; p 0.001) and other non-airway respiratory diseases (p 0.001) were positively associated with the influenza infection. the hospital's inpatient population had a median age of 70 years. cases were inpatients with positive influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests; controls were inpatients with negative tests. two-thirds of influenza patients were aged > 65 years. patients admitted to rooms previously colonised with pathogens have a substantially greater risk of cross-transmission if the environment has not been cleaned appropriately. the audit involved a liquid ultraviolet light (UV)-reactive gel applied to high-touch surfaces. poor environmental cleaning can result in surfaces harbouring reservoirs of bacteria invisible to the naked eye. patients admitted to rooms previously colonised with pathogens have a substantially greater risk of cross-transmission if the environment has not been cleaned appropriately. Prevention and Control Teams (IPCTs) strive to improve patient safety. process and outcome performance data is used to support improvement strategies. but it had not been used specifically to congratulate staff on their commitment to infection prevention and control improvement. the IPCT was keen to honour excellence and formulated the new year's Honours Awards. the winning ward/s had to achieve 85% compliance throughout the year. the winning ward/s had to reduce the number of ward-acquired Clostridium difficile infection to zero in 2014. in the hospital, the CJD/vCJD risk assessment is undertaken to reduce the risk of iatrogenic spread of the disease. current methods available for decontamination of instruments are not reliable in the removal of prion proteins (the causative agents of CJD/vCJD) assessment is undertaken in those undergoing medium-to-high-risk surgery. an audit was undertaken in a neurosurgical department to establish compliance to national guidance in relation to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease/Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD/vCJD) risk assessment is undertaken to reduce the risk of iatrogenic spread of the disease. current methods available for decontamination of instruments are not reliable in the removal of prion proteins. in late august 2014, the outbreak included 47 patients. wards in the satellite hospital were declared as \u201coutbreak wards\u201d. the hospital management was dedicated to solving the VRE problem from the start. this support made it easier to implement infection control measures. greater availability and presence of infection control personnel in the wards was needed to assure measures were implemented. clinical scientist was primarily employed to aid the Director of Infection Prevention and Control, and provide enhanced surveillance and innovative research for the IPCT. results The clinical scientist has proved a useful member of the IPCT, providing the scientific and evidence basis needed to reduce healthcare infections in this ever-changing healthcare environment. clinical scientist was primarily employed to aid the Director of Infection Prevention and Control, and provide enhanced surveillance and innovative research for the IPCT. the clinical scientist has provided comprehensive surveillance for HCAIs, enabling a more robust way of identifying clusters and outbreaks, streamlined and enhanced reporting. ella, Pseudomonas and renal water management has developed clinical surveillance pertaining to Pseudomonas in the water supply of augmented care. has worked with public health England experts on important water pathogens, for example, helping develop national water guidelines for Pseudomonas in augmented care settings. provided a link between the medical staff and IPCT by participating in ward rounds and providing Infection Control with advice. the IPCN team require assurances that real-time audit data on meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening results and eradication therapy for MRSA is available. if assurances are given, then it is the recommendation of the IPCN Team that we transfer our data entry prospectively to the electronic record system. the IPCN team require assurances that real-time audit data on meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening results and eradication therapy for MRSA is available. the electronic alert is a robust system to ensure that an up-to-date, real-time notification is attached to the patient\u2019s record. 19 community-acquired cases of norovirus were reported across the hospital, with an outbreak declared following a spike in cases on 2 April 2015. a previous outbreak from 2010 had resulted in complete closure of the hospital. lessons learned from that incident were used to inform action, to reduce any impact. a previous outbreak from 2010 had resulted in complete closure of the hospital. staff in closed wards wearing scrubs, visiting restrictions, route changes to avoid affected wards, changes to virology testing regimes. trusts are required to test water samples from taps in augmented care areas. initial remedial actions proved ineffective; therefore, a systematic approach was adopted to identify the source of the contamination. a systematic approach was adopted to identify the source of the contamination. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an opportunistic organism that has been associated with outbreaks in critical care areas. trusts are required to test water samples from taps in augmented care areas and to take remedial action if samples are positive. initial remedial actions proved ineffective; therefore, a systematic approach was adopted to identify the source of contamination. an infectious group A Streptococcus (IGAS) outbreak was declared in a care home in Birmingham, UK, following two cases in may 2014, a further case in November 2014 and a fourth case in January 2015. a member of the care home staff was admitted to intensive care following a reaction to chicken Pox that was IGAS positive in a wound. the IP team had a visible high-profile presence within the home throughout the outbreak. all staff was re-swabbed, and upon all negative results, the home re-opened in April 2015. a table-top discussion will take place to review the positive and negative aspects encountered. evidence of improvement is still being collected, but results to date will be presented. a key future development of this project will be patient involvement by being informed of the investigation and inviting participation. the website was launched in April 2015, and has received extremely positive feedback, with numerous and repeated orders for resources. the website has received extremely positive feedback, with numerous and repeated orders for resources. the work of the chronic Wounds Project has had a positive impact on the management of chronic wounds across the city. in total, 44% (102) of the wounds healed (95% CI: 37.4% to 50.0%) and 82% (192) of the wounds were either healed or improving (95% CI: 76.6% to 86.4%). there was no formal cost-benefit analysis nor evaluation of the patient experience undertaken. literature review study found community-acquired MRSA is affecting household members of index patients and colonisation of the environment. results highlighted the need to have policies, guidelines and constant structured infection control training in the community. focus groups were established to identify specific learning requirements for community staff. the drop-in sessions were communicated through a variety of networks. the sessions were held over 4 days in may 2015 in a variety of community settings. nationally, 21% of patients do not complete decolonisation programmes. these patients are susceptible to acquiring a MRSA bacteraemia. there is limited research focusing on why patients refuse treatment. four patients reported to have Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus wound infections following dressing changes in a Walk-in Centre (WIC) during January 2015. the general environment was assessed for cleanliness and condition of the d\u00e9cor. hand hygiene audits, equipment, environmental cleaning records and schedules were reviewed. a high rate of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in a local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) population was significantly above the English median and not meeting the national objectives. the majority of cases are diagnosed with specimens collected in the community by general practitioners. contact tracing in tuberculosis (TB) is performed to detect the people with active disease and to detect those infected, but without evidence of disease (latent TB) one person with infectious TB can infect 10 people per year, for 2 years, and one can become infectious. our current process failed to examine in sufficient detail the lifestyle of the Index Case A. we have amended our screening questionnaire accordingly, checking at the beginning and re-checking throughout their treatment. we hope our amended process will identify others who previously may have been missed. a multidisciplinary action plan has been developed to ensure organisational engagement and commitment. Shared learning from BSI investigations were disseminated throughout the organisation. area audited General keep table management Staff health Lounge Dining room Dirty utility Sharp Average score % 66% 25% 69% 75% 75% 78% 78% Results Following the audit, immediate feedback was given. an audit report and action plan with recommendations on all areas that did not meet the expected standard was distributed to the Council and the care home. the IP team believed that the severity of her condition had a huge impact on the rest of the care home staff\u2019s willingness and compliance with throat swabbing. it was established that staff in the care home were very young and needed on-going support throughout the outbreak. staff in the care home were very young and needed on-going support throughout the outbreak. a pilot project has been developed to review all cases of C. difficile identified in primary care practices in a large Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in the uk. results The project aimed to reduce the number of C. difficile cases that have associated lapses in care. also recognising good practice, raising awareness of C. difficile in primary care and keeping the patient experience as a focus. evidence of improvement is still being collected, but results to date will be presented. a key future development of this project will be patient involvement by being informed of the investigation and inviting participation. patient involvement will also encourage clinicians\u2019 commitment to the process. a dynamic national health service (NHS) community Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) team aim to improve IPC standards and reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) it is estimated there are over 300,000 HCAIs in England every year. the website was launched in April 2015, and has received extremely positive feedback. the website has received numerous and repeated orders for resources. the cost has been kept to a minimum, to cover the cost of printing. the work of the chronic Wounds Project has had a positive impact on the management of chronic wounds across the city. in total, 44% (102) of the wounds healed (95% CI: 37.4% to 50.0%) and 82% (192) of the wounds either healed or improving (95% CI: 76.6% to 86.4%). there was no formal cost-benefit analysis nor evaluation of the patient experience undertaken. we would get a 30% reduction in the number of chronic wounds identified in a baseline audit across the city. initial cohorts of patients were assessed and their management supported by the Chronic Wounds Team (CWT) further patients with chronic wounds were referred to the CWT from areas such as adult community nursing, general practitioner (GP) practice nurses, foot health and nursing homes. a literature review study was carried out, to seek to understand meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in the community. the results highlighted the need to have policies, guidelines and constant structured infection control training in the community. a total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the literature review study. a total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the literature review study. results highlighted the need to have policies, guidelines and constant structured infection control training. focus groups were established to identify specific learning requirements for community staff, the most convenient settings and times at which community staff could access. the drop-in sessions were communicated through a variety of networks; for example: district nurse managers, health visitors, Community Health Partnerships, and including general practitioners. the drop-in sessions were held over 4 days in a variety of community settings. present at each stand was representation from the IPCT, Education, Wound Management, catheter associated urinary tract infection, and Sharp Safety and Procurement. on leaving, they were encouraged to complete a short evaluation. non-adherence to treatment for patients with MRSA is a major concern in primary care. non-adherence with correct application of decolonisation treatment is a major problem in primary care. there is limited research focusing on why patients are refusing treatment, not completing treatment or remaining colonised with MRSA. there is limited research focusing on why patients do not complete treatment, remain colonised or refuse treatment. four patients reported to have Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) wound infections following dressing changes in a Walk-in Centre during January 2015. the general environment was assessed for cleanliness and condition of the d\u00e9cor. hand hygiene audits, equipment, environmental cleaning records and schedules were reviewed. four patients reported to have Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) wound infections following dressing changes in a Walk-in Centre during January 2015. the general environment was assessed for cleanliness and condition of the d\u00e9cor. a high rate of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in a local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) population was significantly above the English median and not meeting the national objectives. the majority of cases are diagnosed with specimens collected in the community. we reviewed 76% of community CDI as significant events, from September 2014 to April 2015. the CCG annual CDI objective was met for 2014/2015. Conclusions We plan to implement the recommendations identified for further reduction of CDI towards the English median rate. the GP completes a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for each patient diagnosed with CDI. we reviewed 76% of community CDI as significant events, from September 2014 to April 2015. if he had been, was confirmed as having been exposed to and treated for latent TB, he may not have developed active disease and infected others. our current process failed to examine in sufficient detail the lifestyle of the Index Case A, as it may have revealed places of close contact other than domestic. our current process failed to examine in sufficient detail the lifestyle of the Index Case A. we have amended our screening questionnaire accordingly, checking at the beginning and re-checking throughout their treatment, and opportunistically screening those who may have been missed. a multidisciplinary action plan has been developed to ensure organisational engagement and commitment. shared learning from BSI investigations were disseminated throughout the organisation. targeted training, review of BSI investigation documentation and a review of early sepsis recognition toolkits have been implemented. a multidisciplinary action plan has been developed to ensure organisational engagement and commitment.

handpieces between patients, and nine (12.2%) now use sterilization bags, instead of leaving them unpackaged. untreated lines showed confluent growth via SEM and a stable TVC of approximately 105 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. no viable organisms were recovered from the treated or prevention lines. -quantitative (scanning electron microscopy) and quantitative (total viable counts (TVCs) methods to determine biofilm removal and prevention against single-species P. aeruginosa (ATCC 700888) biofilms were grown at room temperature for 4 weeks, establishing confluent growth. 121 patients with a fractured neck of femur and hypothermia were treated. a departmental audit on hypothermia was designed to investigate further. data on body temperature was collected upon admission. on-table, 18% of patients were hypothermic. there was at least one episode of hypothermia in 67% of patients in the first 24 hours following admission. hypothermia is also a significant risk factor for fractured neck of femur-related surgical site infections (SSIs) there were eight knee infections contributing to the 10% infection rate. six patients (5.9%) were infected in the hip group. inpatient and re-admission SSI patients treated with further surgery. surgery was carried out for 3 months, after which time 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol was introduced for pre-operative skin cleansing. only one patient out of a total of 115 (0.9%) developed a SSI within 30 days of the original surgery. a detailed review of peri-operative practices was carried out, through direct observation and discussion with staff, to identify areas for improvement. shortcomings were identified, including: Performing emergency hemi-arthroplasties in a conventionally-ventilated operating room (OR), poor antibiotic choice and timing, damaged instrument packaging, frequent OR door openings. we report on high post-operative infection rates in patients with a fractured neck of femur and hypothermia. the results suggest that hypothermia is also a significant risk factor for fractured neck of femur-related surgical site infections. we report on high post-operative infection rates in patients with a fractured neck of femur and hypothermia. the ASA scores showed that 26% of patients were ASA Grade 2, 62.4% were ASA Grade 3 and 11.6% were ASA Grade 4. a is also a significant risk factor for fractured neck of femur-related surgical site infections (SSIs) a post-operative infection of total hip or total knee replacement can be catastrophic. four patients had positive cultures (one meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) one Pseudomonas and two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) the most noticeable change was the frequent breach of ring fencing and \u201chot bedding\u201d of joint replacement patients. six patients (5.9%) were infected in the hip group (two inpatient, one re-admission and three patient-reported SSIs) patients were treated with further surgery (six washouts, three Manipulations under anaesthesia and two revisions) and at least 6 weeks of antibiotics, with frequent blood tests. only one patient out of a total of 115 (0.9%) developed a SSI within 30 days of the original surgery. a change from iodine to 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine has been implemented in surgical specialities throughout the Trust. only one patient out of 115 (0.9%) developed a SSI within 30 days of the original surgery. a change from iodine to 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine has been implemented in surgical specialities throughout the Trust and further SSI surveillance is being undertaken. the results of observations were presented to senior hospital management, orthopaedic surgeons and nurses. a comprehensive action plan was implemented, with a focus

respiratory/influenza illness were reported to the IPCT. each home was risk assessed on an individual basis by the IPCT. GPs supported by the IPCT and PHE in the prescribing of anti-viral prophylaxis and/or therapy for affected residents. despite many challenges, Ebola preparedness in Scotland has been considered successful in that: a specification of PPE to be used was produced (and updated); Training in PPE usage was made accessible to all; and Sufficient PPE was procured for all NHS Boards. the national cleaning standard audits focused on the maintenance and cleanliness of the patient environment and equipment. additional resources were implemented to improve standards, including a ward refurbishment programme and nursing orderlies. methods health protection Scotland established contact with key informants involved in fit testing at each board. key informants from 11 out of 15 boards responded to a survey designed to gather information on current fit testing arrangements. in parallel, HPS explored options for alternative models of providing fit testing. TIDU and infection control have managed potential EVD and other haemorrhagic fever patients based on national guidelines. there was no experience for developing or using centres to manage patients outside of the Trexler facility in London. a multi-disciplinary team developed and was steered by Infectious Diseases/Infection Control. health boards in NHS Scotland purchase all of their ABHR through the NHS National Procurement (NP) distribution centre, allowing the volume purchased by each board to be quantified. results This collaborative work between three NHS Scotland organisations has resulted in a \u201cdashboard\u201d that visually displays the data on the health boards\u2019 ABHR consumption. a recent Sri Lankan study reveals a candidaemia incidence of 2.3 per 100,000 in the population. we analysed automated and manual blood cultures that were positive for Candida from April 2014 to February 2015. the majority were male (42/62; 68%) VC insertion and maintenance, and avoidance of broad-spectrum antibiotics, could play a major role in prevention of nosocomial candidaemia. a high grade of suspicion is important to detect candidaemia early and to start antifungals, as there is clinical deterioration of the patients with risk factors. minor employees and other categories were 25 (24%), 13 (12%) and 23 (22%), respectively. cut injuries during surgery, capillary blood sugar testing and blood drawing caused EI to 20 HCWs. only 74 (70%) were fully vaccinated against HBV. post-exposure HBV vaccine was given to 31 (29%) HCWs. study aimed at determining efficacious dose of TMP/SXZ against S. maltophilia. results Of the 504 patients initially enrolled in the study, only 209 adult patients fit the inclusion criteria. trust guidelines for splenectomy include pre-operative vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics and a rescue pack prescription post-operatively, patient advice and a booster vaccination at 1 month. patients that underwent total or partial splenectomy from January 2011 to December 2014 were identified through review of theatre logbooks. only 8% (4/49) of the elective cases were vaccinated pre-operatively and 76% (45/59) of the patients discharged had either the first set of vaccinations or a the national health service (NHS) Scotland\u2019s national infection prevention and control manual (NIPCM) is mandatory guidance for employees in all NHS healthcare settings. there was a risk that unless access to the manual was improved, unsuitable information and practices could be utilised. the new Scottish UTI Network will utilise established links from organisations and specialists out to the clinical or care \u201cfront line\u201d. the new Scottish UTI Network will utilise established methods of communication that reach all stakeholders and when all resources related to UTI reduction are easily accessible to all. health protection Scotland (HPS) were tasked with coordinating the sharing of these resources and to develop a community that is intent on seeing UTI reduction across Scotland. the aim was to see a reduction in the number of UTIs across Scotland, and to achieve this we will coordinate the communication of all resources available to reduce UTIs. poster will detail an outbreak of respiratory and influenza illness that affected care homes across the Health Economy of Western Cheshire, between December 2014 and March 2015. it will outline the outbreak response from the Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT) and demonstrate partnership working across the Health Economy. the poster will outline areas of good practice, in addition to identifying areas of development that will be addressed prior to the next seasonal influenza season. there was a significant increase in respiratory/influenza illness reported to the IPCT. each home was risk assessed on an individual basis by the IPCT. GPs supported by the IPCT and PHE in the prescribing of anti-viral prophylaxis and/or therapy. the production of guidance in this way can lead to inconsistencies between the protocols of different agencies or organisations. to ensure that the guidance was up to date and aligned to that of other public health organisations, it was necessary to keep pace with a rapidly increasing volume of guidelines. despite many challenges, Ebola preparedness in Scotland has been considered successful in that: a specification of PPE to be used was produced (and updated), Training in PPE usage was made accessible to all; and Sufficient PPE was procured for all NHS Boards. the national cleaning standard audits focused on the maintenance and cleanliness of the patient environment and equipment. additional resources were implemented to improve standards, including a ward refurbishment programme and nursing orderlies. the main focus was low scores from the audits. additional resources were implemented to improve standards, including a ward refurbishment programme and nursing orderlies. there is debate about cases considered lapse in care not always being clinically avoidable. but by reducing the lapse in care, we should see a reduction in CDI cases in the forthcoming year. in parallel, HPS explored options for alternative models of providing fit testing. included the use of third-party providers and quantitative fit testing, and the acceptability of a proposed tiered risk-based approach. if implemented, this would significantly ease the burden on health boards. results HPS has built relationships with key informants in the majority of boards, for on-going and future collaborative work. there is now a better understanding of current fit testing practices. there is support among health boards for the proposed risk-based approach. a multi-disciplinary team developed and was steered by Infectious Diseases/Infection Control. it consisted of multiple in-house specialties, together with external agencies. a fundamental component was the development, sourcing and adaptation of new enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and training of staff to use it safely. a multi-disciplinary team developed and was steered by Infectious Diseases/Infection Control. it consisted of multiple in-house specialties, together with external agencies. we developed robust pathways for infrastructure and building adaptations, transfer and isolation of patients, clear communication pathways and a safe and sustainable programme of rotas for nursing/medical staff. method The majority of health boards in NHS Scotland purchase all of their ABHR through the NHS National Procurement (NP) distribution centre. using an estimated measure of 3 ml per ABHR usage, we combined this data with admission data held by the Information Services Division (ISD) the dashboard will be shared with individual boards to provide them with information and feedback on hand hygiene compliance based on the proxy measure. we combined this data with admission data held by the Information Services Division (ISD) and allowed calculation of the mean number of ABHR hand hygiene uses per admission per day, for each board. results This collaborative work between three NHS Scotland organisations has resulted in the development of a \u201cdashboard\u201d that visually displays the data on the health boards\u2019 ABHR consumption. patients age ranged from 3 days to 80 years, with 37 (60%) adults and 11(18%) neonates. we had 49 patients (79%) with an intensive care unit (ICU) admission prior to the positive blood culture. 44 patients (71%) had a central venous catheter (CVC) inserted. tiary care hospital in a southern province of Sri Lanka had 62 patients with Candida-positive blood cultures. the majority were male (42/62; 68%). patient age ranged from 3 days to 80 years. 105 reported cases of EI during 2014 among our hospital\u2019s HCWs. nurses reported the highest number of incidents (44/105; 42%). most incidents were following an incorrect sharps discard (n = 36; 34%). post-exposure HBV vaccine was given to 31 (29%) HCWs and PEP for HIV was started in eight HCWs. 105 reported cases of EI during 2014 among our hospital\u2019s HCWs. only 74 (70%) were fully vaccinated against HBV. 10 (9%) were never vaccinated, while 44 (42%) had checked their HBV antibody status. post-exposure HBV vaccine was given to 31 (29%) HCWs. the study compared the clinical and microbiological outcomes of patients on three dose ranges of TMP/SXZ against S. maltophilia. results Of the 504 patients initially enrolled in the study, only 209 adult patients fit the inclusion criteria. there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the three groups except renal failure. retrospective study was conducted at King Faisal Specialist Hospital (KFSH and RC), from 2010 to 2013. the study compared the clinical and microbiological outcomes of patients on three dose ranges of TMP/SXZ against S. maltophilia. trust guidelines for splenectomy include: pre-operative vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics and a rescue pack prescription post-operatively, patient advice and a booster vaccination at 1 month. only 8% (4/49) of the elective cases were vaccinated pre-operatively and 76% (45/59) of the patients discharged had either the first set of vaccinations or a documented plan for vaccination. spleenectomy is not uncommon in a regional centre for hepatobiliary and pancreatobiliary surgery. an absent or dysfunctional spleen puts patients at a high risk of potentially life-threatening infections. trust guidelines include pre-operative vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics and a rescue pack prescription post-operatively. the national health service (NHS) Scotland\u2019s national infection prevention and control manual (NIPCM) is mandatory guidance for employees in all NHS healthcare settings. it covers standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission-based precautions (TBPs), and is based on current scientific evidence. the entire content of the website, including appendices, will be developed to ensure compatibility and accessibility on mobile devices. real-time feedback from users of the website will be encouraged, to make sure the website is current."}
