{"summary": "diabetes is a chronic metabolic syndrome caused by insulin deficiency and resistance. there are 200 million diabetic individuals in the world, with only approximately one-half being diagnosed. the disease often results in long-term microvascular, neurological, and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy. ACE2 knockout mice exhibit progressive impairments in glucose tolerance and reduced first-phase insulin secretion (14). ang (1-7) is hypothesized to exhibit antioxidant effects in diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and in the brain (16\u201319). l bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin (both from Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Technology, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 10 mmol/l HEPES, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate and 50 mol/l mercaptoethanol, in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. INS-1 cells were grown for 48 h and then incubated in 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose KRBB, respectively, at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. INS-1 cells were then incubated in the presence of either 108 mol/l Ang (1-7) (Sigma-Aldrich), 106 mol/l A779 (Sigma-Aldrich) or Ang (1-7) and A779 together, for 2 h. cells were loaded with 5 mol/l dihydroethidium (DHE) ROS (Vigorous Biotechnology Co., Ltd.; Beijing, China) detection and suspended in PBS for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. after centrifugation at 140 g for 5 min, pellets were resuspended in 500 l PBS. color change from green to red indicated an increase in the MMP or the improvement of mitochondrial function. one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's or Dunnett's tests were used to compare all groups or selected groups to the control. INS-1 cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner following H2O2 stimulation. oxidative stress was induced by treatment with 250 M H2O2. INS-1 cells were grown for 2 days in 96-well plates. INS-1 cells were loaded with 5 mol/l fluo-3AM (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) in a 40-min incubation at 37\u00b0C in 3.3 mmol/l KRBB following pretreatment with Ang (1-7) or A779 for 2 h. in the last 15 min, H2O2 was added at a 250-M concentration. em >590\u2013610 nm was determined using an ex wavelength of 480\u2013535 nm. cells were divided into two subgroups: ROS-negative cells. cells were incubated with 1 ml JC-1 (2 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Ang (1-7) restored GSIS in the presence of H2O2 Groups treated with H2O2 exhibited significantly impaired insulin secretion (51.8%) compared with the control groups. ang (1-7), angiotensin (1-7); GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; OD, optical density. treatment with 108 mol/l for 2 h selectively inhibited this effect. effect of Ang (1-7) and A779 (106 mol/l) on the glucose (16.7 mmol/l)-stimulated insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of H2O2. pre-incubation with Ang (1-7) restored the amplitude of calcium in phase 1. Ang (1-7) restored glucose-stimulated calcium in the presence of H2O2. treatment with 108 mol/l Ang (1-7) for 2 h prior to adding H2O2 upregulates calcium fluorescence by 25%. treatment with 108 mol/l Ang (1-7) for 2 h increased the level of MMP. Ang (1-7) restored the MMP in the presence of H2O2. the staining was quantified and presented as a graph. Ang (1-7) restored GSIS in the presence of H2O2 Groups treated with H2O2 exhibited significantly impaired insulin secretion (51.8%) compared with the control groups. ang (1-7), angiotensin (1-7); GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; OD, optical density. h A779 selectively inhibited this effect. effect of Ang (1-7) and A779 on the generation of ROS stimulated by H2O2. ang (1-7), angiotensin (1-7); ROS, reactive oxygen species. pre-incubation with Ang (1-7) restored the amplitude of calcium in phase 1. Ang (1-7) restored the amplitude of calcium in the presence of H2O2. treatment with A779 (108 mol/l for 2 h) can selectively inhibit this effect. Ang (1-7) restored the MMP in the presence of H2O2. the staining was quantified and presented as a graph. Ang (1-7) reversed the decreases in the MMP induced by H2O2 (15 min at 250 M H2O2). this is the first study to confirm the antioxidant effect of Ang (1-7) in INS-1 cells. a certain level of ROS is required for glucose homeostasis (22) but excess ROS leads to cell dysfunction by promoting cell apoptosis. chronic injection of Ang (1-7) improves insulin sensitivity in rats with a high-fructose diet (24), Mas receptor knockout mice exhibited decreased insulin sensitivity, impaired glucose tolerance and glucose uptake (25). these studies demonstrated the protective role of Ang (1-7) occurs by reducing oxidative stress. the importance of mitochondria in type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated by the identification of causal mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in pancreatic cells. excessive AngII can increase mitochondrial ROS production, and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory control ratio (21). Ang (1-7) in the early stages of diabetes. these findings may assist with the treatment in future."}
