{"summary": "gene therapy is the use of nucleic acids to repair, replace, or regulate genes to prevent or treat disease. some notable examples include replacement of the mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator with a functional copy to treat cystic fibrosis [2], the knockdown of C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) to block cell entry by human immunodeficiency virus [3], the expression of glucagon-like peptide 1 mime ovirus serotype 5 (AdV5) or adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) cannot be used because the virus is so widespread that many people have a pre-existing immunity. non-viral vectors are far less immunogenic than viral vectors. RNA delivery for RNA interference comes with the difficulty of expense and scale because they turn over so quickly. non-viral DNA vectors have enabled a number of clinical trails. plasmids integrate at a rate of less than 105 stable integrants per transfected cell [22] and can be delivered repeatedly. polygenic cancer 1/2 Data were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov on January 16, 2017 [23]. 2allergic rhinitis (n = 3), food allergy (n = 1), osteogenesis (n = 1), secondary Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon (n = 1), arteriosclerosis (n = 3), bone tissue repair (n = 1); 3cytomegalovirus (n = 4), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (n = 1). plasmids with conditional origin of replication; 7operator repressor titration plasmids; 8minimalistic immunologically defined gene expression. plasmids are generally inefficient at delivering payloads compared to viruses. some of these delivery methods lead to breakage of plasmid DNA backbone. plasmids encode genes (typically antibiotic resistance-encoding genes) for selection of plasmid-harboring bacteria. the use of antibiotics and their resistance genes in the preparation of plasmid vectors is discouraged because of the risk of transfer and replication of resistance genes to bacteria. selectable marker system has only minimal bacterial sequences encoded on the plasmid (ori and short operator sequences), requires no plasmid gene expression, promotes plasmid stability, and, if need be for production, can be used in any microorganism able to propagate plasmids. pORT has been used effectively in pre-clinical and clinical studies as a DNA vaccine [37,38,39] and as a component of live bacterial vaccines in both cases, pFAR vectors displayed higher gene expression and persistence than standard plasmid vectors. removal of antibiotic resistance sequences also meant costly and time-consuming procedures for evaluating the amount of residual antibiotics left in vector preparation could be eliminated. pFAR Vector is only 1.1 kb The amber mutation used is very efficiently suppressed Growth medium does not contain animal-derived components Production process yields mostly monomeric closed circular DNA Both the plasmid and host strain are well-defined. nebulization shear forces Not well-known in the field [33,71,72,73] Miniknot Potentially superior compactness Potentially resistant to nicking Potentially valuable for forceful administration procedures (e.g., aerosolization, jet-injection, etc.) bacterial sequences before splicing occur [90] ori : origin of replication; AR: antibiotic resistance; pFAR: plasmids free of antibiotic resistance; pFAR: plasmids with conditional origin of replication; pFAR: plasmids with conditional origin of replication; pFAR: plasmids with conditional origin of replication; pFAR: plasmids with conditional origin of replication; pFAR: recombinase systems used to generate minicircles include phage integrase, phiC31 recombinase, Flp recombinase, ParA resolvase, and Cre recombinase. miniplasmids encode ori, and are therefore still referred to as plasmids. several methods for improving minicircle purity have been developed. minivectors are synthesized from a parent plasmid via site-specific recombination. integrase mediates the intramolecular recombination of the attB and attP sites. the catenanes are unlinked by topoisomerase IV. minicircles and minivectors transfect cells better in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo [31,32,33], express transgenes more effectively [67,96], and have an improved safety profile for clinical use. increased negative supercoiling makes minivectors even more compact. karyopherins facilitate transport across the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes. if NLSs are added directly to DNA vectors, time into the nucleus could be reduced. some methods include electrostatic attraction, covalent linkage via chemical conjugation. the advances afforded by these proof-of-principle experiments will hopefully translate into the clinic in the future. the advances afforded by these proof-of-principle experiments will hopefully translate into the clinic. minicircles and minivectors exist episomally and do not replicate on their own. effectiveness dilutes with cell division or cell death. one way to circumvent transient nature of minicircles and minivectors would be to engineer them to contain scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) 65% of cells produced a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter 55 days post-transfection with the minicircle compared to only 3% of GFP-positive cells after transfection with the plasmid. similar results were seen in hydrodynamically injected mouse liver. inclusion of viral sequences in episomal vector systems has granted them extended replication in mammalian cells. the generation of viral hybrid vector systems was an attempt to circumvent the safety concerns of viral vectors. there is potential for minimized vector systems to encode these viral sequences, thus turning them into minimized episomes. inclusion of these sequences would result in increased vector length. miniplasmids encode ori, and are therefore still referred to as plasmids. plasmids can be as high as 10% of the total yield\u2014well above the 1.5% allowed by some health regulatory agencies. integrase mediates intramolecular recombination of attB and attP sites. catenanes are unlinked by topoisomerase IV. minicircles and minivectors transfect cells better in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. reducing vector length for gene delivery and transgene expression has been well established. increased negative supercoiling makes minivectors even more compact. minicircles and minivectors are a good choice for gene therapy trials. the slow rate is probably a consequence of the time it takes for exogenous DNA and NLS-containing proteins to associate with each other inside the cell. some methods include electrostatic attraction, covalent linkage via direct chemical conjugation, or complexation of DNA and NLS-containing proteins. unmethylated CpG motifs from bacterial DNA are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) members of the TLR family of proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors capable of detecting certain PAMPs. TLR-9, in particular, can detect unmethylated CpG motifs, which are at least four times more common in prokaryotic DNA. S/MARs are endogenous AT-rich sequences that play an important role in the spatial organization of chromosomes through DNA loop base attachment to the nuclear matrix. to confer function as an episome, an S/MAR sequence must be encoded downstream of an actively transcribed gene. luciferase expression in cells transfected with minicircles without S/MARs. luciferase expression in glioma cells after one week. but minicircles containing S/MAR expressed luciferase for 92 days. the inclusion of viral sequences in episomal vector systems has granted them extended replication in mammalian cells. nuclear localization signals (NLSs) would be useful for therapeutic applications. most exogenous naked DNA or complexed DNA vectors are too large to passively diffuse through the nuclear membrane [18,100] the advances afforded by these proof-of-principle experiments will hopefully translate into the clinic in the future. the advances afforded by these proof-of-principle experiments will hopefully translate into the clinic in the future. minicircles and minivectors exist episomally and do not replicate on their own. effectiveness dilutes with cell division or cell death. plasmid vectors are four times more common in prokaryotic DNA than in eukaryotic DNA. only a few S/MAR sequences have been validated to confer episomal vector maintenance. a direct comparison of a S/MAR-containing minicircle to a S/MAR-containing plasmid revealed that 65% of cells stably produced a green fluorescent protein reporter 55 days post-transfection with the minicircle. the inclusion of viral sequences in episomal vector systems has granted them extended replication in mammalian cells. other viruses, such as SV40 and papillomaviruses, have similar systems with trans-acting elements that allow them to replicate in mammalian cells. failure to elicit desired levels of immunogenic responses was a result of poor transfection, transient antigen expression, and transgene silencing. more prolonged and sustained antigen expression can be achieved with minimized vectors than with plasmid vectors [70,130] DNA vaccines are being pursued as a replacement for live attenuated virus vaccines for the seasonal influenza virus. one such polyvalent DNA influenza vaccine was recently successfully tested in rabbits and pigs. minivectors encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in 2011, they showed increased transfection efficiency and gene silencing capability of minivectors compared to plasmid. they showed increased transfection efficiency and gene silencing capability of minivectors compared to plasmid. iPSCs were created from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells using minicircles with the same four reprogramming factors. the minicircle had over five-fold higher transfection efficiency than the plasmid. minicircle-transfected cells had a ten-fold increase in BDNF secretion over plasmid-transfected cells. lower and more prolonged gene expression afforded by minicircles or minivectors reduces the number of therapeutic treatments needed. less vector administrations reduces the potential for adaptive immune responses, such as are seen with the use of viral vectors or plasmids. microcircles encoding either shRNA or miRNA renew hope of combating heart disease with gene therapy. one application for gene therapy of the skin is wound healing in diabetics. a minicircle construct expressed VEGF more effectively than the plasmid constructs. three clinical trials have been performed to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) using a plasmid DNA vaccine expressing the S envelope protein of HBV. despite numerous pre-clinical studies, only one plasmid vector vaccine has been approved for use in humans at this time. DNA vaccines are being pursued as a replacement for live attenuated virus vaccines for the seasonal influenza virus. one such polyvalent DNA influenza vaccine was recently successfully tested in rabbits and pigs. minivectors transfect Jurkat cells, which are normally refractory to transfection. minicircles were also recently used to engineer T-cells with Sleeping Beauty transposon [143] and were further used to deliver bi-specific antibodies, allowing T-cells to kill B-cell lymphomas [144] iPSC reprogrammed with minicircle DNA formed embryoid bodies in culture and teratomas in immune-deficient mice. they found minicircle efficiency was higher than that of plasmid DNA. the minicircle had over five-fold higher transfection efficiency than the plasmid. eGFP, firefly luciferase (Luc), or DNAH5, encode an outer dynein arm protein involved in primary ciliary dyskinesia. higher and more prolonged gene expression afforded by minicircles or minivectors reduces the number of therapeutic treatments needed. minicircles encoding either shRNA or miRNA also renew hope of combating heart disease with gene therapy. one application for gene therapy of the skin is wound healing in diabetics. the total number of reported active gene therapy clinical trials is 2,400 [165] non-viral DNA vectors have been thus far used less frequently than viral vectors. other non-viral vector systems described in this review, such as pFAR and minicircles, have been tested only pre-clinically. gene fragmentation and protein reconstitution are tools that can be easily integrated into minimized DNA vectors. minimized DNA vectors are potentially better suited for the treatment of polygenic diseases because multiple vectors can be delivered simultaneously."}
