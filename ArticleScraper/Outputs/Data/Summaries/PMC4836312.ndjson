{"summary": "influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses are important respiratory pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (1\u20134). they possess segmented negative-strand RNA genomes that are encapsidated with nucleoprotein (NP) and bound with polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1, and PA) TRIMs are characterized by a highly conserved RING B-box coiled-coil motif. TRIM's C-terminal portions exhibit high variability in domain structures. TRIM-NHL proteins in subfamily C-VII, such as TRIM32 and TRIM71, harbor SPRY and/or PRY domains facilitating protein-protein interactions. TRIM25 promotes ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I to sense IAV infection and induce IFN expression. TRIM22 inhibits IAV by polyubiquitinating viral NP and targets it for proteasome-dependent degradation. TRIM56 is a novel player in innate antiviral immunity (23\u201325) TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of influenza viruses. the entire N-terminal TRIM motif was dispensable. TRIM56 impedes viral RNA synthesis via its C-terminal-tail portion. human embryo kidney (HEK293), HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were maintained in modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. HEK293-FIT cells were cotransfected with pOG44 encoding the Flp recombinase and pcDNA5/FRT the resultant cell lines were designated 293-FIT-T56-CTT135 and -CTT63 respectively. these cells were cultured in Tet-containing medium for 24 to 48 h. other cells conditionally expressed HA-tagged TRIM56 and various TRIM56 mutants. the cytopathic effect was recorded and used for calculation of infectivity at 24 h postinfection (hpi) for IAV and 48 hpi for IBV. all viral titers were expressed as TCID50/ml. RNA interference. a 28S-specific primer (5\u2032 CTTAACGGTTTCACGCCCTC 3\u2032) was also included in the RT reaction mixture. a luciferase reporter-based minigenome replication assay of IAV RNA synthesis was performed as previously described. megalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV; Promega) was an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency. cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and subject to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and rabbit anti-goat PAbs; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary donkey anti-mouse and chicken anti-goat PAbs. SPSS 11.5 software was employed to perform Student's t test for analysis of statistical differences. human embryo kidney (HEK293), HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were maintained in modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. HEK293-FIT cells were cotransfected with pOG44 encoding the Flp recombinase and pcDNA5/FRT the resultant cell lines were designated 293-FIT-T56-CTT135 and -CTT63. other cells conditionally expressing HA-tagged TRIM56 and various TRIM56 mutants (HEK293-FIT-T56-WT or -Mut) cytopathic effect was recorded and used for calculation of infectivity at 24 h postinfection (hpi) for IAV and 48 hpi for IBV. all viral titers were expressed as TCID50/ml. RNA interference. qPCR primers were used for measuring the mRNA abundance of the SeV P gene. luciferase reporter-based minigenome replication assay of IAV RNA synthesis was performed as previously described (27, 33, 34) plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase served as an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency. cells were lysed and processed for dual-luciferase assay. immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining, and confocal microscopy performed. TRIM56 is a restriction factor of four positive-strand RNA viruses, including three members of the family Flaviviridae (BVDV, YFV, and DENV2) and a member of the family Coronaviridae (24, 25) the propagation of the virus was not affected by ectopic expression of TRIM56 (24) significant HA-TRIM56 protein was detected following Tet addition to the culture medium (+Tet) NP expression was diminished in cells induced for HA-TRIM56 expression (+Tet, lane 4) this antiviral effect persisted at later time points (i.e., 16, 24, and 48 hpi) ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes propagation of IAV and IBV. expression of TRIM56 was reduced by 80% in the knockdown cells (MDBK-T56 shT56) compared with control cells (MDBK-T56 ctrl) transduced with a scrambled, negative-control shRNA. this is a reproducible phenomenon, regardless of expression system or cell type. expression of IAV NP was detected with an anti-influenza virus NP MAb. Actin served as a loading control to demonstrate equal sample loading. progeny virus production in culture supernatants of 293-FIT-T56 cells. culture supernatants of 293-FIT-T56 cells with or without Tet treatment at 24 hpi with influenza B/Florida/4/06 (Yamagata) virus (MOI = 0.1) immunoblot analysis of HA-tagged TRIM56 (using an anti-HA tag MAb [invivogen] not cross-reacting with IBV HA) and viral HA (using an anti-influenza B/Hong Kong/8/73 virus induction of TRIM56 expression in 293-FIT-T56 cells led to sharp decline in viral HA antigen abundance compared with Tet (uninduced) cells at 24 hpi with influenza B/Florida/4/06 virus (MOI = 0.1) progeny virus production in +Tet cells was 7-fold (P 0.05) lower than in Tet cells. cells induced for HA-TRIM56 expression and uninduced cells were compared. the lack of an antiviral effect on these paramyxoviruses suggests that TRIM56 does not target negative-strand RNA viruses indiscriminately. we previously demonstrated that TRIM56 overexpression does not inhibit VSV propagation. TRIM56 expressed at physiological levels puts a check on infection by influenza A and B viruses. qPCR analysis of boT56 mRNA expression in control MDBK cells (Ctrl) and their derived cells (T56i) stably transfected with a boT56 shRNA. TRIM56 exerts antiviral actions against positive-strand RNA viruses. the RING and the E3 ligase activity conferred by this domain are required to inhibit flaviviruses and HCoV-OC43. progeny virus production was curtailed by 1 log unit by induction of WT TRIM56 (P 0.001) or any of the mutant TRIM56-inducible cells except the line that expresses the 693-750 mutant. the restriction of IAV by TRIM56 relies on its C-terminal tail portion, but not on its E3 ligase activity or other parts of the protein. data from each cell line are presented in an immunoblot block (8 blocks in total, representing 8 different WT/Mut TRIM56-inducible cell lines) asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between MDBK and WT/Mut T56-overexpressing cells or between Tet and +Tet cells. abundant NP antigen was detected in MDBK-Bsr cells expressing a control vector (lane 1). however, there was a profound reduction in NP expression in cells expressing WT TRIM56 (lane 3), the CC21/24AA mutant (lane 4), and the RING (lane 5) and coiled-coil (lane 6) mutants. the TRIM56 C-terminal tail is the only prerequisite for its anti-IBV function. shown is progeny virus production in culture supernatants of 293-FIT-derived T56 WT or individual mutant cells in the absence (tet) of Tet at 24 hpi with influenza B/Florida/4/06 virus (MOI = 0.1) expression of the TRIM56 C-terminal tail alone is sufficient to curb infection by IAV or IBV. in subsequent experiments, we used IAV to probe how TRIM56 executes its anti-influenza virus actions. asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells. TRIM56 curtails influenza virus propagation by targeting virus RNA synthesis, but not the release step. incoming influenza vRNPs are first transported into the nucleus. the viral mRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm for translation into nascent viral proteins that are required for cRNA and vRNA synthesis (e.g., NP) at a late stage of the infection, vRNAs are exported out of the nucleus for virion packaging and budding (4, 12) abundances of cRNA and mRNA were 3-fold and 7-fold lower in MDBK-T56 cells. vRNA levels did not increase in MDBK-T56 cells at 4 hpi. vRNA levels did not increase in MDBK-T56 cells at 4 hpi. qPCR analysis of vRNA (A), cRNA (B), and mRNA (C) levels of the M gene segment of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus in MDBK cells stably expressing a control vector (Bsr) or TRIM56 (T56) at 1, 4, 8, and 12 hpi (MOI = 3) the error bars represent standard deviations. pol II promoter controls transcription of the antisense strand of firefly luciferase RNA. a sixth plasmid, pCMV-RL, expresses Renilla luciferase from the promoter. relative luciferase activity is proportional to the level of influenza virus RNA synthesis. TRIM56 suppresses influenza virus RNA synthesis by hindering the viral RNA synthesis step. Luc reporter-based minigenome replication assay was performed in 293-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the presence (+tet) or absence (tet) of Tet at 24 and 48 hpt. asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells. green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TRIM56 is a cytosolic protein in resting cells. the protein resided exclusively in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells. the presence of TRIM56 and TRIM56-CTT63 in the nucleus is consistent with their ability to impede influenza virus RNA synthesis. HA-tagged TRIM56 and TRIM56-CTT63 were immunostained with an anti-HA tag MAb (Invivogen) and IAV M proteins with a goat anti-matrix antiserum. nuclei were counterstained blue with DAPI. if manipulation of TRIM56 abundance alters propagation of influenza viruses, we first used HEK293-FIT-derived cells with Tet-inducible expression of HA-tagged TRIM56 (25). negligible expression of HA-TRIM56 protein was observed in these cells when cultured in the absence of Tet (Tet) but considerable HA-TRIM56 protein was detected following Tet addition to the culture medium (+Tet) ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes propagation of IAV. ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes propagation of IAV. this is a reproducible phenomenon, regardless of expression system or cell type. +Tet cells (lanes 2 and 2) were kept in Tet-containing media until they were lysed for Western blotting. expression of HA-tagged TRIM56 was detected using an anti-HA tag antibody. expression of IAV NP was detected with an anti-influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus NP MAb. immunoblot analysis of ectopically expressed human TRIM56 (using anti-TRIM56 antibody) in MDBK-T56 cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding either an shRNA specifically targeting human TRIM56 (MDBK-T56 shT56) or a scrambled control shRNA (MDBK-T56 ctrl) 293-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the absence (tet) or presence (+tet) of tetracycline were infected with SeV for 8 h. asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between the indicated cells. influenza viruses (IAV and IBV) represent the first negative-strand RNA virus family TRIM56 was found to inhibit. to determine whether TRIM56 also restricts other negative-strand RNA viruses, we studied the effects of TRIM56 overexpression on hMPV and SeV. TRIM56 knockdown of TRIM56 (shT56) yielded 6-fold (P 0.01) more progeny IAV than control cells. TRIM56 expressed at physiological levels puts a check on infection by influenza A and B viruses. bled control shRNA or HeLa-shT56 (shT56) cells transduced with shRNA specifically targeting TRIM56. asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between the indicated cells. TRIM56 exerts antiviral actions against positive-strand RNA viruses. mutants included for analysis were the CC21/24AA mutant. mutants lacking the RING (RING), B-box (B-box), or coiled-coil (coiled-coil) domain. expression levels of these mutants have been confirmed to be comparable to that of wild-type TRIM56 (25) TRIM56 protein domains and individual TRIM56 mutants investigated in this study. progeny virus production in culture supernatants of 293-FIT-T56-WT or individual TRIM56 mutant cells cultured in the absence (tet) or presence (+tet) of Tet at 9 hpi with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (MOI = 0.1) asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between MDBK and WT/Mut T56-overexpressing cells or between Tet and +Tet cells. abundant NP antigen was detected in MDBK-Bsr cells expressing a control vector (lane 1). however, NP expression was not reduced but increased (lane 7) compared with parental MDBK cells (lane 2). cells compared with Tet cells at 24 hpi with the influenza B/Florida/4/06 virus (MOI = 0.1) were abrogated only in cells harboring the 693-750 mutant. expression of the C-terminal tail of TRIM56 alone is sufficient to restrict influenza virus infection. aa 621 to 755, referred to as CTT135) and 63 (i.e., aa 693 to 755) residues at the very C-terminal end of TRIM56 contain the minimal determinant for the antiviral function of the full-length protein. the same could be said when we infected with a/PR/8/34 virus (MOI = 0.1) asterisks indicate expression of HA-tagged WT TRIM56 (293-FIT-T56-WT), CTT135 (293-FIT-T56-CTT135) or CTT63 (293-FIT-T56-CTT63) in absence (tet) or presence (+tet) of Tet. immunoblot analysis of NP (using anti-influenza A/WSN/33 [H1N1] virus NP MAb) TRIM56 curtails influenza virus propagation by targeting virus RNA synthesis, but not the release step. incoming influenza vRNPs are first transported into the nucleus. vRNAs serve as the templates for synthesis of mRNAs and cRNAs. yields of progeny viruses in cell-free culture supernatants at 8 and 12 hpi were determined by TCID50 assay. at 1 hpi, intracellular vRNA levels of A/PR/8/34 virus in MDBK-T56 and MDBK-Bsr cells were indistinguishable. abundances of cRNA and mRNA were 3-fold and 7-fold lower in MDBK-T56 cells. vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA levels remained 4- to 7-fold lower in MDBK-T56 cells at both 8 and 12 hpi. this data show that there is a sustained influence on influenza virus vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA levels throughout the life cycle in TRIM56-overexpressing cells. however, it is unknown whether the influence on synthesis of viral RNAs occurs throughout this time frame or only in the early stages of infection. a luciferase reporter-based minigenome replication assay was performed to measure IAV transcription and replication in 293-FIT-T56 cells with (+Tet) and without (Tet) induction of HA-tagged TRIM56. this system involves cotransfection of a total of six plasmids. in a fifth plasmid, the Pol I promoter controls transcription of the antisense strand of firefly luciferas replication assays in 693-750 mutant TRIM56-inducible cells and its parental HEK293-FIT (Ctrl) cells showed that this mutant loses the ability to suppress influenza virus RNA synthesis and ruled out any effect due to tetracycline treatment. expression of CTT63 alone was sufficient to inhibit influenza virus RNA synthesis. RNA synthesis in 293-FIT-T56 (WT) or 293-FIT-T56-CTT63 (CTT63) cells cultured with (+tet) or without Tet at 48 hpt. asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells. TRIM56 moves into the nucleus during influenza virus infection. HA-tagged TRIM56 and TRIM56-CTT63 were immunostained with an anti-HA tag MAb (invivogen) and IAV M proteins with a goat anti-matrix antiserum. TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of influenza A and B viruses. TRIM56 positively regulates innate antiviral signaling through TLR3- and STING-dependent pathways. TRIM56 acts as an E3 ligase that promotes ubiquitination of STING. a heightened IFN response is not responsible for TRIM56-mediated inhibition of four positive-strand RNA viruses, BVDV, YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. expression status was not surprising, given that IAV encodes multiple IFN antagonists, with NS1 being the most potent and best characterized (11, 38). innate antiviral response to IAV is primarily mediated by RIG-I, while TLR3 plays a more proinflammatory role (39). however, TRIM56 does not contribute to or regulate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling (23). TRIM56 specifically inhibits influenza virus RNA synthesis with its C-terminal-tail portion. a fraction of TRIM56 localized in the nucleus in IAV-infected cells. it is unclear whether TRIM56 is passively imported into or retained in the nucleus. TRIM56 interacts with influenza virus RNAs, altering their incorporation into the viral transcription/replication complex and/or their stability. intriguingly, the C-terminal region of TRIM56 (residues 521 to 748) exhibits sequence homology with NHL repeats, based on a search of the NCBI conserved domain database.
