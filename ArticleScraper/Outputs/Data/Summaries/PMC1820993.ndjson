{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major health problem of cattle worldwide. it inflicts considerable financial losses in beef herds [15,13] and is the most common cause of mortality in dairy cattle [35] only a few reports exist on respiratory diseases of cattle in Finland. the size of the beef-raising herds varied between 48 and 217 (mean 107) animals. the dairy herds had 30\u2013130 (mean 72) cows. five diseased calves from each farm were chosen for closer examination. the age of the diseased calves varied from 31 to 221 (mean 98) days. the quantity of the collected fluid varied from 2 ml to over 20 ml. samples were cultured on blood agar (tryptose-soya-agar containing 5% bovine blood) the susceptibility of different Pasteurella sp. isolates was tested. 123 samples from 94 animals were tested for antibodies to bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) an ELISA test was used for antibodies to PIV-3, BRSV, BCV and BVDV. if a fourfold increase occurred in antibody titre in the neutralization test, the calf was considered to have a rise in titre. blood samples for serological studies were taken from all calves at the beginning of the study. second samples were taken from 86 calves 3\u20134 weeks later. some samples were taken from animals aged over 6 months to avoid the influence of maternal antibodies. antimicrobials used were ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. the bacterial tests were performed according to the standard procedures of the national veterinary and food research institute in Helsinki. the ELISA kits were used according to manufacturer's instructions. if a fourfold increase occurred in antibody titre in the neutralization test or if the ELISA test was seronegative in the first sample and seropositive in the second sample, the calf was considered to have a rise in titre and to be recently infected with the relevant virus.
