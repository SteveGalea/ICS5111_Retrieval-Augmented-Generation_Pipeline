{"summary": "potential determinants can be grouped into 4 categories (Table 1) (4,5) the first group is related to the molecular characteristics of pathogens, such as virulence, transmissibility, and survival fitness. the second group is linked to prescribers of antimicrobial drugs, physicians, who may change their prescription patterns. new diagnostic tests will facilitate initiation or withdrawal of antimicrobial therapy soon after onset of symptoms, especially in the hospital setting. molecular diagnostics may increase diagnostic accuracy and enable more prudent antimicrobial drug use in the future. the threat of bioterrorism may foster research about rapid molecular diagnostic tests that may be used at the bedside. a plateau in global antimicrobial consumption seems to have been reached, leading to a saturated market. countries that have decreased either number of antimicrobial drug prescriptions or total volume of outpatient antimicrobial drugs used within the last 10 years. global threats such as the next influenza pandemic may also affect prescribing of antimicrobial drugs by reversing the trend of decreasing antimicrobial drug consumption. climate change may lead to a decrease in respiratory tract infections and antimicrobial drug use in the winter months. several countries have taken the bold step of launching national campaigns to educate physicians and patients about antimicrobial misuse and the threat of resistance. these campaigns show promise in changing attitudes and behavior, among both the public and healthcare professionals (20). if repeated regularly, the campaigns are likely to reduce inappropriate patient requests for antimicrobial agents, which in conjunction with physician education models may reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescription practices (21). more progress in pneumococcal vaccine development can be expected from conjugate vaccines that include more than 7 serotypes (25). but uncertainty remains regarding serotype replacement and the emergence of resistance in nonvaccine serotypes (25). other vaccines to prevent invasive, antimicrobial-resistant infections will be launched within the next 20 years (23). many believe that political measures to control antimicrobial drug use have only a negligible short-term effect (1,31) we argue that healthcare regulation will powerfully influence antimicrobial drug use in the future. a fixed fee for antimicrobial costs was attributed to each type of intervention. this regulatory restriction had a sustained effect on the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in Belgium (34). in many Asian countries, healthcare providers earn significant proportion of their income from dispensing drugs. in 1952, a famous French microbiologist anticipated pneumococci, gonococci, and meningococci would not change their antimicrobial susceptibility profile in the future. 40 years later, we were rapidly progressing towards a \"post-antimicrobial era\" in which doctors may become helpless against even common infections. antimicrobial resistance in high prevalence countries will be slowly reduced. multiresistant group A streptococci will render penicillin and macrolides useless in the treatment of pharyngitis. new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms will emerge and disseminate. the prevalence of MRSA in the US community will reach 25% within the next decade. no new antimicrobial classes or treatment strategies have been developed for gram-negative bacteria. no new antimicrobial classes or treatment strategies have been developed for gram-negative bacteria, and vaccines have not been widely effective. multiresistant group A streptococci will render penicillin and macrolides useless in the treatment of pharyngitis. multiresistant Acinetobacter spp., enterococci, and staphylococci will cause substantial illness. several disasters and pandemics will increase the use of antimicrobial drugs on a global scale, leading to emergence and dissemination of resistance. a continuing flood of consensus conference statements, position papers, and surveillance network reports will be issued about the problem of antibiotic resistance."}
