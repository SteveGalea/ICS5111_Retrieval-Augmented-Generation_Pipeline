{"summary": "RNA granules contain concentrations of translationally silenced host mRNPs. they regulate the mRNA cycle, metabolism, and gene expression. a common tendency of viruses is to block and/or coopt stress responses. nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNP granules include cajal bodies, histone locus bodies, nuclear speckles, nuclear stress bodies, and paraspeckles. the function of nuclear mRNP granules is diverse, from stress responsive granules to granules controlling processing of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. a continuum of RNA granules has been suggested to exist in eukaryotic cells with degrees of similarity to either SG or PBs. stress Granules SGs are reversible dynamic structures that rapidly form when cells encounter environmental stress that reduce global translation rates. stress granule assembly and interference by RNA viruses modulating PKR causes stress at multiple levels that reduces host translation through activation of eIF2 kinases. these translation insults convert active polysome mRNPs into stalled translation initiation complex mRNPs containing 40S ribosome subunits. viruses with limited genes have evolved efficient means to control their formation and function. SGs form from condensation of stalled translation initiation complexes. many of these are passenger proteins unlikely to have significant functions in SG biology. some VSGs contain Sam68 which is not found in HSSGs. aggregation of mRNPs into SGs may promote cell survival during stress conditions and rapid return to homeostasis at stress termination. RC homology 3 domains, prolinerich motifs or other low complexity amino acid sequences are capable of assembling liquid phase droplets. FUS has been proposed to function in RNA neuronal granules with G3BP and TDP43,33, 34, 35 though TDP43 may play a more prominent functional role in SGs. recruitment of mRNA to PBs requires active silencing via miRNA or RNAi mechanisms. the mechanism of PB formation is unclear but thought to involve condensation of RNAbinding proteins. 44 PBs dynamically exchange mRNP cargo with SGs. stress granules SGs are reversible dynamic structures that rapidly form when cells encounter environmental stress that reduces global translation rates. the most commonly described trigger of SG formation starts with oxidative, nutrient deprivation, or heat stress activation one of the eIF2 kinases. eIF2 kinases convert active polysome mRNPs into stalled translation initiation complex mRNPs containing 40S ribosome subunits, initiation factors and mRNAs. a complex series of events (not depicted) involving nucleation of multiple stress granule proteins such as G3BP1, Tia1/TIAR, TDRD3, FUS, TDP43, and HDAC6 plus transport of mRNP complexe eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF3, eIF2, PABP), mRNA and the 40S ribosome subunit.8, 9, 17 Additionally there are many RNAbinding proteins such as caprin1, FMRP, YB1, HuR, and TTP. presumably any protein that binds mRNA or interacts strongly with mRNPs may also be found in SGs. mRNAs of stress activated proteins may be preferentially excluded from SGs. aggregation of mRNPs into SGs may promote increased cell survival during stress conditions and rapid return to homeostasis at stress termination. emerging evidence shows SGs may be linked to signaling pathways. many RNAbinding proteins have domains suitable for this type of weak interaction. these proteins can also be affected by posttranslational modifications that can shift the equilibrium between the soluble and condensed phases. cytoplasmic aggregates containing some of these marker proteins are not necessarily SGs23. the composition of SGs can vary depending on the type of stress that induced them. a thorough evaluation of functional constituents of aggregates is required to distinguish SGs from unique virusinduced foci. the actual molecular mechanism of mRNP aggregation into granules remains elusive. recent advances provide clues how RNA granules assemble components into coherent structures while simultaneously facilitating dynamic molecular exchange. this may entail formation of liquid droplets or condensed gel phases that can better be envisioned as dynamic RNA/protein droplets. PBs contain deadenylases, decapping enzymes, exonucleases, RNAbinding proteins involved in nonsensemediated decay and microRNAmediated silencing. the mechanism of PB formation is unclear but thought to involve condensation of RNAbinding proteins as well as the mRNA itself as an organizing structure. Virus blockade and coopting of stress granule responses are shown. HCV diverts G3BP1 into replication complexes together with HCV core, ns5A and ns5B proteins that also associate with lipid droplets. the discussion below is categorized into classes based on mechanisms of virus interaction with the RNA granule machinery. cleavage of RNA granule factors, control of PKR function, and (3) coopting of RNA granule proteins. this review is not comprehensive and these groupings will likely require future revision. poliovirus unlinks TIA1 aggregation from condensation of translation initiation factors in stress granules, likely through cleavage of G3BP1. poliovirus infection induces eIF2 phosphorylation, which simultaneously drives SG formation and inhibits cellular protein synthesis machinery required for viral RNA translation. plethora of viral mechanisms exist to counteract its activation. PKR activation and resulting translation inhibition strongly induces SG formation. some viruses may also activate PERK through an unfolded protein response, which should result in similar downstream SG formation. eIF2 phosphorylation is required for uncoating of the virus, with MRV induction of stress granules. eIF2 phosphorylation is required for uncoating of the virus, with MRV induction of stress granules as a consequence. MRV-induced SGs are depleted and preferential translation occurs despite continued eIF2 phosphorylation. it is unclear whether MRV translation persists through an alternate eIF2independent translation mechanisms similar to poliovirus, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Sindbis virus. the induction of SGs is dependent on PKR activation and disassembly is dependent on GADD34 which regulates dephosphorylation of eIF2 58. the coronaviruses Transmissible Gastroenteritis (TGEV) and Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus (MHC) both form TIARcontaining granules as infection progresses. many cellular RNA regulatory proteins are linked to virus replication schemes. no cleavage of SG proteins has been documented, unlike picornaviruses. SFV nsP3 sequesters G3BP1 into viral replication complexes. effective translation of viral RNAs with this motif also helps disassemble SGs during infection. nsP4 is found in immunoprecipitation complexes with G3BP1 and 2.62. depletion of G3BP1 and 2 abrogates SGs during infection. proteins colocalize with replicase components in perinuclear regions of cells during WNV and DENV infections. both G3BP1 and 2 bind the 3\u2032 UTR of DENV genomic RNA. it is unclear what role these proteins have on dengue virus replication. the virusinduced G3BP1containing foci are not normal SG since they contain neither PABP nor TIA1. some initiation factors including eIF4G and eIF4A and large and small ribosomal subunit proteins L10a and S6 are also present in replication\u2013transcription complexes. the discussion below is categorized into classes based on mechanisms of virus interaction with the RNA granule machinery. cleavage of RNA granule factors, control of PKR function, and (3) coopting of RNA granule proteins. this review is not comprehensive and these groupings will likely require future revision. poliovirus unlinks TIA1 aggregation from condensation of translation initiation factors in stress granules, likely through cleavage of G3BP1. poliovirus infection induces eIF2 phosphorylation, which simultaneously drives SG formation and inhibits cellular protein synthesis machinery required for viral RNA translation. plethora of viral mechanisms exist to counteract its activation. PKR activation and resulting translation inhibition strongly induces SG formation but mRNP aggregation also induces PKR activation. rotavirus actively takes over host translation partly by actively promoting phosphorylation of eIF2 through activities of viral proteins VP2, NSP2 and NSP5.52. eIF2 phosphorylation still partly restricts rotavirus translation and/or replication since virus replicates more efficiently in eIF2 mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. MRV-induced SGs are depleted and preferential translation occurs despite continued eIF2 phosphorylation. it is unclear whether MRV translation persists through alternate eIF2independent translation mechanisms similar to poliovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Sindbis virus. coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis Coronavirus (MHC) both form TIARcontaining granules as infection progresses60, 61 that correlate with an increase in eIF2 phosphorylation early in infection (TGEV) no cleavage of SG proteins has been documented, unlike picornaviruses. SFV nsP3 sequesters G3BP1 into viral replication complexes and simultaneously inhibits SG formation. effective translation of viral RNAs with this motif also helps disassemble SGs during infection. nsP4 is found in immunoprecipitation complexes with G3BP1 and 2.62. depletion of G3BP1 and 2 abrogates SGs during infection. it is unclear what role these proteins have on dengue virus replication. it is possible that stress granule proteins in new contexts promote virus translation or RNA replication. flaviviruses may recruit stress granule proteins to prevent strong innate immune responses induced by SG assembly. G3BP1 colocalizes with viral protein N in novel foci that augment the infection. it may also sequester it and disassemble stress granules. it is unclear if G3BP functions in replication. the order of association of factors with mRNPs in PBs is arbitrary. HCV subverts many PB components into novel viral replication/assembly foci. flaviviruses also divert PB factors into replication foci. influenza virus slowly disperses PBs during replication by forming a complex containing viral protein NS1 and cellular RAP55. a viral benefit of NS1\u2013RAP55 complex formation is to prevent viral nucleoprotein (with viral RNP) from entering PBs. depletion via siRNA knockdown lowers viral RNA output. sfRNA can colocalize with Xrn1 in some PBs. sfRNA has emerging roles in inhibiting host nucleases involved in gene regulation. PB proteins include DDX6 (Rck/p54), Lsm1, PATL1, and Xrn123, 74. DDX6, PatL1, and the Lsm17 heptameric ring play pivotal roles in the HCV life cycle at the translational and RNA replication levels. viral RNA and the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase were all required for entry of viral mRNA into replication complexes on membranes. some PBs can associate with membranes where viral replication complexes are built. PBs and its cleavage may trigger PB dispersal,81. dicistrovirus cricket paralysis virus moderately disrupts PB in insect cells by late times in infection. the flavivirus west Nile virus sequests several PB components to viral replication centers. DDX6 knockdown reduced virus replication. sfRNA can colocalize with Xrn1 in some PBs. sfRNA has emerging roles in inhibiting host nucleases. Knockdown of PB proteins DDX3, DDX6, Lsm1, and PatL123, 90 or RCK/p54 and Ge174 reduced HCV replication. these may be more in viral assembly than viral RNA replication. Hantavirus transcripts must flux out of PBs to reenter the soluble cytoplasmic milieu to engage ribosomes to translate virus proteins. the trends described above were echoed in studies of replication of the plant virus Brome mosaic virus in a yeast system. PKR may sense formation of stress granules per se through a unique mechanism of activation. once activated, PKR may signal downstream to several innate immune effectors. it is interesting that PKR also enters stress granules. poliovirus RNA does not enter VSGs24 thus, inclusion of viral RNA in SGs is variable depending on the WT versus mutant forms of virus. the stressresponsive MAPK JNK is activated in a noncanonical manner during stress granule formation. this is especially true for the various types of VSGs as opposed to SGs induced by overwhelming insults such as arsenite or heat shock. the roles of these proteins in virus replication and package require investigation. the persistence of one type of granule containing one or two marker proteins does not mean that a functional SG or PB is present in the cell. 123"}
