RNA binding was tested according to the protocol described for a 96-well format in a Ribogreen kit. plasma and liver tissue exposure to BMS-791325 was assessed in rats, dogs, and monkeys. male beagle dogs (9 to 12 kg; n = 6; Marshall Farms USA Inc., North Rose, NY, USA) were orally administered BMS-791325 (3 mg/kg) in a mixture of PEG-400 (95%, vol/vol), po plasma samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until analyzed. liver samples (approximately 2 to 3 g per animal) were rinsed, weighed, and stored frozen. the mobile phases for the analytical column consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (B) the mobile phases were delivered as a gradient at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. a number of cell lines derived from various tissue origins were used to assess its cytotoxicity. BMS-791325 cytotoxicity (CC50) was 14 M in a panel of cell lines representing liver, T lymphocytes, lung, and kidney following incubation for 3 to 4 days. it was more than 3,000-fold below cytotoxic concentrations. ovir, 0.08 and 0.31 M, respectively, influenza virus (EC50 of BMS-659, 9 M), CPIV (EC50 of BMS-011, 0.1 M), human rhinovirus (EC50 of rupintrivir, 9 nM), coxsackie virus (EC50 of rupintrivir, 135 nM), and poliovirus (EC50 of rupintrivir, 82 nM) BMS-791325 did not display nonspecific DNA or RNA binding (IC50, >20 M) in competition assays against sensitive nucleic acid-binding probes. positive controls were run in each experiment. replicon culture systems are not available for all six major HCV genotypes. the cross-genotype activity of BMS-791325 was investigated by evaluating antiviral activity against hybrid replicons bearing clinical NS5B sequences. EC50s ranged from 1.6 to 5.3 nM for GT 1a and from 3.5 to 9.5 nM for GT 1b. 25 exhibited high potency against GT 6a hybrid replicons generated from two patients (pt-752 and pt-tt003) with EC50s (8.6 nM and 9.7 nM) similar to those observed for GT 1. but a GT 6a replicon generated from a third patient was approximately 9-fold less susceptible to BMS-791325.

L392I, observed previously in GT 1a under in vitro selection and conferring low-level (5- to 7-fold) loss of susceptibility (38); and V494A, also observed in currently unpublished data. minority of database sequences (21%) with V494 conserved in the remaining 79%. NS5B sequence from the GT 6a patient isolate pt-hn001 showed lower susceptibility to BMS-791325 in a hybrid replicon culture.

BMS-791325 demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of HCV GT 1a and 1b replicons, with EC50s of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively. it did not significantly affect replication of a panel of other RNA and DNA viruses, including the closely related BVDV, with EC50s of >4 M. BVDV (EC50 of UPS-1453, 0.6 M), HIV (EC50 of BMS-035, 1.5 nM), HSV-1 and -2 (EC50s of acyclovir, 0.08 and 0.31 M, respectively), influenza virus (EC50 of BMS-659, 9 M), CPIV (EC50 of BMS-011, 0.1 M), human rhinovirus (EC50 of rupintrivir, 9 nM), coxsackie virus (EC50 the IC50 against isolated HCV NS5B (GT 1b) was 3 nM, more than 8,000-fold lower than that for any other polymerase tested or for HIV-1 integrase. control inhibitors used for each assay inhibited the enzymes with the expected IC50s. replicon culture systems are not available for all six major HCV genotypes. the cross-genotype activity of BMS-791325 was investigated by evaluating antiviral activity against hybrid replicons bearing clinical NS5B sequences and inhibition of purified NS5Bs from GTs 1 to 6. ency similar to that for GT 1 against hybrid replicons containing clinical NS5B sequences from GTs 3a, 4a, and 5a. a GT 6a replicon generated from a third patient (pt-hn001) was approximately 9-fold less susceptible to BMS-791325. 1.8 0.1 pt-002 4.7 1.5 ND pt-007 3.5 2.1 ND pt-341 9.5 3.5 ND pt-342 7.5 0.7 ND 4a Database consensuse ND 19.9 9.6 pt-H2 6 2.9 ND pt-A 3 0.6 7.6 1.9 pt-B 18 2.5 27.1 13.1 5a Database consensusf ND 4.8 2.4 pt-h3 4.3 in vitro polymerase assays gave BMS-791325 IC50s that ranged from 1.8 nM to 27.1 nM for GT 1, 3, 4, and 5 NS5B. the good concordance observed between BMS-791325 potency in the in vitro polymerase and cell-based assays confirms that inhibition of viral RNA replication is indeed due to inhibition of NS5B polymerase activity. GT 1a elevations (34- to 35-fold; 136 to 140 nM) were similar to those observed at 10, whereas GT 1b elevations were somewhat higher (34- to 40-fold; 238 to 280 nM) than that at 10. In this study, genotypic analysis of the selected cells identified substitutions conferring resistance to BMS-791325 only at a single residue of NS5B (P495). 0.1 P495L 154 25 31 0.3 290 111 36 0.1 P495T 293 124 59 0.1 L392Ic 5\u20137 0.1\u20130.4 a Mean standard deviation from two or more independent experiments. naturally occurring variations at three positions in NS5B were examined in HCV GTs 1 to 6 in sequences from the European HCV database. in GT 6a sequences, the A494 variant was present in a significant minority of database sequences (21%) with V494 conserved in the remaining 79%. it is of note that A494 was present in the NS5B sequence from the GT 6a patient isolate pt-hn001, discussed above. BMS-791325 retained full activity against mutations conferring resistance to other HCV inhibitors. the lack of cross-resistance to inhibitors targeting other HCV proteins, or different sites on NS5B, supports the use of BMS-791325 in DAA combination regimens, including those using multiple polymerase inhibitors. monotherapy treatment of a highly mutable, rapidly replicating pathogen can result in the rapid emergence of drug resistance (50) the antiviral activity of BMS-791325 in combination with representative agents against the major HCV drug targets was examined in GT 1a replicon cultures. plasma and liver concentrations of BMS-791325 were assessed in rats, dogs, and monkeys following oral dosing. rats dosed with BMS-791325 were monitored over 48 h, dogs monitored over 72 h, and monkeys were monitored over 24 h. animals showed the highest liver-to-plasma ratios across the species, measured both by 24-h concentration (60:1) and by AUC (24:1) DISCUSSION BMS-791325 showed robust antiviral activity in an early single-ascending-dose study. mean HCV RNA declines of approximately 1.5 and 2.5 log10 IU/ml at 24 h after administration of a single 100-mg or 300-mg dose. this inhibition resulted in potent antiviral activity in cell-based subgenomic replicons of HCV expressing consensus and/or clinical NS5B sequences for GT 1 is susceptible to inhibition by BMS-791325. the three NS5B sequences were 97 to 98% identical at the amino acid level. two showed susceptibilities to BMS-791325 in hybrid replicons. substitutions at NS5B codon 495 were also seen by Pelosi et al. (38) in combination with the same NS5A resistance substitutions but not in combination with L392I. the substitution may represent an alternative pathway to thumb site 1 inhibitor resistance that is more readily selected under joint selective pressure with other DAAs. in vitro combination experiments showed that BMS-791325 has at least additive antiviral activity with representative agents from the major classes of oral direct-acting HCV antivirals. the presence of three nonoverlapping allosteric inhibitor-binding sites on NS5B offers an opportunity for the sequential or combined use of nonnucleoside NS5B inhibitors. hepatotropic disposition in vivo is a potentially beneficial property for drugs active in liver-specific disease. the liver-to-plasma ratios observed for BMS-791325 in rats, dogs, and monkeys were similar, although lower in magnitude, to the highly hepatotropic ratios seen for the NS3 protease inhibitor ASV in these species. nCT01455090 (60) and phase 3 studies of this 3-DAA regimen are ongoing."}
