{"summary": "swine influenza was first described in the united states in 1918 when the Spanish Flu pandemic occurred in the human population. 1, 2 Typical clinical signs in pigs are respiratory diseases with fever, coughing and nasal discharge, as in humans. 3 These signs may result in serious economic losses when pigs are raised and fattened on farms. production of pig meat in Thailand has tripled in the 37 years from 1971 to 2006. the number of pig farms including breeding and fattening farm also has increased about four times in the last decade. all the 12 viruses available at the National Institute of Animal Health, Thailand were subjected to the study. they included six H1N1 isolates designated as A/Sw/Ratchaburi/NIAH1481/00(Rat1481), A/Sw/Ratchaburi/NIAH550/03(Rat550), A/Sw/Chonburi/NIAH977/04(Chon977), A/Sw/Chonburi/NIAH9469/04 a total of 157 H1 genes including the Thai SIVs were analysed. the genes from Genbank were collected from a variety of viruses isolated in different years and from different subtypes. 11bp for H3, 1197bp for N1, 1242bp for N2, 2235bp for PB2, 2154bp for PB1, 945bp for M, 2079bp for PA, 770bp for NS and 1459bp for NP respectively. all of the sequences belonging to one particular lineage for each segment were used for regression analysis. one H1N2 isolate designated as A/Sw/Saraburi/13021/05(Sara13021) and five H3N2 isolates designated as A/Sw/Chachoengsao/03(Chacho03), A/Sw/Udon Thani/NIAH464/04(UT464) and Rat59 were isolated from pigs showing respiratory diseases. s were analysed by the ABI model 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) the sequences obtained in this study along with other sequences from humans, pigs, birds and equines were aligned. the gaps were removed using BioEdit software version 7053. of the H3 HA1 genes (Figure 1) and the N2 NA genes (Data not shown) revealed the existence of at least two distinct evolutional pathways in the human virus lineage. Rat59 and Rat874 belonged to the cluster Ha whereas Chacho03, UT464 and NP5861 belonged to the cluster Hb respectively. Cl, AL and H stand for classical swine, avianlike swine and human origins respectively. two distinct clusters of H1 HA genes of the Thai SIVs were designated as Cla and Clb. the topologies of the Thai SIVs in those phylogenetic trees coincide with each other. the PB1 gene of all the strains, except Rat59, showed a similar evolutional pathway to those seen in N1 and PB2 genes. they were derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1983 (95% confidence limit; 1980\u20131987). the years of divergence of the ALa were estimated as 1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988\u20131992) for the M gene and 1987 (95% confidence limit; 1985\u20131989) for the PA gene. NP5861 possessed M gene of ALa and PA gene of ALb. NP5861 clustered with Rat874 and Chacho03 within the classical swine lineage in the NP tree. the similarity of the topology with the NS tree suggested that those three isolates share a common genetic origin with the cluster Cla. however, the estimated year of origin of the NP Cla gene was older (1963; 95% confidence limit; 1955\u20131971) than that calculated for the NS and H1 Cla. this discrepancy was probably due to the low R the genetic diversity of the Thai SIVs was evident in Thai pig population even from a small number of viruses obtained between 2000 and 2005. the viruses containing genes from avianlike swine viruses appeared to have some advantages for being maintained in the pig population. 27 In 1993, avian H1N1 virus entered the Hong Kong pig population. it was an independent event from that observed in the European pig population in 1979. 28 Swine H3N2 viruses that were closely related to those isolated from the European pig population were isolated from Hong Kong pigs. genitor viruses with a combination of genes of Clb and ALa origin established elsewhere were introduced into the Thai pig population. there has been no report of such a progenitor virus in the world, although this does not exclude the possibility. the introduction of another human H3N2 virus (ancestral Ha virus) into the Thai pig populations was estimated to have occurred around 1998. at that time, our analyses indicated that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses had already cocirculated in the Thai pig population. dual infections with SIVs and other pathogens complicate the pathogenicity of the SIVs. we need further analyses of the SIVs in Thailand to deepen our understanding. virology 1993;193:503\u2013506.
