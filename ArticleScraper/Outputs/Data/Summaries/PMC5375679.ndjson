{"summary": "japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. it includes several other important human pathogens, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), yellow fever virus (YFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) activation of transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, NF-B, and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2)/c-Jun is induced by different pathways, leading to the expression of IFN-/ (11) viruses have developed strategies to counteract IFN induction and IFN-stimulated antiviral responses. NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, and NS4B were shown to inhibit STAT translocation to the nucleus and subsequent IFN-dependent reporter activity. NS5 of flaviviruses is known to play crucial roles in innate immune evasion. RESULTS JEV NS5 suppresses poly(IC)-induced IFN- production. expression of type I IFN can be induced by various stimuli, including poly(IC), a double-stranded homopolymer. expression levels of 500 ng and 1,000 ng of transfected plasmid were similar to those detected for NS5 in both plasmid-transfected and JEV-infected cells at 24 and 48 h postinfection. most of the NS5 protein in both plasmid-transfected and JEV-infected cells was detected in the cytoplasm. the expression levels of NS5 were determined at 36 h posttransfection and 24 h and 48 h postinfection by Western blotting. cells were transfected with pFlag-NS5 or infected with JEV at an MOI of 1.0. plasmid encoding JEV NS5 inhibits poly(IC)-induced activation of IRF3 and NF-B. cells were transfected with or without poly(IC) and incubated for another 12 h. cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Flag-NS5 or with an empty vector. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were either transfected with poly(IC) or left untreated. expression of NS5 did not affect levels of IRF3 and p65 in whole-cell lysate. western blot results revealed that poly(IC) induced the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the degradation of IB. however, expression of NS5 affected neither the level of IB nor the phosphorylation of IRF3. inhibition of IRF3 and NF-B activation was not due to alterations in upstream signaling molecules but directly due to the inhibition of NF-B nuclear translocation. cells were lysed and NF-B activity was determined by a dual-luciferase assay. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and NF-B activity was determined by a dual-luciferase assay. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the Flag-NS5 or Flag-NS5NLS plasmid. the cells were harvested and lysed at 36 h posttransfection. western blotting was performed with antibodies against c-Myc, Flag, IRF3 and p65. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding c-Myc-tagged NS5 or an NS5 mutant lacking the NLS (Flag-NS5NLS) no interaction between NS5 and importins was detected, suggesting that the interaction between NS5 and importins is NLS dependent. NS5 residues K391 and R394 are critical for its interactions with KPNAs. we coexpressed full-length NS5 or truncated NS5 lacking either bNLS (aa 321 to 370) or a/bNLS (aa 371 to 405). the results showed that KPNA proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with full-length NS5 and the mutant containing aa 371 to 405 HEK293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type NS5 plasmid (WT), NS5 mutant constructs (A to I), or vector plasmid (Vec.) and the KPNA2, or KPNA4 construct. the cells were harvested and lysed at 36 h posttransfection. Western blotting was performed with antibodies against c-Myc, Flag, and c-Myc. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restores the transcriptional activity of IRF3 and NF-B suppressed by JEV NS5. plasmid expressing NS5 or NS5-F mutant was cotransfected into HeLa cells. cells were left untreated or transfected with poly(IC) at 24 h posttransfection. protein levels of NS5, NS5-F, KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4 were determined by Western blotting. plasmid encoding KPNA3 or KPNA4 or empty vector was cotransfected into HeLa cells with the IRF3- or NF-B-dependent reporter system. twenty-four hours later, cells were mock infected or infected with JEV at an MOI of 1.0. and IRF3 (top) and NF-B (middle) activities were determined by a dual-luciferase assay. protein levels of NS5, NS5-F, KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4 were determined by Western blotting. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restored activity of IRF3 and NF-B. plasmid encoding NS5 or NS5-F or an empty vector was cotransfected. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restored expression of IFN- inhibited by NS5. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were left untreated or transfected with poly(IC) relative mRNA levels (top) and protein levels (middle) of IFN- were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. viral RNA levels and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. an apparent reduction in viral titer was observed for cells expressing KPNA3 or KPNA4. this suggests that overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 inhibits JEV propagation. expression levels of 500 ng and 1,000 ng of transfected plasmid were similar to those in plasmid-transfected and JEV-infected cells at 24 and 48 h postinfection. most of the NS5 protein in both plasmid-transfected and JEV-infected cells was detected in the cytoplasm. cells were transfected with increasing amounts (250 ng, 500 ng, and 1,000 ng) of plasmid encoding JEV NS5. expression levels of NS5 were determined at 36 h posttransfection and 24 h and 48 h postinfection. JEV NS5 inhibits poly(IC)-induced activation of IRF3 and NF-B. cells were transfected with or without poly(IC) and incubated for another 12 h. protein levels of NS5, IRF3 and p65 were quantified by immunoblot scanning. cytoplasmic proteins migrate to the nucleus and bind to the PRDI to PRDIII sites of the IFN- promoter to initiate IFN- transcription upon viral infection. cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Flag-NS5 or with an empty vector. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were either transfected with poly(IC) or left untreated. western blot results revealed that poly(IC) induced the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the degradation of IB. however, expression of NS5 affected neither the level of IB nor the phosphorylation of IRF3. inhibition of IRF3 and NF-B activation was not due to alterations in upstream signaling molecules but directly due to the inhibition of NF-B nuclear localization directly. plasmids expressing p50 and p65 were cotransfected into cells. cells were lysed and NF-B activity was determined by a dual-luciferase assay. NS5 competitively inhibits the interaction of IRF3 and p65 with KPNA3 and KPNA4. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with flag-NS5 or flag-NS5NLS plasmid. the cells were harvested and lysed at 36 h posttransfection. western blotting performed immunoprecipitation (IP) with whole-cell lysates. two NLSs (a/bNLS and bNLS; amino acids [aa] 320 to 405) identified in NS5 of DENV are highly conserved in other members of the flavivirus family. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding c-Myc-tagged KPNA1, KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4, or KPNA6. Western blotting revealed that smaller amounts of NS5 interacted with KPNA3 and KPNA4 in cells expressing larger amounts of NS5. NS5 residues K391 and R394 are critical for its interactions with KPNAs. NS5 mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with full-length NS5 and the mutant containing aa 371 to 405. hek293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type NS5 plasmid (WT), NS5 mutant constructs (A to I) and the KPNA2, or KPNA4 construct. the cells were harvested and lysed at 36 h posttransfection. hek293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type NS5 plasmid (WT), NS5 mutant constructs (F and J to M.) the cells were harvested and lysed at 36 h posttransfection. Western blotting was performed with antibodies against c-Myc, Flag, and GAPDH. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restores the transcriptional activity of IRF3 and NF-B suppressed by JEV NS5. plasmid expressing NS5 or NS5-F mutant was cotransfected into HeLa cells. cells were left untreated or transfected with poly(IC) at 24 h posttransfection. protein levels of NS5, NS5-F, KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4 were determined. plasmid encoding KPNA3 or KPNA4 or empty vector was cotransfected into HeLa cells with the IRF3- or NF-B-dependent reporter system. twenty-four hours later, cells were mock infected with JEV at an MOI of 1.0. the cells were collected after 12 h of incubation. the protein levels of NS5, NS5-F, KPNA2, KPNA3 and KPNA4 were determined by western blotting. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restored activity of IRF3 and NF-B. plasmid encoding NS5 or NS5-F or an empty vector was cotransfected. mRNA and protein levels of IFN- were determined. overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 restored expression of IFN-. cells were transfected or cotransfected with a plasmid encoding NS5 or NS5-F. after 12 h, relative mRNA levels (top) and protein levels (middle) of IFN- were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after infection. an apparent reduction in viral titer was observed for cells expressing KPNA3 or KPNA4. this suggests that overexpression of KPNA3 or KPNA4 inhibits JEV propagation. dsRNA is a potent intracellular signal that stimulates the defense responses of cells. many viruses have acquired sophisticated mechanisms to interfere with IRF3, NF-B, or AP-1 signaling. dsRNA activates IRF3, NF-B, and AP-1 signaling (7, 42) NF-B is rapidly activated after exposure to pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and various cytokines (41) in its inactive state, IB blocks the interaction of NF-B with the transport molecule importin. NS5 suppressed poly(IC)-stimulated NF-B activity but also the activity of overexpressed NF-B. NS5 of flavivirus plays multifunctional roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. two classical NLSs, a/bNLS and bNLS, are present within the interdomain region of DENV NS5. the role of conserved NLSs within the NS5 proteins of other flaviviruses is still unclear. the inhibition of nuclear-cytoplasmic protein transport is a strategy for JEV to prevent the antiviral response of host cells. however, our assay could not determine whether the enhancement of IRF3 and NF-B activation is the only mechanism regulating JEV replication. pFlag-NS5 proteins lacking NLS (pFlag-NS5NLS), bNLS (mut.1), and a/bNLS (mut.2) were generated by introducing deletions of amino acids 322 to 392, 321 to 370, and 371 to 392, respectively, using overlap extension PCR. rabbit polyclonal antibodies against KPNA1, KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4, KPNA5, KPNA6, KPNB1, KPNB2, p50, p65, IRF3, IB, and lamin A/C (Abclonal Technology); a mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated IRF3 (IRF3-p; Cell Signaling Technology); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse cells were transfected with 500 ng pFlag-NS5 or infected with JEV at an MOI of 1.0. at 24 h posttransfection/postinfection, cells were fixed and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) for 30 min. cells were stained with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) whole-cell lysates were generated by lysing cells in RIPA buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Bio-Rad). cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in DMEM containing 3% fetal bovine serum and 1.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. titers were calculated after 3 days of incubation. all experiments were repeated at least three times. pMyc-KPNA1, pMyc-KPNA2, pMyc-KPNA3, pMyc-KPNA5, and pMyc-KPNA6 were generated by cloning the open reading frame of each KPNA gene into pCMV-Tag1. monoclonal mouse anti-JEV NS5 was prepared in our laboratory. cells were cotransfected with empty vector or a plasmid encoding the indicated JEV or KPNA protein. twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with poly(IC) or infected with JEV. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) staining was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) at a magnification of 40. at 36 h posttransfection, cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) the level of each cDNA was determined by quantitative PCR using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo). expression data were normalized to the expression of -actin. Bonferroni posttest used for multiple comparisons."}
