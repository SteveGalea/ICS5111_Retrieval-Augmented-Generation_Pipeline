{"summary": "more than 150 HPV genotypes have been identified with different epithelial tropisms. the low-risk anogenital HPVs (such as HPV6, 11, 42) cause genital warts. the high-risk HPVs are associated with progression to carcinoma of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus and oropharynx. the exposed N-terminus of L2 is susceptible to protease cleavage. a major cross-neutralizing epitope located in amino acid 17 to 36 represents an attractive candidate antigen for broadly protective vaccination. the neutralizing titers produced by L2 vaccination are considerably lower than that induced by L1 VLP vaccination. fusing HPV16 L2 aa 17\u201336 epitope repeats to a recombinant ligand for FcRs (designated L2R4) could significantly increase the immunogenicity of the L2 peptide and induce cross-neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against a range of phylogenetically distant HPV types. the expression of E3R4 and E12R4 in culture medium was performed by reducing SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining (C), and Western blot (D) using RG-1 (15,000). 10 g of each L2R4 protein or 12 g of BSA was loaded (E) the L2R4 genes were codon optimized based on the codon usage bias in Sf9 cells (Sangon, Shanghai) the genes were subcloned into pFastBac1 vector and expressed as secreted proteins in baculovirus expression system. the expression and analysis of the recombinant proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE with coomassie blue staining and Western blot. groups of 2 rabbits were vaccinated subcutaneously on weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 with 4 nmol of E3R4 alone or with Alum (Sigma-Aldrich) and monophosphoryl lipid A (Sigma-Aldrich) adjuvant. sera were collected at weeks 6 and 8 and stored at -20\u00b0C. ELISA plates were coated with 100 ng of each protein (E3R4, E12R4, R4), or 5 ng (equivalent to the amount of the recombinant proteins on a mole basis) of E3 peptide at 4\u00b0C overnight. wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumen (BSA) in PBST at room temperature for 2 hours. titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with an OD 490 greater than 0.2 and 2-fold higher than control sera at the same dilution. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. mice were vaginally instilled with 0.4 mg of 5\u2032-F-Luciferin (CellCyto Life Sciences) three minutes later, luciferase signals were acquired for 5 min with a biofluorescence imaging (BFI) system of the LB 983 NightOWL II (Berthold Technologies) E3R4 and E12R4 proteins were purified from the culture supernatant by rProtein A sepharose affinity chromatography according to manufacturer's instructions. the expression and analysis of the recombinant proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining and Western blot with 15,000 dilution of RG-1. the purity of purified proteins was determined by Sf9 host cell protein (HCP ELISA as described previously the titer of PsV (infectious units per ml, IU/ml) was determined by GFP expression in 293TT cells as described in http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/lco/pseudovirusproduction.htm. each protein (e3R4, E12R4, R4), or 5 ng (equivalent to the amount of the recombinant proteins on a mole basis) of E3 peptide at 4\u00b0C overnight. wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumen (BSA) in PBST. RG-1 monoclonal antibody (13,000 dilution) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. significance was determined by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. se signals were acquired for 5 min with a biofluorescence imaging (BFI) system of the LB 983 NightOWL II (Berthold Technologies), and analyzed with IndiGO 2 software (Berthold Technologies). Statistical significance was determined by one-tailed unpaired t-test. results Preparation of L2R4 proteins We first examined expression of L2R4 proteins in the culture medium by SDS-PAGE since they are expressed as secreted proteins. a panel of HPV PsVs, including HPV16, 18, 45, 52, 58 (five common oncogenic types), HPV6, 11 (the most common types found in benign genital warts) were used to coat ELISA plates. the binding titers against each PsV type were significantly higher than E3 antisera (P0.001), suggesting that the R4 scaffold can enhance the immunogenicity of fused antigens. a 13,000 dilution of RG-1 was detected with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG. the binding titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with an OD 490 greater than 0.2 and 2-fold higher than control sera. a panel of PsVs encoding GFP from divergent HPVs were used in neutralization assays. cross-neutralizing antibody levels in the antisera after the third immunization of E3R4 or E12R4 were very low. the mean neutralizing antibody titers of the E3R4 antisera against HPV16, 52, 58, 6, 11, 18, 45 and 5 were 1040, 320, 360, 110, 110, 400, antisera were tested for in vitro neutralization titers against HPV16 (A), HPV18 (B), HPV45 (C), HPV52 (D), HPV58 (E), HPV6 (F), HPV11 (G) and HPV5 (H) pseudovirus. mice were immunized four times with E3R4, R4 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with CFA/IFA adjuvant. at eleven months after the first immunization, mice were intravaginally challenged with HPV16 (A), HPV45 (B), HPV52 (C), HPV58 (D), HPV11 (E), or HPV5 (F) pseudovirus. the neutralizing antibody titers of the two rabbits were 400 and 50 against HPV16, 50 and 25 against HPV18, 50 and less than 25 against HPV6. the neutralizing antibody titers against other PsV types were all below 25. antisera of two rabbits (nos. 1 and 2) were tested for cross-neutralization of eight HPV pseudovirus types. neutralization titers were determined as previously described [38], [39], [41]. a panel of HPV PsVs, including HPV16, 18, 45, 52, 58 (five common oncogenic types), HPV6, 11 (the most common types found in benign genital warts) and HPV5 (causes epidermodysplasia verruciformis) were used to coat ELISA plates. the binding titers against each PsV type in E3R4 and E12R4 antisera were significantly higher than E3 ELISA plates were coated with 100(E3R4, E12R4, R4), or 5 ng of E3 peptide. a 13,000 dilution of RG-1 was detected with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG. a panel of PsVs encoding GFP from divergent HPVs were used in neutralization assays. cross-neutralizing antibody responses in the antisera after the fourth immunization of E3R4 or E12R4 were very low. the mean neutralizing antibody titers of the E3R4 antisera against HPV16, 52, 58, 6, 11, 18, 45 and 5 were 1040, 320, 360, 110, 110, 400, Freunds adjuvanted E3R4 vaccine induces broad cross-neutralizing antibodies in mice. mice were immunized with E3R4 or R4 formulated with Freunds adjuvant for four times with 2-week intervals. mice were completely protected from challenge of PsV16. 0.05), PsV45 (Figure 5B, P 0.05), PsV52 (Figure 5C, P 0.05), PsV58 (Figure 5D, P 0.01), PsV11 (Figure 5E, P 0.01) and PsV5 (Figure 5F, P 0.05), whereas the mean luminescence signal in mice immunized with R4 scaffold was comparable to that in PBS control mice. neutralizing antibody titers against PsV16 and other PsV types were all below 25 in E3R4 alone antisera. the neutralizing antibody titers were 400 and 50 against HPV16, 50 and 25 against HPV18, 50 and less than 25 against HPV6. sera from mice immunized with a tandem repeat of HPV16 L2 aa 17\u201336 derived from 22 different HPV types with GPI-0100 adjuvant could neutralize HPV PsV types 16, 18, 45, but not types 6, 58 [43]. immunization of E3R4 with Freunds adjuvant elicited broad neutralizing antibody responses against HPV types 16, 18, 45, 52, 58, 6, 11 and 5 in mice. results also showed that the broadly protective immunity induced by E3R4 sustained at least 11 months after the first immunization. we think the enhanced immunity may result from targeted antigen delivery to APCs. previous studies have shown that the immunogenicity of HPV16 L2 aa17\u201336 (RG-1 epitope) is relatively low. in our study, we failed to detect neutralizing antibodies in the antisera from the mice immunized with E3R4 alone for four times. a concatenated multi-type L2 fusion protein was shown to elicit more broad neutralizing antibody responses than recombinant L2 derived from a single HPV type [43], we speculate that the vaccine potency can be enhanced if a stable L2R4 protein containing much more L2 epitopes from multiple HPV types is developed. unlike Freunds adjuvanted E3R4 immunization in mice, Alum-MPL adjuvanted E3R4 immunization only induced low-titers of neutralizing antibodies against HPV16, 18 and 6. lum-MPL adjuvanted RG1-VLP, which uses papillomavirus VLP as a platform to display the RG-1epitope [25]. theoretically, there are up to 360 copies of RG-1 epitope are surface exposed per chimeric RG1-VLP, while only 6 copies of RG-1 epitope are surface exposed per E3R4 protein."}
