{"summary": "in 2001, letters containing anthrax were mailed to individuals in the united states. a microbiology student in Singapore contracted SARS due to lapses in biosafety protocols and procedures. in 2011, there was an outbreak of 109 cases of Salmonella typhimurium in the US linked to clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. in 2009, the human pathogens and toxins Act (the Act) (4) received royal assent. the purpose of the Act is to establish an oversight system to protect the health and safety of the public against the risks posed by human pathogens and toxins. the new licencing framework provides oversight of controlled activities with human pathogens and toxin. it outlines the powers and functions as well as qualifications of a biological safety officer. a requirement for every person responsible for activities with human pathogens and toxins listed in Schedule 5 to be registered with the Agency. four types of licences will be issued depending on the nature and risk of the human pathogens or toxins activities in use. compliance with the Canadian Biosafety Standard (6) will be a common licence condition. individuals with pathogens and toxins above the trigger quantity will require a security clearance in accordance with the Act. four types of licences will be issued depending on the nature and risk of the human pathogens or toxins activities in use. a licence holder (or the person who has been issued a licence under the Act) will be required to report to the Agency various events such as laboratory exposures/laboratoryacquired infections, inadvertent possession or production, gain of function (5). this requirement in the Act aims to increase timeliness, accuracy and usefulness of information on laboratory exposures and laboratory-acquired infection that occur in licensed facilities across Canada. Previously, laboratory exposure and laboratory-acquired infection reporting was carried out on an ad-hoc and voluntary basis in Canada. the exposure notification report is to be submitted as soon as reasonably possible and consists of preliminary information about the nature of the incident and the pathogen or toxin involved. the national incident reporting system will be shared with stakeholders across the laboratory community of practice via an annual report on aggregate national trends. the information generated from the national incident reporting system will be shared with stakeholders across the laboratory community of practice. this report will summarize key findings on exposure and laboratory-acquired infections and investigation findings. the best and most innovative science at Canadian universities and research institutions. and maintaining a competitive edge for Canadian companies."}
