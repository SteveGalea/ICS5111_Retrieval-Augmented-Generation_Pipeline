{"summary": "a community-based dataset was collected from the Safe and Dignified Burials program in western area. the data contain GPS locations of where the bodies of 200 dead who tested positive for Ebola were collected. age, sex, time of burial and symptom onset time were also recorded. Fig. 2 shows a clear asymmetry in the average number of \u201coffspring\u201d at the individual level, quantifying the impact of superspreading. the epidemic growth appeared to be fueled mostly by only a few superspreaders. a few superspreaders ( 3% of all cases) were responsible, either directly or indirectly, for a substantial proportion of all of the cases generated. a majority of the infections could have been prevented if the superspreaders were identified and quarantined promptly. superspreaders may be crucial to sustaining and fueling epidemic growth. most cases did not spread, and superspreading was nonsignificant. Fig. 3B shows that most of the transmission occurred over relatively short distances. in Fig. 4A, as expected, the infectious period had a clear positive relationship with mean offspring number. this covariate cannot be used as a predictor of superspreading, because it is not known a priori. a significant difference in instantaneous infectious hazard exerted by different age groups constitutes a key driver of superspreading. Fig. 5A shows that superspreading should have been even more prominent in the presence of underreporting compared with our estimate. underreporting appears to have limited effect on the estimated R 0, at least up to underreporting rate of 80%. the study period is divided into nine equal intervals. each interval takes an underreporting rate that is 10% lower than the previous one. our model assumed an isotropic spatial dispersal (Materials and Methods) in scenario 1 (base scenario), we assumed an isotropic dispersal and did not take into account the potential effect of population density. we also tested alternative parameterization of priors in Table S3. d R 0 Dispersion parameter, k E x p o n e n t i a l (baseline) 10.9 2.39 0.37 W e i b u l l 10.3 2.39 0.40 G a m m a 10.43 2.40 0.38 The mean of generation time, R0, and the dispersion parameter k that quantifies superspreading are shown. the mean of infectious period (i.e., duration from symptoms onset to death/burial) was estimated to be 3.9 d [3.75, 4.0]. both estimates were lower than that estimated from cases detected within the clinical care system. this could highlight systematic differences between community-based cases and cases notified in clinical care systems. an observational study in which k was estimated to be 0.16 (10, 11) suggests that our estimate of the degree of superspreading may be conservative. this discrepancy in the estimate suggests that our estimate of the degree of superspreading may be conservative. infected individuals are direct and indirect descendants of the first five superspreaders. superspreading becomes relatively more important over time (i.e., within 100 d after the epidemic peak) superspreading becomes relatively more important over time (i.e., within 100 d after the epidemic peak) superspreading in EBOV was evident and may be partly attributed to unsafe burial practice during the early stage of the outbreak (14), other drivers remain unclear. despite the clear relationship between infectious period and magnitude of superspreading, this covariate cannot be used as a predictor. underreporting is a ubiquitous feature of epidemiological data (17, 18) in this section, we explore the effect of underreporting on our analysis under two probable scenarios. all unreported cases were circulating in the community and not hospitalized. es of k. bars represent the 95% C.I., and dots represent the median values. at each underreporting rate, 10 independent simulations and corresponding inference were performed. assuming an isotropic dispersal may have slightly biased towards the longer transmission distance (Fig. S2C) the effects were nonsignificant, mainly due to relatively homogeneous population density where the cases resided. the raw grid resolution is 100 m 100 m (which is too fine to display) table S1.
