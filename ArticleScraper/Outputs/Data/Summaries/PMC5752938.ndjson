{"summary": "in the lung, PRRSV exploits alveolar macrophages (AM) for its replication, triggering a massive infiltration of the alveolar septa by macrophages. in the absence of secondary bacterial infections, pneumonias caused by PRRSV are rarely lethal and begin to resolve within 2 weeks. pigs afflicted by PRRSV have abundant presence of IFN- and TNF- in lung tissue. the mechanism responsible for this condition is unclear (16) the modulation of cytokine production in AM-infected AM involves the actions of two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor proteins, namely protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) to cope with ER stress and maintain protein homeostasis, cells initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which comprises the activation of PERK, IRE1 phosphorylation of eIF2 occurring late in infection was associated with inhibited production of IFN- and TNF-. early in the infection, IRE1 promoted the activation of NF-B and enhanced TNF- production stimulated by LPS. early in the infection, IRE1 was abolished by an inhibitor of the kinase activity of IRE. 73% of the cells exhibited evidence of cytopathic effect (CPE) by 12 hpi, 80% of the cells were GFP+ and the majority also exhibited membrane blebs. at this time, approximately 15% of the cells also exhibited the presence of membrane blebs, suggesting that such cells were in the early stages of apoptosis. arrows identify cells exhibiting membrane blebs. at 12 hpi, cell viability was determined by trypan blue (TB) exclusion. PRRSV in ZMAC cells was completed within a 12- to 16-h period. the kinetics of IFN- and TNF- responses of porcine AM was examined. a half-maximal response was reached at approximately 6 h after stimulation. the results represent the means standard deviations of three independent experiments for each agonist. ZMAC cells were either mock treated or exposed to poly(IC) (25 g/ml) for 1 h. their whole-cell lysates were harvested at the time points indicated. FN- production, exposure of ZMAC cells to poly(IC) resulted in strong production of IFN-. exposure of the cells to PRRSV strain NADC20 failed to elicit production of the cytokine. presence of live virus required for this event to occur. infection of AM with PRRSV inhibits neither the activation of IRF3 or STAT1 nor the transcription of IFNA1, IFNB1 and IFNA1 genes induced by stimulation with poly(IC) NS indicates lack of statistical significance. whole-cell lysates were obtained and analyzed to sequentially detect p-IRF3, IRF3, and -actin (A) or p-STAT1, STAT1, and -actin (B) as a control, replicate cell sets were mock infected and cultured for 5 h before an additional 1-h incubation in the presence or absence of poly(IC) V-mediated inhibition of IFN- production observed in virus-infected ZMAC cells stimulated with poly(IC) appeared to occur following the activation of IRF3 and STAT1. a possible effect on the transcription of genes whose products are involved in type I IFN induction was assessed. expression of the IFNA1 gene in uninfected, untreated cells was not detected. cells exposed to poly(IC) for 1 or 4 h showed similar small amounts of IFNA1 mRNA. by 7 h poststimulation, the amounts of IFNA1 mRNA had increased 4- to 5-fold regardless of the presence or absence of virus infection. the synthetic analog of dsRNA, poly(IC), is recognized by at least two types of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5) and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) localized in endosomes. the detection by cytosolic sensors is apparently best achieved by the forced delivery of the molecule by way of transfection. stimulation of cytosolic or endosomal sensors by dsRNA appears to do so without inhibiting the activation of IRF3. infection of AM with PRRSV does not inhibit the activation of IRF3 induced by transfection with poly(IC) despite the inhibition of IFN- production. asterisks indicate statistical significance (**, P 0.01) in mock-infected cultures stimulated with poly(IC) the asterisks indicate statistical significance (**, P 0.01). infected AM with PRRSV triggers the unfolded protein response. p-IRE1 is a transmembrane protein kinase that under ER stress conditions dimerizes and autophosphorylates, favoring the phosphorylation of eIF2. p-PERK could be detected in the PRRSV-infected AM as early as 3 hpi and increased gradually over the next 6 h. a switch from prosurvival to proapoptotic signals can occur, resulting in apoptotic death of damaged cells. the expression of CHOP is low under nonstressed conditions, but its expression markedly increases in response to ER stress through IRE1-, PERK-, and ATF6-dependent transcriptional induction. negative- and positive-control cell lysates were prepared from mock-infected cells cultured for 8 h or cultured for 2 h in the presence of the ER stress-inducing chemical DTT. whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p-eIF2 and total eIF2. phosphorylation eIF2 should cause the accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes that would associate with RNA binding proteins to create stress granules (SGs) at 4 hpi, the percentage of TIAR+ cells (3.8%) was comparable to that observed in the uninfected, untreated cells (3.5%) dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) became phosphorylated at either 2, 5, or 8 hpi. repressed ability of PRRSV-infected AM to produce IFN- in response to synthetic dsRNA coincides with timing of eIF2 phosphorylation induced by virus infection. infected with P129-GFP virus were probed for the presence of GFP, eIF2 and p-eIF2. the presence of p-eIF2 increased over time. the presence of p-eIF2 became evident at 10 hpi despite the presence of p-eIF2. lysates were prepared from virus-infected (B and E) and mock-infected (C and F) cell cultures and proved by Western blotting for p-eIF2 and total eIF2. the statistical comparisons were made between the amounts of cytokine present in the supernatants from mock-infected versus virus-infected cultures stimulated with poly(IC) two time points after virus infection, 2 and 6 h, were selected to stimulate the cells with LPS. compared to the amount of TNF- released by mock-infected AM cultures stimulated with LPS at 2 hpi, a 1.7-fold increase of the cytokine was measured 2 and 4 h later. cytokine present in supernatants from infected versus mock-infected cultures stimulated with LPS are indicated with asterisks (**, P 0.01). Whole-cell lysates obtained at indicated times postinfection were analyzed by Western blotting for p-NF-B, total NF-B, and -actin. phosphorylated version of this molecule was detectable in PRRSV-infected AM as early as 2 h after infection repressed production of TNF- exhibited by PRRSV-infected AM stimulated with LPS occurred only when the cells were exposed to the TLR4 agonist at 6 hpi. this event occurred without impairing the activation of NF-B-p65 by LPS. a marked inhibition of TNF- production was observed in AM stimulated with LPS at either 2 or 6 h after the initiation of the virus infection. phosphorylation status of eIF2 in lysates obtained from cells stimulated with LPS at 6 hpi and cultured for 2 h. only scarcely detectable levels of p-eIF2 were present in lysates of cells that had been infected with either strain of PRRSV for only 2 h before being stimulated with LPS and harvested 2 h later, at 4 hpi. asterisks indicate statistical significance (**, P 0.01). compared with mock-infected cultures stimulated with LPS. PERK inhibitor (PERKi) GSK2606414 (46) infected AM for either 4 or 6 h prior to their exposure to PERKi. the presence of PERKi diminished the PRRSV-mediated inhibition of IFN- production by almost half, to 28%. the presence of PERKi during the infection did not affect PRRSV replication (Fig. 11D) western blotting for p-eIF2 and eIF2 and the densities of the resulting bands were used to calculate the relative amounts of eIF2 phosphorylation (p-eIF2/eIF2) the results of two experiments are shown. ZMAC cells were either mock infected or infected with PRRSV for 2 h prior to a 5-h incubation in the absence or presence of GSK2606414. the titer of infectious virus (TCID50 per milliliter) was determined. the IRE1-NF-B signaling pathway is involved in the synergistic TNF- response of PRRSV-infected AM to LPS. stimulation of AM with LPS at 2 hpi resulted in TNF- production. the inclusion of the IRE1 kinase inhibitor KIRA6 in the virus-infected AM cultures resulted in inhibition of the phosphorylation of NF-B-p65. in macrophages, the early-phase activation of NF-B in response to signaling through TLR4 by LPS occurs via an alternate entity, namely the intracellular adaptor protein MyD88 (50) whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p-NF-B and total NF-B. the densities of the bands were used to calculate the relative amounts of NF-B phosphorylation (p-NF-B/NF-B) the presence of a synergistic TNF- response caused by the interaction between PRRSV and LPS was determined. the presence of a synergistic effect was assessed by analyzing the data in a two-way analysis of variance (51). this analysis revealed the presence of a statistically significant (P = 0.03) synergistic effect between the virus infection and the TLR4 agonist in eliciting a TNF- response. the synergistic TNF- response of virus-infected AM stimulated by LPS was abolished. at 4 h postinfection, 1% of the infected ZMAC cells exhibited green fluorescence. at 8 hpi, clear evidence of GFP expression was observed in 73% of the cells. by 12 hpi, 80% of the cells were GFP+, and the majority also exhibited the presence of membrane blebs. ZMAC cells were infected with the GFP-expressing PRRSV strain P129-GFP (MOI = 5) at the indicated times postinfection, a sample of the overlying medium was removed and the titer of infectious virus was determined. in virus titer at 4 hpi, there was a 104-fold increase by 8 hpi and a subsequent 20-fold increase 4 to 6 h later. the replication cycle of PRRSV in ZMAC cells was completed within a 12- to 16-h period, similar to the reported 12-h period required for the same process to occur in primary PAM (33). ZMAC cells were stimulated with poly(IC) (25 g/ml) (A) or LPS (100 ng/ml) (C), and the amount of IFN- (A) or TNF- (C) present in cell-free culture supernatant at the indicated time after stimulation was determined by ELISA. the results represent the means standard deviation of three independent experiments for each agonist. exposure of AM with PRRSV failed to stimulate IFN- and inhibits their ability to produce IFN- in response to stimulation with poly(IC). exposure of the cells to PRRSV strain NADC20 failed to elicit production of the cytokine (Fig. 3B) asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (**, P 0.01) between the cytokine present in infected versus mock-infected cultures stimulated with poly(IC) NS indicates lack of statistical significance. infection of AM with PRRSV inhibits neither the activation of IRF3 or STAT1 nor the transcription of IFNA1, IFNB1 and IFNA1 genes induced by stimulation with synthetic dsRNA. ZMAC cells were mock infected or infected with either PRRSV strain FL12 or NADC20 (MOI = 5) and stimulated with poly(IC) (25 g/ml) at the indicated times postinfection. whole-cell lysates were obtained and analyzed to sequentially detect p-IRF3, IRF3, and -actin (A) or p-STAT1, STAT1 and -actin (B) as a control, replicate cell the asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (*, P 0.05) the PRRSV-mediated inhibition of IFN- production observed in virus-infected ZMAC cells stimulated with poly(IC) appeared to occur subsequent to the activation of IRF3 and STAT1. expression of the IFNA1 gene in uninfected, untreated cells was not detected. cells exposed to poly(IC) for 1 or 4 h exhibited similar small amounts of IFNA1 mRNA. by 7 h poststimulation, the amounts of IFNA1 mRNA had increased 4- to 5-fold regardless of the presence or absence of virus infection. gene occurred at 7 h after stimulation with the agonist and corresponded to 9 h after the initiation of the virus infection. the reduced synthesis of IFN- observed in virus-infected AM occurs after the positive-feedback loop of type I IFN is operational. infection of AM with PRRSV does not inhibit activation of IFN- induced by transfection with poly(IC) despite the inhibition of IFN- production. at 2 hpi, the cells were exposed to poly(IC) either by transfection (400 ng/ml) or in free form (25 g/ml) ELISA determined the amounts of the cytokine present in cells-free supernatants. asterisks indicate statistical significance (**, P 0.01) infected cultures. PRRSV-infected AM showed a relatively low-level expression of phosphorylated IRE1 (p-IRE1). exposure of AM to the same chemical reduced p-IRE1 below the level exhibited by untreated or DTT-treated cells. p-IRE1 is a transmembrane protein kinase that under ER stress conditions dimerizes and autophosphorylates. p-eIF2 (p-eIF2) was either undetected or present in small amounts in mock-infected cells. it became detectable by 6 h after virus infection and gradually increased for the next 6 h. expression of CHOP is low under nonstressed conditions, but its expression markedly increases in response to ER stress. whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p-PERK and -actin. negative- and positive-control cell lysates were prepared from mock-infected cells cultured for 8 h or cultured for 2 h in the presence of the ER stress-inducing chemical. negative- and positive-control cell lysates were prepared from mock-treated cells. infection of AM with PRRSV induces stress granule formation. phosphorylation eIF2 should cause accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) became phosphorylated at either 2, 5, or 8 hpi. results indicate that the observed phosphorylation of eIF2 in PRRSV-infected AM does not appear to be mediated via the action of PKR. lysates of ZMAC cells (A to C) or primary PAM (D to F) infected with P129-GFP virus were probed for the presence of GFP, eIF2 and p-eIF2. the presence of p-eIF2 increased over time. these results indicate that PRRSV mRNAs are resistant to translational attenuation mediated by p-eIF2. whole-cell lysates were prepared from virus-infected (B and E) and mock-infected (C and F) cell cultures and proved by Western blotting for p-eIF2 and total eIF2. asterisks indicate statistical significance (**, P 0.01; *, P 0.05). with PRRSV on the production of the cytokine became manifest by >6 h after virus infection. the response to this agonist has faster kinetics, resulting in half-maximal TNF- production within 3 h after stimulation. the infection of AM with PRRSV triggers negligible production of the cytokine. the data shown are the means SD of a representative of three independent experiments. differences between the amounts of cytokine present in supernatants from infected versus mock-infected cultures stimulated with LPS are indicated with asterisks. lysates obtained from mock-infected cells stimulated with LPS. the effect of PRRSV infection on the production of TNF- and IFN- responses occurred only when the cells were exposed to the TLR4 agonist at 6 hpi. this event occurred without impairing the activation of NF-B-p65. a marked inhibition of TNF- production was observed in AM infected with either of two different strains of PRRSV (FL12 or NADC20) for 6 h before being exposed to LPS and then cultured for 2 h. in contrast, only scarcely detectable levels of p-eIF2 were present in the lysates of cells that had been infected with either strain of PRRSV. the presence of p-eIF2 and total eIF2 in whole-cell lysates was assessed. additional replicate sets were mock infected and cultured for 2 h before an additional 2- or 1-h incubation in the presence of LPS or DTT. the presence of PERKi diminished the PRRSV-mediated inhibition of IFN- production by almost half, to 28% compared to 51% in its absence. the presence of PERKi during the infection did not affect PRRSV replication. whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p-eIF2 and eIF2. the densities of the bands were used to calculate the relative amounts of eIF2 phosphorylation (p-eIF2/eIF2) results of two experiments are shown. a sample of the overlying medium was removed and the titer of infectious virus was determined. the IRE1-NF-B signaling pathway is involved in the synergistic TNF- response of PRRSV-infected AM to LPS. stimulation of AM with LPS at 2 hpi resulted in TNF- production that was 1.5-fold greater than the response generated by identically stimulated mock-infected cells. the inclusion of IRE1 kinase inhibitor KIRA6 in the virus-infected AM cultures resulted in inhibition of the phosphorylation of NF-B-p65. in macrophages, the early-phase activation of NF-B occurs via an alternate entity, namely the intracellular adaptor protein MyD88 (50) IRE1-NF-B signaling pathway involved in synergistic TNF- response of PRRSV-infected AM to LPS. whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p-NF-B and total NF-B phosphorylation (p-NF-B/NF-B) the amount of TNF- produced by AM stimulated with LPS at 2 h was again found to be greater (approximately 30%) than that produced by mock-infected cells that were treated only with LPS and cultured for the same length of time. we examined the influence of PRRSV infection on the signaling pathway for type I IFN- production in the context of PRRSV infection of its natural host cell. the novel contribution of our work is the analysis of the inhibitory effect of PRRSV on IFN- synthesis in the context of PRRSV infection. a mechanism responsible for the inhibited production of IFN- in virus-infected AM. it should influence the late-phase type I IFN- signaling pathway. it should not involve the inhibition of transcriptional events necessary for cytokine production. kine production occurs only when the virus-infected cells are exposed to the TLR4 agonist at 6 hpi. the bulk of the TNF- synthesis coincides with the time at which there is an ample supply of phosphorylated eIF2 in the virus-infected cells. this occurs between 2 and 4 h after stimulation and corresponds to 8 to 10 hpi. the poly(IC)-induced synthesis of IFN- by porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells infected with PRRSV was found to be curtailed posttranscriptionally. the mechanism was not examined but proposed that it could occur via translation inhibition (57). translation of coronavirus mRNA in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2 has been shown to occur in cells infected with MHV (62) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (63) possible mechanisms include the extreme abundance of viral mRNA, which could counterbalance effects of translational attenuation. in macrophages undergoing chemically induced ER stress, activation of IRE1 amplifies TNF- production in response to LPS (47) alterations in regulatory mechanisms can trigger macrophage-directed immune overreactions resulting in lung immunopathology (70) PRRSV sensitizes the lung to respond with enhanced pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine production and severe respiratory disease upon exposure to LPS (10). the enhanced TNF- response of AM to LPS during the early stages of PRRSV infection suggests that the activation of the stress sensor IRE1 by PRRSV infection results in a functional reprogramming of AM activity toward a proinflammatory phenotype. the porcine AM cell line was derived from the lungs of porcine fetuses. primary PAM was obtained from the lavage fluid from lungs harvested from euthanized specific-pathogen-free pigs. the cell pellets were washed twice with Hanks' buffered sterile saline (HBSS) and suspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) ibco, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1 nonessential amino acids were kept at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. maintenance of ZMAC cells also required the inclusion of 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor. posed viruses to produce CPE in monolayers of MARC-145 cells. infected cells were infected with PRRSV strain NADC20 at an MOI of 5. after 1 h of infection at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed twice. the cell cultures were also treated with either 1 M the IRE1 inhibitor KIRA6 (41) (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) or 1 to 2 M the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 (46). the wells were coated with 50 l of 2.5-g/ml anti-pig TNF- MAb. the optical densities at 450 nm (OD450s) of triplicate wells were averaged. the lowest levels of detection for the IFN- and TNF- assays were 80 pg/ml and 120 pg/ml. the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with one of the following unconjugated primary Abs. the membranes were then washed four times in TBST solution and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) secondary Ab. samples of 105 uninfected or PRRSV-infected ZMAC cells were cultured at RT for 15 min. each sample was lysed in buffer RLT, and the total RNAs were purified. the total RNAs were purified, DNase treated, converted into cDNA. monolayers were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, washed with PBS, incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% normal goat serum) for 1 h at RT, and incubated in MAb dilution buffer (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. after being washed 3 an unpaired Student's t test was used to determine if significant differences existed in the cytokine gene expression or synthesis exhibited by AM between treatment groups. the interaction effects between PRRSV, LPS, and the IRE1 inhibitor were tested using two-way ANOVA (51). Hanks' buffered sterile saline (HBSS) and suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) both PAM and ZMAC cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (Mediatec, Herndon, VA, USA) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 nonessential amino acids. ixanol was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 64,100 g at 4\u00b0C for 3 h. purified virus stocks were titrated in monolayers of ZMAC cells. the occurrence of cellular DNA fragmentation, indicative of late stages of apoptosis, was detected by TUNEL using the DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL system (Promega, Madison, WI) for cytokine responses, uninfected or PRRSV-infected cells cultured as described above were treated at the indicated times postinfection. individual IFN--secreting cells and presence of IFN- in cell-free culture supernatants were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for TNF- detection, the same procedure was followed except that the wells were coated with 50 l of anti-pig TNF- monoclonal antibody (MAb) lysates were incubated in blocking buffer (2% fish gelatin in TBST solution, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20) the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with one of the following unconjugated primary Abs (a 1:1,000 dilution of manufacturer's original concentration in TBST with 5% BSA) membranes were washed four times in TBST solution and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) secondary Ab. the membranes were then incubated with a chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, CA, USA) to enable detection of bound secondary Ab. RNA preparation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR were performed. a total of 2 105 ZMAC cells were grown in individual wells of a Nunc LabTekII 8-well chamber slide. the cells were either mock infected for 8 h, treated with DTT for 1 h, or infected with PRRSV strain FL12 (MOI = 5) for 4 or 8 h. after being washed 3 times with PBS, the cells were incubated at RT in blocking buffer for 1 h. clonal antibody (1:200 dilution of manufacturer's original concentration; cloneJ2; Scicons, Szir\u00e1k, Hungary) for 2 h, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with Ab dilution buffer containing 2.5 g/ml goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at RT for 1 h."}
