{"summary": "a novel pathogenic coronavirus emerged in 2012 in the Middle East. the devastating outbreak of EBOV infections in three west africa countries in 2013 signaled a new stage in the emergence of this highly pathogenic virus. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) rapidly spread throughout much of the Americas in 2013 to 2014 and then Zika virus (ZIKV) did so in 2015 to 2016. a new tetravalent vaccine for treatment of dengue virus (DENV) infections provides a degree of protective immunity against infections by DENV type 1 (DENV-1) through DENV-4. this vaccine provides a degree of protective immunity against infections by DENV type 1 (DENV-1) through DENV-4 by inclusion of all four serotypes on chimeric attenuated yellow fever virus backbones. flaviviruses consist of 180 premembrane (prM) and 180 envelope (E) proteins that associate to give a total of 60 trimeric spikes on an immature virus. prM acts as a chaperone, sitting over the fusion loop of E and preventing premature triggering. this gave rise to a potent pan-serotype MAb that neutralizes all four serotypes with reduced virus-enhancing activity compared to the parental antibody. the use of ab513 is therapeutically effective in animal models of DENV pathogenesis. antibodies targeting the fusion loop epitope (FLE) are generally cross-reactive. a cross-neutralizing antibody, 2A10G6, can neutralize ZIKV. the structure of ZIKV E protein in complex with 2A10G6 indicates that the antibody binds to immature or partially immature virus particles. a panel of mouse MAbs with broad specificity against multiple alphaviruses were recently identified (14). these cross-reactive MAbs bind to a conserved epitope on E2 domain B and cause conformational rearrangements that reposition E2 domain A. this led to broad inhibition of multiple alphaviruses by the panel. NEXT-GENERATION FILOVIRUS IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS Besides flaviviruses, another major focus of emerging virus research is humoral responses to EBOV and other filoviruses. many descriptions of potent neutralizing MAbs and effective immunogens for invoking protective responses have been published. GP requires proteolytic activity of pH-dependent host cell proteases in order to remove the glycosylated membrane distal domain and expose the RBS. GP requires proteolytic activity of pH-dependent host cell proteases in order to remove the glycosylated membrane distal domain and expose the RBS. this unusual mechanism of exposing the RBS within endosomes likely helps protect the virus from neutralizing antibodies targeting this conserved region. a panel of human and mouse MAbs targeting CHIKV-infected cells revealed a block to membrane curvature formation by cross-linking MAbs. this led to the arrest of assembled nucleocapsid cores beneath the plasma membrane. this mechanism is different from previously reported mechanisms seen with antibodies able to block viral egress. two nonneutralizing marburg virus glycoprotein-specific MAbs have been reported to prevent virus release by inducing aggregation of progeny virus particles at the cell surface (24). it will be interesting to discover how CHIKV NAbs targeting different domains cross-link glycoprotein at the plasma membrane in order to disrupt the critical glycoprotein organization required for membrane bending."}
