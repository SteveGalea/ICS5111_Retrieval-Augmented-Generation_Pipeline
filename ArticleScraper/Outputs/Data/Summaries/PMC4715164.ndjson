{"summary": "a novel lineage C betacoronavirus the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. the subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in various countries in the Middle East has led to the hypothesis that these animals may be the reservoir for MERS-CoV. a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA was developed in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of a dromedary dairy herd in Dubai after sudden death. there were no adult male dromedaries in the herd and mating was human-assisted. microplates were pre-coated with the first anti-MERS-CoV-recombinant N protein monoclonal antibody 1F6. the plate was shaken for 2 min and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. 100 L of the anti-MERS-CoV antibody 7C4 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added. detection was carried out by adding 100 L of tetramethylbenzidine per well. MERS-CoV isolates from nasal swabs were grown on vero cells. samples were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 1 h. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps was constructed using PhyML v3.0, based on complete concatenated coding sequences of 68 available human MERS-CoV and 18 camel MERS-CoV genomes. nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences of each coding sequence were aligned using MAFFT version 7.37 Unique mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions at the coding sequences were revealed microplates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were pre-coated with the first anti-MERS-CoV-recombinant N protein monoclonal antibody 1F6. the plate was shaken for 2 min and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. 50 L of each well was added to the wells in duplicate. superscript III one-step RT-PCR system with Invitrogen Platinum Taq Polymerase. contains 0.4 mM of each dNTP and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate. 1 g of non-acetylated bovine serum albumin. MERS-CoV IgG antibody detection All serum samples were tested using Euroimmun ELISA (Euroimmun AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) samples were applied at a 1:101 dilution and incubated in the wells of microtiter strips coated with the purified spike protein subdomain S1 antigen of MERS-CoV. a ratio of >1.0 was considered to be positive. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps was constructed using the cause of death was cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. the nasal sample, but not trachea, lung, and tonsil samples collected from the dromedary calf were positive for the N protein. the milk produced by the 133 female adult dromedaries were all negative for the N protein, real-time qRT-PCR, and virus isolation. the MERS-CoV strain from the present study is shown in blue, those from eastern and western Saudi Arabia are in magenta and green. other strains from the united arab Emirates are in orange, and those from the recent Korean outbreak are in purple. blue arrows indicate unique mutations in the camel MERS-CoV genome. cause of death was cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. nasal sample, but not trachea, lung, and tonsil samples collected from dromedary calf were positive for the N protein, real-time qRT-PCR and virus isolation. nasal swab of the dromedary calf with sudden death showed that this MERS-CoV strain did not cluster with the other MERS-CoV strains from Dubai that we reported recently. instead, it formed a unique branch more closely related to other MERS-CoV strains from patients in the recent Korean outbreak, in which the index patient acquired infection during travel in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. three were found in the S1 domain of the spike protein (S28P, S459T, and P710S), and one each was found the proteins encoded by ORF4b, ORF5, the envelope gene and ORF8. blue arrows indicate unique mutations observed in the camel MERS-CoV genome. the dromedaries in this study belonged to a closed herd that did not have contact with other herds because they were browsing in a confined area. it is believed that the virus could be circulating in the herd, which was probably infected in Saudi Arabia several years ago when the dams were calves. we argue that the ELISA may be used in animal field studies. the study showed a concordance with those obtained from nucleic acid detection using dromedary nasal samples."}
