{"summary": "traditional chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the rarely existing traditional medicines that hold systematic theories as well as preventative and therapeutic methods for diseases in practice. systematic reviews have become the standard approach in assessing and summarizing primary studies. systematic reviews have become the standard approach in assessing and summarizing primary studies. the aim of this study is to validate the reliability and external validity of AMSTAR by applying it to a sample of TCM systematic reviews. a systematic review is a review of a clearly formulated question, that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant researches. a search strategy for locating systematic reviews on TCM was formulated by using the definitions. the OQAQ scale measures across a continuum using nine questions (items 1\u20139) designed to assess various aspects of the methodological quality of systematic reviews. the tenth item requires assessors to assign an overall quality score on a seven-point scale. we adopted the Kappa values of 0 rates as less than chance agreement. 0.01\u20130.20 as slight agreement, 0.21\u20130.40 as fair agreement. 0.41\u20130.60 as moderate agreement, 0.61\u20130.80 as substantial agreement. systematic review is a review of a clearly formulated question. it uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant researches. a search strategy for locating systematic reviews on TCM was formulated by using the definitions. two assessors performed a separate translation and conducted a pilot test independently. each translator prepared a separate translation and the difficulty in obtaining conceptually equivalent expressions in Chinese was assessed too. the final Chinese versions of AMSTAR and OQAQ were then developed for formally evaluating methodological quality of systematic reviews. 0 rates as less than chance agreement, 0.01\u20130.20 as slight agreement, 0.41\u20130.60 as moderate agreement, 0.61\u20130.80 as substantial agreement, and 0.81\u20130.99 as almost perfect agreement [8]. compared AMSTAR, OQAQ, and a self-developed global assessment scale. the overall mean scores (mean of two assessors) were taken to verify the construct validity of AMSTAR. random sample with 41 TCM systematic reviews was selected from a database developed in a previous study. the sample included 35 paper-based reviews and 6 Cochrane reviews; there was only one updated Cochrane review. the topics of the reviews ranged across 9 systems. the self-developed 100-point rating scale ranged from 15 to 73 with a mean of 47.6 (95% CI: 43.4, 51.7). agreements on item 5 and item 9 were mild at a percentage of less than 60%. the highly agreements in four items ranged from 80% to 95%. 85.4 (70.8\u201394.4) 0.70 (0.49, 0.91) (3) Was a comprehensive literature search performed. 87.8 (73.8\u201395.9) 0.75 (0.55, 0.95) (4) Was the status of publication (i.e., grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion\" 48.8 (32.9\u201364.9) 0.16 (0.03, 0.30) (7) Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented\" ICC for AMSTAR against OQAQ was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93). both overall scores were converted into the percentage of maximum score. ICC obtained when comparing AMSTAR with the item 10 in OQAQ was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.91), and ICC was at 0.81 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.90) a linear regression analysis was performed (time = 6.35 + 2.94 langrage + 1.75 log(pages), P 0.001) the time needed to complete using AMSTAR had significant associations with logarithm of the number of pages (unstandardized coefficients = 1.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 2.90) and langrage (unstandardized coefficients = 2.94, 95% CI: 0.73 to 5.15) items 5 (list of included and excluded studies) and 9 (appropriate method to combine studies) scored relative low either in agreement percentage or in kappa parameter. agreement percentage was inferior to AMSTAR, with a mean percentage of 79% (95% CI: 64%, 89.5%), and the mean of kappa was relatively low too. the interobserver ICC to the total score was excellent for AMSTAR at 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91), and superior to OQAQ, 0.67 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.82). ICC obtained when comparing AMSTAR with the item 10 in OQAQ was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.91), and when comparing with the 100-point rating scale, ICC was at 0.81 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.90). reviews published after 2005 had similar AMSTAR scores compared to earlier reviews (5.98 1.51 versus 6.18 1.76, P = 0.70) the results showed there was a statistical association between AMSTAR score and the number of pages. the results showed there was a statistical association between AMSTAR score and the number of pages (Spearman's rho = 0.67, P 0.001). the AMSTAR showed satisfactory interrater agreement, convergent validity, and feasibility in assessing methodological quality of TCM systematic reviews. overall agreement and kappa of items in AMSTAR ranged from moderate to perfect, the reliability of its total score was excellent. the AMSTAR revealed Cochrane systematic reviews have higher quality scores than non-Cochrane systematic reviews. compared with the results reported by Shea et al., considerable differences exist on ICC for AMSTAR contrast to the OQAQ, or on items with relatively low kappa values. possible explanations for these differences include (i) the different samples of systematic reviews being evaluated, most SRs in our sample were short, published in Chinese. AMSTAR proved to be feasible to apply in quality assessment of TCM systematic reviews. the main problems emerged were the absence of guidance for certain item response, such as item 5 \u201cwas a list of studies (included and excluded) provided\u201d to get \u201cyes\u201d score. the current Chinese version should be translated back into English by a third party. the back translations would be compared with the original tools. but the absence of back translation may offset somewhat in present study by a check of accuracy with a previous Chinese version of two instruments tools [10]"}
