{"summary": "human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is a pathogenic DNA virus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and the B cell malignancies primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), which often occur in immunocompromised individuals. successful virus replication is in large part achieved by the ability of viruses to counteract antiviral responses of the host cells. mitochondria play a central role in antiviral signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and innate immunity (9\u201312). proapoptotic proteins, such as BOPs, are elevated and/or activated during virus replication. proapoptotic proteins, such as BOPs, are activated during virus replication. vIRF-1 is recruited to mitochondrial lipid raft-like microdomains. vIRF-1 interacts with mDRM via the vIRF-1 N-terminal region. vIRF-1 inhibits MAVS aggregation, which is essential for its antiviral activity. vBcl-2 was obtained from lytic BCBL-1 cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Flag. vIRF-1 and MAVS short

activity over the Renilla luciferase activity. vIRF-1 localizes to the mitochondria by targeting to mDRM. previously, we found that vIRF-1 localized to the mitochondria in HHV-8-infected cells and inhibited BOP-induced apoptosis (6). vIRF-1 was only partially solubilized, even with 1% SDS at room temperature, while prohibitin and Bax were fully solubilized. vIRF-1 was detected in one major peak, which comigrated with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a marker of mDRM. each fraction was collected and immunoblotted with antibodies to vIRF-1 and mDRM-localized voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) each fraction was collected and immunoblotted with antibodies to vIRF-1 and mDRM-localized voltage-dependent anion channel 1. each fraction was collected and immunoblotted with antibodies to vIRF-1 and mDRM-localized voltage-dependent anion channel 1. mitochondrial localization of vIRF-1 involves integration of the PD region into mDRM. each of 18 blocks of 25 amino acids (aa) was deleted from the N-terminal end of vIRF-1. mDRM fractions and total cell extracts derived from 293T cells transfected with Flag-tagged full-length vIRF-1 (FL) or 18 deletion mutants were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. the vIRF-1 PD has sequence homology with PINK1 MTS. we compared the primary protein structure of vIRF-1 PD with that of other mDRM-targeted proteins using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. cleavage is consistent with previous reports that PINK1 is cleaved at two potential residues, residues 35 and 77, presumably by a mitochondrial processing peptidase (28). the sequences for mDRM targeting are conserved between vIRF-1 and PINK1. vIRF-1 PD has sequence similarity with cellular mDRM-targeting proteins. an mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells transfected with vIRF-1 PD or MTS-tagged PD constructs. the indicated MTSs were fused to the N-terminal region of vIRF-1 PD. cytochrome c, and TOM20 were used as loading controls. the expanded PD protein did not interact with all of the phosphatidylinositol lipids. vIRF-1 binds directly to externalized CL via the PD or its expanded domain. the expanded PD (1 to 153) and PD (1 to 75) bound to CL. IRF-1 expanded PD (aa 1 to 153)-GFP proteins and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody. recombinant GFP or GFP-fused vIRF-1 PD or expanded PD proteins (2 M) were added to CL immobilized. an mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells transfected with constructs carrying GFP-fused vIRF-1 expanded PD (1 to 151) with intact or mutated CBD. an mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells transfected with constructs carrying intact or mutated CBD. MAVS is known to localize to other subcellular organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrion-associated ER membranes (ER membranes) however, no significant amounts of their respective markers, calregulin, ACSL4, and catalase, were detected in our mitochondrial preparation. mitochondrial soluble factor cytochrome c was not detected in mDRM, while VDAC1 was detected in mDRM. mDRM was decreased in MAVS KO 293T cells, as in BCBL-1 cells. MAVS targeting to mDRM during HHV-8 replication-induced mDRM targeting of vIRF-1. mitochondria were incubated with or without 1 g/ml of doxycycline. an mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells transfected with vIRF-1. the relative band intensities of mitochondrial vIRF-1 in the detergent soluble (S) and insoluble (P) fractions normalized by total vIRF-1 (T) were shown in the graph. mDRM targeting of vIRF-1 PD was only marginally increased by MAVS compared to targeting of vIRF-1 FL. vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM is dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and CL externalization induced by MAVS. rat anti-Flag (L5)-Alexa Fluor 647, mouse anti-TOM20-Alexa Fluor 488, and rabbit anti-catalase-Alexa Fluor 555 (A) or ACSL4-Alexa Fluor 555 (B) antibodies were generated using Element software. the images in rectangles with white line are shown in the next images. 293T cells were transfected with vIRF-1 with or without MAVS for 24 h. the cells were immunostained with anti-Flag (green) and vIRF-1 (purple) the cells were immunostained with anti-Flag (green) and vIRF-1 (purple) and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. mDRM targeting of vIRF-1 is likely mediated by mROS. we developed a method by which exposed CL in the OMM can be assessed quantitatively by determining the level of human anti-CL antibody bound to the mitochondria using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. vIRF-1 interacts with MAVS and inhibits MAVS aggregation. recently, it was reported that MAVS may play an inhibitory role in HHV-8 productive replication (15) but previously showed that vIRF-1 has an opposite effect, that is, promotion of HHV-8 productive replication (7). BCBL-1 TRE:RTA cells were treated with 1 g/ml of DOX or mock treated for 1 day. total cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-vIRF-1 antibody. asterisks indicate heavy chain of IgG used for immunoprecipitation. vIRF-1-positive (+) cells were immunostained with antibodies to vIRF-1 and MAVS. a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed with RIPA buffer-soluble extracts derived from 293T MAVS/ cells transfected with full-length versions of Flag-MAVS together with vIRF-1. a fraction (15%) of the vIRF-1-positive (+) BCBL-1 cells at 24 h postinduction showed a lower intensity of MAVS fluorescence or less MAVS aggregation than did neighboring vIRF-1-negative () cells. this population was increased more than 2-fold (15% to 34%) after 48 h of DOX treatment. vIRF-1 remained active in inhibition of p53- or SMAD3-mediated transactivation. vIRF-1 and vIRF-1 NLSX could inhibit the IFN- transactivation by a constitutively active form of RIG-I (RIG-I) that leads to MAVS activation. vBcl-2 was not as effective as vIRF-1 for inhibition of apoptosis. vIRF-1 inhibits MAVS-mediated antiviral signalings. vIRF-1 inhibits MAVS-mediated antiviral signalings. vIRF-1 inhibition of RIG-I-induced apoptotic signaling. 293 cells were transfected with GFP or RIG-I-GFP. vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM is important for HHV-8 productive replication. vIRF-1 inhibition of p53- and SMAD3-mediated transactivations suggests the effects of PD deletion were related to deficient MAVS inhibition specifically. 293T cells were cotransfected with control or vIRF-1 shRNAs along with control or vIRF-1 shRNAs. total cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Flag, Myc, and -actin antibodies. vIRF-1 localized to the mitochondria in HHV-8-infected cells. mitochondrial localization of vIRF-1 was not dependent on its interaction with BOPs. mitochondrial localization of vIRF-1 was not dependent on its interaction with BOPs. vIRF-1 was detected in one major peak, which comigrated with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) the term mDRM is used to refer to the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet fraction. vIRF-1 localizes to mitochondria by targeting to mDRM. which blocks of 25 residues were deleted from vIRF-1 and examined their detergent solubilities in mitochondria. each of the first three blocks, encompassing the proline-rich domain (PD), significantly reduced detection of vIRF-1 in mDRM. the protein levels of flotillin-1 (FLOT1), which was used as a loading control and a mDRM marker, remained constant. each of 18 blocks of 25 amino acids (aa) was deleted from the N-terminal end of vIRF-1. mDRM fractions and total cell extracts derived from 293T cells transfected with flag-tagged full-length vIRF-1 (FL) or 18 deletion mutants were immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies. PINK1, also known as PARK6, is a mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase involved in mitochondrial quality control. so far, the mDRM targeting region of PINK1 has not been defined precisely. in vitro mitochondrial binding assay showed that a PD-GFP mutant in which the GQRP motif was mutated to AQAA could not localize to the mitochondria. vIRF-1 PD has sequence similarity with cellular mDRM-targeting proteins. in vitro mitochondria pulldown assay was performed with purified recombinant GFP, PD-GFP, and PD (GxRPX)-GFP proteins. \u2018GxRPX\u2019 indicates the mutation of the GxRP motif to AxAA. vIRF-1 binds to membrane lipids, including cardiolipin. the expanded PD protein did not interact with all of the phosphatidylinositol lipids. the expanded PD protein was of the most interest because it is enriched in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) vIRF-1 binds directly to externalized CL via the PD or its expanded domain. ELISA-based analysis of CL binding of vIRF-1 PD. recombinant GFP or GFP-fused vIRF-1 PD or expanded PD (1 to 153) proteins were added to CL immobilized on a 96-well plate. cholesterol is a major constituent of lipid rafts and comprises 1 to 4% of mitochondrial membrane lipids. therefore, it is likely that cholesterol may be involved in stable mDRM targeting of vIRF-1 in addition to CL. by inspection of the expanded PD sequences, we identified the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus. mitochondrial soluble factor cytochrome c was not detected in mDRM. mitochondrial soluble factor c was not detected in mDRM, while VDAC1 was detected in mDRM. results suggest MAVS may have an effect on vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM. the mitochondria of BCBL-1 TRE:RTA cells incubated with or without 1 g/ml of doxycycline (DOX) for 2 days were isolated on a self-generating Percoll gradient. the mitochondria were incubated in TNE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells transfected with vIRF-1. mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells. mDRM targeting assay was performed with 293T cells. vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM is dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and CL externalization induced by MAVS. we investigated if vIRF-1 localizes to these subcellular organelles upon virus infection. 293T cells were transfected with or without MAVS for 24 h. then incubated with 5 M MitoSOX red reagent in HBSS buffer for 10 min. cells were immunostained with anti-Flag antibody (green) and nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) 293T cells were transfected with vIRF-1 with or without MAVS for 24 h. the cells were immunostained with anti-Flag (green) and vIRF-1 (purple) and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. we then developed a method by which exposed CL can be assessed quantitatively by determining the level of human anti-CL antibody bound to the mitochondria. HHV-8 reactivation enhanced CL exposure on the mitochondria. but MitoQ inhibited CL exposure. vIRF-1 interacts with MAVS and inhibits MAVS aggregation. vIRF-1 promotes vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM during HHV-8 replication. vIRF-1 interacted with MAVS in the DRM fraction of transfected 293T cells. vIRF-1 interacted with MAVS in the DRM fraction of transfected 293T cells. total cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-vIRF-1 antibody. the immunoprecipitates and lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies. the asterisks indicate heavy chain of IgG used for immunoprecipitation. of 150 vIRF-1 (+) cells from 50 randomly selected microscopic fields (60) were compared with those of the neighboring vIRF-1 negative () cells. a fraction (15%) of the vIRF-1-positive (+) BCBL-1 cells at 24 h postinduction exhibited a lower intensity of MAVS fluorescence or less MA. vIRF-1 blocks MAVS-induced antiviral signaling. vIRF-1 blocks MAVS-induced antiviral signaling. vIRF-1 blocks MAVS-induced antiviral signaling. vIRF-1 and vIRF-1 NLSX could inhibit the IFN- transactivation by a constitutively active form of RIG-I (RIG-I) that leads to MAVS activation. vIRF-1 had a more protective effect than wild-type vIRF-1, contrary to their relative inhibitory effects on IFN- transactivation. vIRF-1 inhibits MAVS-mediated antiviral signalings. vIRF-1 inhibits MAVS-mediated antiviral signalings. vIRF-1 inhibition of MAVS-induced cell death. vIRF-1 targeting to mDRM is important for HHV-8 replication. first, we generated a single lentiviral vector specifying both vIRF-1 or control shRNAs and vIRF-1R variants. we observed that vIRF-1 depletion reduced HHV-8 productive replication. vIRF-1 shRNA and vIRF-1R variants resistant to vIRF-1 shRNA. 293T cells were cotransfected with control or vIRF-1 shRNAs. total cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Flag, Myc, and -actin antibodies. viral proteases such as hepatitis C virus NS3/4A, hepatitis A virus 3ABC and enterovirus 71 protease 2Apro cleave MAVS to dislocate the functional domain of MAVS from the mitochondria. however, there is no previous evidence that viral gene products are recruited by MAVS to the mitochondria and mediate negative-feedback control during virus replication. lipids, such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and sulfatide, are constituents of lipid rafts and found in the mitochondrial membranes (46\u201348), suggesting that stable mDRM targeting of vIRF-1 could be mediated by multiple regions. despite disagreement on the presence of mDRM (49), there is compelling experimental evidence supporting their existence. the molecular mechanism by which MAVS is activated by HHV-8 replication is unknown. however, it is clear that MAVS plays an inhibitory role in HHV-8 replication (15). these results will extend our understanding of viral mechanisms countering MAVS-activated innate immunity."}
