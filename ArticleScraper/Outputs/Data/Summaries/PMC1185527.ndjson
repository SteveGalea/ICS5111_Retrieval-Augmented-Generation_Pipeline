{"summary": "rodent and primate pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) gene families have expanded independently from a common ancestor. however, it is unknown whether multiple paralogs have been selected for diversification of function, or for increased dosage of monofunctional PSG. we compared them to rat, human and baboon PSGs to attempt to understand the evolution of this complex gene family. gene family expansion, coupled with local diversification of the CFG face, suggests selection both for increased gene dosage and diversification of function. partial conservation of RGD and RGD-like tri-peptides in primate and rodent N and N1 domains, respectively, supports a role for these motifs in PSG function. human and mouse PSGs contain one V-like Ig domain (N), C2-like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C), with domain arrangements classified as type I (N-A1-A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C), type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) if human RGD motifs are functionally significant, there has been diversification of function of some human, and all mouse, PSGs, relative to a putative RGD-containing ancestor. this might reflect co-evolution of PSGs and their receptor pairs, similar to the co-evolution of ligand / receptor pairs observed in host-pathogen interactions [19,20]. Mean Dayhoff PAM250 log scores were calculated for each alignment position and grouped by domain. scores within each of the four domains were then visualised using box and whisker plots. there was no evidence of interspecies conservation of the other domains. novel rat PSG N1 domains identified by database searches were identified in NCBI and Ensembl databases. p 0.0001 were observed for the N/N1 domain comparison when tested against the A1/N2 and A2/N3 data, and p 0.0005 when tested against the B2/A data. split decomposition analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in rat PSG N1 domain alignments, compared to mouse. it is not possible to accurately determine branch points in an evolutionary tree of human PSGs. this information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees. split decomposition analysis was performed using the SplitsTree4 program [24] on the individual domain exons of mouse Psg genes. we detected no conflicting signals for mouse Psg N1 domain exons (Fig. 2A), in contrast to the human N domain exons (Fig. 2B) scale bars represent 0.01 (A) or 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site (B, C, D). baboon PSG N domain exons showed significant conflicting signals. phylogenetic analysis indicates interspecific amino-terminal N domain conservation. tree was generated from ClustalX alignments of nucleotide sequences. tree bootstrapping 1000 times to test reliability of branches. phylogeny of all known mouse and human PSG N, A and B domain nucleotide sequences. scale bar represents 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. the CFG face of CEACAM N domains has been shown to interact with pathogens and mammalian proteins (Fig. 7B) there is considerable variation between mouse N1 domains. positive Dayhoff scores and generally low standard deviation indicate good conservation of mouse PSG N1 domains. line and N domain amino acid numbering commences from the first amino acid of the mature N domain. Alignment of CEACAM N domains (minus signal sequences) showing all N domain interactions with pathogens and known binding partners. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for scores at each residue position. regions representing the CFG face are boxed (1\u20133) and an RGD-like motif is indicated. other specified amino acids are denoted by the single letter code. the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dn) was calculated using the method of Yang and Neilson [46] for pairwise nucleotide comparisons. the N1, N2 and N3 domains of mouse PSGs (mN1, mN2 and mN3) comprised individual data sets that were analysed in the following comparisons. otides present in the three sections comprising the CFG face were separated from those comprising the ABED face. a plot of dn vs ds for the ABED face of the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains demonstrates a distribution of pairwise-alignment data points which lie below the line of equivalence. similar plot generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points distributed approximately equally on both sides of the line of equival the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (ds) was calculated using the method of Yang and Neilson [46] for pairwise nucleotide comparisons. the 45\u00b0 line of equivalence is drawn where dn = ds. data derived from sets of rat N1 CFG and ABED faces were also analysed. the font size used for each tri-peptide motif represents relative abundance among the PSG proteins. motifs and codon sequences in grey type are intermediates that have not been observed in vivo. the most commonly represented tri-group is 4-2-5, with 27% representation. this tri-group is not RGD-like and its representation is lower than the mean maximal tri-group representation of 49.8 22.7% determined for fifty random alignment positions. but when the mouse N1 domain is aligned with the human N domain, the most commonly represented tri-group is the RGD-like 5-1-4 group which has 59% representation. scores determined by ClustalX alignment of full-length mouse PSGs with full-length human PSGs. mouse Psg24, Psg30 and Psg31 along with human PSG2 and PSG5 were omitted from the analysis due to expansion or contraction of total domain complement. all rat PSG genes were found to reside on contig NW_047556. this was used for the prediction of remaining exons for each PSG gene based on BLAST generated alignments with mouse Psg gene sequences. split decomposition analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in rat PSG N1 domain alignments compared to mouse. split decomposition analysis identifies contradictory relationships within alignment data. this information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees. we detected no conflicting signals for mouse Psg N1 domain exons. however, our results for human N1 domains differ from those obtained by McLenachan et al. [22] because we observed only two contradictions. scale bars represent 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site. analysis of the mouse N2 domains indicates numerous contradictions in the alignments of the Psg24, Psg29, Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 group. the human and baboon N sequences formed one distinct cluster. the mouse and rat N1 sequences formed a second and the mouse N3 domains formed a fourth. of particular interest was the split between the ancestral N-type domain and the common ancestor of the N2 and N3 domains. data were bootstrapped 1000 times and all major branches yielded values of 95\u2013100%. scale bar represents 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. rat and rat PSG gene coding sequences were analysed. dayhoff score analysis using comparisons of all mouse N1 domain versus all human N domain ClustalX aligned sequences gives an indication of the general pattern of evolution of these domains since the rodent / primate divergence. the majority of residues exhibit good conservation, and relatively little variability is observed between pair-wise comparisons. the dayhoff PAM250 log score was determined for pairwise comparisons of each sequence in the mouse set against all the others in the set. regions representing the CFG face are boxed (1\u20133) and an RGD-like motif is indicated. other specified amino acids are denoted by the single letter code. SG genes (rN1) and the N domain exons of human PSG genes (hN) were analysed in the following comparisons: mN1 vs mN2; mN1 vs mN3; mN2 vs mN3; mN1 vs mN3; mN1 vs rN1; mN1 vs hN. box and whisker plots were generated from mN1 vs mN2; mN1 vs mN3; mN2 vs mN3; mN1 vs rN1; mN1 vs hN. dn/ds calculated from pairwise comparisons of all sequences in one dataset against all sequences in the other dataset. significant differences of p 0.0001 were observed between all comparisons except intra-mouse comparisons. a similar plot generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points distributed approximately equally on both sides of the line of equivalence. this is due predominately to a higher number of non-synonymous substitutions. the values obtained for the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domain CFG faces equal or exceed 1.0, with the highest median value of 1.1 observed in the rat N1 domain. data derived from sets of rat N1 CFG and ABED faces were also analysed. '***' is p 0.0001 (calculated by the Mann-Whitney method) evidence of conservation of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs in mouse N1 domains. 53% of aligned mouse PSG N1 domain exon sequences possess a tri-peptide at the site of the RGD-like 5-1-4 tri-group. the control value obtained was 67.6 22.9%. the most commonly represented tri-group is 4-2-5, with 27% representation. group representation of 60.7 20.4%. Discussion We recently collated the full-length coding sequences of the entire mouse Psg gene family. we aimed to identify evolutionary signals embedded in Psg gene and PSG protein sequences to determine whether PSG protein function diverged between the rodent and primate lineages. the greatest effect was observed in the N1 domain exon with a doubling of the dn/ds ratio in the CFG face compared with the ABED face. the increase in the dn/ds ratio appears to be due to an increase in the dn value, indicative of diversification. the rat N1 domain CFG face does not appear to have evolved as rapidly as the mouse, with a dn/ds ratio of 0.9. a peptide containing the RGD motif from the human PSG9 N domain binds to a receptor on a promonocytic cell line suggesting that some human PSGs may effect their functions through an integrin-type receptor [18]. the high frequency of the RGD motif on an exposed loop in primate PSG N domains (seven of ten in human and five of fifteen in baboon) may be significant. the conservation of RGD-like motifs exclusively in the N1 domain may have functional significance. we note that the RGE motif in the context of the POEM protein induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro. we speculate that certain RGE or RGE-like motifs may elicit weak cell attachment, followed by apoptosis. a search pattern was developed and used to interrogate the Rattus_norvegicus.RGSC3.1.nov.dna_rm.contig.fa.gz archive obtained from the Ensembl FTP resource [36]. the search pattern was derived manually from alignments of amino acid sequences from the N domain exon of all known mouse and rat PSGs (mouse PSG16-PSG32 and rat PSG36-PSG40) phylogenic analysis Mouse PSG sequences were obtained from McLellan et al. [41], rat PSG sequences were obtained as described. human PSG sequences were obtained as described. baboon N1 domain sequences were obtained as described. the mean and standard deviation of scores obtained for the pairwise comparisons at each site were determined to give an indication of the general level of conservation and variability at the site. sites where gaps were present in any of the sequences were not analysed were not analysed. based on amino acid properties of the residues in the motif where group 1 contains G, A, S, T; group 2: V, L, I, M; group 3: F, Y, W; group 4: arginine is in group 5, glycine is in group 1, and aspartate is in group 4. tri-group 5-1-4 is 'RGD-like' in terms of the biochemical properties of the constituent amino acids. ClustalX alignments were produced using the complete open reading frames returned by the program combined with the N1 domains of rat PSG36-PSG40. alignments were trimmed to include only N1 domain exon sequence and a Neighbour-Joining tree was generated using MEGA version 2.1 software [40] to aid the identification of new sequences. s of amino acids encoded at each site within alignments Multiple alignments of either one set (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 domain exons only) or two sets (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 and N2 domain exons) of amino acid sequences were produced using ClustalX. analysis of tri-peptide amino acid property groupings A perl program was written to analyse ClustalX alignments of mouse and human PSG N domain exons. alignments were inspected and modified where necessary. additional file 2 A rich text format file containing the Clustal W amino acid sequence multialignment of PSG N1, N2 and N3 domains. the RGD-like motif is boxed for comparison between domains."}
