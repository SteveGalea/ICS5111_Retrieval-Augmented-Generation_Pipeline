{"summary": "we characterize the transmissibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (hereafter pH1N1) in south africa during 2009 by estimating the serial interval (SI), the initial effective reproductive number (initial Rt) and the temporal variation of Rt. results 12,360 confirmed pH1N1 cases were reported in the central registry. a rapid and timely estimation of the transmission parameters of this novel virus played an important role in informing transmission potential and mitigation interventions during the 2009 pandemic period. the post-pandemic documentation of these parameters is equally important as many previous estimates were established from analyses conducted during early stages of epidemics. a variation in Rt with progression of the pandemic was observed in Mexico, averaging at 1.47 (based on a negative binomial model) in a previous work, we estimated the SAR and SI of pH1N1 among the first 100 cases detected in South Africa by prospectively examining virus transmission between household contacts. testing was performed by accredited laboratories including the national Influenza Centre (NICD-NHLS), NHLS public-sector laboratories or private-sector laboratories. all testing laboratories performed detection and characterisation of pH1N1 virus by real-time PCR by either the protocol developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza. the parameters were estimated using three methods: Method 1 We make use of the likelihood-based method for the simultaneous estimation of initial Rt and the SI described by white and pagano (2008). the method is well suited for estimation of initial Rt and the SI in real-time with observed aggregated daily counts of new cases. we assume that the number of infectees generated by infectors with symptoms on day j follows a Poisson distribution with parameter RtNj. method 3 We make use of the wallinga and Teunis\u2019 method for estimation of Rt from the imputed data [26]. the method calculates the relative probability a case on day i infects a case on day j as: where pk is the probability of a serial interval of length k. for all estimates, we calculate bootstrap confidence intervals as has been described previously. NICD maintains a central registry of all pH1N1 laboratory-confirmed cases detected throughout the country. tests performed by accredited laboratories including: the national influenza centre (NICD-NHLS), NHLS public-sector laboratories or private-sector laboratories. all testing laboratories performed detection and characterisation of pH1N1 virus by real-time PCR. estimates of initial Rt and temporal variation in Rt were based on date of symptoms onset (observed and imputed) the parameters were estimated using three methods: Method 1 We make use of the likelihood-based method for the simultaneous estimation of initial Rt and the SI described by white and pagano (2008) [25]. method 2 We assume a known distribution of the SI in south africa. we estimate the initial Rt using the maximum likelihood estimator for known SI described by white and pagano (2008). method 2 uses the daily case counts of cases and assumes serial interval is known. all estimates, we calculate bootstrap confidence intervals as has been described previously [9], [26]. we combine the results from all 100 imputations to obtain a confidence interval that incorporates both imputation error, as well as random error [27]. Method 1 We make use of the likelihood-based method for the simultaneous estimation of initial Rt and the SI in real-time with observed aggregated daily counts of new cases. Method 2 We assume a known distribution of the SI in south africa. we estimate the initial Rt using the maximum likelihood estimator for known SI described by white and pagano (2008) [9], [25]. Method 3 We make use of the Wallinga and Teunis\u2019 method for estimation of Rt from the imputed data. data on date of symptom onset was available for 758 (6%) cases and date of specimen collection for 12,500 (99%) cases. the first case reported illness onset of June 12, 2009 and the epidemic peaked on week 32 (August 3\u20139, 2009) lag-time between date of symptom onset and date of specimen collection, incidence rate ratio (IRR) and significance value of covariates significant in the Poisson regression model. estimates ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.21\u20131.48) to 1.54 (95% CI: 1.37\u20132.03) when the maximum value of the SI ranged from 4 to 8 days. vals We first utilised the SI established from the aforementioned field investigations of the initial 100 cases in estimating Rt, as described in method 2. when performing the analysis using the SI distribution observed for both confirmed and suspected secondary cases, we found an initial of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.38\u20131.49). data and Imputation 12,630 laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases were captured by the south africa central registry during 2009. data on date of symptom onset was available for 758 (6%) cases and date of specimen collection for 12,500 (99%) cases. estimates ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.21\u20131.48) to 1.54 (95% CI: 1.37\u20132.03) estimates ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.21\u20131.48) to 1.54 (95% CI: 1.37\u20132.03) when the maximum value of the SI ranged from 4 to 8 days. first utilised the SI established from the aforementioned field investigations of the initial 100 cases in estimating Rt. when performing the analysis using the SI distribution observed for both confirmed and suspected secondary cases, we found an initial of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.38\u20131.49). initial Rt estimates established using likelihood-based method for simultaneous estimation of Rt and SI are in agreement with field findings. previous estimates of initial Rt and the mean SI for pH1N1 have ranged between 1.3\u20132.9 and 2.5\u20133.3 days. a separate analysis predicted a slightly lower SI of 3.3 in community settings and a SI of 3.81 in confined settings during the 1918 pandemic. the overall transmissibility of pH1N1 in south africa during 2009 was more similar to that of seasonal influenza strains than the 1918 pandemic. however, after less than 2 months of heightened transmission, dropped below 1 corresponding to a decline in the incidence of new cases. data for this study are derived from laboratory-based surveillance data from several regions across south africa; a large and diverse country. despite these limitations, the post-pandemic estimates add to the body of knowledge of pH1N1 transmissibility parameters."}
