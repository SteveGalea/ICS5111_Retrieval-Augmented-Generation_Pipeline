{"summary": "viral loads evaluated in nasal washes in vivo were not significantly different among children and adults with asthma compared to nonasthmatic individuals with acute rhinitis during infections with rhinovirus. findings suggest that the asthmatic airway may be more susceptible to rhinovirus infection, more permissive of increased viral replication, and defective in viral clearance. children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, or oncologic disorders were not enrolled. informed consent was obtained from parents and informed assent was obtained from children 7 years of age or older. cDNA was extracted from nasal washes and reversed-transcribed as previously described (2). the resulting cDNA was used for viral identification and RV load assessments at the university of Wisconsin-Madison. experimental infections with RV-16 Subjects included 16 with mild, physician-diagnosed asthma, all with positive methacholine and negative prick skin tests. eight subjects without asthma, all with negative methacholine and negative prick skin tests, were included as control subjects. children enrolled included 28 who required treatment with at least a nebulized 2 agonist for wheezing heard by a physician on auscultation; 32 with acute rhinitis (onset of symptoms 4 d), and 14 without respiratory tract signs or symptoms. most of the wheezing children, 41% of those with acute rhinitis, and 57% of control subjects were enrolled in the emergency room. sera with greater than or equal to 0.35 IU/ml of IgE Ab to any of the allergens tested were considered positive for sensitization. sICAM-1, IFN-1, and ECP in nasal wash concentrations were measured in nasal washes by ELISA. cDNA was generated as previously described (21) using Qiamp RNA isolation kits (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) the cDNA was amplified using primers and probes specific for conserve regions of RV. the PCR mix consisted of iQ 2X supermix (BioRad, Uppsala, Sweden) binary cross-sectional outcome variables were analyzed by exact logistic regression. a Bonferroni type I error adjustment was used for multiple test comparisons pertaining to a single outcome variable. a Bonferroni type I error adjustment was used for multiple test comparisons relating to a single outcome variable. between-group comparisons of the mean cumulative outcome values were formulated by linear contrasts of the least squares means. heezing and Acute Rhinitis compared to Control Subjects (n = 28) Mean age, yr 8.9 10.5 11.8 Age range, yr 4\u201318 4\u201318 5\u201318 Male, % 64* 34 64 Race/ethnicity, % W/AA/H/O 21/64/4/10 41/50/6/3 64/36/0/0 Medicaid,1 % 61 (23) 85 (26) 44 (9) Previous history for wheezing, the number of children with data available is shown in parenthesis. 2 Percentage of children reporting symptoms of atopic dermatitis, or food allergy, conjunctivitis, or persistent or seasonal rhinitis. 4 Percentage of children exposed to tobacco smoke from one or more individuals living at home.
