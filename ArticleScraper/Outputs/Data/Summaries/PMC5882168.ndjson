{"summary": "voluntary swine disease control programs emerged in north America in the early 2000\u2019s. these programs have been widely used for monitoring and surveillance of diseases of economic importance to swine producers. swine industry often reports PRRS as a seasonal disease. time-series analysis is a field in development, and has not been explored for modelling of infectious diseases in food animal production systems. the main objective of this study was to use time-series analysis to describe temporal patterns of PRRS at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. only swine herds that contributed with complete data from those previously mentioned years were enrolled in this study. data were aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds that were considered as having an active outbreak each week. farms would be allocated to that category as soon as outbreaks were identified and reported by herd veterinarians. data from a total of 388 weeks were available for analysis (2009\u20132016) data were stratified at the state level and separately analyzed. the five states examined included Minnesota (MN), Iowa (IA), North Carolina (NC), Nebraska (NE), and Illinois (IL). data were aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds that were considered having an active outbreak each week. farms would be allocated to that category as soon as outbreaks were identified and reported by herd veterinarians and based on a number of features. once herds reported an outbreak, they were considered \u2018status 1\u2019 or \u2018positive unstable\u2019 following AASV PRRS classification guidelines. data from a total of 388 weeks were available for analysis (2009\u20132016) data were stratified at the state level and separately analyzed. the five states examined included Minnesota (MN), Iowa (IA), North Carolina (NC), Nebraska (NE), and Illinois (IL). the majority of participating farms were located in the swine dense regions of Minnesota and Iowa. Fig 1 depicts the prevalence, upper and lower 95% confidence intervals (grey dotted lines) of farms containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. the best ARIMA models according to our selection criteria are provided on Table 2. There was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. a fall/ winter seasonal pattern was only detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. 0.09 0.11 AIC = 1263.94 Iowa (1,0,0) Xt = 13.43 + 0.05t \u2013 1.94 cos (2t/52) \u2013 6.75 sin (2t/52) + 0.65 cos (2t/26) + 1.95 sin (2t/26) + Yt s.e. 0.61 0.62 0.37 0.37 Yt = 0.90Yt-1 s.e. 0.02 AIC = 1296.44 North Carolina (1,1,1) Xt swine industry has a lot of opportunities for the pathogens to spread via non-obvious manner. the presence of an alternating trend for all examined states within the u.s., except for the state of Iowa, which had an increasing linear trend. swine industry has a lot of opportunities to spread via non-obvious manner. the period between May 2013 and late March 2014 coincided with the calendar year in which the U.S. had a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak [21, 22]. despite the fact that an unpredictable event occurred in the population examined here, our data were not considered robust enough for division into testing and training and potential prediction. this is the disease that causes the most far-reaching impact to the swine industry of the country. this was the best available method for classifying swine herds in regards to PRRS at the present time. if this misclassification occurred, it would be consistent across farms, which we believe would dramatically change our conclusions. the current work will serve as basis for establishing a disease baseline by region."}
