{"summary": "angiotensinogen is broken down by renin to give angiotensin I (Ang I), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II) in the kidneys, the ACE-Ang II type 1 axis promotes sodium and water retention, oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, cell proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I (Ang I) the main function of ACE2 is to synthesize inactive Ang 1-9 from Ang I. Ang I acts a substrate for neprilysin, which cleaves it to form Ang 1-7 from Ang II. glomerulopathy Humans ND ND - Lely et al[34] 2004 IgA nephropathy Humans Mizuiri et al[36] 2011 Hypertension Rats ND ND 1 Prieto et al[41] 2011 Hypertension Humans 1 1 Koka et al[45] 2008 Nephrosclerosis Humans - - Wang et al[22] 2011 Subtotal nephrectomy Rats apical brush borders of the proximal tubules in human kidneys exhibit marked ACE and ACE2 colocalization. ACE is expressed at the proximal tubule brush borders and in glomerular endothelial cells. ACE has also been detected within renal vascular endothelial cells. higher ACE2 concentrations and lower ACE protein concentrations in the renal tubules had renoprotective effects in the early stages of the condition experienced by db/db mice without nephropathy. in rats, high salt diet led to a higher glomerular ACE/ACE2 ratio, resulting in kidney damage and oxidative stress. no associations were detected between the tubulointerstitial ACE/ACE2 ratio and histological or clinical parameters[22]. ACE is expressed along the entire renal tubular segment ACE is only expressed in the brush-border membrane of the late proximal tubules. ACE is expressed along the entire renal tubular segment ACE is only expressed in the brush-border membrane of the late proximal tubules. hemodialysis CKD patients showed lower plasma ACE2 activity than pre-dialysis CKD patients. female hemodialysis patients showed lower plasma ACE2 activity than male hemodialysis patients. the lower plasma ACE2 activity exhibited by dialysis patients may slow the catabolism of Ang II. Ye et al[14] also examined the glomeruli of db/db mice with established diabetic nephropathy. they observed upregulated ACE2 expression and downregulated ACE2 protein expression in the animal\u2019s renal tubules. in humans, we observed downregulated ACE2 expression and upregulated ACE expression in the glomeruli. lely et al[34] detected upregulated ACE2 expression in the glomeruli and tubules in biopsy samples from patients with type 2 diabetes-induced kidney disease. however, they only examined 8 diabetic patients and did not concentrate on the variation in ACE2 expression between biopsy samples from diabetic nephropathy and normal renal tissue. in diabetic kidneys, stronger ACE expression and weaker ACE2 expression were detected in the proximal tubules. similar staining patterns were seen in patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) and healthy controls (C) study examining kidney biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and patients with chronic allograft nephropathy Reich et al[16] demonstrated that upregulated ACE expression and downregulated ACE2 expression represent a generalized response to kidney damage[36], but further studies of ACE and ACE2 expression in the kidneys are necessary to confirm this. moon et al[31] noted stronger and weaker ACE and ACE2 staining in the tubules compared with the control rats. in a study of db/db mice, Chodavarapu et al[32] detected reduced glomerular ACE2, increased tubular ACE2 and ADAM17, and suspected ectodomain shedding of active renal ACE2 in the urine. 8 diabetic patients with overt proteinuria were compared with 66 non-diabetic patients with renal disease. ACE mRNA expression was significantly increased, but ACE2 mRNA expression was not significantly changed in the diabetic patients[35]. differences between the results obtained in human studies of type 2 diabetic nephropathy and those obtained using db/db models of diabetes without nephropathy might have been due to the different stages of diabetes. tubular ACE2 expression was detected in the glomeruli and tubules of 30 patients with IgA nephropathy. no variations in ACE2 expression were detected between the different renal diseases. we excluded patients that were taking ACE inhibitors or AT1-receptor blockers. Ang 1-7/ACE2 downregulate Ang 1-7 synthesis and promote renal Ang II expression and hypertension. all hypertensive rat strains exhibited significantly downregulated ACE2 mRNA and protein expression. ACE2 increases the synthesis of Ang 1-7 from Ang II, which helps to avoid excessive accumulation of Ang II. nephropathy and hypertensive cardiopathy showed significantly increased ACE expression and decreased ACE2 expression. hypertensive patients showed significantly reduced protein expression levels of ACE and ACE2 in the tubulointerstitium compared with the controls. there was little difference between the glomerular ACE and ACE2 protein expression levels of the two groups. soluble ACE2 activity correlates with hypertension and soluble ACE concentration decreases. soluble ACE2 concentration decreases, while soluble ACE2 concentration increases in systolic heart failure. urine is readily collected and available to identify biomarkers of kidney disease progression. recombinant ACE2 (hrACE2) slowed the progression of diabetic nephropathy and lowered NADPH oxidase activity and blood pressure. Xanthenone (XNT)[59] and diminazene (DIZE)[60] are ACE2 inhibitors. ACE2 activators have supra therapeutic effects on kidney disease than classical RAS inhibitors. ION ACE and ACE2 play significant roles in the RAS. their actions aim to achieve a balance between the ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis."}
