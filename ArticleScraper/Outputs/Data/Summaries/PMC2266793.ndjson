{"summary": "common cold questionnaire (CCQ) is used to discriminate those with and without a viral infection. it is used to assess the ability of the CCQ to detect viral infection and monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation. CCQ, asthma history and asthma control questionnaires were completed and repeated 4\u20136 weeks later. there is a need to quantify cold symptoms in the assessment of an asthma exacerbation. measures are especially needed to evaluate responses in treatment studies. the ability of these questionnaires to discriminate viral infection in acute asthma is not known, and their responsiveness in acute asthma is also unknown. sputum was collected after ultrasonic nebulisation of isotonic saline. subjects were diagnosed as positive or negative to respiratory viral infection. CCQ used in this study was adapted from that used as part of the common cold unit's standard protocol [3], [9]. a \u2018probable\u2019 viral infection is where moderate symptoms are noted in at least 2 of the above 4 categories. a \u2018possible\u2019 viral infection is where mild symptoms are noted in at least 2 of the above 4 categories or mild symptoms noted in 3 or more categories. all PCR assays proceeded using 12.5% of the cDNA product and the Eppendorf realMasterMix Probe ROX kit. subjects were considered virus positive if a virus was detected by direct molecular detection in sputum, swab (nasal or throat) or saliva. infected subjects were evaluated by calculating the effect size as described by Cohen et al. the effect size is the mean difference between the scores at the first and follow up visits divided by the standard deviation at the first visit. an effect size of 0.8 or more is considered a large response to change. the asthma history questionnaire detailed the age of diagnosis and the history of the subject's asthma over the past year. this included the number of exacerbations, doctor and hospital visits, episodes of worsened asthma and the number of days missed from work or school due to asthma. sputum samples were placed in an RNA lysis buffer. RNA was then reverse-transcribed to total cDNA. samples were assayed for presence of rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), influenza virus types A and B (IFA, IFB), respiratory syncytial virus types A and B (RSVA, RSVB), non-SARS coronavirus (CoV) and human metapneumovirus (MPV) virus RNA transcripts results were presented as median (interquartile range) or n (%) as appropriate. differences in subject characteristics and common cold score between virus positive and virus negative groups were determined (significance = p0.05) a lower percent predicted FEV1 were younger than the virus negative group and had a similar asthma control score. the questionnaire identified a similar proportion in both the viral and non-viral groups as having a \u2018probable virus\u2019 or \u2018no virus\u2019 (p = 0.802) CCQ and Viral Detection The ability of the CCQ to detect a respiratory virus infection in subjects with asthma, adults and children is displayed in Table 4. CCQ was scored and results categorised as a \u2018probable virus infection\u2019 compared to a \u2018no infection\u2019 or \u2018possible virus infection\u2019 result. ROC analysis was unable to determine an appropriate CCQ score to discriminate between a virus positive and virus negative result for all subjects or adults or children separately. sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding the chest symptom domain from the ROC analysis to account for the possible confounding effect that these symptoms may have in people with or. CCQs response to change following recovery from a respiratory virus infection was large. effect size calculated between the first and follow up visit at 4\u20136 weeks for 33 subjects who were virus positive was 1.01. this was in conjunction with significant clinical improvements in FEV1 percent predicted (mean (SD) 21.4(19.1)%, p0.0001) and asthma control score (1.6 (1.2), p0.0001). a significantly higher total score was evident in the virus positive group for adults but not children. there was no correlation between total CCQ score and percent-predicted FEV1. CCQ was scored and results categorised as a \u2018probable virus infection\u2019 compared to a \u2018no infection\u2019 or \u2018possible virus infection\u2019 result. a CCQ result of \u2018probable virus infection\u2019 did have a good positive predictive value for viral infection in children. sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding chest symptom domain from ROC analysis. CCQs response to change following recovery from a respiratory virus infection was large. effect size calculated between the first and follow up visit at 4\u20136 weeks for 33 subjects who were virus positive was 1.01. the CCQ performed poorly in discriminating between a viral and non-viral exacerbation in people with acute asthma. the poor discrimination of the CCQ in acute asthma was due to the low specificity of the CCQ in this setting. the low specificity for the CCQ in asthma may be due to several additional factors. non-infectious exacerbations of asthma could cause chest symptoms and reduce the specificity of the CCQ. the CCQ is an attractive instrument for monitoring response to viral infection in people with asthma due to viral infections. the combination of viral diagnosis and the CCQ should prove useful for the evaluation of antiviral and other therapies in asthma exacerbations."}
