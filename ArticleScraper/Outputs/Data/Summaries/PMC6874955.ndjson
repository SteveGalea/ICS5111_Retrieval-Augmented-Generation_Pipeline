{"summary": "the etiological agent of PED is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which targets the digestive tract of pigs. the disease is characterized by anorexia, vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and body weight loss and has a high mortality, especially in neonatal pigs. PEDV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus. the genome of 28.5 kb is polycistronic and consists of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3, spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein. PEDV replicates in intestinal epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages of piglets via the mouth and nasal cavity. mucins secreted by goblet cells are essential for maintaining enteric homeostasis and intestinal epithelial integrity. the integrity of the intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier is susceptible to early PEDV infection. as pathogenic organisms, are dominant in PEDV-infected animals. short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Coprococcus) and the butyrate-producing bacterium (Clostridium butyricum) are dramatically decreased due to dysbiosis in the context of PEDV infection. the host innate immune response, as first line of defence, can utilize PRRs to detect and respond to pathogen-associated molecular pattern MAV5 is an IFN- promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) with a pivotal role in the innate immune response against viral pathogens. activated IPS-1 can bind to the proline enrichment region of TRAF6/2, which activates NF-B through the IKK// complex and induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines. TLR3 mainly recognises the dsRNA virus genome during ssRNA replication. its horseshoe-shaped structure has a large surface area to promote the recognition of viral dsRNA by viral-infected cells. the inactivated RIG-I is self-folding, and its repressor domain covers other functional domains, inhibiting caspase-recruitment domains from playing the role of signal transduction. when cells are infected with viruses, the C-terminal of RIG-I binds to viral RNA, resulting in conformational changes. noma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) recognises dsRNA fragments larger than 1 kb. RIG-I recognises shorter dsRNA fragments. TLR signalling pathway is another pathway involved in innate immune response following PEDV invasion. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines play an important role in PEDV-induced inflammation and regulation of the immune response. autophagy is involved in the transfer of ssRNA to vesicles expressing TLR7. TLR9 recruits MyD88 to activate NF-B and IRF7. p50/p65 heterodimers are most abundant, by binding with inhibitory protein IB. NF-B translocates to the nucleus where it can mediate the transcription of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. in porcine, the NF-B pathway is mediated by inhibiting the activities of NF-B inhibitor. PEDV nucleocapsid protein and nonstructural protein (nsp) 1 impeded the p65 translocation and prevented NF-B from binding to the positive regulatory domain (PRD) II region of the IFN- promoter. also, the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain downregulated the NF-B signalling pathway by an inhibitory effect on TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. induction of the transcription of various inflammatory factors by another enteric alpha-coronavirus-transmissible gastroenteritis virus reflects the outcome of simultaneous activation of AP-1. PEDV can concurrently activate ERK1/2 and JNK/p38 for optimal replication. p53, a downstream protein of the JNK/p38 pathway could perpetuate IFN signalling to negatively affect PEDV replication in HEK239T cells. study suggested that IFN- had a greater inhibition of PEDV replication than IFN- and markedly upregulated the transcriptional expression of three antiviral proteins of utmost importance. PEDV failed to infect porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but could induce the transcription of IFN-I, including IFN- and IFN-. antiviral IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family (IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3) markedly inhibited by subverting RIG-1/MDA5 cascades in HEK293T cells and IPEC-J2 cells. ubiquitination and deubiquitination in the cytoplasm and nucleus are critically involved in modulation of the innate immune response. PEDV nsp1 can potently antagonise the nuclear translocation of IRF1 by reducing the production of peroxisomes. the proteasome-dependent degradation of the cAMP-regulated enhancer binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus could inhibit IFN-I yield in MARC-145 cells. NF-B signalling pathway NF-B plays an important role in PEDV-induced inflammation and regulation of the immune response. NF-B is confined to the cytoplasm as inactive homodimers and heterodimers, among which p50/p65 heterodimers are most abundant, by binding with inhibitory protein IB. NF-B translocates to the nucleus where it can mediate the transcription of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines the ER, trigger ER stress and activate NF-B, resulting in the upregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). the expression of IL-1, IL-1, TNF-, chemokine C-C ligands was increased by activating the NF-B promoter in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells transfected with the plasmid pCMV- ling pathway by an inhibitory effect on TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 dampening the expression of cytokines in the intestinal mucosa of piglets. the discrepancy between activation and inhibition of NF-B signalling pathway could be explained by different strains of PEDV. p53, a downstream protein of the JNK/p38 pathway could perpetuate IFN signalling to negatively affect PEDV replication in HEK239T cells. these findings argue for the notion that PEDV, in its favour, could adjust intracellular responses including the induction of MAPK signalling pathways. PEDV failed to infect porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells. but it could induce the transcription of IFN-I, including IFN- and IFN-. there are two main approaches to escape innate immunity. IFN- expression was negatively regulated by deubiquitinating RIG-I and STING in a catalytic-dependent manner in HEK293T cells and Vero cells [53]. PEDV blocked immunostimulant (polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid) mediated IRF-3 nucleus migration. cAMP-regulated enhancer binding protein disrupts enhanceosome assembly. protease of PEDV nsp5 could impair IFN-I yield in HEK293T cells. innate immune response and potential mechanisms of PEDV antagonising the IFN system. PEDV produces viral proteins to directly antagonise the IFN system. PEDV can utilize ERK1/2 and JNK/p38 to promote virus replication. a better understanding of the rapid-responding innate immune defence mechanisms would be beneficial to improve therapeutic strategies to antagonise PEDV infection. amino acids improve intestinal integrity and maintain normal physiological barrier function. amino acids preserve the local and overall immune system by modulating the expression of cytokines. inhibiting the activity of mTOR could induce IEC defects and intestinal villus atrophy in mice [61] mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) has the ability to promote the production of type I IFN by activating IRF-5 and IRF-7. IFN-I can activate phosphoinositide3-kinase- (PI3K-) Akt-mTOR signalling to regulate the expression of ISGs in certain cell types. vitamin D can block the nuclear translocation of NF-B p65, leading to the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-. vitamin D may suppress downstream NF-B signalling pathway through the RLR and TLR signalling pathways to alleviate intestinal damage caused by PEDV. mpIL-22 is a novel therapeutic intervention to curtail enteric diarrhea virus. mTOR signalling pathway plays an important role in the intestinal mucosal immune response, and thus intestinal health. leucine activated the mTOR signalling pathway, promoted the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and claudin-3, and regulated protein synthesis and metabolism. amino acids would be an influential additive to modulate the innate immunity against virus infection via mTOR signalling activation. a mixture of medical herbs (Taraxcum mongolicum, Viola yedoensis Makino, Rhizoma coptidis, and Radix isatidis) attenuated the growth performance impairment and intestinal lesions of newborn piglets challenged with PEDV. dietary supplementation of 200 and 500 IU vitamin D can mitigate the damage of porcine rotavirus in pigs. vitamin D may suppress the downstream NF-B signalling pathway through the RLR and TLR signalling pathways to alleviate the intestinal damage caused by PEDV. cationic carbon dots based on curcumin-capped and glutathione-capped Ag2S nanoclusters markedly enhanced the production of phosphorylated IRF3 and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) proteins. PEDV targets porcine enterocytes in the intestinal villi. it has developed various immune evasion strategies by blocking recognition of PRRs, suppressing activation of NF-B and IFN production, and disrupting ISGs induction."}
