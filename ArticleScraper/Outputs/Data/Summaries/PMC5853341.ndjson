Symbols represent each individual animal sampled at that time point; lines represent mean weight change for all individuals on that day. animals euthanized for early infection sampling are absent in the remainder of the sampling days. virus was detected at high levels in brains of mice that succumbed to disease at 13 days after infection. viral RNA was detected in all ocular samples from CCHFV-inoculated mice. hCD45+ reconstitution levels were similar at 4 days after infection in mock-inoculated control mice. CCHFV-OM and TR, CCHFV isolated from human patients in Oman and Turkey. data are presented as percentage of HLA-DR/CD38+ T cells expressing perforin. both phenotypic activation on T cells and cytotoxic functional activity were assessed in the mice. rates in both CCHFV-OM\u2013 and CCHFV-TR\u2013infected humanized mice were consistent with control mice. cellular infiltrates were mild to moderate in all but 1 animal (TR-1), in which infiltrates were abundant. however, in all evaluated CCHFV-TR mice and in OM-9, individual cell death was more frequent and both present within inflammatory foci and randomly distributed throughout the parenchyma. immunohistochemistry for CCHFV showed staining in the liver, spleen, lungs, and adrenal glands. in the liver, strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was noted in histiocytes and multinucleated giant macrophages within inflammatory foci. rare spindle cells consistent with endothelial cells had cytoplasmic staining in the adrenal gland of 2 animals. us Kidney Adrenal Eye Heart GI Tract DMEM-1 4 NS NS NS NS DMEM-3 33 NS \u2013 DMEM-4 33 NS TR-1 4 ++ ++ NS NS NS NS NS NS NS TR-3 4 ++ ++ NS NS NS NS NS NS TR-4b 20 +++ ++ + + + NS TR-6b 23 +++ ++ ++ + + + NS TR-8b 13 antigen was localized to brain, hepatic, splenic, and pulmonary tissues, with adrenal staining seen in CCHFV-TR mice. antigen was most abundant in CCHFV-TR\u2013inoculated mice euthanized because of disease. CCHFV-TR mice with terminal-stage disease infected with a crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strain are associated with neurological disease. a, B, Mice euthanized because of weight loss all showed neuropathological changes consisting of a pleocellular meningitis (A) or meningoencephalitis, and gliosis with formation of glial nodules. bunyavirus was found in brain parenchyma directly below the meninges. mild to extensive anti-CCHFV immunostaining was seen throughout the brains of CCHFV-TR humanized mice with terminal-stage disease. intense staining of neurons from the habenular nucleus is noted. immunostaining of the meninges and reactive astrocytes is seen in the hypothalamus. B, Astrocytes show colocalization of glial fibrillary acidic protein. three mice per group, and a control, were euthanized 4 days after infection. animals inoculated with CCHFV-OM (n = 6) exhibited minimal weight loss and recovered. animals inoculated with CCHFV-TR (n = 5) displayed slow progressive weight loss. viral RNA was detected in all blood and tissue samples analyzed from mice infected with either CCHFV-OM or CCHFV-TR. high levels of viral RNA were detected in the brains of CCHFV-TR\u2013infected animals that succumbed to disease. ocular samples were collected for PCR analyses in the remaining mice. hCD45+ reconstitution levels were similar at 4 days after infection in mock-inoculated control mice and infected mice regardless of challenge virus. in infected mice that were euthanized, either because of disease or at the scheduled end of the experiment, hCD45+ levels were significantly lower than in controls. this may represent apoptosis or direct infection of these cells by CCHFV. phenotypic activation on T cells and cytotoxic functional activity were assessed in the mice. up-regulation of HLA-DR and CD38, markers of human T-cell activation [18, 19], was observed in all humanized mice infected with CCHFV. it is unclear whether this represents a population of CD8+ T cells that could manage to nonspecifically kill infected cells in these animals. CCHFV-OM mice exhibited only rare, single-cell hepatocyte death associated with the inflammatory foci. other tissues examined, including heart, eye, kidney, adrenal gland, and ovary/uterus, revealed no significant findings. extraneural histological analysis of humanized mice. histochemistry for CCHFV showed staining in the liver, spleen, lungs, and adrenal glands. strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was noted in the liver, spleen, lungs, and adrenal glands. small numbers of mesenchymal cells in connective tissues were immunoreactive.

CCHFV has demonstrated neurotropism in severe disease [3], but to our knowledge there have been no detailed investigations of CNS infection. CCHF research has been limited to severely immunocompromised mouse strains that develop rapid, acute disease prohibiting dissemination to the CNS. a novel humanized mouse model of CCHF describes cellular targets and focal regions of infection in the brain.
