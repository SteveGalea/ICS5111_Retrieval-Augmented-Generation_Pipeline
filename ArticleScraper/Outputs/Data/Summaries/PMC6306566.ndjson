{"summary": "adults 60 years old seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness recruited from 2004\u20132005 through 2015\u20132016 during the winter seasons. the incidence of medically attended RSV was estimated for each seasonal cohort. each season, recruitment began when influenza activity was detected in the community. eligibility criteria varied by season but included fever/feverishness or cough during most seasons. maximum duration of illness was 10 days for 2004\u20132005 through 2006\u20132007 seasons. target-specific signals were determined by voltammetry, a process that generates electrical signals from ferrocene-labeled signal probes. samples collected from 2004\u20132005 through 2009\u20132010 seasons were previously tested using the GenMark multiplex assay in separate study of RSV illness in adults 50 years of age. natriuretic peptide (BNP) measures of cardiac and pulmonary function were abstracted, including peak flow, FEV1/FVC, oxygen saturation, and cardiac ejection fraction. additional abstractions were performed for participants who were hospitalized within 28 days after PCR-confirmed RSV illness. participants with RT-PCR-confirmed RSV were classified as having moderate to severe lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-msLRTD) if at least 3 of the following lower respiratory tract symptoms or signs were present. the same criteria were used to define RSV-msLRTD in a phase III clinical trial for RSV vaccine in older adults. test results from enrolled patients can be extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members with a respiratory illness visit during the enrollment period. the number of statewide cases occurring outside the enrollment period in the cohort was proportional to the number of statewide cases occurring outside the enrollment period. laboratory Archived samples were tested for the presence of respiratory virus nucleic acid using a multiplex respiratory virus panel. nucleic acid was extracted from the swabs using the Roche MagnaPure 2.0 system and amplified using target-specific primers. symptoms of acute respiratory illness and onset date were available from the original study enrollment interview. abstracted clinical data included additional symptoms not assessed during study enrollment, functional status, smoking status, physical exam findings, treatment, pulmonary function and presence of specific comorbid chronic diseases. a serious outcome was defined as acute care hospital admission, emergency department visit for acute illness, or pneumonia occurring within 28 days after enrollment. a moderate outcome was defined as new antibiotic or antiviral therapy, new/increased bronchodilator therapy, or new/increased systemic corticosteroid therapy during the 28-day window after enrollment. seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV illness was estimated in the community cohort for individuals 60 years of age for the period 2006\u20132007 through 2015\u20132016. all estimates were standardized to a 31-week period from approximately early October through early May using Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene surveillance data. the most common viral pathogens were coronavirus OC43, NL63, HKU1, 229E (n = 210; 14%), human metapneumovirus (n = 184; 12%), human rhinovirus (n = 135; 9%), and parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 (n = 74; 5%); 873 encounters were negative for all viral targets in the multiplex RT-PCR assay. y.8.8 60\u201364 55 (23) 495 (25) 27 (22) 28 (23) 65\u201374 101 (42) 836 (42) 53 (44) 48 (39) 75+ 87 (36) 683 (34) 41 (34) 46 (38) Gender.1.5 Male 85 (35) 805 (40) 40 (33) 45 (37) Female 158 (65) 1209 (60) 81 (67) 77 (63) Enrollment season.0001.0001 2004\u20132005 13 (5) 247 (12) 11 (9) common symptoms of RSV illness included sore throat, sputum production, cough, fever/feverishness, dyspnea, dyspnea, myalgia, and wheezing. most common diagnosis codes on the date of enrollment for RSV-positive patients were cough (45%), acute upper respiratory infection (21%), acute bronchitis (13%), acute sinusitis (12%). the presence of RSV-msLRTD on enrollment was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of serious clinical outcome. participants with msLRTD during the enrollment encounter had a higher prevalence of COPD and congestive heart failure (CHF) and a greater number of medical encounters in the 28 days after enrollment (median, 1 vs 2;
