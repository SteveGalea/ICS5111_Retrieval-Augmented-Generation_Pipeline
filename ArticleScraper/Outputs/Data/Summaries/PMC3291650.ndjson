{"summary": "initiation of antiviral immune response involves the action of specialized pattern recognition receptors (PRR) which detect conserved molecular structures of the invading pathogen. the presence of viral nucleic acids, such as viral RNA and DNA, can be sensed by specific intracellular PRRs. IAV infection leads to the exposure in the host cell of single-stranded genomic RNA and double stranded RNA. both receptors contribute to the proinflammatory response to IAV, but the initiation of the innate antiviral immune response largely depends on RIG-I mediated signaling. well characterized ubiquitin ligases mediate respectively NF-B and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation. deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been shown to negatively regulate RLR signaling by specifically removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several signaling molecules. polymorphisms in the A20 locus are associated with several autoimmune diseases. the role of A20 in the regulation of antiviral immune responses is less well described. the precise in vivo role of A20 in the response to viral infection remains to be clarified. A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF-B and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation [50]\u2013[52]. HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-B, IRF3 and IRF3. luciferase activity in cell extracts was analyzed in a luminometer. numbers are averages +/ SD of 3 samples per set-up. plasmids expressing RIG-I (2CARD), IRF7 and increasing amounts of A20. crossing these mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the lysozyme M promoter leads to specific deletion in myeloid cells. to stimulate the RIG-I receptor, we transfected A20myel-KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C) which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG-I rather than MDA5. immunoblotting with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser396, maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20 deficient BMDM compared to wild type cells. NF-B controls the expression of IL-6 and TNF, and NF-B and IRF3 control the expression of IFN. BMDM isolated from a20myel-WT and a20myel-KO animals were infected with IAV (moi 1). at different hours post infection cells were lysed and IL-6, IFN and A20 mRNA expression was analyzed by qPCR (A) cell culture supernatant was analyzed for TNF and IFN protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (B). A20myel-KO mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose of IAV. we inoculated both mice and control littermates with a sublethal dose of the mouse adapted IAV X-47 (H3N2) strain and monitored morbidity in terms of weight loss. total protein concentration in BAL fluid, which reflects lung damage and vascular leakage, was increased significantly at 7 and 10 days post infection in both wild type and A20my BAL was isolated from IAV infected mice at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. and KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN protein levels were analyzed by flow cytometry at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. the number of neutrophils recruited in the bronchoalveolar spaces upon IAV infection was clearly higher throughout infection in A20myel-KO mice compared to control animals. the number of resident alveolar macrophages (autofluorescent+ CD11c+ F4/80+ CD11b) was also elevated in A20myel-KO mice. hemagglutinin (HA) antibody titers were found in the serum of wild type and wild type littermates. however, no differences could be detected between wild type and wild type animals. these data suggest that mechanisms other than adaptive immunity contribute to the better viral clearance in A20myel-KO mice. it is generally believed that IAV-induced mortality is due to an excessive proinflammatory response in the lung. a20myel-KO mice were intranasally infected with a lethal dose of IAV and survival (p0.001) (A) and weight loss +/ SEM (B) was monitored for respectively 21 and 15 days p.i. a20 inhibits NF-B and IRF3 activation. previous studies have shown that ectopically expressed A20 negatively regulates NF-B and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation [50]\u2013[52]. Similarly, we show that A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF-B- and IRF3-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation induced by transfection of a truncated constitutive active form of RIG-I [53], corresponding to only the two N- HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-B, IRF3 (middle) or IRF7. plasmids expressing RIG-I (2CARD), IRF7 (middle) and increasing amounts of A20. luciferase activity in cell extracts was analyzed in a luminometer. crossing these mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the lysozyme M promoter leads to specific deletion in myeloid cells. we transfected A20myel-KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C) which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG-I rather than MDA5 [57] maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20myel-KO BMDM compared to wild type cells. NF-B controls the expression of IL-6 and TNF, and NF-B and IRF3 control the expression of IFN. similar results were obtained using peritoneal macrophages. BMDM isolated from a20myel-WT and a20myel-KO animals were infected with IAV (moi 1). at different hours post infection cells were lysed and IL-6, IFN and A20 mRNA expression was analyzed by qPCR (A) cell culture supernatant was analyzed for IL-6 and IFN protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (B). A20 deficiency in myeloid cells protects against IAV lung infection. we intranasally inoculated both A20myel-KO mice and control littermates with a sublethal dose of the mouse adapted IAV X-47 (H3N2) strain and monitored morbidity in terms of weight loss. total protein concentration in BAL fluid, which reflects lung damage and vascular leakage, was increased significantly at 7 and 10 days post infection. BAL was isolated from IAV infected mice at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. and KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN protein levels were analyzed by flow cytometry at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. the number of neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6C+) recruited in the bronchoalveolar spaces upon IAV infection was clearly higher throughout infection in A20myel-KO mice compared to control animals (figure 3D). the number of resident alveolar macrophages (autofluorescent+ CD11c+ F4/80+ CD11b) was also elevated in A20myel-KO mice. hemagglutinin (HA) antibody titers were found in the serum of wild type and wild type littermates. however, no differences could be detected between wild type and wild type animals. this indicates that humoral immunity is not affected by A20 expression in myeloid cells. these data suggest that mechanisms other than adaptive immunity contribute to the better viral clearance in A20myel-KO mice. a20myel-KO mice were intranasally infected with a lethal dose of IAV and survival (p0.001) (A) and weight loss +/ SEM (B) was monitored for respectively 21 and 15 days p.i. (D) total numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes in BAL were analyzed by flow cytometry. alveolar macrophages are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that attract innate immune cells to the lung during the primary phase of infection. they are also known to phagocytose virus infected apoptotic cells and antibody coated viral particles. in vivo infection with IAV resulted in higher levels of primarily neutrophil attracting chemokines such as KC and MIP-2. monocytes are protected against IAV infection and display reduced signs of immunopathology [74]\u2013[76]. During IAV infection these monocytes develop into inflammatory dendritic cells or proinflammatory macrophages [77] and are considered major contributors to IAV-induced immunopathology [78] ubiquitin-binding proteins TAX1BP1 and ABIN1 disrupt the TRAF3-TBK1-IKK complex, thereby negatively affecting K63-polyubiquitination of TBK1 and IKK. the identification of these substrates will be the topic of future investigations in our laboratory. RNA interference has rapidly evolved as a potent antiviral regimen. properly designed siRNAs have been shown to function as potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication. similar targeting of A20 might be of interest in the battle against other viral infections including RSV and SARS coronavirus. mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at the VIB Department of Molecular Biomedical Research in specific pathogen-free animal facilities. influenza infections were performed on age- (between 7 and 9 weeks old) and sex-matched littermates. sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE/Cholera filtrate; Sigma) to remove sialic acids from serum proteins capable of aspecific inhibition of agglutination. sera was inactivated by addition of 0.75% sodium citrate in PBS. cells and transfection HEK293T and MDCK cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. bone marrow cells were cultured 7 days in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) alveolar macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 1% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. western blotting For total lysates, cells were lysed at 4\u00b0C for 15 min in lysis buffer. immunoblots were revealed with anti-A20, anti-IB, anti-p65, and anti-histon H1 (Santa Cruz), anti-IRF3 (Invitrogen), anti-phospho-IRF3 and anti-phospho-IB (Cell Signaling) and anti-actin (MP Biomedicals) all intensities were calculated relative to the first lane ( = time 0).
