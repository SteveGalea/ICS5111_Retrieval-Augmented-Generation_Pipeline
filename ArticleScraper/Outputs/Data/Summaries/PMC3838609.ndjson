{"summary": "ethyl ether, methanol, glacial acetic acid, heptane, hexane, were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA) female adult, pigmented, homozygous, athymic, inbred nude rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) rats were randomized into 2 of 6 animals each (3 per cage) and placed in translucent laboratory rodent cages (10.5 in. 19 in. 8 in.) that were either clear (control) or red-tinted. rats had free access to food (no. 5053 Irradiated Laboratory Rodent Diet, Purina, Richmond, IN) and acidified water. s used in this study were purchased (polycarbonate translucent clear, catalog no. R20PC, Ancare, Bellmore, NY) or provided (polycarbonate translucent red-tinted, catalog no. 18780M, Lab Products, Seaford, DE) animal cages were maintained with identical stainless steel lids for holding food and water covered by polysulfone translucent clear microfilter tops (catalog no. N10MBT, Ancare) each day and at the same time, all cages on the rack shelves were rotated one position to the right (placed at an identical, premeasured distance apart) in the same horizontal plane; the cage at position 2 (last position at right on the shelf) was moved to position 1 (first position at left on the shelf) only new cages were used to clean and sanitize cages. all cages underwent 4 cleaning treatments during the course of the study. the cleaning treatment did not introduce noticeable pitting, glazing, or cracking, which would affect light transmittance. radiometric values of irradiance (W/cm2) were measured in the cages. the optical sensor on the meter was centered inside each cage and oriented in each of 4 horizontal directions of the room. the sensor was directed upward, directly toward the overhead fluorescent lamps lighting the room, with a distance of 1.4 m to the light source. spectral power distributions were recorded when the meter was pointing directly at the overhead fluorescent lamps lighting the room. d to eliminate the effects on feeding, stress, and potential mortality for a combined total of 72 whole-blood samples. each animal was lightly anesthetized by CO2 inhalation by placement for 10 to 15 s into a 10 in. 8 in. 8 in. acrylic gas anesthetizing chamber. the rat was removed from the chamber and placed in supine position while breathing room air unassisted. plasma samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C until assayed for melatonin, corticosterone, insulin, leptin, and acid\u2013gas measurements. arterial plasma melatonin levels were measured by using the melatonin rat 125I radioimmunoassay kit. all separations were done by using a 0.25-mm 30-m capillary column (model no. 2380, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) at 190 \u00b0C. all methyl esters were identified on the basis of their retention time compared with that of known standards. the rats in the red and clear cage groups were compared by using 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test. differences between group means were considered statistically different at a P value of 0.05. rat corona virus, sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, sialodacryoadenitis virus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan H1 virus, reovirus type 3, Mycoplasma pulmoni, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus 1 and 2, Hantaan virus, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, parvovirus more than 90% of the total fatty acids (TFA) was in the form of triglycerides. more than 5% was in the form of free fatty acids. rats were randomized into 2 of 6 animals each (3 per cage) Irradiance measures used a silicon-diode detector head (model no. SEL033) with a wide-angle input optic (model no. W6849) and a filter (model no. Y23104) to provide a photopic illuminance response across the visible spectrum. the meter and associated optics were calibrated annually and during the course of this study. all cages underwent 4 cleaning treatments during the course of the study. the cleaning treatment did not introduce noticeable pitting, glazing, or cracking, which would affect light transmittance. radiometric values of irradiance (W/cm2) were measured in the cages by using the same equipment and system. correlated color temperature in degrees Kelvin (CCT), a measure of the color appearance of light transmitted into the cages as it relates to temperature in degrees Kelvin. the measure of light photons landing on a given area (cm2),39 were measured (model CL200A, Chroma Meter, Konica\u2013Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) blood collections on all 6 rats in each group were designated at 4-h intervals to comprise the 24-h feeding period (that is, 0400, 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2400) each animal was tested only once every 5 d to eliminate the effects on feeding, stress, and potential mortality for a combined total of 72 whole-blood samples. animal red-lamp exposure at eye level during 45-s cardiocentesis procedure was no greater than 0.48 0.01 lx (1.16 0.04 W/cm2) investigators have nearly 4 decades of experience in using this technique developed in the laboratory. arterial plasma TFA, triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters were extracted from 0.1-mL samples. minimal detection level for the assay was 1 to 2 pg/mL. Detection sensitivity for corticosterone, insulin, and leptin plasma analyses were 4.5 ng/mL, 0.124 ng/mL, and 10 pg/mL. lower limits of the assays were 15 ng/mL, 0.15 ng/mL, and 10 pg/mL, respectively. coefficients of variation of all assays were less than 4.0%. cages were shifted left-to-right at the same level (red-tinted cages, upper shelf; clear cages, lower shelf) on the caging racks and showed little to no intercage variability. the data are typical of this type of fluorescent lamp, with signature peaks in appropriate wavelengths. the recorded irradiance, illuminance, and photon density values revealed key differences in light transmittance, depending on color of the cage. we chose 4 peak irradiance values correlating to the mercury and phosphor emissions that are typical of this type of fluorescent light source39 to compare peak amplitudes between cage types. nm wavelength bins Photon flux (photons/cm2/s) 400\u2013450 451\u2013500 501\u2013550 551\u2013600 601\u2013650 651\u2013700 Clear cage 7.28 1013 9.27 1013 3.16 1014 3.20 1014 2.84 1014 6.20 1013 Red cage 2.05 1013 1.08 1013 7.65 1013 2.65 1014 2.58 1014 5.84 1013 The Pearson correlation coefficient between cage types did not demonstrate a significant difference. levels for rats in clear cages were nearly 2-fold higher (P 0.05) than those of rats in red-tinted cages. the integrated mean levels of melatonin over the 24-h period were nearly 2-fold higher than those of animals in red-tinted cages. not significantly different between rats in red-tinted (29.0 mg/mL) and clear (30.3 mg/mL) cages. diurnal changes in blood plasma lipid concentrations in the arterial blood of adult female nude rats fed normal chow ad libitum. rats were exposed to dark-phase lighting cycles from 1800 to 0600. total calculated areas under glucose curves over the 24-h day were lower (P 0.05) in rats in red (13.87 1.21 mmol/L) compared with clear (14.28 1.25 mmol/L) cages. levels with asterisks are different (P 0.05) from levels without asterisks of the same group. daily rhythms in arterial pO2 were nearly identical between groups. peak values occurring in the late light phase (1600) and lowest values in the middark phase (2400). daily arterial pCO2 assessed over the 24-h day was significantly different from one another. a second but lower-amplitude peak (P 0.05) occurred in clear-caged rats near the end of the dark phase at 0400, decreasing to a nadir (P 0.05) at 0800. peak corticosterone levels for red-caged rats were phase-delayed 4 to 8 h compared with those of rats in clear cages, peaking (P0.05) at 2400 and decreasing to a nadir during the light phase at 1200. plasma concentrations of insulin increased to highest levels 2 h after onset of the light phase (0800) in rats in clear cages, insulin levels rapidly declined over a 4-h interval from their peak at 0800 to their lowest levels at 1200. red-caged rats experienced a gradual decline over 12 h from peak insulin concentration at 2400 to the lowest levels (1200) daytime animal room illumination (mean 1 SD) at the center of the room and at 1 m above the floor (radiance detector facing upward toward light ballasts) had relatively small variance (n = 82 measurements) and was 420.54 3.51 lx (172.42 1.44 W/cm2) measurements of photometric illuminance (lx) and radiometric irradiance (W/cm2) from outside and inside the front of each cage were made daily at position 1 through 4 all animal cages were of equal dimensions (19 in. 10.5 in. 8 in.; wall thickness, 0.1 in.) and were autoclavable to 121 \u00b0C. the measured CCT of the fluorescent lamps in the room was 3250 K; the red-tinted cage CCT was markedly lower than that for the room. cages Clear cage Irradiance (W/cm2) 84 63 Photon flux (photons/cm2/s) 1.20 x 1015 0.72 x 1015 Illuminance (lx) 238 lx 162 lx CCT (K) 3250 2300 Table 2.
