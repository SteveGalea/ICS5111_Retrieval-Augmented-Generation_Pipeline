{"summary": "lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome and related coronaviruses, filoviruses, henipaviruses, and other paramyxoviruses are isolated from bats. lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and related coronaviruses (SARS-related CoV), filoviruses, henipaviruses, and other paramyxoviruses are among the the most recent outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo in 2014 infecting 27,898 people and causing 11,296 reported deaths. the outbreak has been traced back to a single incident of a young child playing in the vicinity of a hollow tree frequented by bats [18], now identified as a potential source of spillover of the EBV. the ability of bats to spread zoonotic diseases and the fact they live close to humans heighten the potential threat of disease spillover the genesis of cohabitation of bats and humans in Ve Golokuati has not been documented, nor has there been any disease surveillance in the area. the residents' perceptions of disease transmission risks from bats to humans are not well understood particularly on a landscape scale. study was carried out in the wet semiequatorial climatic zone of Ghana. anthropogenic drivers have degraded forest cover considerably. the town is located in the forest-savannah ecotone dominated by Guinea Savannah Woodlands. houses and compounds are separated by winding footpaths. residents share facilities such as public places of convenience, water sources, and the open spaces such as recreational fields. quantitative and qualitative data were derived from questionnaire administration among 150 residents of the study community. respondents targeted for interview included those in households located close to bats' roosts and individuals who through their daily activities such as farming, trading, recreation, and relaxation get exposed to bats either directly or indirectly. a six-member team including one principal investigator undertook a transect walk. the walk was to identify the roosting and feeding sites of bats. a total of 18 E. gambianus roosts and 19 feeding sites were observed along the transect line. a follow-up visit to the study area in April 2015, after the outbreak of the Ebola virus in parts of west africa. the findings showed that about 48% of the residents were migrants from over 40 different towns and villages in the Volta Region of Ghana. about 12%, mainly those above 65 years and those below 20 claimed that they were unemployed. the township was a protected niche for peaceful coexistence of bats and humans. the fact that the bats were hardly disturbed by residents made the township a protected niche for peaceful coexistence. residents carried out their daily chores outdoors under trees colonized by E. gambianus. household chores included food preparation, dish washing and manual laundry. households installed rain harvesting facilities to collect water for domestic uses. the use of bats as food brought people more directly into contact with bats than any other activity. the sequence of events involved in preparing bat meat as food included hunting, handling, butchering, dressing, smoking, and cooking. the people of Ve Golokuati, however, would hardly eat E. gambianus but rather E. helvum which were abundant in the area in the past but has become rare locally. this would explain why most of the younger people did not eat bat bushmeat, since the E. gambianus which were abundant in the area are not appealing to most people because of their smaller size. domestic stock (e.g., sheep, goats, and poultry) interacted directly and indirectly with the bats. most of these animals were sheltered in pens and coops within the households. but were allowed to roam in search of food during certain times of the day when they fed on foliage and fruits dropped by bats. the most common morbidity cases handled by the health centre were malaria, anaemia, intestinal worms, acute respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea, and skin diseases. the most common cases handled by the health centre were malaria, anaemia, intestinal worms, acute respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and skin diseases. disease cases % Malaria 20761

and injuries 799 1.6 Pneumonia 744 1.5 Typhoid fever 420 0.9 We assessed the experience of fevers among respondents in relation to the closeness of their economic about 48% of the residents were migrants from over 40 different towns and villages in the Volta Region of Ghana. 8% had tertiary education, 31% secondary education, 42% junior secondary/middle school education, and 19% little or no education. about 12%, mostly those above 65 years and those below 20 claimed that they were unemployed. the population of bats present in Ve Golokuati normally increased during the dry season (November to January), which coincided with the fruiting of plants. there has been net decrease in total bat population in the town over the past decade from the perspective of respondents. the use of bats as food brought people more directly into contact with bats than any other activity. a logistic regression analysis showed that there was 98% chance of more men eating bat bushmeat than women. participants at the FGD indicated that no bat meat was offered for sale at the local market. the people of Ve Golokuati would hardly eat E. gambianus but rather E. helvum which were abundant in the area in the past but has become rare locally. a study of the relationship between eating of bat bushmeat and age was statistically insignificant. none of the younger people (ages 15\u201325) interviewed ate bat bushmeat. residents of Ve Golokuati were convinced bats do not harbor any diseases. they were convinced there has not been any strange disease outbreaks in the town since the arrival of the bats. malaria accounted for about 42% followed by acute respiratory infection (18%) and anaemia (9.7%). malaria accounted for about 42% followed by acute respiratory infection (18%) and anaemia (9.7%). farmers in the community who encountered activities of bats were more likely to contracting fevers than those who do not encounter bats. these threats were rooted in misinformation and incitement of people against the existence of bats. animal-bat interaction occurs because humans are encroaching on bats' habitats, just as bats are utilizing human structures as roosts. the interactions may be indirect, in the form of odour from faecal droppings, urine, aerosolization of saliva, and glandular body secretions. there are no suspected cases of spillover of disease from bats to humans in the township of Ve Golokuati. most suspected cases of fevers are treated as \u201cmalaria\u201d and there is a possibility of misdiagnosis. the official figures and respondents' perceptions may overdiagnose malaria, while underestimating the endemic zoonotic disease burden. the bats within the township were protected from threats and other disturbances better than in the wild. human interaction occurs because humans are encroaching on bats' habitats. the interactions may be indirect, in the form of odour from faecal droppings, urine, aerosolization of saliva and glandular body secretions. the presence of bats in the Ve Golokuati Township poses a serious conservation dilemma. there have been no suspected cases of disease spillover from bats to human. relocating bats to surrounding forested areas with the help of experts from the Ghana Wildlife Division may offer a long term solution. the initiative would help to promote ecotourism and meet the aspirations of the people. in the short term, the contamination of harvested rainwater by bat urine and faeces can be minimized by delaying rainwater harvesting."}
