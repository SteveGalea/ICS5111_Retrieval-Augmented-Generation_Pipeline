{"summary": "cultures secreting neutralizing antibodies were identified by a microneutralization assay using the prototype H5N1 clade 1 virus. the antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution. the cross-reactivity of FLD194 was determined in neutralization assays using a panel of 13 human and avian pseudotype viruses. 0.019 A/indonesia/05/05 2.1.3 0.149 0.280 0.033 A/whooper Swan/Mongolia/244/05 2.2 0.345 0.293 0.008 A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1A/05 2.2 0.010 0.015 0.036 A/Egypt/3300-NAMRU3/08 2.2.1 >20 >20 0.020 A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 2.2.1 0.3 antibody FLD194 protects mice against lethal challenge from clade 1 virus. mice received 2.5 or 25 mg/kg FLD194 or an irrelevant antibody as control. survival (A and B) and body weight (C and D) were recorded daily. the crystalline HA-Fab complex consists of a 1:1 complex of the Fab with monomeric HA. it is likely that the inclusion of isopropanol in the solvent on this occasion led to dissociation of the HA trimer and promoted crystallization. HA2 shows that there is a slight reorientation of RBD in the HA-Fab complex structure. the structure of the HA-Fab complex is almost unchanged in the crystalline monomer. it is possible to dock three FLD194 Fabs onto an HA trimer. heavy chain CDR1 (HCDR1) contacts the 140-loop, site A (Ca2), and HCDR2 contacts residues near residue 81, site E (Cb) two light chain CDRs (LCDRs) make contacts near residue 128, at site B (Sa), and LCDR1 also contacts residue 122 in site E (Cb) this part of the site has a surface area of 439 2, comprising 56% of the total buried surface area of HA. binding to Gln-122 contributes the largest buried surface area of 89 2 of the three contacted residues. the Cys-98 side of HCDR3 penetrates the cleft between the 140-loop and the 120\u2013128 strand of HA. this penetration allows Ser-99 of HCDR3 to form hydrogen bonds with residues located in the cleft. on the Asn-169 side, asn-28 and Tyr-30 of LCDR1 form hydrogen bonds with Gln-122. the antibody 100F4 (9) was also mapped to Glu-225, a residue that is contacted by the HCDR3 of FLD194. the crystal structure of the complex formed by the FLD194 Fab with H5 HA shows that the receptor-binding site is not contacted by the antibody. however, the antibody is highly effective in neutralizing H5 viruses (IC90100 ng/mL) by comparison with HA2-reactive antibodies. inhibition data suggest complete receptor-binding inhibition requires stoichiometric binding to each HA subunit. neutralization at lower antibody occupancy could occur at the membrane fusion stage of virus entry. the micrograph of H5 HA-rosette-IgG complexes indicates that FLD194 binds between two neighboring HAs and cross-links them. the orientation of the Fab fragment of IgG bound to HA is similar to that observed for Fab in the crystal structure of the HA-Fab complex. the thickness of the Fab layer can be attributed primarily to the projecting Fc regions of the bound antibodies. HA2 contains two prominent -helices, helix-A and helix-B. the longer helix-B forming a coiled-coil through interactions with helix-B. helix-A is linked to the N terminus of helix-B by an extended interhelical loop, HA2 residues 58\u201375. dissociation may occur on dissociation and, once formed, it may prevent trimer reformation. retention of the coiled-coil structure formed at the N terminus of helix-B has been taken to suggest complete dissociation of the trimer and trimer reformation are not components of the structural transition required for membrane fusion. EM analyses of IgG-HA and IgG-virus complexes suggest FLD194 neutralizes viruses by blocking receptor binding, shielding HAs from cellular receptors by the Fc parts of the antibody. the location of the epitope and the suggested role of antibodies bound to it are consistent with conclusions that antigenic variation can result from amino acid substitutions. the atomic structure coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as PDB ID code 5A3I. the atomic structure coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as PDB ID code 5A3I."}
