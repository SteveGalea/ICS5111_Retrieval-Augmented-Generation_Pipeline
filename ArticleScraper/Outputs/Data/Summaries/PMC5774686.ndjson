{"summary": "information collected on admissions included patient age, sex, admission year and month, and medications dispensed. oseltamivir usage increased substantially in 2009 and is now commonly used, with almost 40,000 hospitalizations treated with oseltamivir in the years 2012 through 2015. a third neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir was approved in 2014. rimantadine, amantadine, oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and zanamivir are not registered in Hong Kong. the drug has proven efficacy in reducing the duration of uncomplicated influenza illness in randomized controlled trials. oseltamivir dispensations to 86,477 unique patients in 98,253 admission episodes. we identified amantadine dispensations to 1,823 unique patients in 4,152 admission episodes. 98,253 hospitalization episodes in which oseltamivir was dispensed. 66% of the episodes were in people 65 years of age, and 54% were males. oseltamivir usage in admission episodes had the highest rates in persons 85y. in all age groups the rates of oseltamivir were higher in the post-pandemic period than before 2009. the highest rates of usage in persons 45-64y, 65-84y, and 85y occurred in February 2015 at the peak of a large H3N2 epidemic with the H3N2 component of the 2014/15 vaccine component. 1.3% of persons 85y in Hong Kong were admitted to hospital and dispensed oseltamivir. in the winter of 2009, an oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) virus circulated and amantadine use clearly increased in older adults. another spike in usage can be seen later in the 2009\u201310 pandemic when the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus caused a major local epidemic. oseltamivir use increased significantly after the 2009\u201310 pandemic. in since 2009 almost 30,000 hospitalizations received an oseltamivir dispensation. oseltamivir usage approximates the estimated occurrence of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in older adults. oseltamivir was dispensed to 0.26% of the population as inpatients during the 2009\u201310 pandemic. 80% of the population was in outpatient clinics, 18% in emergency rooms, and 2% in hospitalizations. oseltamivir is being used in Hong Kong but at very low levels compared to oseltamivir. oseltamivir usage increased considerably following the 2009\u201310 pandemic. it is unclear why oseltamivir use did not increase from 2006 onwards. it is possible that increased attention to pneumonia and increased laboratory testing led to greater identification of influenza virus infections. use of antivirals in public hospitals is unlikely to be under-ascertained in public hospitals. but it is unlikely that we have under-ascertained antiviral use in public hospitals. this study demonstrates the value of using electronic hospital records to analyze medication use."}
