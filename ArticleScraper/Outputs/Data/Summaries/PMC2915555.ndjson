{"summary": "a multicenter, longitudinal, and self-control study was used. eighty-two breast cancer patients were given combined yunzhi and danshen capsules for six months on a daily basis. results showed a significant improvement in physical function, role-physical, role-emotion and health transition. using danshen as a supplement may further promote the immunomodulatory activities of yunzhi. previous studies on the immunity of combined yunzhi and danshen (YZDS) in breast cancer patients have shown that a 6-month treatment with YZDS capsules could be beneficial for immunomodulatory functions. patients were excluded if they had cancer in both breasts or cancer metastases were present, had abnormal liver and renal function, were either pregnant or breastfeeding, had a significant history of drug hypersensitivity, or were taking other alternative medicine or supplements. 7%\u201310% difference in quality of life between women with and without breast cancer. all subjects were asked whether they had experienced any discomfort or adverse events, by means of an open-ended question at each study visit. particular instances of discomfort or adverse events were then sorted into 3 categories: \u2018Hot Constitution\u2019 for complaints such as cold sore or sore throat; \u2018Cold Constitution\u2019 for dizziness or diarrhea; and \u2018Others\u2019 for vomiting or stomach discomfort. the questionnaire was reviewed by an expert panel including 2 Chinese medicine practitioners, 2 physicians, 2 nurses, and 1 epidemiologist. intention to treat using the mean within the group was applied to replace the missing data. outcome measures on quality of life and vitality status between pre- and post-treatment over 6 months were compared. a baseline assessment (V1) of vitality status and quality of life was obtained. patients then received 6-month YZDS treatment on a daily basis. checks were made at the 8th week (V2) and 16th week (V3). events were recorded in the serious adverse events form and reported within 24 hours to the Ethics Committee. the questionnaire was reviewed by an expert panel including 2 Chinese medicine practitioners, 2 physicians, 2 nurses, and 1 epidemiologist. four patients withdrew from the study, two because they did not believe YZDS would have any beneficial effect. one was afraid of the blood test for the safety profile, and one was afraid of contracting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) the mean age of the participants was 45.6 years (SD = 6.8). most of the patients had been diagnosed with stage II breast cancer (62.2%) the agreement between the diary reports and the capsule checks was 99.9%. intervention effects on quality of life were all significantly improved (P 0.05) after 6-month YZDS treatment. social function 47.41 11.24 49.54 7.47 0.104 Role-emotion 57.72 39.56 70.33 34.34 0.008* Mental health 59.41 10.02 59.80 8.95 0.772 Health transition 2.84 1.25 2.05 0.94 0.001* The vitality status findings were consistent with the quality of life using the SF-36 Health Survey questionnaire. four patients withdrew from the study, two because they did not believe YZDS would have any beneficial effect. one was afraid of the blood test for the safety profile, and one was afraid of contracting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) the mean age of the participants was 45.6 years (SD = 6.8). most of the patients had been diagnosed with stage II breast cancer (62.2%) the agreement between the diary reports and the capsule checks was 99.9%. intervention effects on quality of life and vitality status were all significantly improved after 6-month YZDS treatment. participants experienced less fatigue (P 0.001), better quality of sleep (P 0.001), better appetite (P 0.001), more regular bowel movements (P 0.001) and more stable emotion (P 0.001) repeated analysis in respect of period since breast cancer diagnosis also found no significant difference in the change of vitality status. the findings support the therapeutic effect of a combined treatment of YZDS on quality of life and vitality status. rising stress levels make it very difficult for cancer patients to care for themselves, thereby causing many psychological and physical problems. but the evidence suggests that a significant reduction in and management of disease- and treatment-related symptoms could improve the quality of life among women with breast cancer. a control group leaves open the possibility that its positive findings are attributable to the placebo effect of herbal therapy. the current study,11 its broad sample source, its low dropout rate and its good compliance rate may not limit the generalizability of the findings. study is first step to explore efficacy of herbal therapy on quality of life in breast cancer patients. results from outcome studies could provide evidence for efficacy."}
