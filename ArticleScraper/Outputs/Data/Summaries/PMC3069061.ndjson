{"summary": "reorganization of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) whorl structures coincident with the onset of blood meal digestion. we used proteomics and RNAi to functionally identify midgut epithelial cell proteins that contribute to RER whorl formation. the size and number of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells decreased significantly after feeding. hr PBM was completely blocked. conclusions alpha-COPI was found to be required for the formation of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells of unfed Aa. aegypti mosquitoes. whorl-like smooth ER structures have also been shown to form in mammalian tissue culture cells that over express transfected ER resident proteins or fluorescent protein gene fusions containing heterologous transmembrane domains. weak protein-protein interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of highly abundant ER imbedded proteins are sufficient to induce whorl formation. a deficiency in alpha-COPI blocked the expression of three late phase midgut proteases in blood fed mosquitoes. the early phase of blood meal digestion, which is characterized by the synthesis and secretion of the early trypsin protease, was not dependent on alpha-COPI expression. most of the RER contained in the midgut epithelial cells of amino acid fed mosquitoes was arranged in short linear stacks. a recovery period of 120 minutes after amino acid feeding gave similar results. Statistical analysis using Pearson Chi-square test revealed that the total whorl area in amino acid fed mosquitoes at both 30 min and 120 min post-feeding was significantly less than the total whorl area in unfed mosquitoes. to test this possibility, we prepared total protein extracts from midguts of unfed and amino acid fed (30 min and 120 min post-feeding) mosquitoes. antibody shows differential expression of four ER resident midgut proteins in response to amino acid feeding in ae. aegypti mosquitoes. proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotting. three-day-old female mosquitoes were unfed or amino acid fed and dissected after 30 min. protein samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. proteins were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion prior to LC-MS. EM analysis revealed that the majority of RER whorl unwinding had already occurred by 30 min post amino acid feeding. this result suggests that SND1 is most likely not associated with whorl maintenance since its presence in microsomal fractions is independent of whorl formation. peptides corresponding to alpha-COPI, beta-COPI, beta'-COPI subunits were identified in the microsomal fractions isolated from unfed and fed mosquitoes. more peptides corresponding to the alpha-COPI, beta-COPI, beta'-COPI subunits were identified in the microsomal fractions isolated from unfed mosquitoes. 100% of the alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes showed a similar decrease in alpha-COPI transcript levels. we used this dsRNA injection protocol to knock down alpha-COPI expression in mosquitoes that were either uninjected, or injected with dsRNA targeted against the control Fluc gene. c dsRNA injected mosquitoes showed highly disorganized endosomal structures and extended regions of swollen RER. a similar quantitative analysis of midgut epithelial cells from amino acid fed alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes showed highly disorganized endosomal structures and extended regions of swollen RER. whorls with a minimum of five stacked ER membranes were counted. the total area of each whorl was determined as described in figure 2 legend. dsRNA injected unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes was significantly less than in fluc dsRNA injected unfed mosquitoes. we injected mosquitoes with fluc and alpha-COPI dsRNA 3 days prior to blood feeding. we used Western blotting to detect protease protein expression at 3 hr PBM and 24 hr PBM. lack of late phase serine protease expression in alpha-COPI deficient mosquitoes was associated with ejection of the undigested blood meal between 12\u201330 hr PBM. aegypti mosquitoes were fed an artificial amino acid meal and dissected midguts were characterized for ultrastructural changes at the subcellular level using electron microscopy (EM) large whorls of stacked RER membranes were observed in midgut epithelial cells from unfed (sugar only) mosquitoes. three-day-old Ae. aegypti females were kept unfed (sugar fed), or fed an amino acid meal for 30 min. and then sacrificed and dissected 30 min. or 120 min. later. dissected midguts were fixed for electron microscopy preparation. ation of the ER in midgut epithelial cells of amino acid fed mosquitoes may be associated with differential abundance of KDEL-containing ER resident proteins. to test this possibility, we prepared total protein extracts from midguts of unfed and amino acid fed (30 min and 120 min post-feeding) mosquitoes. Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes the ubiquitously expressed glyceraldehyde-3P dehydrogenase protein (GAPDH) was performed to control for equal protein loading. we isolated microsomal proteins from midgut tissues of unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes (30 min post-feeding) each of the eight protein samples was analyzed by LC- MS/MS. 127 proteins were identified using the Ae. aegypti genome database in a sequest-based search. cellular component Biological process Accession number alpha-COPI 139 kDa 7 0 COPI vesicle coat Vesicle-mediated transport XP_001663309 beta'-COPI 107 kDa 8 4 COPI vesicle coat ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport XP_001657383. alpha-COPI, beta'-COPI, beta'-COPI, subunits were identified in the microsomal fractions isolated from unfed mosquitoes than fed mosquitoes. the observed differential abundance of COPI subunits in the two midgut microsomal fractions suggests that they could be associated with RER whorls. we tested this idea by knocking down alpha-COPI expression using RNAi. EM analysis of representative midguts from alpha-COPI and Fluc dsRNA injected mosquitoes showed that large characteristic RER whorls were present in the midguts of unfed fluc dsRNA injected mosquitoes. a similar quantitative analysis of midgut epithelial cells from amino acid fed alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes showed highly disorganized endosomal structures. figure 6. Knock down of alpha-COPI expression is associated with disorganization of endosomal structures and appearance of extended regions of swollen RER in unfed mosquitoes. dsRNA injected mosquito dissected 120 min. after amino acid feeding (8,800 magnification). the total whorl area in fluc dsRNA injected unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes was significantly less than in Fluc dsRNA injected unfed mosquitoes using the Pearson Chi-square test. expression of late phase midgut proteases is inhibited in alpha-COPI deficient mosquitoes Blood meal digestion in Ae. aegpti mosquitoes requires the synthesis and secretion of numerous proteases. the pattern of AeET protein expression is similar in fluc and alpha-COPI dsRNA injected mosquitoes, suggesting that alpha-COPI functions are not required for early phase blood meal digestion. however, as shown in Figure 9B, 100\u2013400 ng of alpha-COPI dsRNA blocks expression of all three abundant late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM in a dose-dependent manner. lack of late phase serine protease expression in alpha amino acids meals are sufficient to induce early events in the blood digestion process. we used EM ultrastructural analysis to test if amino acid feeding induces ER whorl unwinding. the most abundant whorls consist of rough ER membranes based on high density of ribosomal particles. treatment of mouse Leydig cells with the piperazine derivative diethylcarbamazine citrate led to the appearance of large lipid droplets, degenerative mitochondria, and giant smooth ER whorls in some cells. a similar loss of function study leading to the formation of ER whorls was seen in human HeLa cells in which expression of the ER protein Yip1A was knocked down by RNAi. the LC-MS/MS analysis identified 127 proteins using microsomal midgut protein samples from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes. eight proteins were considered candidate whorl associated proteins based on their known location and function in ER and Golgi membrane compartments. loss of alpha-COPI expression is associated with the absence of RER whorls in unfed mosquitoes, as well as membrane disorganization and ER swelling in midgut epithelial cells of unfed female dsRNA injected mosquitoes lacked both RER whorls and AaET protein expression. synthesis and secretion of AeET was not altered in blood fed alpha-COPI deficient mosquitoes. expression of three abundant late phase proteases (AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT) was inhibited. s disrupts RER whorl formation without decreasing the total amount of RER membrane in cells. we propose that COPI coatomer proteins directly contribute to whorl formation through subunit assembly. the feeding buffer was composed of 100 mM NaHCO3 and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2.
