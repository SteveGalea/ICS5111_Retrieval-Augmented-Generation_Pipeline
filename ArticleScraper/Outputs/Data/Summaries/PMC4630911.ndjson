{"summary": "the mechanism conferring this antiviral response is not fully understood. we investigated the differential protein expression of Pteropus alecto kidney cells following transfection with the viral mimic, Poly I:C. poly I:C induced a rapid metabolic shift towards glycolysis within the PaKiT03 cells at 4 hpt. on the other hand ribosomal subunit proteins were seen as down-regulated by iTRAQ. this study provides new insight into the antiviral response of bat cells."}
