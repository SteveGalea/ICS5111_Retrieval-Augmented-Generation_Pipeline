{"summary": "in 1905, his research findings suggested that macrophages from infected animals had elevated ability of killing bacteria. in 1973, North and his colleagues found that independent cellular factors could also promote resistance of infection without involvement of pathogens. in 1989, abramson and his colleagues reviewed the different functions and lymphokines secretion between two types of cloned helper T cells. a new functional state called M2-like phenotype 9 was proposed. a new functional state called M2-like phenotype 9 was proposed. a new functional state called M2-like phenotype 9 was proposed. macrophages can be converted into each other in their specific microenvironment. many key transcription factors are involved in macrophage polarization12. signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs)13, interferon-regulatory factor (IRFs)14, 15, nuclear factor (NF)-B 16, activator protein (AP) 1 17, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)- 18,19 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CR macrophages are polarized toward an M1 phenotype in the early stages of bacterial infection. macrophages are activated and produce a large amount of pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-, IL-1, and nitric oxide. this mechanism has been considered to be involved in infection with Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes 21, and the early phases of infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis p50 subunit of NF-B served as key regulator of M2-driven LPS-tolerant state in this transformation 26. as excessive injury is reduced, however, M2 phenotype macrophages also induce an immunosuppressive state, resulting in a more susceptible situation to re-infection. alveolar macrophage acts as viral reservoir which protects HIV-1 from hostile elements and induces HIV-1 associated neurological damage 33, 34. parasites both M1 and M2 phenotype macrophages are involved in parasite infestation, depending on subtype and duration of parasite infestation models. 2 cytokines and anti-inflammatory signals in vivo for a long time could still develop a classically activated phenotype in response to LPS or IFN-. Arg1 is a key mediator for the development of helminth infestation through restraining both unrestricted Th2-mediated fibrotic pathology and intestinal damage associated with increased Th1/Th17 cytokines. macrophages are activated and produce a large amount of pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-, IL-1, and nitric oxide (NO), which kill the invading organisms. macrophages undergo apoptosis or polarize to an M2 phenotype. the p50 subunit of NF-B served as the key regulator of M2-driven LPS-tolerant state in this transformation 26. as the infection persists, host may present a LPS-tolerant state. as the excessive injury is reduced, however, M2 phenotype macrophages also induce an immunosuppressive state, resulting in a more susceptible situation to re-infection. resident macrophage acts as viral reservoir which protects HIV-1 from hostile elements and induces HIV-1 associated neurological damage 33, 34. parasites both M1 and M2 phenotype macrophages are involved in parasite infestation, depending on subtype and duration of parasite infestation models. macrophages which are exposed to Th2 cytokines and anti-inflammatory signals in vivo could still develop a classically activated phenotype in response to LPS or IFN-, and become antimicrobial through producing NO 36. a study using my. Arg1 blockade or deficiency in hematopoietic and endothelial cell lines had little effect on response to acute orchronic infection by Trichuris muris40. apolipoprotein B-lipoproteins accumulate in inner lining of large and medium sized arteries 41. monocytes and macrophages play essential roles in the development of atherosclerosis 43. in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction, the pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by M1 phenotype macrophages were elevated, such as IL-6, with high levels predicating a poor outcome 46. an in vitro study indicated that M1 phenotype macrophages could also induce smooth muscle cell proliferation and release of vasoactive molecules. obesity is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease 56. adipose tissue is composed of adipocytes, preadipocytes, endothelial cells and immune cells. the activated ATM secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to insulin resistance 58. adipose tissue in lean animals also contains a moderate number of macrophages with a state of alternatively activated ATM. adipose tissue also contains a moderate number of macrophages with a state of alternatively activated. tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), the major component of those inflammatory cells infiltrated in cancer, play critical roles in the formation of cancer. in the stage of tumor initiation, TAM releases a large amount of inflammatory mediators to create an inflammatory environment and promote tumor growth. TNF-, TAM shows a defective NF-B activation together with low levels of IL-12, IL-1, TNF- as well as IL-6. markers of M2 such as Arg1, Ym1, FIZZ1, and MRC1 are all expressed on TAM. a wide accepted view is that different infiltrating leukocytes, mediators, and signals in tumor microenvironments interact with TAM. ix metalloproteinases 2 and matrix metalloproteinases 9 secreted by TAM could impair the matrix, and help tumor cells escape from the basement membrane. the distinct phenotypes of macrophages regulate the activity of tumor cells in the different stages of tumors. a recent study indicated that histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) could induce macrophage polarization and vessel normalization through the down-regulation of placental growth factor (PlGF), and inhibition of tumor growth as well as metastasis 82. targeting NF-B also means a novel direction for the treatment in the future. macrophages are shown to be an M1 phenotype, which produces a great amount of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-1, NO, exacerbates the lung injury and accelerate the airway remodeling 85. septic Complications Macrophage polarization is involved in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis. macrophage activation was first defined in 1992, almost 80 years after Metchnikoff's initial description of macrophage activation 1, 7. alternatively activated macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory mediators, promote tissue repair, and regulate immune response in the initiation, development, and cessation of many inflammatory diseases. cellular markers that distinguish the phenotype of macrophages during inflammatory diseases need further studies to confirm. anti-CSF-1 antibodies were shown to promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function to suppress tumor growth 93, 94. PPAR inhibitors could decrease M2 polarization and improve insulin sensitivity in mouse adipose tissue."}
