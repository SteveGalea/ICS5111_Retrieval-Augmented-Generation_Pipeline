{"summary": "heptatitis B virus (DHBV) can naturally infect primary duck hepatocytes. it provides valuable model systems for studying hepadnavirus infection in vitro. the effects of hepadnavirus infection on hepatocytes were investigated. more than 350 million individuals are HBV carriers worldwide. over one-third develop serious liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. major obstacles in HBV research have been the inability of the virus to infect cells in vitro. DHBV infection of PDHs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-DHBV preS monoclonal antibody. at 12 h and 24 h after infection, only a few cells showed fluorescence. at 72 h post-infection about 30% expressed viral large surface antigen. DHBV infected PDHs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining with mouse anti-DHBV preS mAb. cells were stained with DAPI and visualized by confocal microscopy. the symbol \"p.i\" represents DHBV post-infection PDHs. differentially expressed protein spots on 2-DE gels were identified by MS/MS analysis. gels of B, D, F and A, C, E represent 2-DE gels obtained from DHBV infected and uninfected PDHs at 24, 72 and 120 h post-infection. protein spot 49 (MW 31 kDa and pI of 5.45) and spot 50 (MW 10 kDa and pI of 5.78) down-regulated in DHBV-infected PDHs were both identified as annexin A2. up-regulated protein spot 26 (MW 65 kDa and pI of 6.61) and spot 27 (MW 66 kDa and pI of 6.4) were matched to lamin A (theoretic gi|37698402 131 34.8/25 8.71/7.80 1 0.5 N 6 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH) Columba livia gi|6016077 94 35.7/12 8.71/5.79 1 1 0.2 7 Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 Gallus gallus gi|45384486 231 44.7/42 8.31/5.66 2.5 72 52.7/24 6.58/5.45 1 1.2 0.5 Amino acid metabolism 16 unnamed protein product Mus musculus gi|74183518 118 35.8/28 6.84/6.80 1.5 1 1 17 similar to betaine homocysteine methyl transferase Gallus gallus gi|50755288 96 45/44 7.56/6.80 1.5 2 1.5 18 Pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase isoform 1 Canis lupus familiaris gi|73961895 241 20.5/15 4.62/3.80 1 1 A/Ng 29 similar to HSPC162(dynein, light chain) Gallus gallus gi|50758587 86 10.9/11 6.58/5.79 0.5 1 0.33 30 Collapsin response mediator protein-2B Gallus gallus gi|33340025 173 62.2/69 6.05/6.12 N 58kDa glucose regulated protein precursor Gallus gallus gi|45382769 471 72/96 5.12/5.00 N A/N 1 39 Chaperonin containing TCP1, subunit 6A (zeta 1) Gallus gallus gi|57525300 211 57.6/65 6.36/6.60 1 2 1.3 40 58kDa glucose regulated protein precursor Gallus gallus gi|45383890 251 56.1/62 protein score was from MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. the proteins that had a statistically significant score great than 72 (p 0.05) were considered identified.
