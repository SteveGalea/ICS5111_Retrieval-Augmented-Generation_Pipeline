{"summary": "adenoviruses (AdVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses with a nonenveloped icosahedral capsid, 60 to 100 nm in size, and a genome of 26 to 45 kb. they have a wide host range among vertebrates, including human and nonhuman primates (1\u20134) a novel BtAdV, BtAdV-TJM, was isolated from myotis davidii (2). this is the first genome-wide profile of BtAdV in its host across 5 time points. unique transcriptional features of BtAdV were revealed by quantitative PCR. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen) first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) PCR was performed using the cDNAs transcribed from the infected cells at 18 h p.i. with different sets of primers located within predicted exons of E1A, IVa-2, pol, E4 6/7, pTP, and 33K. PCR products shorter than those expected from unspliced mRNA were exact from agarose gel and sequenced with the specific primers. quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on the same sets of RNA samples which had been used in the RNA-seq analysis. qRT-PCR primers of target genes were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) 1 g total RNA from each time point was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) and used for qPCR. RNA was extracted from infected cells at 0, 6, 8, 12, and 18 h p.i. mRNA was fragmented by addition of 5 fragmentation buffer. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using the cDNAs transcribed from the infected cells at 18 h p.i. with different sets of primers located within predicted exons of E1A, IVa-2, pol, E4 6/7, pTP, and 33K. no more than three nucleotide mismatches allowed.
