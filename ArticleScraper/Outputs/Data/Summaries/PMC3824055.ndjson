{"summary": "mice were inoculated intranasally at 8\u201312 weeks of age with C. pulmonis strain CT7 (106 colony-forming units [CFUs]) mice were killed at intervals up to 14 days. mycoplasma pulmonis organisms were cocultured with activated Ctsl (1 or 10 g/ml) for 2 hours, then frozen at 80\u00b0C. colonies were counted after 13 days at 37\u00b0C. ocal microscopy: area densities of lymphatic and blood vessels measured by stereological point counting. Detection of Lung Fibrosis To determine whether Ctsl/ mice are prone to develop lung and airway fibrosis after infection, lung and airway tissue sections were stained with Masson trichrome. the 26-point score was based on the extent of peribronchiolar and peribronchial infiltrates, luminal exudates, perivascular inflammation, and pneumonia. mycoplasma pulmonis organisms were cocultured with activated Ctsl (1 or 10 g/ml) for 2 hours, and then frozen at 80\u00b0C. for 2 weeks were subjected to immunosorbent assays (31), as detailed in the online supplement. area densities of lymphatic and blood vessels were measured by stereological point counting, as detailed in the online supplement. four (of 18) infected Ctsl/ mice died at times indicated by arrowheads, versus zero (of 15) Ctsl+/+ mice. no deaths occurred in sham-infected mice. 4 Ctsl+/+ + M.p. 151 3 3.3 1.3 29 5 Ctsl/ + M.p. 211 17* 4.9 0.6 14 2* 7 Ctsl+/+ + medium 139 7 2.4 0.7 30 9 Ctsl/ + medium 135 1 1.7 0.3 26 9 Ctsl+/+ + M.p. 504 44 6.8 0.8* 6 1 14 Ctsl+/+ + medium 127 5 bronchitis and pneumonia appeared earlier and were more severe during the first week of infection in mycoplasma-infected mice. bronchitis and pneumonia appeared earlier and were more severe during the first week of infection in mycoplasma-infected mice than in Ctsl+/+ mice. infiltrates were compared in lungs of Ctsl+/+ (+/+) and Ctsl+ (/) mice. the maximum score on this scale is 26. values represent means SEM (n = 4\u20135). mycoplasma burden in Ctsl/ mice was higher at 7 and 14 days after infection. titer increased to 16,700 4,700 CFUs after incubation with buffer alone. 16,000 5,300 CFUs after incubation with 1 g/ml Ctsl. mycoplasma colony-forming units (CFUs) were measured in lung homogenates from Ctsl+/+ (+/+) and Ctsl/ (/) mice before infection and 3, 7, and 14 days after intranasal inoculation with live M. pulmonis or medium alone (sham) no CFUs were detected in lungs of uninfected/sham-infected mice.

Ctsl activity is increased in mouse corneas after infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. the increase correlates well with the inflammatory response (32) in cancer studies, cathepsin activity localized to areas of tumors, and was possibly attributable to production by immune cells participating in an antitumor response. coplasma in lung extracts were higher in Ctsl/ mice than in Ctsl+/+ mice at these time points. this might suggest a deficit of antibody production relative to antigen burden. however, the similar responses to an injection of heat-killed mycoplasma. remodeled airway lymphatics has been found after remodeled blood vessels regressed. proteases are important for new vessel formation because sprouting endothelial cells penetrate the extracellular matrix, which consists of laminin, fibronectin, collagens. the inability of splenocytes from infected Ctsl/ mice to produce IFN- in response to mycoplasma antigen suggests a possible defect in cell-mediated immune responses. a deficit of the antigen-stimulated production of IFN-, which is a macrophage-activation factor, could blunt macrophage responses to mycoplasma."}
