{"summary": "methods Thirty participants at a midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios. participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off) the study was reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. participants were assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios. the first 10 participants used standard gloves and 3 gown designs. a priori (deductive) and emergent (inductive) codes were overarching themes. the emergent codes were subthemes identified within each overarching theme. a second coder randomly selected and coded 2 transcripts from each simulation scenario. study was part of a larger simulation study to investigate doffing practices with methods that include task analysis, contamination count and location analysis, eye tracking, basic anthropometry measurements. the study was reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. study was conducted in a simulation room where the whole sequence was video-recorded from 4 angles. participants asked open-ended questions to explain their doffing approach and to share what they were thinking about or paying attention to at each step in the process. the interviews were audio-recorded (after obtaining verbal consent) and transcribed verbatim. doffing strategies focused on how participants generally approached doffing PPE. cognitive processes focused on what participants thought about or paid attention to while doffing PPE. barriers and facilitators addressed factors that helped or hindered doffing. in class we were trained to just rip it [the gown] off. but with this one I felt that I needed to untie it first. since the other one was tied in the back, I figured it would be easier to tear it off. physician: it's the most difficult part for me... you try not to contaminate, but then your glasses are there and you don\u2019t know what to do. if you get your arms in there, you can almost grip it from the inside. doffing strategies identified 2 subthemes of doffing strategies. most participants described trying to doff safely and minimize the likelihood of self-contamination. doffing expediently involved approaches to doffing PPE quickly and with minimal burden. participants who described both strategies did not specify which strategy was their priority. some noted that doffing expediently could undermine safety. doffing expediently was less commonly reported by physicians (2/6) than other HCWs. participants tended to improvise approaches that made sense to them. tracking contaminated surfaces and looking for design cues were more common with gowns than masks and gloves. participants identified the fasteners (eg, bands, straps) on masks and gowns as particularly problematic. 2 participants found tighter-fitting gowns harder to doff, while 2 found looser-fitting gowns harder to doff. participants also identified personal barriers (n = 10), such as wearing personal items (glasses, watches, and having mobility issues. some participants admitted they struggled to recall the correct doffing approach. doffing expediently was less commonly reported by physicians (2/6) than other HCWs (15/24). doffing expediently was less commonly reported by physicians (2/6) than other HCWs (15/24). four participants described relying on muscle memory and not thinking much at all when doffing gloves. improvising was more common with masks and gowns than with gloves. improvising was more common with masks and gowns than with gloves. barriers and facilitators typically pertained to PPE design. 2 participants found tighter-fitting gowns harder to doff, while 2 found looser-fitting gowns harder to doff. participants also identified personal barriers (n = 10), such as wearing personal items (glasses, watches), having long hair, and having mobility issues. some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. researchers found differences between groups of HCWs. physicians were less likely to report doffing expediently. differences in salience could be due to differences in clinical practice workflows. new doffing methods and additional training may be required to optimize doffing of redesigned PPE. new PPE designs and doffing methods also must be rigorously tested. if HCWs use work-arounds to avoid doffing, it may be prudent to design PPE that leads to less work-arounds. training protocols should accommodate HCWs\u2019 level of experience and the work they perform. hospitals should consider assembling interdisciplinary teams to periodically review and revise their PPE protocols [16] a simulation study may have influenced participants to pay closer attention to doffing and particularly to avoiding self-contamination. we could not account for the range of tasks and circumstances that HCWs encounter in day-to-day practice. therefore, we may have not explored the full range of factors that influence HCWs\u2019 PPE doffing practice."}
