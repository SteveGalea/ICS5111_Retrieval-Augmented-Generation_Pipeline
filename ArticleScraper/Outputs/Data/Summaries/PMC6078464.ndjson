{"summary": "Nidoviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded, and enveloped RNA viruses with genome sizes ranging from 12.7 to 31.7 kb. these viruses include the families of Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae (1\u20133). nsps are associated with the production of dsRNA intermediates and can sequester them away from host dsRNA sensors to prevent the activation of the host innate immune response. nsp15 cooperates with the viral replication complex to limit the exposure of viral dsRNA to host dsRNA sensors, thereby enabling the evasion of the host cell immune system. the active sites of three catalytic residues in NendoU are highly conserved in its counterpart, XendoU (19, 24), an endoribonuclease found in eukaryotes that processes the intron-encoded box C/D U16 small nucleolar RNA from its host pre-mRNA. XendoU is a monomer and requires Mn2+ (29, 30) except for turkey coronavirus nsp15, the failure of nsp15 to fold correctly may play an indirect role in viral replication by affecting proteolytic processing of neighboring components by preventing itself from folding correctly. this finding was confirmed for the nsp15s in several coronaviruses, including those of MHV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and turkey coronavirus nsp15 (25, 27, 33, 34) the disruption of the hexameric state of nsp15 can indirectly impact the two reactive histidines, namely His-234 and His-249, thus abolishing its enzymatic activity. in this study, we performed oligomeric and functional analyses of PDCoV nsp15 to elucidate the mechanism underlying the function of NendoU during nidovirus replication. the predicted three-dimensional structure of PDCoV nsp15 was built in the SWISS MODEL website. it consists of six monomers depicted and marked in PyMOL software with yellow, magenta, green, orange, cyan, and light blue for monomers A\u2013F. amino acid sequence alignment of PDCoV, SARS-CoV, and PDCoV nsp15s are shown with red and green arrows. conservative sites of three catalytic sites and four binding sites are indicated with red and green arrows. several substrate-binding sites present in PDCoV nsp15 (Thr-273, Asp-276, Asp-305, and Tyr-323) were also conserved at the equivalent sites in SARS-CoV nsp15 (ser-293, Asp-296, Asp-323, and Tyr-342) according to the conserved catalytic sites, the nsp15 mutants were constructed based on amino acid sequence alignment. the elution volume is labeled as described in A. sedimentation velocity analysis of SARS-CoV nsp15 (black), PEDV nsp15 (green), and PDCoV nsp15 (red) with their major peaks of hexamers (218.0 and 187.0 kDa), dimers (81.1 kDa), and monomers (37.5 kDa) dimers and monomers occupied 36.1 and 47.5%, with a predicted mass of 81.1 and 37.5 kDa, respectively. the calculated masses and the sedimentation coefficient (s20, w) data are shown in Table 1.

XendoU and SARS-CoV nsp15 have been reported to be a monomer. a similar structural feature on the CTD was found and reflected by the highly conserved catalytic sites of the active loop. a similar structural feature on the CTD was found and reflected by the highly conserved catalytic sites of the active loop. PDCoV nsp15 was an exception for being composed of dimers and monomers among other nsp15s. monomeric forms of XendoU (PDB code 2C1W), PRRSV nsp11 (PDB code 5DA1), PDCoV nsp15 (predicted structure), and SARS-CoV nsp15 (PDB code 2H85) are shown in yellow. the active loop and supporting loop of SARS-CoV nsp15 are shown in magenta and green, respectively. the active loop and supporting loop of XendoU are shown in red and blue, respectively. the dimeric nsp11 is in yellow and magenta, and the hexameric Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses nsp15s are shown in different colors. the conserved biofunction of NendoU relies on the conserved catalytic sites (two histidines and one lysine) the stability of the catalytic center in NendoU is the primary requirement to maintain its natural enzymatic capacity. the region (His-251\u2013Val-261) is 10 amino acids shorter than the equivalent region (Asp-259\u2013Phe-279) on SARS-CoV nsp15. further investigations of nsp15s need to be performed to verify whether their different oligomeric forms impact their biofunction. nidoriviruses may acquire this gene from XendoU in eukaryotic cells. the different oligomeric characteristics of XendoU and NendoU further support this hypothesis. PDCoV is the second oldest among the four genera. approximately half of the proteins could interact with other copies of themselves and assemble into homomeric complexes. the predicted three-dimensional structure of PDCoV nsp15 was accomplished in the SWISS-MODEL website (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) the structural figures were generated with the PyMOL molecular visualization system (Schr\u00f6dinger) several important sequences of Phe-145\u2013Ile-164 and His-251\u2013Val-261 on PDCoV nsp15 were replaced by the equivalent sequences of Thr-152\u2013Phe-179 and Asp-259\u2013Phe-279 on SARS-CoV nsp15. these constructs were cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector by homologous recombination with a C-terminal GST tag for the en LB medium containing 50 g/ml ampicillin was used for cells expressing proteins with His6 tags. cells were induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. 1 mg of each protein was purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid high-affinity filter. the eluted proteins were then assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. the predicted weight-averaged molar masses were calculated using DNASTAR software. 69A, D276A, and N-terminal truncated were mixed with 1 m RNA substrate (5\u2032,6-carboxyfluorescein-dA-rU-dA-dA-6-carboxy-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylrhodamine-3\u2032, purchased from GenScript Corp.) the same protocol was used to assess the endoribonuclease activity of the SARS-CoV n amino acid sequences of PDCoV, PEDV, and PDCoV nsp15s were prealigned on the website server of Clustal Omega (version 7.1) software was used to build the phylogenetic tree to visualize evolutionary relationships between Nidovirales and Coronaviridae. nsp15s were cloned from the PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014. a codon-optimized SARS-CoV nsp15 gene was synthesized by GenScript Corp.
