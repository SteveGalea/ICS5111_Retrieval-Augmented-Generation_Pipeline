{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen that causes human encephalitis and meningitis. the 10,976 nucleotides (nts) genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein which is processed into three viral structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. the ORF is flanked by 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions (UTRs) which contain many important degradation of the viral genome by cellular 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 exoribonuclease XRN1. a pseudoknot or a three-helix junction structure in the 3\u2019 UTR is responsible for stalling XRN1 degradation. degradation from the full-length genome seems uneconomic for viruses from an evolutionary point of view. a549 XRN1 knock-out cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 medium. the majority of plasmids used for this study were constructed by RT-PCR. cDNA encoded RdRp domain from amino acids at position 274 to 905 of the JEV NS5 protein was amplified. 5 105 HEK293T and A549 cells were transduced with shXRN1 or shGFP lentiviruses, respectively, and selected with puromycin (1 g/ml) at one-week post-transduction, cells were seeded on 60-mm plates (approximately 2 106 cells per plate) and infected with JEV RP9 (or DENV-2 as a control) at an MOI of 5 (for HEK2 nuclease assays Plasmid pGEMT-JEV-800 was linearized with Sal I. DNA template was amplified from pTight-DENV plasmid. 60 pmol of triphosphated RNAs were incubated with 20 units of RNA 5\u2019 pyrophosphohydrolase. transfected cells were passaged every 5 days if no apparent cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. RNAs were extracted at the time when the cells showed a severe CPE. the RNA-protein complexes were resolved by non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4\u00b0C, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham) and then cross-linked using UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) competition assays were performed using various amounts of unlabeled RNAs added to the binding reaction. TT, 5 mM MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 5 mM (each) ATP, UTP, and GTP, 0.5 mM CTP, and 10 mCi of -32P-CTP (3,000 Ci/mmole; MP Biomedicals) reaction product was denatured in 2X loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0. to 905 of the JEV NS5 protein was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET28a (Novagen) the lentiviral vectors expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were obtained from the Taiwan National RNAi Core Facility. blots were hybridized with the strand-specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeling riboprobe detecting JEV nt 10454\u201310976 or DENV-2 nt 10270\u201310732 made by in vitro transcription. the relative intensities of RNA bands on the membrane were estimated using Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm) transfected cells were transfected with 0.25 g of pTight-JEV (or mutant) plasmid, 0.25 g of pTET-OFF (BD Bioscience) and 1 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 200 l of Opti-MEM medium per well at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. transfected cells were passaged every 5 days if no apparent cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. binding reactions were set at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.1, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 units RNaseOUT) the RNA-protein complexes were resolved by non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4\u00b0C, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham) the in vitro RdRp assay was performed with 500 ng of the recombinant RdRp protein and 200 ng of RNA templates. the reaction mixture was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 hours. the reaction product was denatured in 2X loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromophenol blue, 0.025% SDS) no decay intermediates between viral genome and the sfRNA even in the wild-type (WT) cells. similar results were also observed in A549 cells infected with JEV. no statistically significant differences in the amount of the sfRNA were detected. the XRN1-KD HEK293T (A) or A549 (B) cells were infected with shXRN1. total RNAs were extracted at 72 h post-infection and Northern blots were analyzed using a DIG-labeled riboprobe detecting nt 10454 to nt 10976 in the 3\u2019UTR. a 3\u2019-terminal 800-nt monophosphate RNA derived from genome of JEV or DENV was incubated with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 unit of XRN1 respectively. incubation with 1 unit of exoribonuclease XRN1 resulted in the production of the sfRNA. the 800-nt RNA treated with RNase A was rapidly and completely degraded. the replication efficiency of the cDNA from different mutants varied. these results suggest that the mutations made in these regions delayed the completion of the viral life cycle. we then measured the virus titers at the time when the cells showed strong CPE that varied from 4 to 11 dpt for different mutants. or XRN1-knockdown cells (KD) were infected with a PK disrupted mutant (PK1\u201d) and a PK compensatory changed mutant (PK1\u20191\u201d) viruses at an MOI of 0.1. a PK compensatory changed mutant (PK1\u20191\u201d) viruses were extracted at 60 h post-infection and analyzed by Northern blot. bCells were passaged at five days post-transfection (dpt) and supernatant fluids were collected at the time of passaging. gene cyclization has been shown to play an important role in viral replication. three point mutations disrupted base pairing of the first pseudoknot at the 3\u2019 UTR (PK1\u2019 or PK1\u201d) prevented sfRNA formation. compensatory changes restoring the PK pairing (PK1\u20191\u201d) recovered the sfRNA synthesis (Fig 2C, lane 13) suggesting that pseudoknot structure is also required for the sfRNA formation. sfRNA levels of mutants measured at 48 hpi by Northern hybridization did not show apparent differences in comparison with the WT control. the replication-deficient mutant, which had the essential polymerase motif GDD mutated (NS5mt), was compared to the wild-type (WT) infectious clone. RNAs were measured by Northern hybridization with a DIG-labeled riboprobe. we assumed that its promoter would be located on the antigenome adjacent to the 5\u2019 initiation of the sfRNA. we cloned the cDNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide at position 10431\u201310566 of the genome. tRNA (lanes 6\u20138) and nonspecific RNA (lanes 9\u201311) competed away the RPC. results suggest that JEV RdRp binds specifically to the (-)10431-10566 RNA. the products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 6M urea. the numbers correspond to the nucleotide positions in the JEV genome. the first 160 nucleotides containing the 5\u2019 UTR and 5\u2019CS of the plus-strand RNA in DENV [34] and WNV [35] contain promoter activity. the larger band with 136 nt in length same as the size marker driven by T7 RNA polymerase. the smaller band with 113 nts in length presumably a transcription product initiated from the putative promoter. the recombinant JEV RdRp could recognize the promoter and synthesize the sequences. fRNA accumulation in XRN1-KD cells showed 112.5% 8.5% at 48 h post infection. no statistically significant differences in the amount of the sfRNA were detected in the infected cells at any time. nt 10454 to nt 10976 in the 3\u2019UTR (A, D, E) or an IRD 700-labeled JEV(-)10950-10976 probe (B) Total RNAs were extracted at 72 h post-infection. a riboprobe detecting nt 10270 to nt 10723 in the 3\u2019UTR. RNA degradation analysis of non-replicative 800-nt 3\u2019-terminal mono incubation with 1 unit of exoribonuclease XRN1 resulted in the production of the sfRNA. the 800-nt RNA treated with RNase A was rapidly and completely degraded. the stem-loop II (SLII) structure is required for the formation of the sfRNA. a deletion that spanned nt 10423\u201310729 (307) abolished the viral replication. the deletion of the AU-rich region (AU-rich) or the 5\u2019-stemloop (5\u2019-SL) slightly delayed viral replication but had no lasting effect on the viral replication overall. BHK-21 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1. the supernatant fluid of the infected cells was sampled at the indicated times post-infection. a virus titera in supernatant fluids collected at 5 days post-transfection. bCells were passaged at five days post-transfection (dpt) and supernatant fluids were collected. cSampling time for measuring the titer is indicated on the left column. gene cyclization has been shown to play an important role in viral replication. the requirement of the PK structure for the production of sfRNA does not rely on the activity of exoribonuclease XRN1, PK1\u20191\u201d and PK1\u201d mutants were used to infect WT or XRN1-KD HEK293T cells. mutations made at the SLII region apparently resulted in relatively smaller plaques. the NS5mt clone abolished the viral genome replication while barely any sfRNA accumulated. the NS5mt clone completely abolished the viral genome replication while barely any sfRNA accumulated. cDNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide was cloned at position 10431\u201310566 of the genome. we cloned the cDNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide at position 10431\u201310566 of the genome. no band shift was observed with non-specific RNA or BSA control. Uniformly DIG-labeled (-)10431-10566 RNA (0.25 pmol) or nonspecific RNA (nsRNA) from 5\u2019 152-nt of bovine coronavirus genome were titrated with increasing concentrations of RdRp (or BSA) from 0.25, 0.5, 1 to 2.5 M. the complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. the numbers correspond to the nucleotide positions in the JEV genome. the products are depicted as de novo synthesis or transcription products with size (nts) indicated. the first 160 nucleotides containing the 5\u2019 UTR and 5\u2019CS contain promoter activity. a smaller band with approximately 113 nts in length except for the (-)10454-10566 RNA. the recombinant JEV RdRp could recognize the promoter and synthesize the sequences. the accumulation of the sfRNA results from incomplete degradation of viral genome by host exoribonuclease XRN1 [24\u201326] no intermediate degradation byproducts from viral genome to the sfRNA were detected during infection even in the XRN1-deficient cells. several unsolved mysteries including the unreasonably high rate of nonsense-mediated decay to generate the sfRNA. the lack of economy in degradation from the full-length genome from an evolutionary perspective led us to reconsider other possible mechanisms of the JEV sfRNA formation. the NS5 protein binds to the putative promoter and produces a de novo synthesis product and a presumable transcription product of approximately 113 nts in length. we attempted to clarify the initiation site of the RdRp products by applying 5\u2019 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5\u2019 RACE) assays but failed to observe any specific sequences due to low amount of the radiolabeled products. sfRNA is likely made (i) by transcription initially by RdRp in conjunction with other host factors (HFs), and (ii) synthesized products could be further trimmed by exoribonuclease XRN1 and/or other unidentified enzymes. results revealed from in vivo mutagenesis studies and in vitro RdRp assays are quite consistent except for the template nt 10454\u201310566. this template contains the entire SLII region that is essential for the formation of sfRNA in vivo. this difference may due to that there is not enough space on the template for RdRp binding because RdRp is considered as a large protein so both de novo products and transcripts vanished when performed the a promoter element known as stemloop A (SLA) at the 5\u2019 end of the genome has been well studied. the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis includes the RdRp binding at the 5\u2019 end of the genome and the relocation of the RdRp at the 3\u2019 initiation site by long-range RNA-RNA interactions. a potential role of this CYC-like motif remains to be studied. online supplemental materials and methods for constructing plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis."}
