{"summary": "nidovirales are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. the two viruses belong to the same species, Alphamesonivirus 1, the prototype species of the genus Alphamesonivirus (family Mesoniviridae) (2). nidovirus 3CLpros share an N-terminal chymotrypsin-like two-barrel fold structure. ser or Cys (nucleophile) and His (general base) are used as catalytic residues. coronavirus and ronivirus 3C-like proteases employ a catalytic Cys-His dyad. us and others failed to identify conserved (Gln/Glu)|(Ser/Ala/Gly) dipeptide sequences at interdomain borders in mesonivirus polyproteins. the fully processed form of the CavV 3CLpro is a 314-residue Cys protease that is released from pp1a/pp1ab by cleavage at partially conserved sites. pMAL-c2-[pp1a-1343-1720-His6] was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides LT-1 and LT-2. pMAL-c2 backbone was amplified from pMAL-c2 plasmid DNA using oligonucleotides LT-3 and LT-4. pMAL-c2-[pp1a-1343-1720-His6]-derived constructs were generated by PCR-based methods using suitable primers and in vivo recombination. the resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and BspHI. pET-11d plasmid DNA (Novagen) was digested with BamHI and BspHI. protein expression was induced for 4 h at 25\u00b0C. the frozen cell pellets were resuspended on ice in 25 ml of the appropriate binding buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Roche) for protein purification, the frozen pellets were resuspended on ice in 25 ml of the appropriate binding buffer. cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 10 mM 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol [thioglycerol] and loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. the bound proteins were eluted in 1-ml fractions the proteins MBP-pp1a-1377-1700_H1434A_C1539A (3CLpro N1-C1) and MBP-pp1a-1387-1700_H1434A_C1539A (3CLpro N2-C1) were expressed in TB1 cells at 25\u00b0C for 5 h. cell pellets obtained from 500-ml expression cultures were suspended on ice in MBP purification buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 200 the coding sequence of 3CLpro pp1a/pp1ab residues Met-1374 to Asn-1699 was stored at 80\u00b0C. the purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), used to raise a CavV 3CLpro-specific antiserum in rabbits. soluble supernatant was resuspended in NP-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) after centrifugation, the soluble supernatant was collected. total protein concentration determined using the Bradford protein assay. pMAL-c2-[pp1a-1343-1720-His6]-derived constructs were generated by PCR-based methods using suitable primers and in vivo recombination. pMAL-c2-[pp1a-1343-1720-His6] coding sequence was amplified by PCR from cDNA using oligonucleotides LT-1 and LT-2. freshly transformed cells were grown in LB medium containing 75 g/ml carbenicillin until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 to 0.9 was reached. protein expression was induced in one of the cultures with 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) glutathione S-transferase (GST)-containing processing products derived from MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST were purified at 4\u00b0C using an ktaPrime plus chromatography system (GE Healthcare) to do this, the cells were lysed in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3 d in 1-ml fractions using a 30-ml linear gradient from 0% buffer A to 100% buffer B (buffer A containing 400 mM imidazole) the appropriate protein samples were separated in a discontinuous 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Carl Roth) the membrane was stained with 0.025% Coomassie blue R-250 in 40% methanol. a buffer exchange was performed using an anion exchange binding buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) and a PD-10 desalting column. the proteins were separated by using an ktaPrime plus chromatography system equipped with a 1-ml HiTrap Q-HP column. purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) at 48 h p.i., infected cells were scraped off, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) previous study identified a putative 3CLpro domain in the ORF1a-encoded part of the CavV replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (9) we also identified putative active-site residues, including a GxCG motif that was predicted to contain the CavV 3CLpro active-site nucleophile Cys-1539. about 40 and 37 kDa, respectively, were not detected in the controls (MBP-lacZ, 3CLpro mut, and noninduced cells) the induction of the expression of the MBP-3CLpro mut protein gave rise to only one overexpressed protein that migrated right in the middle between the 70- and 100-kDa size markers. the activity was abolished when the presumed active-site nucleophile, Cys-1539, was replaced with Ala. pp1a/pp1ab residues 1343 to 1720 harbor an active cysteine protease that undergoes autoprocessing at both N- and C-terminal cleavage sites. the putative 3CLpro domain is indicated in dark gray, and transmembrane domains are shown in light gray. cleavage products eluted in fraction 4 (F4) were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. all three cleavage products were shown to have the N terminus Ser-Ala-Thr-.... cleavage occurred at 1700Q|S1701 in the CavV pp1a/1ab sequence. a potential cleavage at the C-terminal site could be characterized by glutathione affinity purification of a larger (GST-containing) processing product. however, we detected three (rather than just one) protein(s) in the elution fractions. this indicates the presence of additional 3CLpro cleavage sites in the N- or C-terminal GST region. expression of the MBP-pp1a-1343-1720_Q1700A-GST protein revealed that C-terminal cleavage occurred nearly as efficiently as in the wild-type construct. in another attempt to abolish cleavage at the 3CLpro carboxyl terminus, we removed the entire C terminus from the MBP-pp1a-1343-1720 fusion protein construct. we replaced this sequence with a short linker and a heptahistidine tag (MBP construct lacked the C-terminal 3CLpro residue (Gln-1700) and contained a short C-terminal linker sequence, including a heptahistidine (His7) tag. cleavage occurred at 1386K|S1387 in the CavV pp1a/pp1ab sequence. cleavage occurred at 1386K|S1387 in the CavV pp1a/pp1ab sequence. processing of 3CLpro occurred between residues Lys-1386 and Ser-1387. the 3CLpro domain retained residual autoprocessing activity at the C terminus. the data obtained in bacterial expression systems identified FKNK1386|SAAS as the N-terminal and YYNQ1700|SATI as the C-terminal cleavage sites. we considered it possible that the CavV 3CLpro uses alternative N-terminal cleavage sites to release itself from larger precursors. we expressed the MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST fusion protein and mutant derivatives containing appropriate amino acid substitutions in E. coli. fusion protein constructs were used to study effects of amino acid substitutions at one of the N-terminal (N1 and N2) or the C-terminal (C1) cleavage sites. positions and sequences of individual cleavage sites are indicated. expression of the wild-type fusion protein (MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST wt) resulted in an unprocessed fusion protein that migrated according to the expected molecular mass of 116 kDa. a processing product that comigrated with the 3CLpro N2-C1 marker protein was detectable, suggesting that primarily the N1 site was cleaved. 69.8 kDa (if cleavage occurs at the N1 site) and 68.70 kDa (if cleavage occurs at the N2 site) inefficient processing of the N2 site resulted in just one GST cleavage product of about 35 kDa. cleavage at the N2 site no longer was detectable. the production of a processing product comigrating with the 3CLpro N2-C1 marker protein was no longer detectable. in contrast, substitutions for single residues at the P1 (Q1700A) or P2 (N1699A) positions did not interfere with the production of a fully processed form of 3CLpro comigrating with the 3CLpro marker protein. replacement of Asn-1385 with Ala significantly decreased the autoprocessing activity at the N2 autoprocessing site. Similarly, replacement of the Asn-1699 P2 residue rendered the C1 cleavage site noncleavable while P1-Gln and P1\u2032-Ser alterations alone did not abolish cleavage at this site. the data suggest that the mature form of the CavV 3CLpro is a protein encompassing pp1a/pp1ab residues Ser-1387 to Gln-1700. the 3CLpro domain was expressed in E. coli TB1 cells as part of the MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST fusion protein construct. processing was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. replacement of Cys-1539 with Ala abolished autoprocessing activity. also, replacement of His-1434 resulted in an unprocessed protein. the identities of the processing products could be confirmed by their reactivities with 3CLpro- and GST-specific antisera. it remains to be analyzed whether the two proteins represent processing products cleaved at the C-terminal (but not N-terminal) 3CLpro cleavage site in the H1554A mutant. the fusion contained either the 3CLpro wild-type sequence or the same sequence with Ala substitutions for single-amino-acid residues potentially involved in catalysis. the unprocessed fusion protein precursor (MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST), the N-terminally processed cleavage product (pp1a-1700-1720-GST), and the fully processed 3CLpro domain (3CLpro) are indicated to the right. in a previous study, we identified a putative 3CLpro domain in the ORF1a-encoded part of the CavV replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (9. based on its conservation in many viral 3C and 3C-like proteases, we expressed the presumed 3CLpro domain together with flanking pp1a/pp1ab sequences in E. coli. a second control, we expressed the fusion protein encoded by the pMAL-c2 plasmid. the total molecular mass of this fusion protein is 51 kDa. the total molecular mass of this fusion protein is 51 kDa, of which 42 kDa is contributed by the MBP sequence. kDa in cells expressing the MBP-3CLpro wt protein suggests it represents the N-terminal processing product of a 3CLpro-mediated cleavage reaction occurring between the N-terminal MBP and C-terminal 3CLpro sequences. the size and immune reactivity of this protein suggest that it represents the N-terminal processing product of a 3CLpro-mediated cleavage reaction occurring between the N-terminal MBP and C-terminal 3CLpro lysates obtained from IPTG-induced and noninduced cells were analyzed in a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (B) or by Western blotting using an MBP-specific monoclonal antibody. the products of the expression control pMAL-c2 (MBP-lacZ) and the mutant form of the MBP-3CLpro fusion protein (3CLpro mut) are indicated by filled circles. in the CavV pp1a/pp1ab sequence, the 3CLpro domain is flanked at its carboxyl terminus by extended hydrophobic sequences that, by analogy with other nidoviruses, are predicted to act as multiple membrane-spanning protein domains. in previous studies, related hydrophobic regions from coronaviruses proved to be toxic or tended to aggregate when expressed in bacterial or in vitro systems. nidovirus main proteases have a pronounced preference for Gln (or Glu) at the substrate's P1 position (16), we attempted to abolish cleavage at the C-terminal 3CLpro cleavage site by replacing the P1-Gln residue with Ala. however, expression of the resulting protein, MBP-pp1a-1343-1720_Q1700A-GST, revealed that C-terminal cleavage occurred nearly as efficiently Western blot analysis showed that only the 37-kDa protein eluting at higher imidazole concentrations in fractions 18 to 23 was detected by a His tag-specific antibody. the amino terminus of this cleavage product was sequenced by Edman degradation. the construct lacked the C-terminal 3CLpro residue (Gln-1700) and contained a short C-terminal linker sequence. the 3CLpro domain retained residual activity at the genetically modified C-terminal cleavage site, YYN1699AGSSGHHHHHHHHH. despite the replacement of the P1-Gln and the entire P\u2032 region, the 3CLpro domain retained residual autoprocessing activity at the C terminus. this additional cleavage site, LMNY1376|SVLS, was found to be located 10 amino acid residues upstream of the N-terminal 3CLpro autoprocessing site described above. according to their positions in the pp1a/pp1ab sequence, we named the two N-terminal 3CLpro processing sites N1 (for the Y1376|S site) and N2 (for the K1386|S site) the other marker protein corresponded to a processing product cleaved at the second N-terminal (N2) and the C1 site. the latter protein encompassed pp1a/pp1ab residues 1387 to 1700 and was called 3CLpro N2-C1. 3CLpro N1-C1, pp1a-1377-1700_H1434A_C1539A; 3CLpro N2-C1, pp1a-1387-1700_H1434A_C1539A. fusion proteins and processing products were detected by Western blotting. expression of the wild-type fusion protein (MBP-pp1a-1343-1720-GST wt) resulted in a single form of 3CLpro that comigrated with the in both cases, cleavage at the N2 site no longer was detectable. in the triple mutant protein NKS1387AAA, the amount of N1-C1 cleavage product appeared to be further reduced while a significant amount of the 3CL. the data further support the idea that N2 represents the primary N-terminal autoprocessing site of the CavV 3CLpro. incomplete processing of the N2 site or the presence of a 10-aa extension at the 3CLpro amino terminus interferes with efficient processing at the C-terminal autoprocessing site. the 67-kDa protein represents a 3CLpro-GST processing product. it was released from the fusion protein precursor by cleavage at the N2 cleavage site. cleavage at the N2 site is a key event in the autocatalytic release of the 3CLpro domain. total lysates from mock-infected C6/36 cells or cells infected with CavV-C79 were analyzed using a CavV 3CLpro-specific antiserum. a 37-kDa protein was detectable in infected (but not in mock-infected) cells. the protein comigrated with the 3CLpro N2-C1 marker protein. mesonivirus 3CLpro is a cysteine protease that uses a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (9) or a Cys-His catalytic dyad (8). we suggested that Thr-1534 and His-1554 are part of the S1 subsite (9, 11) and confer specificity for Gln/Glu at the P1 position of 3CLpro substrates. replacement of putative P1-binding residue His-1554 with Ala revealed processing products of slightly less than 70 kDa. the identities of the processing products could be confirmed by their reactivities with 3CLpro- and GST-specific antisera (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this protein was not processed at the C-terminal 3CLpro autoprocessing site. pMAL-c2-[pp1a-1343-1720-GST] plasmid DNA was used to express CavV pp1a/pp1ab residues 1343 to 1720 in E. coli TB1 cells. protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 18\u00b0C or not induced. total cell lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE. a mesonivirus nonstructural protein, the CavV 3CLpro, is thought to play a key role in proteolytic processing of the mesonivirus replicase polyproteins. a bacterial expression system confirmed the predicted autoprocessing activity of the mesonivirus replicase polyproteins. 3CLpro autoprocessing sites in mesoni-, arteri-, and coronaviruses. cleavage at YYNQ1700|SATI (the C1 site) is produced by N-terminal cleavage at. FKNK1386|SAAS (n2) and C-terminal cleavage at. YYNQ1700|SATI (the C1 site) sequences from 11 mesoniviruses (Fig. 6 and the legend to Fig. 6), 5 arteriviruses (from 4 approved species) and 20 coronaviruses. the latter representing all 17 approved alpha-, beta-, and gammacoronavirus species and another 3 yet-to-be-approved species from the genus Deltacoronavirus (4, 45) nidovirus 3C-like proteases have a pronounced preference for Gln or Glu at the P1 position. residues at the P2 and P4 positions are thought to be additional specificity determinants (16, 17, 19, 36, 37) asn is conserved at the P2 position of the N2, C1 and N1 processing sites. this suggests that the P2 position is the key specificity determinant in mesonivirus main proteases. we did a mutagenesis analysis of the N- and C-terminal 3CLpro autoprocessing sites. us and others failed to identify a conserved Glu/Gln residue at confirmed sites and predicted (8) mesonivirus 3CLpro cleavage sites. we and others suggested that the conserved CavV 3CLpro His-1554 residue and its equivalent in NDiV have a role in binding potential P1-Gln/Glu residues. this residue is part of a GxH motif conserved in many 3C and 3C-like proteases by forming hydrogen bonds to replacement of his-1554 residue with Ala prevented cleavage at the C1 site. cleavage at the N2 site (which contains Lys at the P1 position) remained unaffected. further experiments are needed to corroborate this hypothesis. mesonivirus 3CLpros have evolved properties that separate them from other nidovirus proteases. it is characterized by the lack of a conserved P1-Gln/Glu residue and the conservation of a P2-Asn residue. the mature form of 3CLpro is larger than that of other nidoviruses. roniviruses and mesoniviruses may lend additional support to the possible common ancestry of roniviruses."}
