{"summary": "over 200 overlapping peptides synthesized as candidate antigens from the spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were synthesized as candidate antigens from the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. a panel of serum samples from 13 patients clinically diagnosed with SARS were selected and refined. assay results were obtained within 3 h. signal/cutoff (S/C) distribution of center for disease control (Taiwan) SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) serum panel and blood donor serum panel tested positive for seroconversion by IFA. panel supplied by Boston Biomedica Inc. of serum samples with interference substances commonly found in processed clinical samples. serum supplied by national Taiwan University Hospital from patients associated with typical and atypical respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV (influenza, rubella, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) serum samples, including two normal human samples provided as nonreactive controls, were diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline with carrier proteins and preservative. plates were washed 6 times, reacted to antibody conjugate, again washed 6 times, and reacted to TMB. assay results were obtained within 3 h. a panel of 1,390 plasma samples collected from random blood donors in Florida before 2001 was obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center. additional specificity studies were conducted with serum that had serologic reactivities for bloodborne pathogens. seroconversion was detected by day 11 with an A450 of 1.638. the peptide-based ELISA showed an analytical sensitivity to earliest time of detection by week 2 and for duration of detection beyond day 100. the seroreactivities of patients 3 to 8 were also evaluated by a standard IFA method (24) for comparison. time of seroconversion from onset of fever was detected in all six patients by the IFA method. the cutoff value for the peptide-based assay was set as the mean A450 for duplicate nonreactive controls plus 0.279 (based on 6 SDs from the mean for these 1,390 normal plasma samples). none showed positive reactivity, for a specificity on the normal samples of 100% (Table 2). the 52 samples with seroreactivities for the pathogens tested negative. the peptide-based ELISA was evaluated for specificity on serum samples drawn from patients associated with typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. the site-specific antigens of the peptide SARS-CoV ELISA were free of cross-reactivities to the other respiratory pathogens. ELISA detected three cases out of 383 samples from Ho Ping and one in 50 blood samples from nursing aides at Yang Ming. none of the 190 serum samples from the two hospitals without nosocomial infection displayed seroconversion. peptide-based ELISA was evaluated for sensitivity to seroconversion on eight seroconversion panels obtained from national Taiwan University Hospital. patient/day A450nm S/C ratio SARS patient 1 Day 0 0.119 0.44 Day 11 1.638 6.09 Day 17 2.447 9.10 Day 38 2.749 10.22 Day 97 2.600 9.67 SARS patient 2 Day 0 0.068 0.25 Day 6 0.163 0.61 Day 16 0.345 1.28 Day 27 1.212 4.51 Day 116 >3.000 >9.40 aSARS. the peptide ELISA was further evaluated for specificity with a pre-2000 collection of serum samples from patients with seropositivities for bloodborne pathogens. the 52 samples with seroreactivities for the pathogens all tested negative by the peptide-based SARS ELISA, as did the 41-sera interference panel. the site-specific antigens of the peptide SARS-CoV ELISA were free of cross-reactivities to the other respiratory pathogens. no cross-reactivity was detected in samples associated with common non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens. the new peptide-based ELISA is equivalent in sensitivity to other immunoassays for SARS and can be detected after day 100. the synthetic antigens provide the advantages of high standardization, freedom from biohazard, and ease of scale-up production. the test is a convenient means to carry out widespread retrospective surveillance."}
