{"summary": "ANDV features a tripartite genome consisting of three different negative-polarity single-stranded RNA segments. the mRNA (SmRNA) of all hantaviruses encodes the nucleocapsid protein. 4 out of 5 genera in the Bunyaviridae family encode an additional nonstructural protein, designated NSs (16, 35, 51) the NSs protein has been identified in PUUV- and Tula virus-infected cells (16, 51) the expression of the protein has been predicted (17, 31, 35, 47) the expression of the NSs protein in the context of a viral infection is shown. SIA conducted as previously described (11) but using native or heat-denatured affinity-purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NSs protein. native or heat-denatured GST or recombinant GST-N protein was used as a negative control. the plasmid harboring the full-length S segment of ANDV (accession number NC_003466) was recovered by PCR using primers mFluc-1/mFluc-2 (Table 1). the amplicon was cloned into the pGemT-easy vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and cloned upstream of FLuc in plasmid mFLuc between the NheI and EcoRI sites. ds for expression of RNAs harboring translation initiation codons in different nucleotide contexts was achieved by PCR using a series of different primers described in Tables 1 and 2. To obtain the plasmid for expressing the N or NSs protein from ANDV, the N gene was amplified by PCR from the ANDV SmRNA using primers NGSTf/NGSTr or Nf/Nr. the NSs gene was amplified using otide was used as the template for a PCR using primers NSsOCf/NSsOCr. the amplicon was directly cloned into plasmid pcDNA4/HisMaxTopo. expression of a single protein from each plasmid was confirmed by Western blotting. c The A in position +4 with respect to the ATG of NSs was replaced with CTC. the A in position +4 with respect to the ATG of NSs was replaced with CTC. the ATG of NSs was replaced with CTC. the GST, GST-NSs, and GST-N proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL bacterial strain. the recombinant proteins were previously induced with 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 h. the supernatant was combined with 1 ml of fresh glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 3 h. the beads then were washed three times with washing buffer. protein concentration and integrity were determined by a bio-Rad protein assay. nuclease-treated Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) was programmed with 0.06 pmol RNA. reactions were performed for 90 min at 30\u00b0C using previously described salt conditions. 100 ng of plasmid N-DNA or NSs-DNA plus 30 ng of plasmid expressing RLuc were transfected as described above. for DNA transfection assays, 200 ng of each plasmid together with 30 ng of a plasmid expressing RLuc were transfected as described above. cells were resuspended in 200 l of cold RLNa buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40, and 10 U/ml of Riboblock [Fermentas] after a 5-min incubation on ice, lysed cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 400 g at 4\u00b0C. firefly luciferase was amplified in parallel with the housekeeping gene GAPDH. relative copy numbers of firefly cDNAs were compared to those of GAPDH using x CT. the primer sequences used to amplify FLuc and GAPDH were designed using Beacon designer software. the protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay. 20 g of total protein was resolved on a 15% tricine\u2013SDS-polyacrylamide gel. the membrane was blocked, washed, and incubated with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody. anti-His antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution and were incubated for 2 h. anti-NSs monoclonal antibody at a 1:800 dilution was incubated overnight. cells then were washed three times with 1 PBS and incubated for 30 min. the nucleotide sequences of the ANDV smRNA (GenBank NC_003466) were analyzed using the Bioedit shareware program (version 7.0.9; Ibis Bioscience, Carlsbad, CA) monoclonal antibodies were prepared as previously described (20) positive hybridoma cell lines were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ANDV strain CHI-7913 was propagated in vero E6 cells. supernatants were used to infect nave cells at a multiplicity of infection. dl hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dl poliovirus (PV) have been described previously. the ANDV SmRNA 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR; from nucleotide [nt] 1 to 127; GenBank accession no. NC_003466) was recovered by PCR and cloned upstream of FLuc in plasmid mFLuc between the NheI and EcoRI sites. primers 1AUG-W and 2AUGnss-W (Table 1) were used to leave the AUGN codons in frame with F amplicon was cloned into plasmid pGemT-easy plasmid (Promega) fragments were recovered by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI. amplicon was cloned directly into plasmid pcDNA4/HisMaxTopo (Invitrogen) d expressing Renilla luciferase was constructed by introducing the RLuc gene into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) the gene was recovered from the pRenilla vector previously described (44), into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) GAGCACCCTCCAAGAATTGC NGSTr Antisense GAATTCTTAGAGAAGGCTCTTGG NSsOCf Sense ACACGAACAACAGCTCGTGAC R-HantaR Antisense AGGCTCAAGCCCTGTGTGAC FlucS Sense ACTTCGAAATAACGCG GAPDHS Sense. s AUGNSs X/X 1AUG-X/2AUG-Xnss AUGNSs a wild-type nucleotide context of AUGN (A in position +4) and/or AUGNSs (U in position +4) were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (RIPL) strain. RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and its concentration determined spectrophotometrically by a nanodrop. RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gels. nuclease-treated RRL was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min prior to use for in vitro translations assays. cells were seeded at 55 103 cells/well in 48-well culture plates. DNA transfection was performed at 60% confluence by the JetPEI system. ng of plasmid or NSs-DNA plus 30 ng of plasmid expressing RLuc were transfected as described above. total RNA was extracted from cells 24 h posttransfection. cells were triedpsinized and resuspended in DMEM (HyClone) cDNAs were synthesized using 200 ng of cytoplasmic RNAs and the qScript master mix. a 20-l reaction mixture was prepared with 5 l of template cDNA (1/10 diluted), 10 l of Faststart universal SYBR green kit with Rox (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.2 mM each primer. firefly luciferase was amplified in parallel with housekeeping gene GAPDH. recovered RNA was resuspended in 25 l of elution buffer (Roche Applied Science) about 50 ng of total RNA (3 l of resuspended RNA) was amplified with the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR and platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers F-HantaS and R-HantaR. ase-conjugated antibody (074-1806; KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. cells grown on coverslips were transfected with ANDV protein expressing a plasmid (NSs-DNA or N-DNA) or infected with ANDV strain CHI-7913. the cells then were washed three times with 1 PBS and incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibodies using a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (172-1806; KPL Inc.) and a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibody (A-21429; Invitrogen) at a 1:200 dilution. analysis of ANDV SmRNA revealed an (+1) ORF initiating 76 nucleotides downstream from the N protein initiation codon, designated AUGN (nt +3 of the AUGN to nt +1 of the putative AUGNSs) (35). however, one major obstacle to demonstrate the expression of the ANDV NSs was the lack of commercially available or published antibodies against this putative viral protein. anti-His monoclonal antibody followed by anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody. results showed that the recombinant version of the ANDV NSs protein was expressed and that it could be readily detected by both the anti-His or the newly developed anti-NSs monoclonal antibody. a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (green staining) and a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibody (red staining) were used as secondary antibodies. cell nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue staining) commercially available polyclonal anti-His antibody and monoclonal anti-ANDV N antibody. stains of the polyclonal anti-His antibody and the monoclonal anti-ANDV NSs antibody colocalized. a new set of cells was transfected with plasmid pNS-ANDV. a new series of experiments were conducted using a different anti-His antibody. for this, vero E6 cells were transfected with the pNSs-ANDV vector. the expression of the recombinant version of the putative ANDV NSs protein was evaluated using a commercially available monoclonal anti-His antibody. a recent report documents the expression of the TULA NSs protein in infected cells. the expression of the NSs protein was observed in early stages of viral infection. at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection, cells were fixed. vero E6 cells were infected with the ANDV CHI-7913 strain. at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection (p.i.), cells were fixed and the presence of the ANDV NSs protein was evaluated. the cellular nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue staining) a series of plasmids encoding virus-like mRNAs were constructed. to this end, we constructed a series of plasmids encoding virus-like mRNAs designed to mimic the ANDV SmRNA. in the NSs RNA, the AUGN codon is out of frame (+1) with respect to the reporter gene. capped monocistronic RNA constructs mimic the ANDV S mRNA. these RNAs contain 21 additional nucleotides (5\u2032-GGGAGACCCAAGCTGGCTAGC-3\u2032; gray region) between the 5\u2032 cap structure and the first nucleotide of the ANDV smRNA sequence (black line) normalized N RNA FLuc activity was arbitrarily set to 1 (left panel) values shown in both panels are the means SD from three independent experiments each conducted in triplicate. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) was programmed using in vitro-transcribed capped N and NSs RNAs. results show that FLuc was expressed from the N RNA, confirming that the in vitro-generated RNAs were functional. the AUGN initiation codon is recognized and leads to the expression of FLuc in cells encoded by the NSs RNA was expressed. the 5\u2032UTR of the NSs-expressing plasmid is longer than the virus mRNA or the RNA used in the in vitro assay. similar results were obtained when DNAs encoding the N and NSs RNAs were transfected into vero E6, 293T, and NIH 3T3 cell lines RRL programmed with bicistronic dual luciferase (dl) mRNAs containing the internal ribosome entry site elements from poliovirus (PV) or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the intercistronic spacer region. the cap-dependent translation of the first cistrons of both dl PV IRES (Fig. 4B) and dl HCV IRES (Fig. 4C) mRNA dl PV (B) or dl HCV (C) bicistronic RNA was translated in RRL in the presence of the translation initiation inhibitor edeine. the relative RLuc activity for each RNA in the absence of edeine was arbitrarily set to 1 ( SD) the ideal initiation context is defined by a purine at position 3 and guanine at position +4 (21, 22) neither is found in an ideal initiation context (21, 22) a series of point mutations were designed to determine the role of sequence surrounding the AUG codon on translation from both the N and NSs ORFs. the AUGN codon was in a theoretically optimal K context. translation from the downstream AUGNSs codon was not abolished. NSs RNAs containing the AUGNSs-CUC mutation exhibited no luciferase activity. plasmids carrying the RNAs were transfected into HeLa cells together with a constant amount of a control plasmid coding for RLuc. results obtained in cells fully support conclusions drawn from the in vitro assay. initiation from the AUGNSs codon proceeds by leaky scanning. analysis of the ANDV SmRNA revealed an (+1) ORF initiating 76 nucleotides downstream from the N protein initiation codon, designated AUGN (nt +3 of the AUGN to nt +1 of the putative AUGNSs) (35) however, one major obstacle to demonstrate the expression of the ANDV NSs was the lack of commercially available or published antibodies against this putative viral protein. combinant version of ANDV NSs protein was expressed. it could be readily detected by both the anti-His or the newly developed anti-NSs monoclonal antibody. arrows indicate the initiation codon used to generate the recombinant proteins. a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody and a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibody (red staining) were used as secondary antibodies. cell nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue staining) the ANDV protein was detected by both the polyclonal anti-His antibody and the monoclonal anti-ANDV N antibody. stains of the polyclonal anti-His antibody and the monoclonal anti-ANDV NSs antibody colocalized. a new set of vero E6 cells were transfected with plasmid pNS-ANDV. the expression of the recombinant version of the putative ANDV NSs protein was evaluated using a commercially available monoclonal anti-His antibody. a granular staining of the recombinant His-tagged ANDV NSs was observed in the cytoplasm of transfected cells when detected with either the monoclonal anti-His-antibody or with the newly developed anti-NSs monoclonal antibody. the expression of the ANDV NSs protein was observed in early stages of viral infection (51). at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection, cells were fixed and the presence of the ANDV NSs protein was assessed. at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi, ANDV NSs protein was readily detected. RNA was extracted from ANDV-infected cells 2 (lane 2), 6 (lane 3), 12 (lane 4) and 24 h (lane 5) postinfection (p.i.) cells were fixed and the presence of the ANDV NSs protein was evaluated by IF using antibody NS2-5E7/D9. the cellular nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue staining) a series of plasmids encoding virus-like mRNAs are constructed to mimic the ANDV S mRNA. in the NSs RNA, the AUGN codon is out of frame (+1) with respect to the reporter gene. in both RNAs the expression of firefly luciferase (FLuc) is expected to be exclusively dependent on the AUGN or AUGNSs initiation codon. the viral NSs ORF has been replaced by the firefly luciferase reporter gene. in the NSs RNA, the putative NSs initiation codon is in frame with FLuc. in the NSs RNA, the putative NSs initiation codon is in frame with FLuc. values shown in both panels are the means SD from three independent experiments each conducted in triplicate. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) was programmed using in vitro-transcribed capped N and NSs RNAs. results show that FLuc was expressed from the N RNA, confirming that the in vitro-generated RNAs were functional. results show that the NSs initiation codon (AUGNS) can be recognized, allowing the expression of the FLuc similar results were obtained when DNAs encoding the NSs RNAs were transfected into vero E6, 293T, and NIH 3T3 cell lines. similar results were obtained when DNAs encoding the NSs RNAs were transfected into vero E6, 293T, and NIH 3T3 cell lines. edeine interferes with initiation codon recognition by scanning 40S-eIF2-GTP/Met-tRNAi complexes internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements from poliovirus (PV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) mRNAs were inhibited in the presence of 250 and 500 nM edeine. expression of downstream cistron mediated by the PV IRES also was inhibited. dl PV (B) or dl HCV (C) bicistronic RNA was translated in RRL in the presence of the translation initiation inhibitor edeine. edeine interferes with AUG start codon recognition by scanning eIF2-GTP/Met-tRNAiMet complexes (7, 14, 25, 26) the ideal initiation context is defined by a purine at position 3 and guanine at position +4 (21, 22) neither is found in an ideal initiation context (21, 22) a series of point mutations were designed to determine the role of sequence surrounding the AUG codon on translation from both the N and NSs ORFs. the AUGN codon was in a theoretically optimal K context. translation from the downstream AUGN codon was not abolished. NSs RNAs containing the AUGNSs-CUC mutation exhibited no luciferase activity. s carrying the RNAs were transfected into HeLa cells together with a constant amount of a control plasmid coding for RLuc. results obtained in cells fully support conclusions drawn from the in vitro assay. initiation from the AUGN codon proceeds by leaky scanning. the ANDV SmRNA exhibits an overlapping (+1) ORF for the putative NSs in addition to the ORF for the N protein. to facilitate experiments, we decided to replace the NSs coding region with a firefly luciferase reporter gene (FLuc) placed in frame with the NSs or N initiation codon. leaky scanning is said to account for initiation by the 40S subunit at a downstream AUG (23). leaky scanning is widely encountered in viral RNAs, where it presumably helps optimize the coding capacity (5, 23, 39, 40, 42, 45, 55, 55, 56) proteins differ greatly among the different members of the Bunyaviridae family of viruses. this report describing the expression of a new viral protein is expected to further propel research."}
