{"summary": "IBV is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl that replicates primarily in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [7], [8]. it is also responsible for major economic losses to poultry industries worldwide. some isolates have been found to be associated with renal disease. the IBV S glycoprotein (1162 amino acids) is cleaved into two subunits, S1 (535 amino acids, 90-kDa) and S2 (627 amino acids, 84-kDa) the ectodomain region of the S2 subunit contains the receptor-binding activity of the S protein. Beau-R-M41(S) is a molecular clone of the Beaudette isolate, an IBV that was attenuated after several hundred passages in embryonated hen's eggs. the virus was not recovered from tracheal cells following infection of chickens with Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) or for the H120 [32] vaccine strain of IBV. pathogenic strain of IBV belongs to a different serogroup as Beaudette and M41. it belongs to a different serogroup as Beaudette and M41, that has been an important problem to the poultry industry since the 1990s. otides from the ectodomain and transmembrane domain from IBV 4/91(UK) S gene sequence (GenBank accession number JN192154) and 136 nucleotides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain from Beau-R were produced as described in Fig. 1. the 4/91-derived S gene sequence was amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs infected with IBV gene and 944 nucleotides of gene 3 and M gene of Beau-R were sequenced using a variety of oligonucleotides covering the S gene sequence and adjoining regions of the Beaudette sequence. two DNA fragments of 2042 and 2300-nucleotides were generated from the IBV 4/91(UK) S gene sequence that overlapped at an internal AlwNI site. the 4/91 S sequence within pGPT-4/91S was introduced into the IBV genome within recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) VV-BeauR-S, which contains the complete Beau-R genome, minus the S sequence. this was achieved by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system (TDS) [28] rVV-BeauR-4/91(S) contained a full-length IBV cDNA. recovery of an infectious rIBV expressing a chimaeric S protein DNA from rVV-BeauR-4/91(S) was purified and used to rescue rIBVs in CK cells. five groups (n = 13) of 8-day-old SPF RIR chickens were used for in vivo analysis of rIBV BeauR-4/91(S) the chickens were housed in negative-pressure, temperature-controlled isolation rooms, with each group housed in a separate room. three groups of birds were inoculated via the conjunctival (eye drop) and intranasal routes. chicks were observed daily for clinical signs; snicks were independently counted by two persons over a 2 min period. birds were checked individually for the presence of tracheal rales, nasal discharge, watery eyes and wheezing. tracheas were removed from three randomly selected chickens from each group. both primers and probe were synthesised by SIGMA. the 10 l real-time RT-PCRs consisted of 5 l of 2x FAST Master mix. all reactions were performed in triplicate in a 7500FAST Taqman\u00ae machine. the experiments were performed in the IAH home office licensed (PCD30/4301) experimental animal house facilities. they were approved by the IAH ethical review committee under the terms of reference HO-ERP-01-1. Vaccinia viruses (VV) were routinely grown and titrated on Vero cells. the 4/91-derived S gene sequence was amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs infected with IBV 4/91(UK) and 4/91-derived primers containing PacI (5\u2032) and BspHI (3\u2032) restriction sites. the chimaeric S gene was generated using the PacI and BspHI sites present at the same respective positions in both virus-derived sequences. RT-PCR products were sequenced using a variety of oligonucleotides covering the S gene sequence and adjoining regions of the Beaudette sequence. two DNA fragments of 2042 and 2300-nucleotides were generated from the IBV 4/91(UK) S gene sequence that overlapped at an internal AlwNI site. the 4/91-derived 3389-nucleotide PacI-BspHI cDNA was then used to replace the recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) VV-BeauR-S contains the complete Beau-R genome, minus the S sequence. this was achieved by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system (TDS) in brief, vero cells were infected with VV-BeauR-S at a MOI of 0.2. rVV, rVV-BeauR-4/91(S) contained a full-length IBV cDNA. recovered rIBV expressing a chimaeric S protein DNA from rVV-BeauR-4/91(S) was purified and used to rescue rIBVs in CK cells. five groups (n = 13) of 8-day-old SPF RIR chickens were used for in vivo analysis of rIBV BeauR-4/91(S) three groups of birds were inoculated via the conjunctival (eye drop) and intranasal routes with 3.6 log10 CD50 of BeauR-4/91(S) in 0.1 ml serum-free BES (N, N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-amin chicks were observed daily for clinical signs; snicks were independently counted by two persons over a 2 min period. birds were checked individually for presence of tracheal rales, nasal discharge, watery eyes and wheezing. tracheas were removed from three randomly selected chickens from each group. the 10 l real-time RT-PCRs consisted of 5 l of 2x FAST Master mix (Taqman\u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix), 0.25 l of Multiscribe Enzyme (Applied Biosystems) all reactions were performed in triplicate in a 7500FAST Taqman\u00ae machine (Applied Biosystems) at 48\u00b0C for 30 min; 95\u00b0C for 20 sec; 95\u00b0C for 3 sec. 555 nucleotide differences and 6-nucleotide insertion were identified. a chimaeric S gene, consisting of the signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane regions derived from IBV 4/91(UK), was produced. the sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.1 [67] and compared using GeneDoc Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor and Shading Utility version 2.7.001. following TDS, DNA was extracted from four rVVs. all three rVVs were found to contain the sequence corresponding to the chimaeric S gene. one rVV, rVV-BeauR-4/91(S), was chosen for further work. recovery of an infectious rIBV was attempted using DNA extracted from rVV-BeauR-4/91(S) in CK cells. the allantoic fluid was then used for further five passages in 10-day-old embryos generating a stock of the rIBV BeauR-4/91(S) that was used for subsequent experiments. the first part of the experiment was to determine whether there were any clinical signs associated with an IBV infection. the second part was to challenge BeauR-4/91(S) vaccinated birds with 4/91(UK) to determine whether the rIBV could induce homologous protection. three groups of 13 8-day-old SPF chickens were inoculated with 3.6 log10 CD50 of BeauR-4/91(S) another two groups of 13 birds were infected with 0.1 ml of serum-free medium as controls. the birds were observed for clinical signs, snicking, wheezing and nasal discharge, up to 10 days post-inoculation. only very low levels of snicking were observed in two of the groups infected with BeauR clinical signs were recorded from days 3 to 7 post-challenge. the birds were observed individually except for snicking. the birds were observed individually except for snicking. 4/91 group to 0 snicks on day 6 post-challenge in the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 group of chickens that were primarily inoculated with rIBV Beau-R-4/91(S) and then challenged with pathogenic 4/91(UK) no wheezing was observed in this group of chickens. the control groups, BeauR-4/91(S):mock and mock:mock groups of chickens did not snicking was observed in 20% of the BeauR-4/91(S):M41 group of chickens. previous work showed that M41-CK caused snicking levels peaking at day 5 post-infection (1\u20132 snicks/min/bird) and wheezing levels of 90%, at day 7 post infection, in infected birds. fected with BeauR-4/91(S) and subsequently challenged with 4/91(UK) virus displayed lower levels of clinical signs when compared to birds infected with 4/91(UK). birds inoculated with BeauR-4/91(S) and subsequently challenged with M41-CK were not protected to the same extent. mock:4/91 group showed a significant difference in ciliary activity. ciliostasis levels were 2725% for the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 group. an average ciliostasis level of 7415% was observed for the mock:4/91 group. tracheal samples from three birds taken on days 4, 5 and 6 after challenge. total RNA was isolated from the epithelial cells and analysed by qRT-PCR. no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheas of birds belonging to the mock:4/91 group. Vaccine BeauR-4/91(S):Challenge 4/91(UK) 1/3 0/3 0/3 Vaccine BeauR-4/91(S):Challenge 4/91(UK) + + + Notes: Tracheas from three birds per group were removed 4, 5 and 6 days after challenge and kept in RNAlater\u00ae. a chimaeric S gene consisting of the signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane regions derived from IBV 4/91(UK) and the cytoplasmic tail from Beau-R was produced. the last 137 nucleotides of the Beaudette S gene were retained to maintain any interaction [18] of the S protein C-terminal domain. the ectodomain is composed of amino acids 19\u20131095 and the endodomain is composed of amino acids 1096\u20131164. following TDS, DNA was extracted from four rVVs, potentially containing the BeauR-4/91(S) cDNA. three rVVs were further screened by sequence analysis of different regions of the chimaeric S gene. RT-PCR results showed no rIBV present in P1 because IBV 4/91(UK) is refractory for growth in CK cells. 10-day-old embryos were inoculated with cell lysate from the transfected P0 CK cells. allantoic fluid was collected 48 h post infection from the eggs. /91(S) vaccinated birds with 4/91(UK) to determine if the rIBV could induce homologous protection. this part of the experiment required infection of birds with pathogenic 4/91(UK) as a control and was also the control for identifying clinical signs associated with 4/91(UK) for the pathogenicity part of the experiment. in contrast, chickens infected with pathogenic 4/91(UK) showed clinical signs associated with IBV from 3 days the group of chickens were assessed for the clinical signs snicking (A) and wheezing (B) following challenge with IBV 4/91(UK) or M41-CK. the levels of these clinical signs were significantly reduced in the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 and BeauR-4/91(S):M41 groups compared with the control group mock:4/91. tracheas of three randomly selected chickens from each group were examined for ciliary activity and the presence of IBV. the mock:4/91 group of chickens that did not receive a primary inoculum with Beau-R-4/91(S) and was challenged with pathogenic 4/91(UK) showed the highest levels of clinical signs. the mock:4/91 group of chickens that received the primary inoculation with rIBV Beau-R-4/91(S) but was not challenged also showed >95% ciliary activity on day 4 after inoculation. in contrast, the mock:4/91 group of chickens that had not been primarily inoculated with Beau-R-4/91(S) but were challenged with pathogenic IBV 4/91(UK) showed the lowest level of ciliary activity, previous work showed that M41-CK caused snicking levels peaking at day 5 post-infection (1\u20132 snicks/min/bird) and wheezing levels of 90%, at day 7 post infection, in infected birds when compared to an avirulent IBV. however, by day 5 post-challenge the BeauR-4/91(S):M41 group of chickens showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis) tracheal section homogenates derived from infected chickens were used to infect TOCs. tracheal homogenates derived from infected chickens were produced and used to infect TOCs. loss of ciliary activity, >25% ciliostasis, is indicative of IBV being present in the tracheal sample isolated from an infected bird. Ciliary activity levels were significantly higher in BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 and BeauR-4/91(S):M41 groups when compared with mock:4/91 group on each day. each data point represents the average of readings of TOCs infected with tracheal samples from three birds taken on days 4, 5 and 6 after challenge. trachea-derived suspensions were prepared from infected chickens. IBV RNA was only detected in one of the birds belonging to the BeauR-4/91(S):M41 group. re-isolation results in which infectious IBV was detected in TOCs. rIBV, BeauR-M41(S) was found to acquire the cellular tropism of M41-CK, but remained apathogenic, according to clinical signs, in infected birds. to extend this work, we replaced the ectodomain region of the Beaudette S gene with the sequence of another pathogenic IBV strain, 4/91(UK) the rIBV BeauR-4/91(S) grew in eggs and in TOCs, but was not able to produce infectious virus in CK cells. this suggests that it acquired the tropism characteristics of the IBV donor strain 4/91(UK), which unlike Beau-R, is refractory for replication in CK cells. the recombinant IBV, BeauR-M41(S), was shown to have its in vitro host range restricted to those cells in which M BeauR-4/91(S) contains the 4/91(UK) S protein ectodomain (comprising S1 and most of S2), conferred protection against challenge with 4/91(UK). criteria used to measure pathogenicity were observation of clinical signs (snicking, wheezing, wheezing, ciliary activity in the trachea, presence of virus-derived RNA (qRT-PCR) in tracheas. the overall level of ciliostasis observed from either group is low. the degree of cross protection among different serotypes is generally low. a pathogenic virus from a different serotype, 4/91(UK), induces protection against challenge. no protection was observed against challenge with M41, as judged by loss of ciliary activity, clinical signs and virus isolation wee not assessed. some heterologous protection against M41 was observed in birds vaccinated with the heterologous serotype UK/6/82, despite the 20% difference in S1 [55]. virus was isolated from tracheas exhibiting ciliostasis following a heterologous challenge. but up to three passages in TOCs was required to reveal the presence of virus, indicating that the amount of virus present in the trachea had been very low. heterologous vaccination sometimes results in protection. clinical signs, detection of virus RNA and re-isolation of virus there was a degree of heterologous protection, under experimental conditions, against challenge with CK."}
