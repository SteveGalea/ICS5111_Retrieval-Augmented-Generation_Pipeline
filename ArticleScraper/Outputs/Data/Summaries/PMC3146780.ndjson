{"summary": "successful immunization campaigns have achieved eradication of smallpox and rinderpest. infectious diseases still kill millions of people every year, with developing countries remaining particularly vulnerable. the development of a human vaccine from concept to licensure currently takes at least 15 years. governments in rich nations are investing less in infectious diseases control and research. investment in vaccines for NTDs has come largely from philanthropy. fears of lack of funding is reducing the size of the infectious diseases research community. India, South America, South Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East have risen in economic standing. many are investing substantially in state-of-the-art biomedical research infrastructures. pharmaceutical companies are increasingly seeking to manufacture vaccines in countries where vaccines are to be marketed. the re-emergence of killer diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in western Europe provides a warning that wealthy nations are not immune to the diseases of the poor. a versatile knowledge base and more frequent flow of information and technology transfer between industry and academia are essential, if public health measures are to fulfil their potential. pharmaceutical companies are primarily focused on developing interventions for infectious diseases that affect industrialized nations. investment in vaccines for NTDs has come largely from philanthropy. fear of lack of funding is reducing the size of the infectious diseases research community in some developed countries. the number of production units for manufacturing drugs and vaccines has expanded. the Developing Country Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (www.dcvmn.com) is increasingly engaged with supplying vaccines at affordable prices through UNICEF tenders to meet the health needs of the poor. the re-emergence of killer diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in western Europe provides a warning that wealthy nations are not immune to the diseases of the poor. a versatile knowledge base and more frequent flow of information and technology transfer between industry and academia are essential, if public health measures are to fulfil their potential. industry prefers tried and tested delivery platforms for new vaccines. this alignment leaves little to no room for innovative but unvalidated vaccine delivery technologies to enter the product development path. veterinary vaccines could lead the way in validating the performance of new technologies, establishing the amenability of the technology to manufacturing scale-up. the cost of good manufacturing practice (GMP) and associated quality control and quality assurance of experimental vaccines can be prohibitively high for academic groups. underlying high costs of GMP prevent important comparative testing of vaccine candidates in early-phase, proof-of-concept human clinical trials.

emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases. similar multi-stakeholder, publicly funded, GMP facilities could be established to provide a cost-effective means to develop multiple, experimental vaccine candidates. this could potentially cater for a wide range of new generation vaccine delivery technologies and could provide capacity for very rapid emergency vaccine manufacture in response to disease outbreaks. delegates from industry stressed that liability issues can prohibit the sharing of adjuvants used for commercial vaccines. but some adjuvants in the R&D pipeline could be shared with academic and public-sector partners. it was agreed that there is more scope for progress with regard to accelerated product development pathways. accelerated early-phase testing of new vaccine antigens and delivery platforms is essential to establish early proof-of-concept. in the exploratory phase, more rapid and high-throughput testing of new vaccine antigens and delivery platforms is essential to establish early proof-of-concept. industry requires a high-level of confidence in technologies and formulations required for product development if it is to permit early \u2018at risk\u2019 investment. the introduction of new technologies in such a manner could lead into innovative delivery and formulation approaches reaching routine immunizations over the course of time. the current situation where some innovative technologies lapse because they are not taken up by the industry. veterinary vaccine regulatory requirements could be less stringent than for human vaccines. new GMP facilities could gain crucial experience in the manufacture of animal vaccines. multiple vaccines based on new DNA-based vectors are now licensed for veterinary use. west Nile virus horses

for vaccine development will exceed those of traditional research grants. it was suggested that a much better integrated, multi-stakeholder and shared funding approach could help to accelerate early-phase vaccine development. lack of access to promising adjuvants has prevented comparative testing of many adjuvant formulations in pre-clinical and clinical studies. lack of access has had a particularly adverse effect on vaccine development for diseases for which there is limited commercial interest. industry requires a high-level of confidence in technologies and formulations required for product development. lack of knowledge about protective immune responses condemn many difficult and scientifically neglected infectious diseases to the \u2018too high risk\u2019 bracket. industry prefers tried and tested delivery platforms for new vaccines. infrastructure to support small-scale, proof-of-concept vaccine development is of high priority. underlying high costs of GMP prevent important comparative testing of vaccine candidates in early-phase, proof-of-concept human clinical trials. multiple vaccines based on the new DNA-based vectors are now licensed for veterinary use. in the human field, the first vectored vaccine, a chimeric flavivirus against Japanese encephalitis, is only just reaching regulatory approval. in the human field, the first vectored vaccine, a chimeric

Striking the right regulatory balance in the veterinary field will be essential to the future deployment and widespread use of accessible and affordable veterinary vaccines. research centre that operates like a business with product-focused goals. but with a not-for-profit financial model, it may encourage others to follow this direction. if successful, it may encourage others to follow this direction. for vaccines before pre-qualification was proposed as a means to accelerate vaccine availability. this will help establish a long-term \u2018pull\u2019 mechanism for new interventions in endemic regions. role of farmers and pet owners as primary customers for veterinary vaccines was contrasted to human vaccines. the wellcome Trust has expanded its funding portfolio to include joint ventures between industry, academic groups and PDPs. the partnership combines the ingenuity of academic research with the know-how of industry, aiming to integrate the best of both. improved priority setting and advocacy Establishing \u2018end-user priorities\u2019 was seen as one of the most critical issues needed to ensure that the vaccine development pipeline meets true needs. there was consensus that communication and engagement with governments and healthcare workers in disease endemic regions should start as early as possible in vaccine development programmes. government and private funders must be provided with evidence-based information about the need for investment in vaccine development and support for immunization programmes. a greater role was seen for national academies of sciences and learned societies in promoting scientific-based support for vaccination programmes. one proposal was put forward to set up independent vaccine information institutes as information dissemination centres committed to the improvement of public knowledge about vaccines. the \u2018science of vaccine implementation\u2019 is under-developed. long gaps between registration and effective implementation are responsible for the loss of many human lives. emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, etc. are investing more in their health-based capabilities. veterinary vaccines and second-generation products should lead the way for validating new and innovative enabling technologies. Regulatory agencies should be more flexible and innovative in setting up a system of tiered regulatory standards tailored to veterinary and human vaccines."}
