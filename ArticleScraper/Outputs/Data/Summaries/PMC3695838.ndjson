{"summary": "Biological networks are important for elucidating disease etiology due to their ability to model complex high dimensional data and biological systems. proteomics provides a critical data source for such models, but currently lack robust de novo methods for network construction. peptide networks are feasible and biologically meaningful using two mouse lung experiments and one human plasma experiment. a majority of protein networks are constructed using protein-protein interaction databases. however, manually curated PPI databases are regularly revised. unbiased de novo protein co-expression networks can be constructed. eigenpeptide prioritization is accomplished by correlating the eigenpeptide with sample phenotypes. taking peptides that map to a given protein defines a protein subnetwork. peptide nodes map to multiple proteins, rendering them degenerate. measures took place on post infection days 1, 2, 4 and 7. infected samples include five technical replicates per day. abundance measurements for 16,890 peptides mapping to 3,277 proteins were recorded. 2,845 peptides mapping to 685 proteins were recorded. 505 proteins were associated with a single peptide. 180 were associated with at least two peptides. module significance was examined using permutation testing. p-values are computed by comparing the mean topological overlap of peptides within a module to a similarly sized random peptide sample. for a given module with size n, mean edge weights are computed. concordance of peptides within modules Concordance among a set of peptides relates to the shared sign of the slope when regressed against a given variable such as time or infection status. a linear model is constructed for each peptide using a reference variable such as time or a phenotypic trait. a fold change cut-off of 1.5 was used to define peptides as up or down regulated. if both up and down labeled peptides mapped to a protein, then the protein was counted as discordant. the connectivity among peptides mapping to a given protein can be tested by permutation. a hypergeometric test was performed using significant proteins from the module. the universe is defined as the subset of proteins in the mass tag database. the universe is defined as all proteins found in the AMT mass tag database. peptides with greater than 10% missing data were removed. the infectious disease data came from the NIAID Systems Virology project. the protocol was approved by the local institutional review boards. the sub-cohort is focused on the sarcopenia phenotype. a subset of 68 samples from two phenotyped groups are used. the TOM is computed as TOMij = (lij + aij) / [min (ki, kj) + 1 - aij] where lij is defined as the dot product on row i and column j in adjacency matrix [a] and ki (the connectivity) is the summation of row i in adjacency matrix [a]. module significance was examined using permutation testing. the eigenpeptide has length equal to the number of samples. this vector acts as an overall summary of the module. modules can be prioritized according to correlations between the eigenpeptide and biological phenotypes. a protein sub-network is constructed by taking associated peptides. the number of connected components with discordant peptides dramatically decreases. a fold change cut-off of 1.5 was used to define peptides as up or down regulated. peptides with weak connections to the module eigenpeptide were removed (Kme 0.333) centrality filtration is performed to focus the analysis on peptides associated with overall module function. the number of observed PPIs within a module is recorded. we found that peptide networks share this topology (Figure 3) and have biologically informative graph properties similar to those found in gene co-expression networks. as the soft thresholding power,, grows, the resulting adjacency matrix increasingly fits the scale-free model. significant modules were correlated with phenotypes. correlation with biological phenotypes can guide the discovery of biomarkers. influenza network showed strong correlations with average weight loss. two modules showed positive correlation (p-values 2e-10 and 2e-6) and two modules showed negative correlation (p-values 8e-10 and 2e-15). network topology may be useful for resolving cases of degenerate peptide mapping. network topology may be useful for resolving cases of degenerate peptide mapping. 48 of 218 proteins in the sarcopenia network were discordant. peptides that were modeled against leg strength provided the most discordant proteins. in influenza, there were 15 (out of 115 proteins) classified as discordant. a range of significant pathways were found when defining the universe as all proteins contained in the mass tag database (5,521 proteins) the antigen presentation pathway alone remained significant in two modules. these pathways are important in the pathological progression of influenza, highlighting the relationship between network structure and biology. ly informative graph properties similar to those found in gene co-expression networks are shown to be approximately scale-free. as the soft thresholding power,, grows, the resulting adjacency matrix increasingly fits the scale-free model. correlation with biological phenotypes can guide the discovery of biomarkers. in modules where the eigenpeptide is strongly correlated with a biological phenotype, an upward trend is observed between the Kme of a peptide and the correlation with the given phenotype. the strongest correlations were found with time relating to progression of infection. influenza network showed strong correlations with average weight loss. two modules showed positive correlation (p-values 2e-10 and 2e-6) and two modules showed negative correlation (p-values 8e-10 and 2e-15). sarcopenia network showed the weakest correlations with sample phenotypes. peptide mappings Mean TO RandomTO p-value Sarcopenia 2845 685 0.089 0.004 2.09e-14 SARS 2008 707 0.025 0.004 2.2e-16 Results from a two-sample t-test between topological overlap (TO) of peptides derived from the same protein versus peptides selected at random. this result statistically shows that the connectivity for a protein\u2019s constituent peptides is far from random. peptides that were modeled against leg strength provided the most discordant proteins. in influenza, there were 15 (out of 115 proteins) classified as discordant. this reduced to 7 and 3 respectively after applying the 0.8 and 0.9 thresholds. if the universe is restricted to proteins with KEGG annotations, the antigen presentation pathway alone remained significant in two modules. these pathways are important in the pathological progression of influenza. identification of enriched pathways in these unbiased modules could potentially aid discovery of novel interactions or pathway members. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
