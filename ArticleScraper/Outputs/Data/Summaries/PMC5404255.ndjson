{"summary": "the public lost confidence in the medical system, and many avoided seeking medical attention despite developing symptoms. the department of health established a SARS Coordination Center to integrate resources and coordinate the academic, medical, and private sectors. in phase 1 (July 2003-March 2004), 22 responding hospitals were divided into 3 categories based on disease and hospital capacity. based on different scenarios of outbreak scale and disease type, some of the 22 hospitals could be activated for additional diseases. in 2008, the responding hospitals were no longer categorized as national, regional, and local. the tiered system of responding hospitals was determined to be impractical and was abandoned. in 2013, the number of responding hospitals decreased to 22 based on improved hospital capacity and readiness for highly infectious diseases. the network is divided into 6 regions, and 1 responding hospital and 1 supporting hospital are designated in each region. the network is divided into 6 regions, and 1 responding hospital and 1 supporting hospital are designated in each region. there are 134 isolation hospitals, including 21 local responding hospitals. the regional and local hospitals are responsible for taking in patients with category I and V communicable diseases (eg, smallpox, plague, rabies, novel influenza, MERS, Ebola, and other hemorrhagic fevers) by regulation the commander of the Central Epidemic Command Center shall decide the launch of additional appointed/requisitioned places. regional responding hospital has qualified negative pressure isolation wards. facilities and negative pressure equipment are inspected and validated annually. every responding hospital is required to formulate an emergency response plan for emerging infectious diseases. one option is to dispatch the support workforce to the local responding hospital. the other option is to transfer the patient by airplane to a regional responding hospital. the other option would be costly for the transport of the support team. the other option could increase the risk of transmission en route. there are 134 isolation hospitals, including 21 local responding hospitals. at the national level, the CDC designates 6 regional responding hospitals in 6 regions based on the isolation hospital list and a SWOT analysis of candidates. 3 other local responding hospitals in off-island areas receive funds from the Taiwan CDC. regional and local responding hospitals are responsible for taking in patients with category I and V communicable diseases (eg, smallpox, plague, rabies, novel influenza, MERS, Ebola, and other hemorrhagic fevers) each regional responding hospital has qualified negative pressure isolation wards, with 2 to 4 beds per million population and 2 beds in off-island areas. each region, 1 supporting hospital is designated from regional medical centers. a regional responding hospital is defined as the initial launch of isolation wards, the floor evacuation, the building evacuation, and the whole hospital evacuation. if the outbreak expands further, the commander may appoint isolation hospitals or requisition medical facilities to take in priority patients with emergency or outbreak diseases. the regional commander may request cross-regional assistance as well. all healthcare workers on the support list are required to participate in training courses, personal protective equipment (PPE) donning and doffing exercises, and annual simulation drills held by responding and supporting hospitals. the central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) for H1N1 influenza was established at the level of Executive Yuan. the mortality of H1N1 influenza in Taiwan was 1.8 per million. this was the third lowest mortality rate compared to other OECD members. one-fifth of that in the united states. no-notice inspections were also performed in regional hospitals and medical centers to understand current infection control measures. the inspection showed rapid patient management and transfer flow; good infection control, with physicians and other medical staff dressed in full PPE; and timely reporting to local health authorities. 6 suspected cases were reported in Taiwan before the WHO announced the outbreak over. the command system and the medical system are empowered legally to activate and coordinate isolation wards, medical resources, and manpower as needed during the early phase of an outbreak. the command structure connects public health authorities and the medical system to integrate medical resources and share information with coordinating partners. change in number of regional responding hospitals, from 25 hospitals in 2012 to 22 hospitals in 2013 to 6 hospitals in 2014. the changes create a more cost-effective network that still maintains flexibility and surge capacity during an epidemic. the center for infectious disease control and prevention in Taiwan was established in 2004 as an avenue for training and drills in public health, medicine, disease control, and anti-bioterrorism. the communcable disease control medical network has been tested and demonstrated to be flexible and have robust capacity in responding to epidemics over the past several years. this system has several strengths, which should be maintained. core clinical and infection control skills should be developed with reference to the WHO and other countries' guidance. strategies are needed to incentivize participation of frontline medical workers to ensure a robust response team. fair risk compensation payments for caring for highly infectious diseases are still a topic of debate. the control strategies of the CDCMN have been tested during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the H7N9 epidemic, and other outbreaks. the command system bridges the public health and medical systems to improve allocation of manpower and resources at the national and local levels. at the international level, countries could help each other to strengthen and build a more resilient healthcare system."}
