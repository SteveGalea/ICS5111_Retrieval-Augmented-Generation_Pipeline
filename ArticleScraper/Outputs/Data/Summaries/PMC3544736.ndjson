{"summary": "Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and district of Columbia of the united states of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are common and important conditions in cats. the most important mode of transmission of both retroviruses is through bites. there is great interest in developing diagnostic tests to identify vaccinated and infected cats. in some studies cats tend to have co-infections with both viruses [13,19], whereas in other studies the reverse was shown [20,21]. these contradictory results, and residual variation in sero-prevalence after adjusting for risk factors, might be expressions of geographic variation in the sero-prevalence [11] or unknown spatial factors. each administrative region was geo-referenced to latitude and longitude coordinates of the respective administrative region centroid. each administrative region was geo-referenced to latitude and longitude coordinates of the respective administrative region centroid. a choropleth disease map was used to visualize the spatial pattern of PMR. the ELISA test is able to detect antibodies to FIV as well as FeLV antigens at the same time. the number of tested individuals is the same for both infections. the PMR formula reduces to PMR = m1/m2. spatial scan test identifies potential clusters of high or low risk. a high risk cluster was defined as an aggregation of administrative regions with mean PMR >1 (i.e. neighbouring regions in which FIV was more frequent), and a low risk cluster for mean PMR 1 (i.e. neighbouring regions in which FeLV was more frequent) the screening serology for FIV and FeLV entails use of antigen and antibody capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). each administrative region was geo-referenced to latitude and longitude coordinates of the respective administrative region centroid. each administrative region was geo-referenced to latitude and longitude coordinates of the respective administrative region centroid. cats are typically tested with a dual ELISA test that is able to detect antibodies to FIV as well as FeLV antigens at the same time. the number of tested individuals is the same for both infections (i.e., n1 = n2). the weights for each of the 49 administrative regions were estimated as the mean of the total number of cats testing positive for FIV and FeLV infections in each region. the one-sided test was performed to identify significant high and low risk clusters. choropleth map of proportional morbidity ratios (PMR) of FIV to FeLV infection in the u.s. showed more frequent infection with FIV in the western and north-central u.s. than in the western and north-central u.s. choropleth maps of PMR and spatial scan test for evidence of high risk clusters identified similar areas of relative excess of one infection over the other. higher numbers of FIV infections were reported in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV infections. identification and segregation have been the most important tools in the control of both infections. previous studies have found differences in sero-prevalence across the us despite controlling for these factors. the observed variability in infection could be reflective of diagnostic submissions specifically to IDEXX laboratories. this could lead to admission risk bias, a form of selection bias, as is common with registry or hospital based studies. not accounting for coinfections would lead to biased estimates of the PMR. researchers have identified geographical patterns in the distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection among cats in the 49 administrative regions of the US over the period 2000 to 2011. these patterns might be an expression of geographic variation in the pathogenicity of viral strains that are not evenly distributed in the study area."}
