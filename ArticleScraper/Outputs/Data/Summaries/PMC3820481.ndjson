{"summary": "the term \u201csurveillance\u201d is defined in the dictionary as the \u201cclose and continuous observation of one or more persons for the purpose of direction, supervision, or control\u201d [2]. a public health system is said to have five essential functions. public health surveillance is considered to be an essential public health function [3, 4]. some major epidemics recorded in human history. it provides the necessary background and context for the discussion below. some major milestones and historical developments. the epidemic was ended by natural interventions, with winter frosts, and the \u201cGreat Fire of London\u201d in 1666 that destroyed and cleansed the neighbourhoods. in 1849, John Snow mapped cholera cases in London and found contaminated water from the Broad Street pump. the disease killed 22 million people, about twice as many as the 10 million. in the decade 1990\u20131999, a total of 6.6 million attributable deaths worldwide [18, 19]. in the decade 1990\u20131999, a total of 6.6 million attributable deaths worldwide [18, 19]. in the decade 1990\u20131999, a total of 6.6 million attributable deaths worldwide [18, 19]. the first record of an epidemic was made in 3180 B.C., starting the practice of collecting and recording data. the first record of an epidemic was made in 3180 B.C., starting the practice of collecting and recording data. 1766 Germany First link of surveillance to policy: Johann Peter Frank encouraged linking surveillance to public health policy. 1788\u20131799 france First declaration that public health is the responsibility of the state: leaders of the French Revolution declared health of the people to be the responsibility of the state. the idea of collecting and analyzing data dates back to the ancient Greek physician. he introduced the concept of categorizing illnesses as acute (short duration) or chronic (long lasting) he also coined the terms endemic and epidemic. the first public health action that can be attributed to surveillance occurred during the 1348 bubonic plague epidemic which started the \u201cBlack Death\u201d. the concept of systematic ongoing collection of mortality data was first used in 1532 when the town council of London started to keep a count of the number of persons dying from the plague. he was the first to quantify the patterns of disease and to understand that numerical data on a population could be used to study the cause of disease [31]. he was the first to estimate the population of London and to count the number of deaths from specific causes. he introduced the concept of proportionate mortality, or the proportion of total deaths resulting from the index disease. the plague ended with the \u201cGreat Fire of London\u201d in 1666 that destroyed and cleansed the overcrowded neighbourhoods. the first epidemic field investigation based on the diary of Samuel Pepys during the Great Plague of London, 1665 [49]. the new poor law is considered to be one of the most \u201cfar-reaching pieces of legislation of the entire Nineteenth Century\u201d [53]. he studied the mortality rate variations across the 12 arrondissements of Paris 1817\u20131826, by district, population density, and income. in 1836, the General Register Office was established in England and Wales to provide more accurate and complete mortality data [25]. anaesthesiologist John Snow (1813\u20131858) mapped cholera cases in 1849. he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street. in five of these cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street. systematic reporting of various diseases started in the united states in 1874 in Massachusetts [61]. in the 20th century, the u.s. has been taking a lead in the development of surveillance. the CDC was founded in 1942 as the Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities. in 1965, the director general of the world health organization established the epidemiological surveillance unit in WHO's Division of Communicable Diseases. in 1968, the 21st World Health Assembly established surveillance as an essential function of public health practice [39] 1968 world health organization surveillance implies \"information for action\" a critical word in this definition is \u201congoing\u201d; one-time surveys or sporadic studies do not constitute surveillance. the definition of surveillance reflects Langmuir's 1963 view. public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease or injury. a surveillance system should have twelve desirable features, including (1) evolving, (2) ongoing, (3) systematic, (4) population-based, (5) comprehensive, (6) analytic, (7) hypothesis generating, (8) early warning, (9) effective in information dissemination, and (12) equitable [7, 74]. surveillance is the ongoing, systematic use of routinely collected health data to guide public health action in a timely fashion. in 1662, Graunt suggested in his book Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality the need for ongoing systematic collection of data. he proposed the basic principles for data analysis and interpretation, although he did not conceptualize the link of surveillance information to public health practice. Graunt's method of data analysis was to reduce voluminous data to a few perspicuous tables. he was the first to recognize that there were more male than female deaths in London. he suggested that this phenomenon in London should be searched for elsewhere. this term is a good description for today's public health surveillance. it requires arithmetic skills for analysis of data and a keen political sense for interpretation of results. the 1986 CDC definition of surveillance reflects Langmuir's definition of surveillance. the 1988 definition by Stephen Thacker and Ruth Berkelman is very similar to the 1986 CDC definition. the 1988 definition introduces the new term \u201cpublic health surveillance\u201d. compared the distinction between public health surveillance and epidemiologic research. population-based epidemiologic surveillance stresses on the concept of \u201cpopulation-based\u201d. more recent definitions of surveillance, including the 2001 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [75] and 2006 Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) [77] definitions, emphasize on \u201cpublic health action\u201d. public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of health data for the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health action. records of major Epidemics in human history Public health surveillance dates back to the time of Pharaoh Mempses in the First Dynasty, when an epidemic was first recorded in human history [7]. the \u201cgreat pestilence\u201d is now known to have occurred in 3180 B.C. (Table 1). Table 1 provides a list of major epidemics recorded in history. it also provides the necessary background and context for the discussion below. 1348\u20131351 Central Asia, then spread east to China, south to India, west to Portugal, north to England (1349), Norway (1350), and Russia (1351) Second of three most devastating epidemics to hit the human race. the disease killed 22 million people, about twice as many as the 10 million deaths caused by world war i. the virus was isolated in 1933, and its vaccine was developed in 1972. in the decade 1990\u20131999, 6.6 million attributable deaths worldwide. the first record of an epidemic was made in 3180 B.C., starting the practice of collecting and recording data. the first record was made in 3180 B.C., starting the practice of collecting and recording data. the diarist Samuel Pepys recorded the weekly number of deaths and made observations on the extent and progression of the epidemic. 1741 Rhode Island First legislation for surveillance: the American colony of Rhode Island required that tavern-keepers report contagious disease among their patrons [30]. 1766 Germany First declaration that public health is the responsibility of the state. the idea of collecting and analyzing data dates back to hippocrates. he introduced the concept of categorizing illnesses as acute (short duration) or chronic. the first public health action that can be attributed to surveillance occurred during the 1348 bubonic plague epidemic which started the \u201cBlack Death\u201d. the concept of systematic ongoing collection of mortality data was first used in 1532 when the town council of London started to keep a count of the number of persons dying from the plague. he was the first to quantify the patterns of disease and to count the number of deaths from specific causes. the practice of epidemic field investigation began with the personal diary Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703) kept from 1660 until 1669. he introduced the concept of proportionate mortality, or the proportion of total deaths resulting from the index disease. proportionate mortality for plague was 81% (6102/7496) on August 31, 1665, which decreased to 61% (333/544) on November 30, 1665. the plague ended with the \u201cGreat Fire of London\u201d in 1666 that destroyed and cleansed the overcrowded neighbourhoods [9]. the new Poor Law system is considered to be one of the most \u201cfar-reaching pieces of legislation of the entire Nineteenth Century\u201d [53]. he published the report of 1834 recommending the reform of the old Poor Law. he proposed the creation of a permanent statewide public health infrastructure. anaesthesiologist John Snow recommended decennial census, standardization of nomenclature for diseases and causes of death, and collection of health data by age, sex, occupation, socioeconomic level, and locality. in 1849, Snow mapped cholera cases in London and identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump. in five of these cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street. systematic reporting of various diseases started in the united states in 1874 in Massachusetts. in the 20th century, the united states has been taking a lead in the development of concepts and models for public health surveillance. the CDC was founded in 1942 as the Office of national defense malaria control activities. the public health surveillance program is coordinated by the world health organization. in 1965, the director general of the world health organization established the epidemiological surveillance unit in WHO's Division of Communicable Diseases. in 1968, the 21st World Health Assembly established surveillance as an essential function of public health practice [39] in arithmetic, the validity of the data and the conservatism of interpretation requires persons with a keen political sense. surveillance means the continued watchfulness over the distribution and trends of incidence through the systematic collection, consolidation and evaluation of morbidity and mortality reports and other relevant data. a critical word in this definition is \u201congoing\u201d. the 1986 CDC definition of surveillance reflects Langmuir's 1963 view. it states that the final link in the surveillance chain is the application of these data to prevention and control. surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data. surveillance focused on infectious disease, then broadened to other topics, including chronic diseases. surveillance focused on infectious disease, then broadened to other topics, including chronic diseases. in 1662, Graunt suggested in his book Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality the need for ongoing systematic collection of data. Graunt's method of data analysis was to reduce voluminous data to a few perspicuous tables. using this method, he was the first to recognize that there were more male than female deaths in London. he suggested that this phenomenon in London should be searched for elsewhere. public health surveillance requires arithmetic skills for analysis of data and a keen political sense for interpretation of results. before 1963, the term surveillance was used initially in public health to describe the close monitoring of persons who, because of an exposure, were at risk for developing highly contagious and virulent infectious diseases. in 1963, the term surveillance was used to describe the close monitoring of persons who, because of an exposure, were at risk for developing highly contagious and virulent infectious diseases. the 1986 CDC definition of surveillance reflects Langmuir's view that surveillance did not encompass direct responsibility for control activities. the 1988 definition by Stephen Thacker and Ruth Berkelman is very similar to the 1986 CDC definition. population-based epidemiologic surveillance stresses on the concept of \u201cpopulation-based\u201d. more recent definitions of surveillance, including the 2001 CDC and 2006 Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) definitions, emphasize on \u201cpublic health action\u201d. the present It is useful to provide an overview of the current status of public health surveillance and its basic principles and concepts. for further information, interested readers can consult books written on the basic principles of public health surveillance. the 2000 book edited by Teutsch and Churchill was considered in a 2001 article in the American Journal of Epidemiology [93] as a wonderful one-stop source of information on public health surveillance. there are books on the statistical methods for public health surveillance and public health informatics [96, 97]. intervention development and implementation: develops public health interventions and strategies and allocates public health resources during public health planning [98]. (i) Demonstrate the need for public health intervention programs and resources, and allocate resources during public health planning [98]. (iii) Set priorities and guide public health policy and strategies [79]. (iii) Make informed decisions related to resource allocation [77]. public health surveillance starts with defining the type of data to collect (systematic data framework development) [74], then the public health surveillance process cycles through three stages: data collection, analysis and interpretation, and the timely dissemination of findings [77]. a step-by-step guide is available for the creation of a new surveillance system. the world health organization recommends a stepwise approach to surveillance that has a core set of indicators. the data collection stage begins by choosing the best sources and methods for collecting the data that are needed. examples are surveys of the environmental, behavioural, and biological risk factors of populations [94] data sources for public health surveillance include death certificates, case reporting, epidemic reporting, laboratory reporting of etiological agents, individual case investigation, epidemi field investigation, infectious disease markers surveys, demographic data, environmental data, hospital records, general practitioners records, public health laboratory reports, disease registries, drug and biologics utilization and sales data, absenteeism from school or work. more advanced data analysis for surveillance data are available [111]. users of surveillance need to know for program planning and decision-making purposes [77] public health decision making depends on three types of knowledge. surveillance knowledge includes statistics that measure health outcomes, health care performance, and other determinants of health. data and system architecture of a surveillance system should follow four design principles. automated, real-time, routinely useful, and locally useful. current surveillance practice is unable to address adequately either current or new challenges to public health. in 1965, the world health organization established the epidemiologic surveillance unit in the Division of Communicable Diseases. surveillance includes \"the epidemiological study of a disease as a dynamic process involving the ecology of the infectious agent, the host, the reservoirs, and the vectors\" the 1968 definition of surveillance includes \"the use of epidemiologic information\" population-based surveillance may come back full circle in the 21st century. it appears that epidemiologic surveillance may come back full circle in the 21st century. surveillance does not include the public health actions resulting from the interpretation of the data. the definition of malaria surveillance included not only case detection, but also the obtaining of blood films, drug treatment, epidemiologic investigation, and followup [152]. former CDC director William Foege felt an essential relationship between information and action: \"the reason for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on a disease is to control that disease\" surveillance is the routine tracking before (or without) an intervention (policy, program, or action), which can lead to the development of an intervention. there is a difference between a program's monitoring and evaluation [154] monitoring tracks changes in outcomes following the implementation of a program or project. monitoring is designed specifically to be able to attribute the changes to the intervention itself. a second surveillance system is created on the surveillance system itself. health information systems include a variety of data sources essential to public health. they may not focus on specific outcomes (e.g., vital statistics), are not ongoing (e.g., a onetime or occasional survey) or are not linked directly to public health practices. sentinel influenza surveillance can collect nasopharyngeal swabs from each patient at selected sites to identify the type of influenza virus. others propose that notification of all cases is only necessary for the very limited group of diseases which are rare. information for epidemiological purposes is required for a very wide range of relatively common infectious diseases. iii) Document the distribution and spread of a health event [36, 99]. (iii) Portray the natural history of a disease [36, 99]. (iv) Understand the economic and health impacts of a public health issue, and the nature and extent to which it disrupts communities [77]. a step-by-step guide is available for the creation of a new surveillance system. an indicator is a measurable factor that allows decision makers to estimate objectively the size of a health problem and monitor the processes, the products, or the effects of an intervention on the population. the health template was put forward in 1991 by the national Task Force on health information. it classifies health information into three major areas: individual characteristics, external milieu, and \u201chealth-affecting\u201d interventions. the definition of what constitutes a \u201ccase\u201d is important, especially in infectious disease surveillance [98]. data sources vary from country to country depending on the stage of development and sophistication of public health services and laboratory facilities. the world health organization's stepwise approach to surveillance collects data through questionnaire, physical measurements, and biochemical measurements. data analysis and interpretation stage includes expert analysis of the data collected to determine the occurrence of a health concern. information products/dissemination The final stage in the public health surveillance process is important for follow-up action [77] users of surveillance are those who need to know for program planning and decision-making purposes. surveillance systems should be evaluated periodically to ensure that it is serving a useful public health function. a systematic evaluation should address six aspects: importance [132], (2) objectives and components [132], (3) usefulness [127], (4) cost [133, 134], (5) data quality (accuracy, representativeness and completeness) [127], (4) cost [133, 134], (5) quality of surveillance system (simplicity [128], portability [127], stability [127], sensitivity [136\u2013141], predictive value positive [138, 141], representativeness [138, 142], and timelines the basic principles of program evaluation involve information, expectation, and attribution [147]. the basic principles of program evaluation involve information, expectation, and attribution [147]. a number of concepts in surveillance are currently under discussion. research, in contrast, is experimental in design, aimed at testing a hypothesis by comparing and contrasting groups. if we confuse surveillance with research, we may be motivated to collect large amounts of detailed data on each case. in the case of malaria, Raska in 1965 defined surveillance much more broadly than Langmuir. the WHO definition of malaria surveillance included not only case detection, but also the obtaining of blood films, drug treatment, epidemiologic investigation, and followup [152] former CDC director William Foege felt an essential relationship between information and action. evaluation uses the same methods as in surveillance to collect information. it compares the actual program impacts to the expected level. it also tries to attribute the changes to the development and implementation of the program. surveillance systems have the capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate data to public health programs and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the disseminated data. health information systems include a variety of data sources essential to public health and are often used for surveillance; however, they lack critical elements of surveillance systems. sentinel surveillance selects, either randomly or intentionally, a small group of reporting sources who agree to report all cases of one or more notifiable conditions. these designated reporting sources then receive greater attention from health authorities than would be possible with universal surveillance [160]. some propose that notification of all cases is only necessary for the very limited group of diseases which are rare. the health template was put forward by the national Task Force on health information in 1991. it classifies health information into three major areas: individual characteristics, external milieu, and \u201chealth-affecting\u201d interventions. the definition of what constitutes a \u201ccase\u201d is important, especially in infectious disease surveillance. data sources vary from country to country depending on the stage of development and sophistication of public health services and laboratory facilities [12], and availability of computers and computer networks [27]. data sources vary from country to country depending on the stage of development and sophistication of public health services and laboratory facilities. increase in disease occurrence, within a specific population at a particular time and place, represent true increases. increase in population size, improvement in diagnostic procedures, enhanced reporting, duplicate reporting, and other changes in the system can help interpretation of results. public health decision making depends on three types of knowledge. a systematic evaluation should address six aspects: (1) importance [132], (2) objectives and components [132], (3) usefulness [127], (4) cost [133, 134], (5) data quality (accuracy, representativeness and completeness) [127] and (6) quality of surveillance system (simplicity [128], flexibility [127], portability [127], stability [127], sensitivity [136\u2013141], predictive value positive [138, 141], representativeness [138, 142], and timeliness [138 the basic principles of program evaluation involve information, expectation, and attribution [147]. a number of concepts in surveillance are currently under discussion. these dichotomies are described below. a number of concepts in surveillance are currently under discussion. research is experimental in design, aimed at testing a hypothesis by comparing and contrasting groups. if we confuse surveillance with research, we may be motivated to collect large amounts of detailed data on each case. the burden of this approach is too great for the resources available for surveillance systems, he says. in the case of malaria, Raska in 1965 defined surveillance much more broadly than Langmuir. in the case of malaria, Raska saw surveillance as encompassing control and prevention activities [36] former CDC director William Foege felt an essential relationship between information and action: \"the reason for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on a disease is to control that disease\" evaluation uses the same methods as in surveillance to collect information. it compares the actual program impacts to the expected level. it also tries to attribute the changes to the development and implementation of the program. health information systems have the capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate data to public health programs and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the disseminated data. health information systems include a variety of data sources essential to public health and are often used for surveillance; however, they lack critical elements of surveillance systems. sentinel surveillance selects, either randomly or intentionally, a small group of reporting sources who agree to report all cases of one or more notifiable conditions. these designated reporting sources then receive greater attention from health authorities than would be possible with universal surveillance [160]. some propose that notification of all cases is only necessary for the very limited group of diseases which are rare. mental illnesses account for more collective disability burden in developed countries than any other group of illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease [174]. mental health measures are now included in established health surveys, but there are challenges not seen before. in 2001, the CDC began implementing the national electronic disease surveillance system (NEDSS) to better manage and enhance the large number of current surveillance systems. in 2007, 35 states had integrated public health surveillance systems as articulated in the NEDSS vision. public health professionals and government agencies will be able to quickly recognize and respond in real-time to disease outbreaks. new terms like \u201cinfodemiology\u201d and \u201cinfoveillance\u201d have been coined for the use of informatics methods to analyze queries from the Internet search engines to predict disease outbreaks [186]. public health informatics can introduce new applications to broaden public health perspectives, strengthen prevention in public health, and build healthier communities [188, 189]. rapid changes in telecommunication, declines in participation rates, increases in the required level of effort and associated costs are becoming key challenges for telephone surveys. it will be important to continue to improve existing methodology and develop new cost-effective and valid data collection methodologies for the future. a minimum set of statistical tests, common definitions of statistical tests, and rules for minimum cell size suppression. a number of methodological research areas to improve data collection in the 21st century have been suggested. methods of epidemiologic and statistical analysis have enabled more meaningful analysis and interpretation of data collected from surveillance. a number of methodological research areas to improve information dissemination in the 21st century are methodology to alert health professionals and the general public about forthcoming health risks. methods to put our current knowledge of risk assessment and management into perspective so the general public knows what health risks to avoid (e.g., publication of \u201cHandbook of health risks\u201d) and what healthy activities to pursue. there are at least 5 tools/processes for decision makers on public health actions. meta-analysis, risk assessment, economic evaluation, public health surveillance, and expert panels/consensus conferences. the world health organization has initiated consensus meetings at the regional and national level to review and reform surveillance and action systems. public health surveillance systems must be strengthened by allocating resources, including human resources, for the effective use of health surveillance data and tools. a greater proportion of public health workforce will need to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively understand and use surveillance concepts and techniques. international migrants bring with them their cooking styles, hygiene practices, and so forth. chronic noncommunicable diseases can be considered communicable. the revised IHR of 2005 encourage a new paradigm of global public health intelligence. a network of Internet-based surveillance is considered to be one of the largest publicly available Internet-based reporting networks for emerging diseases in the world [240, 241] in global chronic disease surveillance, new global health surveillance networks have also emerged. examples include the world alliance for risk factor surveillance (WARFS) and the Americas' Network for chronic disease surveillance (AMNET) mental health and mental illness are also recognized as domains in public health surveillance [76]. new frontiers mean new challenges and solutions. mental illnesses account for more collective disability burden in developed countries than any other group of illnesses. e-health is a relatively recent term for healthcare practice supported by e-health. e-health is a relatively recent term for healthcare practice supported by e-health. e-health is a relatively recent term for healthcare practice supported by e-health. new terms like \u201cinfodemiology\u201d and \u201cinfoveillance\u201d have been coined for the use of informatics methods to analyze queries from the Internet search engines to predict disease outbreaks [186]. a new approach was presented for detecting influenza-like illness using search engine query data. the use of telephone-based random-digit-dialling methods in public health surveys and surveillance is now at a crossroads [191]. rapid changes in telecommunication, declines in participation rates, increases in the required level of effort and associated costs are becoming key challenges for telephone surveys. standards need to be developed that are common to all datasets as well as unique to individual datasets. examples include minimum lists of demographic variables and ICD codes, standardized codes for demographic variables, a minimum set of statistical tests, and rules for minimum cell size suppression. methodological research areas to improve data collection in the 21st century have been suggested. a number of methods to improve information dissemination in the 21st century are methodology to alert health professionals and the general public about forthcoming health risks. a number of methodological research areas to improve information dissemination are methodology to alert health professionals and the general public about forthcoming health risks. public health surveillance is the cornerstone of public health practice [214], as surveillance is only one element in the package of evidence to influence healthy public policies. there are at least 5 tools/processes for decision makers on public health actions: meta-analysis, risk assessment, economic evaluation, public health surveillance, and expert panels/consensus conferences. public health surveillance systems must be strengthened by allocating resources for the effective use of health surveillance data and tools. a greater proportion of public health workforce will need to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively understand and use surveillance concepts and techniques. it takes only a few hours to transport or mobilize thousands of people and goods across the globe. it is possible to travel between most places in the world in less time than the incubation period for many infectious diseases. there is also a need for global surveillance for risk factors for chronic diseases, as risk factors are transferable. the world health organization has created a global network of national influenza centres in 83 countries [236], the \u201cFluNet\u201d [238] and \u201cDengueNet\u201d [239] as Internet sites dedicated to monitoring global influenza and dengue-related information. a network of Internet-based surveillance, initiated by the International Society of Infectious Diseases, is considered to be one of the largest publicly available Internet-based reporting networks. emerging infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza, have demonstrated that we remain vulnerable to health threats [249]"}
