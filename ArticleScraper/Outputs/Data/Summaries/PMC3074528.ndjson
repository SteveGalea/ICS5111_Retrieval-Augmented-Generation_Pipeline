{"summary": "the first porcine circovirus (PCV) was discovered in a pig kidney cell line (PK15 ATCC-CCL33) and was called porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1). experimental infections have shown that PCV-1 is non-pathogenic for pigs. pigs infected experimentally often developed sub-clinical infection. genogroups PCV-2a and PCV-2b had a motif, located between amino acids 86 to 91, strongly specific and conserved in their capsid proteins. the genogroup PCV-2b is composed of 233 amino acids and is about 30kDa [8]. 91 to 100% of identity in nucleic acids versus 98 to 100% for the Rep. it is the main antigenic determinant of PCV-2 and contains four linear B-cell epitopes. the last one between amino acids 230 and 234 led to this protein being used for vaccine development. of PCV-1 and PCV-2) were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (Lonza, Levallois-Perret, France) supplemented with 5% of fetal calf serum (FCS) and Penicillin and Streptomycin (Gibco, Life technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, France) the PCV-2a virus used in this study was isolated from a tissue homogenate constituted of pulmonary, lymph nodal and sple PCR program for both reactions was composed of a first denaturing step of 2 min at 94\u00b0C, then 30 amplification cycles with one denaturing step of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, an annealing step of 30 s at 56 and 54.5\u00b0C. both fragments were cloned separately in pCR4 vector with the TOPO TA kit (Invitrogen) and transformed in XL1 blue MRF' electro-competent cells the PCV-2b DNA clone was constructed from the tandem infectious DNA clone already constructed and characterized. a primer pair, PCV-2b forward and reverse primers, was designed to amplify by PCR a 1.5 PCV-2b DNA clone containing only one copy of the cap gene. the integrity of the 1.5 copies of the PCV-2a and PCV-2b genomes in each parental DNA clone was confirmed by sequencing. mutagenesis was performed in two steps because of the primer length. the first denaturing step was extended to 2 min at 95\u00b0C. annealing step of 50 s at 60\u00b0C and an elongation step of 6.5 min at 68\u00b0C. 4 L of the digested PCR product was transformed in XL-10 Gold chemically competent cells according to the manufacturer instructions. each mutant DNA clone was checked by sequencing the 1.5 copies of the insert. five-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) piglets were free from porcine circovirus type 1 and 2 (no DNA and no PCV-antibodies detected), virus of african swine fever and classical swine fever. the experiment was performed in accordance with EU and French regulations on animal experimentation. tracheobronchial, mesenteric, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were euthanized in the 5th week post-transfection. piglets were euthanized by anesthesia followed by exsanguination. macroscopic lesions, histopathology and immunohistochemistry were assessed. PCV-2 serology PCV-2 antibodies were detected in all collected sera using a PCV-2 capsid protein-based Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) as previously described. results were expressed as the mean OD ratio obtained between a control (well coated with GST protein) and sample (well coated with ORF2 of PCV-2 fused with the GST) the viral genome was amplified from viral DNA extracted from lymph nodes and sequenced. the virus was isolated from a tissue homogenate constituted of pulmonary, lymph nodal and splenic tissues collected from two pigs clinically affected with PMWS. a long fragment corresponding to almost all the PCV-2a was amplified by PCR. a second fragment corresponding to the rep gene of the PCV-2a genome was amplified by PCR with the PCV-2a short forward and reverse primers. both fragments were cloned separately in pCR4 vector with the TOPO TA kit (Invitrogen) and transformed in XL1 Blue MRF' electro-competent cells.

designed in the rep gene to amplify by PCR a 1.5 PCV-2b DNA clone containing only one copy of the cap gene. the PCR reaction was composed of a first denaturing step of 2 min at 94\u00b0C, then 30 amplification cycles with one denaturing step of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, an annealing step of 30 s at 56.3\u00b0C and the primers PCV-2b/(TNKRSV) forward and reverse and PCV-2b/motif 2a forward and reverse were used to mutate the genogroup motif in the PCV-2b DNA clone. all the mutagenesis reactions were carried out with the QuickChange II XL mutagenesis kit. infectivity of both parental and mutant clones was assessed by infecting fresh PK15 cells with transfection supernatants. each DNA suspension was diluted to 200 g/mL in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffer Saline (DPBS) piglets were free from porcine circovirus type 1 and 2 (no DNA and no PCV-antibodies detected), virus of swine fever and classical s the four other groups (groups 3, 4, 5 and 6) were composed of eight piglets each. each group received 400 g of DNA from the parental or mutant DNA clones by intramuscular (IM) route in both sides of the neck. piglets were immunostimulated at 3 days post transfection (dpt) with 1.8 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma Aldrich) and at 8 dpt with 0.9 mg of KLH (Sigma microscopic lesions were assessed on haemalun-eosin-safranin stained tissue section. the microlesions were assessed by a person not aware of the treatment received by the piglets, in lymphoid organs and in the lungs. each score scored from absence (0) to severe (3). the viral titers of the tonsils, tracheobronchial and inguinal lymph nodes were determined by 10-fold serial dilutions according to Kaerber's method. the viral genome was amplified from viral DNA extracted from lymph nodes and sequenced. the viral genome was amplified from viral DNA extracted from lymph nodes and sequenced. the cells infected with supernatants showed PCV-2 antigens in their nucleus. supernatants recovered from PK15 cells transfected with the mutant clones allowed the infection of fresh PK15 cells. both parental and capsid mutant clones were infectious in vitro and able to produce viral infectious particles. the macrolesions of the tracheobronchial (TB) lymph nodes were significantly more severe in the PCV-2a group 3 (mean of 1.375) and the PCV-2b group 4 (mean of 1.5) than in the control groups and in the PCV-2a/motif 2b group (0.875 in average) in the PCV-2a/motif 2a, the TB lymph nodes were more enlarged (mean of 0.875) than those in the control groups and immunostimulation 6/8 0.875 a, b 1.34 b Macrolesions in TB lymph nodes were scored as follows: 0 for no lesions, 1 for mild hypertrophy, 2 for moderate hypertrophy and congestion. microscopic lesions in lymphoid organs (lymphocyte depletion in TB and inguinal lymph nodes) and in lungs (interstitial pneumonia) were scored. the presence of viral antigens was assessed by IHC in the organs of all animals. most of the pigs that received the two parental clones and the second mutant, PCV-2b/motif 2a, were positive by IHC. genemic viral load in sera Detection of viral genomes in the control groups 1 and 2 remained negative throughout the trial. virus genomes were detected first in the group 4 (PCV-2b) at 14 dpt in all piglets, with an average of 106.8 genome copies/mL of serum in group 3 and of 106 copies/mL in group 6 (Figure 2A and 2D) no genomic viral load was detected in any piglet inoculated with the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant. results were expressed in log10 of viral genome copies per mL of serum. piglets that received PCV-2b DNA had viral genomes in their organs. the highest titer was found in the PCV-2b group with 104.6 TCID50/g of tissue. however, the difference with the mean of infectious titers was not significant. the lowest viral load was determined in the organs of PCV-2a/motif 2b inoculated piglets with an average of 102.74 TCID50/g of tissue. the capsid protein was detected with an anti-PCV-2b serum. the protein was detected with an anti-PCV-2b serum. both parental and mutant clones were infectious. in the PCV-2b/motif 2a, the TB lymph nodes were more enlarged (mean of 0.875) than those in the control groups and in the PCV-2a/motif 2b group. in the PCV-2a/motif 2a, the TB lymph nodes were more enlarged (mean of 0.875) than those in the control groups. immunostimulation caused histopathological lesions such as moderate interstitial pneumonia and presence of abundant eosinophils in lymphoid organs in two immunostimulated pigs. microlesions in this group (score mean of 0.625) were significantly weaker than those in the four transfected groups. seroconversion No seroconversion was detected in the two control groups during the trial. the first seroconversion was detected at 21 dpt in the groups inoculated with the PCV-2a parental clones (5/8 positive piglets in the PCV-2a group 3 and 6/7 in the PCV-2b group 4) genomes were detected first in the group 4 (PCV-2b) at 14 dpt in all piglets. the load remains constant until the end of the trial. in the group 3 (PCV-2a) and group 6 (PCV-2b/motif 2a), genomic viral loads were detected in all piglets at 14 dpt. results were expressed in log10 of viral genome copies per mL of serum. each point representing the genomic load in the serum of one piglet. Neither genomic viral load nor infectious particles were found in the tissue of the two control groups. the lowest viral load was determined in the organs of PCV-2a/motif 2b inoculated piglets with an average of 102.74 TCID50/g of tissue. the lowest viral load was determined in the organs of PCV-2a/motif 2b inoculated piglets with an average of 102.74 TCID50/g of tissue. Sequencing results No reversion in the cap gene was detected on the two fragments amplified from emulsified in ICFA was used to trigger clinical signs. pigs transfected with both parental clones developed sub-clinical infections. in vivo, pigs transfected with both parental clones developed sub-clinical infections. the two parental clones PCV-2a and PCV-2b showed differences in experimental conditions similar to the infectious virus. in contrast, the virus failed to induce PMWS in piglets, while it was recovered from a diseased piglet. the difference in virulence could be observed between isolates of the same PCV-2a genogroup. differences in amino acids between the two parental strains and the two mutants are indicated in bold and underlined. in vivo characterization of the two mutants was carried out to determine if the genogroup motif was involved in the virulence mechanism of PCV-2. the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant clone had a virulence attenuated compared to its parent, the PCV-2a clone. piglets were euthanized after 35 dpt, later than the last detection of plasmids in the previous experiment. the genomes detected in organs were viral DNA and not input plasmid DNA. in some Geminiviruses, the absence or inactivation of the Cap protein led to reduced accumulation of single-stranded DNA associated with an increase in the level of double-stranded DNA replicative forms. the interaction of its Cap and Rep proteins inhibited the nicking and closing function of the Rep and not the Rep ATPase activity. PCV-2a backbone (PCV-2a/motif 2b group) led to a decrease of genome copies in organs compared to the PCV-2a but also to a decrease of the produced infectious particles. the genogroup motif could be involved in the replication regulation but not solely. AK took care of the animals in the facilities and participated in the in vivo trial. RC participated in the design of the study and its coordination."}
