{"summary": "PEDV is a major cause of aqueous diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration in pigs. it is transmitted via direct or indirect fecal-oral routes. it is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a small 28 kb genome. in china, the first occurrence of PED was in 1973, although the causative agent was not identified until 1984. clinical signs of PED are seen in pig herds within 7 days of birth and present as vomiting and aqueous diarrhea. death rates during this stage range from 80% to 100% resulting in huge economic losses in the pig industry. fecal samples were placed in phosphate buffer saline supplemented with penicillin G (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (2 mg/mL) and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min. RNA extraction and reverse transcription were carried out as previously described. PCR products were purified by using an AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit. line supplemented with penicillin G (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (2 mg/mL) centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min. RNA extraction and reverse transcription were carried out as previously described. PCR products were purified by using an AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit. the S genes of CH-TPC-03-2013, CH-SHC-12-2013, CH-HGCP-12-2013, and CH-CCC-05-2013 comprised of 4176 nt. compared to the S gene of CV777, sequencing of the field strains revealed a range of lengths: one was three nt shorter (4149 nt), nine were the same length (4152 nt), four were six nt longer (4158 nt), 39 nt the deduced amino acid sequences of the 55 S proteins ranged from 1382 to 1391 aa in length. the SS2 epitope was conserved in all 55 Chinese PEDV strains. most strains exhibited two or three amino acid mutations in the SS6 epitope. ten of the fifty-five South China PEDV strains belonged to G1b. the third group (G2a) was made up of three Korean strains. the last group (G2b) included 12 Chinese strains. some vaccine strains including CV777, attenuated DR13, SM98, and 83P-5_100th-passaged are used in a variety of countries. the S genes of our 55 recently isolated Chinese field strains shared identity with CV777 (93.8%\u201395.7%), CHGD-01 (94.6.0%\u201398.3%), SM98 (93.3%\u201395.4%), and 83P-5_100th-passaged (93.7%\u201396.0%). TC1-02-2013, and CH-STC-12-2011, lost the high-specificity N-glycosylation sites of 68 strains in comparison to CV777. one additional N-glycosylation site was not occur in the CV777 strain, presented in CHGD-01, KNU-0801, KNU-0905, and all of the Chinese field isolates. the S genes of the 55 Chinese PEDV strains ranged from 4149 to 4176 nucleotides in length. the S gene of strain CH-WTC1-02-2013 comprised 4149 nt, which is the same length as that of the Korean strain DR13. compared to the S gene of CV777, sequencing of the field strains revealed a range of lengths. one was three nt shorter (4149 nt), nine were the same length (4152 nt), four were six nt longer (4158 nt) and two were 24 nt longer (4,176 nt). the deduced amino acid sequences of the 55 S proteins ranged from 1382 to 1391 aa. the second group (G1b) consisted of CH2, CH5, CH6, CH7, JS-2004-2, LJB-03, DX from China, one USA strain (USA/OH851/2014), and strains recently isolated in Europe. the third group (G2a) was made up of three Korean strains (CNU-091222-01, KNU-0905, and Chinju99) and two Japanese strains (NK and KH) sequence identity analysis of the S gene Sequence alignment showed nucleotide (deduced amino acid) identities in the range 94.4% to 99.9% (93.8%\u201399.9%) among the 55 Chinese PEDV strains and identities in the range 92.4% to 99.76% (90.7%\u201399.5%) with the foreign reference strains reported in GenBank. asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr-127NKTL high-specificity N-glycosylation sites are conserved in vaccine strains (including CV777) 52 strains had similar N-glycosylation conformations within the sequence set. these predictions were done on the Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons. we sequenced and analyzed the S glycoprotein gene of 55 Chinese strains. all 55 Chinese PEDV strains had a high sequence similarity with previous Guangdong strains. one field strain was shorter than those of classical strains due to nucleotide deletions. the remaining 53 strains contained several amino acid substitutions. this resulted in changes in the amino acid constitution of the SS6, 2C10, and COE neutralizing epitopes. the PEDVs circulating between 2011 and 2015 in this region have evolved from historic strains within the local region. the results of our analyses will be useful when improving the PED control strategies in this region."}
