PUFAs and their metabolites were analyzed by ESI-MS (n = 5\u20139). HEPE, hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid; HETE, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HDHA, hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid. to this end, we focused on inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Pla2g12a (XIIA), Pla2g2d (IID) and Pla2g2e (IIE) were detected only at trace levels. immunohistochemistry of the colon showed that sPLA2-X protein was localized in IECs and goblet cells. we applied the DSS-induced colitis model to mice lacking individual sPLA2s expressed in the colon. Pla2g10/ mice showed more severe body weight loss (Fig. 5A), fecal bleeding plus diarrhea (summarized as the clinical score) than did WT mice. expression levels of genes related to pro-inflammatory and Th17-related cytokines increased more robustly in Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice after DSS challenge. expression of both M1 and M2 macrophage markers was also greater in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. colorectal expression of various cytokines, chemokines, macrophage markers, and other inflammatory genes was elevated in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice relative to Pla2g10+/+ mice. expression of the pro-inflammatory and anti-bacterial genes S100a8 and S100a9 was higher in Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. expression of several epithelial markers was lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ Chemokines and their receptors Ccl4 NM_013652 1.24 4.07 Ccl7 NM_013654 0.60 2.25 Ccr6 NM_009835 1.35 2.44 Cxcl13 NM_018866 1.21 5.49 Cxcl2 NM_009140 0.93 4.60 Macrophages Emr1 NM_010130 0.76 2.24 Nos2 NM_010927 0.76 2.72 Cd68 in the blood (Fig. 6, D and E) and even more profoundly in the spleen (Fig. 6, F and G) of DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice relative to replicate Pla2g10+/+ mice. these results suggest that the transition from immature to mature erythrocytes is disturbed by Pla2g10 deficiency. weight loss (Fig. 7B) and increased clinical score (Fig. 7C) were obvious in Pla2g10/ mice that received Pla2g10+/+ BM cells (WT KO) in comparison with WT KO chimeras. weight loss (Fig. 7B) and increased clinical score (Fig. 7C) were similar to those in WT KO chimeras. spleen weight (D) and hematocrit (E) in indicated groups after oral administration of DSS for 7 days (n = 5\u20136, *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01). lipids extracted from colon tissues of Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice with or without DSS treatment were subject to ESI-MS. AA also showed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance. ESI-MS analysis of PUFAs (A), AA metabolites (B) and EPA/DHA metabolites (C) in the colon of Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice with or without administration of 1% DSS for 7 days. results are expressed as percentages, with values in the absence of lipids or GSK137647 as 100% (dashed line) PUFAs can act on the fatty acid receptor GPR120 or GPR40 (51) we tested the effect of GSK137647, a GPR120-selective agonist, on cytokine production by LPLs. the release of IL-17A and IL-22 was suppressed by GSK137647 as efficiently as DHA. we applied the DSS-induced colitis model to mice null for Pla2g4a and Pla2g6, which are expressed in the colon. on day 7, colorectal damage with epithelial loss and massive immune cell infiltration were far more prominent in Pla2g4a/ mice than in WT mice. hematocrit (E), and ES-MS profiles of colorectal lipids (F) were evaluated at day 7. mean S.E., *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. cPLA2 is preferentially coupled with PGE2 and to a lesser extent 12-HHT. cPLA2 and sPLA2-X exert a protective effect against colitis by mobilizing distinct sets of lipid metabolites. phospholipid metabolism underlying the action of sPLA2-X in this context remains to be determined. release of EPA was very low, because EPA-bearing PC was a minor phospholipid component in mouse sperm. sPLA2-X secreted from activated spermatozoa preferentially cleaves DHA- or DPA-containing PC. sPLA2-X mobilizes DHA, DPA, and LPC from the sperm membrane. lipid products released from the sperm membrane by sPLA2-X, particularly DPA, facilitate optimal fertilization. PLA2G10tg/+ mice had fewer circulating lymphocytes than did wild-type (WT) mice. the weight of the spleen relative to that of the heart was significantly lower. 1 and IgG2a were higher in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. circulating leukocyte counts in 8-week-old male WT and PLA2G10tg/+ (X-Tg) mice. microarray gene profiling revealed lower expression of genes crucial for differentiation, proliferation, survival, and migration of thymocytes (e.g. Cd8a, Ccr9, Rorc, Klf2, and Ets2) (33\u201337) in PLA2G10tg/+ mice versus WT mice Total RNAs were isolated from the thymus of PLA2G10tg/+ and littermate WT mice at 6 months.

BM cells from Pla2g10+/+ or Pla2g10/ mice were adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated Pla2g10+/+ or Pla2g10/ mice. weight loss (Fig. 7B sPLA2-X in non-hematopoietic cells, most likely IECs, is mainly responsible for the protection from colitis. DSS-induced splenomegaly (Fig. 7D) and the decrease in hematocrit (Fig. 7E) were significantly more severe in KO chimeras than in WT chimeras. colon tissues of Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice were subject to ESI-MS. EPA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; C22:5) were increased in WT mice. AA also showed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance. effects of PUFAs and their metabolites (D) or GSK137647 (GSK; a GPR120 agonist) (E) on Th17 cytokine production by LPLs isolated from DSS-treated WT mice. results expressed as percentages, with values in the absence of lipids or GSK137647 as 100% (dashed line) PUFAs may act, at least in part, on GPR120 on LPLs. daily intrarectal injection of 3 PUFAs into Pla2g10/ mice prevented colitis. results further support notion that sPLA2-X prevents colitis by releasing 3 PUFAs. the overall phenotypes in Pla2g4a/ mice were similar to those in Ptger4/ mice, which lack the PGE2 receptor EP4 (31), or Ptges/ mice, which lack microsomal PGE2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) (Fig. 9, A\u2013E) (52), even though the overall symptoms were milder in Ptges/ mice. cPLA2 is preferentially coupled with PGE2 and to a lesser extent 12-HHT in DSS-induced colitis compared with WT mice. the levels of EPA and DHA metabolites were unaffected by Pla2g4a deficiency. sPLA2-X is abundantly expressed in the testis, being stored in and released from the acrosomes of spermatozoa during capacitation. Pla2g10/ spermatozoa display reduced fertility, with no alteration in motility (40, 54) however, the phospholipid metabolism underlying the action of sPLA2-X in this context remains to be determined. spermatozoa preferentially cleaves DHA- or DPA-containing PC. sPLA2-X mobilizes DPA, DHA, and LPC from the sperm membrane. B and C, ESI-MS of PUFAs (B and LPC species) released from Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ spermatozoa after capacitation (n = 4\u20136) the weight of the spleen relative to that of the heart was significantly lower. the number of spleenocytes was 50% lower in PLA2G10tg/+ mice. the proportion of CD45R+ B cells was lower in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. circulating leukocyte counts in 8-week-old male WT and PLA2G10tg/+ (X-Tg) mice (n = 4) total counts of splenocytes in WT and X-Tg mice (n = 3) D, total counts of splenocytes in WT and X-Tg mice (n = 3) RNAs were isolated from the thymus of PLA2G10tg/+ and littermate WT mice at 6 months. equal amounts of total RNA (pooled from four mice for each genotype) were subject to two-color gene expression microarray analysis. transcript variant 1 Nup35 NM_027091 0.671 Nucleoporin 35 Tdrd5 XM_129603 0.673 Tudor domain containing 5 Phf23 NM_030064 0.674 PHD finger protein 23 Bysl NM_016859 0.679 Bystin-like Jmjd3 NM_001017426 0.686 Jumonji domain containing 3 Klf3 NM_008453 0.690 peritoneal cavity was lower in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. m-CSF-driven BM-derived macrophages showed greater expression of the M2 marker Arg1 than did WT mice, even when they were cultured with M1 polarizers (LPS + IFN-) splenic levels of AA, EPA, and DHA were significantly greater in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. the levels of AA metabolites tended to be slightly higher in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. a previously unappreciated capacity of sPLA2-X to mobilize 3 PUFAs and their metabolites in vivo. these results suggest a previously unappreciated capacity of sPLA2-X to mobilize 3 PUFAs and their metabolites in vivo. features of immunological disorders include impaired mucosal barrier function, pronounced innate and acquired immunity, and dysregulated production of cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. both 6 AA metabolites, such as PGE2 and 12(S)-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT) (31, 45, 46), and 3 PUFAs or their metabolites, such as resolvins D and E (47\u201349), are the expression of Pla2g4a and Pla2g5 was constant regardless of DSS challenge. the expression of sPLA2s was constant regardless of DSS challenge. Pla2g2d/, Pla2g2e/, Pla2g2f/, Pla2g3/, and Pla2g5/ mice showed no obvious phenotypes in this model. RT-PCR of the colon revealed expression levels of genes related to pro-inflammatory and Th17-related cytokines. expression of Reg3g encodes an IL-22-inducible anti-bacterial protein (42, 43) also tended to be higher in DSS-treated Pla2g10/. expression of both M1 and M2 macrophage markers was also greater in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. expression of several epithelial markers was lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. equal amounts of total RNA (pooled from three mice for each genotype) were subjected to one-color gene expression microarray analysis. fold changes (KO relative to WT) on the microarray are listed. flow cytometry of cells in the erythrocyte lineage showed more profound splenomegaly (Fig. 6, A and B) and a decrease in hematocrit (Fig. 6C) relative to Pla2g10+/+ mice, suggesting alternation of extramedullary erythropoiesis due to colorectal bleeding. spleen (F and G) of Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice with or without administration of DSS for 7 days. BM cells from Pla2g10+/+ or Pla2g10/ mice were adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated Pla2g10+/+ or Pla2g10/ mice. weight loss (Fig. 7B) and increased clinical score (Fig. 7C) were obvious in Pla2g10/ mice that received induced splenomegaly and decrease in hematocrit were significantly more severe in KO KO chimeras than in WT KO chimeras. spleen weight (D) and hematocrit (E) were significantly more severe in KO KO chimeras than in WT KO chimeras, implying an additional contribution of hematopoietic sPLA2-X to these processes in the absence of non-hema colorectal levels of AA metabolites were not affected by Pla2g10 deficiency. those of EPA or DHA metabolites, such as resolvins and 18-HEPE, were substantially lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. these results raise the possibility that the mobilization of 3 PUFAs or their metabolites may underlie the anti-inflammatory role of sPLA2-X in colitis effects of intrarectal injection of 3 PUFAs on body weight loss of Pla2g10/ mice treated with 1% DSS for 5 days (n = 3) results are expressed as percentages, with the value of DSS-untreated mice as 100% (dashed line). colorectal level of AA tended to be lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice. 3 PUFA metabolites were present at 30 times lower than the AA metabolites. AA suppressed IL-17A release by LPLs. sPLA2-X may also contribute to the protection from colitis. mice lack microsomal PGE2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) (52), even though the overall symptoms were milder in Ptges/ mice. WT (n = 9), Pla2g4a/ (n = 4), Pla2g6/ (n = 5), and Ptges/ (n = 10) mice were administered 1% DSS orally. the severe exacerbation of DSS-induced colitis in Pla2g4a/ mice is due to the reduction of colon-protective prostanoids such as PGE2 and 12-HHT. cPLA2-mPGES-1 axis accounts mostly, if not entirely, for a pool of PGE2 responsible for this disease model. sPLA2-X secreted from activated spermatozoa preferentially cleaves DHA- or DPA-containing PC in the sperm membrane to release DHA, DPA, and LPC. sPLA2-X secreted from activated spermatozoa preferentially cleaves DHA- or DPA-containing PC in the sperm membrane. lipid products released from sperm membrane by sPLA2-X facilitate optimal fertilization. lipid products released from sperm membrane by sPLA2-X, particularly DPA, facilitate optimal fertilization. proportions of splenic CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages were lower in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. median fluorescence intensity of CD45R on B cells was greater in PLA2G10tg/+ mice than in WT mice. in the thymus, PLA2G10tg/+ mice had less CD4+CD8+ double-positive cells than did WT mice. in the thymus, PLA2G10tg/+ mice had more CD4CD8+ double-negative cells than did WT mice. gene name Accession no.

ESI-MS profiling of PUFA metabolites in PLA2G10tg/+ mice. PUFAs were extracted from spleen (A), skin (B), and colon (C) mice. PUFAs and their metabolites were analyzed by ESI-MS. Pla2g10 (X) was expressed most abundantly in C57BL/6 colon. Pla2g5 (V), Pla2g2f (IIF), Pla2g3 (III) and Pla2g12a (XIIA) were detected only at trace levels. sPLA2-X protein was localized in IECs and goblet cells. b, quantitative RT-PCR of various sPLA2s in WT colon with or without administration of 3% DSS for 7 days (n = 3). b, immunohistochemistry of sPLA2-X in WT colon. Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice were administered 1% DSS orally. expression levels of genes related to pro-inflammatory and Th17-related cytokines were increased more robustly in Pla2g10/ mice. expression of Reg3g, which encodes an IL-22-inducible anti-bacterial protein, also tended to be higher in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice. expression of both M1 and M2 macrophage markers was also greater in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. expression of several epithelial markers was lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice. expression of several epithelial markers was lower in DSS-treated Pla2g10/ mice than in Pla2g10+/+ mice.

ESI-MS analysis of PUFAs (A), AA metabolites (B) and EPA/DHA metabolites (C) in the colon of Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10/ mice with or without administration of 1% DSS for 7 days. results are expressed as percentages, with values in the absence of lipids or GSK137647 as 100% (dashed line) 3 PUFAs (EPA, DPA and DHA) were incubated with PUFAs ex vivo. production of Th17 cytokines, IL-17A and IL-22 was partially suppressed by 3 PUFAs. sPLA2-X prevents colitis by releasing 3 PUFAs. cPLA2-PGE2 Axis is linked to AA metabolism in colitis. we applied the DSS-induced colitis model to mice null for Pla2g4a and Pla2g6, which are expressed in the colon. colorectal damage with epithelial loss, splenomegaly, and decrease of hematocrit were far more prominent in Pla2g4a/ mice than in WT mice. colon histology (bar, 100 m) (C), spleen weight (D), hematocrit (E) and ES-MS profiles of colorectal lipids were evaluated at day 7. cPLA2 is preferentially coupled with PGE2 and to a lesser extent 12-HHT in DSS-induced colitis. cPLA2-mPGES-1 axis accounts mostly, if not entirely, for a pool of PGE2 responsible for this disease model. cPLA2 and sPLA2-X exert a protective effect against colitis by mobilizing distinct sets of lipid metabolites, i.e. 6 AA and 3 PUFA metabolites. the levels of PC species with DHA or DPA were significantly lower in Pla2g10+/+ cells than in Pla2g10/ cells. release of EPA was very low, because EPA-bearing PC was a minor phospholipid component in mouse sperm. sPLA2-X secreted from activated spermatozoa preferentially cleaves DHA- or DPA-containing PC in the sperm membrane. lipid products released from sperm membrane by sPLA2-X facilitate optimal fertilization. lipid products released from sperm membrane by sPLA2-X, particularly DPA, facilitate optimal fertilization. sPLA2-X is a pro-inflammatory enzyme. sPLA2-X mobilizes 3 PUFAs in addition to 6 AA in these tissues. sPLA2-IID is highly expressed in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues. sPLA2-X has the intrinsic ability to mobilize 3 PUFA-derived metabolites in vivo. 3 PUFA metabolites promote M2 macrophage polarization (58, 59), prevent T cell activation or differentiation (60, 61), and alter antibody production by B cells (62) our results are also in accord with the aggravating role of sPLA2-X in asthma (2), where M2 macrophages are associated with the Th2-skewed airway inflammation (13). cPLA2 and sPLA2-X are functionally segregated in the large intestine. this is the first demonstration of the PLA2 enzymes responsible for the release of distinct PUFAs in IBD. sPLA2-X-driven 3 PUFAs are capable of suppressing Th17 cytokine production by intestinal LPLs through GPR120. sPLA2-IID mobilizes DHA-derived RvD1 in draining lymph nodes to suppress contact dermatitis (5) and AA-derived PGD2 in the lung to counteract anti-viral immunity (66). sPLA2-V in adipose tissue releases oleic acid from lipoproteins in the process of obesity (8). sPLA2-X selectively hydrolyzes DPA/DHA-containing PC species in sperm membranes to release DPA, DHA, and LPC. sPLA2-X promotes epididymal sperm maturation, allowing enrichment of DPA/DHA-containing PC species in sperm membranes. sPLA2-X acts on these phospholipids to release DPA for successful fertilization."}
