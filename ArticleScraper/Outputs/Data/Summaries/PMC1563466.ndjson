{"summary": "caveolae are involved in diverse cellular functions such as signal transduction, cholesterol homeostasis, endo- and transcytosis. their occurrence in epithelium of the airways may be expected but has not yet been examined. cav-1-immunoreactivity and caveolae were absent in cav-1-deficient mice. caveolae are integral membrane components in basal and ciliated epithelial cells. caveolae are omega-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane measuring 50 to 100 nm in diameter. a role of these proteins for the development cycle of Chlamydiae is discussed. the human coronavirus 229E is known to induce respiratory tract infections. the presence of caveolins, their interaction, and the presence of caveolae in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells have not yet been determined. a selective association of cav-2 but not cav-1 was described with Chlamydia pneumoniae. it is likely that both proteins can have divergent functions during infectious processes. we therefore examined the expression of caveolae and caveolins in bronchial and tracheal epithelium. RT-PCR was performed by adding 1 l cDNA, 0.5 l of each gene-specific intron-spanning primer pair for cav-1 or cav-2 (20 pM; MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany, Table 1. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% TRIS-acetate-EDTA agarose gel. real-time RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from abraded tracheal epithelial cells of rats (n = 6, SPF; n = 3, standard conditions). the PCR conditions included initial denaturation in one cycle of 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 59\u00b0C, and 20 s at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% TRIS-acetate-EDTA agarose gel. laser-assisted microdissection and subsequent RT-PCR laser-assisted microdissection were used to isolate epithelial cells from cryosections of tracheae of rats. RNA was reverse-transcribed for 75 min at 43\u00b0C, followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase by heating the RNA samples for 5 min at 99\u00b0C. for subsequent PCR, 4 l cDNA, 2.5 l 10 PCR buffer II, 2 l MgCl2 (15 mM), 0.5 l dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 l of each primer (20 pM; primer sets spanning the region 25\u2013147 for ca secondary antibodies used in this study for immunohistochemistry were: FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-lg, F(ab')2 fragments (1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-Ig, F(ab')2 fragments (1:50; Dianova), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-Ig (1:1,000; Dianova). secondary antibodies used electron microscopy For conventional electron microscopy, tracheae of Wistar rats (normal conditions, n = 2), cav-1 deficient mice (SPF, n = 2), and C57/Bl6 mice (SPF, n = 3) were prepared as follows. the vascular system was flushed via the ascending aorta with a rinsing solution containing heparin. cav-1-deficient mice (SPF, n = 2), wild-type mice (SPF, n = 2), and 10% neutral formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human bronchi (n = 4) were used for immunohistochemical analysis. slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-Ig. sections from human bronchi (6 m) were deparaffinated and incubated with anti-cav-1 and anti-cav-2 antibody. the specificity of the anti-cav-1 antibody was validated by incubation of cryosections from cav-1 deficient mice. further controls included omission of primary antibodies. the nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm the protein transfer from the gels to the membrane. the membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-cav-1, -1 and -2 antibodies, diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. anti-cav-1 from rabbit labeled with Cy5-conjugated secondary reagent. anti-cav-2 antibody labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary reagent. both primary antibodies were applied simultaneously. RT-PCR Total RNA from abraded tracheal epithelial cells of adult Wistar rats was isolated by using the RNeasy method. the epithelial cells from the trachea were abraded using cotton swabs that were carefully rolled over the epithelial layer. l MgCl2 (15 mM), 0.5 l dNTP (10 mM each), 0.1 l AmpliTaqGold polymerase (5 U/l; all reagents from Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and 17.9 l H2O. cycling conditions were 12 min at 95\u00b0C,40 cycles with 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 59\u00b0C,30 s at 72\u00b0C, and a real-time RT-PCR was performed in an I-Cycler (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) using a QuantiTec SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) the PCR conditions included initial denaturation in one cycle of 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 59\u00b0C, and 20 s at 72\u00b0C. RNA was reverse-transcribed for 75 min at 43\u00b0C, followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase by heating the RNA samples for 5 min at 99\u00b0C. for subsequent PCR, 4 l cDNA, 2.5 l 10 PCR buffer II, 2 l MgCl2 (15 mM), 0.5 l dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 l of each primer (20 pM; primer sets spanning the region 25\u2013147 for ca 0.2 l AmpliTag Gold polymerase (5 U/l, all reagents from Applied Biosystems) and 14.8 l H2O were applied. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% TRIS-acetate-EDTA agarose gel. secondary antibodies used in this study for immunohistochemistry were: FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-lg, F(ab')2 fragments (1:200; Dianova), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-Ig, F(ab')2 fragments (1:50; Dianova), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-Ig (1:1,000; Dianova). dehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were dissected, stored for 5 h in the same fixative. washed in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl buffer, osmicated for 1 h in aqueous 1% OsO4. sections of 80 nm thickness were cut on an ultramicrotome. primary antibodies were diluted in 0.005 M phosphate buffer containing 0.01 % NaN3 and 4.48 g/l NaCl. these antibodies were applied singly or in combination for double-labeling immunofluorescence. slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-Ig. tracheal epithelial cells of Wistar rats (n = 5), hearts and lungs from cav-1-deficient mice and from wild-type mice (each n = 2) were homogenized by a mixer mill (MM 300, Qiagen) with lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mM octylglucoside (Sigma the membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-cav-1, -1 and -2, primary antibodies, diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS. the secondary antibodies were diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. a region of interest was photobleached 10 times at 100% activity using the 633 nm laser and maximum zoom to destroy the acceptor fluorophore (Cy5). the change in Cy3 signal (IF) was determined in the photobleached area where IF = DDA \u2013 DDB, and DDB is the fluorescence intensity of the donor before photobleaching of the acceptor. thelium (TE) and in microdissected (picked) tracheal epithelial cells (TEC) with primer sets spanning 25\u2013147 bp and 392\u2013497 bp within the coding region. control reactions for each primer pair included the absence of template (H20), absence of reverse transcriptase (RT), and analysis of samples of dried O.C.T. compound. a band of 22 kD and a band of 18 kD, corresponding to cav-1, were detected in abraded tracheal epithelial cells using an anti-cav-1 antibody. bands of the same molecular weight were detected in lung and heart homogenates. corresponding to the three known cav-2-isoforms, were detected with monoclonal anti-cav-2 antibody in abraded TE. no cav-1 was detected in lung homogenates of cav-1-deficient mice. the 50 kD bands in all lanes were due to the secondary antibodies that detected the heavy chain of mouse IgG. epithelial cells (arrows) as well as cells of the lamina propria and smooth muscle cells were immunoreactive for cav-2. no immunoreactivity was detected in the bronchiolar epithelium. labeling with anti-cav-1 antibody was stronger in endothelium. epithelium = e Cav-2-immunoreactivity was found in the same cell types as cav-1-immunoreactivity. the cav-2-immunolabeling of the epithelium was stronger than smooth muscle cells. as for cav-1, no labeling for cav-2 was observed in the epithelial cells. secretory cells were labeled with anti-SP-D antibody (green, arrowheads) the cav-1-immunoreactivity was localized at the cell membrane and SP-D-immunoreactivity was localized in the cytoplasm. caveolae were found in the basal (A and B, arrows) and in the lateral membrane (C, arrowheads) of ciliated cells in the rat trachea. caveolae were present only in the basal cells of the mouse trachea. we measured IF in the region of the basolateral plasma membrane. IF measured in this region was higher (IF = 4.795) than that in the whole bleached area. the difference between IF observed in the experimental group as compared to the corresponding controls was highly significant. RT-PCR analysis of total mRNA isolated from rat lungs revealed expression of cav-1 and cav-2. no bands were observed in control reactions that included absence of DNA template or the reverse transcriptase. in 17/18 samples of microdissected tracheal epithelial cells collected from 5 rats (SPF) no mRNA for cav-1 and cav-2 was detected in areas next to positive tissue that contained O.C.T. compound only, but no cells. mRNA signal detected in epithelium was not caused by contamination originating from caveolin-containing adjacent cells. a single 22 kD protein was detected in abraded rat tracheal epithelium (TE) with monoclonal affinity-purified anti-cav-1 antibody. 22 kD () and 18 kD () cav-1 protein isoforms were detected in abraded TE with monoclonal affinity-purified anti-cav-1 antibody. endothelial cells and type I epithelial cells were immunoreactive for cav-1. labeling of endothelial cells of capillaries (c) in the lamina propria was stronger compared to the epithelium. cav-1- and cav-1-immunoreactivity (B) were co-localized in the basal cells. some cells exhibited cav-1- but not cav-1-immunoreactivity (arrowheads) most secretory cells that were labeled with anti-SP-D were not cav-1-immunoreactive. most of the secretory cells that were labeled with anti-SP-D [20] were not cav-1-immunoreactive. cav-1 labeling was localized at the basolateral membrane and in the apical area of the ciliated cells underneath the luminal plasma membrane. the specificity of the cav-1-immunostaining was confirmed by the absence of cav-1-immunolabeling in cav-1-deficient mice. cav-1 and cav-2 are in close apposition in airway epithelial cells in situ. a false-positive FRET signal that can be caused by cross-reactivity of secondary antibodies was excluded by applying both secondary antibodies to sections incubated with anti-cav-1 antibody only. v-1 was bleached in a region of interest 1 (compare ROI 1 in C and D) ROI 8: freehand encircled region of the basolateral plasma membrane of the epithelial cells in bleached area. adenoviruses require damage of the integrity of the epithelia or of the tight junctions to get access to the basolateral membrane of the ciliated cells to be infectious. adenoviruses require damage of the integrity of the epithelia or of the tight junctions to get access to the basolateral membrane of the ciliated cells to be infectious. adenovirus2 is localized basolaterally in ciliated cells and in basal cells. cav-1-immunoreactivity was stronger in endothelial cells compared to epithelial cells. cav-1-labeling was stronger in the epithelium than in the endothelium. cav-1-labeling was stronger in the epithelium but not in lung and heart homogenates. caveolae containing the -isoform may be involved in this process. it is tempting to speculate that certain caveolae may exist that contain predominantly the -isoform. caveolae may be involved in other signaling cascades. authors' contributions PK and PK conceived and designed the study.
