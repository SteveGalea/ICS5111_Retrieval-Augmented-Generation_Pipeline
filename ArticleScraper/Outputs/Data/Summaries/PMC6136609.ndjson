{"summary": "melioidosis is an infectious disease that can infect humans or animals. it is caused by the bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei. human cases are mainly reported in hyperendemic areas of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus, renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung disease, or immunosuppressive therapy. clinical presentations vary widely, and include skin and soft tissue abscesses, pneumonia, and disseminated infection with septic shock, the latter having mortality rates above 80%. the first isolation of B. pseudomallei occurred in Antananarivo in 1932 when a case of animal melioidosis, also related to the french outbreak, occurred in 1979 in a horse that had recently been imported from France into R\u00e9union Island. between 2004 and 2017, there were six human cases of melioidosis that were detected and probably acquired in the city of Mahajanga (Madagascar), of which three were diagnosed and treated in R\u00e9union Island in 2004 and 2006. the first human case of melioidosis in the region was detected in may 2004 in a 60-year-old frenchman living in a city on the northwestern coast of Madagascar. he was admitted to an intensive care unit for management of respiratory distress and septic shock. about 20 or 30 years before the onset of the disease, he had lived in Vietnam, where melioidosis is endemic. retired manager, B. pseudomallei, was treated for ten days with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin after a chest X-ray showed a patchy infiltrate of the right upper and middle lobes. after clinical improvement, the patient was discharged, but five days later became feverish again. he was referred to a hospital in R\u00e9union Island for further management. the fifth case in Madagascar was a 44-year-old frenchman admitted with acute anuria and fever to the emergency service of a Belgian hospital near the french border in march 2013. he had a severe inflammatory syndrome, spondylodiscitis at L1, lung infiltrates, pyelonephritis, and a prostatic abscess. the patient was discharged for few days until the real causative agent was identified. a total body-computed tomography scan showed multiple bilateral lung abscesses, a liver abscess, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. despite immediate antimicrobial treatment, the evolution was marked by multiple organ failure and the patient died on day one. the six cases were likely to have been acquired in Mahajanga, a favorite tourist destination in Madagascar. all cases were likely to have been acquired by multilocus sequencing typing (MLST; Godoy et al.) the first symptoms appeared during the last days of a stay (couple of weeks) in Mahajanga Frequent travels to Mahajanga for entertainment (beach sports and fishing) lasting usually for 3 weeks every 3 or 4 months including during the rainy season. anga has a tropical wet and dry/savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification [13], with a pronounced dry season in the low-sun months, no cold season, and a wet season in the high-sun months (from November to April) a total of 11 soil and water samples were collected, among which was a12, a dark, dry, turf-like soil sold as fertilizer/manure by a local supplier. MLST of soil isolates identified two novel STs: ST-1430 (4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1) and ST-1431 (1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1) from A12 and A4, respectively. the isolate from case #10 (owner of the yard where the B. pseudomallei isolates were found) nosocomial cases #3 [9] 2004 R\u00e9union Island * 0 Not typed, nosocomial cases #4 [15] 2004 Mauritius 0 4 12 34 2 5 2 1 1549 ST1549 is a single locus variant of ST1053 (case #8), ST1054 (case #9), ST1260 (case #1), and 1433 (case #5) #5 [10] 2005 Madagascar (1st admission)/R\u00e9union Island (2nd admission) ST1430 is a single locus variant of ST1432 (case #11) #14 [2] 2017 R\u00e9union Island Southeast Asia Not typed Environmental isolates E1 [This study] 2014 Soil from the garden of case 9 (A4) N/A 4 2 3 1 5 2 1 1430 Same ST as case #13. none of four soil samples taken from this location were positive for B. pseudomallei, either by culture or PCR. MLST characterization of B. pseudomallei isolates has enabled us to identify ST-27 isolates from both the Paris zoo outbreak and a 1977 soil isolate from a zoo in Antananarivo. this previously unreported ST overlap suggests the possibility of transmission of B. pseudomallei between these two regions. in 2006, B. pseudomallei was isolated from a swab from a leg wound of a Bangladeshi worker. the patient was not diabetic and not generally unwell. it is possible he acquired the infection in Bangladesh, with reactivation of infection from a latent focus occurring several months later. bacterium was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, doxycycline, and resistant to all aminoglycosides and colistin according to EUCAST criteria. he was discharged, but used a peripheral catheter to complete a 4-week course of ceftazidime and oral doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. no risk factors for exposure were identified. TB-CT scan revealed cerebral venous thrombosis, multiple bilateral lung abscesses, a liver abscess, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. despite immediate antimicrobial therapy with high doses of meropenem and amikacin, blood cultures remained positive until day 10. two patients were hospitalized at seychelles Hospital with a history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. they were both cooks from the same facility and had a history of illicit substance abuse. the initial diagnosis was MERS-CoV, legionellosis, or possible tuberculosis. three studies to date have used WGS to investigate B. pseudomallei strains from western Indian Ocean islands. they were the first to identify an Asian origin for the bacterium. the introduction of this bacterium into Madagascar was likely associated with the migration of Austronesian peoples (or their animals) from Indonesian Borneo. the first human case of melioidosis in the region was detected in may 2004 in a 60-year-old frenchman living in a city on the northwestern coast of Madagascar. he was admitted to an intensive care unit for management of respiratory distress and septic shock. about 20 or 30 years before the onset of the disease, he had lived for an unknown period of time in Vietnam. the patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Antananarivo. he was treated for ten days with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin. five days later he became feverish again and was referred to a hospital. the fifth case in Madagascar was a 44-year-old frenchman admitted with acute anuria and fever to the emergency service of a Belgian hospital near the french border in march 2013. he had a severe inflammatory syndrome, spondylodiscitis at L1, lung infiltrates, pyelonephritis, and a prostatic abscess. the patient was discharged for few days until the real causative agent was identified. a total body-computed tomography scan showed multiple bilateral lung abscesses, a liver abscess, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. despite immediate antimicrobial treatment, the evolution was marked by multiple organ failure and the patient died on day one. all cases were likely to have been acquired in Mahajanga, a favorite tourist destination in Madagascar. all cases were likely to have been acquired by multilocus sequencing typing (MLST; Godoy et al.) the first symptoms appeared during the last days of a stay (couple of weeks) in Mahajanga Frequent travels to Mahajanga for entertainment (beach sports and fishing) lasting usually for 3 weeks every 3 or 4 months including during the rainy season. soil investigation was carried out in the yard of the fifth case from Madagascar. a total of 11 soil and water samples (Figure A1) were collected. soil samples A4, A5, and A7-9 had been augmented with the dark soil A12. MLST of soil isolates identified two novel STs: ST-1430 (4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1) and ST-1431 (1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1) from A12 and A4, respectively.

TB-CT scan revealed cerebral venous thrombosis, multiple bilateral lung abscesses, a liver abscess, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. despite immediate antimicrobial therapy with high doses of meropenem and amikacin, blood cultures remained positive until day 10. two patients were hospitalized at seychelles Hospital with a history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. they were both cooks from the same facility and had a history of illicit substance abuse. the initial diagnosis was MERS-CoV, legionellosis, or possible tuberculosis. three studies to date have used WGS to investigate B. pseudomallei strains from western Indian Ocean islands. they were the first to identify an Asian origin for the Madagascan B. pseudomallei strains included in the phylogenetic analysis. the mechanism/s of B. pseudomallei dissemination to other western Indian Ocean islands is not yet well understood, but likely that it has also been anthropogenically driven. the association between rainfall and melioidosis has been well demonstrated in hyperendemic regions, with 75% and 85% of cases occurring during the wet season in northeastern Thailand and northern Australia. contaminated soil highlights the risk of occupational or recreational exposure to B. pseudomallei, and predisposing risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung or renal diseases, or hazardous alcohol use. melioidosis can be confused with tuberculosis or plague. melioidosis septicemia is the most severe form of the infection. it presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension. no systematic case finding of B. pseudomallei infection has been conducted in the western Indian Ocean islands. there is no awareness of melioidosis in the population and among clinicians, because its diagnosis has been rare. some laboratory technicians and the clinical microbiologists who diagnosed the cases are aware that B. pseudomallei is a possibility. colonies with morphology typical for B. pseudomallei were subcultured onto chocolate agar. colonies were identified by basic screening tests (Gram stain, oxidase test), rapid detection of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) produced by B. pseudomallei. DNA was eluted in 100 L of 10mM Tris HCl. 4 L of DNA were amplified in duplicates in 25 L volumes. PCR was performed on a thermocycler. MLSTF The molecular typing tool multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was developed by Brian Spratt at Imperial College London as the initial phylogenetic tool for population analysis of B. pseudomallei [7]. for each locus, the PCR mixture contained 0.5 U FIREPol DNA polymerase (Solis Biodine, Tartu, Estonia), 200 nM of primers, 1 buffer master mix FIREPol Master Mix Ready to Load (2.5 mM Mg s from different geographical locations due to high inter-laboratory reproducibility."}
