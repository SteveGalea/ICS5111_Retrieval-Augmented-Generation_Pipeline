{"summary": "in total, 52 infectious diseases were included in this study. the disease burden (in DALYs) and number of publications were well correlated. the regression line between the two variables in 2010\u20132017 was drawn. Cystic echinococcosis [Dengue]; Diphtheria [Diphtheria]; Diphtheria [Diphtheria]; Diphtheria [Dracunculiasis]; Cystic echinococcosis [Echinococcosis]; Gonococcal infection [Gonorrhea]; Hepatitis A [HepA]; Hepatitis C (acute and double logarithmic plot of disease burden (in DALYs) against research intensity (number of publications) for 52 infectious diseases at a global level in 2010\u20132017. the regression line and its 95% prediction interval were drawn. hepatitis B showed significantly high BARI only in the model by linear correlation. the intensity for hepatitis B did not reach statistical significance in a model assuming logarithmic correlation. of infectious disease showed no obvious tendencies by category (all P > 0.05) the median indices were slightly lower for diseases with middle and high compared with low disease burden, diseases due to bacteria and parasites compared with viral diseases. non-NTDs compared with NTDs. high research intensity for Campylobacter enteritis in high-income countries. low intensity in low and lower-middle income countries. high research intensity for cholera in Asia, Western Europe, and North America. the disease burden (in DALYs) and number of publications were well correlated. the regression line between the two variables in 2010\u20132017 was drawn excluding diseases considered outliers. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis by Clostridium difficile [C. difficile]; Campylobacter enteritis; Chagas disease [Chagas]; Chlamydial infection including sexual diseases and trachoma [Chlamydia]; Cholera [Cholera]; Cryptosporidiosis; Cystic echinococcosis; Gonococcal infection [Gonorrhea]; Acute hepatitis A [Hep ingococcal meningitis; salmonella infections other than typhoid/paratyphoid fevers; norovirus infection [Norovirus]; Onchocerciasis; Paratyphoid fever; Pertussis; Rabies; Rotaviral enteritis; RSV; Schistosomiasis; Shigellosis; Syphilis; Tetanus. double logarithmic plot of disease burden (in DALYs) against research intensity (number of publications) for 52 infectious diseases at a global level in 2010\u20132017. the regression line and its 95% prediction interval were drawn. the diseases are ordered according to the index in the 2010s. black dots indicate neglected tropical diseases. slanted arrows indicate diseases with significant change in the BARI over the three decades. we analyzed the BARI at country level for 45 countries. we identified six characteristic patterns in the indices. diseases for which the country level BARI was high in most countries. in most countries, adenovirus, diphtheria, Genital herpes, Hib, Meningococcal meningitis; Paratyphoid fever; RSV; Tetanus 4: Depended on region or economic level Amoebiasis; C. difficile; Campylobacter; Cholera; Cysticercosis; Echinococcosis; HepA; Hookworm; Trichuriasis; Yellow fever paratyphoid fever, which is a non-NTD with significantly low BARI, attracted insufficient attention from researchers in most countries. raising awareness at a global level to facilitate research may be required not only for those NTDs, but for non-NTDs with low research intensity. a double logarithmic linear relationship between the two indicators. we also tested the correlation in linear scale and confirmed the robustness of our results. the simple correlation approach will not specify how much research activity diseases should be receiving. the number of studies on each infectious disease (research intensity) was obtained from PubMed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) the name of a disease and causing agent were used as search terms. the number of publications about malaria was obtained using the search term [\u201cMalaria\u201d OR \u201cPlasmodium\u201d]. the correlation between DALYs and the number of publications was tested again. a change in the index of >1.0 (=single SD) over the three decades with P 0.05 by the Jonckheere test was considered significant. all types of publications, including original research, meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports, were included in the publication count. disease burden (measured in DALYs) and the number of publications were acquired at global and country levels. countries that published 1,000 medical articles between 1996 and 2017 were excluded. the residual from the new regression line was used as the BARI index. the index was calculated using DALYs in 2010 and the number of publications in 2010\u20132017."}
