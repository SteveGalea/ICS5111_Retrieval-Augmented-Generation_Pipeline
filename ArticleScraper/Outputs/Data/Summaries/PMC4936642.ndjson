{"summary": "METHODS Construction and Expression of CHIKV Specific dMAbs Gene sequence information for an established anti\u2013Env-specific CHIKV neutralizing human mAb were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information database. human embryonic kidney 293T cells and Vero cells, used for expression confirmation studies, were maintained as described previously [12] western blot analysis of IgG expression CHIKV (viral isolate PC08) infected cells were lysed two days post infection. dMAb DNA Plasmid Administration and In Vivo Analysis CVM1-Fab and CVM1-IgG expression kinetics and functionality were evaluated. two or 35 days after DNA delivery, mice were challenged with 107 plaque-forming units (25 L) of the viral isolate CHIKV Del-03 (JN578247) [34] either subcutaneously (in the dorsal side of each hind foot) or intranasally (12) the animals were monitored daily (for up to 20 days after infection) for survival and signs of infection. Quantitative Analysis Sera were collected from mice injected with CVM1-Fab, CVM1-IgG, or CHIKV Env, as well as those challenged with CHIKV. a student t test or a nonparametric Spearman correlation test were performed using GraphPad Prism software (Prism, La Jolla, California) 100 g of pVax1 DNA, CVM1-IgG, or CVM1-Fab (100 g of each VH and VL construct) was used. the CHIKV Env\u2013based DNA vaccine was developed and characterized as previously described. pVax1, CVM1-IgG, or 100 g of each plasmid chain of CVM1-Fab were injected 3 times at 2-week intervals. all injections followed immediately by delivery of CHIKV dMAb DNA plasmid via electroporation. mice received a single (100 g) electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection of pVax1 plasmid. LR2006-OPY1 (Indian Ocean Outbreak), SL-CH1 (Asian-clade), Ross (ECSA-clade), and PC08 and DRDE-06 (ECSA-clade) Neutralization titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution mediating 100% reduction of the cytopathic effects in the Vero cell monolayer. light and heavy immunoglobulin chains of a neutralizing anti-CHIKV mAb were designed [23, 24] using previously described methods. the complementary DNAs for the coding sequences of the VL and VH immunoglobulin chains for full-length anti-CHIKV dMAb were optimized for increased expression. for the constructs expressing anti-CHIKV-Fab, the VH and VL genes were cloned separately. samples were analyzed at 0, 24, and 48 hours post-transfection. cells transfected with an empty backbone pVax1 plasmid served as a negative control. injection of pVax1 vector was used a negative control. sera from mice injected with CVM1-IgG were tested against fixed CHIKV PC08\u2013infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence assays. the results indicated binding of the sera antibodies to the CHIKV. the detection of CHIKV E2 protein (50 kDa) expression in total cell lysate from CHIKV-infected cells indicates specificity of CVM1-IgG expression. the specificity of in vivo\u2013produced CVM1-IgG antibody was further demonstrated through FACS analysis against cells infected with green fluorescent protein\u2013encoded CHIKV. s were reprobed with antibody against -actin was used as a loading control. x-axis indicates green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining using the lentiviral GFP pseudovirus complemented with CHIKV Env. sera from CVM1-IgG\u2013injected mice effectively neutralized all 6 CHIKV isolates. similar results were observed using sera from CVM1-Fab\u2013injected mice. these data indicate that antibodies produced in vivo by CVM1-IgG constructs have relevant biological activity. two groups of mice were injected with 100 g of pVax1 (negative control), followed by viral challenge on day 2 with either subcutaneous (C) or intranasal (D) inoculation. survival rates were recorded for 20 days after the viral challenge. subcutaneous versus intranasal viral challenge was evaluated. groups of 20 mice received a single administration of pVax1 or CVM1-IgG. half (ie, 10) were challenged with CHIKV via a subcutaneous or intranasal route 2 days after injection. CVM1-immunoglobulin G (IgG) conferred protective immunity more rapidly than the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine (P =.0026). chikungunya virus envelope protein (Env) DNA vaccine. a long-term CHIKV challenge protection study was performed on day 35. the multibooster delivery of the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine conferred 100% protection. 80% survival was observed in mice administered CVM1-IgG (P =.0007) half of the animals were challenged with CHIKV at day 2 and the other half at day 35. survival percentage decreased to approximately 30% by 4 days after challenge in control (pVax1) animals had 100% long-term survival. both CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env DNA vaccine can be administered simultaneously without reciprocal interference. findings suggest a single injection with CVM1-IgG suppresses CHIKV-associated pathology to an extent comparable to that induced by protective vaccination. each data point represents the average viral titers from 10 mice. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. CHIKV dMAb were optimized for increased expression and cloned into a pVax1 vector. the synthetic plasmids were designated CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, for the IgG and Fab antibodies. human 293T cells were transfected with either the CVM1-IgG plasmid or the CVM1-Fab (VL, VH, or combined) plasmids. mice aged 5\u20136 weeks were administered 100 g of CVM1-IgG, CVM1-VH, CVM1-VL, or control vector by a single intramuscular electroporation-mediated injection. injection of a pVax1 vector was used a negative control. sera collected 15 days after injection from both constructs bound to CHIKV Env protein but not to an unrelated control antigen, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env. sera from mice injected with CVM1-IgG were tested against fixed CHIKV PC08\u2013infected Vero cells. CHIKV-infected cells indicates specificity of CVM1-IgG expression. the specificity of in vivo\u2013produced CVM1-IgG antibody was further demonstrated through FACS analysis against cells infected with green fluorescent protein\u2013encoded CHIKV. together, these findings indicate a strong specificity of the antibody generated from the CVM1-IgG plasmid. x-axis indicates green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining using lentiviral GFP pseudovirus complemented with CHIKV Env. presence and number of double-positive cells indicate presence and level of sera binding to CHIKV-infected cells. similar results were observed using sera from CVM1-Fab\u2013injected mice. these data indicate that antibodies produced in vivo by CVM1-IgG constructs have relevant biological activity. antibodies produced in vivo by CVM1-IgG constructs have relevant biological activity (ie, binding and neutralizing activity against CHIKV) two groups of mice were injected with 100 g of CVM1-IgG by the intramuscular route, followed by viral challenge on day 2 with either subcutaneous (C) or intranasal (D) inoculation. survival rates were recorded for 20 days after the viral challenge. groups of 20 mice received a single administration of pVax1 or CVM1-IgG. half (ie, 10) were challenged with CHIKV via a subcutaneous or intranasal route 2 days after injection. a novel consensus-based DNA vaccine was developed by our laboratory. BALB/c mice were injected with 100 g of CVM1-IgG, 100 g of pVax1 (negative control) or 25 g of CHIKV-Env DNA on day 0 and challenged on day 2 with CHIKV Del-03 (JN578247; 1 107 plaque-forming units in a total volume of 25 L) groups of 20 BALB/c mice were administered either a single injection of 100 g of CVM1- a long-term CHIKV challenge protection study was performed on day 35. the multibooster delivery of the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine conferred 100% protection. 80% survival was observed in mice administered CVM1-IgG (P =.0007) results of the day 2 CHIKV challenge experiment indicated the utility of the CVM1-IgG reagent in mediating protection from infection. survival percentage decreased to approximately 30% by 4 days after challenge in control animals. both human IgG and mouse IgG were detected and exhibited different expression kinetics. CVM1-IgG Administration Reduces CHIKV Loads and Proinflammatory Cytokine Levels Previous studies identified molecular correlates of CHIKV-associated disease severity. mice immunized with CVM1 IgG, CVM1 Fab, CHIKV Env, or CVM1 IgG plus CHIKV Env DNA vaccine generated mAb and significantly reduced viral loads. each data point represents the average viral titers from 10 mice. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. passive transfer of sera from mice immunized with a CHIKV Env DNA vaccine protected naive mice from lethal CHIKV challenge [12], highlighting the utility of antibody-based therapy. study demonstrates the utility of electroporation-mediated delivery of optimized DNA plasmids for the in vivo rapid production of biologically functional mAbs. 1-IgG and CHIKV Env produced rapid and persistent humoral and cellular immunity. codelivery of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env was not antagonistic in terms of the development of short- or long-term protective immune responses."}
