{"summary": "the importance of transmembrane domains in protein oligomerization has been shown for several cellular proteins. for example, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) TM must dimerize for the generation of amyloid, which is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (1). targeting the NRP1 TM domain with synthetic peptides could inhibit glioma tumor growth in vivo (3). enveloped virus requires fusion of the viral envelope with a target cell membrane. the receptor binding step mediated by the attachment protein, the interaction between the attachment protein and the fusion protein that facilitates triggering of F and the overall refolding of the fusion protein necessary for membrane fusion. homologous TM protein constructs containing the Hendra virus F TM and limited flanking sequences were coexpressed with the full-length protein. a synthetic TM peptide homologous to the PIV5 F TM domain successfully inhibited viral infection in cells. cells were starved for 45 min, radiolabeled for 30 min, and chased for 1.5 h. RESULTS HeV F TM proteins interact with the full-length HeV F. three constructs were synthesized to contain a signal peptide, a variable-length linker, the full-length TM domain and C tail. a signal peptide was included to target the TM constructs to the endoplasmic reticulum. wild-type (WT) HeV F (green) and each of the TM proteins (red) colocalized in similar regions throughout the cell. a strong signal appeared near the nucleus at the expected location of the ER. these constructs were then coexpressed with the full-length HeV F protein. a pulse-chase experiment was performed to determine whether the TM proteins affected initial F protein synthesis or stability over time. however, the overall expression of F was not affected at the earlier time points for LL or HRB TM protein coexpression. the HRB TM protein appeared to have a less dramatic effect but still showed a reduced amount of either form of F at 8 h. in the presence of each of the TM proteins at the earlier time points (0 to 2 h), a band appeared between the F0 and F1 bands, which might have been a degradation product or the result of a change in glycosylation. the effects of exogenous TM construct coexpression on protein oligomerization were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HeV F antibody to the C tail; heated at various temperatures to destabilize oligomeric interactions. a syncytium fusion assay was used to determine whether the TM proteins affected F protein function. the TM proteins were coexpressed with each of the TM constructs. after 24 h, the cells were imaged to visualize syncytium formation. luciferase reporter gene assay experimental setup showed experimental condition 1 and condition 2. results are representative of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. fusion in the presence of the HRB construct reduced fusion to levels consistent with that expected with the cleaved population of F present at the cell surface. however, it may suggest that this construct has an effect on fusion pore expansion or other cellular rearrangements needed for syncytium formation. a luciferase gene reporter assay was again employed to investigate the effects the exogenous TM peptides had when located in the target cell membrane. the predicted TM domain sequences of HeV and PIV5 F exhibit approximately 40% homology. the TM proteins did not co-IP the PIV5 F protein in its F0 or F1 form. the TM proteins did not co-localize with PIV5 F in immunofluorescence staining. TM constructs compared to that of PIV5 F+mock were determined by band density. Syncytium formation assay revealed coexpression of TM constructs did not inhibit PIV5 F fusion activity. TM peptide reduced the number of GFP-expressing cells for PIV5. addition of 10 M peptide resulted in approximately 75% reduction in PIV5 infection. TM domain can be targeted to disrupt F protein function and viral infection in a sequence-specific manner. a strong signal appeared near the nucleus at the expected location of the ER. a plasmid encoding an HA-tagged HeV F protein was cotransfected with the mock control. a plasmid encoding an HA-tagged HeV F protein was cotransfected with the mock control. exogenous TM proteins affect HeV F expression and protein stability. a small population of cleaved, potentially fusogenically active F was detected at the surface. the majority of F was detected in its uncleaved form, F0. by 8 h, the majority of F was present in the cleaved form (F1+F2; only F1 was visible on the gel) however, the overall expression of F was not affected at the earlier time points for LL or HRB TM protein coexpression. destabilized the full-length F protein but did not affect the ability of synthesized protein to be cleaved to its fusogenically active form. surface biotinylation was used to analyze total and surface populations of HeV F cotransfected with mock empty vector or each of the TM constructs. proteins were radiolabeled for 30 min, with the chase times noted above each gel in hours. expressed alone, a majority of the protein migrated as a monomer. however, heat-stable trimers and dimers are also detectable. a small population of fusogenically active HeV F was still detected in the surface population. previous work demonstrated that reduction of HeV F expression to these levels resulted in fusion levels at 30 to 40% of the wild-type level. the lack of fusion seen may be the result of premature triggering or misfolding of the fusion protein present at the plasma membrane. the presence of the TM proteins could prevent the fusion protein from being able to fully trigger or affect further conformational changes needed to drive fusion. each of the TM constructs was coexpressed in vero cells at a ratio of 1:1. after 3 h, the cells were lysed and incubated with luciferin. luminescence was measured as an output of the fusion. fusion in the presence of the HRB construct reduced fusion to background levels. the SL and HRB TM proteins were present in the target cell membrane. the LL TM protein did not produce a significant reduction in fusion. this reduction may be due to disruption of proper refolding of HeV F or destabilization of the fusion peptides. arrows indicate that the TM constructs designed to target the HeV F TM domain do not produce the same effects on PIV5 F expression or fusion activity. the effect is sequence specific, suggesting that the effect is sequence specific. a peptide was designed based on the sequence of the PIV5 F TM domain. the highly hydrophobic peptide was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the viruses were incubated with varying concentrations of peptide for 30 min. after 24 h, the cells were imaged and prepared for flow cytometry to count GFP-expressing cells. DISCUSSION Viral fusion proteins drive the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. disruption of TM-TM association by mutagenesis resulted in a HeV F protein that triggered prematurely (11, 18) fusion process involves a series of steps, including attachment protein-mediated receptor binding. a triggering event of the fusion protein facilitated by the attachment protein. a dramatic, irreversible conformational change to merge the cellular and viral membranes to form a fusion pore. tium formation suggests downstream cellular rearrangements may be blocked even when fusion pore formation and expansion have occurred. a small but significant decrease was seen with the addition of the TM domain and the fusion peptide of HeV F in the target membrane. this demonstrates that the exogenous TM domain alone can create effects similar to those seen in the cellular experiments. the effects on protein stabilization and fusion activity in the presence of the HRB construct were less dramatic than when the SL or LL construct was present. this could impair the ability of the HRB construct to interact with the native F protein. the specificity of the effect of exogenous TM protein was determined by coexpressing PIV5 F with the HeV F TM-containing proteins in cellular experiments. Neither PIV5 F nor HMPV F demonstrated a significant effect on expression or function in the presence of a nonhomologous exogenous TM construct or peptide. a small molecule targeting the TM domain could disrupt homotrimerization of latent membrane protein 1. other studies have shown that targeting antiviral peptides to the cell membrane with cholesterol enhanced efficacy (38) the inclusion of some portion of the TM domain may be able to further enhance specificity, in addition to physically anchoring the peptide. the Hendra virus F TM constructs were synthesized with GenScript. each construct was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS. anti-peptide antibodies were used to pull down F and the TM proteins. goat anti-mouse\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and goat anti-mouse\u2013tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC) used for immunofluorescence assays were goat anti-mouse\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) supernatants incubated at 4\u00b0C for 3 h with rocking and then incubated with 30 l of protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) the immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed two times with each of the following. immunoprecipitation with the anti-peptide Hendra virus F antibody and protein A-sepharose beads and analysis were performed as described for surface biotinylation. the next day, the cells were washed with PBS and starved for 45 min at 37\u00b0C in cysteine-methionine-deficient DMEM. the cells were then labeled for 30 min with Tran35S metabolic label.
