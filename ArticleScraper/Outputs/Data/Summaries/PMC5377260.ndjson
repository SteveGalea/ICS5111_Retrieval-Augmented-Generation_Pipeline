{"summary": "the object of study is a venue in dalian, which covers a total area of 36400 m2 and building area is 17320 m2. the aboveground part includes a swimming pool, ball training venues, gymnasium, the lounge room and the clinic. the entire building is centralized-controlled by the central air conditioning room. samples of sterile water containing organic substances were prepared in 10 times and 100 times diluted concentration, respectively. the samples in the dust were 10 times and 100 times diluted and 100 L of the sample was inoculated into the two kinds of solid culture media. the aboveground part includes a swimming pool, ball training venues, gymnasium, the lounge room and the clinic. the entire building is centralized-controlled by the central air conditioning room. two measured units were all air system, which only had a coarse efficiency filter, and the unit is also provided with a heater, cooler and fan etc. sterile water containing organic substances were prepared in 10 times and 100 times diluted concentration, respectively. the samples in the dust were 10 times and 100 times diluted and 100 L of the sample was inoculated into the two kinds of solid culture media. the humidity of unit A is higher, and the temperature is lower. the distribution density of bacteria and fungi in the unit A is obtained through statistics. the concentration of airborne fungus was 44 cfu/m3, and the concentration of airborne bacteria was 16 cfu/m3. the comparison between unit A and B indicates that the bacterial density in unit A was less than that in the same sampling point in unit B. the fungal density in unit A was more than that in the same sampling point in unit B. the qualified total DNA was used for preparation of amplicon libraries at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China). for PCR product, the jagged ends of DNA fragment would be converted into blunt ends by using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase. after all that, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads. Rank OTU curve is a form of species diversity in the sample. the richness and evenness of species in the samples represented by the horizontal length of the curve is wide. the uniformity of species in the samples from the curve reflects the longitudinal axis of the shape. the greater the two indices are, the more abundant species is in the sample. the species observed index reflects the diversity of the community in the sample. the greater the evenness of the species is in the community, the greater the diversity of the community is. the similarity of species diversity in two sampling points of unit B was very high. the species with the largest proportion is the dominant fungi. study of growth prediction model of the fungi in air conditioning systems. the models were fitted by Origin software (version 8) and Matlab R2014a. the fitting conditions of Logistic model and Gompertz model were compared. temperature gradient of 20 \u00b0C 25 \u00b0C 30 \u00b0C and relative humidity gradient of 45%60%75%80% were selected as experimental hygrothermal conditions. it can be known that growth rate of Cladosporium spp. is faster than that of Penicillium spp., in any experimental conditions, is hygrothermal response control method cannot change. the model\u2019s fitting effect is excellent, and R2 is greater than 0.99; at 25 \u00b0C temperatures, the model fitting effect is not as good as other temperature conditions. the model fitting effect is better than other temperature conditions. the fitting of Logistic model to the growth of the fungus is better than that of the Gompertz model. the two models are tested by the deviation factor Bf and the accuracy factor Af in the mathematical model test. the value of the growth rate of the Cladosporium colony growth rate (instantaneous velocity) was obtained. the model fitting of predicting growth of Cladosporium was shown as Fig. 10. the distribution density of bacteria and fungi in the unit A is obtained through statistics, as shown in Fig. 2. The concentration of airborne fungus was 44 cfu/m3, and the concentration of airborne bacteria was 16 cfu/m3. the fungal contamination in the air is more serious than the bacteria. the unit internal is unprecedentedly narrow and low intensity of illumination in a closed state. it is easy to trample damage to the underground pipes, which leads to the disinfection and cleaning work rarely in the unit. fusion primer with dual index and adapters for PCR. fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads too. only the qualified library can be used for sequencing. the gene sequence of the test samples from genome sequencing was dealed with, such as stitching and matching. the sample had a total of 59309 high quality fungal sequences, with an average length of 219 bp. the optimized sequence and the average length of the sample are shown in Table 2. the species observed index reflects the richness of the community in the sample. the greater the evenness of the species is in the community, the greater the diversity of the community is. the results are shown in Table 3. The species with the largest proportion is the dominant fungi. Figure 6. The taxonomic composition distribution in samples of Genus-level. growth kinetics prediction model of Cladosporium spp. was established to predict the rapid fungal growth in the experimental conditions. the models were fitted by Origin software (version 8) and Matlab R2014a. the fitting conditions of Logistic model and Gompertz model were compared. growth rate of Cladosporium spp. is faster than that of Penicillium spp., in any experimental conditions, is hygrothermal response control method cannot change. low RH environments can reduce or even inhibit fungal growth. Gompertz model is the basic model for predicting the growth of microorganisms. the model is well fitted at the temperature of 25 \u00b0C and the fitting effect is better than that of the Gompertz model. the square root model fitting based on the two environmental factors is feasible and credible. it is necessary to study the influence of two environmental factors on the growth of fungi. the measured value of the growth rate of Cladosporium was obtained. the model fitting of predicting growth of Cladosporium was shown as Fig. 10. the model equation of Bf value was between 0.90\u20131.05. Alternaria spp., Candida spp., Cercospora spp. and Cladosporium spp. existed in both units. the composition of fungi in B was more complicated."}
