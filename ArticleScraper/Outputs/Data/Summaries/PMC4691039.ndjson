{"summary": "recent advances in genome-wide analysis indicate that large numbers of common variants shape individual disease risks. however, the biological mechanisms by which environmental factors affect brain development are poorly understood. the biological mechanisms by which environmental factors affect brain development are poorly understood. the offspring of pregnant mice or rats treated with polyI:C displayed behavioral abnormalities such as augmentation of psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity and impairment of social interaction, prepulse inhibition (PPI) and memory [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28], which are considered behavioral phenotypes. the offspring after maternal polyI:C treatment reproduce the neuropathological features characteristic of schizophrenia [30,31,32], which include reduced dendritic spine density, decreased oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and NG2-positive cells are major cell populations in the CNS. astrocytes play a key role in normal brain development and synaptic formation. astrocytes also coordinate immune response to invading pathogens and peripheral inflammatory factors. polyI:C and viral nucleic acids supposedly target the TLR 3 of astrocytes in either the brain or the BBB. morphological and functional abnormalities of astrocytes have been reported in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and schizophrenia. IL-6 derived from dam following maternal polyI:C treatment mediates the effects of MIA on the brain development of the fetus [27] also results in impairments in PPI and latent inhibition in the adult offspring [27], both of which are linked to schizophrenia and ASD [74,75,76,77], respectively. interferon-induced transmembrane 3 interferons prevent incursion of viral genomes from the endosomal cascade. mice with IFITM3 deficiency exhibit accelerated progression, and higher mortality as well as systemic viral burdens following influenza A. pregnant mice received once-daily intravenous injections of polyI:C. the fetal cortices and hippocampi were removed 12 h after the final injection. the fetal cortices and hippocampi were removed 12 h after the final injection. associations have been reported between schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease of polymorphism on the MMP3 promoter. this suggests that MMP3 released by astrocytes disrupts neuron\u2013glia interaction, leading to neurodevelopmental impairments. further studies are required to elucidate which MMP3 substrates contribute to the impairment of neuronal development. pregnant mice with MIA by polyI:C treatment exhibit alterations in gut physiology, microbial composition, and profile of metabolic products. bacteroides fragilis probiotic suggests microbiome-mediated therapies may be a safe and effective treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. endosomal IFITM3 in astrocytes modulates their endocytic activity. these abnormalities impair neuronal development, resulting in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and ASD."}
