{"summary": "in a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age ( 10 years), sex and village of residence. we collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers. hematemesis was due to predisposing conditions and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) hematemesis refers to the vomiting of blood, which indicates acute gastro-intestinal bleeding. common causes of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding include peptic ulcers, cirrhosis with oesophageal or gastric varices, gastritis and esophagitis of various etiology. national census, Hoima has a population of 573,903 while Buliisa District has a population of 113,569. we found cases by reviewing health facility records from June 2015 to September 2015. we also visited affected communities to search for cases using the case definition. multiple biological specimens from 19 patients were collected and tested for a battery of VHFs (including Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) viruses. PCR tests were conducted at the centers for disease control and prevention/Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) participants identified as patients were referred for free treatment at Hoima Regional Referral Hospital. the attack rate in Buliisa District was 15/100,000 while that in Hoima District was 5.2/100,000. the peak occurred in the middle of September after the ministry of health started community mobilization and active case-finding. in the case-control study, we found statistically significant associations between self-reported history of liver disease and hematemesis and self-reported history of ulcer disease and hematemesis. in the case-control study, we found statistically significant associations between self-reported history of liver disease and hematemesis. substance used before case-patient\u2019s onset Indomethacin 3/11 11/81 27 14 6.0 (1.0-36) Ibuprofen 2/11 7/81 18 8.6 2.0 (0.35-12) Alcohol use 2/3 20/37 67 55 1.8 (0.15-22) hematemesis was the initial symptom for 35% (11/31) of the patients. autopsy showed 58% (18/31) of the patients had an ulcer located in the duodenum. 6 of the cases resulted in deaths; all 6 deceased persons were between the ages of 35 and 60 years. in a study conducted in the united kingdom, 8 (44%) developed gastrointestinal related complications and 1 died. the relative risk associated with the use of NSAIDs was 4.7 (95% CI: 3.8-5.7). the clinical presentation of a distended abdomen among some of the case patients is of particular interest. this investigation was initiated because the symptoms of initial patients were suggestive of VHFs. the investigation and response served as a \u201clive fire exercise\u201d for the surveillance and response capacity of the Ministry of Health. rapid response and control in Uganda and Nigeria were shown to effectively contain these emergencies and prevent them from becoming a public health crisis. people in rural communities in Uganda have been shown to have low access to health care [34], low satisfaction with and poor perceived accessibility of the health care services [35]. because of poor access to healthcare, it is possible that persons in our investigation were forced to self-medicate on drugs such as NSAIDs, which elevated their risk of developing hematemesis. people that reside around the shores of Lake Albert have been shown to have high prevalence of schistosomiasis infection in Uganda. what this study adds Pre-existing conditions such as ulcer diseases combined with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can aggravate hematemesis. inandi, atek Kagirita and Bao-Ping Zhu participated in data collection. inandi, atek Kagirita and Bao-Ping Zhu were involved in data collection."}
