{"summary": "the arenavirus GPC is unique among enveloped viruses in being the only viral glycoprotein described to retain the signal peptide as part of the infectious, virion-associated glycoprotein complex that forms heterotrimers. the role of viral glycoproteins of all enveloped viruses is 2-fold. the role of viral glycoproteins of all enveloped viruses is. studies comparing antibodies that react in CF and IFA to those effective in neutralization assays determined that the majority of the highly cross-reactive CF and IFA-directed antibodies were against the internal nucleoprotein of the virus. the minimally cross-reactive GPC-specific antibodies were the mediators of neutralization (7, 9, 23, 24) MACV and JUNV GPCs bind to and inhibit JUNV, but not MACV, pseudovirions. MACV GPCs obscure its RBS accessibility with adjacent structural modifications to evade interaction with neutralizing -JUNV antibodies. four neutralize JUNV infection (GD01, OD01, GB03, and QC03) none were reported to exhibit cross-reactivity to other NW arenaviruses, including MACV. three of these neutralizing MAbs were demonstrated recently to protect guinea pigs to various degrees against lethal JUNV challenge. blots were incubated with either a 1:500 dilution of each -JUNV GPC MAb or a 1:20 dilution each -MACV GP2 MAb. cells were transfected with empty vector; unfilled histograms represent cells transfected with the respective GPC plasmids. -JUNV GPC MAb concentrations providing 50% inhibition of JUNV/VSV transduction MAb against JUNV GPC IC50 (ng/ml) no neutralization was detected by LD05 or EB03. the epitopes targeted by LD05, OD01, EB03, and GB03 have not been identified. to confirm and extend others' observations that each of these MAbs is GP1-specific, we constructed a series of chimeric GPC structures in which the SSP, GP1 or GP2 segments of JUNV GPC (recXJ13) were mixed-matched with those of MACV (Carvallo) into six M/J combinations. Pseudovirion preparations were normalized to MACV-VSV (M) for matrix expression by dot blot analysis and applied to Vero cells in duplicate. transduction is represented as percentage of cells GFP-positive relative to MACV-VSV, as assessed by flow cytometry. all six anti-JUNV GPC MAbs bind to the GP1 domain of the GPC. this conclusion was further validated by neutralization assays. blot analysis of nondenatured M/J chimera-VSV-associated GPCs. bars are representative of two or three independent experiments with the indicated SEM. the results shown in panels A to C were determined contemporaneously with the findings depicted in Fig. 1A to C. nonneutralizing MAbs do not compete for GD01-specific epitopes within the RBS. the nonneutralizing MAbs, while binding to GP1 epitopes, do not compete for GD01-specific epitopes within the RBS. we used our M/J chimeras to determine whether the neutralizing capabilities of polyclonal antisera also mapped to GP1. sera from female IFNAR/ BALB/c mice (n 3) were evaluated for neutralizing activity against MACV-VSV, MACV-VSV, or PBS (-JUNV, -MACV, or normal mouse serum [NMS], respectively. antisera most robustly neutralized M/J chimeras that contained the autologous GP1, supporting previous conjecture that neutralizing antibodies from both MACV- and JUNV-specific antisera target the MACV GP1 avoids neutralization from the four neutralizing MAbs that target the RBS and -JUNV antisera. both viruses intimately engage with TfR1 using a clade-wide conserved pocket (27). contact residue comparisons between MACV GP1-TfR1 and JUNV GP1-GD01 were used to explain the mechanism of inhibition by MAb GD01 (26) GP1 region 4 (T168A, E186G, and S206P) is readily recognized by all six MAbs. use of the candid#1 sequence allowed for the successful production of MJM-1 and MJM-5 in addition to MJM-4 pseudovirions. the three amino acid residues that differ in the Candid#1 strain from the recXJ13 strain of JUNV are underlined. transduction is represented as the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to MJM-VSV. bars are representative of three independent pseudovirion preps with the indicated SEM. polyclonal antisera (-JUNV, -MACV, or NMS) was incubated with decreasing concentrations of each antiserum type or PBS prior to application to Vero cells. transduction is represented as the percent of GFP-positive cells relative to cells receiving PBS treatment, as assessed by flow cytometry. neutralizing MJM-4-VSV was significantly reduced compared to MJM-1 or MJM-5. but when region 4 of MACV is replaced with MACV sequence, the ability of the neutralizing antibodies to bind to GP1 is reduced or abolished. crystal structure analysis demonstrates that this is not the case, at least not for GD01. loop 10 within region 4 of MACV GP1 contributes to the RBS inaccessibility. an extra disulfide-bonded loop exists in MACV that is not present in JUNV or other clade B viruses that utilize TfR1 as a receptor. loop 10 narrows the opening of the RBS of MACV (Fig. 6A) loop 10 appears to be an important impediment to JUNV antisera interactions with MACV GPC. the loss of loop 10 was sufficient to induce notable cross-neutralization of M-loop10 by the -JUNV polyclonal antisera. transduction is represented as the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to MACV-VSV. bars are representative of three independent pseudovirion preparations with the indicated SEM. -JUNV GPC MAbs bind to and inhibit JUNV, but not MACV, pseudovirions. UNV GPC MAbs available through the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources) four neutralize JUNV infection (GD01, OD01, GB03, and QC03) none of these neutralizing MAbs were reported to exhibit cross-reactivity to other NW arenaviruses. -JUNV GPC MAbs bind to and inhibit JUNV but not MACV pseudovirions. blot analysis of nondenatured JUNV-VSV (J)- or MACV-VSV (M)-associated GPCs. cells were transfected with GPC-expressing plasmids at 48 h prior to staining. transduction is represented as the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to cells incubated with nonspecific MAb. bars are representative of two or three independent experiments with the indicated standard errors of the mean. york et al. used LD05 to pull down GP1 from GP1 transfected cell lysates and supernatants. GD01 MAb was recently shown to bind to GP1 RBS residues. QC03 competes with GD01 for GP1 binding (26). we found that the ratio was lower in virions containing JUNV GP2. this correlated with lower transduction levels, suggesting that the amount of GPC on the pseudovirion likely influences transduction. chimeric pseudovirions had demonstrable levels of transduction. all six anti-JUNV GPC MAbs bind to the GP1 domain of the GPC. we found that only M/J chimeras that contained a JUNV GP1 were recognized by any of the MAbs. this conclusion was further validated by neutralization assays. an ELISA assessing the capacity of each -JUNV GPC MAb to inhibit M/J chimera-VSV transduction was performed. the results were determined contemporaneously with the findings depicted in Fig. 1A to C. incubated with a mixture of biotinylated GD01 and one of each of the six -JUNV MAbs or a control MAb, SA06-AF08 (SA06) the results demonstrated that all four neutralizing MAbs competed for GD01 binding. the two nonneutralizing MAbs competed as poorly as the irrelevant MAb that served as the negative control. both MACV-VSV and JUNV-VSV vaccinations led to the production of strong self-neutralizing, but weak cross-neutralizing, antisera. pooled sera from female IFNAR/ BALB/c mice (n 3) were evaluated for neutralizing activity against MACV-VSV, MACV-VSV, or PBS. MACV antisera contain antibodies that are likely targeting epitopes available on both prefusion GPCs, whereas JUNV antisera do not. region 4 within GP1 plays a critical role in RBS accessibility for -JUNV neutralizing antibodies. the candid#1 GP1 sequence is readily recognized by all six MAbs and neutralized by all four neutralizing antibodies. the three amino acid residues that differ in the Candid#1 strain from the recXJ13 strain of JUNV are underlined. chimeric GPC pseudovirus studies substituting equivalent regions from the recXJ13 strain were more successful. contact TfR1, gray circles indicate JUNV GP1 residues only contacted by GD01. black circles indicate GP1 residues that are both predicted to contact TfR1 and interact with GD01. transduction competence among various MJM intraGP1 chimera-VSV pseudovirions. transduction is represented as the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to cells incubated with nonspecific MAb. bars are representative of two or three independent experiments with the indicated SEM. neutralizing MAbs are interacting with residues within region 4. the ability of -JUNV antisera to neutralize MJM-4-VSV was reduced. this effect extended to -JUNV polyclonal antisera, since the capacity of -JUNV antisera to neutralize MJM-4-VSV was considerably reduced compared to MJM-1. loop 10 within region 4 of MACV GP1 contributes to the RBS inaccessibility. an extra disulfide-bonded loop exists in MACV that is not present in JUNV or other clade B viruses that are known to utilize TfR1 as a receptor. this loop has been noted previously and termed loop 10 (25) blot does not allow MAb-mediated neutralization of MACV-VSV. however, we found no better neutralization by the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments than the full-length antibodies. additional changes such as specific residue changes in the RBS likely would be required to allow these -JUNV MAbs to bind to MACV GPC. dot blot analysis of nondenatured MACV-, JUNV-, or M-loop10-VSV-associated GPCs. transduction is represented as percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to MACV-VSV. a previous crystallographic study visualized one of the four neutralizing MAbs, GD01, bound to soluble JUNV GP1 RBS that bound (26). the two nonneutralizing MAbs did not compete for binding with the neutralizing MAbs, suggesting that the epitopes within JUNV GPC that lead to neutralization may be quite restricted. GP1 is the target of all neutralizing MAbs against these viruses. GB03, 0D01, and GD01 have been assessed for their efficacy as therapeutic strategies against lethal JUNV challenge. a new understanding stemming from structural studies of the NW arenavirus GP1s that the RBS resides within region 2 (25, 26) it is likely that region 4 of other NW arenaviruses may also interfere with availability of the RBS. MACV GP1 constraints prevent the binding of these MAbs. a MACV-derived vaccine construct may have greater potential for eliciting broadly specific antibodies. the only neutralizing GP2-specific MAb that has ever been characterized was elicited in mice vaccinated with purified and chemically denatured GP2 ectodomains. chimeric GPCs expressed and transduced very poorly or not at all. this was likely due to the structural incompatibility of some MACV/JUNV regions. chimeric constructs retained transduction competency. MACV (Carvallo) and JUNV (Candid#1; both kindly provided by Susan Ross, University of Illinois at Chicago) and JUNV (recXJ13; kindly provided by Jay Hooper, USAMRIID) GPC cDNA sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.1() plasmids. female IFNAR/ BALB/c mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age were intramuscularly injected with 108 transducing units of MACV GPC- or JUNV GPC-pseudotyped VSVG-eGFP or PBS in a total volume of 100 l. at 3 weeks postboost, the mice were boosted with the same treatment. the -VSV-matrix hybridoma, 23H12, was produced in-house through maintenance of the hybridoma. the hybridoma was supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% pen/strep, 1% nonessential amino acids. blots were visualized with a LI-COR Odyssey CLx Imaging System. pseudovirions were normalized for GP2 quantity using the MAb F106G3. a single concentration of each pseudovirus was assessed for surface staining experiments. vero cells were plated at 50,000 cells per well in 48-well tissue culture plates overnight. a transduction curve was produced for the parental pseudovirus. pseudoviruses were normalized to achieve 30% transduction. each MAb was added to a final concentration of 0.5 g/ml. tion, 200 l of medium was added to each replicate prior to application of entire volume to Vero cells in 48-well format described above for the transduction assays. the plates were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.15% [vol/vol] Tween 20) and blocked with 200 l of blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin [wt/vol] for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was terminated with 2 M H2SO4, and absorbance measurements were read at 450 nm on Synergy H1 hybrid microtiter plate (BioTek, USA) plasmids, pseudoviruses, antisera, MAbs, and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1() plasmids. supernatant pseudovirus was collected 24 h after a PBS wash, filtered through a 0.45-m-pore size syringe filter, and either frozen at 80\u00b0C in aliquots or concentrated and purified through ultracentrifugation. in cases of ultracentrifugation, pseudovirus stocks were distributed into aliquots and stored at 80\u00b0C. all -JUNV MAbs (GD01-AG02, 0.99 mg/ml; OD01-AA09, 1.00 mg/ml; EB03-AB11, 0.96 mg/ml; GB03-BE08, 0.99 mg/ml; QC03-BF11, 0.84 mg/ml) were developed by others and obtained through the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases-established organization, BEI Resources. ted with immobilized pepsin protease to selectively digest whole MAbs into F(ab\u2032)2 fragments that retain antigen binding activity. viruses were incubated in 5 lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.125% NP-40) before serial dilution in PBS. all dilutions were then directly applied to a nitrocellulose membrane via a dot blot apparatus. primary-stained cells were washed three times and incubated with IgG(H+L) secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:1,000 for 15 min on ice. secondary-stained cells were washed three times and subsequently analyzed via flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur. antiserum samples were diluted 10 in PBS, followed by 3 subsequent 2 dilutions. a 15-l portion of antiserum dilution was added to each 45-l aliquot of pseudovirus to achieve 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320 final antiserum dilutions. the plates were washed five times with wash buffer and incubated in 100 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. the plates were then washed and developed in 50 l of TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. the reaction was terminated with 2 M H2SO4, and absorbance measurements were read at 450 nm on Syn"}
