{"summary": "classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a small, enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae (1). there is an urgent need for the development of alternative control strategies, such as marker vaccines (2, 3). studies have suggested that C-strain CSFV is a potent inducer of type I T-cell responses. NK cells are triggered to kill or ignore transformed or pathogen-infected cells, depending on a balance of inhibitory and activating signals received through ligands on potential target cells. some pathogens can directly activate NK cells, such as influenza virus activation of human NK cells through hemagglutinin-NKp46 receptor binding (11) or murine cytomegalovirus-activating NK cells via the m157 glycoprotein-Ly49 receptor interaction (12), the a third NK cell population with a CD8/low NKp46high phenotype has been described in porcine spleens. studies of the role of porcine NK cells in the response to viral infection are limited, but there are data showing that porcine NK cell responses are impaired following infection with foot-and-mouth disease virus. the activation of T cells can be direct or indirect, mediated by the interaction with APCs, such as DCs. in humans and pigs, it has been shown that T cells can express CD8 and MHC-II molecules. in swine, T cells can express both CD8 and MHC-II molecules. an ex vivo analysis of NK and T cells in the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes from pigs vaccinated with virulent CSFV. a live attenuated C-strain CSFV and the virulent CSFV Brescia strain were propagated in PK15 cell monolayers. large white/Landrace crossbreed pigs, 6 to 24 months of age, were randomly assigned to one of four groups. five days prior to challenge, the animals in groups 1 (n = 6) and 3 (n = 12) were vaccinated intranasally with 105 the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of C-strain CSFV (1 ml divided equally between each nostril and administered using a mucosal atomization device. a total clinical score for each animal was assigned twice daily. temperatures were monitored by rectal thermometer readings and recorded once daily. each animal was stunned and euthanized by exsanguination. cells were washed twice in HBSS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were adjusted to a density of 1 107 to 2 107 cells/ml in cold 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in FBS and cryopreserved as described earlier. CSFV RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR as described previously (34) and normalized to 18S RNA using the Eukaryotic 18S rRNA endogenous control. samples from the tonsils were collected, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin wax. sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and then treated in hydrogen peroxide 3% in methanol for 15 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. normal goat serum (1:66 dilution) and normal pig serum (1:33 dilution) were added before being washed twice in TBST. the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with avidin-biotin complex (ABC Vector Elite; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom) a titration of recombinant porcine IFN- (R&D Systems) was added as a standard.

IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, or IFN- were detected in the supernatants of virus-infected pDC cultures. significantly higher levels of type I IFN and TNF- were detected in the supernatants of virus-infected pDC cultures compared to those of mDCs. the effects on MHC-II expression were assessed. ex vivo analysis of NK and T cells isolated from the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes of pigs vaccinated and/or challenged with CSFV. pigs developed clinical signs of CSF, viremia, and leukopenia (33) on day 0 postchallenge, there was some evidence of an upregulation of MHC-II on T cells in the draining lymph nodes from intranasally vaccinated animals. at this time point, there was a significantly greater proportion of MHC-II expressing NK and T cells in both the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes of the challenge control pigs compared to those that were vaccinated but unchallenged. the data represent the mean of 3 pigs/group/time point SEM. the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were collected longitudinally following C-strain vaccination. pDCs infected with CSFV released significantly smaller amounts of IFN- compared to pDCs. pDCs possess a functional type I IFN response to CSFV infection. IFN- is the prototypic antiviral cytokine, but also plays an important immunoregulatory role, enhancing both innate and adaptive immune responses. we report this effect on two nonconventional APCs, NK and T cells, in pigs. this may be explained by the more limited replication of C-strain in vivo. it is possible that some form of immune regulation is induced by C-strain infection, such as IL-10 induction, which may inhibit the pDC-mediated type I IFN response. pDCs can rapidly replicate in macrophages and mDCs. the ability of NK cells to express MHC-II after interaction with DCs has been described in mice. recombinant cytokines and supernatants derived from pDC cultures induced the upregulation of MHC-II on NK cells. viral cytokines, like IFN-, or perforin-mediated cytotoxic function, raise the possibility that CSFV actively inhibits this process. studies of HCV, another member of the Flaviviridae family, have shown that several viral proteins can either directly or indirectly, in the case of NS5A, inhibit human NK cell activation. data failed to show that these cells gained antiviral effector functions. it therefore appears unlikely that either population contribute directly to the rapid protection conferred by C-strain CSFV."}
