{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be overloaded with molecular chaperones, folding enzymes, and massive protein products during normal processes. dysfunction of the ER, known as ER stress, results from pathogenic stress signals, such as hypoxia, ER\u2013Ca2+ depletion, viral infections, or agents that affect Ca2+ balance. both models depend on retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates from the ER back to the cytoplasm. most soluble misfolded proteins are cleared through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p62 also recognizes K48 polyubiquitin-tagged proteins for autophagic clearance upon proteasome dysfunction. basal autophagy plays a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. it eliminates unwanted proteins and damaged organelles by cellular self-digestion in the lysosome to fulfill the demand for the building blocks required for cell survival. several lines of evidence suggest there is communication between these two pathways. these two pathways could be a therapeutic target in certain circumstances. this is a new antiviral strategy focusing on the regulation of the UPR. ER, trans-Golgi, or lysosomes are the likely origin of virally induced membranes. ER, trans-Golgi, or lysosomes are the likely origin of virally induced membranes. ER, trans-Golgi, or lysosomes are the likely origin of virally induced membranes. deNV2 nonstructural protein 2 (NS2A) contains five integral transmembrane segments. NS2A involves both DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly/maturation. also, DENV infection induces ROCK-dependent vimentin rearrangement and subsequent ER redistribution. HA rapidly associates with calnexin in a monoglucosylated form. the HA monomers dissociate from calnexin and assemble into trimeric structures in the ER or in the intermediate compartment. coexpression of both envelope glycoproteins has been shown to be necessary to produce infectious pseudoparticles. 2B proteins of picornaviruses also participate in the remodeling of membrane structures and the formation of replication complexes. the viral capsid protein, VP7, re-envelopes the immature particle (DLP) after removal of the ER membrane and NSP4 and forms the infectious triple-layered particle. replication of DENV and hepatitis C virus may take place on perinuclear ER membranes. NS2A involves both DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly/maturation. NS4B is responsible for rearranging the ER membrane. hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that determines viral antigenicity. HA monomers dissociate from calnexin and assemble into trimeric structures in the ER or in the intermediate compartment. coexpression of both envelope glycoproteins has been shown to be necessary to produce infectious pseudoparticles. rotavirus-encoded NSP4 modifies the calcium homeostasis by enhancing the calcium permeability of the ER membrane. this may be associated with virus-induced cell death and subsequent release of NSP4, which in turn causes activation of the phospholipase C-IP3 cascade in neighboring noninfected cells. 2A and 3C proteases target translation factors such as eIF4GI and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to impede host translation. modulation of the integrated stress response (ISR) is another strategy for promoting virulence. four eIF2 kinases have been identified. eIF2 phosphorylation plays a role in hampering viral protein synthesis. the induction of activated PERK only correlates with eIF2 phosphorylation at the later stage of infection. eIF2 phosphorylation is inhibiting viral protein synthesis. phosphorylation of eIF2 is required for activation of IRES during cell differentiation. some viruses regulate the eIF2 pathway by interfering with the activation of eIF2 kinases. influenza virus nonstructural protein NS1 interferes with dsRNA binding to PKR. infection also activates P58IPK, a cellular inhibitor of PKR and PERK. apoptotic cell death is considered to be a host strategy for fighting against viral infections. virus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) upregulates eIF2\u2013ATF4\u2013CHOP signaling in infected cells and relies on PERK or PKR activation. eIF2\u2013ATF4\u2013CHOP signaling reduces IBV-induced apoptosis through activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) knockdown of CHOP increases HCV PAMP-mediated innate immune activation. nuclear translocation of p50ATF6, as a transcription factor, activates expression of ER stress and ERAD genes including ER chaperones, CHOP (aka GADD153), EDEM1 and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) by targeting the cis-acting ER stress response element (ERSE) and UPR element (UPRE) NS4A and NS4B, potent inducers of the UPR, inhibit IFN-induced Jak\u2013STAT signaling in an ATF6-dependent manner. other flavivirus infections, including HCV, JEV, and deNV2, also induce cleavage of ATF6. Knockdown of ERp57 abrogates viral progeny production. however, ATF6 activity is not induced in infected human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells. many RNA viruses activate the UPR pathway by cleaving ATF6. endoribonuclease activity initiates an unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, excising a 26-nt sequence. XBP1(S) then translocates to the nucleus where it induces expression of target genes containing UPRE or ERSE. these target genes are involved in ERAD, chaperone protein production and ER membrane biosynthesis. the IRE1 signaling pathway also participates in viral protein retrotranslocation. hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein which is cotranslationally translocated into the ER while a significant fraction of it is also observed in the cytoplasm. studies demonstrated that Ire1 activates RIDD to promote the degradation of mRNAs encoding ER-targeted proteins to reduce the load of ER client proteins during ER stress. the mammalian IRE1\u2013TRAF2\u2013JNK pathway, independent of XBP1 splicing, may lead to the activation of apoptosis after prolonged ER stress. IRE1\u2013TRAF2 pathway is implicated in JNK activation. the role of this pathway is emphasized by DENV2 infection. silencing of IRE1 decreases the virus titer, but the viral progeny output is not affected by silencing of XBP1. RIDD has been suggested to play adaptive roles by reducing protein translocation load, such as decrease of proinsulin expression in pancreatic beta-cells faced with chronic high glucose. RIDD also suggested to play destructive roles under unmitigated ER stress because continued degradation of mRNAs encoding secretory cargo proteins and proteins involved in ER-resident protein folding occurs. in enteroviruses, 2A and 3C proteases target translation factors such as eIF4GI and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to impede host translation. modulation of the integrated stress response (ISR) is another strategy for promoting virulence. eIF2 phosphorylation plays a role in hampering viral protein synthesis. the induction of activated PERK only correlates with eIF2 phosphorylation at the later stage of infection. eIF2 phosphorylation is inhibiting viral protein synthesis. phosphorylation of eIF2 is required for activation of IRES during cell differentiation. some viruses regulate the eIF2 pathway by interfering with the activation of eIF2 kinases. influenza virus nonstructural protein NS1 interferes with dsRNA binding to PKR. infection also activates P58IPK, a cellular inhibitor of PKR and PERK. apoptotic cell death is considered to be a host strategy for fighting against viral infections. Knockdown of CHOP reduces IBV-induced apoptosis through activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) it suggests that upregulation of CHOP-mediated apoptosis during IBV infection probably promotes virus replication. however, upstream CHOP induction is a matter of debate. nuclear translocation of p50ATF6, as a transcription factor, activates expression of ER stress and ERAD genes including ER chaperones, CHOP (aka GADD153), EDEM1 and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1). cleavage and degradation of GRP78/BiP leads to activation of the AKT\u2013NF-B pathway through ATF6 activation. NS4A and NS4B, potent inducers of the UPR, inhibit IFN-induced Jak\u2013STAT signaling in an ATF6-dependent manner. other flavivirus infections, including HCV, JEV, and deNV2, also induce cleavage of ATF6, nuclear translocalization of ATF6. many RNA viruses activate the UPR pathway by cleaving ATF6 to release the p50 fragment. the p50 fragment was not detected in the EV71 infection. endoribonuclease activity initiates an unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, excising a 26-nt sequence. XBP1(S) then translocates to the nucleus where it induces expression of target genes containing UPRE or ERSE. these target genes are involved in ERAD, chaperone protein production, and ER membrane biosynthesis. the IRE1 signaling pathway also participates in viral protein retrotranslocation. hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein which is cotranslationally translocated into the ER. IRE1\u2013TRAF2\u2013JNK pathway, independent of XBP1 splicing, may lead to the activation of apoptosis after prolonged ER stress. overexpression of ORF2 of HEV can upregulate antiapoptotic protein Hsp72 to activate XBP1 via Hsp72. the role of this pathway is emphasized by DENV2 infection. silencing of IRE1 decreases the virus titer, but the viral progeny output is not affected by silencing of XBP1. EV71 phosphorylates IRE1, but inhibits the expression of XBP1. RIDD has been suggested to play destructive roles under unmitigated ER stress because continued degradation of mRNAs encoding secretory cargo proteins and proteins involved in ER-resident protein folding occurs. the addition of IRE1\u2013XBP1 activation decreases the Tg-induced Xbp1 splicing and potential RIDD target transcripts. mTORC1 is a serine/threonine kinase complex, which phosphorylates ULK1 and Atg13 and also inhibits autophagy. Akt and AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylate TSC2 at different residues, which results in the GTP hydrolysis of Rheb. cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) is cleaved by the cysteine protease Atg4, followed by conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which functions as an E3\u2013like enzyme. autophagosome formation is related to UVRAG and expression of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp-2). the exploitation of autophagy has been identified in many RNA viruses including PV, CVB3, and JEV. increased amounts of autophagosomes, as well as colocalization of the autophagy marker protein LC3 and viral protein, were observed in virus-infected cells. an increase in the number of double-membraned autophagy-like vesicles was observed upon infection. however, the accumulation of autophagy substrate p62 and the formation of large autophagy-related structures indicate that CVB3 blocks a later stage of the autophagic pathway. further results highlight the impact of autophagy on CVB3 RNA replication and translation. virus infection induces aggregates of MAVS and activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), markers for activation of innate immune responses. this suggests that autophagy-mediated immune responses are required for viral replication. increased viral infectivity by blocking autophagic flux Virus-induced uncompleted autophagy was reported for CVB3-, rotavirus-, and IVA- infected cells. the accumulation of autophagy substrate p62 and the formation of large autophagy-related structures indicate that CVB3 blocks a later stage of the autophagic pathway. autophagy-mediated immune responses benefit virus replication have been reported in VSV, HCV, DENV, and JEV. authors: virus infection induces aggregates of MAVS and activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), markers for activation of innate immune responses, which suggests that autophagy-mediated immune responses are required for viral replication. authors: ER proliferation is observed both in UPR and autophagy. inhibition of autophagy resulted in enhanced Myc-dependent apoptosis. IRE1 also mediates autophagy in Huntington's disease under ER stress. SREBP-2 activates autophagy gene expression, such as LC3B, ATG4B, and ATG4D, accompanied by increased LC3 puncta formation, while SREBP-2 deficiency obtains an opposite result. further efforts to decipher how HCV activates autophagy revealed. PERK\u2013eIF2\u2013ATF4 and ATF6 pathways activated CHOP expression in HCV core protein-transfected cells where the core protein had not been demonstrated to induce ER stress previously. inhibitors/Inducers Mode-of-action References UPR GRP78/BiP inducer X (BIX) GRP78 upregulation Kudo et al., 2008 Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) Reduces UPR Ozcan et al. yl-silybin Impairs autophagy Dai et al., 2013 There are other established strategies to inhibit viruses by modulating UPR target eIF2 phosphorylation or IRE1, e.g., salubrinal is a small molecule that prevents dephosphorylation of eIF2 and 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde, an IRE1 inhibitor, may cause restriction of IVA. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
