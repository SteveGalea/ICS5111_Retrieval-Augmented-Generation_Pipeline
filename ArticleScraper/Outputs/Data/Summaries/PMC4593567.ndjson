{"summary": "influenza viruses are the oldest and most important examples of viruses that recognize sialic acids as the surface receptor for entry into host cells. avian flu virus strains preferentially bind to sialic acids linked to galactose through an 2\u20133 bond. human flu virus strains preferentially attach to sialic acids linked to galactose through an 2\u20136 bond. chromosome 8 encodes the Sia2-3Gal1- receptor. three SNPs (rs939024, rs2978041 and rs2945733) have so far been identified in codifying regions related to bipolar disorders. ST3GAL1 gene variants may be related to a higher or lower expression of the receptor on the surface of pneumocytes. this interferes with the capacity of infection of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm nephropathy or hemoglobinopathies did not differ significantly between groups. however, the absence of comorbidities was a protective factor in the sample. 72% of subjects who did not require hospitalization had no associated diseases. significant differences in European and African genetic contributions were observed between groups (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively) there was a higher European genetic contribution among non-hospitalized patients and a higher African genetic contribution among patients who died. substitution of guanine (G) for adenine (A) in rs113350588 promotes a change in an exonic splicing enhancer site. the substitution of cytosine (C) for thymine (T) in rs1048479 activates a cryptic acceptor site, with the presence of one or more cryptic branch points. these polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (D\u2019 = s1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function. a higher frequency of the GC and AT haplotypes was observed in patients who died compared to patients who were not hospitalized (7.0% and 6.4%) and hospitalized patients who survived (4.1% and 8.1%).

Association of haplotypes of the ST3GAL1 gene with the risk of more severe disease or death in patients infected with Influenza A(H1 the mean age of hospitalized patients was 22 years and the mean age of patients who died was 30 years. in epidemics caused by seasonal strains 90% of deaths occur in individuals older than 65 years. the mean age at death caused by the strain is also lower than that observed in the influenza epidemics that occurred in 1957 and 1968. the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms of the ST3GAL1 gene were predicted to play a role in the regulation and processing of transcription of this gene, influencing the availability of functional protein in the cell. the presence of these haplotype variants should influence the expression or structure of the sia2-3Gal1- receptors in cells of the lower respiratory tract. all patients who agreed to the blood collection signed a free informed consent form. all informed consent forms were filed at federal university of Par\u00e1. 201 blood and nasal aspirate samples were collected from subjects of both genders and all age groups. the sequences were aligned at a similarity of at least 70% with 10 times refinement using the Geneious 5.5.6\u00ae software. the rs113350588 SNP in exon 4 and the rs1048479 SNP in exon 8 were detected in the sample studied, with minor allele frequencies of 50% and 40.4% respectively. lic discrimination of the polymorphisms was performed in all samples by real-time PCR using the C_2771724_10 assay (rs1048479) and a custom assay (rs113350588) of the TaqMan\u00ae system (Applied Biosystems\u00ae) according to manufacturer instructions. proportions of African, European and Native American genetic ancestry in the 356 patients included in the second phase of the study were estimated using a panel of 48 ancestry patients who agreed to the blood collection signed a free informed consent form. all informed consent forms were filed at federal university of Par\u00e1. 201 blood and nasal aspirate samples were collected from subjects of both genders and all age groups. the sequences were aligned at a similarity of at least 70% with 10 times refinement using the Geneious 5.5.6\u00ae software. the rs113350588 SNP in exon 4 and the rs1048479 SNP in exon 8 were detected in the sample studied. isms was performed in all samples by real-time PCR using the C_2771724_10 assay (rs1048479) and a custom assay (rs113350588) of the TaqMan\u00ae system (Applied Biosystems\u00ae) according to manufacturer instructions. proportions of African, European and Native American genetic ancestry in the 356 patients included in the second phase of the study were estimated using a panel of 48 ancestry informative markers. bA total of 35 cycles were performed for reactions with exception of exon 8. cAnneling: 65\u00b0C 2 cycles; 64\u00b0C 10 cycles; 62\u00b0C 10 cycles, and 60\u00b0C 15 cycles."}
