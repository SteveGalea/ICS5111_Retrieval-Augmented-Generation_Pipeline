{"summary": "the antileishmanial activity of 3,5,7,3\u2019,4\u2019-pentahydroxyflavonol derivatives is partly attributed to the position and pKa of phenolic or catechol hydroxyl groups. the structural features of quercetin and its derivatives were improved by acylation or alkylation of hydroxyl groups. leishmaniasis is a widespread, infectious parasitic disease caused by leishmania spp. in both visceral and cutaneous manifestations. about 350 million people are at risk of infection with leishmania parasites. over 12 million people are infected with different species of the parasite. the aim of this research is to improve quercetin leishmanicidal effects by acylation of hydroxyl group or regioselective 7-O-substitution of electron-donating or electron capture groups. the reaction mixtures were purified using polyamide SC6 column and hexane: acetone as solvent with increasing polarity. d, 1H, J = 8.5 Hz, H-5\u2019), 7.27 (d, 1H, J = 2.2 Hz, H-6), and 2.43 (s, 15H, 5 acetate);13 C-NMR (DMSO-D6) : 169.3, 168.7, 168.3, 168.3, 168.2, 168.0, 167.8, 156.3, 154.35, 153.4, 149.5, 144.42, 142.14 1H-NMR (DMSO-D6) : 7.94 (dd, 1H, J = 1.6 Hz, J = 8.4 Hz, H-6\u2019), 7.90 (d, 1H, J = 1.7 Hz, H-2\u2019), 7.02 (d, 1H, J = 2.6 Hz, H-8), 6.74 (d, 1H, J = 2.1 Hz, H-8), 2.44 (s, 3H, acetate), 2.40 (s, 3 general procedure for preparation of 4a\u20134b K2CO3 and appropriate benzyl chloride were added to a solution of 3 (200 mg, 0.23 mmol) in acetone (15 mL) the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature and then filtered. the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to offer the desired compounds 5\u20136. 7.00 (d, 1H, J = 8.4 Hz, H-6\u2019), 6.9 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, H-8), 6.56 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6), and 5.51 (s, 2H, 4-nitrobenzyl-CH2) promastigotes were seeded in 96-well plates with fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) they maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 25\u00b0C. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis was done on a Bruker AV400 spectrometer using DMSO-D6 as solvent at 400 MHz for 1H-NMR and 100 MHz for 13C-NMR. the IR spectrum was recorded on a Rayleigh WQF-510 FTIR spectrophotometer. a solution of quercetin-3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-pentaacetate (1.0 g, 2.13 mmol) in anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (30 mL), imidazole (50 mg, 0.74 mmol) and thiophenol (0.22 mL, 2.13 mmol) were added. the organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. 44 (s, 3H, acetate), 2.43 (s, 3H, acetate), 2.40 (s, 3H, acetate), and 2.39 (s, 3H, acetate);13 C-NMR (m/z): 481 [M-H] the solution of crude compound 4a\u20134b in NH3/MeOH (10 mL) was stirred for 3 h at room temperature and then filtered. the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature and then filtered. the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to offer the crude product 5\u20136 for the next step directly without further purification. .9, 147.4, 147.1, 145.05, 144.05, 136.06, 128.3, 128.3, 123.7, 123.7, 123.5, 121.75, 119.98, 115.56, 115.2, 104.3, 97.97, 92.85, 68.58, 39.84, 39.63, 39.4, 39.2, and 39; IR (m/z); max: 3404, 2922, 1655 promastigotes were seeded in 96-well plates (5.6 106 parasites/well) with fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and serially diluted concentrations of compounds 1\u20136 (1, 10, 100 M), blank (wells without parasites), negative controls. survived parasites were identified and counted. Compound 3 was arylated with 4-methylbenzyl chloride and 4-nitrobenzyl chloride, separately. deacetylated by treatment with ammonia (2M) in acetone at 0\u00b0C for 5 min. excess ammonia neutralized by adding HCl (0.5 M) quercetin (1) was acetylated by acetic anhydride in pyridine at 180\u00b0C for 6 h (85%) after purification, it yielded quercetin-2,5,3\u2019,4\u2019-tetraacetate (3) with free hydroxyl group on C-7 (60%) and quercetin-2,5,3\u2032\u2032-triacetate (4) with free hydroxyl groups on C-7 (60%). Quercetin derivatives were tested to determine their leishmanicidal activity after 48 h of treatment. they showed a dose-dependent effect on L. major promastigote growth. they showed a dose-dependent effect on L. major promastigote growth. 5-OH, 3-OH, and ortho 3' and 4'-dihydroxyl groups in ring B are involved in leishmanicidal activity in quercetin derivatives. compound 6 showed more antileishmanial activity probably because of increased chelating activity of 5-hydroxy and 4-oxo in A ring, and also more parasite membrane penetration. promastigotes with iron-chelating compounds such as deferoxamine (DFO), L1 and 1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP94) in a dose-dependent manner suppressed parasite growth. quercetin analogs with protected chelating groups (compounds 2, 3, and 4) and those with iron-chelating activity (compounds 1, 5, and 6) both inhibit L. major growth in vitro. quercetin analogs with more lipophilic and iron-chelating activity showed more antiparasite activity. quercetin analogs with more lipophilic and iron-chelating activity showed more antiparasite activity. conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest."}
