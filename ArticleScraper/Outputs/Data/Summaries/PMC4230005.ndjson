{"summary": "many methods have been proposed for the homology analysis of protein sequences. graphical representation methods were introduced for representation of DNA sequences on the basis of multiple dimension space [4\u20137] graphical representation methods were proposed as an alternative approach of direct comparison of sequence invariants. El-Lakkani and El-Sherif [31] proposed a graphical representation of protein sequence to help similarity analysis of protein sequences based on 2D and 3D amino acid adjacency matrices. main drawbacks are that the lines will cross each other, which will decrease the visibility of the graphics. a novel graphical representation of protein sequences called ADLD (Alignment Diagonal Line Diagram) is introduced based on PCA. then a new ADLD based method is proposed and utilized to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of both the 16 different ND5 proteins and the 29 different spike proteins. the analysis results show that our method is not only visual, intuitional, and effective in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences but also quite simple. the names and symbols of the 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 major properties are illustrated in Table 1. the names and symbols of the 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 major properties are illustrated in Table 1. principal components analysis (PCA) is a common technique for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition in datasets of high dimension [41] the main purposes of PCA are the analysis of data to identify patterns and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset with minimal loss of information. X = X 1 X 2 X m = x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n. construct the corresponding m n standardized matrix X * according to the following formula. r i j = k = 1 m ( x k i - x - i ) 2 k = 1 m ( x k i - x - i ) 2 for i 1,2,..., n and j 1,2,..., n. n eigenvectors a 1 = a 11 a 21 a n 1, a 2 = a 12 a 22 a n 2, i k = 1 n k, (6) ACR i = k = 1 i CR k. (7) In order to lower the computation complexity, we can keep only the first t (t n) principal components F 1, F 2,..., F t, where the accumulated contribution rate of the tth principal component F t shall satisfy the fact that ACRt 85%. the accumulative contribution rate of the first 4 principal components amounts to 0.8588 (=85.88%), which is already bigger than 85%. we can obtain the first 4 principal components as follows: F 1 = 0.5036 X 1 0.2454 X 2. there are three big coefficients in the first formula, which are 0.5036 (corresponding to mW), 0.4377 (corresponding to F), and 0.4349 (corresponding to vR), respectively. the three properties such as pI, S, and vR will have a major role in the first principal component F 1. cN will have a major role in the second principal component F 2, the third principal component F 3 is mainly determined by pK1 and S. the fourth principal component F 4 is closely linked with hI and pK2 and so forth. we can obtain the total scores of the 20 amino acids. step 1 translates the protein sequence pair (s 1, s 2) into two numerical sequences with the same length as follows: S 1 = t 1, t 2,..., t N 1, S 2 = t 1, t 2,..., t N 2, 0,0,..., 0 N 1. let w be the alignment width (AW) of the protein sequence pair (s 1, s 2); that is, let s 1 = p 1, p 2, p 3,..., p N1, s 2 = q 1, q 2, q 3,..., q N2; then, for any amino acid p i in the protein sequence s 1, we will compare it with these 2w + 1 amino acids q iw,..., q i1, q i1, for the N 1 N 1 elements in the alignment matrix AM, we can plot points on i-j plane for these elements in the AM with A ij = 1 and |i j | w. we call the obtained graph the Alignment Scatter Diagram (ASD) of the protein sequence pair (s 1, s 2). for a given CAPS caps1, if there is no CAPS caps2 satisfying caps1 caps2, then we call the caps1 a maximum CAPS. for convenience, we call the line formed by connecting all of the APs in a maximum CAPS a similar fragment (SF) and simultaneously we call all of the APs on the AT but not on any SFs the free points (FPs) FP1, FP2,..., FPK2 to represent these K 1 SFs and K 2 FPs separately. for each BTl, where l 1,2,..., K, suppose that there are K 3 different SFs on the BTl. for each BTl, where l 1,2,..., K, we will number these K 3 SFs from left to right and use BSFl 1, BSFl 2,..., BSFl K3 to represent these SFs separately there are totally 6 FPs in the ADLD, which are FP1(46,46), FP2(66,66), FP3(111,111), FP4(114,114), FP5(115,115), and FP6(123,123), respectively. the two SFs in Figure 2(b) are both ASFs; one is ASF1, that is, the line segment from the point (1,1) to the point (104,104), and the other is A the ADLD of any given protein sequence pair obtained by our above proposed method reflects some inner and specific differences between these two protein sequences. 2.1. Procedure of our method for analyzing protein sequences. select the same 9 different properties for each amino acid and construct a 20 9 matrix as the input data of the PCA algorithm on the basis of total 20 different amino acids. the names and symbols of the 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 major properties are illustrated in Table 1. The full list of 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 different properties are illustrated in Table 1. The full list of 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 major properties are illustrated in Table 1. The full list of 20 amino acids and the value of their 9 major properties are illustrated in Table 1. principal components analysis (PCA) is a common technique for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition in datasets of high dimension. the main purposes of PCA are the analysis of data to identify patterns and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset with minimal loss of information. x i * = (x i1 *, x i2 *,..., x in *), x i j = x i j - x - j / var ( x j ), x - j = 1 n x i j, and var ( x j ) = 1 / n - 1 i = 1 n ( x i j - x n eigenvectors 1 2 n > 0 and the corresponding n eigenvectors a 1 = a 11 a 21 a n 1, a 2 = a 12 a 22 a n 2,..., a n = a 1 n a 2 n a n n, (4) respectively. for each principal component F i for i 1,2,..., n, obtain its contribution rate CRi and accumulated PCA of the Amino Acids Observing Table 1, if we consider the 20 amino acids as 20 different samples and the 9 properties of each amino acid as its 9 components, then, according to the general steps of conducting PCA illustrated in Section 2.3, we can obtain a 20 9 matrix X and its standardized matrix X *, a 9 9 correlation matrix R, and 9 principal components F 1, F 2,..., F 9. the 4 eigenvectors a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4 corresponding to the 4 eigenvalues 1, 2, 3, 4 separately. a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 0.5036 0.1436 0.0571 0.2158 0.2454 0.1875 0.2304 0.6547 0.1634 0.1820 0.6298 0.2288 0.3101 0.1883 0.3964 0.5071 0.0702 0.6464 0.0786 0.0532 0.1665 0. 0.2304 X 2 + 0.6298 X 3 + 0.3964 X 4 + 0.0786 X 5 0.5280 X 6 + 0.1003 X 7 + 0.2544 X 9.

Step 3. \u2014 Let > 0 be the dissimilarity degree (DD) of two amino acids; otherwise, it means that the two amino acids are the same. we illustrate the ASDs of the -globin protein sequence pair (chimpanzee, human) and the -globin protein sequence pair (human, gorilla) separately while letting = 0. Figure 1. in order to improve the intuition of the ASD, we will propose a simplified variant diagram of the ASD. if = 1, then an ADLD will degenerate into an ASD. in actual applications, we suggest that will be no less than 2. for each BTl, where l 1,2,..., BTK to represent these BTs separately. in Figure 2, we show the two ADLDs corresponding to the ASDs. in Figure 2, we use the red \u201c\u201d to represent the FPs on the AT and blue lines to represent the SFs on the AT or BTs. the two ASFs in Figure 2(b) are separated by one gap, and there will be no FPs or BSFs on the AT or BTs. if there exist some deletions or insertions of amino acid segments, then, in their ADLD, there will exist some gaps between two neighboring SFs or FPs on the AT. step 1. transform these N protein sequences into N numerical sequences S 1, S 2,..., S N. step 2. Suppose that there are totally L 1 different ASFs such as ASF1, ASF2,..., ASFL1, L 2 different BSFs such as BSFl1 1, BSFl2 2,..., BSFlL2 L2 and L 3 different FPs in the ADLD. according to these N protein sequences 1, 2,..., N, we can obtain an N N matching matrix (MM) as follows: MM = d i j N, (18) where d i j = SD i, j, if i j, 0, else, for i 1,2,..., N, j 1,2,..., N. based on the matching matrix MM and all of its components d ij, where i 1,2,..., N and j 1, Pigmy chimpanzee Pi-chim NP_008209 603 4 Common chimpanzee C-chim NP_008196 603 5 Fin-whale Fin-whale Fin-whale NP_006899 606 6 Blue-whale Blue-whale NP_007066 606 7 Rat Rat AP_004902.1 610 8 Mouse Mouse NP_904338 607 9 Opossum Opossum NP_00 0.4418 0.4515 0.4519 0.4513 0.4479 0.0000 Sheep 0.3020 0.2933 0.2871 0.2951 0.2023 0.2023 0.2067 0.3149 0.3219 0.4121 0.0000 Goat 0.3036 0.2901 0.2871 0.2919 0.1958 0.2147 0.3166 0.3468 0.0712 0.0000 Lemur 0.2989 0.2708 0.2839 0.2967 0.2557 0.2724 0.3166 0.3670 0. the shortest distance between opossum and the remaining mammals is 0.4423. the result is consistent with the fact that gallus is not a kind of mammal. the results illustrated in Table 6 are wholly consistent with the results of the known fact of evolution. to further validate the performance of our ADLDs based method, we applied our method to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of another group of proteins. we compared our method with the method proposed by Wen and Zhang [17] based on the above given 16 ND5 proteins and the following 29 spike proteins, respectively. the phylogenetic tree of the 29 spike proteins of coronavirus is constructed by adopting the ADLDs based method with = 5. the spike protein sequences are very long (with more than 1100 amino acids), therefore, during simulation, we set = 5 to avoid the effect of noise points. the phylogenetic tree of the 29 spike proteins of coronavirus constructed by adopting the method proposed by Wen and Zhang [17], in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Figure 5. The phylogenetic tree of the 29 spike proteins of coronavirus constructed by adopting the method proposed by Wen and Zhang. observing Figure 7, we can clearly find that the total length of all of the SFs in each of these three ADLDs satisfies the total length of all of the SFs in the ADLD of Figure 7(a) we can also identify that the two protein sequences in either the protein sequence pair (human, opossum) or the protein sequence pair (human, gallus) are apparently dissimilar to each other. the total lengths of all of the SFs in the ADLDs of Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are 123 and 120, respectively, and are really close to each other. but, through comparing Figure 2(a) with Figure 2(b), we can further discover that, different from Figure 2(b), except for the SFs, there are also 6 different FPs in the ADLD of Figure 2(b) step 2. Suppose that there are totally L 1 different ASFs such as ASF1, ASF2,..., ASFL1, L 2 different BSFs such as BSFl1 1, BSFl2 2,..., BSFlL2 L2 and L 3 different FPs such as FP1, FP2,..., FPL3 in the ADLD. MM = d i j N, (18) where d i j = SD i, j, if i j, 0, else, for i 1,2,..., N, j 1,2,..., N. we can obtain an N N similarity/dissimilarity matrix (SM) of these N protein sequences 1, 2,..., N as follows. panzee Pi-chim NP_008209 603 5 Common chimpanzee C-chim NP_008196 603 5 Fin-whale Fin-whale Fin-whale NP_006899 606 6 Blue-whale Blue-whale NP_007066 606 7 Rat Rat AP_004902.1 610 8 Mouse Mouse NP_904338 607 9 Opossum Opossum NP_007105 602 opossum seems to be a peculiar mammal, since the shortest distance between it and the remaining mammals is more than 0.4023. shortest distance between it and the remaining mammals is more than 0.4023. the shortest distance between opossum and the remaining mammals is 0.4423. the result is consistent with the fact that gallus is not a kind of mammal. the results illustrated in Table 6 are wholly consistent with the results of the known fact of evolution. we applied our method to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of another group of proteins including 29 spike proteins of coronavirus. we compared our method with the method proposed by Wen and Zhang [17] based on the above given 16 ND5 proteins and the following 29 spike proteins. the phylogenetic tree of the 29 spike proteins of coronavirus is constructed by adopting the ADLDs based method with = 5. the group I includes the canine coronavirus (CCoV), the Feline coronavirus (FCoV), the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). phylogenetic tree of the 29 spike proteins of coronavirus constructed by adopting the method proposed by Wen and Zhang. it is obvious that the phylogenetic trees obtained by our ADLDs based method are quite unreasonable and not consistent with the known facts of evolution. therefore, there is no doubt that the performance of our method is much better than that of the method proposed by Wen and Zhang. observing Figure 7, we can clearly find that the total length of all of the SFs in each of these three ADLDs satisfies the total length of all of the SFs in the ADLD of Figure 7(a) the total length of all of the SFs in each of these three ADLDs satisfies the total length of all of the SFs in the ADLD of Figure 7(b) the total lengths of all of the SFs in the ADLDs of Figure 2(a) and 2(b) are 123 and 120, respectively, and are really close to each other. but, through statistic, we can further discover that, different from Figure 2(b), except for the SFs, there are also 6 different FPs in the ADLD of Figure 2(a) the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
