{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae infections account for 20 to 40% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases in certain populations (1, 2). Infections may occur in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in some cases can lead to extrapulmonary manifestations without obvious respiratory disease. nasopharyngeal (NP) and/or oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimens were obtained from the students identified as probable pneumonia cases or presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms. one follow-up swab was collected approximately 5 weeks after the initial swab was documented as a laboratory-confirmed M. pneumoniae case. l specimen TNA was combined with 50 l of 1 qScript XLT one-step reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR ToughMix, Low ROX (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) for the reaction mixture. a no-template control (NTC) and a positive control consisting of combined RNA transcripts were included on each TAC along with up to six patient specimens. qPCR assay was used as the primary testing modality following etiological identification because of its proven reliability and validation and its compliance with clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) standards. no blind passages were performed for all qPCR-positive swab specimens (n = 12), as previously discussed (5). all isolates were tested in triplicate on the Rotor-Gene Q 6000 system (Qiagen) all isolates were classified based on comparison of melting profiles to the type 1 reference strain (M129) and the type 2 reference strain (FH). MLVA typing was carried out using extracted nucleic acid from the 12 primary specimens and the 10 isolates. total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from 200 l of UTM from each swab specimen and eluted into 100 l using a MagNA Pure compact total nucleic acid isolation kit. all patient specimens and a single follow-up swab specimen (n = 22) were tested using the TAC. multiplex qPCR assay was used to test the specimens (n = 22) in triplicate reactions for the presence of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Legionella spp., as previously described (9). qPCR assay was used as primary testing modality following etiological identification because of its proven reliability and validation. PCR was run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. macrolide sensitivity profiles were generated for 12 M. pneumoniae-positive primary specimens and 10 isolates using real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis. all specimens and corresponding isolates were tested in triplicate on the Rotor-Gene-Q 6000 system (Qiagen) MLVA types were further evaluated using the four-loci typing scheme. eighty-three cases of probable pneumonia were identified between September and December 2012. patients reported symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, body aches, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, and/or rash. the CT value differences between the TAC and multiplex qPCR ranged from 1 cycle to 3 cycles. the other respiratory pathogens identified in the patient specimens included H. influenzae (n = 11), S. pneumoniae (n = 4), S. pyogenes (n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 2), adenovirus (n = 1), coronavirus type 3 (identified in the follow-up swab specimen) and influenza A virus (n = MLVA was performed on all M. pneumoniae-positive primary specimens (n = 12) and recovered isolates (n = 10). analysis of the combination of tandem repeats at the five VNTR loci revealed seven distinct MLVA types in the original specimens. no novel MLVA types were identified. eighty-three cases of probable pneumonia were identified between September and December 2012. patients reported symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, body aches, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, and/or rash. NP and/or OP swab specimens were obtained from 19 probable pneumonia cases. the CT value differences between the TAC and multiplex qPCR ranged from 1 cycle to 3 cycles. the other respiratory pathogens identified in the patient specimens included H. influenzae (n = 11), S. pneumoniae (n = 4), S. pyogenes (n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 2), adenovirus (n = 1), coronavirus type 3 (identified in the follow-up swab specimen) MLVA was performed on all M. pneumoniae-positive primary specimens (n = 12) and recovered isolates (n = 10). analysis of tandem repeats at the five VNTR loci revealed seven distinct MLVA types in the original specimens. no novel MLVA types were identified. two diagnostic strategies, the TAC and multiplex qPCR, were used for identification. the TAC is useful for outbreaks in which the etiology is initially unknown. the mere presence of a microorganism does not necessarily equate to the etiology of the illness. specimen collection began almost 2 months after the first case was identified. this delay resulted in a limited number of specimens available for the laboratory confirmation of an M. pneumoniae infection. most students seeking medical attention were prescribed azithromycin or doxycycline for the empirical treatment of bacterial respiratory infection. pneumoniae can be classified into one of two main genomic groups (type 1 and type 2) based on sequence variation within the gene encoding the major adhesion molecule P1. heterogeneity in circulating P1 types has been reported in two of eight documented M. pneumoniae outbreak investigations in the united states since 1995 (14) differentiation was limited to variability of tandem repeats at the Mpn1 locus. lack of stability suggests that Mpn1 is not a good candidate locus for comparison of M. pneumoniae. elimination of Mpn1 from the current analysis reveals only three distinct MLVA types. M. pneumoniae infection can be more appropriately managed and directly addressed for better patient care."}
