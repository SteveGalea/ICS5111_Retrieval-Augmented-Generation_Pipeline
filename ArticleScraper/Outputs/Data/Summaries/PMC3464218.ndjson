{"summary": "the kinetics of infection of different cells in the immune system is not well documented, due to the lack of immune-competent mouse models for dengue disease. the kinetics of infection of different cells in the immune system is not well documented, due to the lack of immune-competent mouse models for dengue disease. DENV accumulates products with conserved molecular structures, like RNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety or double stranded RNA. these foreign molecules are ligands of different cellular receptors engaged in their recognition. PRRs are divided into two different classes depending on their localization, associated with either the membrane or the cytoplasm. adaptor protein named as stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) [13], mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) [14] and endoplasmic reticulum IFN stimulator (ERIS) [15]. the same protein was previously identified as a mediator of anti-major histocompatibility complex II monoclonal antibody-induced apoptosis in B-lymphoma cells [16]. our group has documented that DENV is a weak inducer of type I interferon in human DCs. this lack of type I IFN production by DCs infected with DENV results in an impaired ability of those DCs to prime T cells toward Th1 immunity. this effect is viral dose dependent and takes place as early as 2 hours after DENV infection. we showed that only the recombinant NDV expressing the protease complex NS2B3 inhibited IFN expression in infected DCs. similar results were obtained using an IFN promoter activity assay in 293T cells. NS2B3 mutants showed a diminished inhibition of this phenotype. in the present report, we describe the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production by DENV in primary human and mouse cells. we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the DENV NS2B3 protease complex. this phenomenon impairs the production of type I IFN in defected cells. we have generated a wild type DENV-NS2B3 and a proteolytically inactive version (NS2B3-S135A) by direct mutagenesis [25] that were used to analyze the potential cleavage of STING by the DENV protease complex. in order to test the susceptibility of human and mouse STING proteins to proteolytic cleavage or degradation, we co-expressed a C-terminally HA-tagged STING alongside the human and mouse versions of STING were co-immunoprecipitated with the WT DENV NS2B3 complex and the proteolytically inactive mutant NS2B3 S135A. they mutated the sequence corresponding to the first three amino acids of the human site, RRG (shown in figure 1B as mSTING in red) these recombinant versions of STING were co-transfected into 293T cells with the WT and human factors involved in type I IFN production harbor putative target sequences for cleavage by the DENV NS2B3 protease complex based on Li et al. 2005. asterisk indicates positions which have single, fully conserved residue. HA-tagged NS2B3 and FLAG-tagged human and mouse STING plasmids were transfected in 293T cells. after 48 h, cells lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-FLAG antibody. DENV NS2B3-dependent cleavage of endogenous human STING occurs in cells relevant to DENV infection (MDDCs) cleavage of endogenous human STING inhibits induction of IFN and p55-C1B promoters by human STING. we transfected 293T cells with either hSTING or mSTING. we did not observe any DENV NS2B3-dependent inhibition when the human adaptor TBK1 was used as a positive control to induce the IFN promoter. cleavage of hSTING by the DENV NS2B3 precludes the induction of type I IFN responses. to validate the observed results in human primary cells, we used E. coli DNA, a known inducer of STING signaling [35]. MDDCs were treated with MOCK, DENV and UV inactivated DENV. after 12 hours, the three sets of cells were stimulated with MOCK or purified E. coli DNA. total RNA was purified at 2 and 7 hours post treatment. SFV-NS2B3-WT induced significantly higher expression of TNF at early times post-infection compared to SFV-NS2B3-S135A control. this would suggest an involvement of the NS2B3 protease complex in the expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine [24] recombinant DENV-NS2B3 inhibits type I IFN production in human but not in mouse dendritic cells. human dendritic cells were infected with MOCK, DENV-2 (16681), SFV-NS2B3-WT and SFV- NS2B3-S135A using a MOI = 1. total RNA was extracted at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi. data re representative of three independent experiments from three different donors (A to F) and two individual experiments (G to L). Error bars indicate standard deviation from duplicate samples. we repeated the infection using different DENV serotypes (DENV-2 16681 strain, DENV-3 PR-6 strain and DENV-4 H-241 strain) and an MOI of 1, with similar results. these results are likely due to the inability of DENV to inhibit the type I IFN signaling in mouse cells. twenty-four hours after transduction MEFs were infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 1 (strains 16681 and NGC) or mock treated. levels of IFN, IFN and viral RNA were measured by qRT-PCR after total RNA extraction from the cells at different times post infection. induction of IFN was detected as early as 2 hpi. two versions of recombinant human STING (WT and MUT) and GFP control were expressed in Sting / MEFs using lentiviral vectors (described in materials and methods) after 24 hours, infection by lentivirus was confirmed by GFP expression and MEFs were infected with DENV-2 16681 (A\u2013C) or DENV-2 NGC (D\u2013F) TING-MUT produced higher levels of IFN when compared with STING-WT or GFP controls. the induction of IFN messenger RNA was detected as early as 2 hpi. this is in agreement with the results described with MEFs. a decrease of STING mRNA level was observed when specific siRNAs were used compared to two scrambled control siRNAs. as a consequence, the previously observed upregulation of STING after DENV infection was controlled by the STING siRNAs. deNV titers were determined by plaque assay of the supernatants from infected MDDCs treated with scramble and STING siRNA from six independent donors at 24 hpi. the limit of detection for the plaque assay was 101 PFU (indicated with a dashed line) data for A and B is representative of six independent donors tested in 3 separate experiments. the early time point of 12 hpi was chosen to obtain sufficient numbers of pDCs. these cells have short half-lives and downregulate their specific cell surface markers in a rapid fashion. human primary immune cells from blood fail to produce type I IFN after DENV infection. cytokines present in the supernatants from those infected MDMs were measured by multiplex ELISA: (E) TNF levels, (F) IL-6 levels and (G) IFN levels were measured in the supernatants by multiplex ELISA at the indicated times. dengue virus NS2B3 protease complex inhibits type I IFN production in human primary dendritic cells. this inhibition requires a proteolytically active NS2B3 protease complex [24], [25] in order to identify potential NS2B3 targets we performed a bioinformatic search for potential DENV protease sites. HA-tagged STING alongside a wild type or catalytically active DENV-NS2B3 and a proteolytically inactive version (NS2B3-S135A) in 293T cells. in the presence of WT NS2B3 we observed the full-length 42 kDa human STING and an additional band of about 32 KD. this is consistent with a C-terminal region product of a cleavage occurring within the first 96 the ability of the DENV protease to cleave STING was drastically reduced when the mouse sequence was present in hSTING (Figure 1F, lane 5) these data confirm the requirement for amino acids RRG for efficient cleavage of STING by the DENV NS2B3. however, replacement of the corresponding amino acid sequence of mouse STING (IHCM) by the human putative cleavage sequence (LRRG) does not render mouse STING susceptible to cle DENV NS2B3 protease complex cleaves human STING but not mouse STING. cleavage of human adaptor STING at the N-termini of TM3 (light blue) and cleavage site of DENV NS2B3 (highlighted in red) degradation of endogenous human STING by DENV in primary human DCs analyzed by WB using anti-STING and anti-NS3 antibodies described in materials and methods. we infected human MDDCs with DENV-2 (16681 strain) and analyzed the cell lysates by western blot at different time points. this degradation of STING could be detected at 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) transfected 293T cells with either hSTING (Figures 2A and 2B) or mSTING (Figures 2C and 2D) and the three different versions of the DENV protease: wild type, the proteolytically inactive version (NS2B3-S135A) and the proteolytic core (NS2Bh-NS3pro) alongside luciferase reporter constructs driven by either an IFN promoter (IFN-Luc) or UV inactivated DENV inhibits induction of IFN and p55-C1B promoters by human STING. 293T cells were co-transfected with vector encoding for p55-C1B promoter driving the luciferase gene, a plasmid encoding for human STING and plasmids for different versions of DENV protease. deNV NS2B3 antagonizes type I IFN production in human but not in mouse cells. SFV-NS2B3-WT induced significantly lower levels of IFN/ mRNA than the SFV-NS2B3-S135A control. SFV is an alphavirus that can replicate in mouse cells, and DCs in particular. in this context, the SFV-NS2B3 exhibited a higher induction of both IFN/ genes compared to the SFV-NS2B3-S135A control. qRT-PCR measured expressions of different proteins and viral RNAs. total RNA was extracted at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi. qRT-PCR used 18S and -actin as housekeeping genes. both DENV-2 strains induced significantly higher levels of IFN in WT MEFs compared to the Sting / MEFs. the KO MEFs were more permissive to DENV infection than the WT MEFs. despite the high MOI used, replication of DENV 16681 and NGC was rapidly controlled in WT MEFs. infectious particles released to the supernatants of infected MEFs were measured by plaque assay on BHK cells. data are representative of two independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean of two replicate samples. deNV-NS2B3 is necessary for the inhibition of IFN production in infected cells. infection with the two DENV-2 strains also induced higher levels of IFN mRNA in MEFs expressing STING-MUT than in the MEFs expressing STING-WT and the GFP control. expression of STING-MUT in primary human DCs attenuates DENV replication. lack of STING cleavage was sufficient to increase expression of type I IFN in MEFs infected with DENV. the lack of STING cleavage was sufficient to increase the expression of type I IFN in primary human cells. cleave mutant STING and inhibit the induction of type I IFN. over expression of STING in MDDCs potentiates IFN induction. lentiviruses were transduced with lentiviruses expressing either STING-WT, STING-MUT or GFP. the viral progeny released by those infected MDDCs was quantified by plaque assay, the six donors treated with scramble and STING specific siRNA. when scrambled siRNA was used, only three out of the six donors released detectable viral progeny in the supernatant. deNV-2 RNA was detected in all cells tested including plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), B cells, blood circulating DCs (cDCs), monocytes as well as in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) we also analyzed the cytokine and chemokine expression profile in all those cells by qRT-PCR and multiplex ELISA (Figure 8B) cell supernatants from samples described above were collected to measure cytokine and chemokine levels. PBMCs were infected with DENV-2 (16681) or SFV-NS2B3-WT and SFV-NS2B3-S135A. cytokine and chemokine levels in the supernatants were measured at 18 h post infection by multiplex ELISA. macrophages are efficiently infected with DENV, with an early peak of replication and produce TNF and IL-6 after DENV infection and after SFV expressing the mutant versions of the NS2B3 DENV protease complex. the inhibition of different steps implicated in these molecular pathways has been a matter of extensive study for several years. we identified the human adaptor molecule STING as a protein with a predominant role in the recognition of DENV by the innate immune system. this protein was described to reside in the ER, a cellular organelle intimately related to the DENV replication process. also, STING has been described as part of the TRAP (translocon associated protein) complex that can associate with RIG-I and IPS-1, two proteins with relevant roles in viral detection [41]. induction was only observed for human STING, suggesting that the cleavage confirmed by WB impaired the ability of this adaptor to induce IFN. it could be interesting to investigate the presence of mutations at the cleavage site of STING for DENV NS2B3 in the human population, to identify a natural resistance to DENV infection. in primary human cells as well as in mouse cells, we also found that the presence of human STING allowed for greater DENV replication. recombinant viruses expressing DENV-NS2B3 showed a clear effect on the induction of TNF in human DCs. the inhibition of luciferase activity driven by p55-C1B promoter was considerably more efficient when compared with IFN-promoter. further work exploring the impact that DENV-NS2B3 has on the. induction of NF-k activity in infected cells would confirm a putative role of this viral factor in the modulation of innate immune response by the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. it is becoming increasingly clear that STING is a crucial adaptor in immune cells after infection with different viruses, such as HIV and DENV. all viruses need to limit or inhibit the production of type I IFN in infected cells to avoid the establishment an antiviral state in those cells. infected cells may be disrupted by the DENV NS2B3 targeting of STING. the NS2B3 has not been shown to directly interact with IPS-1. further experiments are required to understand complex interplays. primary human cells implicated in dengue virus infection can support DENV replication. an interesting approach would be the development of a transgenic mouse model with humanized STING and STAT2. this approach could provide an immune competent mouse model for DENV that eliminates two of the potential bottlenecks that exist for DENV replication in mice. cell supernatants were collected, clarified, and stored at 80\u00b0C. the titers of deNV stocks were determined by limiting-dilution plaque assay. the titers of deNV stocks were determined by limiting-dilution plaque assay on BHK cells.
