{"summary": "the current outbreak has been complicated by a novel geographic spread, and the virus\u2019 flourishing in urban environments. the current outbreak has been complicated by a novel geographic spread, and the current outbreak has been complicated by a novel geographic spread. however, familiar themes from past outbreaks carry through to the present day. Developed countries present a frightening, albeit empirically divergent picture of the outbreaks. the infection of two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital illustrated the vulnerability of HCWs to EVD in a resource-rich setting. the author was invited to present at an ad hoc panel on EVD preparedness at the American Society for Nephrology 2014 meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. public health emergencies are immensely and tragically disruptive events. endemic illnesses in a community afflicted by a public health emergency can rage through populations as subepidemics. the EVD outbreak is one such example. the loss of HCWs in these communities is particularly devastating, because there were so few to start. the treatment of patients suffering from EVD at Emory showed the plentiful resources at a medical team\u2019s disposal when dealing with isolated patients. most prominent were debates about a physician\u2019s obligation to treat in the context of HIV/AIDS (12), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (13,14), and pandemic influenza (15). in each case, it was determined that there was a presumption in favor of a duty to treat. the CDC provides guidance on the safe use of acute hemodialysis, including specific methodologies, equipment, PPE, and disposal of waste products (17). the concept for discussions on the duty to treat is the idea of a professional. professions have been defended elsewhere for scientists and warfighters (22) and warfighters (in the \u201cprofession of arms\u201d) (23); physicians are less controversial examples of professions. the clergy is, arguably, the original profession, and although the church\u2019s influence in the context of important social institutions has waned, their position inspired conceptual models of professions. professional and personal duties are not absolute; no single duty of an HCW as a professional is more important than any and all other considerations. these duties can and do conflict with a professional\u2019s special duties. the duty to protect infringes on the right of HCWs as humans to be free from harm. in resource-poor scenarios, individual duties to patients conflict with duties to promote the collective public good that medicine and health care provision supply to a community. in other emergent situations, such as war, the rule of salvage provides a normative basis for assessing conflicts between duties of care and the larger objectives of war. the need to balance the aims of response to a public health crisis with the norms that require HCWs to treat on the basis of need highlights a final concern. a range of interventions exists to reduce the risks to HCWs and the community. nephrologists, professional associations, and the CDC have produced guidance on the appropriate use of PPE should patients present with EVD. nephrologists, professional associations, and the CDC have produced guidance on the appropriate use of PPE should patients present with EVD. nephrologists introduce a new consideration: the allocation of dialyzing devices to patients with EVD. the maximum number of devices that can and should be assigned in the event of an EVD outbreak should be considered. the maximum number of devices that can and should be assigned in the event of an EVD outbreak or other public health emergency should be considered. health care is a public good and in the age of rapid mass transit, an increasingly global public good. as the EVD outbreak wanes, the recent jump of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus from the Middle East to the Republic of South Korea has once again shown how quickly an outbreak can move. being a professional entails duties to one\u2019s fellows."}
