{"summary": "the aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam in eight rabbits. intravenous boluses of 0.1 mL of the mixture were administered every 20 s until the righting reflex was lost. TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression. further evaluation is needed to establish if protocol is useful for rabbits undergoing surgery. continuous total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) has become popular in veterinary anaesthesia. the development of intravenous (IV) anaesthetics with a short half-life has made it possible to control duration and depth of anaesthesia in a manner similar to inhalation anaesthesia. TIVA with either ketamine-xylazine [14] or propofol [15,16] does not provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. sufentanil-midazolam TIVA may be useful in rabbit anaesthesia. results are presented as mean SD or median (range) and n = 8 unless indicated. time to intubation from start of induction was 9 2 min (n = 7) intubation failed in one rabbit and a close fitting mask was used instead. maintenance doses were 0.72 0.15 g/kg BW/h and 0.13 0.03 mg/kg BW/h respectively. n = 6) increased immediately after induction and remained high during most of maintenance. no signs of arrhythmias were observed on the ECG. in medetomidine premedicated NZW rabbits during TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam (mean SD) induction was without excitation, apnoea or muscle rigidity, providing good conditions for endotracheal intubation. rabbits have a narrow oral cavity which makes visual intubation difficult. the difficulty of endotracheal intubation in rabbits has been described in numerous studies [25-27] medetomidine sedation produced satisfactory conditions for placement of vessel catheters. in human anaesthesiology, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists are increasingly used in low doses to improve cardiovascular stability. despite marked respiratory depression, we chose to ventilate the rabbits minimally. a high prevalence of hypotension has been reported in rabbits anaesthetized with e.g. isoflurane, haltothane or ketamine-medetomidine. the pressure measured in the auricular artery has been shown to be approximately 8 mm Hg lower than in the carotid artery. tomidine has been shown to decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure in dogs, but MAP did not fall below 65 mmHg. in humans, sufentanil-midazolam also decreases MAP (75 mm Hg), [46,47] in humans, but MAP did not fall below 65 mmHg. uncorrected hypotension may contribute to high mortality levels in rabbit anaesthesia. a similar BW (2 kg) was found to be accurate in comparison to transpulmonary thermodilution. a peripheral instead of a central vein may be used, which reduces risk for complications. no adverse effects were seen due to the CO measurement. TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits, but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression. the protocol may still be an alternative to inhalation anaesthesia in situations where longer duration anaesthesia is needed and inhalation anaesthesia is not an option. each rabbit was fed 200 mL of pellets daily (Lactamin K1, Lactamin AB) room temperature was 20 2\u00b0C and humidity 55 10%. doses were extrapolated from studies of sufentanil and/or midazolam. ea during TIVA induction before rescue attempts were initiated. rabbits were premedicated SC with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg BW) 30 min before catheterisation. the rabbits were in the animal holding room. the rabbit was breathing 100% oxygen (2 L/min) from a face mask. starting the infusion before bolus administration has been shown to prevent muscle rigidity. the rabbit was left to breathe spontaneously, receiving 67% oxygen in air. acetate solution was administered IV at a rate of 20 mL/kg BW/h. to end anaesthesia, the sufentanil-midazolam infusion was discontinued. times to extubation and return of righting reflex were recorded. in total 7.5 mL of blood was collected per kg BW. a portable analyser was used for immediate analysis of haematocrit, pH, partial pressure of arterial CO2 and O2 (PaO2) in blood. arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of blood gases, lactate, drug concentrations, total protein and glucose every 15 minutes during anaesthesia and 15 min after discontinuation of the TIVA-infusion. Statistical analyses Analysis (Sigma Plot, Systat Software Inc.) over time was performed with one-way ANOVA for repeated measures (continuous data, normally distributed by test of Shapiro-Wilk) all but one rabbit was fed 200 mL of pellets daily (Lactamin K1, Lactamin AB) each rabbit was fed 200 mL of pellets daily (Lactamin K1, Lactamin AB) room temperature was 20 2\u00b0C and humidity 55 10%. one rabbit premedicated with fluanisone-fentanyl died from apnoea during TIVA induction. the rabbits were premedicated SC with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg BW) 30 min before catheterisation. the rabbit was breathing 100% oxygen (2 L/min) from a face mask. starting the infusion before bolus administration has been shown to prevent muscle rigidity. the rabbit was left to breathe spontaneously, receiving 67% oxygen. the rabbits recovered under a heat lamp (24\u201326\u00b0C) before being returned to their home pens. a bolus dose of 5.6 mol/kg BW lithium chloride was injected IV. in total 7.5 mL of blood was collected per kg BW. a portable analyser was used for immediate analysis of haematocrit, pH, partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2) and O2 (PaO2) in blood. arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of blood gases, lactate, drug concentrations, total protein and glucose every 15 minutes during anaesthesia. RR, HR, MAP, CO, SpO2, ETCO2 and BT were recorded every 10 minutes."}
