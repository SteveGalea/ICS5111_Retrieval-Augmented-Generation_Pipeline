{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is highly prevalent in the adult population (1, 2). ZEBRA binds to promoters of viral lytic cycle genes and to the origin of lytic replication. ZEBRA triggers the conversion of EBV from its latent to lytic state by binding to virus-specific heptad DNA sequences. ZEBRA has a modular structure similar to that of other members of the AP-1 transcriptional activator family. a casein kinase 2 regulatory domain located between the transactivation domain and the bZIP domain includes two phosphorylation sites. the rest of the ZEBRA domains are similar to those found in other AP-1 transcription factors. eukaryote HKB5-B5 cells binding to radiolabeled ZIIIB 21-mer. methylation of cytosines at CpG sites in cellular DNA is typically affiliated with silencing of transcription. methylation of cytosines at CpG sites in cellular DNA is typically affiliated with silencing of transcription (21) ZEBRA is involved in recruitment of host cellular factors. the minimal DNA-binding domain includes residues 166 to 245 of ZEBRA. these amino acids span the canonical basic domain homologous to AP-1 and the subsequent dimerization domain. we mixed radiolabeled 21-mer ZpZIIIB with lysates of HKB5-B5 mammalian cells expressing FLAG-tagged ZEBRA constructs. the best DNA binding was observed with Z(155-245), which caused a 30% shift of the radiolabeled ZpZIIIB; full-length ZEBRA shifted 15% of the labeled DNA. binding affinities of different purified ZEBRA proteins with different DNA substratesa ZEBRA construct Binding affinity (nM) for: ZpZIIIB 14-mer RpZRE3 14-mer unmethylated RpZRE3 14-mer methylated site 1 and 2 RpZRE3 11-mer methylated sites 1 and 2 Z(1-245) 140 40 Z(155-245) 140 30, 140 10* 1,500 300 400 100 50 50 10 60 30, 180 40* 150 50 both Z(172-245) and Z(175-245) bound ZpZIIIB and RpZRE3. this result suggests there is a DNA-binding-inhibitory function present in Z(166-172) ZEBRA is unique among transcription factors for its ability to preferentially bind methylated DNA substrates. samples were unmethylated or methylated RpZRE3 20-mer. the letter B marks a background band. first, we tested the binding efficiency of different ZEBRA constructs to RpZRE3-methylated DNA. ITC also allowed us to detect the low RpZRE3-binding affinities of Z(166-245), which binds unmethylated RpZRE3 DNA with a Kd of 9,700 nM and doubly methylated DNA with a slightly enhanced affinity of 1,800 nM. the RRTRK motif is required not only for high-affinity DNA binding but also for the recognition of the methylated state of DNA. truncation preferentially bound to the methylated DNA. ZEBRA exhibits asymmetrical recognition of DNA methylation sites. the additional basic region of ZEBRA is also important for distinguishing between different positions of methylation within the RpZRE3 DNA. methylation at site 2 is sufficient for ZEBRA\u2019s DNA binding. site 1 methylation provides a minor contribution. RRTRK plays a role in selective recognition of one of the two CpG elements asymmetrically positioned within one ZRE. -mer or 21-mer radiolabeled DNA in presence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA truncations. ZEBRA required DNA longer than 12 or 13 nucleotides to bind with high affinity. further increasing the length of the DNA to greater than 15 nucleotides did not enhance ZEBRA\u2019s binding affinity. ZEBRA protein with radiolabeled RpZRE3 site 2-methylated 20-mer with different amounts of cold competitors of RpZRE3 site 2-methylated 20-mer with mutations in the flanking sequence. we compared the difference in binding affinity by ITC for the doubly methylated RpZRE3 DNA between the wild-type Z(155-245) protein and the mutant that lacks the four basic amino acids that putatively interact with the flanking DNA. AATAA mutant to ZpZIIIB 14-mer DNA (A), RpZRE3 14-mer doubly methylated DNA (B), or RpZRE3 unmethylated 14-mer DNA (C) all measurements were completed in triplicate. table 1 provides comparison of the mutant with the wild type. we asked if ZEBRA prefers the flanking region adjacent to the site 1 or site 2 methylation site. the results showed that ZEBRA had similar binding affinity for RpZRE3 DNA with flanking regions on either side of the heptad. RRTRK region is important for attaching ZEBRA onto the DNA. the RRTRK basic residues are more specific for recognition of methylated than unmethylated DNA. the same DNA substrate RpZRE3 without methylation has only 2-fold lower affinity for the AATAA mutant than wild-type ZEBRA. RRTRA, AATRK, and AATAK bound DNA with a modest reduction in DNA affinity. both residues after the threonine (RRTAA) were mutated. binding affinity was reduced by 2.6-fold compared to that of the wild-type protein. mutation of RRTRK basic motif affects lytic cycle activation. mutation of RRTRK basic motif affects lytic cycle activation. late gene expression correlated with a marked defect in inducing lytic viral DNA replication (23) it is known that expression of the BFRF3 and BLRF2 late gene mRNA is dependent on lytic replication (23) the marked defect in DNA-binding affinity (5.5-fold difference) of purified Z(155-245) proteins was correlated with a marked defect in lytic viral DNA replication. wild-type ZEBRA and the AATAA mutant exhibited similar associations with Rp and oriLyt. additional factors, other than binding to naked DNA, contribute to the ability of ZEBRA to activate transcription of early viral lytic cycle genes and to promote lytic viral DNA replication. all the constructs are fused to either a maltose-binding protein (MBP) or FLAG tag on the N terminus. EMSA results clearly revealed the importance of amino acids 155 to 166 of ZEBRA, containing the newly identified RRTRK basic motif, for DNA binding. ITC measurements showed that Z(155-245) and full-length ZEBRA bound DNA with a similar affinity at a dissociation constant (Kd) of 140 nM. the similarity in binding affinities of Z(1-245) and Z(155-245) suggests that the presence of the transactivation domain does not impact DNA binding. 1,800 800 9,700 5,000 1,800 600 Z(155-245) AATAA 750 200 3,400 700 980 100 1,900 300 3,100 400 Z(175-245) 3,500 700 a All measurements were done by ITC except for those indicated with an asterisk. ZEBRA\u2019s RRTRK basic motif is essential for methylation recognition. FP affinity measurements of Z(155-245) binding to unmethylated (red) versus unmethylated (black) RpZRE3 14-mer DNA. all measurements were completed in triplicate. FP even at high protein concentrations of Z(155-245) binds the methylated RpZRE3 DNA as efficiently as full-length ZEBRA. the high-affinity binding is again observed to be methylation dependent. the RRTRK motif is included in Z(155-245) and Z(166-245) truncations binding to doubly methylated and unmethylated RpZRE3 DNA. we then used a cold oligonucleotide DNA competition assay to show that even in the presence of a 400 excess of unmethylated RpZRE3. full-length Z(1-245) and its Z(155-245) truncation have binding efficiency similar to that of site 2-methylated RpZRE3. when only site 1 is methylated, there is a 10-fold decrease in binding by both full-length ZEBRA and Z(155-245) to site 1-methylated DNA. ZEBRA was prebound to 20-mer or 21-mer radiolabeled DNA in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA truncations. however, further increasing the length of the DNA to greater than 15 nucleotides did not enhance ZEBRA\u2019s binding affinity. electromobility shift assays with 10 g extracts of HKB5/B5 cells expressing full-length ZEBRA protein with either radiolabeled 20-mer RpZRE3 site 2 methylated (C) or 21-mer radiolabeled ZpZIIIB (D) cold competitors of oligonucleotides of different lengths of RpZRE3 site 2 methylated or ZpZIIIB were added together with the probe. DNA length is shortened to 11 nucleotides with two flanking nucleotides on each side of the heptad. difference in affinities for doubly methylated RpZRE3 drastically decreases when only a single nucleotide flanks both sides of the heptad sequence. RRTRK amino acids are important for interaction with several DNA nucleotides flanking the heptad sequence. expression of two EBV early and two late mRNAs 48 h after transfection of BZKO cells with wild-type or RRTRK alanine substitution mutants was analyzed by qRT-PCR. the identity of the flanking nucleotides is also important for ZEBRA DNA binding. ZEBRA RRTRK basic region is important for high-affinity binding to DNA and methylation site recognition to activate DNA replication and EBV late gene protein expression. mutations in the RRTRK basic region affect DNA binding and methylation recognition. RRTRK basic residues are more specific for recognition of methylated than unmethylated DNA. mutants were expressed at similar levels in 293T cell extracts. we further assessed their DNA-binding affinity to doubly methylated RpZRE3. type ZEBRA in expression of two EBV early lytic cycle proteins, Rta, a transcription factor, and EA-D, the EBV DNA polymerase processivity factor. the RRTRK site mutants were all comparable to wild-type ZEBRA in activation of expression of EBV BRLF1 (Rta) and BMRF1 (EA-D) RNA. the defect of AATAA mutant in promoting late gene expression correlated with a marked defect the AATAA mutant activated expression of RNA and protein from early lytic genes BRLF1 and BMRF1 to levels comparable to those observed with wild-type ZEBRA. the main functional defect of the AATAA mutant that correlated with the DNA binding defect was failure to support the process of viral genome amplification and late gene expression. RRTRK significantly augments DNA binding of ZEBRA to well-documented naked ZEBRA-binding sites. mutation of the RRTRK motif to AATAA markedly reduces DNA binding affinity. this mutant is impaired in activation of lytic EBV DNA replication. mutating S186 to alanine reduces affinity of ZEBRA to methylated DNA. previous crystal structures do not capture the full mode of methylation-specific binding of ZEBRA to DNA. this is potentially due to lack of previously unappreciated DNA-binding basic motif of ZEBRA in these structures. RRTRK basic motif are essential for substrate recognition and methylation-dependent DNA binding. the inclusion of the basic motif in the minimal binding domain allows ZEBRA to bind the canonical methylated DNA in a specific manner at an affinity similar to that of full-length ZEBRA. this ensures that ZEBRA remains bound to DNA to allow it to scan the DNA for methylated CpG preferentially recognizing methylation at site 2. high-affinity binding of ZEBRA to nonmethylated ZEBRA response elements in the EBV origin of lytic replication is needed. as little as a 2-fold decrease in affinity for ZREs in oriLyt is associated with a defect in DNA replication (30). mutation of the RRTRK motif to AATAA was associated with profound defects in DNA binding, DNA replication, and late gene expression. ZEBRA\u2019s serine 186 (S186) is the major contributor to recognition of methylated DNA (12) Upon mutation of this residue to alanine, ZEBRA recognition of methylated DNA is ablated, eliminating its function in activation of the EBV lytic cascade (24). the structure of the ZEBRA S186A mutant bound to an AP-1 DNA sequence (25) confirmed the bZIP architecture of the viral protein. a segment of positively charged residues in the RRTRK basic motif is essential for both DNA methylation selectivity and high-affinity binding to nonmethylated ZEBRA response elements. a segment of basic residues N terminal to the basic DNA-binding domain of Fos is crucial for bending of the DNA and ultimately facilitating protein binding. methylation at cellular promoters is known to downregulate or silence transcription of the corresponding gene. but in the case of EBV, promoter DNA methylation is required for ZEBRA to activate the transcription of a specific subset of genes. this activating effect is believed to be a mechanism that prevents premature lysis of the host cells. the RRTRK motif upstream of the classical bZIP domain may play functional roles in the EBV lytic cycle. our experiments emphasize the importance of studying ZEBRA DNA recognition both in vitro, using pure protein and naked DNA. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 45 min. protein was eluted with Ni-NTA buffer B (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 400 mM imidizaole, 0.1 mM TCEP) ZEBRA and DNA were dialyzed against 20 mM Na2PO4, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP.
