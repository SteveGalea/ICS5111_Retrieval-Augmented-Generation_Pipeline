{"summary": "26 dermatology and sexually transmitted disease departments, 34 obstetrics-gynaecology clinics and 28 urology outpatient clinics selected from 34 hospitals of shenzhen regarded as our study sites. participants A total of 2754 participants were recruited in this study, and 2534 participants completed the questionnaire survey. gonorrhoea is a pyogenic infection of the urogenital system caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) that can cause epididymitis and prostatitis in men, and endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. females are more susceptible to NG infection than males due to differences in the structure of the reproductive systems. in 2011, the male-to-female gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio was 9.9:1, 6.4:1 and 4.3:1,6 8 9 respectively. gonorrhoea is one of the second-class infectious diseases, according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of china. for male patient with symptoms, secrete can be collected using swabs. for asymptomatic male patient, samples can be collected by placing swabs in urethra for 10\u201315 seconds. male patients without complications can be diagnosed conclusively with gonorrhoea with a positive Gram stain microscopy result. the patient should accept the physician's suggestion and get the NG test done. the physician confirmed that the patient had NG infection, and reported this case to CISDCP. the physician may also have forgotten to report the diagnosed gonorrhoea cases to CISDCP on time. 88 clinics, including 26 STD clinics, 34 OBGYN and 28 GUM clinics, were selected from 34 hospitals in shenzhen. a probability sampling strategy was generated on the basis of patient flow. participants were given a questionnaire to collect information on gender and sociodemographic characteristics. gonorrhoea patients were reported to CISDCP online within 6 or 12 h. male patients were tested using a Gram stain microscopic smear examination and/or NG-isolated culture. female patients were tested by NG-isolated culture. gonorrhoea patients who were tested for NG would get a true-positive result and be diagnosed with gonorrhoea. gonorrhoea patients would receive a true-positive result and be diagnosed with gonorrhoea, and the others\u2019 results would be false negative. most of the cases would be reported to CISDCP as required, and some would not because of the negligence of physicians. a total of 88 clinics, including 26 STD clinics, 34 OBGYN and 28 GUM clinics, were selected from 34 hospitals in shenzhen. a probability sampling strategy was generated on the basis of patient flow (measured by the average number of STD cases reported to CISDCP in 2009\u20132011) participants were given a questionnaire to collect information on gender and sociodemographic characteristics. a genital tract secretion specimen (urethral swabs from men, vaginal or cervical swabs from women) was collected from each participant and sent to the shenzhen center for chronic disease control (SCCDC) gonorrhoea cases are not mandatory reported to CISDCP. gonorrhoea patients would receive a true-positive result and be diagnosed with gonorrhoea. gonorrhoea patients would get NG test done and the others\u2019 results would be false negative. true diagnosis sex ratio, and true diagnosis sex ratio, were calculated for all participants. participants who were infected with NG were not given the NG test in clinics. gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio excludes influences of untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate. a total of 2754 participants (92.0%) completed the questionnaire survey. most of the participants were 20\u201339 years old (84.7%) more female patients were aged 20\u201339 years and had a residence permit outside of Shenzhen (88.2% and 80.0%, respectively) untested rate a total of 161 male patients with gonorrhoea (male: A+B+F) were detected by reference test among 1106 male participants (male: E+H) 51 accepted NG test in clinics (male: A+B+F), and 110 cases were missed. the untested rate among females was 88.1% (95% CI 83.2% to 93.0%) False-negative rate (%, 95% CI) +/+(A) /+(B) +/(C) /(D) Total (E) +(F) (H) Male 22 29 70 204 325 110 671 781 68.3 (61.9 to 74.7) 23.9 (17.7 to 30.0) 56.9 (47.3 to 66.5) 20.0 (76.9 to 100.0) the male-to-female sex ratio of the true-positive rate was 1.2:1 for false-negative cases, 29 of 51 male participants with positive reference test results had negative results at the clinics. the gender difference of the false-negative rate sex ratio was not statistically significant (p=0.105). orrhoea incidence sex ratio was 19.8:1, while reference test found 161 cases in 1106 male patients and 84 cases in 1420 female patients. the true diagnosis sex ratio was 2.5:1 compared to the true diagnosis sex ratio, the reported incidence sex ratio has been overestimated by a factor of 7.9. untested rate A total of 161 male patients with gonorrhoea (male: A+B+F, table 2) were detected by reference test among 1106 male participants (male: E+H) 51 accepted NG test in clinics (male: A+B+F) and 110 cases were missed. the untested rate among females was 88.1% (95% CI 83.2% to 93.0%) the gender difference of untested patients was statistically significant (p=0.001) the sex ratio of untested rate was statistically significant (p=0.001) 92 male participants received positive results for the NG test in clinics. 22 were confirmed by reference test, resulting in a true-positive rate of 23.9% (95% CI 17.7% to 30.0%) the gender difference for the true-positive rate was not statistically significant (p=0.661). gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio versus true diagnosis sex ratio. of the 1420 female participants, 4 were reported to the system by physicians. the true diagnosis rates for male and female participants were 14.6% and 5.9%, respectively. untreated NG infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, or even infertility and ectopic pregnancy in females. undiagnosed cases could become hidden reservoir of gonorrhoea infection and lead to a much more serious spread of the disease. a large number of female patients are unwilling to take such a long time to get an NG test result. physicians may opt for empirical antibiotic treatment instead of an NG test. by then, many female patients lost the opportunity to be detected, which explains why female patients have a higher untested rate. the diagnostic criteria should be updated to recommend NAATs as the standard method for gonorrhoea diagnosis. physicians should perform regularly NG screening tests for potential patients, particularly for female patients who are often asymptomatic. physicians should recommend NG tests for any patient with potential gonorrhoea. particular attention being paid to screening female patients as they are often asymptomatic."}
