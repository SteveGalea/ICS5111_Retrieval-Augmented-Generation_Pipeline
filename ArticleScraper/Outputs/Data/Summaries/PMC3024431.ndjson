{"summary": "influenza virus infection causes highly contagious, severe respiratory disorders and gives rise to thousands of deaths every year. however, the efficacy of currently approved defense strategies, including vaccines and neuraminidase inhibitors, is limited because the virus frequently acquires resistance via antigen drift and reassortment. neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir have been efficacious against the current H1N1 strain of swine origin. the incidence rate of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses in the united states increased from 0.7% in the 2006\u20132007 influenza season to 98.5% in the 2008\u20132009 influenza season [1]. the multifunctional viral non-structural protein (NS1) binds directly to the regulatory subunit p85, but not p85. it stimulates the lipid kinase activity of the p85-associated catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. underlying mechanisms by which PI3K contribute to viral infection remain controversial. Ras\u2013PI3K interaction regulates clathrin-independent endocytosis. we first prepared mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type mice and mice deficient in Pik3cg. PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis. the expression levels were shown to be comparable by immunoblotting. the mutants lacking Ras-binding retain the catalytic activity [23], [24] simultaneous visualization of early endosomes and late endosomes by fluorescently labeled dextran and LysoTracker. dextran transfer into late endosomes was significantly delayed in cells in which PI3K activity or Ras\u2013PI3K binding was absent. cellular events related to endocytosis were specifically disturbed in cells lacking the Ras\u2013PI3K interaction. Ras\u2013PI3K signaling regulates influenza virus entry. challenge with the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) strain resulted in reduced titers of progeny viruses in LY294002-treated and Pik3cg-deficient cells. cells indicated at the bottom were electroporated with expression vectors for CFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab7. after 24 h cells were infected with PR8 for 1 h, fixed, stained with an anti-NP antibody, and imaged using a confocal microscope. calculating the ratio of virus particles colocalized with CFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab7 to the total number of internalized particles was concomitantly retarded in knockout cells and in mutant PI3K-expressing cells. this suggests that Ras\u2013PI3K signaling also modulates virus trafficking from early to late endosomes via the regulation of endosomal maturation. influenza infection activates Ras\u2013PI3K signaling in the endosomes. to examine activity of endogenous Ras, we used the Bos pull-down method. the PI3K binding to Ras is critical for influenza virus infection. kinetics of Akt phosphorylation induced by influenza virus infection are apparently distinct from those of Ras activity. we postulated that Akt phosphorylation at the whole-cell level is an inappropriate indicator of PI3K activity at such an early stage of infection. wild-type and Pik3cg-deficient MEFs were infected with PR8 or mock infected. wild-type and Pik3cg / MEFs were stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for 10 min, and Ras activity and Akt phosphorylation were determined by pull-down analysis and immunoblotting respectively. Akt-PH recognizes the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). inhibition of PI3K activity actually resulted in the retention of viral particles in early endosomes. the results underscore an important role for the Ras\u2013PI3K pathway in PIP3 production in early endosomes upon influenza infection. mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from wild-type mice and mice deficient in Pik3cg. the treatment of wild-type MEFs with the pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced the uptake of dextran. however, the inhibitory effect observed in the mutant MEFs was significantly less than that of LY294002-treated cells. the expression levels were shown to be comparable by immunoblotting. the mutants lacking Ras-binding retain the catalytic activity [23], [24] this result demonstrates the significance of Ras-mediated activation of PI3K in the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis. dextran transfer into late endosomes was significantly delayed in cells lacking PI3K activity or Ras\u2013PI3K binding was absent. cellular events related to endocytosis were specifically disturbed in cells lacking the Ras\u2013PI3K interaction. challenge with the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) strain resulted in reduced titers of progeny viruses in LY294002-treated and Pik3cg-deficient cells. this resistance to influenza was restored by the expression of wild-type PI3K but not by that of the K251E mutant. cells indicated at the bottom were electroporated with expression vectors for CFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab7. after 24 h the cells were infected with PR8 for 1 h, fixed, stained with an anti-NP antibody, and imaged using a confocal microscope. the PI3K inhibitor promoted retention in early endosomes more efficiently than Pik3cg ablation. this suggests that other subtypes of PI3Ks also play a role in viral trafficking. Ras activation was effectively promoted at 30 minutes after PR8 infection. expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras S17N) inhibited influenza virus infection. Akt phosphorylation was induced by virus exposure for 6 hours. Akt phosphorylation at whole-cell level is an inappropriate indicator of PI3K activity. wild-type and Pik3cg-deficient MEFs were infected with PR8. after 0.5 h, the cells were subjected to a pull-down assay to determine Ras activity. Akt-PH recognizes the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). the molecule tagged with fluorescent proteins gives a measure of PI3K activation with spatiotemporal precision by its translocation to specific subcellular organelles. arrowheads indicate colocalization of NP, Akt-PH, and Akt-PH. PI3K pathway has gained general acceptance as one of the key regulators for the cellular entry of a range of viruses and intracellular bacteria. PI3K inhibition is effective in reducing titers of progeny viruses only when the inhibitor is applied earlier than 4 h.p.i., whereas the treatment at 4 h.p.i. or later is not able to display this effectiveness anymore [13], [14]. Akt phosphorylation was observed at 6 h.p.i. by immunoblotting. Akt activation may be independent of Ras, but rather mediated by the viral protein NS1. the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway is also reported to participate in events associated with late steps. in the present study, we utilized PI3K because this class IB PI3K can be expressed in a manner independent of the regulatory subunits [34], [35], which allows for the complementary expression of the catalytic subunit in the Pik3cg-deficient cells. this allows for the complementary expression of the catalytic subunit in the Pik3cg-deficient cells, as we demonstrated. a number of studies have attempted to identify the mechanism by which influenza enters cells and have implicated clathrin-mediated endocytosis. however, expression of a dominant-negative form of Eps15 and knockdown of epsin 1, both of which are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, do not hamper influenza virus infection. cDNA for PI3K was obtained from the Babraham Institute, UK.
