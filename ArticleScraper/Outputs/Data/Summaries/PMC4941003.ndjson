{"summary": "a literature review was carried out in peer-reviewed journals and media sources. this literature review formed the empirical basis for the formulation of the Medical Intelligence Framework proposed in the paper. almost any condition of ill-health could justify securitisation due to its ability to impair human capabilities. but in practice the rationale for securitising has not been focused on disease-affected communities, rather its perceived threat to the global community. a public health emergency of international concern refers to an extraordinary, unusual or unexpected event that has a serious and potentially international public health impact. the role of the medical intelligence sector in the securitisation of disease has been particularly prominent given the particularities of infectious disease in provoking disease outbreaks affecting military operations. the relatively novel idea that infectious disease cannot only perpetuate conflict, but also precipitate it, is changing the way that policymakers address health within their agendas. the use of military intelligence in the process of securitisation minimises the ill-health of what are frequently the world\u2019s poorest populations to a condition meriting attention purely on the basis of threat to armed elites. the designation of a disease security threat has the potential to legitimate the enactment of a state of exception, which may precipitate the blurring of ethical standards in the wake of an increasingly normalised paradigm of risk and threat. this sequence relies on health threats catalysing action within the securitisation agenda, with policy action occurring in response to such threats. the failure to adhere to this framework demonstrates the adverse consequences associated with the infringement of the public health space and the blurring of foreign policy concerns with medical initiatives. implications for global health governance structures likely to necessitate a greater embrace of securitisation by the WHO. non-governmental organisations such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res will protest the difficulty maintaining the perception of neutrality in this paradigm of global health.
