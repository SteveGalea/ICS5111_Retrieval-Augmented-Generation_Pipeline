{"summary": "MERS-CoV causes a lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics are available. two MAbs target different epitopes on the MERS-CoV spike protein. annexin A2 mediates localization at the plasma membrane. Vaccinia Virus Inhibits Stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. virulent poxviruses antagonize DNA sensing by inhibiting STING activation. this inhibition is not mediated by strains being developed as vaccine vectors. average viral loads for each immunization group. average viral loads for each group."}
