{"summary": "leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by at least 18 species of parasites from the Leishmania genus and transmitted to humans by hematophagous sandflies. both belong to the trypanosoma sp. family and are ranked among the three major protozoan parasites affecting humans. clinical manifestations range from self-healing cutaneous lesion to fatal visceral form. an estimated 16\u201318 million people are infected in the Americas. close to 100 million people are at risk of infection after a short benign acute phase. current chemotherapy relies on nitrofurans (Nifurtimox), or nitroimidazoles (Benznidazole) plasmid DNA is a very stable molecule, specially compared to recombinant or live attenuated vaccines. administration is easy as simple IM or ID injections can be sufficient. multiple plasmids can be combined for the elaboration of multivalent vaccines. earliest DNA vaccine experiments against leishmania used L. major GP63 antigen. many different DNA vaccines were able to induce a Th1 immune response. however, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of the different vaccines to induce a protective immune response. LACK 2 100 g IN L. amazonensis +++ [22] LACK 2 100 g IM or SC L. chagasi Th1, IFN [24] LACK 2 100 g ID or SC L. chagasi Th1 [25] LACK Prime/boost L. major Th1 +++ [26] LACK Prime/boost L. major Th1 +++ [27] LACK Prime/boost L. major Th1 +++ [29] L a few studies provided interesting comparisons of the same antigens administered as recombinant protein or DNA vaccines. the latter were overall more effective than their recombinant protein counterparts. DNA vaccines were able to induce a stronger Th1 bias in the immune response, a longer-lasting immunity, and a better protection against disease progression. prime-boost immunization protocols have been tested with various antigens to increase vaccine potency. they are based on priming the immune response with a DNA vaccine and boosting with the corresponding recombinant vaccine based on recombinant virus or protein (Table 1). a major drawback of such vaccine formulation remains its complexity, which may limit their practical use. the identification of protective library subsets from an amastigote cDNA library leads to the identification of novel protective antigens. most of the antigens identified would not have been predicted to be good vaccine candidates. this is the next logical step following the recent completion of the L. major genome sequencing. a DNA vaccine encoding L. donovani nucleoside hydrolase NH36 has therapeutic activity against murine visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. chagasi [60] the simplicity of such treatment makes them very advantageous compared to chemotherapy. the fact that the same DNA vaccine can be effective for both the prophylaxis [40] and the therapy of this parasite is thus very promising. a single formulation of NH36 DNA vaccine was found to induce a very good protection against both L. chagasi and L. mexicana. a number of salivary antigens have been tested as vaccines against Leishmania. gene vaccines against nonmurine leishmaniasis may lead to the identification of new vaccine candidates. but salivary protein polymorphism remains an important issue. 3.8.

DNA vaccines tested against murine leishmaniasis. the nature of the antigen encoded by the vaccine is a key parameter for efficacy.

TSA-1 DNA was found to induce a specific CTL response. the immune response was protective as determined by an increase in survival and a decrease in parasitemia. lyT1 2 25 g C57BL/6 IFN, CTL +++ [96] FCaBP/Tc24 2 25 g C57BL/6 IFN, CTL +++ [96] Tc3 2 25 g C57BL/6 IFN, CTL +++ [96] KMP11 4 doses IM BALB/c CTL to ++ [100] IM: intramuscular; CTL: cytolytic activity; +: little protection; +++: very good DNA vaccines based on defined T cell epitopes from TS antigen have also been tested. both CD4+ and CD8+T cell epitopes were necessary and sufficient to induce a protective immune response. vaccination did not result in increased pathology, as initially feared, but allowed at least partial control of disease progression. the lack of efficacy of these multivalent vaccines may be attributed to the presence of shared or immunodominant epitopes. the lack of efficacy of these multivalent vaccines may be attributed to the presence of shared or immunodominant epitopes. a number of studies have aimed at identifying novel antigens through various strategies. the nature of the antigen used remains a key factor for vaccine efficacy. a number of studies have aimed at identifying novel antigens through various strategies. a growing consensus is that protection against T. cruzi relies on a Th1 immune response and the activation of cytotoxic CD8+T cells. there are over 1400 members in this family, making it one of the largest protein families of the parasite, and they are very abundant surface proteins. antigen type of antigen dose mouse strain Immune response protection reference TS 154 TS family BALB/c Th1, CTL +++ [84, 89, 90] ASP-2 TS family 2 100 g IM C57BL/6 CTL +++ [87, 91].
