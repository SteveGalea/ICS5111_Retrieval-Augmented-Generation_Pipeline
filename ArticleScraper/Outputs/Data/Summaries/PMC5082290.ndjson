{"summary": "the mortality rate of severe acute pancreatitis is about 30\u201350%. alcohol abuse followed by duct obstruction and bacterial infection induced by a gallstone is the major cause leading to acute pancreatitis (4\u20137) there is no specific treatment available for acute pancreatitis therapy at this time. autophagy flux inhibitor wortmannin was reported to protect against trypsinogen activation induced by cerulein. however, wortmannin is not so effective in inhibiting autophagy. autophagysome accumulation due to autophagy blockage is probably the key factor for zymogen activation. spautin-1 ameliorated cerulein- or L-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis. calcium overload, another characteristic of acute pancreatitis, can rapidly activate pancreatic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) spautin-1 was obtained from the laboratory of Jun Ying Yuan in Shanghai. cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone) all mice were housed in micro-isolator plastic cages and supplied with a basal diet. mice were randomly selected and killed for serum amylase analysis three, six and nine hours after the last injection of cerulein or L-arginine. the mice were sacrificed nine hours after the last injection of cerulein or L-arginine. parameter Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 P value* Edema degree 1.000.00 3.250.5 2.250.5 0.001/0.03 Inflammation degree 0.250.50 2.250.5 1.500.58 0.001/0.098 Vacuolization degree 0.000.00 2.750.96 2.000.00 0.001/0.168 Necrosis degree 0.000.00 1.250.50 0.500.58 0.002/0.098 Total score 1.250.50 9.501.29 6.251.26 0.001/0.011 *The sates from AR42J cells were mixed with BGAM in trypsin reaction buffer. the fluorescence intensity was measured at 450 nm under excitation at 37\u00b0C. the calcium was visualized by fluorescence microscopy imaging. 1% Triton X-100-soluble or insoluble fractions from culture cells and mice pancreatic tissues were dissolved in 2% SDS separately. t test or one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the significance of the differences between groups. supplementary materials are available online at www.molmed.org. animals were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone) at 37\u00b0C using standard techniques. all animals were housed in micro-isolator plastic cages and supplied with a basal diet and autoclaved distilled water ad libitum. group 4 (control); group 5 (L-arginine), L-arginine-induced pancreatitis without spautin-1 treatment; and group 6 (L-arginine + spautin-1), L-Arginine-induced pancreatitis with spautin-1 treatment. some of the mice were randomly selected and killed for serum amylase analysis three, six and nine hours after the last injection of cerulein or L-arginine. 3 Inflammation degree 0.250.50 2.250.5 1.500.58 0.001/0.098 Vacuolization degree 0.000.00 2.750.96 2.000.00 0.001/0.168 Necrosis degree 0.000.00 1.250.50 0.500.58 0.002/0.098 Total score 1.250.50 9.501.29 6.251.26 0.001/0.011 *The P value indicates the statistical significance for the differences between Group 4 and 5/among Group 5 and 6. the fluorescence intensity was measured at 450 nm under excitation at 37\u00b0C. the calcium was visualized by fluorescence microscopy imaging (29) Western Blots Protein extracts from culture cells and mice pancreatic tissues were separated and quantified by sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Error bars for Western blot analysis represent the standard deviation between densitometry data from three unique experiments. AR42J cells were treated with 200 nmol/L cerulein (A) or 10 mmol/L L-arginine (B) for 22 h followed by chloriquitone (CQ) or normal saline treatment (Control) for two hours. the levels of LC3II, p62 and ubiquitination (Ub) were next analyzed. results from Western blotting revealed that ubiquitination of protein aggregates was upregulated significantly in insoluble fraction. soluble ubiquitination remained almost constant (Figures 1A\u2013D; Supplementary Figures S1A, S1B) spautin-1 inhibits trypsinogen activation induced by cerulein or L-arginine. results showed spautin-1 can inhibit trypsinogen activation induced by cerulein or L-arginine. in intra-acinar cells, we detected protein levels of LC3II, p62 and ubiquitylated protein aggregates using Western blotting. the results showed that the levels of both LC3II and p62 decreased in the AR42J cells with both cerulein and spautin-1 treatment compared with cerulein but without spautin-1 treatment. this downregulation by spautin-1 occurs in a time-dependent manner. increased levels of serum TNF caused by cerulein were inhibited in the presence of spautin-1. spautin-1 treatment can ameliorate the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein or L-arginine. p65 (F), LC3II, p62, beclin1 and Ub (H) in the pancreatic tissues. increased levels of p62 and beclin1 protein decreased under spautin-1 treatment. similar results were observed in the mice model with acute pancreatitis using L-arginine. spautin-1 reverses cytosolic calcium overload induced by cerulein or L-arginine in vitro and in vivo. acinar cells were treated with the indicated concentration of cerulein (A) or L-arginine (B) for 24 h and then cells were stained with Fluo-4-AM according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. spautin-1 significantly diminished cytosolic calcium load caused by cerulein or L-arginine. results showed that the phosphorylation of CaMKII gradually increased with the time and dose of cerulein or L-arginine. this increased phosphorylation level induced by cerulein or L-arginine would decrease under conditions of spautin-1 treatment. results showed that the level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 form II (LC3II) increased when cells were treated with only cerulein or CQ. however, there were no further increments in LC3II level under the conditions of treatment with both cerulein and CQ. this suggests that autophagy could be blocked in pancreatic acinar cells under cerulein treatment. ubiquitination of protein aggregates was upregulated significantly in insoluble fraction. ubiquitination of protein aggregates was upregulated significantly in insoluble fraction. in vitro reaction catalyzed by trypsin from pancreatic acinar cells. spautin-1 reduces impaired autophagy and inhibits trypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells with cerulein or L-arginine treatment. spautin-1 reduces impaired autophagy and inhibits trypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells with cerulein or L-arginine treatment. the relative levels of LC3II, p62 and beclin1 expression were quantified using Image J. the results showed that the levels of both LC3II and p62 decreased in the AR42J cells with both cerulein and spautin-1 treatment compared with cerulein but without spautin-1 treatment. mice constructed mice models with acute pancreatitis using cerulein or L-arginine. spautin-1 pretreatment significantly diminished the elevation of serum amylase and lipase levels, which are indicative of trypsin activity. spautin-1 treatment can ameliorate the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein. cerulein injection for analyzing serum amylase, lipase and TNF levels (A), histopathological change (C) and the levels of p65 (F), LC3II, p62, beclin1 and Ub (D) in the pancreatic tissues. the data from serum analyses were tested using one-way ANOVA. spautin-1 reverses cytosolic calcium overload induced by cerulein or L-arginine in vitro and in vivo. calcium chelator BAPTA-AM was used to conform the relationship between calcium elevation and trypsinogen activation in acinar cells. cells were treated with 200 nmol/L cerulein (E) or 10 mmol/L L-arginine (F) for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 mol/L spautin-1. cytosolic calcium may affect autophagy (35\u201337), but spautin-1 played a role in the calcium signaling pathway. spautin-1 effectively protected against trypsinogen activation induced by cerulein or L-arginine in vitro or in vivo and ameliorated acute pancreatitis. this is likely mediated via decreasing the level of impaired autophagy and alleviating cytosolic calcium overload. spautin-1 was shown to promote the transformation of ubiquitylated protein aggregates to soluble form. thus protein aggregate accumulation as the result of autophagy blockade might be an important target in ameliorating acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein or L-arginine. however, there still exists evidence suggesting that autophagy promoted pancreatic acinar cells survival. autophosphorylation of caMKII is indicative of an elevated level of cytosolic calcium in hepatocytes. phosphorylation of verapamil could alleviate liver injury. phosphorylation of spautin-1 could be considered to be a marker of an increased calcium level in hepatocytes."}
