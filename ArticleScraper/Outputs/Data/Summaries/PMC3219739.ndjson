{"summary": "the ORF6 protein is one of the eight accessory proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) it suppresses expression of co-transfected expression constructs and localizes vesicular structures. alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif in the ORF6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected expression constructs. a putative diacidic motif in the ORF6 protein was found to influence its subcellular localization and ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs. a subclassification was due to the presence of several accessory genes in the coronavirus which have no known homologs within the family Coronaviridae. the ORF6 protein has been suggested to induce intracellular membrane rearrangements resulting in a vesicular population in the infected cell. such virus-induced vesicles have previously been shown in other viral infections, such as protein trafficking in Herpes simplex virus (11) and sendai virus (12). cells were cultured in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. ORF6 was cloned into the pXJ3'HA vector using sites BamHI and XhoI with a stop codon to create pXJ3'-ORF6 expressing an untagged protein. escence Vero E6 cells were plated in 60mm dishes containing coverslips. they were then transfected with mammalian expression plasmids relevant to the experiment being performed. the cells were infected with SARS-CoV Frankfurt strain 1. gels containing separated lysates were transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes before blocking with 5% skimmed milk in PBS-Tween. after each incubation, membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes each with PBS-Tween. 6 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of pXJ3'-ORF6 (0 - 2 g) and a fixed amount of pXJ40myc-nsp8 (1 g) for each sample, the total amount of DNA was normalized to 3 g by addition of the empty vector, pXJ3'HA. cells were scraped into media and spun down in a benchtop centrifuge. quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in a Roche Lightcycler 2.0. nsp8 gene from SARS-CoV was cloned using sites BamHI and XhoI with a stop codon to create pXJ3'-ORF6 expressing an untagged protein. GST was cloned into pXJ40flag to create pXJ40flag-GST. the mutants were generated by 2 rounds of PCR. the first round of PCR was used to generate 5' and 3' fragments of ORF6. SARS-CoV Infection Vero E6 cells grown on coverslips were infected with SARS-CoV Frankfurt strain 1. cells showed 75 % cytopathic effects and were subjected to immunofluorescence. cells were scraped into media before being spun down in a benchtop centrifuge and washed twice with PBS. metabolic labeling vero E6 cells were transfected with 1 g or 2ug of either pXJ3'-ORF6 or empty vector. cells were starved using DMEM without L-glutamine, cysteine and methionine (Perkin Elmer) before being incubated with 100 Ci of 35S-labelled cysteine and methionine (Perkin Elmer) for 30 minutes. equal amounts of each cDNA sample were reverse transcribed using poly d(T)12-18 (Invitrogen) and with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following manufacturer instructions. equal amounts of each cDNA sample were added to a portion of reaction mix (Roche) along with either of the following primer pairs. YBR Green Master mix used the same primers for nsp8 and GAPDH. results The ORF6 protein exerts an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs. Western blotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of nsp8. plasmids encoding for ORF6 and nsp8 (A), ORF6 and GST (B) or GST and nsp8 (C) were lysed 16 hours post transfection and subjected to Western Blot analysis using equal amounts of lysate from each transfection. o E6 cells were transfected for 16 hours with increasing amounts of pXJ3'-ORF6 or an empty vector, pXJ3'HA. cells were starved of methionine and cysteine for 1 hour and labeled with a mixture of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine for 30 minutes. the ORF6 protein exerts a transcriptional effect on nsp8 expression. vero E6 cells were co-transfected with 1 g of pXJ40myc-nsp8 and different amount of pXJ3'-ORF6. total RNA was normalized to 3 g by addition of the empty vector, pXJ3'HA, when necessary. a mammalian expression plasmid pXJ3'-ORF6 was transfected into vero E6 cells and analyzed in the same manner with the same antibody. the pXJ3'-ORF6 protein localized to a similar population of intracellular vesicles. alanine substitutions in the putative diacidic motif in ORF6 exert an effect on impedance of nsp8 expression. aa49-52 (YSEL) was predicted to be a lysosomal targeting motif YXXL (18) and aa53-56 (DDEE) bears similarity to a putative diacidic motif DxE. vero E6 cells were transfected with 1 g of pXJ40myc-nsp8 and either 0 g, 1 g, 2 g of either pXJ3'-ORF6 (left panel), pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 (right panel) or pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 (right panel) 16 hours post transfection, cells were harvested, lysed and subjected to Western Blo nsp8 and either wildtype ORF6, ORF6A49-52 or ORF6A53-56 showed increased levels of expression compared to wildtype ORF6. the effect of ORF6A49-52 mutant on the expression of the nsp8 gene was similar to wildtype ORF6. on the other hand, the nsp8 expression in the presence of ORF6A53-56 was higher than that in the presence of wildtype ORF6. the difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A49-52 is statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.08) the difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 is statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.01) this indicated that the reduction in the suppression of the expression of co-transfected pXJ3'-ORF6, pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 or pXJ3'-ORF6A53-56 shows altered subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. western blotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of nsp8. ORF6 specifically impedes expression of co-transfectants. cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding for ORF6 and nsp8 (A), ORF6 and GST (B) or GST and nsp8 (C) vero E6 cells were transfected for 16 hours with increasing amounts of pXJ3'-ORF6 or an empty vector, pXJ3'HA. a fraction of lysate was subjected to Western Blotting using an antibody directed against the ORF6 protein (upper panel) total RNA was harvested 16 hours later, reverse transcribed and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using primers and probes specific to nsp8 and cellular protein, GADPH. the Ct method was used to calculate the nsp8 mRNA level with respect to the level in the absence of ORF6. a mammalian expression plasmid pXJ3'-ORF6 was transfected into vero E6 cells and analyzed in the same manner with the same antibody. ORF6 localized to a distinct population of intracellular vesicles in these infected cells. a significant degree of colocalization between the Lamp1 and ORF6 in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells. this allowed us to use pXJ3'-ORF6-transfected Vero E6 cells to further study the characteristics of this vesicular population. the plasmid system employed here yields similar colocalization of ORF6 with cellular markers as seen in previous infection work. alanine substitutions were introduced by two-step PCR to yield ORF6A49-52, which substituted four alanine residues for the YSEL region. ORF6A53-56, which substituted four alanines for the DDEE region, exert an effect on impedance of nsp8 expression. a schematic of the ORF6 amino acid sequence showing the position of two putative motifs. alanine substitution mutants were cloned into the same vector as the wildtype ORF6 gene and titrated against the nsp8 gene. the effect of ORF6A49-52 mutant on the expression of the nsp8 gene was similar to wildtype ORF6. the effect of ORF6A53-56 on the expression of the nsp8 gene was similar to wildtype ORF6. the levels of nsp8 mRNA for both ORF6 mutants were slightly higher than wild-type ORF6. however, at 2 g, the levels of nsp8 mRNA for both mutants were slightly higher than wild-type ORF6. the difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A49-52 is statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.08) pXJ3'-ORF6, pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 or pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 were found to spread diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. the mutant protein localized to vesicles that were clustered into groups of 3-5 vesicles to form large aggregates. a bioinformatics approach to defining regions of interest in the ORF6 gene has identified 2 regions of interest, a putative lysosomal targeting motif YSEL between amino acids 49 to 52 and a putative diacidic motif DDEE between amino acids 53 to 56. the difference is small and suggests that the diacidic motif is largely dispensable for this function of ORF6. the region from amino acids 53 to 56 is involved in the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein. alanine substitution of this region results in a clustered-vesicle phenotype that is not observed with wild-type ORF6. the reason for the difference in the subcellular localization of wild-type ORF6 is not clear."}
