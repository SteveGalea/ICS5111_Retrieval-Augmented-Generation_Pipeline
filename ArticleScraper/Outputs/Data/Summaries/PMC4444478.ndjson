{"summary": "investigators have focused on episodes occurring in infants characterized by an unexpected change in behavior either with or without apnea. these episodes were referred to as \"near-misses\" for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (1), and considered a possible cause of SIDS. all patients were admitted for evaluation and medical intervention. the patients' characteristics, status upon hospital arrival, diagnostic investigation, medical treatment, clinical outcome, and final diagnosis were investigated. each intervention was classified as significant medical interventions. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS for Windows, version 21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) all values were described as frequencies and median with range. the Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to compare significant intervention scores according to patients' clinical characteristics. electrocardiograms, 2-dimensional echocardiograms, upper gastrointestinal studies, electroencephalograms, brain image studies, and tests for metabolic disease were ordered on an individual patient basis. a confirmed bacterial or viral infection, abnormal chest radiographic finding, ECG, 2-dimensional echocardiogram, upper gastrointestinal study, EEG, brain image study, and any test to characterize metabolic disease were classified as significant diagnostic interventions. recurrence of ALTE and death during hospitalization were also classified as significant interventions 12 preterm infants (41.4%) were preterm infants, and 8 (27.6%) were low birth weight infants. median gestational age was 35.5 weeks (range, 27.5-36.3 weeks) and 2 patients were diagnosed as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. no mother presented with a history of smoking. twenty patients arrived at the hospital during the day, while 9 arrived at night. 12 patients showed sick appearance such as cyanosis, grunting, chest retraction and atonic posture. the predominant symptoms for ALTE diagnosis were apnea and color change. the median duration of ventilator care was 2.0 days (range, 1-25 days) seventeen patients were treated with parenteral antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection. the most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection in 10 patients. the next most common cause was neurologic disease such as a convulsive disorder, congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and Haddad syndrome. related causes in 2, previously known congenital heart disease-related ALTE in 1 and sedative medication-related ALTE in 1 remained unexplained. the median duration of hospitalization was 8.0 days (range, 2-38 days), and 20 patients showed repeat ALTE in the hospital. the final diagnoses were pneumonia with prematurity history in 2, Haddad syndrome in 1 and narrowing of supraglottic larynx with GER grade III in 1. the median patient age was 39.0 days (range, 3-220 days), with a peak incidence of age younger than 1 month. peak incidence of age was younger than 1 month (48.3%); 69.0% of patients were younger than 2 months. 12 patients visited an ED, and 17 patients visited an outpatient department. URI symptom 17 (58.6) Event criteria Apnea 20 (69.0) Color change 17 (58.6) Change in muscle tone 9 (31.0) Choking 6 (20.7) Gagging 3 (10.3) Route on hospital (OPD:ED) 12 (41):17 (59) Time of arrival (20 (69):9 (31) URI, upper respiratory infection. median duration of ventilator care was 2.0 days (range, 1-25 days) seventeen patients were treated with parenteral antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection. infections were suspected to be pneumonia with respiratory symptoms in 11, sepsis with fever or shock in 4 and urinary tract infections with pyuria in 2. Two patients required CPR because of bradycardia and hypotension during the initial ALTE, but recovered. the most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection in 10 patients. the next most common cause was neurologic disease such as a convulsive disorder, congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and Haddad syndrome. the median duration of hospitalization was 8.0 days (range, 2-38 days) and 20 patients (69.0%) showed repeat ALTE in the hospital. one death caused by group B streptococcal meningitis occurred at 25 days after admission. the admission rate for ALTE is usually 75%-100% (9, 10, 11, 12), reflecting the recommendations of many centers that all patients with ALTE be admitted for a period of inpatient observation. the most common diagnosis was gastrointestinal disease, including GER. the most frequently evaluated diagnostic tests were for GER, neurologic abnormalities, anemia, infections, toxic ingestions, metabolic disorders, and cardiac dysrhythmias. there was no evidence to recommend routine nonspecific tests such as CBC, serum glucose, or electrolyte levels (20) a positive result is not a confirmation of a relationship between GER and ALTE. the authors recommended a clinical decision rule based on components of patient history and examination findings that have been established as significant predictors. in order to determine whether to discharge patients from the ED, the authors recommended a clinical decision rule based on components of patient history and examination findings that have been established as significant predictors. we found no cases of mortality after discharge, but there were 4 cases of recurrent ALTE after discharge occurring nearly within 2 weeks. the number of deaths was too small to analyze any potentially significant difference of clinical course according to death."}
