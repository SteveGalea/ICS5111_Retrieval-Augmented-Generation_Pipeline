{"summary": "breakthroughs may be dramatic, but they are never sudden. a well thought-out and structured process is behind virtually every medical breakthrough. monkeys play a vital role in basic science research that can come decades earlier. scientists use monkeys only when no other research model can provide the required information. but their usefulness is limited by differences from primates in their lack of sophisticated brain structures, less developed immune systems and motor skills. this difference limits the applicability of rodent studies in relation to studies of injury in the human brain. the new treatment has led to complete remission in two glioblastoma patients. the harmless form of poliovirus is injected into glioblastoma tumors. the immune system recognizes the poliovirus as a dangerous invader and attacks \u2013 killing it and the cancer along with it. scientists are looking for vaccines that can prevent HIV infection. drugs that keep the virus in check now give millions of HIV-infected people hope for a long and productive life. people with well-treated HIV still face more health problems than those without HIV. researchers can study pregnant monkeys much as an obstetrician follows a woman's pregnancy. they can take blood, monitor fetal development through ultrasounds. they can then test vaccines and drugs with the hope of protecting the fetus. transplant patients receive drugs to suppress their immune system. the drugs come with a risk of toxicity and increase the risk of other problems, including cancers and infections resulting from a weakened immune system. scientists are mapping the activity of billions of neurons deep inside the brain. they can actually see what parts of the brain are involved in sending the signals that take in, process, and store the newly acquired information. this type of research has relevance to Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, all forms of dementia. brain-machine interfaces translate signals in the brain into directions to move prosthetic arms. this area of research shows enormous promise for humans who are paralyzed, such as injured veterans. experiments in monkeys have been vital to moving this field forward both conceptually and technically. high blood pressure is a major factor in heart disease - the number one killer in the u.s. and the world. high blood pressure leads to stroke, kidney damage, memory problems, and many other illnesses. monkeys are the ideal model for testing new therapies for people with diabetes. obesity is a contributing factor to the condition. more than a third of american adults are obese. poliovirus is being tested as a way to help the body's immune system see and destroy glioblastomas. the harmless form of poliovirus is injected into glioblastoma tumors where it attaches to the cancer cells. it was 18 years from the earliest research until the first study in humans. scientists are looking for vaccines that can prevent HIV infection and treatments leading to a cure. scientists are looking for vaccines that can prevent HIV infection and treatments leading to a cure. researchers are working with macaque monkeys to understand the impact of Zika. the virus in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a condition where the child is born with a small head due to abnormal brain development. it also appears to cause stillbirth, miscarriages, and fetal growth restriction. researchers can study pregnant monkeys much as an obstetrician follows a woman's pregnancy. they can take blood, monitor fetal development through ultrasounds, and collect amniotic fluid. they can then test vaccines and drugs with the hope of protecting the fetus. scientists are mapping the activity of billions of neurons deep inside the brain. they can actually see what parts of the brain are involved in sending the signals that drive thinking, mood, movement, and much more. this type of research has relevance to Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, all forms of dementia. a combination of breakthroughs in neuroscience, computer processing and robotics has led to development of brain-machine interfaces. brain-machine interfaces translate signals in the brain into directions to move prosthetic arms. this area of research shows enormous promise for humans who are paralyzed, such as injured veterans, or those with brain damage and paralysis due to stroke. baboons and humans: Unique Connections for Blood Pressure Control Monkeys have certain traits and characteristics that make them essential and irreplaceable in medical research. high blood pressure is a major factor in heart disease \u2013 the number one killer in the united states and the world. type 2 diabetes develops in monkeys just as it does in humans. monkeys provide a critically important study model for human obesity. monkeys provide a critically important study model for human obesity. 1900-1950s Components of blood and plasma discovered. ability to diagnose and treat typhoid fever, modern anesthesia. discovery of the Rh factor, blood-typing knowledge critical for safe blood transfusions. treatment of congenital cataracts and \u201clazy eye\u201d in children. first animal model for research on human Parkinson's disease. first treatment of naturally diabetic NHPs with a hormone-like insulin stimulus. first controlled study to reveal that even moderate levels of alcohol are dangerous in pregnancy. first controlled study to reveal that even moderate levels of alcohol are dangerous in pregnancy. a chemical found in plastic, on prenatal development improves health of children and adults. adapted with permission from: Primate Info Net, National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison. first animal model for research on Parkinson's disease. first treatment of naturally diabetic NHPs with a hormone-like insulin stimulus. many important translational discoveries in the field of transplantation will never happen. primate embryonic stem cells studied extensively for the first time. control of intimal hyperplasia, a complication of coronary bypass surgery. Parent to child lung transplants for cystic fibrosis. the article was originally published as a report by the Foundation for Biomedical Research. it was sponsored by the following organizations that support carefully regulated research with nonhuman primates."}
