{"summary": "endothelium is the monolayer of endothelial cells (ECs) that lines the interior surface of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and heart chambers. the microvessels of the brain represent 3-4% of the brain compartment and constitute a significant length (ca. 400 miles) and surface of exchange (ca. 20 m2) between the blood and parenchyma of the brain. microvascular ECs have specific phenotype in blood vessels of different organs and surrounding tissues. the well-studied endothelial morphological phenotypes are continuous (blood-brain barrier), fenestrated (exocrine and endocrine glands, gastric and endocrine glands, gastric and intestinal mucosa, choroid plexus, glomeruli, and a subpopulation of renal tubules) vascular and liver sinusoidal ECs are abundantly present in other ECs. the transfer of macromolecules across the endothelium is mediated by caveolae and vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (VVOs) and transendothelial channels. the density of caveolae in capillary endothelium may amount up to 10,000 per cell. inflammatory stimuli trigger transformation of ECs to a proinflammatory and procoagulatory state. in large amounts, ROS have a negative impact on endothelial and other cells. low concentrations of ROS have signaling functions being permanently produced in cells. the first designated endothelial markers are still under the scrupulous attention of many researchers. the first designated endothelial markers are still under the scrupulous attention of many researchers, and great progress has been made. transmembrane homophilic adhesion protein is highly expressed on endothelial cells. the extracellular domain of CD31 is released during endothelial cell apoptosis. the presence of CD34 on nonhematopoietic cells has been linked to progenitor and adult stem cell phenotypes. CD39/ENTPD1 CD39 catalizes extracellular dephosphorylation of ATP to ADP and AMP. CD39 molecules are liberated from the coronary vascular endothelium by ischemia-reperfusion. levels of circulating ectonucleotidase may reflect severity of ischemic vascular injury. CD54/ICAM-1 ICAM-1 is a transmembrane adhesion protein that is upregulated on endothelial and epithelial cells at sites of inflammation. it mediates the vascular adhesion and paracellular migration of leukocytes with activated LFA-1 and Mac-1. hepatic sinusoidal ECs have the ability to express the costimulatory adhesion molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), expression of which can be increased by ischemia/reperfusion of the rat liver. CD93/C1qR1 C1qR1 is also known as C1qRp, collectin receptor, and AA4 antigen. endoglin haploinsufficiency can cause vascular disorder, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I. soluble form VCAM-1 promotes monocyte chemotaxis. IL-1 RI binds the pleiotropic cytokines IL-1 and IL-1, plus the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra) signal transduction requires complex formation with IL-1 R AcP/IL-1 R3. IL-1 RI is expressed predominantly by T cells, fibroblasts, and ECs. CD142/coagulation factor III/tissue factor/thromboplastin Tissue factor is an integral membrane protein, which has been shown to be produced by several cell types, including ECs. ACE and ACE2 are cell surface proteases, which maintain blood pressure homeostasis and fluid salt balance. tetraspanin superfamily glycoprotein is expressed on ECs, epithelial cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. it interacts with other tetraspanins and integrins, such as 3/1, 6/1, 6/4, and 7/1. CD160 plays a role in antiangiogenic signaling and apoptotic cell death. CD248/endosialin Endosialin is a 165 kDa transmembrane O-glycosylated protein. it contains one C-type lectin, one sushi, one EGF-like domain. it regulates pericyte proliferation, migration, and adhesion to matrix fibronectin and collagens I and IV. disintegrin and metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are responsible for the impairment of vascular barrier by hypoxia, possibly through proteolysis of claudin-5, a tight junction molecule, on EC membranes. ADAMTS-13 is a zinc-containing metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor. it is produced in liver stellate cells and is present in platelets. ESAM ESAM (endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule) is a member of the endomucin family of proteins. it functions as either a pro- or antiadhesive molecule, depending on its glycosylation pattern. hypoxia affects expression of FABP in ECs. Integrin 41/VLA-4 Integrin 41 (VLA-4) and VCAM-1 ensure close intercellular adhesion between ECs and pericytes. lyve-1 is a marker of lymphatic ECs and is also expressed on hepatic sinusoidal ECs. notch notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved pathway critical for cardiovascular development. Podoplanin Podoplanin is a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein with extensive O-glycosylation. it is expressed by lymphatic ECs, as well as by nonendothelial cells in some tissues. TEM8/ANTXR1 Tumor endothelial marker 8 is one of eight TEM gene products that are associated with tumor angiogenesis. THSD1 THSD1 is a type I transmembrane protein of 95 kDa. it is abundantly expressed on ECs, with the highest expression in the lung. THSD1 is involved in the regulation of vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis. VE-cadherin is a major endothelial adhesion molecule controlling cellular junctions and blood vessel formation. VE-statin is a member of a rather large family of EGF-like domain-containing proteins. VG5Q is associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) a loss of VWF in ECs results in enhanced and dysfunctional angiogenesis. angiotensin-converting enzyme is one of the principal members of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) only 20% of capillary ECs in each organ stains for ACE. in the lung, all capillary ECs express ACE, while in the kidney, all the vasculature is devoid of ACE. the reduced ACE expression in the renal vasculature may protect the renal circulation against excess angiotensin II formation and kinin depletion. ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is a pathway that acts against the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system. several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, PKC activation, and MAP kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway. VEGF receptors 1\u20133 contain an extracellular segment with seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, a ju the Angpt-Tie system controls postnatal angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, and permeability to maintain vascular homeostasis in adults. the Angpt-Tie system also controls postnatal angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, and permeability to maintain vascular homeostasis in adults. hypoxia enhances Angpt-1 expression due to HIF2-mediated transcriptional activation in pericytes. Angpt-2 activated by Angpt-1 stimulates Rap1 GTPase, which reduces radial stress fibres via Rac1 and nonmuscle myosin II. VE-PTP indirectly dephosphorylates VEGFR2 via a Tie-2-dependent mechanism. cell adhesion molecules (CAM) make up a significant group (at least a couple of dozen) of endothelial markers, which are involved in homo- or heterophilic binding with other cells or with the extracellular matrix. all representatives of the four principal protein families are expressed on the surface of ECs, including IgGs. a loss of intercellular adhesion creates gaps between the ECs. ECs lose ICAM-1 from their surface (shedding), which then acts as an independent signaling agent supporting the inflammatory process in endothelium. studies on the regulation of endothelial phenotype and the principal signs of the state of endothelium are very interesting and hold much promise. they respond within minutes to haemodynamic forces, vasoactive, thrombogenic, or inflammatory agents. they follow a linear receptor-mediated cell signaling pathways with influx of calcium ions, activation of phosphorylations and enzymes that generate auto- or paracrine regulators. calcium disbalance precedes the ROS-induced dysfunction of ECs. in many cases, calcium disbalance precedes the ROS-induced dysfunction of ECs. in ECs, around 75% of \u04302+ is kept within ER and up to 25% in mitochondria. TRPM2 channels are considered to be sensors of oxidative stress and redox status of cells, and their activation enhances probability of cell death. extracellular buildup of amyloid- (A) in Alzheimer's disease impairs endothelial structure and function through activation of the TRPM2. exogenous H2O2 increases [Ca2+]i and decreases transmembrane electrical resistance in lung microvascular ECs via activation of the Src the signaling complex K/Nox is activated at different pathophysiological states. p47phox can be phosphorylated by many other kinases. rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is controlled by various signals. X through RFK is bound to the \u201cdeath domain\u201d of TNFR1 and to the p22(phox) subunit of NOX [136]. H2O2 is produced from superoxide anion as a result of dismutation reaction, spontaneously or catalyzed by superoxide dismutases (SOD) ECs exposed to very high H2O2 concentrations for 24 h or longer died exclusively via necrosis. apoptosis was shown to be a common form of the cell death. apoptosis was shown to be a common form of the cell death. ACE molecules are presynthesized and stored in endothelial cells. most significant change was in CD54 expression, which started to increase even at 15 min of PMA application (38%), with its expression increased more than fivefold 3 h after exposure. next most manifest response was the level of expression of CD309 (VEGFR-2), which is known to increase endothelial permeability in microvascular bed. changes in CD106 and CD29 expression were generally insignificant. at all concentrations of PMA or H2O2, an increase of 16\u201324% in expression of these antigens was observed after 24 h. a combined (simultaneous or consequent) increase in expression of surface antigens of ECs under oxidative stress certainly determines the development of vascular dysfunction. alterations in the metabolism of nitric oxide and prostanoides, endothelin-1, thrombomodulin, and VWF potentiate the procoagulant status developed with aging. alterations in the metabolism of nitric oxide and prostanoides, endothelin-1, thrombomodulin, and VWF can protect ECs against vascular aging. TGF- binding with subsequent activation of Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGF- intracellular signaling is considered to be the most important pathway for initiation of EndoMT [160]. hypoxia is another factor inducing EndoMT via HIF-1 activation of Snail1. blockade of endothelial miR-21 expression reduced EndoMT [162] blockade of endothelial miR-21 is expressed downstream of TGF- and activation of TGF- signaling leads to its overexpression. stimulation of endothelial autophagy seems promising in reduction of EndoMT. tocilizumab, pirfenidone, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lipid lysophosphatidic acid 1 and NOX4 inhibitors are capable of modulating fibrotic and inflammatory pathways involved in systemic sclerosis pathogenesis. geniposide (an iridoid glycoside isolated from the gardenia plant) and glycyrrhizin (a saponin of Glycyr a loss of VWF in ECs results in enhanced and dysfunctional angiogenesis. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is one of the principal members of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), converting angiotensin I to vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, degrading bradykinin and amyloid beta-protein. 20% of capillary ECs express ACE, whereas in the kidney, all the vasculature is devoid of ACE. the reduced ACE expression in the renal vasculature may protect the renal circulation against excess angiotensin II formation and kinin depletion. ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is a pathway that acts against the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system. several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, PKC activation, and MAP kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway. VEGF receptors 1\u20133 contain an extracellular segment with seven immunoglobulin-like domains. the Angpt-Tie system controls postnatal angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, and permeability to maintain vascular homeostasis in adults. the Angpt-Tie system also controls postnatal angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, and permeability to maintain vascular homeostasis in adults. hypoxia enhances Angpt-1 expression due to HIF2-mediated transcriptional activation in pericytes. Angpt-1 activates Rap1 GTPase, which reduces radial stress fibres via Rac1 and nonmuscle myosin II. VE-PTP indirectly dephosphorylates VE-cadherin via a Tie-2-dependent mechanism. platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1, CD31) is a 130 kDa protein. it is widely distributed on endothelium and hematopoietic-derived cells. it maintains the integrity of the blood vessels and therefore is involved in leukocyte-endothelium interaction. ICAM-1 is one of the principal adhesion molecules, which determines changes of endothelial permeability and transendothelial leukocyte migration. in brain ECs, the increase in ICAM-1 expression is observed 4 hours after a stimulus and continues up to 72 hours even after a short-term application of stimulating agents. ROS and other modulators of the state of endothelium Exposure to many agents and factors determines the phenotype and life span of ECs. they respond within minutes to haemodynamic forces, vasoactive, thrombogenic, or inflammatory agents. they follow a linear receptor-mediated cell signaling pathways with influx of calcium ions, activation of phosphorylations and enzymes that generate auto- or paracrine regulators. calcium disbalance precedes the ROS-induced dysfunction of ECs. in ECs, around 75% of \u04302+ is kept within ER and up to 25% in mitochondria. there are 11 potential molecular sources of mitochondrial ROS [20] TRPM2 channels are considered to be sensors of oxidative stress and redox status of cells. extracellular buildup of amyloid- (A) in Alzheimer's disease impairs endothelial structure and function.

H2O2 is produced from superoxide anion as a result of dismutation reaction, spontaneously or catalyzed by superoxide dismutases (SOD) in endothelial and some other cells, H2O2 production is catalyzed by NADPH oxidase 4 [137] the ratio of early apoptosis and necrosis in the HUVECs cultured close to the physiological conditions was estimated after exposure to H2O2 concentrations not over 500 M. the primary mechanism of cytotoxic response is apoptosis. lower concentrations of H2O2 (up to 200 M) cause death of individual cells. expression in plasma membranes depends mainly on PKC, which controls shedding of ACE from the cells. expression of CD54 started to increase even at 15 min of PMA application (38%), with its expression increased more than fivefold 3 h after exposure. the next most manifest response was the level of expression of CD309 (VEGFR-2), which is known to increase endothelial permeability in microvascular bed. a combined (simultaneous) increase in expression of surface antigens of ECs under oxidative stress determines the development of vascular dysfunction. early and late events developed in ECs upon the influence of oxidative stress. explanations and abbreviations are given in the text. sirtuins SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6 can protect ECs against vascular aging. it is a process through which certain subsets of ECs lose endothelial characteristics and transform into mesenchymal-like or smooth muscle-like cells. this event is coupled with loss of apical-basal by polarity and severance of intercellular junctions. -dependent and Smad-independent TGF- intracellular signaling is considered to be the most important pathway for initiation of EndoMT [160]. a plethora of data suggest that Snail1 is a crucial regulatory molecule in EndoMT. blockade of endothelial miR-21 expression reduced EndoMT. TGF- is considered to be a major mediator of EndoMT. bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7, also known as osteogenic protein-1 or OP-1) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are reported to increase or oppose TGF--driven EndoMT in specific contexts. glycyrrhizin, a saponin of Glycyrrhiza glabra or liquorice root, improved dermal fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice. bleomycin-dependent induction of T helper type 2-skewed immune polarization, M2 macrophage infiltration, and EndoMT greatly suppressed in mice administered glycyrrhizin [170] ECs, their progenors and derivatives, can be biomarkers per se. the population of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is high. levels of endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are low. study of Mediterranean spotted fever showed a significant increase of transaminases in the supernatant, along with specific endothelial markers. in some patients, increased levels of transaminases in the liver and spleen were also registered. bilirubin, albumin, and -globulin were also at normal levels. lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and endothelial cell lipase play a central role in triglyceride and phospholipid hydrolysis [179]. -glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase are also biomarkers of endothelial damage [7, 180]. op poisonings usually proceed with predominance of a heavy cholinergic crisis. op-induced distal sensorimotor axonophaty; symptoms of vegetative changes of the circulatory system; the CNS \"microorganic disorders\" with unknown ethiology. op-binding sites are dislocated near the GTP-binding sites. chlorpyrifos over a wide concentration range showed no effect on isolated thoracic aorta, though plasma AChE activity was decreased, while LDH, ALT, GGT, and AST activities were increased in the chlorpyrifos group. we also paid attention to damage of the vascular endothelium in development of OP-induced delayed pathology. the morphological and functional changes of the microvessels can affect the functional state of platelets. the observed changes reflect multiple microangiopathies. the observed changes reflect multiple microangiopathies. aminopeptidase A (CD13/APN, EC 3.4.11.2) hydrolyses acidic amino acids. it is expressed on cells of myeloid origin, including monocytes and neutrophils. alphastatin, a 24-amino acid peptide derived from the amino terminus of the -chain of human fibrinogen, possesses an antiangiogenic activity. complex biomarkers should be relatively simple (low-invasive and noninvasive methods), universal (modular) and flexible (algorithmic) morphological methods are not a common tool in clinical diagnostics. a biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosing many chronic diseases. a significant elevation of eotaxin concentration was revealed in blood plasma of the \u201cdirty zone\u201d personnel. the differences between the control group and personnel occupied in \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cconditionally dirty\u201d zones in the CWDF are much greater. metabolomics deals with a high-dimensional dataset and a huge number of parameters. metabolomics deals not only with biomarkers (e.g., metabolomics) but also with biomarkers (e.g., metabolomics) metabolites of foreign substances (drugs, poisons, etc.) are called xenometabolites, or xenobiotics. biomarkers can be divided into three categories: biomarkers of exposure (concentrations of chemicals, their adducts and derivatives in the body fluids or tissues as result of external or internal exposure) chemometrics originated in the 1970s at the intersection of mathematics (informatics) and analytical chemistry. the methods of metabolomics are not intended to replace the methods of classical biochemistry (spectrophotometry, enzyme immunoassay, etc.) hypotaurin/taurin indicates abnormality in the mechanisms of utilization of Cys and may lead to deficit of glutathione. the redox hypothesis covers not only the energy aspects, but also implies a violated interface between energetic, signaling, and metabolic processes. transaminases are traditionally considered to be markers of the liver and heart. an experiment with infection of ECs with Rickettsia conorii showed a significant increase of transaminases in the supernatant, along with specific endothelial markers. elevated levels of triglycerides, apoB, -glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase were also observed in some patients, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and -globulin were at normal levels. endothelium and toxicology of Organophosphates More complex and obscure is a role of endothelium in the development of effects after chronic or acute exposure to some toxic agents. ECs became famous in 1980 as the site for generation of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF), later revealed to be nitric oxide. mechanistic studies are reduced to revealing interactions of OPs with molecular targets in nerve cells. it was estimated that OPs can interact with covalent binding to tyrosine residues of tubulin. the OP-binding sites are dislocated near the GTP-binding sites or within loops interacting with protofilaments. conduction is of great interest taking into consideration the low percentage of endoneural capillaries. the volume of capillaries does not exceed 4% of the total volume of nerve fibre. there are no lymphatic vessels within the peripheral nerves, which could prevent development of edema. two weeks after subacute intoxication with VR (Russian Vx). norepinephrine- (NA-) induced contraction and carbachol- (CCh-) induced relaxation of rat aorta after subchronic exposure to paraoxon (a) and DFP (b) alphastatin, a 24-amino acid peptide derived from the amino terminus of the -chain of human fibrinogen, possesses an antiangiogenic activity. many other proteolytic degradation products were also revealed as endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. an ideal biomarker is characterized by a high sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, likelihood ratio, and so forth. biomarkers for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis represent simple, directly measurable parameters and their derivatives (indices or ratios) the ratio of AST to the level of ALT, the ratio of AST to the number of platelets, the PGA index, and the FibroTest, known as FibroSure in the US, including -2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1 and GGT. a combination of markers defines a combinatorial biomarker. a combinatorial biomarker provides a specific pattern that bears much more information than just individual markers. a combination of markers provides a specific pattern that bears much more information than just individual markers. the metabolome is the end product of the genome; in fact, it is the totality of all the metabolites, predominantly of low molecular weight. metabolomics deals not only with biomarkers (e.g., metabolites of endogenous origin), but also with biomarkers of exposure. the advantages of NMR are the simplicity of sample preparation and spectrum interpretation, as well as high performance. high-performance liquid chromatography with mass-selective detection (HPLC-MS) is much more sensitive to low molecular weight (3000 Da) metabolites and even peptides. the ratio of concentrations of pyrophosphate (i) and oxalate in the blood plasma was found to be the most sensitive biomarker, called the \u201cpyrophosphate index,\u201d whose changes were statistically significant in all groups. increased level of i in blood plasma is evidently caused by a decreased level and/or activity of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which is a marker of the BBB endothelial cells [7] phenomics is a novel approach to quantitatively correlate multiple phenotypic traits to variabilities in transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, interactome, and environmental factors, together with genome. phenomics is a novel approach to quantitatively correlate multiple phenotypic traits to variabilities in transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and environmental factors, together with genome. toxicometabolomics is intended to integrate our understanding of toxicokinetics of chemicals and the toxicodynamics of physiological and biochemical response to toxic effects. the result of this integration can be a complete mapping of the \u201ctoxicity pathways\u201d and creating a \u201ctoxome\u201d\u2014a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of action of substances and the relationship between the dose, time, and consequences of exposure. antioxidant supplementation exerts adverse effects, especially on adaptation to intense training. some natural metabolites can effectively neutralize oxidative stress, improve health, and even enhance adaptation to physical stress. redox biology/medicine uses compounds that have been termed \"pathologically activated therapeutics\" disulfide bond formation is possible due to oxidative potential existing in specific cellular compartments. the winner is one of the first contestants to enter: oxygen. many nutraceuticals have multiple molecular and functional targets in humans and animals. westernised FPs correlated with biomarkers of inflammation and atherogenesis. peripheral neuropathy is among the prevailing neurologic conditions encountered by physicians and toxicologists. stem cells retreived from eldery patients tend to be presenescent or already in senescence. in vitro manipulations can cause the aged stem cells to undergo massive in vivo apoptosis after transplantation. in order to prevent or even cure a disease, we need to repair blood vessels in advance or parallel. application of nutraceuticals and physical activities for curing endothelium would greatly help all the tissues and organs, according to their place in the body, ontogenetic features, and functional traits."}
