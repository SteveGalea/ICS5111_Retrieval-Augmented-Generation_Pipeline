{"summary": "ARDS is characterized by an acute diffused and inflammation lung injury. it leads to intense trans-epithelial leukocyte infiltration, exudate accumulation in the lungs, loss of integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, and tissue damage. there are more than 3 million ARDS cases annually worldwide. hydroalcoholic extract of pomegranate leaves inhibits TNF- production and decreases neutrophil migration. ethyl acetate fraction of pomegranate leaves was effective in treating LPS-induced ALI in mice (8). the fractions obtained were subjected to another round of chromatography. one of them containing galloyl-HHDP-glucose of >95% purity. the structure was determined using HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT/MS analysis. mice were anesthetized with thiopental (80 mg/kg), tracheostomized, and connected to a ventilator. the respiratory system elastance (Ers) and resistance (Rrs) were obtained using the equation of motion of the respiratory system as previously described (4). RT-qPCR assays with Lung Tissues The left lung (100 mg) was mechanically homogenized with a using a TissueLyser II bead mill (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) the quantity of purified RNA was measured at 260/280 absorbance using a nanodrop Lite Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) histology The right lung lobes were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 24 h. sections (4 m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the criteria used in the evaluation were alveolar and peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrate, (2) alveolar septum thickening. the lung TNF-, IL-6, IL1-, IL-8, and IL-10 protein levels were analyzed using ELISA kits. results are expressed as protein levels, in pg/mL. all experiments were performed in triplicates. antibodies used for immunoblot were anti-p65-NF-B and anti-phosphorylate p65-NF-B. membranes were then washed for 30 min with saline with Tween 20. 100 L of MTT at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL for 3 h and centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature to remove the supernatant. the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 15 min and absorbance read was determined by 570 nm. the structure of galloyl-HHDP-glucose was determined using HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT/MS analysis. the data obtained were compared to those verified in a previous study which investigated the chemical structure of galloyl-HHDP-glucose. mice were anesthetized with thiopental (80 mg/kg), tracheostomized, and connected to a ventilator. the respiratory system elastance (Ers) and resistance (Rrs) were obtained using the equation of motion of the respiratory system as previously described (4). RT-qPCR assays with Lung Tissues The left lung (100 mg) was mechanically homogenized with a using a bead mill (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), with 5-mm stainless steel beads. total RNA was extracted using an RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the quantity of purified RNA was measured at 260/280 absorbance using a nanodrop Lite Spectrophotometer (Thermo the criteria used in the histological evaluation were (1) alveolar and peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrate, (2) alveolar septum thickening, and (3) edema. the inflammatory infiltrate scores were established: absence (not observed in any field), mild (1\u20133 observed fields), moderate (4\u20136 observed fields) and intense (over 7 observed fields) sample readings for each cytokine were compared with a standard curve. results are expressed as protein levels, in pg/mL. all experiments were performed in triplicates. the bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (1:10,000) and visualized by chemiluminescence using UVItec. the band intensities were quantified using the UVItec Image Program. 1,800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature to remove supernatant. formed formazan crystals were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. absorbance read was determined by 570 nm with 655 nm as the wavelength reference. the results were calculated as % increase relative to that in the control. -actin was used as a constitutive protein. the values are presented as median and interquartile. xamethasone had no effect on IL-10 gene expression. no doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose or dexamethasone had any effect on IL-10. mice were randomly allocated to 6 groups (n = 6/group) mice received galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg; p.o), dexamethasone (DEXA; 5 mg/kg; p.o), or vehicle (PBS; p.o). the values are presented as median and interquartile. mice received galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg; p.o), dexamethasone (DEXA; 5 mg/kg; p.o), or vehicle (PBS; p.o). no differences were observed in the number of macrophages between groups. galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment significantly reduced leukocyte infiltration compared with infiltration in vehicle-treated LPS mice. dexamethasone-treated animals also displayed attenuated lung inflammation. galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatments significantly reduced all parameters in LPS-challenged animals, compared with those in the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice (p 0.05, Figures 7A\u2013E). the mice received different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment reduced Phosphorylation of the NF-B p-65 Subunit and JNK in the Isolated Lung Tissues. animals with ALI showed an increased expression of phosphorylated p-65-NF-B/total p-65-NF-B, compared with the saline-treated group. test analysis of the groups vs. saline-injected non-treated mice (*p 0.05) and vs. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-installed non-treated mice (#p 0.05) gel is representative of results obtained in an experiment repeated four times. galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment reduced pro-inflammatory protein levels in the Isolated Lung Tissues LPS-induced increases in IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-8 protein levels in the lung homogenate samples were down-regulated by treatment with either galloyl-HHDP-glucose or dexamethasone. galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated mice showed reduced body weight loss at all doses tested, compared with those of the vehicle-treated ALI mice. inflammatory cells were also evaluated in the BALF. NOVA followed by Tukey test analysis of the groups vs. saline-injected non-treated mice (*p 0.05) and vs. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-installed non-treated mice (#p 0.05) total protein levels were augmented in lung samples obtained from mice with ALI. sections (4 m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and viewed with a microscope at 100x and 400x magnification respectively. signs were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test analysis. significances were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test analysis. effect of galloyl-HHDP-glucose on cell viability of RAW 264.7 cells. galloyl-HHDP-glucose blocked the activation of NF-B, thus, regulating lung inflammation. galloyl-HHDP-glucose blocked the activation of NF-B, regulating inflammation. galloyl-HHDP-glucose treated rats with acute peritonitis (8). galloyl-HHDP-glucose reduced the number of peritoneal leukocytes. the main therapeutic effect exhibited by Galloyl-HHDP-glucose was to reduce the cytokine production by suppressing NF-B and MAPKinase activation. this results strongly suggest that Galloyl-HHDP-glucose impairs the generation of these inflammatory mediators by interfering with these signaling pathways in leukocytes. the pulmonary dysfunction caused by the intense inflammatory response is related to lung failure, which results in death of JdS, and LL-N critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
