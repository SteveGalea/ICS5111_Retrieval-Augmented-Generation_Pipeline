{"summary": "human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection in children. they are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C. they are characterized by sequencing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients. none of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise. a new species of HRV-C was recently identified worldwide by comparative analysis of VP4 or VP4/VP2 genes [7], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] and 5\u2032UTR [14], [15]. however, discrepancies have appeared in the classification of some of the new HRV-A or HRV-C strains. results Identification and typing by phylogenetic analysis of 66 HRVs in NPSs from children with ARI Eight hundred and twenty-seven samples were collected from a group of children consulting the Shanghai Nanxiang Hospital during a 2-year period. sixty-four samples (7.7%) were positive for HRV, according to the length of the amplified fragment in the VP4/VP2 region visualized on agarose gel. only one sample, N1, could not be amplified 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 Sequence Virus/Gene Starta Enda Reference CAAGCACTTCTGTYWCCCC P1-1 F 163 181 [15] ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG P3-1 R 536 554 [13] ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG P3-1 R 536 554 [13] ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG P3-1 R 536 554 [13] ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG P3-1 R 536 554 [13 outer F 6846 6871 Id CAATCAGATGGACTAGACCCAA N4 3D inner F 6904 6924 Id a Nucleotide position relative to HRV16. we first compared and classified Shanghai strains according to their VP4/VP2 position. twenty-seven HRVs (40.9%) showed >81% nucleotide identity with the closest HRV-A clusters. five HRVs (7.6%) showed >88.8% nucleotide identity with HRV-B clusters. the remaining 34 strains (51.5%) diverged from HRV-A and HRV-B species by >47.3%. classification N64 Hanks 5.3 A N14 R98 5.8 A N31 R23 6.3 A N3,N16A (98.8) R38 6.5 A N19 R12 7.7 A N66 R75 8.5 A N65 R10 9 A N23 R22 9 A N13,N47 (98.6) R47 9.1\u20139.7 A N37,N49,N51c (98.1\u201399) R58 9.2\u201310.4 A N40 R39 9.4 A N29 R28 b Strains closely related with more than 96% identity. c Strains isolated within 3 months. a subspecies classification based on local 5\u2032UTR sequence variation. 5\u2032UTR sequences were considered to characterize and classify further the Chinese HRV strains. they were compared to those of 26 new strains identified in children with respiratory illness in Wisconsin (indicated as W) [15], and to those of other recently identified HRV-C strains [14]. 2.1 A N3,N16A (100) R38 2.2 A N65 R10 2.5 A N40 R39 3.2 A N14 R98 3.3 A N29 R28 3.3 A N11,N15 (98.2) R31 3.6\u20134 A N37,N49,N51 (99.3\u201399.7) R58 3.6\u20134.3 A N44c R40 3.7 A N71 R9 3.7 A N54 R90 4 A N66 R75 4 A N23 R22 a subspecies based on phylogenetic analysis and local recombination in 5\u2032UTR. b Strains closely related with more than 93% identity. c These strains clustered differently when based on VP4/VP2 sequences. our 20 strains clustered together with these six strains in two major branches in the phylogenetic tree constituted a subspecies of HRV-C called HRV-Ca. fourteen other strains formed another unique branch of HRV-C subspecies, called HRV-Cc. these strains were related closely to some W strains of HRV that were classified as HRV-C [15] stretches of nucleotide sequences closer to HRV-A (R16) than to HRV-Cc (N10) could be detected in the 5\u2032UTR of HRV-Ca strains. these nucleotide stretches were thus flanked by putative recombination sites. these sites were located differently among the HRV-Ca strains. the full-length N10 genome sequence was compared to those of the HRV-Ca subspecies strains C024, C025 and C026, and to that of N4 strain, which was sequenced as the representative of the HRV-Ca subspecies. the genome sequences were also compared to those of the HRV-A strains N13 and R44, and to the HRV-B strains R14 and R52. aa VP4 (aa) VP2 (aa) VP3 (aa) VP1 (aa) 2A(aa) 2B(aa) 2C(aa) 3A(aa) 3B(aa) 3C(aa) 3D(aa) R44 A 7123 612 49 2154 69 266 238 281 142 95 322 77 21 183 460 CQ223229 R14 B 7212 the VP1 amino acid sequence of HRV-Cc strain N10 showed structural features typical of HRV-C species [16], [20], [25] (data not shown) footprints including deletions in the BC, DE and HI loops and conserved amino acids potentially involved in inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1 receptor binding [7], [11], [20], [24] were conserved within the HRV-C species. the closest HRV-A 2A nucleotide sequence available was 80% identical to that of N4 in this region. the closest HRV-A 2A nucleotide sequence was 80% identical to that of N4 in this region. HRVs were isolated throughout the 2 years, with a predominance of HRV-C viruses in the cold season (Table 5). different HRV genotypes were detected within the same period (for example, N1 and N4, N9 and N11/N12, N44/N48 and N51, and N55/N56 and N62/N67) single HRV infection was diagnosed in 42 children and co-infections were identified in 22 patients. the viruses most often identified in HRV co-infections were RSV (six cases) and human bocavirus (HBoV; four cases), and two patients were co-infected with HRV, HBoV and RSV (Table 5). there was no difference between HRV-Ca or HRV-Cc subspecies. the nucleotide sequences located in the 5\u2032UTR (285 nt) and the VP4/VP2 genes (420 nt) were chosen to allow comparative alignment with sequences of reference serotypes and field strains available in GenBank. table 1. degenerate and specific primers used for RNA amplification from clinical samples. 10 Id GGTGAGGGTCCATGTGAACCWGGT N4 2A outer F 3473 3496 Id GGGTCCATGTGAACCWGGTGACTGT N4 2A inner F 3478 3502 Id CACGTCATCCCCATATGCGATCA N4 3D inner R 6669 6691 Id CAATCACGTCATCCATATGCGA N4 3D outer R 6669 6691 Id CTAAATACCCCATATGCGA N4 3 we first compared and classified Shanghai strains according to their VP4/VP2 sequences. twenty-seven HRVs (40.9%) showed >81% nucleotide identity with the closest HRV-A clusters. five HRVs (7.6%) showed >88.8% nucleotide identity with HRV-B clusters. clinical HRV strain nearest divergence with the Species (% nt identityb) classification of 66 strains in clinical specimens based on partial VP4/VP2 gene sequences. phylogenetic tree was constructed using aligned VP4/VP2 sequences. b Strains closely related with more than 96% identity. c Strains isolated within 3 months. a subspecies classification based on local 5\u2032UTR sequence variation. 582385, EF582386, EF582387) designated by a pink triangle. viral strains classified in HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca subspecies are indicated by filled and open circles. echo 11 and R87 prototypes are included as outgroups. clinical HRV strains Nearest HRV strain Divergence with the species (% nt identity)b nearest HRV classification N64 R21 1.4 A N9 W28 1.4 A N19 R12 1.8 A N12c R82 2.1 A N3,N16A (100) R38 2.2 A N65 R10 2.5 A N40 R39 3.2 A N14 R98 3.3 A N29 R28 3.3 A N11,N15 (98.2) R31 3.6\u20134 A phylogenetic tree depicting relationships between known and novel HRVs based on 5\u2019UTR analysis. 20 of the 34 strains classified as HRV-C by comparative analysis of VP4/VP2 sequences were related more closely to HRV. the nucleotide sequences in the 5\u2032UTR of these strains were related closely to those of formerly identified QPM, NAT001, NAT045, C024, C025 and C026 HRV-C strains. however, our 20 strains clustered together with these six strains in two major branches in the phylogenetic tree constituted a subspecies of HRV-C called HRV-Ca. bootscanning and similarity plot analyses were conducted in the gene fragment of 868 nt that included the 5\u2032UTR and adjacent capsid genes. recombination sites were found in the 5\u2032UTR of the previously described HRV-C strains C024, C025, NAT001, NAT045 and QPM. strains gathered in the same HRV-Ca subcluster displayed the same recombination pattern. the subclusters revealed different recombinant lineages, each of which originated from independent recombination events. the full-length N10 genome sequence was compared to those of the HRV-Ca subspecies strains. the unique putative cleavage site between VP4 and VP2 protein identified previously for QPM, C024, C025 and C026 strains [20] was also observed for N10 and N4 strains. it was different from those of the HRV-A strains N13 and R44 (Q/S) and from those of the HRV-B strains R14 and R52 (n/S) Q223227 C024 C 7099 615 52 2144 67 261 235 274 142 99 326 75 22 183 460 EF582385 C025 C 7114 616 42 2152 67 264 239 275 142 99 326 75 22 183 460 EF582386 C026 C 7086 611 49 2142 67 262 233 275 142 97 325 76 22 183 460 EF582387 a N4 strain (HRV-Ca) was closer to R16 (HRV-A) than to R52 (HRV-B) or N10 (HRV-Cc) this resulted in high bootstrap values between N4 and R16 2A sequences. the closest HRV-A 2A nucleotide sequence available was 80% identical to that of N4 in this region. the majority of HRV infections were diagnosed between 2 and 6 years of age (84.6%) bronchitis (73.4%) and pneumonia (26.6%) were highly prevalent in children with comparable incidence in HRV-A and HRV-C infections. only one child among the 64 HRV-positive patients had asthma. 1c HEV 1 2 HMPV 1 IAV 1c a Patient co-infected by two HRV-A and HRV-B strains, and PIV1. single HRV infection was diagnosed in 42 children and co-infections were identified in 22 patients. there was no difference between HRV-Ca or HRV-Cc subspecies and any of the clinical or epidemiological data. in previous studies targeting the 5\u2032UTR of HRVs, Lee et al. (2007) have identified nine novel HRVs among 103 HRVs from Wisconsin (19.4%), which segregated from HRV-A and HRV-B and were classified as HRV-C [15]. this led us to propose a classification of two HRV-C subspecies, HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca. the strains of HRV-C species identified in the present study were characterized by analyzing the 5\u2032UTR, VP4 and part of VP2. this approach showed the advantages of covering only 5\u2032NCR, VP4/VP2, VP1 or 3D genome fragments. this region of the genome may be useful for building a database of the novel strains that are circulating worldwide. phylogenetic incongruities in 5\u2032 UTR, VP1 and 3CD sequences of two clinical isolates of HRV-A related to recombination. we observed incongruent clustering of N12, N44 and N48 strains of HRV-A species in the phylogenetic trees based on the 5\u2032UTR or the VP4/VP2 regions of their genomes. previous comparison of genome sequences between 34 HRVs showed only limited length nucleotide sequences of two field strains of different HRV-C subspecies (N4 and N10) with those of other HRV species suggested multiple interspecies recombination events occurred in the 5\u2032UTR and in the NS2A protein gene. recombination also occurred in the 3\u2032UTR between N4 and a strain close to N10. this result appeals for the full-length genome sequencing of the major representatives of the HRV-C species only one patient co-infected with HRV-C, IAV and RSV was diagnosed with asthma among the HRV-positive patients. the difference observed with previous studies, 44.6% [8] and 12% [29] asthma in HRV-positive patients may be related to criteria for enrolment.
