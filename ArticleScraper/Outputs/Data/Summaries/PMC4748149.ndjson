{"summary": "atraumatic necrosis of the femoral head is a common cause of hip arthrosis in middle age. in germany, it affects 5000\u20137000 patients per year, corresponding to an incidence of 0.01%. patients with this problem should be diagnosed early and given stage-appropriate treatment. long-term corticosteroid treatment is the most frequent and most important risk factor. treatment for 2 to 3 months with a daily dose of 2 g prednisolone equivalent or more is regarded as critical (6). smoking has also been established as a risk factor, although no dose\u2013effect relationship has been established. non-specific symptoms and an initial absence of abnormalities on plain radiographs may lead to a fateful delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. medical history and clinical examination The patients often report symptoms in the hip joint independent of movement. diagnostic algorithm in the case of suspected atraumatic femoral head necrosis (FHN) is shown in Figure 1. Diagnostic procedure in the event of suspected atraumatic femoral head necrosis (FHN) magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy enable detection of early changes (12) magnetic resonance imaging has sensitivity and specificity of >95%. it visualizes bone marrow changes and enables confirmation of diagnosis even in early stages of FHN. MRI enables good evaluation of the size and location of the osteonecrotic zone, the extent of involvement of acetabular cartilage, and the depth of joint collapse. single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a scintigraphic modality with improved spatial resolution and tomographic image presentation. it has higher sensitivity than planar scintigraphy, but lower sensitivity and specificity than MRI (18). the ARCO classification is the one most often used in Europe, particularly in the German-speaking countries (20) the disease stage and the extent and location of necrosis are crucial predictive factors. the disease stage and the extent and location of necrosis are crucial predictive factors with regard to joint collapse and treatment success (21, e8) high-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with low risk of systematic error (bias) 1 Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with high risk of systematic error (bias) 2++ High-quality systematic reviews of case control or cohort studies with low risk of systematic distortion (confounding, bias, chance) and moderate probability that the relationship is causal 2 Case control or cohort studies with low risk of systematic distortion (confounding, bias, chance) Bisphosphonates Alendronate may relieve the pain from early-stage FHN. all studies had a short duration of follow-up, however, so no final conclusions can be drawn with regard to progression. anticoagulants and statins have achieved no relevant amelioration of pain or reliable prevention of disease progression. the other substances used for the treatment of FHN have mostly been reported in studies with small case numbers. Surgical treatment Joint-preserving operations are performed principally in ARCO stage I and II FHN, but can also be carried out in stage III disease. corrective osteotomies are technically demanding and have a relatively high complication rate. insertion of an implant is often harder to accomplish in patients with previous corrective osteotomy (34). vascularized and non-vascularized bone transplants. cemented and cementless arthroplasty are comparable with primary coxarthrosis. joint-preserving operations are performed principally in ARCO stage I and II, but can also be carried out in stage III disease, depending on severity and site of necrosis. the results of hip arthroplasty in advanced FHN are good, with short- and long-term outcomes comparable with those for primary coxarthrosis and FHN (39). a systematic review of national registers of total arthroplasty revealed 6-year survival rates of 95 to 97% for both primary coxarthrosis and FHN (39). atraumatic FHN in adults is a locally destructive disease of multifactorial origin. if left untreated, it may lead within a few years to severe joint destruction. some risk factors are known to be associated with increased incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head."}
