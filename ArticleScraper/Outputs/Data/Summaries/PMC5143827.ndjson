{"summary": "cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. 3 Ischemia is defined as an insufficient supply of the nutrient and oxygen to the cardiac muscle. atria, conduction system, valves, coronary vessels, ventricles, fibroblasts and myocytes are found. angiotensin II antagonist and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have cardioprotective effect by reducing the blood pressure and infarct size. lower concentration of angiotensinogen is found in the ventricles as compared to heart atria. angiotensin II leads to hypertension by increasing vasoconstriction and retention of fluid and sodium in the body. it is also responsible for stimulation of inflammatory mediators such as NAD(P)H oxidase, phospholipase A2 and JAK/STAT pathway. hypoxanthine is oxidized by xanthine oxidase which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the time of reperfusion, xanthine oxidase metabolizes the hypoxanthine to xanthine and forms uric acid that leads to the formation of huge amount of reactive oxygen species. phosphorylation decreases the level of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and elevates adenosine monophosphate (AMP) further hypoxanthine forms xanthine via xanthine dehydrogenase. inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase and formation of ionic homeostasis activates protease. angiotensinogen, Ang I, Ang II, ACE, ACE 2, angiotensin 1\u20137, angiotensin 1\u20139 and angiotensin 1\u20135 plays an important role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. angiotensin I (vasodilator) convert into angiotensin II (Ang II) via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) angiotensin regulates cardiac functions, blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and growth of cells. angiotensin (1\u20137) has anti-proliferative action on the vascular smooth muscles, cardiac muscles cells and improve endothelial functions. e aceturate also attenuates left ventricular remodeling, post-myocardial infarction and play a major role in the treatment of myocardial infarction. ACE2 activates the circulating endothelial progenitor cells in the blood which decreases the inflammatory cells and increases the cardiac progenitor cells in the region of peri-infarct cardiac muscles. ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril) as well as myocardial I/R injury increase the excessive expression of oxygen, sodium and calcium ions. in heart RAS, angiotensin-(1\u20137) is responsible for vasodilation and angiotensin II is for vasoconstriction. above evidence suggests that infarct size can be reduced by ACE inhibitors, ACE2 activators and angiotensin II antagonist."}
