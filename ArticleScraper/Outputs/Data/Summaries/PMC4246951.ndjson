{"summary": "mammalian protein LC3 becomes lipidated and membrane-associated upon induction of autophagy (27, 28) during infection with several different picornaviruses, including poliovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus B3 and foot-and-mouth disease virus (20, 29\u201332). to determine whether the induction of GFP-LC3 puncta by poliovirus infection was cell-autonomous or not. es the fluorescent protein DsRed fused to the C terminus of the nonstructural 2A protein (34) PV-DsRed grows more slowly than wild-type virus but retains the inserted sequences through multiple cycles of infection. the timing and location of infection of individual cells can be monitored upon accumulation of 2A-DsRed protein. loperamide and nicardipine are both FDA-approved Ca2+ channel blockers. both drugs inhibit calpains, thus stimulating autophagy. nicardipine and loperamide have advantages over rapamycin. cPVR mice express the human poliovirus receptor in an ICR background. cPVR mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 5 106 PFU of type 1 Mahoney virus. cPVR mice showed greater susceptibility to poliovirus growth and pathogenesis. ICR mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (CD155) under the control of the murine actin promoter (36) increased levels of LC3-II were observed in the calf muscle. the presence of loperamide greatly increased the rate of paralysis. loperamide increased plaque size under these conditions. no loperamide effect was observed upon LC3 knockdown. loperamide stimulates poliovirus spread via its effect on autophagy pathway. cell viability during a 48-h time course was imaged by DIC microscopy. we could ask whether target cells were infected before the adjacent donor cell lost its integrity. time-lapse fluorescence microscopy revealed the time courses of many individual cells following infection of an Huh7-A-1 monolayer. single cell images taken from Movie S7 track the onset of the DsRed fluorescence that indicates viral infection (Top), the SYTOX staining that monitors cell death (Middle) and the DIC images that identify all cells and visualize the onset of membrane rupture (Bottom). value of 2 h is a clear example of functional nonlytic viral spread. we screened single cells that were infected with PV-DsRed in the absence or presence of loperamide or nicardipine. the autophagy pathway or the process itself increased the frequency of these unambiguous cases. time-lapse microscopy showed that the percentage of GFP-LC3\u2013expressing cells increased over time in the infected but not the uninfected cells. to determine whether the induction of GFP-LC3 puncta by poliovirus infection was cell-autonomous or not, we used an engineered poliovirus genome that expresses the fluorescent protein DsRed. loperamide and nicardipine have advantages over rapamycin because they do not inhibit protein translation or affect the cell cycle. loperamide and nicardipine have advantages over rapamycin because they do not inhibit protein translation. loperamide and nicardipine did not affect the accumulation of intracellular RNA. cPVR mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 5 106 PFU of type 1 Mahoney virus. the titers of poliovirus in inoculated calf muscles of cPVR mice were determined 4 d after infection with 3 105 PFU of virus. cPVR mice express the poliovirus receptor in a C57BL/6 background and show greater susceptibility to poliovirus growth. the few autophagy inhibitors currently available are limited for use in long-term experiments and in animals by their toxicity (39). we used pools of siRNA that target both isoforms of the critical autophagy protein LC3 (20) and the extent of LC3 depletion was determined by immunoblotting. in 15 randomly chosen plaques from control and LC3 siRNA-treated cells with and without 5 M loperamide 36 h postinfection. Statistical significance was determined using Student t test. n = 15. *P 0.05; **P 0.01. Single cell analysis identifies nonlytic spread events. single-cell analysis of cell viability reveals nonlytic spread of poliovirus infection. cells infected by PV-DsRed in the first infectious cycle showed red fluorescence beginning at an average of 10 h postinfection, SYTOX Blue staining beginning at an average of 15 h postinfection, and membrane rupture by DIC microscopy beginning at 16 h. the relative timing of death of the donor cell and detectable infection of the target cell (t) was quantified for individual cell pairs by setting the time of DsRed fluorescence in the target to zero and then subtracting the time of death of the donor. poliovirus infection is highly lytic in most cells in tissue culture. poliomyelitis in vivo is caused by the destruction of neurons in the CNS. this is likely to be a property of other nonenveloped viruses, such as hepatitis A. viral components 2BC and 3A are sufficient to induce double-membraned vesicles. fusion of a double-membraned vesicle with the plasma membrane should release an exosome-like vesicle. for viral spread to occur, the exosome-like vesicle would need to be unstable or contain infectious RNA. autophagy and other mechanisms of cytoplasmic transfer between living cells are likely to provide targets for halting the spread of toxic assemblages. a 1:1 DMEM:agarose overlay supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) CO2 was added to preclude long-distance viral spread. analysis of time-lapse movies was done in MatLab using a custom graphical user interface. Statistical significance was determined using linear regression to compare slopes, the Student t test to compare means, and the log-rank test for survival curves. analysis of time-lapse movies was done in MatLab using a custom graphical user interface.
