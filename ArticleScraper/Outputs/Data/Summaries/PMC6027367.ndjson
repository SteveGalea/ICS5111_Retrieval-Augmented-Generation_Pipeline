{"summary": "NF-B is an inducible transcription factor that displays low constitutive background activity. it can be strongly induced by a variety of agents which increase the nuclear concentration of the DNA-binding subunits. the NF-B system acts as a general stress sensor that is activated by a multitude of adverse conditions. ER stress sensors ER stress is recognized by three sensors that are inserted into the ER membrane. PERK and IRE1 share similar lumenal parts and possess cytosolic ser/thr kinase domains. PERK and IRE1 share similar lumenal parts and possess similar lumenal parts. in non-stressed cells, the major ER chaperone binding-immunoglobulin protein (BIP) binds to the ER-oriented parts of PERK and IRE1 and keeps them in a monomeric inactive state. increased binding of BIP/GRP78 to misfolded proteins relieves both PERK and IRE1 and facilitates activation by dimerization. eIF2-GTP is hydrolyzed, releasing eIF2-GDP from the ribosome. the resulting drop in eIF2-GTP levels then suppresses general translation. eIF2 is mediated by one of the four kinases. PP1 activity is under control of the constitutive repressor of eIF2 phosphorylation, CReP (encoded by PPP1R15b) the four eIF2 kinases are typically activated by infection (double stranded RNA, PKR), amino acid starvation (GCN2) or by unfolded proteins in the ER (PERK) the eIF2 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle is often disrupted thapsigargin activates p65/p50 NF-B subunits. same effect was seen in thapsigargin-treated Mefs subjected to leucine starvation or exposed to UV light. this effect was abolished in mefs lacking PERK or expressing an eIF2 mutant. the phospho-eIF2-dependent regulation of p65 by thapsigargin was confirmed by Deng and coworkers. they constructed a protein consisting of the cytoplasmic PERK kinase domain fused to a protein module that allowed conditional tethering (or oligomerization) of the PERK domains by a bivalent cell permeable compound. the paradigm of ER stress-mediated suppression of constitutive IB protein synthesis is still suggested to be the dominant mechanism of ER\u2013NF-B crosstalk. the regulation of IB protein levels is key to NF-B activation, as well as the early observation that the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) is sufficient for NF-B activation. the level of free IB is severely reduced in cells lacking the p105, c-REL and p65 (RELA) subunits. the half-life of free IB ranges from 10 min to 20 min. that of the NF-B-bound IB is more stable, ranging from 8 h to 10 h. stress on IB protein stability and the stoichiometry of free versus bound IB in physiological and pathophysiological situations. ER stress also modulates (or requires) critical upstream regulators of the NF-B pathway. IRE1-dependent mechanism seems to cooperate with the PERK pathway. NF-B activity does not depend on IKK, but rather on IKK. thapsigargin-induced NF-B decay is abrogated in cells reconstituted with a mutant of IKK. IRE1-dependent regulation of basal IKK activity is necessary for effective activation of NF-B by PERK [64]. IRE1-dependent regulation of basal IKK activity is necessary for effective activation of NF-B by PERK. IRE1 and PERK are kept inactive by binding to the chaperone BIP/GRP78 within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. different classes of chemical stressors increase protein load in the ER. thapsigargin strongly induces the protein levels of the transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4 and CHOP. transcriptional induction occurs by a unique mechanism that allows preferential translation from downstream open reading frames (ORFs) of ATF4 or CHOP. the effect is absent in PERK-deficient cells, while during amino acid starvation, GCN2 is employed for their expression. thapsigargin-inducible expression of CHOP and ATF4 unchanged in p65-deficient cells. thapsigargin-induced expression of BIP/GRP78 is normal in PERK-deficient cells suggesting a new direct link from NF-B subunits to ER stress target genes. ATF3 is required for recruitment of HDAC1 and negative regulation of eleven LPS-target genes. this was confirmed by a systems biology approach showing that ATF3 attenuated LPS-induced IL6 as part of a regulatory circuit. depletion of ATF3 or C/EBP disrupted the kinetics and amplitude of LPS-induced IL6 expression. we interrogated this data set for factors that may represent the crosstalk of ER stress with (NF-B-dependent) immunoregulatory genes. tunicamycin also regulates multiple genes with annotated functions in immune responses. 58 genes that have a documented role in regulation of the NF-B signaling pathway, including three IBs, (IB, IBe, IBz) crosstalk between ER stress transcription factors is not necessarily always negative or repressive. in physiological settings, this crosstalk between ER stress transcription factors is not necessarily always negative or repressive. two hundred and thirty-two of these factors were expressed in all conditions. the right color map categorizes the effects of loss of CHOP or ATF on basal and Tm-inducible expression of the NF-B components. this compound suppressed a range of human xenograft tumors and inhibited PERK autophosphorylation, eIF2 phosphorylation and the induction of UPR target genes in cell lines and tumors. however, the inhibitor was also cytotoxic to the exocrine/endocrine pancreas tissues in non-tumor controls consistent with the results from PERK-deficient mice. salubrinal suppressed eIF2 dephosphorylation through the GADD34/PP1 and CReP/PP1 complexes. this effect was not abrogated in cells with siRNA-mediated suppression of eIF2. the same effect was seen with guanabenz, another PP1 inhibitor. two cytosolic sensors of bacterial peptidoglycans suppressed IL-6 secretion. these two pathways can also be seen as a combinatorial system of ten transcription factors that cooperate to shape gene activation patterns and protein folding capacities. repression of hundreds of genes that determine the balance between metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes and the extent of apoptosis and autophagy or repair of cell damage and survival."}
