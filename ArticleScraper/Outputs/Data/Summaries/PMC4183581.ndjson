{"summary": "bats are natural reservoirs of some of the most deadly zoonotic viruses. rabies virus, Ebola virus, Henipaviruses, and SARS coronavirus. new subtypes of IAV are introduced into the human population by zoonosis. the discovery of putative bat-influenza viruses expands the known host species reservoirs that may serve as a source of novel viruses. the inability to culture infectious viruses is the major hurdle to confirm the existence of these novel influenza viruses. we synthesized the complete genome of A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H17N10) and cloned it into reverse genetics plasmids to rescue this putative bat-influenza virus (Bat09) supernatants were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs and cell lines derived from many species (MDCK), mink (Mv1-Lu), swine (ST), African green monkey (Vero reassortants from reassortants from a recombinant recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 couldn't be rescued following transfection. the three reassortant genotypes containing the Bat09 internal protein vRNAs couldn't be rescued following transfection. reassortant bat09:mH1mN1 replicated efficiently in mouse lungs. virulence of bat09:mH1mN1 was close to that of the PR8 virus. histopathological analysis showed that the bat09:mH1mN1 virus caused typical influenza-like lesions characterized by a varying degree of broncho-alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis. peribronchiolar and perivascular areas were infiltrated by moderate numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells. virulence of the bat09:mH1mN1 in mice could partly result from the H1 and N1 of the mouse adapted PR8 virus. both viruses were inoculated into mice to compare the morbidity (weight loss), mortality and virus replication at various times post inoculation. the bat influenza internal protein vRNAs do support replication of the modified viruses (Bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat09:mH3mN2) in vitro, in ovo, and in the mouse lungs. the slightly lower replication efficiency and pathogenicity of those two viruses compared to the corresponding PR8 and TX98 viruses could be ascribable. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 3105 TCID50 of each virus. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 3104 TCID50 of each virus. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 3104 TCID50 of each virus. luciferase reporter mediated assay to quantitate NS1 protein inhibition effects on interferon- promoter activation. truncation of NS1 protein decreased its ability to inhibit interferon- production. truncation of NS1 protein decreased its ability to inhibit interferon- production. inversely correlated with type I interferon induced by influenza virus. truncation of the Bat09-NS1 modestly reduced VSV replication. truncation of the PR8-NS1 severely inhibited VSV replication. truncation (NS1-128, NS1-73) of the Bat09 NS1 didn't dramatically impact the viruses' ability to antagonize the host innate response, or replicate and cause disease in mice. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 104 TCID50 of each virus. truncation (NS1-128, NS1-73) of the Bat09 NS1 didn't dramatically impact the viruses' ability to antagonize the host asparagine (N) 701 in the PB2 protein is a mammalian-signature in IAVs. it decreased virus titers in the lungs, morbidity (minor weight loss) and resulted in 100% survival. introducing another virulence marker PB2-E158G into the wild type PB2 dramatically increased the pathogenicity of the bat09 virus (100% mortality) sporadic nucleotide polymorphisms (10% - 44%) were detected in the viral genomes. the high genetic stability of the modified Bat09 viruses in mice is consistent with the notion that the bat influenza viruses are mammalian viruses that have been evolving and adapting in the bats. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 103 TCID50 of each virus. the PB2-627S showed intermediate polymerase activity compared to the PB2-627K and PB2-627E/K mutants. a luciferase mediated mini-genome replication assay was performed at 33\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 39\u00b0C by co-transfecting 293T cells with Bat09 PB2. the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from bat-influenza, IAVs, and IBVs generally recognize and transcribe their cognate vRNAs more efficiently than non-cognate vRNAs. most RdRp combinations (PB2, PB1, PA) between bat-influenza and IAVs nearly abolished the polymerase activity in this very sensitive mini-genome reporter assay. pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc and pPolI-FluB-NS-Luc were used for compatibility test. we couldn't generate any reassortant viruses using reverse genetics between Bat09:mH1mN1 and PR8 that contain partly compatible RdRp components. instead, the PR8-M segment could unidirectionally substitute for the Bat09-M segment. pols* NP M NS HA,NA Rescue** 1 Bat

in Table 1. reassortant bat09:PR8-H1N1 virus may result from compounding the low efficiency of packaging for each of the wild type PR8-HA and PR8-NA vRNAs into the bat-influenza backbone. the mN1 can also reassort with the other seven segments from PR8, even when many silent substitutions (ss) were introduced into the N1 coding regions. reassortants between a modified bat-influenza virus and a modified bat-influenza virus were not detected. reassortment between the two parental viruses was not detected. reassortment between the two modified bat viruses was not detected. classical co-infection of the bat-influenza virus in MDCK cells readily generated reassortant progeny viruses with various genotypes. some were apparently preferentially selected (e.g., Bat10:Bat09-NS reassortant, Table S2) Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat10 H17ps-H1ss N10ps-N1ss ++++ 8 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 Bat09 H18ps-H1ss N11ps-N1ss +++ 12 Bat09 Bat10 Bat10 Bat10 Bat10 Bat10 Bat10

particles in the original bat specimens is a potential factor in the inability to isolate/culture bat-influenza. the mH1 contains PR8-HA coding region and Bat09-HA packaging region. the mN1 was constructed using the same strategy. previous biochemical and structural studies with purified proteins indicate that the HA doesn't bind to canonical sialic acid receptors of influenza viruses. bat-influenza virus could be generated and replicated efficiently in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo. modified HA vRNA (mH1) contained protein coding region from PR8-H1 flanked by putative cis-acting terminal packaging signals from Bat09. reassortant bat09:mH1mN1 formed particles similar to that of bat09. a mouse study was performed using the mouse adapted PR8 IAV as a positive control. the virulence of Bat09:mH1mN1 was close to that of the PR8 virus (100% mortality) the virulence of the virus was close to that of the PR8 virus. nucleotide polymorphisms were detected at sporadic loci throughout the Bat09 vRNAs. each lung sample only had one such polymorphism on average. serial passage of this virus in mice may identify mutations in the Bat09 backbone critical to replication/pathogenesis in mice. the rescued bat09:mH3mN2 virus replicated to peak titers close to that of TX98. both viruses were inoculated into mice to compare the morbidity (weight loss), mortality and virus replication at various times post inoculation. all mice survived infection and both viruses caused little effect on weight gain as compared to mock inoculated animals. the putative packaging regions from Bat09-HA and all start codons in the Bat09-HA 5\u2032 packaging region were mutated. the mN1 PR8-NA coding region was flanked by the putative packaging regions from Bat09-NA and all start codons in the Bat09-NA 5\u2032 packaging region were mutated. the NS1 protein of IAVs is critical for pathogenicity of many strains because of its ability to antagonize the host interferon response. we expressed the proteins ectopically in human HEK-293T and then infected them with Sendai virus to stimulate the innate immune response. truncation of the NS1 truncated viruses (Bat09:mH1mN1ss-NS1-128 and Bat09:mH1mN1ss-NS1-73) inhibited VSV replication (i.e., luciferase expression) the truncation mutants had 100\u20131000 fold lower titers than PR8. truncated NS1 in PR8 (PR8-NS1-126), recombinant bat-influenza viruses with truncated NS1 genes replicated efficiently in the lungs. truncation (NS1-128, NS1-73) of the Bat09 NS1 didn't dramatically impact the viruses' ability to antagonize the host innate response. truncated bat09:mH1mN1ss-128 and bat09:mH1mN1ss-73 compared to PR8-NS1-126. pathogenesis of modified bat09 virus can be manipulated by amino acid substitutions at residues important in virulence of IAVs. introducing the PB2-E158G (Bat-158G) into the wild type PB2 resulted the most significant increase of virus replication, morbidity, and mortality. all viruses collected from mouse lungs were deep sequenced to confirm the stability of the engineered mutations. luciferase-mediated mini-genome replication assay performed at 33\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 39\u00b0C by co-transfecting 293T cells with Bat09 PB2 (WT or mutant), PB1, PA, NP, and a vRNA-like luciferase reporter. luciferase activity was determined to represent the viral polymerase activity. coding vRNAs of bat-influenza don't efficiently reassort with IAV or IBV Reassortment of IAVs is important in the evolution of IAVs and generation of panzootic and pandemic strains. efficient replication of vRNAs from different parental viruses necessitated an assessment of reassortment potential. vRNA reporters used were pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc and pPolI-FluA-NS-Luc. for compatibility test between Bat09 and IBV the vRNA reporters were an equal ratio of pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc and pPolI-FluA-NS-Luc. the PR8-M segment could unidirectionally substitute for the Bat09-M segment.

PB2-627S has intermediate polymerase activity compared to PB2-627E and PB2-627K in mammalian cells. mini-genome replication studies showed PB1, PB2, PA and NS vRNAs of bat-influenza don't efficiently reassort with the IAV or IBV. both IAV and IBV RdRp have 50\u201360% reduction in activity with the bat-influenza mini-genome. the M segment is the most highly conserved gene among influenza A and B viruses. we found that the PR8-M segment could substitute for the Bat09-M segment. however, putative packaging signal swapping of the NP and NS segments didn't overcome reassortment defects. bat influenza viruses (Bat09, Bat10) could pose a pandemic threat if their HA and NA acquire mutations that impart binding to canonical influenza virus receptors and rescuing the NA for neuraminidase activity. the restriction on reassortment appears to result from multiple levels of incompatibility that are either additive or synergistic. synthetic genomics/reverse genetics strategy employed provides infinite supply of wild type bat-influenza particles that can be used to identify permissive cells or animals. the availability of our modified bat-influenza virus opens many other avenues of investigation and discovery. all animal studies were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility. each mouse was anesthetized by inhaling 4% isoflurane. mice were euthanized if more than 25% of weight was lost. 472 oligonucleotides of 56\u201360 bases in length were designed for enzymatic assembly of the eight segments. the assembly and error correction processes were performed as recently described [32], [33], modified with increased time at all extension steps (from 72\u00b0C for 1 min to 72\u00b0C for 2 min) the synthesized segments were cloned into the modified bidirectional influenza reverse genetics vectors pBZ66A12 [34] and transformed into Stella competent E. the mH1ss and mN1ss are thus more appropriate than the mH1 and mN1ss to assess the HA and NA packaging signal compatibility between Bat09 and PR8. the batps-PR8-NP, PR8ps-Bat-NP, Batps-PR8-NS, and PR8ps-Bat-NP constructs were constructed similarly and diagramed in Fig. S2D. the transfection mixture was transferred to 90% confluent 293T/MDCK cell monolayers in a 35-mm tissue culture dish. the transfection supernatant was replaced with 3 ml of Opti-Mem I medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V (Life Technologies), 3 g/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) a total of thirty-five ml of transfected 293T cell supernatants for each virus were collected at 48 hours post transfection and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes. the supernatant was loaded on 30% (w/v) sucrose in centrifuge tubes and was concentrated at 27,000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove the cell debris. the fixed particles were dissolved in 100 l of water and the grid was dried and stained with negative staining the cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 TCID50/cell with the Bat09:mH1mN1 virus or PR8 virus. supernatants were collected at 1, 2, and 3 days post inoculation. a modified multi-segment RT-PCR [35], [36] was used to amplify influenza-specific segments. the only modification was the primers used for amplification were changed to match bat influenza termini. the primers used were Uni12/Inf-5G (5\u2032-GGGGGGGGAGCAGAAG-3\u2032) and Uni13/Inf-1 (5\u2032-CGGGTTATTAGTAGAAACAAGG-3\u2032) 293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with empty vector (200 ng) or increasing amounts of wild type (WT) or carboxyl terminal truncated NS1 from Bat09 and PR8. co-transfected were 200 ng of an IFN--promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pIFN-Luc) and 20 ng of a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase ( firefly luciferase expression was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) at 4 hpi with VSV-Luciferase. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2 (WT or mutant), PB1, PA, NP, and a pPol1-FluA-NS-Luc. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2, PB1, PA, and a pPol1-NS-Luc reporter plasmid, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. for each combination of RNP and pPol1-Bat-NS-Luc, three independent replicates were conducted. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2, PB1, PA, NP (from Bat09 or B/Russia/1969), 0.1 g of pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc plasmid and 0.1 g of pPolI-FluA-NS-Luc. for compatibility test between Bat09 and IAVs, 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2, luciferase activity of all-Bat09-combination was set at 100%. 98 female mice aged 6 to 7 weeks were randomly allocated to 7 groups. six mice were intranasally inoculated with 103 TCID50 of each virus. all control mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 L fresh MEM. three control mice were necropsied at 3 and 5 dpi. the remaining mice were kept until the end of the animal study. total of 70 female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks randomly allocated to 5 groups (14 mice/group) to determine virus replication, six mice were intranasally inoculated with 104 TCID50 of each virus. three mice from each group were killed on both 3 and 5 day post-inoculation (dpi) bloods were collected from each mouse to isolate serum for the HI assay at 14 dpi. both modified bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses showed similar replication kinetics in MDCK cells, whereas the PR8 replicated more efficiently. mL TPCK-trypsin was added on cells to select single virus from co-infected supernatants. the purified single virus (plaque) was amplified for further analysis. specific RT-PCR was used to differentiate internal genes from bat09:mH1mN1, bat10:mH1mN1 and PR8 viruses. one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of differences observed. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD). biosafety and ethics statement The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee at Kansas State University. cells Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells, mouse rectum epithelial carcinoma (CMT-93) cells, and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) sequenced plasmids were pBZ146A1 (PB2), pBZ147A11 (PB1), pBZ148A20 (PA), pBZ149A30 (HA), pBZ151A36 (NA), pBZ152A42 (M) and pBZ153A45 (NS) the whole process only took seven days to complete. the resulting plasmids (pHW-H18-PB2, pHW-H18-PB1, pHW-H18-PA, pHW-H18-PA, pHW-H18-HA, pHW-H18-NP, pHW-H18-NA, pHW-H18-M and pHW-H18-NS) were confirmed by sequencing. the whole process took more than one month. chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies) supernatant (P1) was collected at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi), or when severe cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. a total of thirty-five ml of transfected 293T cell supernatants for each virus were collected at 48 hours post transfection. the cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 TCID50/cell with the Bat09:mH1mN1 virus or PR8 virus (Bat09:mH3mN2 virus or TX98 virus) and incubated at 37\u00b0C. six of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with bat09:mH1mN1 or PR8 at 103 TCID50/egg. allantoic fluid was collected from each egg and titrated individually. primers used for amplification were changed to match bat influenza termini. sample prep kit (Illumina, Inc.) was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc.) the protocol requires observing the same SNP, at a statistically significant level, in both sequencing directions. if the p-values calculated in each direction are less than the Bonferroni-corrected significance level, then the SNP call is accepted. ase reporter plasmid (pIFN-Luc) and 20 ng of a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) at 18 hours post transfection, cells were infected with Sendai virus to induce the IFN- promoter. luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2 (WT or mutant), PB1, PA, NP, and a pPol1-FluA-NS-Luc. as a control for transfection efficiency, 0.02 g of the Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was also co-transfected. pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc (firefly luciferase flanked by Bat09 NS non-coding regions), pPol1-FluA-NS-Luc, and pPolI-FluB-NS-Luc (firefly luciferase flanked by B/Russia/1969 NS non-coding regions) for each combination of RNP and pPolI-NS-Luc reporter, three independent replicates were conducted. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 g each of the PB2, PB1, PA, NP (from Bat09 or IAV), 0.1 g of pPolI-Bat-NS-Luc plasmid and 0.1 g of pPolI-FluA-NS-Luc. for compatibility test between Bat09 and IBV, 0.2 g each of the PB2, PB1, PA, NP (from Bat09 or another influenza virus total of 98 female mice aged 6 to 7 weeks randomly allocated to 7 groups. six mice were intranasally inoculated with 103 TCID50 of each virus. three mice from each group were euthanized on both 3 and 5 day post-inoculation. the homogenate was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes. the supernatant was titrated by infecting MDCK cells in 96-well plates. the lungs were examined microscopically for the percentage of the lung involved and for the histopathologic changes seen. another 8 mice from each group were intranasally inoculated with 105 TCID50 of each virus in 50 L MEM medium. the mice were monitored body weights and general health status daily. after the onset of disease, the general health status was observed twice per day. both modified bat09:mH1mN1 and Bat10:mH1mN1 viruses showed similar replication kinetics in MDCK cells. the cells were infected with each virus at MOI of 1 and with the Bat09:mH1mN1 at MOI of 4. after 1 hour of incubation, the supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with fresh MEM for 10 times. RNAs were extracted from each amplified single virus using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) cDNA was synthesized by using the bat universal 12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCAGG-3\u2032) and the bat universal 12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCAGG-3\u2032) for the samples from the co-infection study with bat09:mH1mN1 and PR8 viruses. mH1ss was constructed by introducing 64 of silent substitutions into the coding region of mH1 to disrupt the remaining packaging signals in the PR8-HA coding region. the mH1ss was referred as H17ps-H1ss and the mN1ss was referred as N10ps-N1ss in Table 5. pPol1-Bat-NS-Luc, pPol1-FluA-NS-Luc, and pPol1-FluB-NS-Luc reporter genes. figure S3 Compatibility between RNPs and viral RNA promoters from different viruses."}
