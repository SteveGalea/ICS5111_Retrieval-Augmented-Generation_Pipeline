{"summary": "children in this observational study were enrolled from 145 nursery schools in Fukuoka City, japan. children in the exposure group were instructed to gargle at least once a day. endpoints were incidence of fever during the daytime and incidence of sickness absence. health authorities have officially recommended gargling to prevent respiratory infections for more than 90 years. a recent randomized controlled study in japan showed that gargling with tap water inhibited the onset of upper respiratory tract infections among adults. another study suggested that gargling among adults had beneficial economic effects. d questionnaire asked about sex, age, body temperature (if feverish), dates of absence, reasons for absence (if absent), size and location of school, and whether they gargled once or more a day at nursery school. a classroom teacher instructed children to gargle at all scheduled times and visually confirmed that they had gargled. the study was conducted by the Joint Committee for Preschool Children\u2019s Health of the Fukuoka City Medical Association from January through February 2006. the eligible facilities were all 166 mayor-authorized nursery schools in Fukuoka City, Japan, of which 145 agreed to join this study. the inclusion criterion was attendance at any participating schools. a child was absent, the reason for absence was obtained from the children\u2019s parents. the primary study endpoint was incidence of fever during the daytime. the differences between gargling agents for each endpoint was tested with SAS. x male 8207 (80.8%) 1945 (19.2%) 0.126 female 7652 (81.0%) 1791 (19.0%) Size of school (number of children) 139 3931 (80.6%) 946 (19.4%) 0.001 139\u2013168 3930 (78.4%) 1086 (21.7%) 169\u2013224 3800 (78.5%) 1042 (21.5%) 225\u2013358 4198 (86.4%) 662 (13.6%) Location of school (ward) Higashi 3844 (80.2%) 9 gargling non-gargling (total: 391 900 person-days) (317 180 person-days) (74 720 person-days) P value Fever onset Yes 1095 (0.4%) 711 (1.0%) 0.001 No 316 085 (99.7%) 74 009 (99.1%) Sickness absence Yes 12 672 (4.0%) 3874 (5.2%) 0.001 No 304 508 (96.0%) 70 846 (94.8%) Data are gargling v. non-gargling 0.40 (0.24\u20130.68) 0.46 (0.26\u20130.80) Age 5 (n = 4521; g = 4474, ng = 47) Gargling v. non-gargling 0.39 (0.18\u20130.84) 0.41 (0.18\u20130.93) Age 6 (n = 3724; g = 3691, ng = 33) ling 0.65 (0.51\u20130.84) 0.68 (0.52\u20130.87) Age 5 (n = 4521; g = 4474, ng = 47) Gargling v. non-gargling 0.57 (0.37\u20130.88) 0.59 (0.38\u20130.92) Age 6 (n = 3724; g = 3691, ng = 33) gargling once or more a day was associated with lower onset of both febrile diseases during the daytime in children aged 2 to 6 years and sickness absences in children aged 4 to 6. the effect on prevention of febrile diseases differs by gargling agent. a plausible explanation is that chlorine is added to tap water by law. reducing oropharyngeal microbial flora by oral rinsing twice a day could have impeded aspiration of organisms that cause respiratory infections. tea catechin is a type of flavonoid in green tea and has antiviral and bacteriocidal effects. the effect of green tea in our study might thus be related to tea catechin. previous studies of gargling were relatively small. gargling is an inexpensive and straightforward hygienic measure for children. it is important for preschool children to perform infection control techniques in nursery school because infectious diseases tend to be spread in such environments."}
