{"summary": "it takes the virus about 80 days to spread over more than 30 countries. it takes about 100 days to cause about 800 deaths, a fatality ratio of about 1 in 10. the hardest hit regions are china, 11% (Taiwan), and 14% (Canada, Hong Kong) the day of their arrival in Hong Kong is the same, 21 February 2003. most of the early cases in Taiwan were imported from China and Hong Kong. since 11 July 2003, 325 cases have been discarded. majorities of cases occurred after 21 April 2003, and were associated with transmission in health-care settings [10]. all probable SARS patients were hospitalized [12], figures show. previous works studied the dynamics of the daily accumulated infected cases during the SARS outbreaks in Beijing, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. contacting the SARS virus alters people's daily activity. contacting the virus can be quantified by a combination of the fresh fear and the residual fear. the daily ridership exhibits a strong weekly cycle. the real-time reported probable SARS cases [29], [12] were used in this work. this data set contains a longer and more complete period of data (from late February to early July, 2003) than those of Hsieh et al. [11] and US CDC [10]. a dynamical model was developed to simulate day-to-day variations of the underground ridership in the periods before, during, and after the SARS epidemics. there exists a quick response of the underground ridership with respect to the daily reported SARS cases that made headlines almost everyday in the mass media during the 2003 SARS period. there exists a quick response of the underground ridership with respect to the daily reported SARS cases. we call as the fresh fear at day i. since gradually decays away from day i following Eqn. 4 for time, we call as the residual fear. therefore, at any day i, the total fear is a summation of a fresh fear plus the residual fears from previous days. we parameterize as (10) Here is a variable (the daily reported SARS cases) and L is a fixed parameter, representing the loss of underground ridership for each reported SARS case. this indicates that instantaneous passenger loss (fresh fear) on day dissipates exponentially to the following days with an -folding time of days. daily daily ridership shows a strong weekly cycle. a lower amount of people traveling on Wednesday (a short weekend), a weekly peak on Friday (before the long weekend), the lowest amount of people traveling on Saturday and Sunday are about the same. the daily probable cases are used in this work. the data used in this work is similar to the data shown in US CDC report [12]. this data set contains a longer and more complete period of data (from late February to early July, 2003) than those of Hsieh et al. [11] (data period 22 April - 4 June 2003), and US CDC [10] (data period late February - late May 2003) a dynamical model was developed to simulate daily variations of the underground ridership with respect to the daily reported SARS cases. the model variables and the external forcing that governs the time evolution of the model variables must be established so that the model is able to make prediction based on the change of external forcing. there exists a quick response of the underground ridership with respect to the daily reported SARS cases. we call as the fresh fear at day i. since gradually decays away from day i following Eqn. 4 for time, we call as the residual fear. at any day i, the total fear is a summation of a fresh fear plus the residual fears from previous days, (7). k is a fixed parameter, representing the loss of underground ridership for each reported SARS case. it can be determined that when (11) then (12) this indicates that instantaneous passenger loss (fresh fear) on day dissipates exponentially to the following days with an -folding time of days. in this work we also empirically determined k by comparing model results with daily underground ridership in 2003. the daily underground ridership can be modeled by the statistical average daily ridership of each year, indicating that the underground usage during normal days is very regular. however, there are days when the model and the actual underground ridership show big discrepancies. a big drop in ridership during the days 241\u2013271 in 2001 is due to the closure of two main lines of the underground system. underground flooding in 2001, caused by Typhoon Nari, resulted in a loss of about 80% daily ridership. the Chinese New Year holiday causes a loss of 60\u201370% daily ridership. the close of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods caused a loss of 50\u201380% daily ridership. the daily reported SARS cases started to decrease after 14 May (Julian day 134) on 15 June, the last daily reported single SARS case were made, and no more SARS cases were announced after that day. for about 111 days, people's life were shadowed by the daily announcement of new reported SARS cases. about 400,000 underground ridership per day occurs about 10 days after the peak of the reported SARS cases. the daily ridership in 2003 shows anomalously high loss of ridership from about day 60 to days 120\u2013150. about 50% of daily ridership was lost during peak of the 2003 SARS periods. instantaneous ridership loss rate (L) per reported SARS case, and the e-folding time () indicating the dissipation of the fresh fear to subsequent days. the larger the daily ridership loss rates L per reported SARS case, the deeper the reduction in the underground ridership will be resulted. but the time to return to the normal daily ridership is similar for different ridership loss rates after passing the peaks in the SARS cases. the underground daily ridership shows no distinctive drop from mid November 2002 to late February 2003. this indicates that the underground usage hasn't been directly impacted by reports of the SARS cases occurred abroad until the cases were reported domestically. a total of 131,132 people were quarantined during March\u2013July 2003 [12]. the level B quarantine, stared on 28 April, applied to those traveled from SARS-related areas. a total of 80,813 people were Level B quarantined for 10 days. there are days when the model and the actual underground ridership show big discrepancies. underground flooding in 2001, caused by Typhoon Nari, resulted in a loss of about 80% daily ridership. the Chinese New Year holiday causes a loss of 60\u201370% daily ridership. the increase in people taking the underground is due to the factors that the underground ridership was steadily growing. the daily reported SARS cases started to decrease after 14 May (Julian day 134) on 15 June, the last daily reported single SARS case were made, and no more SARS cases were announced after that day. for about 111 days, people's life were shadowed by the daily announcement of new reported SARS cases. the peak of the total fear is the loss of about 400,000 underground ridership per day, which occurs about 10 days after the peak of the daily reported SARS cases. the daily ridership in 2003 shows anomalously high loss of ridership from about day 60 to days 120\u2013150. about 50% of daily ridership was lost during peak of the 2003 SARS periods. instantaneous ridership loss rate (L) per reported SARS case, and the e-folding time () indicating the dissipation of the fresh fear to subsequent days. the larger the daily ridership loss rates L per reported SARS case, the deeper the reduction in the underground ridership will be resulted. but the impact on the loss of underground passengers will be limited to the days close to the peak of the reported SARS cases. the underground daily ridership shows no distinctive drop from mid November 2002 to late February 2003. the smallest value of these root mean square errors is found when = 28 and L = 1200. this indicates that the underground usage hasn't been directly impacted by reports of the SARS cases occurred abroad until the cases were reported domestically. a total of 50,319 people were Level A quarantined. the Level B quarantine, stared on 28 April, applied to those traveled from SARS-related areas. each reported SARS case results in an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership. the 2003 SARS epidemic does indeed make a turning point in people's behavior in Taiwan.
