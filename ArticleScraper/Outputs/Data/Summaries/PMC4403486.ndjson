{"summary": "Xenopus laevis tadpoles mount timely and robust type III interferon responses, which are overcome by FV3. these results challenge the idea of inefficient tadpole antiviral immunity. mutation of the ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) adjacent to the papain-like protease destabilizes enzymatic activity of the purified protein. mutant virus elicits immune responses that protect from challenge with wild-type virus."}
