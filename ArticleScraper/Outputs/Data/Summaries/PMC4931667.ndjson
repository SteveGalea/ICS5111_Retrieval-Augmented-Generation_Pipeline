{"summary": "vimentin is a major constitutive protein of intermediate-sized filaments present in the cytoskeleton. it is involved in maintaining cell shape and integrity, thereby supporting the anchorage of cell organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. vimentin is also expressed in cells undergoing physiological or pathological changes. the interaction is required for invasion of meningitic E. coli into BMEC cells. it involves vimentin phosphorylation and subsequent signaling via ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) vimentin (red lines) is involved in binding of the pathogen and subsequent invasion. a variety of intracellular vimentin-pathogen interactions is depicted. a number of bacterial factors have so far been identified. vimentin acts as a surface-attached receptor of AIEC. it was also shown that vimentin acts as a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)-interacting protein. this has led to the hypothesis that vimentin mediates interaction of NOD2 with the bacterial pathogen, resulting in its activation and a subsequent inflammatory response via NF-B signaling. phosphorylation of vimentin could thus inhibit signaling transduction events mediated or supported by phosphorylated vimentin. the presence of vimentin cages around Salmonella-containing vacuoles in the host cell cytosol maintains the vacuoles in close vicinity to the nucleus. a secreted chlamydial protease CPAF (Chlamydia protease-like activity factor), an important factor for the full replicative potential of C. trachomatis, can modify the vimentin scaffold [15,16] CPAF activity increases inclusion\u2019s flexibility and facilitates bacterial replication. CPAF inhibition leads to the loss of inclusion integrity, and eventually cell death. SpyA ADP-ribosylates target proteins, including actin and vimentin. the latter seems to be the preferred substrate of SpyA. the exact cellular consequences of SpyA in the course of a GAS infection are unclear. vimentin expression is significantly upregulated on the surface of mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected monocytes, compared with uninfected cells. vimentin is differentially phosphorylated by PKA/PKC in monocytes and macrophages, respectively, which may be linked to vimentin filament disassembly. a recent study has reported upregulation of vimentin in response to ROS in endothelial progenitor cells. the apparent cross-talk between ROS production and vimentin expression needs further investigations. the species Mycobacterium avium is an opportunistic pathogen. vimentin expression may stimulate P. acnes binding and invasion into the injured skin epithelium. vimentin can act as a virus receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and for Enterovirus 71 [32,33] pathogen binding and uptake is part of the defense system of these phagocytes. cytosolic vimentin is a component of the cytoskeleton. cytosolic vimentin has another role as a mediator of the innate immune response. vimentin can exert post-translational modifications of vimentin by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation or ADP-ribosylation. this also implies that the role of vimentin depends on its localization. success of the intracellular pathogen seems to depend, at least partly, on its ability to manipulate the vimentin network in order to suppress innate immunity."}
