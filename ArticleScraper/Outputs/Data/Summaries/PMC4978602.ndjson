IRF-1 deletion attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice. WT and IRF-1 KO mice were treated with vehicle or LPS (20 kg/mg) by IP injection. results are representative of three independent experiments. BALF indicates bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor 1; KO, knockout; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; WT, wild-type. arrowheads show positive AMs (n = 6/group, P 0.05 versus the WT/PBS group) results are representative of three independent experiments.

IRF-1 indicates interferon regulatory factor 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. the involvement of IRF-1 signaling in macrophages was examined directly. J744.A1 cells were transfected with IRF-1 shRNA, control lentivirus vector (NC shRNA), IRF-1 lentivirus (IRF-1 LV) and control lentivirus vector (NC LV) then J744.A1 cells were stimulated with or without LPS (500 ng/mL) for 5 h and ATP (5 mM) was added during the last hour of culture. nuclear and cytoplasmic protein in J744.A1 cells was confirmed by western blotting. transduction of J744.A1 cells with IRF-1 lentivirus vector resulted in significant caspase-1 activation (Fig. 7B, P 0.05; Fig. 6D, P 0.05) compared with the negative control in both LPS/ATP-treated and untreated groups. two milliliters of the supernatants were harvested and tested for levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. overexpression of IRF-1 in J744.A1 cells boosted expression of IL-18 (A), IL-1 (C) and HMGB1 (E) in the supernatants. we have investigated the role of IRF-1 in mediating AM pyroptosis. we found that tissue-derived alveolar macrophages exhibit less pyroptosis than their WT counterparts. overexpression of IRF-1 in J744.A1 cells alone is a sufficient stimulation to induce pyroptosis. caspase-1-mediated tissue damage is thought to require the pro-inflammatory caspase-1 substrates IL-1 and IL-18. the existence of another caspase-1-dependent mediator of endotoxemia, HMGB1, has been described. this suggests that IRF-1 could play a key role in pyroptosis-associated cytokines. LPS-induced pyroptosis in AMs is a process that is dependent on TLR4-mediated upregulation of IRF-1. our study provides a novel therapeutic approach to management of ALI/ARDS."}
