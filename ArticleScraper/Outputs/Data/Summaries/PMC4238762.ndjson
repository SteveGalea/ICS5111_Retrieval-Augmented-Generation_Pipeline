{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients of all ages. patients presented with fever, myalgia, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat and earache within five days of the symptom onset. multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed using the FTDRP 21 plus. reaction volume for each test was 25 L, made up of 10 L of nucleic acid and 15 L of buffer/enzyme mix. the median age of the entire cohort was seven years (range 1 month to 75 years) children under nine years of age accounted for 66.7% (108/162) of the samples analysed. all patients had recent ( 5 days) symptoms. 0 (0) PIV-1 2 (1.2) 0 (0) 2 (1.2) 1 (0.6) PIV-3 2 (1.2) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0.6) PIV-3 2 (1.2) 0 (0) 3 (1.8) 1 (0.6) PIV-4 NA NA 2 (1.2) 0 (0) hMPV A/B NA 4 (2.5) 1 (0.6) HAdV 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0.6) 0 (0) EV NA most of the samples positive for RSV (91.6%) and HRV (77%) were identified in infants. no virus was identified in subjects above 40 years old. all co-detections occurred in children under two years of age. viruses and/or bacteria n (%) RSV A/B + Inf A 1 (0.6) RSV A/B + HCoV-NL63 1 (0.6) RSV A/B + Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 (0.6) RSV A/B + S. pneumoniae + Staphylococcus aureus 1 (0.6) RSV A/B + Inf A + S. pneumoniae + Haemophilus influenzae 1 (0.6) HRV + P multiplex PCR assays have become an important tool for the identification of etiologic agents in ARIs. more than half of the study population were children under nine years of age, which is representative of the occurrence of ARIs in the community. the frequency of influenza virus infection observed in this study (15.4%) is consistent with previously published rates varying from 2-26% of ARI cases in studies in South, Southeast and Northeast Brazil. all viruses screened in this study were more frequently identified in children, with the exception of influenza viruses. at one year of age, 25-50% of children have antibodies against RSV. this is demonstrating the high frequency of this infection at a young age. the frequency of HBoV was 3.1% and all cases occurred in children under two years of age. co-detection increased the length of hospitalisation and the time of oxygen use in children with lower respiratory tract infections. all cases of co-detection observed in our study occurred in children under two years old, the age group in which ARI cases are more frequent. atypical bacteria (M. pneumoniae and C. pneumonia) were not detected in the studied population. in brazil and other countries, the respiratory virus surveillance programs use conventional diagnostic techniques, such as IIF. a large proportion of biological samples remain negative, even with clinical evidence of respiratory infection."}
