{"summary": "angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II, which mediates its effects via the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the opposing arm, ACE2 degrades Ang II to Ang 1-7, which is thought to exert beneficial effect via the mas receptor. ACE2 amino acid sequence shares 40% homology with the N-terminal catalytic domain of ACE. ACE2 is a type 1 membrane protein with the catalytic domain on the extracellular surface. ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase, and in vitro can catalyze cleavage of the C-terminal residue of the peptides Ang I, des-Arg-bradykinin, neurotensin 1\u201313, and Ang 1-7 has other actions of cardiovascular relevance including natriuresis, diuresis, inhibition of cell growth and anti-atherosclerotic effects. this review will discuss the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental models of primary and secondary arterial hypertension. it is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE2 balance may result in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure. control group References PRIMARY HYPERTENSION Genetic SHR WKY Cardiac ACE2 mRNA, protein and activity Zhong et al., 2004; Diez-Freire et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011 ACE2 protein in rostral ventrolateral medulla Yamazato et al., 2007 SHR + 8% salt diet SHR + salt-sensitive Dahl salt-resistant Cardiac ACE2 mRNA and protein Takeda et al., 2007 Transgenic models TGR(mREN2)27 SD Kidney (cortical and medullar) ACE2 mRNA, and kidney ACE2 activity Kamilic et al., 2010 mREN(2).

ACE2 maps to a defined quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome. gene for ACE2 maps to a defined quantitative locus for blood pressure. ACE2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of genetic hypertension. a subsequent study showed no change in cardiac ACE2 gene and activity in salt-loaded SHR compared to salt-resistant Sabra rats on a normal diet. the results with regard to regulation of tissue ACE2 in transgenic models of hypertension are mixed. transgenic mice overexpressing human renin and angiotensinogen did not change kidney ACE2 expression and activity. hypertension secondary to short term Ang II infusion (2 weeks) in SD rats resulted in decreased kidney cortical and medullary ACE2 protein (Prieto et al., 2011), while chronic Ang II infusion (4 weeks) in SD rats increased cardiac ACE2 expression with no change in kidney ACE2. renal ACE was significantly elevated, resulting in increased Ang II and reduced Ang 1-7 levels. ACE2 gene expression was reduced in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of SHR compared to WKY rats. ACE2 activity in the brain stem was observed in genetically hypertensive mice. ACE2 gene expression was reduced in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. in Ang II induced hypertension, reduced ACE2 gene and protein expression in the periventricular nucleus (PVN) was reported. adenoviral injection directly in the PVN reduced blood pressure. low-renin hypertension was associated with reduced ACE2 expression and activity in the hypothalamus and increased ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. ACE2 deficiency was associated with only a modest increase in blood pressure (Gurley et al., 2006; Tikellis et al., 2012) but enhanced susceptibility to Ang II-induced hypertension. other studies have shown no change in blood pressure in ACE2 knock-out (KO) mice compared to control C57BL/6. atRA increased cardiac and kidney levels of ACE2 in SHR, reduced blood pressure and attenuated myocardial damage. XNT infusion increased cardiac gene and protein ACE2 levels in SHR. chronic infusion reversed cardiac and renal fibrosis. administration of rhACE2 also improved Ang II induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. both rhACE2 and mouse recombinant ACE2 attenuated Ang II induced hypertension in mice, with no effect on blood pressure in normotensive mice. clinical studies of circulating ACE2 and hypertension ACE2 undergoes \u201cshedding\u201d from endothelial cells to release the catalytically active ectodomain into the circulation. this process involves the proteinase ADAM17 (Lambert et al., 2005, 2008), and results in soluble ACE2 that can be measured in human plasma. the results from the available studies suggest that plasma ACE2 activity is low in normal healthy volunteers. up to 67% of the variability in circulating ACE2 levels was explained by hereditable factors. a number of other studies suggest an association between ACE2 activity and blood pressure. in patients with type 1 diabetes, serum ACE2 activity was significantly higher in male compared to female patients. studies by Soro-Paavonen et al. (2012) and Roberts et al. (2013) show that plasma ACE2 activity varies according to gender. most published ACE2 activity studies have not taken gender into account in their analysis. study investigated orthostatic blood pressure responses in 3630 Chinese Han subjects. found no association with the rs2285666 SNP (fan et al., 2009). rs4646155 rs879922 Zhou and Yang, 2009 rs2285666 Chinese population of Han ethnicity Both Meta-analysis (5 case-control and 1 cross-sectional study) 7251:3800 Hypertension Yes Huang et al., 2012 rs1514283 Chinese population of Han ethnicity Both Meta-analysis (9 case-control and 1 cross-sectional study) Yes rs4646176 rs879922 Malard et al., 2013 rs2074192 Adolescents from 3 ethnicities. two meta-analyses of the rs2285666 SNP have been reported with conflicting results. one study had a combined total of 2528 Chinese Han subjects with hypertension. four ACE2 SNPs were not associated with hypertension (n = 152) or normotension (n = 193) in a small case-control study conducted in anglo-Celtic Australian subjects with hypertension (n = 152) or normotension (n = 193) four ACE2 SNPs were not associated with hypertension (Benjafield et al., 2004) but none were associated with systolic blood pressure variation. the ACE2 SNP rs2074192 minor A allele was associated with a lower baseline diastolic and diastolic blood pressure in European males. the rs233575 T allele was associated with a lower baseline diastolic and diastolic blood pressure after weight and height adjustment. ACE2 gene and responses to blood pressure treatment were influenced by both gender and ethnicity. there are no studies of ACE2 gene associations with blood pressure treatment responses in Caucasian populations. there are 17 studies that have examined ACE2 genetic associations with blood pressure and hypertension. males have higher circulating ACE2 activity than females. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
