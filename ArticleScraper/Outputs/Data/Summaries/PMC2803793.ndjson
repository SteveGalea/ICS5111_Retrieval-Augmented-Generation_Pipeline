{"summary": "sensitivity of RT-LAMP system was evaluated with prototype strains of enterovirus. sensitivity of RT-LAMP system was evaluated with prototype strains of enterovirus. 96 cells were identified by sequence analysis using a seminested PCR system. this RT-LAMP system would be useful for the direct detection of enterovirus from the stool extracts. the cell culture-based procedure is time-consuming. a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system seems to be a most promising method that meet the demands expected for the cell culture-based isolation procedure. the advantages of RT-LAMP system are: 1) minimum essential equipment is an isothermal heat bath (final results can be visibly observed by the increased turbidity)[5], 2) high sensitivity (detection limits of 0.01 PFU for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 0.1 3 primers (F, B, Loop B primers) were designed with conserved sequences between PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTRs. the structure is based on the model proposed by Pilipenko et al. enterovirus genomes are classified into PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTR. primers that have complete match for PV-like 5'NTR are presented as preferable and specific primers to PV-like 5'NTR. sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for enterovirus species examined. cell culture supernatant of the virus was RT-LAMP positive at dilution of 1:10,000,000. cell culture supernatant of cells infected with PV(Sabin) strains was RT-LAMP positive. RT-LAMP system showed a good correlation with cell culture-based isolation especially for PV, HEV-C, and HEV-A. the 5'NTR of these HEV-B isolates showed mixed genetic properties of PV-like 5'NTR and CBV-like 5'NTR. primer sets to detect PV-like 5'NTR according to conditions required for primer in RT-LAMP reaction. 2 primers were preferable (a complete match for PV-like 5'NTR near the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, FIP primer) to PV-like 5'NTR (Figure 2). enterovirus genomes are classified into PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTR. the nucleotides characteristic to PV-like 5'NTR are highlighted in boxes colored by gray. sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for enterovirus species by using cell culture supernatant of the virus without viral RNA extraction. the detection limit of echovirus 11 and EV71 strains was 17 CCID50 (28,000 copies of the viral genome) and 7.8 to 53 CCID50 (7,400 to 13,000 copies of the viral genome), respectively. we analyzed the sequence of HEV-B isolates (CAM2515 and CAM2549) that were positive for RT-LAMP, and for a HEV-C (CAM2730) and a PV2 strains that were negative for RT-LAMP. the 5'NTR of these HEV-B isolates showed mixed genetic properties of PV-like 5'NTR and CBV-like 5'NTR. cVDPVs with unknown nucleotide sequences in the 5'NTR were isolated. the sequences of primers we used might detect most of the cVDPVs or immunodeficient VDPVs. this nucleotide change was not observed for another cVDPV strain. detection of enteroviruses from stool samples showed only slightly lower positive rates for HEV-A and HEV-B compared to those for PV and other HEV-C. the relatively low positive rates of HEV-B among these virus species might depend on the designed specificity of RT-LAMP to PV-like 5'NTR. the net amount of viral RNA used in RT-LAMP reaction corresponds to that contained in 10 l of stool extract. for the isolation of PV, 200 l of stool extract is inoculated into the cells. there is 20-fold difference in the available viral RNA or the infectious units between the RT-LAMP system and the cell culture system. RT-LAMP system would be useful for a triage of overwhelming number of clinical samples. cells, viruses, and clinical samples RD cells were cultured as monolayers in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. viral genomic RNA was collected in 50 l of distilled water purified from 200 l of stool extracts. stocks of the primers were prepared in distilled water in concentrations as follows. RT-LAMP reaction was performed by using a RNA Amplification Kit (RT-LAMP) the species and serotypes of enterovirus isolates were determined by sequencing of the viral genome with a primer set for 2BC coding region (2A2+ and 2C-primers) all the clinical samples and virus isolates used in this study are appropriately anonymized. RT-LAMP reaction was performed at 60\u00b0C for 90 min. optical density at 650 nm was measured as the turbidity. authors declare that they have no competing interests. -emerging Infectious Diseases from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare."}
