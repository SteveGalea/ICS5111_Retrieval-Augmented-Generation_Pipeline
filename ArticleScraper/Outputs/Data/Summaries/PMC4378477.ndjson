{"summary": "dromedaries were maintained in a fenced enclosure with barns. by December 30, 9 of 11 sampled dromedaries were positive for viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR. the viruses isolated in November and December were genetically identical. group 4 comprised 3 workers in a camel abattoir in al Hasa, where 25\u201335 camels were slaughtered daily. group 5 comprised 146 people in the same (Al Hasa) region who were not exposed to camels in their professional work. none of the 191 human serum samples tested had serologic evidence of infection. studies of MERS-CoV RNA prevalence in dromedaries in the field or abattoirs have found rates of 0%\u201315% (by PCR) among adults and 35% among calves (1 study) (4,8\u201310) dromedaries are not a source of infection for humans. infections in dromedaries in settings such as abattoirs are regularly documented. the number of humans exposed to virus-infected animals must greatly exceed the number of humans with MERS-CoV infection."}
