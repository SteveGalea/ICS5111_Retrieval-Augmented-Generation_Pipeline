{"summary": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, 5\u2032-capped, single-stranded RNA virus of the Hepeviridae family. the virus is 7.2 kB in length and was recently discovered to be quasi-enveloped. the strains that infect humans are classified in the genus Orthohepevirus. genome contains 'X', 'Y', and 'hypervariable (HVR)' domains. genome contains 'X', 'Y', and 'hypervariable (HVR)' domains. genome contains domains encoded by ORFs 1\u20133. genomic RNA encoding ORFs 2 and 3 is transcribed from the subgenomic promoter (SgP) the capsid protein and HEV viroporin are translated from the subgenomic RNA. sequence homology of several domains emerged. motifs indicative of a methyltransferase domain were made early on. the genome is encoded by nucleotides 1\u2013979 of HEV ORF1. studies have shown that patients with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and acute liver failure (ALF) caused by HEV were infected with virus containing mutations in various domains of ORF1 including in the methyltransferase domain. mutations in this region can have pro- or antiviral effects. X/Macro and Y domains of HEV are, at this time of writing, enigmatic to say the least. the functions of the X and Y domains were initially deduced based on sequence alignment with other viruses [18] since then, several mechanistic studies have been performed. the HEV X domain shows high sequence homology to the active site of the coronavirus cellular X domain-associated macro domain protein/ADP ribose-1\u201d-monophosphatase (CoV Appr-1\u201d-pase), and mutations in the putative catalytic site of the HEV X domain at N809A, H812L, G816A, G816V, G817A, or G817V. silico analysis suggests a putative palmitoylation site at residues C336\u2013C337, and an alpha helix segment stretching from residues L410 to E416. mutating conserved residues C336A, C337A, and W413A within the Y domain of genotype 1 HEV causes viral non-viability in human hepatoma cells. a few studies have shed some light on the clinical relevance of the X and Y domains of HEV. one study analyzed HEV quasispecies in two groups of solid organ transplant patients. there was greater sequence heterogeneity in the HVR region of HEV. zymatic core N1348A, encoded by the virus, led to slightly reduced titers when introduced to mice. it did not induce liver disease and induced much lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 [40]. these findings may lead to further study of this domain in the context of human pathogenesis. a group used a baculovirus expression system to overcome the low yield of ORF1 protein expressed in cells during natural infection. they observed nine distinct protein species of ORF1 of genotype 1 of HEV appearing in a time-dependent manner upon expression in non-natural host insect cells. a cysteine protease inhibitor blocked this processing of the ORF1 polyprotein. a recent study found two conserved putative cleavage sites for cellular thrombin and one for cellular factor Xa within HEV ORF1. the factor Xa site was suggested within the PCP domain at amino acid 560, and the thrombin sites in X domain (between 846 and 862 depending on HEV genotype) and in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (between 1218 and 1235 depending on genotype) mutating the putative catalytic residue C483 failed to abolish this cleavage, leading the authors to express doubts regarding the presence of a functional PCP within ORF1 [49] the function of the putative protease domain is still as enigmatic as ever, and future studies will hopefully shed more unambiguous light on the functions of this region of the HEV replicase. the HVR is the primary region accounting for size differences in HEV genomes from different genotypes. the HVR is typically 70\u201372 amino acids in length for genotype 1 HEV, 68 amino acids for genotype 2 HEV, 80\u201386 amino acids for genotype 3 HEV, 84 aa for all genotype 4 HEVs, and 84 aa for avian HEV. HVR sequence divergence is >2-fold greater for HEV zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 than for human genotype 1, suggesting a potential association between sequence heterogeneity and the number of hosts. in vitro studies reveal that insertion of sequences in the HVR can expand the host range of HEV strains in vitro. the Kernow-C1-p6 strain is one of the most commonly used HEV strains in cell culture studies due to its robust replicative capacity. the S17 insertion has also been shown to expand the host range of several HEV strains in vitro, suggesting a potential role in host adaptation. the HEV helicase falls under superfamily 1, which possesses seven conserved motifs arranged in a co-linear fashion. motif VI is thought to bind nucleic acids due to the high number of basic residues, namely arginine. mutations in the helicase domain of HEV genotype 3 have varying effects on viral replication in a reporter replicon system expressing Renilla luciferase. other mutations in the helicase domain of HEV genotype 3 have varying effects on viral replication in a reporter replicon system expressing Renilla luciferase. the HEV RdRp spans nucleotides 1249\u20131671 (GenBank accession M73218). it is located downstream of the RNA helicase gene across all genotypes. the HEV RdRp contains a highly conserved GDD motif. in vitro studies have shown that the RdRp has the highest affinity for the 3\u2032 UTR of the sense strand, than for the 5\u2032 UTR of the antisense strand, and relatively lower affinity for SgP in the antisense strand. the HEV RdRp has also been shown to interact with several host and immune factors. in vitro studies show that HEV strains from genotypes 1 and 3 exhibit increased replication rates in the presence of miR-122 overexpression, as well as decreased replication when miR-122 is knocked out. a curious feature of the RdRp is that it contains multiple B cell epitopes (based on analysis of genotype 1 strains from patient isolates) in vitro studies of these mutations did not demonstrate increased replication fitness or resistance to ribavirin. ribavirin, the only existing treatment for chronic HEV infection, is a nucleoside analog that inhibits RdRp activity and is highly effective in certain patient subpopulations [81,83]. a similar mechanism is employed by other RNA viruses in the \u2018alphavirus-like\u2019 supergroup of RNA viruses. the experimentally validated domain required for capping stretches over half of ORF1, encompassing the methyltransferase, X domain, putative protease, Y domain, and HVR domains, terminating within the helicase domain [18,20]. the single point mutation H105R led to a decrease in viremia, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic target in the future [28]. a clinical study found six amino acid substitutions within ORF1 that were significantly associated with fulminant hepatic failure caused by HEV genotype 1. one of these was located within the methyltransferase domain, while five were located within the region expressed in the study that identified the capping enzyme activity of ORF1 amino acids 1\u201397 a protein of 110 kDa possesses methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activity. this protein allows for the transfer of a methyl group to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), giving m7-GTP, which is then covalently coupled to the 5\u2032 end of the HEV genome. a similar mechanism is employed by other (+)-sense RNA viruses in the \u2018alphavirus-like\u2019 supergroup of one study found that the mutations in the methyltransferase domain of genotype 1 HEV led to an increase in viral load. the single point mutation H105R led to a decrease in viremia, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic target in the future [28] another clinical study found six amino acid substitutions within ORF1 that were significantly associated with fulminant hepatic failure. the HEV X domain is also known as the \u2018macro domain\u2019 because it exhibits weak sequence homology to human macro domain-containing proteins. it is also known as the \u2018macro domain\u2019 because it exhibits weak sequence homology to human macro domain-containing proteins, which are ADP ribose-binding molecules. a yeast two-hybrid study suggests that the HEV X domain binds the ORF1 methyltransferase at its N-terminus at amino acids 30\u201390, which includes the methyltransferase catalytic pocket. the X domain also binds ORF3 protein at its N-terminal 35 amino acids and C-terminal amino acids 63\u2013123, which are conserved residues across all HEV genotypes. mutating conserved residues C336A, C337A, and W413A within the Y domain of genotype 1 HEV causes viral non-viability in human hepatoma cells. these motifs lie within predicted RNA stem loops, and non-viability is thought to occur due to a disruption in the RNA secondary structure. methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities of an encoded capping enzyme possess a conserve EV and within the X domain in the group that developed chronic infections compared to the group who cleared in infection. this suggests a role in the severity of pathogenesis dictated by the composition of these regions. the relevance of these findings in the context of pathogenesis of HEV is still under investigation. the functions of the X and Y domains were initially deduced based on sequence alignments with other viruses [18] since then, several mechanistic studies have been performed, elucidating the importance of these regions in the viral lifecycle. the HEV X domain is also known as the \u2018macro domain\u2019 because it exhibits weak sequence homology. high sequence homology to the active site of the coronavirus (CoV) cellular X domain-associated macro domain protein/ADP ribose-1\u201d-monophosphatase (CoV Appr-1\u201d-pase) mutations in the putative catalytic site of the HEV X domain at N809A, H812L, G816A, G816V, G817A, or G817V severely reduce or completely abrogate viral silico analysis suggests a putative palmitoylation site at residues C336\u2013C337, and an alpha helix segment stretching from residues L410 to E416. mutating conserved residues C336A, C337A, and W413A within the Y domain of genotype 1 HEV causes viral non-viability in human hepatoma cells. a study analyzed HEV quasispecies in two groups of solid organ transplant patients. one group established chronicity and the other cleared the infection. there was greater sequence heterogeneity in the HVR region of HEV and within the X domain in the group that developed chronic infections. the region was first identified as a putative protease based on sequence alignment with rubella virus. it has been studied in a variety of expression paradigms, leading to directly conflicting results. the region acts as a true virally encoded protease that processes the HEV polyprotein into discrete functional units. expressing histidine and HA-tagged replicons in HUH 7 S10-3 cells showed the 186 kDa protein processed into approximately 35 and 78 kDa fragments. one study found that purified and dialyzed fragments of HEV ORF1 and ORF2 were processed into smaller fragments when incubated with purified protein from the PCP region. authors made mutations in an HEV genotype 1 reporter replicon. found viral replication to be impeded, and treating HUH7 S10-3 cells with a serine protease inhibitor or siRNA to interfere with these cellular factors also inhibited viral replication. a group investigating the innate immune evasion strategies of this region of ORF1 found truncated versions of ORF1 containing the PCP and were unable to observe any cleavage products. the function of the putative protease domain is still as enigmatic as ever, and future studies will hopefully shed more unambiguous light on the functions of this region of the HEV replicase. silico analysis predicted a papain-like beta barrel fold and identified the proteolytic dyad of this putative papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) as residues C434 and H443. a putative zinc-binding motif and three potential disulfide bridges were also predicted in the PCP region. study found purified and dialyzed fragments of HEV ORF1 and ORF2 were processed into smaller fragments when incubated with purified protein from the PCP region spanning amino acids 440\u2013610. a recent study found two conserved putative cleavage sites for cellular thrombin and one putative cleavage site for cellular factor Xa within HEV ORF1. experiments with radioactive methionine did not show processing. other studies expressing epitope-tagged ORF1 protein of genotype 1 and genotype 3 of HEV did not show processed protein via Western blot [47], nor did IP of tagged ORF1 show processing in the human hepatoma line. RRLLXTYPDG at the N- and C- termini respectively, however, the intervening sequence contains the most divergence of any region in the virus, earning it the name \u2018hypervariable region\u2019 [51] the HVR is also known as the polyproline region. HVR sequence divergence is >2-fold greater for zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 than for human genotype 1, suggesting a potential association between sequence heterogeneity and host tropism. in vitro studies reveal that insertion of sequences in the HVR can expand the host range of HEV strains in vitro. strains with ribosomal inserts constituted minor quasispecies of the original clinical isolates from chronically infected patients. the strains with insertions became the major species, indicating that these insertions conferred a replicative advantage in cell culture. the Kernow-C1-p6 strain is one of the most commonly used HEV strains in cell culture studies due to its robust replicative capacity. the HVR is the primary region accounting for size differences in HEV genomes from different genotypes. the HVR is typically 70\u201372 amino acids in length for genotype 1 HEV, 68 amino acids for genotype 2 HEV, 80\u201386 amino acids for genotype 3 HEV, 84 aa for all genotype 4 HEVs, and 84 aa for avian HEV. HVR sequence divergence is >2-fold greater for HEV zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 than for human genotype 1. in vitro studies reveal that insertion of sequences in the HVR can expand the host range of HEV strains in vitro. the specific role of the HVR in viral replication remains to be elucidated. the Kernow-C1-p6 strain is one of the most commonly used HEV strains in cell culture studies due to its robust replicative capacity. the S17 insertion has also been shown to expand the host range of several HEV strains in vitro, suggesting a potential role in host adaptation. the HEV helicase falls under superfamily 1, which possesses seven conserved motifs arranged in a co-linear fashion. motif VI is thought to bind nucleic acids due to the high number of basic residues, namely arginine. other mutations in the helicase domain of HEV genotype 3 have varying effects on viral replication in a reporter replicon system expressing Renilla luciferase. for example, the A1213V and V1213A point mutations respectively reduce replication of the genotype 1 SAR55 and genotype 3 SHEV replicon strains. RNA helicases fall under three superfamilies, with each helicase assigned a family based on sequence similarity to conserved motifs and putative helicase and NTPase activity. all three superfamilies share two motifs, known as Walker A and Walker B sites. the A site contains a run of hydrophobic residues followed by a conserved GxxxxGKS/T site. protein fragment from amino acids 960 to 1204 of the helicase domain unwinds RNA duplexes with 5\u2032 overhangs exhibiting a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 polarity. a study utilizing a radioactive phosphate assay revealed that the aforementioned HEV helicase domain ranging from amino acids 960 to 1204 from genotype 1 HEV exhibits 5\u2032 NTPase activity, suggesting that this activity is essential during RNA cap formation. a study aimed at finding novel inhibitors to this virally encoded protein domain demonstrated that the saturation mutagenesis producing synonymous mutations within the helicase domain did not affect in vitro-transcribed RNA synthesis. the nucleotide sequences therein are dispensable at the transcriptional level, suggesting non-conservation of the genome. the HEV RdRp binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of the sense strand to produce the antisense intermediate strand and to the 5\u2032 UTR of the antisense strand to produce the full-length sense RNA genome. the RdRp also binds to a subgenomic promoter (SgP) spanning a 44 nt region from the 3\u2032 end of the ORF1 to the transcriptional start site of ORF3 [14,70] the HEV RdRp has also been shown to interact with the HEV PCP. it binds the host interferon-induced protein IFIT1 to inhibit its anti-translational activity. a curious feature of the RdRp is that it contains multiple B cell epitopes. in immunocompromised patients suffering chronic infections with genotype 3 HEV, a G1634R point mutation in the RdRp (Reference strain: GenBank ID AF459438) was correlated with higher plasma HEV RNA levels and initial resistance to ribavirin treatment. additional genotype 3 mutations in the RdRp have been identified in patients showing clinical resistance to ribavirin. the strain of HEV spans nucleotides 1249\u20131671 (GenBank accession M73218). it is located downstream of the RNA helicase gene across all genotypes. there are no structures available for any supergroup III RdRps, including the HEV RdRp. in vitro studies have shown that the HEV RdRp has the highest affinity for the 3\u2032 UTR of the sense strand, than for the 5\u2032 UTR of the antisense strand, and relatively lower affinity for SgP in the antisense strand. the HEV RdRp has also been shown to interact with several host and immune factors since these exert complementary functions to RNA transcription. miR-122 may be a proviral factor for HEV as it is for hepatitis C virus (HCV), though the specific role of miR-122 in the context of the HEV lifecycle is not known. a curious feature of the RdRp is that it contains multiple B cell epitopes. in vitro studies of these mutations did not demonstrate increased replication fitness or resistance to ribavirin. however, these findings already suggest that RdRp sequencing may be a useful prognostic tool for patients and clinicians. two stem loop structures located at nucleotides 7089\u20137163 and 7173\u20137194 (Ref: AF076239) as well as the 3\u2032 poly-A tail are critical for interaction with the RdRp. mutations in the stem loop regions or deletion of the poly-A tail result in greatly reduced binding of the RdRp. the SgP is required for RdRp-mediated transcription of the capped, 2200 bp bicistronic sgRNA encoding ORF2 and ORF3. mutations in the SgP accordingly abolish ORF2 and ORF3 protein translation. a highly conserved stem loop structure is located at nucleotides 5080\u20135123. is the role of the Y domain in the HEV replication cycle? What is the structure of the ORF1 polyprotein, or structures of ORF1-encoded proteins (if processed)"}
