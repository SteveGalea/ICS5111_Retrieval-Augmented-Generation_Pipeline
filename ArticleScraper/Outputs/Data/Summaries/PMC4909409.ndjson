{"summary": "the eIF4F complex consists of 3 subunits that function to recruit ribosomes to mRNAs. the eIF4F complex is regulated by mTOR via phosphorylation of eIF4E-Binding Proteins (4E-BPs \u2013 of which there are 3 genes with 4E-BP1 being the bestcharacterized) eIF4E and eIF4B share a common binding site on eIF4G. not shown is mRNA circularization mediated through poly(A) tail:poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and eIF4G. eIF4E is under homeostatic control via regulation of 4E-BP levels. reductions in eIF4E levels leads to increased degradation of 4E-BP1 buffering against changes in eIF4F levels. several of these eIF4F-dependent mRNAs fuel tumorigenesis and thus one way to impact tumor maintenance is to block eIF4F activity. eIF4AI and eIF4AII are functionally interchangeable in vitro. eIF4AI and eIF4AII possess both RNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-stimulated RNA-binding activity. mutants of eIF4A have highlighted the critical role that this factor plays in translation. dn eIF4A mutants have revealed that translation inhibition is directly related to the degree of 5\u2032 UTR secondary structure. the activity of eIF4A can be negatively regulated by PDCD4. the association between PDCD4 and eIF4A is regulated by the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway through the downstream S6K branch. hippuristanol \u2013 a selective inhibitor of eIF4A Hippuristanol is a member of one of 4 classes of polyoxygenated steroids. these include (i) the hippurin or hippuristanol type containing a spiroketal ring, (ii) the gorgosterol type containing a cyclopropane residue, and (iv) the hippuristerone type possessing a 3-keto functionality hippuristanol-like compounds exhibit the highest level of activity against tumor cells in culture. there is also one report describing moderate activity of a hippuristerone against human cytomegalovirus (EC50 approximately 10 M) the same compound showed no activity against HT-29 human colon carcinoma or human embryonic lung cells. hippuristanol locks eIF4AI in a closed conformation preventing its transition from a closed to an open state. 77 hippuristanol may be locking eIF4A in an aberrant closed complex that can no longer participate in initiation. mutagenesis studies have revealed that hippuristanol interacts with the C-terminal domain of eIF4A in a pocket involving amino acids. hippuristanol inhibits the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of both eIF4AI and eIF4AII. ten times more hippuristanol is required to inhibit the ATPase activity of eIF4AIII compared to eIF4AI. the selectivity of hippuristanol for eIF4A has provided a powerful tool by which to probe for eIF4A-dependent processes. hippuristanol has been used to characterize viral and cellular IRESes in vitro and in vivo. puristanol is active against primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), causing cell cycle arrest and caspase activation followed by apoptosis. eIF4E levels and eIF4F activity have also been linked to acquired resistance of PI3K and MAPK pathway targeted therapies. multiple myeloma cells are sensitive to hippuristanol (IC50 approximately 50 nM for a 48 h exposure)105. hippuristanol synergizes with dexamethasone ex vivo, a frontline glucocorticoid used in the management of this disease. four synthetic routes to hippuristanol have been published. the rank order of inhibition obtained in in vitro translation assays was similar to when several of the same congeners were assessed for direct inhibition of eIF4A RNA helicase activity32. these results demonstrate that a large surface area of hippuristanol likely participate in binding to eIF4A.
