{"summary": "a number of high-impact natural hazard events have intensified interest in health systems\u2019 ability to prepare for, and cope with, \u201csurges\u201d in treatment needs. in this article, we identify key concepts and components associated with this emerging research theme. we consider the requirements for a standardized conceptual framework for future research capable of informing policy to reduce the morbidity and mortality impacts. no limitations on country of origin or of emphasis were included. a number of articles applied the concept to day-to-day fluctuations in emergency room numbers. we excluded those that limited the concept's application to operational issues surrounding emergency room overcrowding. 176 articles were screened for relevance in line with our stated exclusion and inclusion criteria. ten more articles were found in the bibliographies of papers originating in the initial search. a total of 186 academic, peer-reviewed articles were reviewed. this extension was considered valid given that the value of the health system surge capacity concept is largely its relevance (or otherwise) to real-world \u201csurge\u201d scenarios. our examination of government and NGO web resources, publications, and reports discovered a recent (and ongoing) crossover of the term \u201csurge capacity\u201d from the academic literature. the term \u201csurge\u201d refers exclusively to severe and unanticipated escalations in health system demand. the term \u201csurge\u201d is applied to any peak in patient census, including those associated with day-to-day operations. the focus is on individual facilities and emergency departments. a range of terms have been proposed for distinguishing these broad event types on the basis of injury/illness profiles, geographical coverage, oscillations and trajectories over time, and duration. a range of terms have been proposed for distinguishing these broad event types on the basis of their injury/illness profiles, geographical coverage, oscillations and trajectories over time, and duration. cholera outbreak that followed in the wake of the 2010 earthquake illustrates the potential for enormous repercussions to follow from phased impacts. cholera had been absent from Haiti for more than a century. there is a tendency to conflate the terms \"surge\" and \"surge capacity\" the term \"surge\" refers to a sudden escalation and/or intensification of demand. most definitions of \"surge capacity\" denote \"the ability...to respond to a sudden escalation and/or intensification of demand\" ACEP 2006, 1, italics added. other authors emphasize that surge capacity relates to not merely the sufficiency of currently available resources but also the ability to effectively and rapidly expand capacity. this concept was articulated clearly by Hick and colleagues. the first entails the concept's increasing occurrence in international guidelines and best practices. the first entails the concept's increasing occurrence in international guidelines and best practices. the second is in its application to the ability of humanitarian and aid agencies to scale up their own operational capacity in response to sudden-onset needs. the term \u201csurge capacity\u201d is most commonly used as a synonym for \u201ccapacity\u201d. a separate identity for the \u201ccapability\u201d concept revolves around its designation to denote the availability and adequacy of specialized resources and skills needed to meet the needs of a specific injury group, such as burn victims. the value added by defining an additional concept in this way is unclear. this consensus has emerged in recent years, largely in response to increasing dissatisfaction with prior attempts to conceptualize (and measure) surge capacity. other recommendations that represent surge capacity as synonymous with bed numbers suggest an ability to expand bed numbers by 25 to 30 percent. there is a wide degree of consensus regarding the central importance of maintaining sufficient staffing levels throughout a surge scenario's duration. the integration of personnel numbers into estimates of existing capacity and diagnostics of potential shortfalls is widely understood to imply a need for analysis that goes beyond measuring available staffing levels. an opt-out option enabling staff unwilling to work in conditions they judge too risky to personal (and family) health to instead undertake tangential, low-risk, duties was suggested. the extent to which this expectation is credible is highly contingent on the nature of the surge event and its wider context. authors have suggested using the military medical corps to supplement civilian staffing levels. this has been countered with concerns that relying on military medical resources may not be feasible. in severe disaster scenarios, such resources would be reserved for military support. a recent retrospective study of the effectiveness of Asian countries\u2019 pandemic surge capacity found a high incidence of hospitals with no available ICU beds. this implies a need for simple updatable systems to enable resource use and depletion to be tracked over time and space. in the united states, the ability of hospitals and health systems to develop and maintain emergency stockpiles is widely acknowledged8 to be severely undermined. structures/Space Hospitals are the \u201cstructures\u201d most commonly cited as components of surge capacity. more ambitious recommendations for new \u201csurge-proof\u201d hospitals include the creation of \u201cuniversal patient rooms configurable for any purpose,\u201d modular equipment, 100 percent air filtration. deLia and Wood 2008; Hick et al. 2004; Hogg et al. 2006; Romano 2005; Schultz and Koenig 2006) have also been proposed as means of supplementing hospital space. a wide range of potential \u201calternate sites\u201d have also been proposed as means of supplementing hospital space. in response to its widespread neglect, Hick, Barbera, and Kelen (2009) emphasize that without it, the other factors \u201ccannot be appropriately managed\u201d research on the efficacy of surge responses to earlier high-profile events has consistently found the main limiting factor to be management systems not matching resources to needs. the concentration on facility provides a comprehensive and coherent account of the systems that need to be in place at this level. other authors have made a strong case for a model of \u201ccentral proactive coordination\u201d on the grounds that \u201cduring an emergency, normal referral practices are unlikely to work\u201d most of the empirical studies assessing the existing surge capacity have measured the availability of \u201cstaffed beds\u201d at the facility, regional, and/or national level. some have looked at ways to use staff numbers to proxy surge capacity. a simple count of available staffed beds, however calculated, may give a false sense of alarm. capacity modeling for pandemic-induced surges in demand is at a more advanced stage than natural hazard\u2013induced disasters. complexity and sophistication of such models are increasing, with more recent work exploring the potential for integrating parameterized feed-back loops to account for resource depletion over the duration of the surge. a sudden, unexpected escalation in health care needs induced by a public health emergency may be (adopting Bonnet and colleagues\u2019 terms) geographically \u201ccontained\u201d or widespread (\u201cpopulation-based\u201d). analysis of past hazard-event's characteristics, duration, and phased impacts. health system's surge capacity The portion of health system resources available to meet surge needs (excludes \u201ccritical baseline\u201d resources committed to meeting non-surge-related needs) analysis should be sensitive to temporal fluctuations in baseline demand. the term extends beyond its traditional application to disaster contexts to encompass daily, weekly, and seasonal fluctuations in emergency departments\u2019 patient numbers. the debate turns on the term's applicability to this latter context, as well as the relationship (if any) between care need escalations embedded in regular fluctuations in patient inflow (widely termed \u201cdaily surge\u201d) and those related to extraordinary events. \u201csurge\u201d concept is applied equally to operational fluctuations and disaster contexts. it is reserved for scenarios occasioning departure from standard operational practices. its application to daily fluctuations is deemed inappropriate and confusing. recent research has sought to subtype the concept of surge capacity. this has entailed differentiating natural hazard\u2013induced disaster events from communicable disease outbreaks. a range of terms have been proposed for distinguishing these broad event types on the basis of injury/illness profiles, geographical coverage, oscillations over time, and duration. the cholera outbreak that followed in the wake of the 2010 earthquake illustrates the potential for enormous repercussions to follow from phased impacts. this event highlights the uncertainty and unpredictability that can attend the transition from proximate to latent phases of disaster-induced health care demands. hotchkin and Rubinson adopt this unwieldy verb to talk of \"surging critical care capacity\" the majority position is to define and/or use the term \"surge\" to refer to a sudden escalation and/or intensification of demand. this conceptualization was articulated clearly by Hick and colleagues. they defined surge capacity as \"the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity\" the first entails the concept's increasing occurrence in international guidelines and best practices. the term \u201csurge response capability\u201d is a recent addition to the literature. it follows the academic literature's emphasis on the \u201cfour S's\u201d of surge capacity. the term \u201csurge response capability\u201d is most commonly used as a synonym for \u201ccapacity\u201d. the value added by defining an additional concept in this way is unclear. this presents surge capability as a measure that enables the proportion of surge cases that the available resources can accommodate to be quantified. this potential remains untested, since there has been little engagement with this definition. barbisch and Koenig were among the first to problematize relying on bed numbers as proxy for surge capacity. their four-component approach (staff, stuff, structure, and systems) has since proved influential. there has been a tendency for the fourth component, systems, to be neglected in favor of concentrating on \u201cstaff, stuff, and structures\u201d the extent to which a health professional's sense of duty will overcome his or her anxiety of risk represents a major source of unpredictability for surge capacity planning. an opt-out option enabling staff unwilling to work in conditions they judge too risky to personal (and family) health to instead undertake tangential, low-risk, duties was suggested. the extent to which this expectation is credible is highly contingent on the nature of the surge event and its wider context. the mutual impact on, and of, relations between colleagues undertaking frontline and peripheral duties also will likely affect the practicality of any such arrangement. a number of authors have suggested using the military medical corps to supplement civilian staffing levels. authors recommend using existing (and creating new) registers of medical personnel willing to volunteer their assistance in the event of a disaster- or pandemic-induced surge. authors note difficulties of mobilization in scenarios in which transport infrastructure is damaged; ability for local commitments to override more distant (but more urgent) ones in the event of a large-scale scenario. a recent article by Hick, Barbera, and Kelen (2009) proposes measures that can be taken if stockpiled pharmaceuticals and supplies are insufficient. these recommendations highlight an important point regarding the standard of care that surge capacity should try to provide. despite this recent intervention, this remains an issue that the literature rarely addresses directly. the widespread creation of reserve wards and the resurrection of decommissioned spaces have been proposed as a less disruptive alternative. a number of ways that hospitals can efficiently use nonmedical spaces have also been proposed in the event of a surge. plans for constructing temporary surge facilities have also been recommended. the technology exists for surge wards with airborne isolation facilities to be constructed and outfitted for inpatient care in a matter of days. this idea could help in the management of a prolonged surge scenario but is of limited applicability to short-term events. the neglect of the \u201csystems\u201d aspect seems to lie in its essential difference from the other constitutive aspects (staff, \u201cstuff,\u201d space) of surge capacity in regard to operationalization and measurement. authors have made a strong case for a model of \u201ccentral proactive coordination\u201d on the U.S. national Incident Management System. ick, Barbera, and Kelen (2009) identify the health system rather than the facility as the locus of response coordination and management. this approach is increasingly gaining ground among authors wanting to situate surge capacity in a wider health systems approach. the extent to which a health professional's sense of duty will overcome his or her anxiety of risk represents a major source of unpredictability for surge capacity planning. opt-out option enabling staff unwilling to work in conditions they judge too risky to personal (and family) health to instead undertake tangential, low-risk, duties was suggested. authors have suggested using the military medical corps to supplement civilian staffing levels. this has been countered with concerns that relying on military medical resources may not be feasible, since in severe disaster scenarios or those implying security threats such resources would be reserved for military support. despite concerns about overreliance on bed numbers as an exclusive indicator of capacity, there remains a wide consensus that the \u201cavailability of empty beds (along with requisite medical staff)\u201d forms \u201ca fundamental component of hospitals\u2019 surge capacity...during the first hours and days of a disaster\u201d (DeLia and Wood 2008, 1688) structures/Space Hospitals are the \u201cstructures\u201d most commonly cited as components of surge capacity. a recent trend in the literature is to explore means of incorporating surge capacity infrastructure into plans for new hospitals. a wide range of potential \u201calternate sites\u201d have also been proposed as means of supplementing hospital space. the technology exists for surge wards with airborne isolation facilities to be constructed and outfitted for inpatient care in a matter of days. a model was tried in the united states in response to hurricane Katrina. the costs of storing and maintaining the units, together with the difficulties of licensing them as treatment spaces, are cited as barriers. the neglect of the \u201csystems\u201d aspect seems to lie in its essential difference from the other constitutive aspects of surge capacity. one approach might be to develop an independent identity for systems, perhaps by elaborating the distinction between capacity and capability. the difficulty of translating the complex interdependencies inherent in the concept of surge capacity has meant measures and metrics have tended to concentrate on the \u201cstuff\u201d component and to depend on static and simplified proxies for its measurement. most of the empirical studies assessing the existing surge capacity have measured the availability of \u201cstaffed beds\u201d at the facility, regional, and/or national level. there is wide consensus9 that freeing the baseline capacity would be a key first step in the event of a surge scenario. more research is needed to estimate the proportion of baseline resource utilization that is amenable to triage in various contexts and scenarios. Attempts to simulate surge capacity have generally entailed a wider number of indicators and parameters than those for survey or observational data analyses. the complexity and sophistication of such models are increasing. more recent work exploring the potential for integrating parameterized feed-back loops to account for the dynamics of resource depletion over the duration of the surge. the literature indicates beds to be a necessary but not sufficient proxy. it is impractical to incorporate every resource in estimates and models. evaluation of risks posed by supply chains in the event that imports are compromised. a major hurdle to the development of surge capacity as a coherent sphere of research has been the absence of consensus regarding definitions and applications of key terms. despite these difficulties, \u201csurge capacity\u201d is an important concept for the study of health systems\u2019 disaster and pandemic readiness and response. in the literature on surge capacity is the expectation that a severe, prolonged surge event necessarily entails a diminished standard of care. a potential way forward conceptually and analytically may lie in the development of the debates around the distinction between surge capacity and surge capability. a potential way forward conceptually and analytically may lie in the development of the debates around the distinction between surge capacity and surge capability. a coherent conceptual and analytical framework would be an important step toward creating a defined research space to enhance the development of evidence and to inform policy and practice. this move has been called for more widely in relation to health systems research."}
