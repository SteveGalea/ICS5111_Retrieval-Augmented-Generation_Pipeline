{"summary": "inflammation is an essential host defence mechanism, required for protection against pathogenic micro-organisms and viruses. in sepsis there is loss of homeostatic control over the inflammatory response mounted against an infectious agent. chronic, non-resolving inflammation also underpins a number of other pulmonary diseases. eicosapentaenoic acid involving aspirin-acetylated cyclo-oxygenase 2.6 Protectins are also omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives. lipid mediators lipoxin, resolvin and lipoxin all have a pro-resolution role in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. H5N1 infection was associated with up-regulation of inflammasome genes. extra-pulmonary dissemination was associated with down-regulation of genes involved in mediating the pro-resolution effects of lipoxin on leucocyte recruitment. loss of lipoxin\u2019s pro-resolution effects may be associated with greater influenza A virus virulence. Alternatively activated macrophages are thought to induce anti-inflammatory cytokine expression and drive lung tissue repair. treatment with lipoxin A4 and resolvin E1 partially restored the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype in the 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice. these observations support a pro-resolution role for lipoxins in viral respiratory tract infection. mice have been shown to produce high levels of lipoxin A4 during chronic infection. mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase were able to control M. tuberculosis better than wild-type mice. fewer T. gondii brain cysts were seen in lipoxin-deficient mice. a lipoxin analogue rescued the lipoxin-deficient mice from this fatal phenotype and lowered IL-12 and IFN- levels (to wild-type levels in the case of IFN-) in mice, it has been shown lipoxin A4 analogues suppress IL-12 production by dendritic cells stimulated with T. gondii extract. lipoxin-deficient mice may be a result of better control of M. tuberculosis replication. it is also important to note that the local biosynthesis and actions of lipoxin may differ between these two infection models. treatment with 15-epi-lipoxin A4 significantly prolonged survival in both wild-type and lipoxin-deficient mice. mortality rate did not differ significantly if lipoxin was administered on day of infection or 3 days later. lipoxin up-regulated the expression of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) this is an innate immune defence molecule that is active against Gram negative bacteria, through bactericidal effects on bacterial cell membranes, neutralization of lipopolysaccharide and as an opsonin. the authors sought to examine the effect of lipoxin on epithelial killing of Salmonella typhimurium. avian H5N1 virus is more virulent in humans than 1918 H1N1 virus. cases-mortality rate of 60% compared with 25% in mice. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection of mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase failed to elicit alternative macrophage differentiation. Alternatively activated macrophages are thought to induce anti-inflammatory cytokine expression and drive lung tissue repair. mice have been shown to produce high levels of lipoxin A4 during chronic infection. mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase were able to control M. tuberculosis better than wild-type mice. fewer T. gondii brain cysts were seen in the lipoxin-deficient mice. a lipoxin analogue rescued the lipoxin-deficient mice from this fatal phenotype and lowered IL-12 and IFN- levels (to wild-type levels in case of IFN-) lipoxins are beneficial to the host, and so enhance survival. toxoplasma gondii replicates more quickly than M. tuberculosis. reduced tissue damage seen in lipoxin-deficient mice may be a result of better control of M. tuberculosis replication. wild-type and 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei-ANKA in a model of cerebral malaria. lipoxin-deficient mice had increased cerebral parasite burden after 5 days despite reduced cerebral inflammation and less CD8+ IFN-+ T cells in brain tissue. wild-type rabbits subject to periodontitis induction were then administered topical lipoxin analogue. this protected the animals from gross soft tissue destruction, leucocyte accumulation and bone loss. induction of BPI was largely responsible for enhanced killing of S. typhimurium. in a mouse model of dextran sodium-sulphate-induced colitis, oral administration of lipoxin analogue reduced weight loss, passage of blood per rectum and mortality, affirming its role in gastrointestinal mucosal inflammatory conditions. administration of resolvin (D1 or D5) was associated with a significantly lower titre of viable bacteria in the blood and peritoneal exudate, as well as a lesser degree of hypothermia. resolvin D1 increased survival in this model. burns-related sepsis Infection secondary to burns is an important clinical problem. neutrophils isolated from burned rats were impaired in their ability to migrate towards a chemoattractant. this defect in neutrophil chemotaxis could result in inability of neutrophils in burns patients to successfully reach and kill infectious agents. infiltration, enhanced bacterial clearance and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in lung tissue homogenates. mice administered resolvin E1 enjoyed increased survival (100% at 3 days, in comparison to 50% when only 09% saline was administered) the role of resolvin in this process has been investigated in mouse models of acute lung injury. resolvin administration reduced 6 hr mortality from 70% to 30%. in vitro, resolvin E1 mitigates cellular survival signals generated in response to stimuli relevant to pathogenesis of acute lung injury in E. coli pneumonia and sepsis. the influx of CD4+ T cells and neutrophils was reduced, as were corneal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be involved in the pathogenesis of stromal keratitis. intravenous administration of resolvin D2 reduced the viable bacterial load in blood and peritoneal exudates (in the absence of direct antibacterial effects) administration of resolvin (D1 or D5) was associated with a significantly lower titre of viable bacteria in the blood and peritoneal exudate, as well as a lesser degree of hypothermia. resolvin D1 enhanced the antimicrobial effect of ciprofloxacin in resolving E. coli. burns-related sepsis Infection secondary to burns is an important clinical problem. neutrophils isolated from burned rats were impaired in their ability to migrate towards a chemoattractant. this defect in neutrophil chemotaxis could result in inability of neutrophils in burns patients to successfully reach and kill infectious agents. mice administered resolvin E1 enjoyed increased survival (100% at 3 days, in comparison to 50% when only 09% saline was administered) neutrophil apoptosis is known to be a critical event in the resolution of pulmonary inflammation, and suppression of this process is thought to contribute to the pathology seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. resolvin administration reduced 6 hr mortality from 70% to 30% in this model. resolvin E1 mitigates cellular survival signals generated in response to stimuli relevant to pathogenesis of acute lung injury in E. coli pneumonia and sepsis. cytokines known to be involved in pathogenesis of stromal keratitis increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. protectins Through a screen of the effect of a range of lipid mediators on the replication of H1N1 influenza A virus in humans. bacterial load 19 Toxoplasma gondii Mouse Lipoxin reduces mortality but increases parasite load 21\u201322 Trypanosoma cruzi Mouse 15-epi-lipoxin A4 reduces parasitaemia and increases survival 23 Plasmodium berghei-ANKA Mouse 15-epi-lipoxin A4 increases survival 24 Periodontitis (Porphyromonas gingivalis) Rabbit Lipoxin reduces leucocyte infiltration and lipoxin abrogated the tissue and bone damage seen in a rabbit model of P. gingivalis periodontitis. this benefit may be out-weighed in some situations by permitting unchecked pathogen replication. resolvin administration also reduced the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice. mice unable to synthesize lipoxin fail to elicit alternative macrophage differentiation, required for the resolution of RSV disease. pro-resolution, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial-enhancing effects of resolvins, protectin and possibly lipoxins make these appealing candidates for further study in humans."}
