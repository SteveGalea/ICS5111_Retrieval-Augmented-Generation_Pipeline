{"summary": "single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction is typically applied to purified proteins and macromolecular complexes. cryo-EM studies have deepened our understanding of how a virus can maintain a robust assembly that protects the genome in the vector and outside the human host. cryo-EM analysis is proving exceptionally useful for discerning the full epitopes that are recognized by antibodies. symmetrical subassemblies, such as bacteriophage portal, tail, and baseplate complexes, have also been characterized in multiple conformational states by single-particle cryo-EM. symmetry is utilized during image processing to improve signal-to-noise. cryo-EM and crystal structures of a soluble, mutation-stabilized form of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein trimer and a cryo-EM reconstruction of native Env [29] have resolved controversies that accompanied initial EM models of this biomedically important cell entry machine. cryo-EM and crystal structures of a retroviral integration complex have recently resolved controversies that accompany initial EM models of this biomedically important cell entry machine. single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction relies on imaging thousands and even thousands of individual particles in a sample. the end result may be reconstructed from a small subset of the population that was present in the sample. new analytical tools are increasingly gaining in ability to parse heterogeneity that exists within even \u201cpure\u201d specimens. tomography provides a means of gathering three-dimensional structural information by tilting a specimen to image a field of view over a range of angles. this imaging scheme is subject to some basic limitations that result in reduced resolution relative to single-particle cryo-EM. resulting projection images from the tilt-series are computationally reconstructed to generate the tomographic density. sub-tomogram averaging has provided low-resolution structures of glycoproteins in situ on the surface of virions. in the case of Ebola GP, tomography localized the heavily glycosylated mucin domain in the context of a complete GP spike, which had been refractory to crystallization. some mature flavivirus particles imaged by cryo-ET suggest maturation initiates at the vertices and progresses across the capsid surface. cell-free virus represents only one stage of the viral infectious cycles. dynamic events ranging from receptor engagement to replication and assembly take place in the context of the host cell. cryo-ET is a transmission EM approach that relies upon penetration of the electron beam through the specimen. thick specimens often do not yield interpretable images. cellular cryo-ET at present is mostly confined to examining processes such as cell entry and enveloped virus budding."}
