{"summary": "reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can be produced continuously as a natural byproduct of the cellular metabolism when oxygen and nitrogen interact with certain molecules. these molecules play important roles in cellular signaling and homeostasis, which protect the human body against bacteria and viruses. antioxidants are used to neutralize and eliminate harmful activities of ROS and RNS through different ways to protect the human body. anti-inflammatory (Boots et al., 2008b; Rogerio et al., 2007), anti-viral (Lee et al., 2005; 2010), anti-viral (Chen et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2008) and anti-cancer (Hirpara et al., 2009; Puoci et al., 2012) properties. quercetin 3-O--(2\u2032\u2032-galloyl)-rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O--(2\u2032\u2032-galloyl)-glucopyranoside (QGG) were isolated from the aerial parts of Polygonum salicifolium and Persicaria lapathifolia (Polygonaceae) as previously. antibodies specific for phospho-IB, phospho-NF-B p65, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-ERK, ERK, iNOS and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA) all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), respectively. the mixtures were seeded in a white 96-well plate at a density of 3 105 cells per well. after incubation for 30 min, the cells were pretreated with various concentrations of each compound for 5 min in the presence of lucigenin (25 M) the cells were then stimulated with either unopsonized zymosan (0.3 mg/ml) or PMA (0.1 g/ml) peroxynitrite production cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 2.5 105 cells per well. after overnight, cells were treated with various concentrations of each compound in the presence or absence of zymosan for 24 h. triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. whole-cell extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyviny the protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. dried gels were exposed to X-ray films at 80\u00b0C. the cells harboring pNF-B-SEAP-NPT reporter construct were pretreated for 1 h.
