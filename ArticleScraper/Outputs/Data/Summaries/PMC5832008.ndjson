{"summary": "insects exhibit humoral and cellular immune responses against pathogens. lack of adaptive immune system has forced insects to choose immediate non-specific responses against pathogens. non-coding RNA represents a portion of RNA that does not code a protein. in insects, lncRNAs have been reported in D. melanogaster [11], Anopheles gambiae [12], Apismellifera [13,14], and Bombyx mori [15]. the present review is focused on the lncRNAs that are involved in immunity. lncRNAs can have either DNA binding sites, protein binding sites, or both. the databases dedicated to lncRNAs include LNCipedia and lncRNome [17,18], which describe their functions based on literature. noncode contains ncRNA sequences on a dozen organisms, including D. melanogaster. only six lncRNAs have been experimentally validated. lncRNAs in mammalian immunity have an important regulatory role. lncRNAs are reported in the regulation of immune responses. lncRNAs were reported to express following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in mouse macrophages. lncRNA-COX2 is linked directly to the control of inflammatory response. lncRNA-COX2 interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. lncRNAs are reported in insects like aedesgambiae, anopheles gambiae, Danausplexippus, or Heliconiusmelpomene. the lncRNAs are usually classified as those involved in development, behavior, or neural expression. anopheles gambiae RNAseq Apis mellifera AncR-1 Neural expression [27] Kakusei RNA metabolism [14] Ks-1 Neural expression [28] Lnccov1/2 Autophagic cell death of ovarioles [29] Nb-1 Putative role in polyethism [49] Bombyx mori Fben-1 Biosynthesis, translocation, and secretion of silk proteins [46,47] Drosophila four putative lncRNAs were selected for further investigation. time course analysis revealed differential expression of lncRNAs in the midgut and fat body tissues. lncRNA4 showed high expression at 48 and 96 h post infection. lncRNAs can act as a decoy and titrate away dimerization of Toll on the plasma membrane, resulting in dysregulation of the Toll signaling pathway. lncRNAs can act as a decoy and titrate away dimerization of Toll on the plasma membrane, resulting in dysregulation of the toll signaling pathway. model system understands antiviral mechanism of higher eukaryotes."}
