{"summary": "elements have been found to regulate viral replicase binding and viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis. local RNA elements in viral genomes often involved in long-range RNA-RNA interactions. genus flavivirus includes important causative agents for human diseases. viviruses include mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs), tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs), insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) and flaviviruses with no known vectors (NKVs) the flaviviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, and their genome is approximately 11 kb. cis-acting elements are crucial for vRNA replication. cyclization of complementary sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini. cis-acting elements are crucial for vRNA replication. the 5\u2032 UAR element in MBFV usually participates in the formation of a local hairpin, stem-loop B (SLB), in the linear conformation of the vRNA. the uracil-rich sequence has been shown to mediate vRNA replication of DENV. a combination of our results suggested that the UFS and its cousin elements regulate the binding of viral RdRp to vRNA dynamically. the 5\u2032 end sequences and the query sequences composed of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of DENV4 vRNA were analyzed. the RNA structure prediction showed that the region of most MBFVs (except the YFV clade) forms a duplex with complementary sequences in or near the viral translational starting region.

Circular conformation of the DENV4 genomic RNA. the sequence of the unwound UFS duplex is shown in yellow, green and red, respectively. a short hairpin with a large loop occupied the analogous location of the UFS in these flaviviruses. results showed the conservation of UFS elements among the flavivirus genus. RNA molecules corresponding to the 5\u2032 ends of DENV1-4, JEV and ZIKV were analyzed by selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation. plex is a highly dynamic structure, at least in some flaviviruses. the presence of the deNV UFS duplex conformation was confirmed by SHAPE analysis of deNV3 5\u2032 end RNA molecules containing mutations in the UFS. reactivity of the region significantly increased in UFS-disrupted mutants. two artificial nonsense mutations are located in loop region of cHP and DCS-PK Loop 3 respectively. results presented were from two biological replicates. functional mutagenesis of the UFS was performed using a deNV4 replicon with internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-controlled viral translation. a nonsense mutation was introduced into the variable loop 3 of DCS-PK in the background of p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep to generate the p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep. circularized structures were considerably smaller than changes in the local UFS structure. mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. 'A' mutants contain mutations in the downstream strand of the UFS. the results of one of two independent biological replicates were shown. one hundred nanograms per well of replicon RNA species were transfected into BHK-21 cells in triplicate. the error bar represents the standard deviation in all figures. SHAPE analysis was performed for DENV4 5\u2032-300 nt RNA containing the UFS mutations M1A, M1C, M3A or M3C. reactivity of the UFS region increased significantly in the M1A and M3A mutants, suggesting that the UFS duplex was indeed disrupted by the corresponding mutations. nucleotides with SHAPE reactivity greater than 0.85 are labeled in red. moderately reactive sites (0.4\u20130.85) are labeled in green. two biological replicates were performed for each RNA. the virus titers in the culture supernatants of M1A-transfected BHK-21 cells were significantly lower than those of M1C- or WT-transfected cells. the mutants were normalized according to input vRNA copies determined at 4 hr post-electroporation. reliable due to an error in the RNA isolation process. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17636.014 Figure 5\u2014source data 1. deNV4 NS5-GVD-vRNAs containing different UFS mutations were transfected into BHK-21 cells by electroporation. only negligible differences in RNA stability were found between WT RNA and the mutants of the M1 or M3 groups. the stability of the M5C mutant was moderately reduced compared with that of the M5A mutant. the binding of NS5Pol to 5\u2032-300 nt RNA containing the M1A or M1B mutation in UFS was much weaker than the binding to 5\u2032-300 nt WT RNA. the 5\u2032-300 nt M3A and M3B RNA also interacted with NS5Pol weakly, whereas the combination of the two mutations apparently restored the interaction between NS5Pol and 5\u2032-300 nt M3C RNA. reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 20 min. NS5Pol concentrations in the reactions were approximately 3.6, 7.2, 10.7 and 14.3 M. dsRNA prepared by the annealing of the positive and negative strand of DENV4 5\u2032-160 nt RNA. Lane 2\u20134: products of RdRp assays using different 5\u2032-160 nt RNAs as templates. fewer products were generated in reactions containing disrupted UFS elements. UA/AU base pairs contribute less to the stability of RNA structures than CG/GC base pairs. internal loops and/or wobble base pairs are prevalent inside the UFS or at the junction connecting the UFS and SLB, which further decreases their structural stability. all mutants containing disrupted UFS elements showed only extremely low levels of replication. Fifty nanograms per well of replicon RNA were transfected into 96-well plates. Experiments were performed in triplicate. a panel of replicon mutants targeted the 3-nt internal loop region between the DENV4 UFS and SLB. a total deletion of the internal loop caused the SLB to stack onto the UFS significantly reduced the vRNA replication efficiency. the stability of the UFS duplex is a critical determinant for its function in vRNA replication. a deNV4 5\u2032-3\u2032 RNA binding assay was employed. the M1A, M1B and M1C mutations had little effect on the formation of 5\u2032-3\u2032 complex. however, when the mutants were assayed, the complex formed by the 3\u2032 UTR and 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA was greatly reduced compared to the amounts of complexes formed by the 3\u2032 UTR. molar ratios between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RNA are indicated above the gel lanes. 3\u2032 UTR RNA (20 ng/l) was incubated with different amount (16, 40, 80 and 160 ng/l) of the corresponding 5\u2032-300 nt RNA mutants. % Bound is the percentage of bound 3\u2032 UTR RNA, and [X] is the concentration of 5\u2032-300 nt RNA. the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS element in 5\u2032-300 nt WT RNA showed a significant increase compared with the reactivity when the 3\u2032 UTR was absent. the stability of its secondary structure must be maintained below a threshold to enable the necessary conformational changes required for genome cyclization. the unwinding of the UFS during genome cyclization may be important for its function in viral RNA synthesis. artificial mini-genomes have been widely used in studies of flavivirus vRNA synthesis, RdRp activity and RNA structures. the deNV4 WT mini-genome and those containing the desired mutations were constructed. first, using native PAGE, we found that the mini-genome, as well as the M1A, M1B, M1C, M3A, M3A, M3B, M3C and M2A mini-genomes, existed the regions involved in terminal interactions are colored in red, and the UFS element is labeled in blue. the conformational equilibrium of mini-genome RNA containing different mutations was analyzed using native PAGE. the bands were identified using the CS-M mutant as a control. cHP structure (cHP-M), were assayed in parallel as controls. they showed non-detected or reduced RdRp activity for de novo initiation. differences in RdRp activity between mini-genomes were likely caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the flavivirus genome have great opportunities to contact each other. because of the high affinity between them, most vRNA molecules would stay circularized in the equilibrium state. however, if the linear conformation of vRNA is present in low abundance, the question remains of how the latter can function. vRNA released in the cytoplasm is translated to generate a sufficient level of viral proteins, which leads to the eventual binding of NS5 to the SLA and the initiation of () strand synthesis. the dsRNA RF serves as the template for the synthesis of progeny vRNA in the presence of viral NS5/NS3. nascent (+) strand RNA synthesis is initiated by NS5/viral replicase. a free NS5/viral replicase is recruited to bind the 5\u2032 end of the displaced (+) strand RNA. the next round of strand synthesis is ready to start. the demonstrated structures are based on DENV4 for the MBFVs; tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) for the YFV clade of the MBFVs; wesselsbron virus (WESSV) for the YFV clade of the MBFVs and RBV for the NKVs. the kissing loop interaction identified recently in the tick-borne group is labeled by green letters (KL) demonstrated sequence was based on RBV. the gray regions are not included in the demonstration of Figure 12. mfold software and VARNA application were used to generate the structural models. the 5\u2032 UAR-UFS elements are highlighted in yellow, green and red. the nucleotides that participate in the DAR interactions are labeled in green. the sequence of the unwound UFS duplex is shown in blue. different evolutionary groups as well as various clades among the MBFV group are annotated. the local folding pattern of the 5\u2032 end and the mode of genome cyclization in the YFV clade are different than those in other MBFVs. corresponding hairpin including the U-rich region in the YFV clade was recognized as UFS. RNA molecules corresponding to the 5\u2032 ends of DENV1-4, JEV and ZIKV were analyzed by selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation (SHAPE) the SHAPE reactivity data were annotated on RNA structure models generated by mfold prediction and sequence comparison. it was shown that the UFS element of JEV forms a conical duplex structure. the SHAPE reactivity results are labeled in the structure models of different flaviviruses. highly reactive nucleotides (SHAPE reactivity > 0.85) are labeled in red, while nucleotides with moderate SHAPE reactivity (0.4\u20130.85) are labeled in green. SHAPE analysis of deNV3 5\u2032-300 nt RNA molecules containing UFS mutations is shown in parallel. a nonsense mutation was introduced into the variable loop 3 of DCS-PK in the background of p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep. p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep replicon was generated. a panel of mutants was generated, and their replication efficiency was assessed. the impact of the M1 and M3 mutations on the circularized vRNA structure was considerably smaller than the changes in the local UFS structure. artificial stop codons (red inverted triangles) were introduced into loop 3 of the DCS-PK element to abolish translation directed by the 5\u2032 cap structure. in the improved version, p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep, one additional stop codon was introduced into loop 3 of the DCS-PK element to abolish translation directed by the 5\u2032 cap structure. the mean values of relative replication efficiency are listed below the names of the replicon constructs. the mutants were designed without affecting either genome cyclization or the terminal topology of circularized genome. RNA structure predictions using the RNAstructure (Reuter and Mathews, 2010) software with SHAPE constraints confirmed that the UFS structure was disrupted/destabilized or reconstituted as aimed. these mutations did not affect the overall secondary structure of the 5\u2032 end RNA, and this function is directly correlated to its duplex conformation. vRNA copies in BHK-21 cells were significantly lower than those transfected with WT vRNA at 48\u201372 hr post-electroporation. restoration of the UFS element by complementary mutations partially or fully (Figure 5C, M3C) the virus titers in the supernatants of the mutant-transfected cells were determined in parallel. the virus titers were normalized according to input vRNA copies determined at 4 hr post-electroporation.

NS5Pol encodes the RdRp activity required for vRNA synthesis and has specific interactions with the 5\u2032 end of vRNA. the binding of NS5Pol to 5\u2032-300 nt RNA containing the M1A or M1B mutation in UFS was much weaker than the binding to 5\u2032-300 nt W EMSA assay demonstrated that the UFS duplex is also important for the efficient binding of JEV NS5Pol to its 5\u2032 end RNA. the function of UFS in viral RdRp recruitment is conserved among flaviviruses. EMSA was performed for the 5\u2032-160 nt RNA molecules containing M1 series mutations. the NS5Pol concentrations in the reactions were approximately 3.6, 7.2, 10.7 and 14.3 M (left to right) -160 nt RNA as a template were performed to investigate if the role of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment is required for de novo RNA synthesis. a electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment using 5\u2032-160 nt RNA as a probe confirmed the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment. however, the overall affinity of 5\u2032-160 nt RNA for NS5Pol was lower than that of 5\u2032- single UA-to-GC substitution at different positions replicated poorly compared with the WT replicon (Figure 7, M2C and M4C) however, the M5 mutant series, in which only one UA-to-GC substitution was involved, exhibited replication characteristics similar to the M1 and M3 series. NS5Pol binding assay of the DENV4 5\u2032-300 nt M2A and M2C mutants. binding of NS5Pol to 5\u2032-300 nt WT, M2A and M2C RNA was analyzed by EMSA assay. the internal loop are optimal for efficient DENV4 vRNA replication. the defects in the vRNA replication of the over-stabilized UFS mutants were not caused by alternations in their affinity for NS5Pol. a previous report suggested that the UFS duplex is melted after genome cyclization, whereas the 5\u2032 UAR/SLB element is important for flavivirus genome cyclization. on of dissociation constant revealed that the Kd of 5\u2032-300 nt M2C binding with 3\u2032 UTR is approximately ten fold higher than the Kds of the other 5\u2032 RNAs. the 5\u2032-300 nt L3D mutant, in which the internal loop was deleted, also interacted poorly with the 3\u2032 UTR. the formation of RNA complexes was then analyzed by native PAGE gels. the molar ratios between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RNA are indicated above the gel lanes. the 3\u2032 UTR was in 5-fold excess of 5\u2032-300 nt RNA. when the 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA was incubated with an equal concentration of 3\u2032 UTR RNA, there were only minor changes in the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS and SLB loop regions. the stability of the secondary structure must be maintained below a threshold to enable the necessary conformational changes required for genome cyclization. the changes in the SHAPE reactivity of the 5\u2032 60\u2013150 region were obtained by subtracting the SHAPE reactivity when 3\u2032 UTR RNA was absent from the corresponding values when 3\u2032 UTR RNA was present in a 1:1 ratio. the results were from two biological replicates, and the error bars represent the standard deviation. the CS-M mutant was confined to a linear conformation, as expected. the CS-M mutant mainly stayed in a linear conformation. the CS-M mutant also stayed in a linear conformation, as expected. no NS5Pol was present in the left first lane of each group. the reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 40 min. the signal of the SLA lane did not correspond to the dsRNA product generated by de novo initiation. the base composition of U-rich sequence in the UFS was actually able to affect vRNA replication of DENV2. genome cyclization disables the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, suggesting that the UFS has to function dynamically during vRNA replication. however, circular states should be dominant among its conformations. vRNA is the only conformation under which the UFS can exist. if the linear conformation of vRNA is present in low abundance, the question remains of how the latter can function. we speculated that the UFS duplex is folded during the ongoing synthesis of nascent positive-strand RNA because the 5\u2032 end of the parental (+) strand is released from the dsRNA replication form. NS5-bound vRNA undergoes genome cyclization, and the UFS element is set to 'OFF' by the hybridization between genome termini. this decreases binding strength of NS5 to the 5\u2032 terminus and promotes translocation to the 3\u2032 terminus to initiate next-round synthesis of negative-strand vRNA. dsRNA RF is a highly active template for (+) vRNA replication. bind the 5\u2032 end of the displaced (+) ssRNA genome. the next round of () strand synthesis is ready to start. this RNA-switching mechanism is likely to be universal among flaviviruses with vertebrate hosts. regions are not included in the demonstration of Figure 12. the mfold software and VARNA application were utilized to generate the structural models. the demonstrated sequence was based on TBEV. the conformational change of the UFS caused by genome cyclization is coupled with its function in modulating dynamic RdRp recruitment. it is plausible to consider that the UFS is a general regulatory strategy of viral replication among the flavivirus genus. a previous report suggested that the UFS may not be functional in DENV2. the evolutionary history of flaviviruses suggests that the UFS may play a critical role during the evolution of the genus flavivirus. it is possible that the parental (+) RNA is anchored to the vesicle membranes and prevented from being transported out of the vesicle. p4 infectious clone was generated by introducing a nonsense mutation into the 26th codon of the capsid ORF (CAA to TAA) the p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep replicon was generated by introducing a nonsense mutation into the 26th codon of the capsid ORF (CAA to TAA) pBseRI-Dualstop-04 was cloned into pGEM-T easy (promega, Wisconsin) to generate the cloning cassette vector, pBseRI-Dualstop-04. mutants containing desired mutations were then subcloned into p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep. the mutants were then subcloned into p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES the 5\u2032 end sequence of DENV1 strain westPac was synthesized and cloned into pUC57 by Thermo Fisher Scientific. the SP6 promoter sequence was placed upstream of the DENV1 5\u2032 end sequence. pAJE70 contains the 5\u2032 UTR-C-coding region of strain SA-14-14-2. a replicon assay was performed for the evaluation of the replication characteristics of the p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep and p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep mutants. ten thousand BHK-21 cells were seeded into each well of Nunc MicroWell 96-Well Optical-Bottom Plates. the plates were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were resuspended in 14 ml of Opti-MEM I medium. they were dispensed into 24-well plates with or without sterile cover slips. at 4 hr post-electroporation, a media change was performed for plates. cell nuclei staining, 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5 ng/l) was added onto the cover slips and incubated for 5 min.
