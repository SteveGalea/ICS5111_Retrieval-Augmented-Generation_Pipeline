{"summary": "plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the most important source of systemic interferon type I in the early phase of many virus infections. this is based on the ability to produce around 1000 times more IFN type I than any other cell type [1], [2]. pDC possess the necessary cell biological features such as toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR9 and constitutive high levels of IFN regulator factor (IRF)-7 to sense viruses with high efficiency. classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the causative agent of a viral hemorrhagic fever in pigs with disease characteristics resembling dengue hemorrhagic fever if pigs are infected with highly virulent strains. however, with low virulent strains chronic disease and persistent infections are observed. es with or without RNase activity do not induce IFN type I in cell culture. it represents the first example of a viral protein that prevents the stimulation of pDC by infected cells. infected cells represent a powerful activator of IFN- responses by pDC. CSFV-infected cells are powerful inducers of INF- response by pDC. pDC were either stimulated with CSFV-infected SK-6 cells, VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells or directly by CSFV or VRPErns infection. the purity of pDC 2\u20135%. pDC were the only source of IFN- following stimulation with infected cells. monocytes did not produce IFN- in response to any of the stimuli tested. infected SK-6 cells would transfer viral RNA to pDC. NS3 is generated by post-translational processing of the precursor polyprotein. pDC were stimulated either directly with VRPErns or with VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells. pDC were then resorted from these cultures by CD172a MACS sorting. pDC was 6 times more efficient in delivering RNA but induced much lower IFN- levels. a RNA was extracted from re-sorted enriched pDC (>99% CD172a+) treated with VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells. SK-6 cells or enriched pDC were co-cultured with enriched pDC. we measured the infectivity in VRPErns-infected SK-6 at the time of co-culture with pDC and found titers below 102 TCID50/ml. this corresponded to MOI of less than 104 TCID50/enriched pDC. the lack of involvement of free virions in pDC stimulation by infected cells was further confirmed by addition of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. the same antibodies did not reduce activation of pDC by CSFV- (C) or VRPErns-infected (D) cells. the results are representative of four (A, B) or three (C\u2013F) independent experiments. IFN- were low, compared to VRP-infected SK-6 cells. this was explained by the relatively low transfection efficiency of 15\u201320%. we also generated VRP with a deletion of E2 instead of Erns. SK-6 cells infected with VRPErns were more stimulatory than SK-6 cells infected with VRPE2. the results are representative of three independent experiments. the viral ribonuclease Erns effectively inhibits pDC stimulation by infected cells. supernatants harvested from SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cell cultures were added to co-cultures of enriched pDCs with MOCK- or VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells at 50% (V/V) D. SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cells were infected with wild type VRPErns or VRPErns. cells SK-6, SK6(Erns), SK-6LV(Erns) and SK-6LV(Erns346) (C) were washed 5 times with phosphate buffered saline and cultured for another 16 h in serum-free MEM. the culture supernatants were collected and the cell extracts obtained by hypotonic lysis with H2O. ral gene delivery to express wild type Erns or Erns346 with 75% transduction efficiency (E) the SK-6(Erns), SK-6LV(Erns) and SK-6LV(Erns346) were infected with VRPErns and then tested for their ability to induced IFN- in enriched pDC. the stimulation used FMDV- or TGEV-infected SK-6 and SK-6(Erns) cells for comparison. responses with infected SK-6(Erns) cells were 3 to 6-fold lower. this was not caused by an inhibitory effect of Erns on virus replication. lentivirus-transduced SK-6 cell lines expressing the parent Erns (SK-6LV(Erns)) or an RNase-inactive mutant Erns (SK-6LV(Erns346) abolished the RNase activity of Erns. however, only SK-6 expressing RNase active Erns prevented IFN- induction by VRP infection of the cell lines. VRPErns were relatively inefficient at infecting M (26% NS3+ versus 97% NS3+ with CSFV) the highest levels of IFN- were induced by M infected with the CSFV-Erns346 mutant (83% NS3+ M) neither the VRPErns, nor the CSFV-Erns346 mutant were able to induce IFN- in M. the results are representative of two independent experiments. we postulated that viral RNA is transported from the infected cells to the TLR7 compartment of pDC in a manner avoiding contact of the RNA with the extracellular space. to this end, we co-cultured pDC with VRP-infected SK-6 cells in transwell culture dishes using 0.4 or 1 m pore sizes. the mean IFN- values of three replicates measured by ELISA are shown with the standard deviation. the results indicate that infected SK-6 cells transfer RNA to pDC using a pathway which requires cell-to-cell contact dependent communication between infected cells and pDC. we tested the impact of cytoskeleton inhibitors as well as the cholesterol-depleting chemical MCD. uninfected SK-6 cells were co-cultured with pDC and IFN- measured after 20 h of incubation. infected cells represent a powerful activator of IFN- responses by pDC. VRPErns-infected SK6 cells were in average around 8 times more stimulatory than CSFV-infected SK6 cells. pDC were either stimulated with CSFV-infected SK-6 cells, VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells or directly by CSFV or VRPErns infection. pDC were the only cell type able to respond to CSFV by IFN- production. monocytes did not produce IFN- in response to any of the stimuli tested. infected SK-6 cells would transfer viral RNA to pDC. NS3 is generated by post-translational processing of the CSFV precursor. pDC were stimulated either directly with VRPErns or with VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells. pDC were stimulated either directly with VRPErns or with VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells. pDC were then resorted from these cultures by CD172a MACS sorting. the percentage of NS3 cells is shown in red for the infected cultures. on the left side the mean IFN- values and viral titers measured in the cultures are shown. 172a-re-sorted enriched pDC to remove contaminating SK-6 cells. infected cell stimulation by pDC is not mediated by cell-free virions. we measured the infectivity in VRPErns-infected SK-6 at the time of co-culture with pDC and found titers below 102 TCID50/ml. this corresponds to MOI of less than 104 TCID50/ml. results for different dilutions of anti-E2 glycoprotein mAb and anti-CSFV serum are shown. the same antibodies did not reduce activation of pDC by CSFV- (C) or VRPErns-infected (D) cells. the results shown in Figure 3E demonstrate that CSFV RNA-transfected SK-6 cells can activate pDC, although the levels of IFN- were low, compared to VRP-infected SK-6 cells. this was explained by the relatively low transfection efficiency of 15\u201320% in terms of NS3+ expression. SK-6 cells infected with VRPErns were more stimulatory than SK-6 cells infected with VRPE2. IFN- levels of cultures treated with IRS661 were significantly lower (p0.05) than those receiving control (CTRL) ODN at all concentrations. the results are representative of three independent experiments. the viral ribonuclease Erns effectively inhibits pDC stimulation by infected cells. supernatants harvested from SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cell cultures were added to co-cultures of enriched pDCs with MOCK- or VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells at 50% (V/V) D. SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cells were infected with wild type VRPErns or VRPErns. SK-6, SK6(Erns), SK-6LV(Erns) and SK-6LV(Erns346) cells were washed 5 times with phosphate buffered saline and cultured for another 16 h in serum-free MEM. pDC were activated by virus (hatched bars) or co-culture with infected SK-6 cells. SK-6 cells were transduced by lentiviral gene delivery to express wild type Erns or Erns346 with 75% transduction efficiency (E) the SK-6(Erns), SK-6LV(Erns) and SK-6LV(Erns346) were infected with VRPErns and then tested for their ability to induced IFN- in enriched pDC. we compared the effect of SK-6 and SK-6(Erns) cells infected with two other RNA viruses, the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) on pDC. the responses with infected SK-6(Erns) cells were 3 to 6-fold lower compared to SK-6 cells. the levels of IFN- remained clearly under those induced by infected cells. lentivirus-transduced SK-6 cell lines expressing the parent Erns or an RNase-inactive mutant Erns abolished the RNase activity of Erns. SK-6 cells expressing both wild-type and mutant Erns had comparable levels of Erns. VRPErns-infected and CSFV-infected M were able to activate pDC. no responses were detectable with CSFV alone. the highest levels of IFN- were induced by M infected with the CSFV-Erns346 mutant (83% NS3+ M) the responses are compared to direct stimulation by CSFV or VRPErns. the results are representative of two independent experiments. we postulated that viral RNA is transported to the TLR7 compartment of pDC in a manner avoiding contact of the RNA with the extracellular space. infected SK-6 cells were co-cultured with pDC for 24 h either in contact or separation using transwell inserts of 0.4 or 1 m. the mean IFN- values of three replicates measured by ELISA are shown with the standard deviation, calculated from a set of data. SK-6 cells were infected with VRPErns for 24 h, washed and then treated with a DMSO control, nocodazole (5 M), MCD (20 mM) or latrunculin (1 M) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then removed and washed three times to avoid effects on pDC. uninfected SK-6 cells were treated as in A and co-cultured with pDC. pDC stimulation by infected cells can be much more efficient than stimulation by virions. this is also emphasized by the identification of a viral protein that appears to have evolved to efficiently. this pathway of pDC activation is dependent on cell contact, intact actin filaments, microtubules and cell membrane cholesterol. the pestiviral Erns potently prevents pDC activation by infected cells. cytoplasmic viral RNA and Erns could be autophagocytosed after transfer to pDC. only at this acidic location the RNAse function would be highly active. one of the first questions to be addressed in future studies is whether Erns is transported to pDC to degrade RNA in the TLR7 compartment of pDC. pDC are the most potent producers of IFN type I. these viruses cause persistent infections, in both cattle and pigs. these persistently infected calves play a major role in the epidemiology. Npro induces the degradation of IRF3 and thereby efficiently prevents IFN type I induction in all host cells including conventional DC. the virus is unable to stop the much more potent activation of pDC by infected cells. SK-6 cells stably expressing Erns of CSFV strains Alfort/187, termed SK-6(Erns) were generated as described previously [49]. pDC were enriched as described previously [31] by cell sorting of CD172a+ PBMCs using the magnetic cell sorting system. the vA187-Erns346 virus (referred to as CSFV-Erns346 mutant) with a histidine deletion in Erns at position 346 of the viral polyprotein resulting in loss of RNase activity [13] was rescued by standard procedure [52], [53] from plasmid pA187-Erns346 using site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotide primers. VRPErns carrying a genome with a complete deletion of the Erns gene were described previously. SK-6(Erns) cells express the Erns protein required for the generation of VRPErns by trans-complementation. pA187-1 and pA187-Erns346 plasmids were used as template for PCR amplification. the cloned Erns genes of pJET-Erns and pJET-Erns346 were verified by nucleotide sequencing and then excised with MIuI and Sall. pWPT-Erns and pWPT-Erns346 were ligated into the pW cells were transduced twice with 1100 dilutions of purified lentiviruses. transduction efficiency was found to be over 90% in terms of detectable anti-Erns expression by flow cytometry. SK-6 cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 TCID50/cell. the cells were then added at 40'000 cells/well for 96 well plates. freshly isolated CD172a+ enriched pDC were added to the cultures at 200'000 cells/well of 96-well plates. oligonucleotide probe complement to nucleotides 12242-12193 of the vA187-1 genome sequence. oligonucleotide probe was mixed at 40 nM final concentration with MEM containing 3103 U RNase A/ml as digestion control, with 50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4 as negative control. IFN- detection by ELISA and intracellular staining IFN- was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the mAbs K9 and F17 with a previously published protocol was employed [63] for detection of IFN- by intracellular staining mAbs. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from pigs using ficoll-paque density centrifugation (1.077 g/L, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pDC were enriched as described previously by cell sorting of CD172a+ PBMCs using the magnetic cell sorting system (MACS) with LD columns. this permits a 10-fold enrichment of functional pDC to 2\u20135%. plasmid pA187-Erns346 was generated from pA187-1 using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotide primers. this latter construct was generated from pA187-1 using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotide primers. the plasmids pA187-Erns carrying an in frame deletion of the Erns gene in the pA pA187-E2del373-derived replicon with complete E2 deletion were rescued by transfection of SK-6(E2p7) cell line expressing the CSFV E2 and p7 proteins as described previously [22], [49], [53]. TGEV (TGEV; strain Perdue 115) was propagated in PK15 cells as described previously [56]. the pA187-1 and pA187-Erns346 plasmids were used as template for PCR amplification using primers to insert the restriction sites excising the GFP in the pJET vector. the cloned Erns genes of pJET-Erns and pJET-Erns346 were verified by nucleotide sequencing and then excised with MIuI and Sall and ligated into the pW monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD172a (mAb 74-22-15A), CD14 (CAM36A) and CD4 (mAb 74-12-4 and PT90A) were used. mAb PT90A and CAM36A were purchased from VMRD (Pullman, WA) infectivity was verified and found to be above 90% NS3+ cells following infection with CSFV or VRP at these conditions. freshly isolated CD172a+ enriched pDC were then added to the cultures at 200'000 cells/well of 96-well plates or 1106 per well of 24-well plates. the probes were mixed with 2 volumes of 97% Formamide (Sigma) and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide and 35% urea gel in 133 mM TrisHCl, 45.5 mM boric acid and 3.2 mM EDTA. the effects of various metabolic inhibitors on SK-6 cells was tested by addition of the inhibitor for the last 2 h of infection. pDC were purified by a combined depletion of CD14+ cells followed by CD172a enrichment. monocytes were purified by CD14 cell sorting. both pDC (10% purity) and monocytes (98% purity) were stimulated by MOCK or VRPErns-infected SK-6 cells for 20 h. Figure S3 Viral protein expression in pDC after co-culture with VRPErns-infected SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cells. pDC were stimulated with CpG alone or co-cultured with different numbers of SK-6 or SK-6(Erns) cells. the percentage of NS3+ pDC is shown. SK-6 cells were infected with VRPErns for 24 h, washed and then treated with a DMSO control, nocodazole (5 M), MCD (20 mM) or latrunculin (1 M) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. at 6 and 24 h after drug treatment the cells were harvested."}
