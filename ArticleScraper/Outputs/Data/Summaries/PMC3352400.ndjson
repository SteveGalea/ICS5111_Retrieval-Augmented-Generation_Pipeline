{"summary": "Optimal virulence theory is about three decades old. it assumes that the parasite population has gone to its dynamic equilibrium. selection maximizes the parasite reproductive number, R0. a constant density of susceptible hosts is reasonable whenever the infection is so rare that most hosts have not yet been infected. the per capita rate of pathogen spread is then: (1b) This quantity is a measure of parasite fitness in the epidemic, because it defines how rapidly the parasite spreads. virulence is the sum of a constant host mortality plus virulence. the parasite is confined to a trade-off but is allowed to evolve along the trade-off. the combination of and maximizing parasite fitness during invasion is given by Figure 1. in prior work, the fitness \u2018optimum\u2019 found in this way is usually regarded as the phenotype that the parasite will evolve toward. in the lenski\u2013May model, the optima are temporary, changing as the density of susceptible hosts changes. both prior perspectives essentially restrict evolution to the trade-off function, with an emphasis on optima. selection maximizes the parasite reproductive number, R0. the formula for R0 is simply the parasite fecundity rate times the average lifetime of the infection. the only difference between them lies in the value of S. a constant density of susceptible hosts is reasonable whenever the infection is so rare that most hosts have not yet been infected. the per capita rate of pathogen spread is then: (1b) This quantity is a measure of parasite fitness in the epidemic. the rate of spread is a function of parasite transmission () and the death rate of infected individuals. virulence is the sum of a constant host mortality plus virulence. the parasite is confined to a trade-off but is allowed to evolve along the trade-off. the combination of and maximizing parasite fitness during invasion is given by Figure 1. the parasite optimum maximizes R0 = /, given by the point at which a line through the origin is tangent to the trade-off function. in prior work, the fitness \u2018optimum\u2019 found in this way is usually regarded as the phenotype that the parasite will evolve toward. both prior perspectives essentially restrict evolution to the trade-off function, with an emphasis on optima. the same feature may apply when an established-parasite evolves to overcome host resistance or immunity. invasion criteria are permissive An optimum is best regarded as a long-term endpoint of evolution. highly virulent parasites can invade high host densities even though their virulence is far from optimal. conditions for invasion of a host population of density S* are S* > /, where is virulence and is the transmission rate. evolution at each step could move virulence further or closer to the optimum. mutations (or genetic covariance between transmission and virulence) thus has a major impact on the evolution of virulence in these early stages. evolution following invasion may be slow to attain the optimum following day and proulx (2004). fitness isoclines run parallel to the invasion boundary, so all points on a fitness isocline have the same fitness, assuming that S remains constant. evolution of higher parasite fitness needs not be accompanied by a change in virulence. optimum is best regarded as long-term endpoint of evolution. the population is susceptible to invasion by far more virulent parasites and by far less virulent parasites than those at the optimum. conditions for invasion of a host population of density S* by a parasite with parameters are S* > /, where is virulence and is the transmission rate. evolution would tend to move parasites progressively toward right-most isoclines. but as a mutant\u2019s relative position on the fitness isocline does not affect its fitness, evolution at each step could move virulence further or closer to the optimum (solid point) until the optimum was approached closely. virulence could evolve to deviate further from its optimum during intermediate stages of the adaptation. parasite evolution may be slow to reach the optimum because of (ii), pleiotropy or genetic covariances. selection favors mutations with a higher fitness than the currently dominant strains. mutations may improve transmission but may result in virulence further away from its optimum. population is immune, a large advantage can be gained by parasite mutants. mutants have their own invasion threshold, and depending on their parameters, those constraints may be much more lenient than the constraints applying to parasites unable to escape host immunity. parasites that engender host immunity have the potential to cause repeated invasions, with potential high and devastating virulence each time. the vertical axis (\u2032) now includes the recovery rate of infected hosts as well as mortality rate. the addition of recovery does change the interpretation of the preceding model somewhat. the derivations above remain the same, but the term is no longer just host mortality. instead, the terms are replaced by \u2032, where and is the recovery rate of infected hosts. the evolution of higher \u2032 no longer implies the evolution of higher virulence. the trade-off boundary (between \u2032 and transmission) is given by the black line at the upper boundary of the gray area. \u2032 increases somewhat but host mortality rate decreases. the invasion threshold model is not the only model for nonoptimal virulence. if host and parasite populations cycle, there will be no single virulence optimum. the best the parasite might do is track a moving optimum. experimental adaptation of a parasite with a known optimum may be evolved only slowly. the optimum was predicted when assuming a linear trade-off between lysis time and number of progeny at lysis. the optimum was predicted when assuming a linear trade-off between lysis time and number of progeny at lysis. the bacteriophage study benefited from the fact that the optimality model required only linearity of the trade-off. the slope of the trade-off did not affect the optimum, and even the assumption of this generality appears to have been wrong. the evolutionary approach to this optimum from different starting points then provides insight to the dynamical behavior relevant to the perspective given here. successful vaccines have greatly reduced the incidence of both infections. both viruses are good candidates for the R0 maximization model, but their virulence optima are difficult to establish. alternative to the R0 model have been proposed at least for polio. influenza is typed according to two viral antigens, the hemagglutinin (\u2018H\u2019 type) and neuraminidase (\u2018N\u2019 type); we will limit ourselves here to the different H types. Currently, H1 and H3 are circulating in humans, but H2 was abundant in the past. the virulence of this strain appeared to wane over a few years. the virus disappeared in the 1950s, and its accidental reintroduction to naive hosts did not lead to the high mortality rate of 1918. there may well be many low-virulence variants that go unnoticed. however, the H5N1 strain (bird flu) has a case mortality rate exceeding 50% in humans. multiple strains circulate within a local cat population. cross immunity among strains is only partial. virulent parasites do not die out even when hosts do. the pig virus transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is a highly lethal gut infection of piglets in pig farms. PRCV differs from TGEV by a small deletion and a couple point mutations. it infects the pig respiratory system and is often much less virulent than TGEV. polio and measles viruses we start with two pathogens that elicit host immunity but clearly do not exhibit repeated invasions by mutants that escape immunity. both viruses appear to be good candidates for viruses that violate the invasion threshold model by virtue of their failure to generate escape mutants. viruses have RNA genomes, which are thought to be prone to rapid evolution. polioviruses are known, yet no others have evolved in response to vaccine pressure. flu virus is notorious for its recurrent epidemics in humans. three world-wide flu pandemics of the 1900s were notorious for causing large numbers of infections and thus large numbers of deaths. all were due to viruses that had acquired H types that humans had not previously experienced. not all viruses with novel H types readily spread in humans, however. virulence of H5N1 will rapidly evolve to low levels, if it invades. a large variety of FCV strains circulate concurrently. virulence varies between isolates, from asymptomatic to highly virulent. pigs, chickens, and cattle are housed at high densities and in conditions of stress that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. this artificial maintenance of high host density is in contrast to the usual pattern in epidemiological models that parasites regulate the densities of their hosts. the same buildings and grounds are often used for restocking. the invasion threshold model has shown a progressive evolution toward increasing virulence over four decades. but again, many strains circulate and some have low virulence. the vaccines do not prevent infection and replication by other strains. it would be obvious folly to ignore a case in which the predicted optimum was low virulence but in which a highly virulent parasite could invade and persist. the most useful work at this stage would be to contrast predicted virulence optima with actual virulence levels over time."}
