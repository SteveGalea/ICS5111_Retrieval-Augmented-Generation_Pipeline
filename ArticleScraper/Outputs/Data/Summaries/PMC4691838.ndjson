{"summary": "in humans, 95% of multiexon genes are alternatively spliced. in humans, 95% of multiexon genes are alternatively spliced. splicing events include exon skipping, intron retention, and mutually exclusive splicing. RNA structures between docking site and selector sequence interactions were proposed to ensure that only one variant exon of Dscam is selected by the spliceosome. this mechanism was initially discovered within the exon 6 cluster of Dscam, where the docking site in the intron downstream from constitutive exon 5 could pair with selector sequences upstream of each of the 48 exon 6 variants. et al. 2011 imply that not all of the selections of exon 6 variants may be dependent on the docking site located downstream from constitutive exon 5. further efforts to explore the control mechanism have been hampered by the lack of a sufficient system due to the large size and complexity of the exon cluster. srp gene underwent specific exon duplication in Drosophila (Supplemental Fig. S1) and is subject to mutually exclusive splicing. srp gene underwent specific exon duplication in Drosophila. bidirectional RNA pairing controls alternative exon 4 inclusion in Drosophila srp pre-mRNAs. schematic diagram of partial pre-mRNA, with constitutive exons depicted as black boxes, mutually exclusive exons as cyan boxes, and introns as lines. the dashed arrow represents the formation of the RNA\u2013RNA interaction. exon 4.1 inclusion correlated with downstream RNA pairing strength. data are expressed as percentages of the mean SD from three independent experiments. we tested disruptive and compensatory mutations in the dsRNA stem of the Drosophila srp pre-mRNA. analysis of a series of mutations revealed that the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency was strongly correlated with the strength of upstream RNA pairing. effect of pairing strength on exon 4.2 inclusion was graded. mutations in M3 and M4 nearly abolished exon 4.1 inclusion. RT-PCR products containing exon 4.1 and exon 4.2 spliced together as consequence of simultaneous disruptive mutations. this aberrant splicing is analogous to the inclusion of multiple exon 6 variants in Dscam, which results from the depletion of hrp36. RNA pairings facilitate mutually exclusive splicing fidelity. a cross denotes a disrupting mutation, while the dashed arrow plus a cross represents abolishment of the RNA\u2013RNA interaction. we compared the effects of upstream and downstream RNA pairings on exon 4 selection in the presence or absence of competition from the alternate pairing. we compared the effects of upstream and downstream RNA pairings on exon 4 selection in the presence or absence of competition from stem II. we examined the effect of downstream RNA pairings on exon 4.1 selection in Ud constructs which could not form stem I. weakening the upstream RNA pairing decreased the exon 4.1 inclusion frequency dramatically, whereas strengthening the upstream pairing had the opposite effect. the effect on exon 4 inclusion by simultaneously changing the upstream and downstream pairing strength. C1\u2013C6 denotes the combined mutations on dual pairings (Supplemental Fig. S4C). the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice site motif scores were calculated using the splice site predictor. the splice site of exon 4.2 is significantly stronger than that of exon 4.1. the same trend was seen for \u201cweak to strong\u201d 5\u2032 splice site mutations. this was reinforced by altered splice site strength in combination with disruption of the RNA pairing interaction. splicing of exon 4.1 was partially or largely included even in the absence of downstream RNA pairing. splice site and RNA pairing strengths compensate for each other. the stronger splice site of alternative exon 4.2 allowed for faster recognition and splicing and more frequent inclusion than alternative exon 4.1 in the mature mRNA. et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2011) provides strong evidence that exon 4.1 inclusion is dependent on the formation of downstream pairing to bring splice sites in proximity. a cross in Us or Dd denotes the disrupting mutation. alternative exon 4.2 was included frequently even after the simultaneous disruption of stems I and II. this approximation pattern discrepancy was compatible with the much stronger splice site strength of alternative exon 4.2 than exon 4.1. mutually exclusive splicing was not disrupted within the cluster. the elegant arrangement of intronic elements facilitates the heritable expansion of the control system in accompaniment with bidirectional expansion of exon clusters. this suggests that the dual pairing system faces little regulatory conflict during the evolutionary expansion of an exon cluster. a conserved intronic element downstream from constitutive exon 3 was complementary to an intronic element within alternative exon 4 in 11 hymenopteran species. a conserved intronic element upstream of constitutive exon 5 was complementary to an upstream intronic element. nucleotides with greatest identity to the dual docking sites and selector sequences are shown in different colors. the predicted RNA pairings of Dscam pre-mRNA are indicated on the left or right mutated sequences (M1\u2013M8) compensatory double mutation (M78) to strengthen pairing increased the efficiency of exon 4.1 inclusion up to 80%, much higher than the wild-type level (Fig. 8D,G). analysis of the series of mutations indicates that downstream pairing interaction acts in strength-dependent mode (Fig. 8H). the targeted exons for dsRNA II and V were seldom included in transfection experiments with silkworm cells. however, they are strongly supported by their evolutionary conservation and some compensatory mutations in Danaus plexippus (Supplemental Fig. S8) unusual RNA architectures within the srp exon cluster Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the srp gene underwent specific exon duplication in Drosophila. the srp gene is subject to mutually exclusive splicing. schematic diagram of partial pre-mRNA with constitutive exons depicted as black boxes, mutually exclusive exons as cyan boxes, and introns as lines. the dashed arrow represents the formation of the RNA\u2013RNA interaction. mutants are shown in Supplemental Figure S4A. a minigene construct containing exons 3\u20135 and intervening sequences driven by the inducible metallothionein promoter. mutating the upstream docking sequence (Ud) or the downstream selector (Ds) did not cause a significant decrease in the exon 4 inclusion frequency (M1 and M2, Fig. 1C,D) exon 4.2 inclusion frequency strongly correlated with upstream RNA pairing. effect of pairing strength on exon 4.2 inclusion was graded. mutations in M3 and M4 nearly abolished exon 4.1 inclusion. the results of our mutational analysis were consistent with a proposed molecular switch model that posits competition between upstream and downstream RNA pairings. a small but significant increase in exon 4 skipping was observed when the Ud and Ds sequences were disrupted to abolish stems I and II simultaneously. similar results were obtained using other constructs designed to simultaneously abolish stems I and II simultaneously. simultaneous disruption of upstream and downstream pairing led to aberrant splicing of exon 4. results suggest dual RNA pairings function as inherent cis-acting physical barriers to suppress the in-loop exon. stream and downstream RNA pairings on exon 4 selection in the presence or absence of competition from the alternate pairing. intriguingly, we observed only a slight change in the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency when stem I was disrupted. in contrast, stem I strength had little effect on the selection of the exon 4 variant in the stem II disruption construct. we examined the effect of downstream RNA pairings on exon 4.1 selection. weakening the upstream RNA pairing decreased the exon 4.1 inclusion frequency dramatically. strengthening the upstream pairing had the opposite effect. however, the change was much greater than that in the presence of stem II. 1\u2013C6 denotes the combined mutations on dual pairings. data are expressed as percentages of mean SD from three independent experiments. inclusion of exon 4.2 was generally predominant in all tissues examined. inclusion of exon 4.2 was generally predominant in all tissues examined. using the splice site predictor (Reese et al. 1997), the splice site of exon 4.2 is significantly stronger than that of exon 4.1. Symbols used are the same as those in Figure 1. exon 4.1 is responsible, at least in large part, for the lower frequency of exon 4.1 inclusion. this was reinforced by altered splice site strength in combination with disruption of the RNA pairing interaction. exon 4.2 contained comparatively stronger 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites. two non-sequence-specific RNA pairing guides activated the selection of alternative exon 4. RNA structures must be bound by and interact with regulatory proteins without sequence specificity to mediate the inclusion of alternative exon 4. RNA structures could act as distant upstream and downstream elements via base-pairing. a cross in Us or Dd denotes the disrupting mutation. Symbols used are the same as those in Figure 1. the band marked by \u201c*\u201d is a nonspecific RT-PCR product. splice site strength of exon 4.2 was compatible with stronger splice site strength of alternative exon 4.2 than exon 4.1. results indicated that upstream pairing acted to enhance exon 4.2 splicing rate and efficiency by bringing splice sites in proximity, thereby resulting in striking preferences in competition with downstream-pairing-dependent exon 4.1 splicing. the dual pairing system faces little regulatory conflict during the evolutionary expansion of an exon cluster. this suggests the dual pairing system faces little regulatory conflict during the evolutionary expansion of an exon cluster. a conserved intronic element downstream from constitutive exon 3 was complementary to an intronic element within alternative exon 4 in 11 hymenopteran species. a conserved intronic element upstream of constitutive exon 5 was complementary to an upstream intronic element. the deletion constructs were used to test the effects of RNA pairing on splicing in silkworm cells. effects of bidirectional RNA pairings on exon 4 inclusion are indicated for disruptive single mutations (M1\u2013M8) and compensatory double mutations (M12; M34; M56; M78). the band marked by \u201c*\u201d is a nonspecific RT-PCR product. analysis of the series of mutations indicates that downstream pairing interaction acts in strength-dependent mode (Fig. 8H). analysis of the series of mutations indicates that downstream pairing interaction acts in strength-dependent mode (Fig. 8H). results demonstrate that bidirectional RNA pairings control Dscam exon 4 inclusion in A. mellifera. experimentally demonstrated their proposed structures. however, they are strongly supported by their evolutionary conservation. this architecture is evolutionarily conserved in hymenopteran species. study explores the role of the unprecedented architecture of RNA\u2013RNA interactions in mutually exclusive splicing. RNA architectures identified in our study were not predicted by in silico approaches (Pervouchine 2014), nor were they detected using recent high-throughput RNA structure sequencing techniques. either of the docking sites alternately interacts with their selector sequence. for example, the RNA pairing interaction functions to promote the recognition of the weak splice site, activating the splicing of exon B1 to constitutive exon C. no precedent exists for a requirement for a long-range pseudoknot structure governing specific exon inclusion in a mutually exclusive mode. inclusion of a single exon 4 is similar to the WT in the disruption of alternate pairing. simultaneous strengthening or weakening of both pairs to similar degrees had no remarkable effect on exon 4 selection. splice site strength, intronic distance from selector element to splice site likely to play an important role in pairing-mediated selection of an alternative exon. bidirectional RNA pairings would be advantageous for evolutionary expansion of exon clusters. the dual-docking-site model of this study could provide a reasonable explanation for its control mechanism in such an evolutionary expansion. any mutation in the single docking site would influence the interaction with the selector sequences. this suggests that dual docking sites probably are much better able to tolerate this deleterious mutation.
