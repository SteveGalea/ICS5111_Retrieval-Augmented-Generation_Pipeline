{"summary": "bacterial pathogens Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) can invade the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier to cause septicaemia and meningitis. non-typable Hi (NTHi) are associated with localized respiratory tract and conjunctival infections. all CEACAMs have an N-terminal IgV-like domain and variable numbers of IgC2-like A and B domains. targeting of CEACAMs by N. gonorrhoeae leads to cellular invasion and passage across polarized monolayers. Nm and N. gonorrhoeae contain multiple copies of Opa genes. the majority of the Opa proteins are capable of targeting CEACAMs. the diverse ligands of neisseria and haemophilus bind to an overlapping site. a three-dimensional structural model of the human CEACAM1 N-domain has been previously generated based on other Ig family molecules. the results suggest that substitutions at positions 34 and 89 at the core of the binding region may affect bacterial access to the implicated key binding residue Ile-91. the data suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms in individuals or populations that may introduce substitutions in CEACAM sequence particularly at the bacterial binding site. a crystal structure of murine soluble CEACAM1a domains 1 and 4 was reported. the CC\u2032 loop that contains Val-39 folds back against the CFG face. further examination of this model suggested that the bacterial binding pocket forms a rather flat surface in the centre of the CFG face. atom colouring (C-green, O-red, N-blue) show increased hydrophobic nature of binding site around I91 in mutant structures. substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at three sites (91, 34 and 89) on the N-domain. sequences of the strands making up the \u2018CFG\u2019 face of the CEACAM receptors are shown. YTH71.3, A0115 and Kat4c bound to various receptor constructs. AO115 and Kat4c supported binding to the native NA1B-Fc molecule. Q89A and Q89N completely abrogated the antibody binding. all the Nm isolates showed reduced binding to the soluble receptor. I91T substitution either did not affect binding (OpaB and OpaX) or reduced binding by 50\u201360% (OpaA and OpaA) binding to soluble receptor Q89N is lower than native CC1 in dot-blots. binding to soluble receptor Q89N is relatively high on certain cells. soluble Q89N inhibited bacterial binding to CHO-CC1 (C) haemophilus influenzae binding to CEACAM1 constructs 1 non-typable (A950002) and 2 THi strains (Rd and Eagan) were used in receptor overlay experiments. substitutions of Ile-91 for Ala or Thr abrogated binding of all three strains. however, substitution I91L reduced binding only of the THi strain Eagan. no binding was observed using lysates prepared from bacteria known to lack surface ligands for CEACAMs. Hi strains primarily require Ile-91 to enable receptor targeting. removal of OH (Y34F) provides a more favourable environment. binding relative to the native receptor was determined as in legend to Fig. 3. receptor constructs with Q89N substitution have the capacity to increase the binding of some Hi over that of Nm. hi-aeg strain Ha3 and Nm C751OpaB variant dotted onto a single nitrocellulose strip were overlaid with 0.5 ml of BSA-PBST containing either native NA1B-Fc construct (A) or that with Q89N substitution (B) at the concentrations indicated. the situation is reversed in the presence of the Q89N construct. binding of anti-CEACAM antibodies to COS cells transfected with selected CEACAM constructs was detected by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC or FITC. 'Neo' are control cells transfected using the neomycin vector. the ability of the soluble native (CC1-Fc) or CC1(Q89N)-Fc to inhibit bacterial binding was assessed using C751OpaB bacteria. despite low levels of binding of the isolate to the soluble CC1 construct, bacterial binding to the homologous native structure expressed on CHO cells was clearly visible. CC1(Q89N)-Fc does compete with the cell-expressed homologous receptor when the levels of receptor expression are low and adherent bacterial numbers are thus also also low. the data emphasize the importance of cell presentation of receptor in addition to receptor structure in bacterial interactions. a 2D Opa protein structure (B) and relationship of the three variable domains of strain C751 Opa proteins are shown. SV, semivariable domains of strain C751 Opa-A, -B and -D are identical as are the hypervariable structures HV1 of OpaA and OpaB. the hypervariable loops HV1 and HV2 of Opa proteins have been implicated in the binding of CEACAMs. soluble CEACAM1a domains 1 and 4 was reported. we have remodelled the human CEACAM1 N-domain. the CC\u2032 loop that contains Val-39 folds back against the CFG face. further examination suggested that the bacterial binding pocket forms a rather flat surface in the centre of the CFG face. binding site around I91 in mutant structures coloured according to hydrophobicity. substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at three sites (91, 34 and 89) on the N-domain. sequences of the strands making up the \u2018CFG\u2019 face of the CEACAM receptors are shown. AO115 and Kat4c bound to various receptor constructs and to the native NA1B-Fc molecule with equal efficiency. YTH71.3, Leu but not Thr at position 91 supported binding to the same extent as Ile. Q89A and Q89N completely abrogated the antibody binding. all the Nm isolates showed reduced binding to the soluble receptor with Y34A and I91A substitutions. Q89A affected OpaD binding most significantly confirming previous studies. binding to cell-expressed receptors was detected using anti-Nm antisera and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. binding to soluble receptor Q89N is much lower than native CC1 in dot-blots. two THi strains (Rd and Eagan) were used in receptor overlay experiments. substitutions of Ile-91 for Ala or Thr abrogated binding of all three strains. however, substitution I91L reduced binding only of the THi strain Eagan. hi strains primarily require Ile-91 to enable receptor targeting. removal of the OH (Y34F) provides a more favourable environment. lysates prepared from bacteria known to lack surface ligands for CEACAMs. binding relative to the native receptor was determined as in legend to Fig. 3. receptor constructs with Q89N substitution have the capacity to increase the binding of some Hi over that of Nm. previous investigations have shown that certain isolates are capable of competing with the native receptor. hi-aeg strain Ha3 and Nm C751OpaB variant dotted onto a single nitrocellulose strip were overlaid with 0.5 ml of BSA-PBST containing either native NA1B-Fc construct (A) or that with Q89N substitution (B) at the concentrations indicated. binding of anti-CEACAM antibodies to COS cells transfected with selected CEACAM constructs was detected by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC or FITC. 'Neo' are control cells transfected using the neomycin vector. the ability of the soluble native (CC1-Fc) or CC1(Q89N)-Fc to inhibit bacterial binding was assessed using C751OpaB bacteria. despite the low levels of binding of the isolate to the soluble CC1 construct, bacterial binding to the homologous native structure expressed on CHO cells was clearly visible. the data emphasize the importance of cell presentation of receptor in addition to receptor structure in bacterial interactions. the final outcome depends on the balance between the effects exerted by residue substitutions and receptor density. SV, semivariable domains of strain C751 Opa-A, -B and -D are identical as are the hypervariable structures HV1 of OpaA and OpaB and the HV2 of OpaB and OpaD. the hypervariable loops HV1 and HV2 of Opa proteins have been implicated in the binding of CEACAMs. different strains of typable and NTHi lineages also bind to the CFG face of the N-domain of CEACAM1. a similar situation occurs on the mouse CEACAM1a (MHVR1a) N-terminal domain. in murine CEACAM1, the protruding Ile-41 is surrounded by a number of surface exposed charged residues. mutations introduced at position 91 in the human receptor support the requirement for a hydrophobic pocket at this site. only I91L was more frequently tolerated. both Val-39 and Gly-41 have been implicated in bacterial binding from alanine scanning and homologue scanning mutagenesis. the remodelling shown here of CEACAM1 produces the convoluted structure of the CC\u2032 loop relocating Val-39 close to Ile-91. however, Y34A frequently abrogated receptor recognition. d binding to I91A and Q89A/N-substituted receptors expressed in transfected COS cells. only a proportion (c. 50%) of cells with very high levels of I91A receptors had significant numbers of bacteria attached. point mutations of CEACAMs can decrease and increase bacterial load. morphisms that affect host susceptibility may be found at various sites in the genes encoding host receptors targeted by pathogens. some SNPs may lead to multiple and diverse downstream effects, e.g. altered transcriptional response and manifestation of disease. changes such as Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile in the extracellular domains of TLR4 have been implicated in increased risk to bacterial infections. this is the only major difference between CC1 and CEA that could affect bacterial binding. the mutation Q89H in CC1 would be expected to produce CEA-like binding pattern and could affect tropism of the bacteria as observed for CEA. both Nm and Hi CEACAM-binding ligands (Opa and P5) are known to undergo antigenic variation. in any population, antigenic/structural variants are present and may be selected for during host colonization and subsequent pathogenesis. opportunistic pathogens such as Y > F and Q > N target CEACAM1. occurrence of such receptor polymorphisms in the human population could lead to greater bacterial binding thus increasing the chances of cellular invasion. mutagenesis of the pIG construct containing the DNA encoding the CEACAM1 NA1B domains described previously. some primer sequences have been published previously (Watt et al., 1994).
