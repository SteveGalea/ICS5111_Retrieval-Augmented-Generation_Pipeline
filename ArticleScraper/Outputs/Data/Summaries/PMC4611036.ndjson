{"summary": "iDVGs naturally generated in vivo trigger potent lung antiviral immunity. mouse cells were infected either with SeV C containing high levels of copy-back iDVGs (SeV HD) or with SeV C depleted of iDVGs (SeV LD) or left untreated (N/T) and reinfected 6 h later with the unrelated IAV. IFNB1 mRNA expression and ratio of positive/negative-sense DVG RNA copy numbers determined by RT-qPCR from A549 cells infected with SeV HD at an MOI of 1.5 TCID50/cell. Experiments independently repeated at least three times. each assay was performed in triplicate. a predominant iDVG (DVG-546) present during infection with SeV HD (12, 34) correlated copy numbers of negative-sense DVG strands with IFNB1 mRNA expression. increased ratio of positive- to negative-sense DVG strands positively correlated with the induction of IFNB1 expression in infected human A549 cells. mutant DVG retained a shorter 5\u2032 internal sequence (DVG-268). mutant DVGs lacking either the complete internal sequence (DVG-200) or both complementary sequences (DVG-IS) showed a reduced ability to stimulate antiviral genes upon transfection into both mouse and human cells. this differential activity of mutant DVGs was sustained over a 24 h time course. a temperature of 37\u00b0C was chosen to determine structures based on minimal free energy. the candidate motif (DVG70-114) is circled. the AU content of DVG70-114 is shown in the inset. we modeled in silico the folding of mutant DVGs with either a strong or a weak ability to induce type I IFN expression. we excluded the 3\u2032 complementary sequence of the constructs because long complementarities strongly interfere with modeling based on minimal free energy. we identified a candidate stem-loop structure formed by nt 70 to 114 (DVG70-114) of DVG-546 that was observed only in mutant DVGs showing strong stimulatory ability. the difference was recapitulated in murine cells and sustained at the RNA and protein levels over a 24 h time course. a reduced ability to induce IFN production was also observed in DVG-54670-114. to further confirm the stimulatory role of DVG70-114, we introduced point mutations into this motif. infection with rDVG-324 stimulated significantly higher levels of IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA expression in LLC-MK2 cells. the viral protein and DVG RNA expression levels were equivalent (Fig. 3B). these data show that DVG70-114 functions to enhance the antiviral response during infection, demonstrating its biological relevance. LL-CMK2 cells were infected with SeV LD at an MOI of 1.5 TCID50/cell. expression of SeV NP and SeV (P/V) (C) and antiviral genes (D) was measured at 6 h posttransfection. the 3\u2032 complementary end of iDVG RNA is not required for maximum IFN induction. we deleted the complete 3\u2032 complementary sequence (94 nucleotides [nt] from DVG-324. both mutants showed higher potency than DVG-546. expression of IFNB1 mRNA by RT-qPCR in LLC-MK2 cells transfected for 6 h with 4.15 pmol of the ivtDVG indicated. the sequence of DVG5-51 is shown below the construct. Stabilization of the DVG70-114 motif enhances its stimulatory potential. we cloned the motif into the X region of HCV. the motif confers strong immunostimulatory activity to inert RNA molecules. tDVG RNA X region DVG70-114 (X region-based mutant that includes DVG70-114) led to strong expression of IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA. X region DVG70-114 also demonstrated an ability to stimulate antiviral gene expression equivalent to that of HCV poly(U/UC) (13). if the DVG70-114 motif augmented the binding of DVG RNA to RIG-I, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with DVG RNA exposed to purified RIG-I proteins that binds to RIG-I. lacked the signaling domain (RIG-I deltaCARD) we tested the binding affinity of RIG-I for iDVGs with or without DVG70-114 motif (DVG-268) in the absence or presence of ATP, which promotes RIG-I polymerization upon association with RNA. expression of IFNB1 mRNA by RT-qPCR of LLC-MK2 cells transfected for 6 h with 4.15 pmol of DVG-268 not treated (NT) or treated with RNase A, V1, A/V1 or mock transfected. all experiments in panel A to E were independently repeated at least three times. TC-1 mouse lung epithelial cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. they were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin or penicillin and streptomycin. all cell lines were treated with mycoplasma removal agent (MP Biomedicals) a second KpnI site at position 448 of the wild-type DVG internal sequence allowed the deletion of a 228-nt-long fragment of DVG. motif DVG70-114 and DVG5-51 deletions, single-nucleotide swaps, and nucleotides additions (motif1+) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL; Agilent Technologies) ivtDVG-expressing plasmids were linearized and in vitro transcribed with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Fermentas) RNA products were treated with DNase and then precipitated with LiCl. a 4.15-pmol portion of the structured RNA was transfected into 2.5 105 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as controls, cells were transfected with an equally molarity of high-molecular-weight poly (I:C) RT-qPCR was performed as previously described. 1 g of RNA was reverse transcribed with the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. a pool of 32 oligonucleotides targeting the positive-sense SeV genome was designed as previously described. RNA FISH was performed according to published protocols, with minor modifications. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. imaging quantification was performed with the Volocity Quantitation module (PerkinElmer) (49) the fluorescent signal from the nuclei of cells was selected by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around each nucleus. the average ROI intensity of IRF3 and positive-sense DVG signals in mock-infected cells was measured. YBR gold (Life Technologies) and fluorescent gel images were recorded and analyzed with the gel Doc XR+ imaging system (Bio-Rad) ELISA. IFN- in the supernatant of ivtDVG RNA-transfected TC-1 cells was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. total RNA (1 g) isolated 12 h after infection was reverse transcribed for either positive- or negative-sense DVG. dilutions were analyzed for RT-qPCR, and cycle threshold values were graphed relative to the log10 of the number of picograms of initial RNA. RT-qPCR data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH for LL-CMK2 cells and Rps11 for TC-1 cells. one representative experiment out of three is shown. two representative transfections of LL-CMK2 cells are shown (EXPs 1 and 2). Data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH. data are the mean the standard error of the mean of all of the experiments (total n = 3 to 5/group). data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH. EMSA of DVG-268 and DVG-26870-114 lack immunostimulatory motif DVG70-114. EMSA of DVG-268 and DVG-200 lack immunostimulatory motif DVG70-114 in the presence of increasing doses of MDA5 deltaCARD."}
