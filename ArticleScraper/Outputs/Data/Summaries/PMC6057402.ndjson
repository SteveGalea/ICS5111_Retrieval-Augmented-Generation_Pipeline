{"summary": "many countries where infectious diseases had been considered controlled in past decades are reporting the invasion of some exotic and frequently unknown infectious diseases. a particular tragic invasion occurred in the beginning of the last century when between 50 and 100 million individuals worldwide died victims of the Spanish flu. in 2009 the swine flu pandemic (H1N1) frightened the world. international arrivals worldwide are expected to increase by 3.3% per year from 2010 to 2030 to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. many imported diseases may go unnoticed because of a high frequency of asymptomatic cases that may also contribute to the transmission of diseases. the model assumes that a density of infected individual, IHT(0), arrived at t = t0 and remains infective for a period of (H + H + H)1weeks. if the region where these infected travellers arrive had an area A the number of them is IHT(0)A. the total number of measles cases, Measlescases, infected by these travellers, one year after its introduction ( = 52 weeks), is given by M to calculate this risk, we assumed a nonhomogeneous simple birth process [25] which describes the introduction of the disease. the probability generating function of such process is P(x, t) = nPn(t)xn. in this case the incidence of the infection is defined as (t) = (IHT(t)SH(t)/NH) the risk (probability) of having no infected individuals is R i s k m e a s l e s 0, t = t a (4b) in (4a) and (4b) t = 1 1 e t + 0 t t 0 e d, t = 1 e t e t + 0 t t t 0 e d. the case of measles in Europe In 2017, Europe reported more than 21,000 cases of measles. this represents a fourfold increase from 2016 when just 5,273 cases were reported. this outbreak was due to two factors: first, there was an overall decline in routine immunization coverage. assuming a vaccination coverage of 80%, it is possible to estimate the risk of measles introduction by considering the effective reproduction number R(t) = R0(SH(t)/NH), where R0 = /(H + H + H) is the basic reproduction number. this is because the basic reproduction number of measles is around 25 and therefore R(t) = R0(SH(t)/NH) = 250.2 = 5. seven infected immigrants would guarantee the invasion of measles in Italy. it is possible, although very laborious, to backcalculate how many infected immigrants would be necessary to generate the observed 4,885 cases in 2007. table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in this section as well as their biological meaning. we simulated a SIR model, described in Appendix, with the parameters as in Table 1. the results represent the relative variation in Measlescases, when we vary the parameters by 1%. the risk of measles invasion is less sensitive to the duration of the infection in the traveller, 1/H, than to the potentially infective rate. the highest number of measles cases since 1 January 2017 were reported in Romania (8,274), italy (4,885), and germany (919) the measles vaccination coverage is less than 84% (well below the herd immunity threshold of 95%). the 95% CI for the number secondary cases is (0.89 - 1.40) in other words, one secondary case will be produced by a single traveller with confidence interval between 0.89 and 1.40 cases per unit area. the result is that seven infected immigrants would guarantee the invasion of measles in Italy. in this section we calculate the sensitivity of the risk to the model's parameters. as the risk is dependent only on the \u201cbirth rate\u201d of the infection, we calculate the sensitivity to the integral of this variable, that is, the number of cases. in case 1, we assume that a density of infected individuals arrives at t = t0. in case 1, we assume that the infected travellers infectiousness lasts on average 1/(H + H + H) times units. the incidence of the infection for the mosquitoes is given by L M t = a c S M t N H I H T t t 0 t t 0 (10) In (10) the number of susceptible mosquitoes SM(t) is obtained by solving d S M t d t = a c I H t + I H T t S M t N H + M N M S M t + d N M d t (1 the risk of having no infected individuals is R i s k Z I K V 0, t = t a (14) and the risk (probability) of having no infected individuals is R i s k Z I K V 0, t = t a. the risk of invasion, RiskZIKV(t), is defined as the probability of infected traveller will produce at least one secondary infection throughout the mosquitoes population along his/her infectiousness period. the risk of invasion is defined as the probability of infected traveller will produce at least one secondary infection throughout the mosquitoes population. the 95% CI for the number of infected mosquitoes produced by one infective traveller is (0.21-5.44) one infected mosquito will be produced with confidence interval between 0.21 and 5.44 mosquitoes per unit area. the structure of both the Kermack-Mackendrick model [26] and the Ross-Macdonald model [18] for the second case are well known. the risk of invasion is orders of magnitude more sensitive to the biting rate and the probability of transmission from human to mosquitoes than the duration of the infection in the traveller. the risk of invasion, RiskZIKV(t), is defined as the probability of infected traveller will produce at least one secondary infection throughout the mosquitoes population along his infectiousness period. the structure of both the Kermack-Mackendrick model [26] and the Ross-Macdonald model [18] for the second case are well known. the risk is dependent only on the force of the infection, we calculate the sensitivity of the integral of this variable. the incidence of infection is defined as LM(t) = abIM(t)(SH(t)/NH). we present two probabilistic models that intend to provide risks estimations of infectious diseases introduction into previously unaffected countries/regions. we analyse two distinct situations, one dealing with a direct transmitted infection and one dealing with a vector-borne infection. this model allows the calculation that one single infective traveller arriving in a previously uninfected area produces one secondary, autochthonous case along his/her infectiousness period. in the case of measles in Europe 2017, this chance is low (7.0%) even though we consider only a single infected traveller arriving in a very large area. the expected number of infected travellers that seeded measles in 2017 estimated by (4a) resulted in only 7 infective travellers that would be necessary to guarantee that measles would invade Italy. the main limitation of both models presented in this note is the assumption of homogeneously mixing population. according to this assumption, an infected traveller would have the same probability of interact with any susceptible individual of the local population. this is very unlikely to be the case in real outbreaks. the parameters appearing in the model were described in Table 1 of the main text. we then calculated the total number of cases produced by one infected traveller, according to M e s l e s c a s e s = 0 I H T t S H t N H d t. the model is defined by the following: d S H t d t = a b I M t S H t N H + H N H S H t + H I H t d t = H + H + H I H t d t = H + H + H I H t d t = H I H t + I H T t d R H t d t = a c S M t I H conflict of interest The authors declare that there are conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper."}
