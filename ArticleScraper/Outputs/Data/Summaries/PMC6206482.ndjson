{"summary": "coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), are all capable of inducing significant ER stress following infection. IRE1 activation initiates diverse downstream signaling of the UPR either through splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) or through posttranscriptional modifications via coronaviruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to counteract the IFN-I response (20\u201323) at least 11 viral proteins of the coronaviruses have been identified as IFN-I antagonists (20, 23, 24) TGEV induces high levels of IFN-I in vivo and in vitro after infection (25\u201327). TGEV infection downregulated the expression of host miR-30a-5p via virally triggered IRE1-mediated UPR induction. miR-30a-5p suppressed TGEV infection by enhancing the IFN-induced antiviral signaling pathway by directly targeting the negative regulators of IFN signaling, SOCS1 and SOCS3. RESULTS TGEV infection downregulates miR-30a-5p expression. the host miR-30 family plays important roles in cancers and viral infections. ER stress may inhibit miR-30a-5p expression. TGEV infection at an MOI of 1 caused a typical cytopathic effect. the miR-30a-5p reduction occurred after 12 hpi and then gradually decreased up to 48 hpi. TGEV infection in ST cells was confirmed by quantifying the viral genomes. the levels of miR-30a-5p (D) and TGEV infection (C) in ST cells were measured by RT-qPCR at 24 hpi at different MOIs. the results from three independent experiments are shown. TGEV infection suppressed miR-30a-5p expression in vivo. avirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (41), TGEV infection caused substantial cytoplasmic cleavage of the XBP1u transcript into the XBP1s transcription factor starting at 24 hpi. IRE1 activation was further confirmed by analyzing the expression of the XBP1s downstream target gene. IRE1 to miR-30a-5p expression was knocked down by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) the efficiency of IRE1 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting. the silencing of IRE1 by siRNAs significantly rescued the decreased miR-30a-5p induced by TGEV infection. the ratio of band intensities for spliced and total XBP1 DNA in the infected cells was normalized to that in the mock-infected cells. the relative expression of ERdj4 normalized to that of GAPDH following TGEV infection was measured and is presented. miR-30a-5p suppresses TGEV propagation. IRE1 knockdown by siIRE1#3 significantly reduced TGEV replication. siIRE1#1 and siIRE1#2 also exhibited a tendency to decrease TGEV propagation. ST cells were transfected with IRE1 siRNA or the scrambled control siRNA (siRNA NC) at 100 nM, followed by infection with TGEV (MOI = 0.01); TGEV RNA (C) and titers (D) were quantified at 24 hpi. TGEV infection was measured at 24 hpi. *, P 0.05. miR-30a-5p mimics decreased the TGEV genome quantity and progeny viral titer by up to 17-fold. inhibition of TGEV by preexisting miR-30a-5p mimics was dose dependent. the suppression of endogenous miR-30a-5p by the miR-30a-5p inhibitor significantly abrogated 48c-mediated TGEV suppression compared with that achieved with the NC-i. IRE1 enhances TGEV replication by decreasing miR-30a-5p abundance. TGEV infection elicited a substantial amount of IFN- production at 24 hpi. overexpression of miR-30a-5p did not significantly increase IFN- production. miR-30a-5p does not modulate TGEV-induced IFN-I production. the ISRE reporter vector and pRL-TK were cotransfected with the indicated miR-30a-5p mimics, NC mimics, miR-30a-5p inhibitor, or NC inhibitor. cells were harvested for luciferase (luc) assay at 12 h after IFN- stimulation. the binding of IFN-I to the IFN-I receptor activates the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway and induces hundreds of ISGs to inhibit viral infection. to verify our hypothesis that miR-30a-5p hinders TGEV replication largely by enhancing IFN-I antiviral signaling cascades. miR-30a-5p mimics significantly enhanced the activity of ISRE stimulated by IFN--derived ISRE activity. compared with the NC inhibitor (NC-i), the miR-30a-5p inhibitor suppressed IFN-derived ISRE activity. miR-30a-5p enhanced IFN-I antiviral signaling compared with NC mimics. overexpression of miR-30a-5p reduced TGEV infection by more than 100-fold. inhibition of endogenous miR-30a-5p significantly increased TGEV infection and decreased the efficiency of IFN-in suppressing TGEV infection. mutant vector was constructed to eliminate possible recognition by replacing five seed nucleotides. overexpression of miR-30a-5p in ST cells decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the SOCS1 or SOCS3 wild-type target sequence but not that of the luciferase reporter containing the mutant target site of SOCS1 or SOCS3. miR-30a-5p targets the 3\u2032 UTRs of SOCS1 and SOCS3. the predicted target sites and mutated target sites of miR-30a-5p are underlined. luciferase activity was analyzed at 30 h after transfection. the samples were fected as described in the legend to panel C for 24 h. the expression of SOCS1 (I) and SOCS3 (J) in the ilea after TGEV infection was quantified by RT-qPCR. TGEV infection downregulated miR-30a-5p expression through activation of IRE1. TGEV infection significantly elevated expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in ST cells at 24 hpi. increased expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 began at 12 hpi. increased expression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 disrupts the IFN-I antiviral response. TGEV-derived suppression of miR-30a-5p facilitates TGEV infection via modulation of IFN-I signaling by SOCS1 and SOCS3. overexpression of SOCS1 suppressed p-STAT1, IFN- antiviral activity, and TGEV infection more efficiently than did overexpression of SOCS3. the knockdown efficiency of SOCS1 siRNAs (siSOCS1s) and SOCS3 siRNAs was confirmed by Western blotting. ST cells were transfected as indicated with pCAGGS-HA, pCAGGS-SOCS1 or pCAGGS-SOCS3 for 48 h. the transient expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 was confirmed by IFA with anti-HA staining. ST cells were transfected with siSOCS1#1, siSOCS3#3 or the scrambled control siRNA for 24 h. the cells were infected with TGEV (MOI = 0.01) and harvested for quantification of TGEV infection at 24 hpi. IRE1 facilitates TGEV infection by modulating the miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis. TGEV-activated IRE1 decreased levels of miR-30a-5p. miR-30a-5p directly targeted SOCS family proteins and downregulated expression. suppression of IRE1 by 48c promoted STAT1 activation. IRE1 enhances TGEV infection through miR-30a-5p/SOCS-mediated disruption of the JAK-STAT1 pathway. results suggest that IRE1 enhances TGEV infection through miR-30a-5p/SOCS-mediated disruption of the JAK-STAT1 pathway. blockage of STAT1 activation rescued the viral suppression of 48c. ST cells were pretreated with 100 M 48c for 2 h or 100 M 48c for 2 h plus 10 M fludarabine (Flud) for 24 h. then, the TGEV titer (A) was measured at 24 hpi. ST cells were transfected with 100 nM siIFNAR1#1 or scrambled control siRNA for 24 h, followed by incubation with IFN- for 24 h. the cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis of ISG15, OASL, or MxA expression relative to that of GAPDH. treatment with the ER stress inducer thapsigargin (Tg) significantly diminished miR-30a-5p abundance. TGEV infection triggers significant ER stress and initiates all three UPR pathways (1, 8) TGEV infection in the ileum was confirmed by quantifying TGEV RNA. the results demonstrate that TGEV infection decreases miR-30a-5p expression. the miR-30a-5p levels in ST cells were measured by RT-qPCR. IRE1-mediated UPR induction inhibits miR-30a-5p expression. IRE1 has the ability to degrade miRNAs, in addition to degrading mRNA under ER stress. IRE1 activation by TGEV infection was assessed. activation was triggered by TGEV infection (Fig. 1D and 2A) the findings suggest that activation may involve decreased miR-30a-5p expression during TGEV infection. activated IRE1 is responsible for the downregulation of miR-30a-5p. IRE1 activation by TGEV infection was analyzed by PCR amplification of total XBP1 cDNA and further digestion with PstI. the sizes of the PCR-amplified fragments from spliced and unspliced XBP1 DNA in ST cells infected with TGEV at an MOI of 1 for various time points or treated with Tg (1 M) for 24 h are also listed. the results are presented as the relative expression of miR-30a-5p in ST cells normalized to that of miR-30a-5p in the mock-infected control cells. IRE1 knockdown (F) or miR-30a-5p expression (G, H) rescued miR-30a-5p suppression following TGEV infection or Tg treatment. the observed levels of TGEV reduction were correlated with the knockdown efficiency of IRE1 siRNAs. the inhibition of IRE1 by 48c suppressed TGEV infection (MOI = 1) in ST cells. miR-30a-5p suppressed TGEV replication at the late stages of infection. TGEV infection was analyzed at 2, 6, 12, 24, or 36 hpi. the miR-30a-5p inhibitor rescued TGEV suppression by 48c. 80 nM and 160 nM miR-30a-5p mimics (P 0.001) also decreased TGEV infection. suppression of TGEV infection by miR-30a-5p was further confirmed by a TGEV nucleocapsid protein immunofluorescence assay (IFA) miR-30a-5p enhances IFN-I antiviral signaling cascades. TGEV efficiently replicates in cells, despite significant amounts of IFN-I production after infection (25, 26), indicating some mechanisms are exploited by TGEV to escape IFN-I-induced antiviral responses. ST cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 1 for 36 h. TGEV infection impaired IFN-I-elicited STAT1 signaling. cells were lysed and collected for Western blotting of pSTAT1, STAT1 or -actin. samples were collected at 24 h after TGEV infection or IFN- stimulation. quantifications were normalized to those for the mock-treated and uninfected NC. miR-30a-5p enhanced the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-. FN-I antiviral signaling cascades are undermined during the later stage of TGEV infection. compared with uninfected control cells, TGEV-infected cells exhibited a significant reduction in IFN--elicited STAT1 phosphorylation (p-STAT1). miR-30a-5p overexpression greatly upregulated expression of antiviral ISG genes in response to either TGEV infection or IFN- stimulation. overexpression of miR-30a-5p significantly promoted p-STAT1 levels. inhibition of endogenous miR-30a-5p decreased p-STAT1 levels. miR-30a-5p could potentially target SOCS1 and SOCS3 through a 3\u2032 UTR site that is conserved in mammals. the members of the SOCS family of proteins are endogenous potent negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling transduction. miR-30a-5p targets the 3\u2032 UTRs of SOCS1 and SOCS3. the miR-30a-5p mimics significantly decreased the transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in ST cells. the diminished expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 induced by miR-30a-5p overexpression was verified by Western blotting. luciferase activity was analyzed at 30 h after transfection. expression levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were analyzed by RT-qPCR. treatment with 48c abolished upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression. ST cells were transfected with 160 nM miR-30a-5p inhibitor for 24 h. followed by infection with TGEV (MOI = 1). expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the ilea at 48 hpi was quantified. 48c pretreatment strongly decreased the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in ST cells following TGEV infection. the reduction in SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression by 48c was counteracted by the miR-30a-5p inhibitor. increased expression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 disrupts the IFN-I antiviral response and facilitates TGEV replication. the elevated expression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 suppresses the p-STAT1 induced by either IFN-I-activated JAK-STAT1 signaling by either SOCS1 or SOCS3. transient expression of SOCS1 dampened the anti-TGEV activity of IFN- but significantly elevated the levels of TGEV genomes only. silencing of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in non-IFN-stimulated ST cells greatly decreased TGEV titers by up to 10-fold. the silencing of SOCS1 enhanced the IFN-mediated antiviral response and hindered TGEV infection more efficiently than did the knockdown of SOCS3. ST cells were harvested for Western blotting of pSTAT1, STAT1, or -actin after 24 h. cells were harvested for quantification of TGEV infection at 24 h. ST cells were transfected with siSOCS1#1, siSOCS3#3 or the scrambled control siRNA for 24 h. cells were harvested for quantification of TGEV infection at 24 hpi. ire1 facilitates TGEV infection by modulating the miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis. disruption of 48c-mediated enhancement of STAT1 signaling by fludarabine significantly rescued TGEV suppression by 48c. inhibition of STAT1 activation by fludarabine was confirmed by Western blotting for p-STAT1 and total STAT1. RNA control was further confirmed by the reduction in ISG expression (ISG15, OASL, and MxA) after IFN- stimulation. no inhibitory effect of miR-30a-5p on TGEV was observed in IFNAR1-slienced ST cells. IRE1 enhances TGEV infection through miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis. ST cells were harvested for RT-qPCR analysis of IFNAR1 expression at 48 h after transfection with 100 nM siRNAs or scrambled control siRNA (siCtrl) the cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis of IFNAR1 expression. DISCUSSION IFN-I has vital roles in the host innate immunity response. coronaviruses have evolved diverse strategies to counter the antiviral activity of IFN-I during infection. ER stress is a common outcome in coronavirus-infected cells. many viruses have evolved strategies to employ IRE1 signaling to facilitate their infection. the inhibition of IRE1 by specific IRE1 inhibitors or siRNA decreases the replication of IAV, JEV, and hepatitis C virus. however, the mechanisms by which IRE1 facilitates viral infection remain elusive. TGEV infection is sensitive to IFN-I activity. TGEV has several strategies to antagonize IFN-I signaling. this information is consistent with our finding that TGEV impairs IFN-I JAK-STAT1 signaling at the late stage of infection. a paper published by Xu and colleagues revealed that miR-30a-5p directly targets the 3\u2032 UTR of SOCS3 and manipulates the expression of SOCS3 in mouse B cell lymphoma (55). the IRE1\u2013miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis may also be involved in the pathogenesis of other viral infections, and further study is worthwhile. ST cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and 100 g/ml streptomycin in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.
