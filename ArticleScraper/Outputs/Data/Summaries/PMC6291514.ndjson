{"summary": "pre-partum vaccination with various virulence factors of bacterial or viral infectious diseases is a standard procedure which effectively stimulates the production of specific antibodies (4, 5). a novel production technology using an allogeneic cell line (6) and the addition of a highly potent adjuvant to PregSure BVD induced fatal immune reactions with production of alloreactive antibodies in 5\u201310% of vaccinated cows (7\u20139) we wanted to analyze if there is evidence for differential expression of master transcription factors of cellular immune response in lymphocyte proteome of controls and BNP dams. this altered immune phenotype was also detectable in 22% of cows from a pregSure BVD unvaccinated cohort. this confirmed its natural, not vaccine-induced, appearance in cattle and gave more evidence for immune deviant (ID) phenotype as a genetic predisposition. withdrawal of blood was permitted by the local authority Regierung von Oberbayern, Munich, permit no. 55.2-1-54-2532.3-22-12. blood samples were collected in tubes with heparin sodium 25.000 I.U. cells were washed twice in PBS (4\u00b0C) and either used immediately or stored at 20\u00b0C. cells were pulsed for 14 h with 0,05 mCi/well [methyl-3H]-thymidine. proliferation rate after stimulation was expressed as factor of [3H]-thymidine incorporation with respect to the unstimulated cells. anti-bovine CD8 (mouse IgG2a monoclonal, Bio-Rad AbD Serotec, Puchheim, Germany; 1:50) and FITC-conjugated flow cytometry data was performed using open source Flowing Software 2.5.1. peptides were separated on a reversed chromatography column for 48 h. all unique peptides allocated to a protein were considered for quantification. only proteins quantified with at least two peptides were included for further analysis. arithmetic means of two respective vaccinated control and BNP samples were generated. images were scanned on a transmission scanner and densitometric quantification of Western blot signals was performed using ImageJ software. abundances of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 were normalized to beta actin. venous blood samples were collected in tubes with heparin sodium 25.000 I.U. cells were washed twice in PBS (4\u00b0C) and either used immediately or stored at 20\u00b0C (lysate) for western blot analyses. cells were pulsed for 14 h with 0,05 mCi/well [methyl-3H]-thymidine. proliferation rate after stimulation was expressed as factor of [3H]-thymidine incorporation. anti-bovine CD8 (mouse IgG1 monoclonal, Bio-Rad AbD Serotec, Puchheim, Germany; 1:100), anti-bovine CD8 (mouse IgG2a monoclonal up to 10 most intense ions were selected for fragmentation on the linear ion trap using collision induced dissociation at a target value of 100 ions. spectra were exported as Mascot Generic files and searched against the Ensembl bovine database. proteins with a ratio of at least 2-fold in normalized abundance between control and BNP samples were defined as differentially. Western blots For protein expression analyses with western blots, PBL were first lysed in lysis buffer (9 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 65 mM Dithioerythritol, 4% CHAPS) a transmission scanner and densitometric quantification of Western blot signals was performed using ImageJ software. abundances of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 were normalized to beta actin. cells from pregSure BVD vaccinated cows proliferated significantly stronger (4.5-fold) than cells from vaccinated control dams after PWM stimulation. in vitro proliferation assays revealed a highly significant hyperproliferation of BNP lymphocytes demonstrating an increased reaction to polyclonal immune stimulation in these cows. there were no significant differences in proportional composition of subpopulations between control and BNP dams. no significant differences in proportional composition of subpopulations between control and BNP animals. homogeneous proteomes reveal regulation of differential expression of proteins between normal and deviant immune responders to pregSure BVD vaccination. cows already revealed differences in protein expression patterns in constitutive expression (cE) of proteins, that shifted even stronger after 48 h. controls significantly upregulated STAT1 and STAT6 (D) whereas in PBL of BNP cases STAT3 was enhanced during immune response (D). phosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr701 significantly increased after in vitro stimulation with conA. 1 Tyr701 phosphorylation decreased after ConA stimulation. lymphocytes of BNP dams phosphorylated STAT3 Tyr705 comparatively stronger than PBL of vaccinated control cows. inhibition of STAT3 in PBL of BNP cows Abolishes Hyperproliferation as Reaction to polyclonal Immune Stimulation. t-test used for statistical analyses. in vitro proliferation assays, 22% of unvaccinated cows showed a BNP-like hyperproliferative reaction to ConA (immune deviant (ID) phenotype. immune deviant (ID) phenotype did not show significant differences to lymphocytes of BNP cows in these assays. bovine IFN (D) and IL-4 (E) stimulation showed no significant differences between lymphocytes of unvaccinated and BNP cows. no significant differences between lymphocytes of unvaccinated and BNP cows were determined (ns). no significant differences between lymphocytes of vaccinated and unvaccinated controls and BNP cases after IFN or IL-4 stimulation in vitro. this proves a crucial role for IL-2 in the deviant immune responses, but not for IFN or IL-4. of BNP cows (black) and ID cows (gray) as well as the low proliferation of control cows (white) were consistently detectable over the entire observation period (38 months) three representative control cows and ID cows are shown. two BNP cows suffered twice as often from mastitis than the control cows (white, n = 73) no significant differences in distribution of lymphocyte subsets between control and BNP dams. no significant differences in proportional composition of subpopulations between control and BNP animals. Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocyte subset distribution revealed no significant differences (ns) between control (white bars; n = 4) and BNP cells (black bars; n = 3). in-depth analysis of part of proteome relating to regulation of immune cells revealed some differentially (factor 2.0) expressed STAT proteins in bovine PBL after polyclonal activation with PWM. controls significantly upregulated STAT1 and STAT6 (D), whereas in PBL of BNP cases STAT3 was enhanced during immune response (D) lymphocytes of control and BNP cows regulate different STATs in response to conA stimulation. phosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr701 significantly increased after in vitro stimulation with conA compared to BNP PBL, where STAT1 Tyr701 phosphorylation decreased after ConA stimulation. in control PBL (Ctr, n = 1) and BNP PBL (BNP, n = 1). phosphorylated STAT3 Tyr705 comparatively stronger than vaccinated control lymphocytes (white-black striped bars, n = 5) in response to ConA stimulation. a large group of pregSure BVD unvaccinated cows tested response of lymphocytes to different polyclonal stimuli. we examined response of lymphocytes to different polyclonal stimuli in a large group of pregSure BVD cows. in in vitro proliferation assays, 22% of the unvaccinated cows reacted similar to BNP dams. ID lymphocytes reacted hyperproliferative in comparison to control lymphocytes. lymphocytes of ID cows also reacted excessively (****p 0.0001 vs. Ctr) IL-2, but not IFN or IL-4 promote the Different Immune Response in ID cows. no significant differences between lymphocytes of vaccinated and unvaccinated controls and BNP cases after IFN or IL-4 stimulation in vitro. all cows were clinically healthy and showed no signs of mastitis. this clearly indicates that the hyperproliferative phenotype of ID cows has clinical relevance apart from the response to the BVD vaccine. the hierarchical clustering of identified lymphocyte proteins from our shotgun proteomics experiment substantiated a general quantitative difference in constitutive expression of proteins in PBL of controls and BNP dams. after immune stimulation, these differences increased even further (PWM/ConA, Figures 3A,B) STAT3 induces the development of follicular Th (Tfh), Th17, and Th22 cells (32, 35, 36) in mouse and man, STAT3 induces the development of follicular Th (Tfh), Th17, and Th22 cells (32, 35, 36) otypes of 121 non-PregSure BVD vaccinated cows showed a BNP-like hyperproliferative response to T cell stimulation in vitro. this percentage fits to the findings of Benedictus et al., who hypothesized a heritability of 19% in dams for the development of BNP in the calf (22) this proves the existence of an immune deviant phenotype among a certain subpopulation of cattle. this highly important correlation points to an altered immune reaction of ID cows to classical mastitis pathogens. the ID phenotype shows altered reactions to immune stimulation identical to BNP dams. these features potentially triggered alloantigen-production after maternal PregSure BVD vaccination, causing BNP."}
