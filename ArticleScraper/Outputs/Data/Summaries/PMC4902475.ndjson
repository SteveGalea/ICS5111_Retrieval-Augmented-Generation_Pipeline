{"summary": "influenza is a highly contagious and serious respiratory disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. its annual attack rate is estimated at 5% to 10% in adults and 20% to 30% in children, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness with an annual death toll of 250,000 to 500,000. the government decided to place an additional procurement of southern Hemisphere vaccine that contains the new virus strain. given the limited supply, the additional dose of vaccine was only offered to selected groups. the success of such a programme will depend on many factors, including the attitude and perception of healthcare professionals who are key driver of vaccination. the public, including the healthcare workers, were informed of this plan via the media. the survey was approved by the survey and behavioural research ethics committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. no written consent was required as completion of the survey implied consent. the full version of the survey instrument could be found from appendix I. the respondents could choose \u201cno opinions\u201d in some of the survey items. the study was approved by the survey and behavioural Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. no written consent was required as completion of the survey implied consent. the full version of the survey instrument could be found from appendix I. the respondents could choose \u201cno opinions\u201d in some of the survey items. as of february 2016, the findings of this campaign are still in the analysis stage and will be disseminated very soon. participation Characteristics A total of 1296 completed questionnaires were received, including 992 hard copies and 304 via the on-line platform. the survey covered public hospitals in various geographically dispersed districts, with at least 1 department involved in each hospital. the top priority selected was the elderly aged 65 years with chronic medical conditions (89.2%), followed by the elderly living in residential care homes (87.4%), long-stay residents of institutions for the disabled (80.7%), the elderly aged 65 years (79.3%), and healthcare workers in residential care homes (78.5%) most strongly agreed that doctors (71%), nurses (75.9%), and allied health professionals (54.9%) should be given a top priority for receiving the new vaccine. healthcare workers in primary care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.66, 95% CI 1.07\u20132.58, P = 0.024), doctors (AOR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.94, P = 0.022 for nondoctors), having received influenza vaccination in the past 3 years (AOR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.07\u20130.13, p 0.001 for nonreceivers), higher perceived risk of contracting influenza (AOR = 0.55 the vaccination campaign was started on may 8, 2015, after the current survey was completed. the 1st group of subjects to receive the additional vaccine includes the elderly in long-stay residential care homes. on may 20, 2015, it was extended to the community elderly 85 years or above. 401 respondents expressed their intention to accept the additional ad hoc vaccine. a significantly higher proportion would recommend the new vaccine to their patients (20.3%) and family members (70.3%) who were not at high risk for severe influenza. older age, male sex, working in specialty other than surgery and emergency, engagement in administration or being a medical doctor were significantly associated with intention to accept the vaccine. healthcare workers in primary care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.66, 95% CI 1.07\u20132.58, P = 0.024), doctors (AOR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.07\u20130.13, p 0.001 for nonreceivers), higher perceived risk of contracting influenza (AOR = 86.2% regarded original duty as appropriate during the influenza season. more than half of healthcare workers who perceived themselves as at risk of contracting influenza did not intend to receive the new vaccine. most of the respondents were females, which is compatible with the female dominance in the nursing profession. the response rate to this survey invitation was nevertheless, low. there are a number of reasons which could explain this, including the busy schedule of healthcare professionals, the absence of incentives built in this present survey, and the possibility of multiple study invitations. 80% to 90% of healthcare workers supported vaccination for high-risk patients. this is the first large-scale study which evaluated the acceptability of ad hoc additional influenza vaccination among healthcare workers at a time where antigenic drift occurs. a major limitation of this study included the possibility that their opinions and perception may change overtime. study could inform public health practitioners and policy-makers to design and implement plans for additional influenza vaccination in years where a significant antigenic drift has occurred. factors found to be associated with vaccine nonacceptance and perception of healthcare workers on risk groups which should receive higher priority for vaccination provide useful information for programme planning. more than 1 peak in a year provides an opportunity to administer an additional vaccine with the latest composition to combat newly emerged antigenically drifted variants. the attempt of the government is the first of its kind, and there is currently no study that has explored the level of acceptability of the ad hoc additional influenza vaccination under such circumstances. primary care physicians had a significantly higher acceptance rate than physicians of other specialties. this could play a key role in mobilizing colleagues working in other specialties. 80% to 90% of healthcare workers supported vaccination for high-risk patients. this acceptability survey captured opinions of healthcare workers but not what they would practice in reality. future cohort studies should be performed to assess the actual uptake rate when the vaccine is available for use. there might be more in-depth barriers to receiving the additional vaccine among the healthcare workers."}
