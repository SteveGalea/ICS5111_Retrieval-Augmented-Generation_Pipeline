{"summary": "concurrent infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is known as one of the major causes for porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) it is not known if dual infections with PCV2 and PRRSV in different infection order may lead to different clinical symptoms. swine production has been intensified with larger herd sizes and confinement rearing, contributing to the increased incidence and complexity of the respiratory diseases. a multifactorial complex of swine respiratory pathogens has been reported to play a role or role in PRDC. bacterial pathogens involved in PRDC include mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Salmonella enterica serotype Chloeraesuis. pigs with dual infections of PCV2 and PRRSV consistently have more severe clinical symptoms and interstitial pneumonia [3,4,8-10]. pigs are known as the major target cells for both PCV2 and PRRSV in the lungs [14-17] either PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone could cause significant reduction in the microbicidal capability and induce changes in expression levels of cytokine and chemokine. this may explain partially the pathologic changes observed in PRRSV and PCV2 dually infected cases in the field. pigs were tested negative for PRRSV, PCV1, and PCV2 antibodies. the stock of PRRSV used in the study was the 8th passage of a Taiwan field isolate, PRRSV tw91, at a titer of 107 TCID50/ml. the stock was prepared as previously described at a titer of 5 x 105 cells/ml. three milliliters/flask or 0.5 ml/well of AMs were placed in Teflon flasks (Nalgene Company, Rochester, USA) or 24-well culture plates were immediately exposed to one or both viruses or equal volume of RPMI-C. the m.o.i. for PCV2 and PRRSV was 0.1 each, respectively. AMs or supernatants from all treatment groups were collected and used for assays of antigen-positive rate, survival rate, TUNEL-positive rate, phagocytosis, microbial killing capacity, and cytokine production. survival rate The cytocidal effect of PCV2 and/or PRRSV on AMs was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was determined by counting 200 cells out of 10 randomly selected fields at 400x on a fluorescent microscope (Optiphoto II, Nikon) the phagocytosis and microbial killing assays were carried out as those described previously [15] by using Candida albicans as the target. monolayers of AMs were stained with acridine orange (AO) and counterstained with crystal violet (Sigma) interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- titration The protein levels of IL-8 and TNF- in the supernatants collected at each time point were determined using the commercial ELISA kits. data were expressed as mean concentration at pg/ml. RNA was extracted from AMs using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK), reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by PCR with the following primers. porcine FasL (sense: 5\u2032-AAT GGG AAG ACA CCT ATG GAA-3\u2032, antisense: 5\u2032-CTT AGA GCT TAT ATA AGC CGA AAA ACG TC-3\u2032) agarose gel by electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma) gels were photographed and analyzed using the ChemiDocTM XRS (Bio-Rad, Segrate, Milan, Italy) intensity of Fas or FasL was normalized to that of the GAPDH. moniae, A. pleuropneumoniae, and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae tested negative for PRRSV, PCV1 and PCV2 antibodies and nucleic acids. stock of PRRSV used in the study was the 8th passage of a Taiwan field isolate, PRRSV tw91, at a titer of 107 TCID50/ml. g of amphotericin B/ml in 0.85% saline, (RPMI-C) three milliliters/flask or 0.5 ml/well of AMs were placed in Teflon flasks (Nalgene Company, Rochester, USA) or 24-well culture plates were incubated at 37 in 5% CO2 for various time intervals. the AMs were evaluated for antigen-positive rate, survival rate, TUNEL-positive rate TUNEL-positive rate, phagocytosis, microbial killing capacity, and cytokine production were determined by counting 200 cells out of 10 randomly selected fields. the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was determined by counting 200 cells out of 10 randomly selected fields at 400x magnification on a fluorescent microscope (Optiphoto II, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) positive rate (TR) was recorded as [(number of TUNEL-positive cells/200 Hoechst-positive cells) x 100%] and [(number of AMs containing killed yeasts in randomly selected viable cells/total number of viable cells) x 100%] and [(number of AMs containing killed yeasts in randomly selected viable cells/total number of viable cells]. interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- titration The protein levels of IL-8 and TNF- in the supernatants collected at each time point were determined using the commercial ELISA kits. the plates were read on an ELISA reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Vermont, USA) at 550 nm. sL transcripts by RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from AMs using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK), reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by PCR. porcine FasL (sense: 5\u2032-AAT GGG AAG ACA CCT ATG GAA-3\u2032, antisense: 5\u2032-ACC TCC ACT ACA TGG TCT ACA TGT TC-3\u2032) the intensity of Fas or FasL was normalized to that of the GAPDH. data were expressed as the level different from that of the Mock. no intranuclear PCV2 or PRRSV antigens were observed.

Neither PCV2 nor PRRSV antigens were detected in AMs from the pigs. the SRs of AMs in the PCV2 group were 8.1 6.0% to 11.7 0.7% higher than those of the Mock and PCV2 groups. the SRs of all PRRSV-inoculated groups decreased after PRRSV inoculation. SRs of AMs were 55.6 12.1% to 64.0 14.0% during the experimental period. changes in survival rate and apoptotic rate of swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay and TUNEL assay. the TRs of AMs in the PRRSV and PRRSV/PCV2 groups were 21.8 1.1% to 33.9 0.7% and 25.0 1.0 to 28.6 5.5% respectively. there were no significant differences (P > 0.133) between the two groups during the experimental period. the PRs of AMs from all PRRSV-inoculated groups were consistently and significantly lower (P 0.026) than those of the Mock and PCV2 groups after PRRSV inoculation during 36\u2013108 HPI. the average PRs were similar between the two groups throughout the study. the difference between the two treatment groups at the same h post inoculation (HPI) with the first virus is statistically significant. aValues are significantly different from the Mock at the same h post inoculation (HPI) with the first virus. no statistically significant differences (P > 0.157) in the IL-8 levels in the supernatants of AMs were seen among all PCV2- and/or PRRSV-inoculated groups. the levels of IL-8 (A), TNF- (B) and IFN- (C) produced in PCV2- and/or PRRSV-inoculated swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were expressed as the level different from that of mock-ino all PCV2- and/or PRRSV-inoculated groups showed a consistent and significant increase (P 0.001) in the production of TNF- in the supernatants of AMs. levels of TNF- in the supernatants of AMs in the PCV2 group were 188.8 9.3 to 297.7 5.3 pg/ml and were significantly lower (P 0.028) than those of the Mock group. the levels of IFN- bioactivity in the supernatants of AMs were low throughout the experimental period. they ranged from 0 to 69.5 21.5 U/ml and 75.6 65.5 to 125.0 20.3 U/ml. the levels of IFN- in the supernatants of AMs increased from 1125.0 425.7 to 4815.4 221.5 U/ml in all PCV2-inoculated swine AMs. expression levels of FasL mRNA in AMs from the PCV2-PRRSV group were significantly higher (P 0.016) than those of the PCV2/PRRSV and PRRSV/PCV2 groups. the expression levels of FasL mRNA in all cultures were analyzed at 42 h after inoculation with the first virus. a steady positive rate of intracytoplasmic signals for PCV2 antigens was detected in all groups receiving PCV2. a low but constant intracytoplasmic PRRSV antigen-positive rate, about 5.2 1.0 to 9.9 0.2% and 6.1 0.5 to 9.1 1.3%, was noted in the groups of PRRSV and PRRSV/PCV2 respectively. inoculation with PRRSV alone (PRRSV); solid square: inoculation with PCV2 for 18 h first then PCV2 later (PRRSV/PCV2). survival rate of PCV2- and/or PRRSV-inoculated swine AMs was 97.5 0.7%. SRs of AMs in the PCV2/PRRSV groups were 80.1 4.9% at 18 HPI. they were slightly reduced from 76.3 4.5% to 68.3 5.7% after PRRSV inoculation during 36 to 108 HPI. however, they were significantly lower (P 0.001) than those of the PCV2 group at 36 HPI. aValues are significantly different from the Mock at the same h post inoculation (HPI) with the first virus. the TRs of AMs were very low in both Mock and PCV2 groups. the PRs of AMs in the PCV2 group were consistently and significantly lower (P 0.026) than those of the Mock and PCV2 groups after PRRSV inoculation during 36\u2013108 HPI. the average PRs were similar between the two groups throughout the study but they were significantly higher (P 0.015) than those of the PRRSV group during 90\u2013108 HPI. data are expressed as the level different from that of the mock-inoculated AMs (Mock) and shown as mean SD of three independent experiments. the difference between the two treatment groups at the same h post inoculation (HPI) with the first virus is statistically significant. IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interferon (IFN) levels in the supernatants of PCV2 and/or PRRSV-inoculated swine AMs were significantly higher (P 0.001) than those in the Mock group. no statistically significant differences (P > 0.157) in the IL-8 levels in the supernatants of AMs were seen. PCV2-PRRSV: AMs co-inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously. levels of TNF- in supernatants of AMs in the PCV2 group were 188.8 9.3 to 297.7 5.3 pg/ml. the levels of TNF- in the supernatants of AMs in the PCV2-PRRSV group were significantly lower (P 0.014) than those of the PRRSV/PCV2 group at 18, 54, and 90 HPI. the levels of IFN- bioactivity in the supernatants of AMs in the Mock and PRRSV groups were low throughout the experimental period. ated groups expressed detectable level of FasL mRNA. however, variable FasL mRNA levels were seen in all PCV2 and/or PRRSV-inoculated groups. expression levels of FasL mRNA in AMs from the PCV2-PRRSV group were significantly higher (P 0.016) than those of the PCV2/PRRSV and PRRSV/PCV2 groups. PMs inoculated with PCV2 first then inoculated with PCV2 18 h later. PCV2-PRRSV: AMs co-inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously. a high prevalence of PCV2 and PRRSV co-infection is frequently observed in PRDC-affected pigs. PRRSV replication and PRRSV-induced dysfunction and cytokine production in AMs should have occurred during the first 18 HPI after inoculation of AMs with PRRSV. however, it is reasonable to suggest that as long as PRRSV has established its infection in AMs prior to PCV2 inoculation or infection, the subsequent IFN- production induced by infection with PCV2 later is incapable of curtailing those adverse effects caused by previous or pre-existing PRRSV infection eous inoculation with PRRSV and PCV2 viruses was commonly used in those in vivo studies. results from these field and experimental studies have demonstrated that PRRSV could cause enhanced PCV2 replication evidenced by higher serum and tissue PCV2 loads. this may explain why no significant changes in PCV2 antigen-positive rate were seen in the present study. PRRSV-inoculated groups suggest that PCV2 and/or PRRSV infection may lead to the survival and proliferation of the opportunistic or secondary pathogens and lesion development in pig lungs. the impaired microbicidal capability in PCV2 and/or PRRSV-inoculated groups may be partly due to the reduction in reactive oxygen species production of swine AMs. a significant increase in FasL mRNA expression with no detectable Fas mRNA expression in all PCV2 and/or PRRSV-inoculated AMs suggests that Fas/FasL may not be directly involved in the apoptosis and other cytopathologies. interleukin 8 is an acute inflammatory chemokine for neutrophils. it is also considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia. authors declare that they have no competing interests. china."}
