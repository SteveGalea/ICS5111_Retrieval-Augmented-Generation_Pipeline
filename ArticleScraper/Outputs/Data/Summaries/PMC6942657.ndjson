{"summary": "N. elongata infective endocarditis is rare and no current guidelines exist to direct antibiotic selection and/or duration of treatment. our patient is a healthy young woman, who was found to have an aortic root abscess with valve perforation requiring valve replacement. a 31-year-old woman with no known comorbidities presented to the emergency department for evaluation of intermittent fevers and chills of one-week duration. she described her headache as dull constant pain across her forehead and denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or urinary symptoms. two sets of blood cultures were obtained on admission. the patient was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of a viral illness. she was readmitted for further evaluation. pathology exam showed fragments of aortic valve showing acute inflammatory infiltrate. patient cleared her bacteremia on the third day of appropriate antibiotics. excised valve and swabs from the abscess grew N. elongata within 48 hours. the articles were reviewed to gather information about patients' demographics, preexisting heart diseases, and treatment options. a total of twenty-four reported cases were identified. a total of twenty-four reported cases were identified. several antibiotics were used for many of these patients. preexisting heart disease was present in 15 patients (60%) with mitral valve prolapse, prosthetic aortic valve, and bicuspid aortic valve representing the majority. aortic and mitral valves were the two most common valves affected by Neisseria elongata. a subsp. elongata and N. elongata subsp. glycolytica differ from the other subspecies due to its inability to produce acid from D-glucose. endocarditis caused by non-pathogenic Neisseriae is increasingly reported in recent decades. ciprofloxacin can be a great oral option for treatment of N. elongata endocarditis given its excellent bioavailability. the review of the literature including our case suggests that endocarditis caused by N. elongata requires surgical intervention."}
