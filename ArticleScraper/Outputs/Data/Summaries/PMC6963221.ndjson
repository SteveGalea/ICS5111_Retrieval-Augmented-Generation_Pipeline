{"summary": "disease burden is not evenly distributed across the globe, with Latin America and the Caribbean ending up since 1990 with an increase in dengue-related DALY of about 250% or 4-fold above the global average. disease burden is not evenly distributed across the globe, with Latin America and the Caribbean ending up since 1990 with an increase in dengue-related DALY of about 250% or 4-fold above the global average. clinical Manifestation DENV infection is characterized by a mixed clinical presentation that ranges from an asymptomatic disease to a mild febrile prodrome all the way to a severe hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. all infected individuals, asymptomatic or not, can transmit DENV to Aedes mosquitoes during a blood meal. dengue hemorrhagic fever and severe dengue result from a cytokine-mediated pathology (cytokine storm) that occurs because of the unbalanced production of various soluble and short-lived immune factors. the enveloped virion is constituted of prM/M (precursor membrane/membrane) and E (envelope) structural proteins at the surface while C nucleocapsid protein surrounds the 11 kilobase-long non- ase activity is absolutely required for vRNA 5\u2032 capping and 2\u2032-O-methylation. NS3 is also essential for vRNA synthesis and capping through its helicase, NTPase, and triphosphatase activities. assembled virions bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in this review, we elaborate on the interplay between DENV and innate immunity. a better understanding of how DENV circumvents and attenuates innate immunity can provide critical information for rational vaccine development. 3.9 billion people in endemic or epidemic areas contract the disease each year. about 60 million infected individuals per year will develop symptomatic dengue fever. the disease burden is not evenly distributed across the globe. Latin America and the Caribbean ending up since 1990 with an increase in dengue-related DALY of about 250% or 4-fold above the global average. dengue hemorrhagic fever includes abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, ascites, pleural effusion, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness. severe dengue (or dengue shock) occurs when the infection leads to severe plasma leakage, massive bleeding, and multiple organ failures. the enveloped virion is constituted of prM/M (precursor membrane/membrane) and E (envelope) structural proteins at the surface while C nucleocapsid protein surrounds the 11 kilobase-long non-segmented viral RNA genome (vRNA) NS proteins are responsible for vRNA replication that occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. DENV induces the biogenesis of specific membranous replication organelles. RFs are formed by altering the curvature and composition of cellular endomembranes. they are formed by altering the curvature and composition of cellular endomembranes. innate immunity is the first line of defence against viral pathogens. recognition of DENV is done by specialized proteins called Pattern Recognition Receptors. this detection signal is transduced by adaptor proteins to activate various transcription factors that drive the production of antiviral proteins including type I and type III interferons (IFN) innate antiviral immunity is a crucial cellular system that provides a quick response force against a given pathogen infection. deNV-derived PAMPs are recognized by various pathogen recognition receptors like RIG-I. deNV vRNA-Recognition The RIG-I-Like Receptor pathway has been classically studied for its role in the detection of viral ribonucleic acids. they are ubiquitously expressed and can sense specific viral RNA moieties such as short uncapped 5\u2032 triphosphorylated single-stranded (ss) RNA, short double-stranded (ds) RNA, or long dsRNA. this triggers MAVS oligomerization the activity of the MAVS regulome is tightly regulated by the morphodynamics of mitochondria as well as their contacts with the ER. to sum up, mitochondria outer membrane is the scaffold of RLR signalling and plays an essential role in the initiation, propagation, and the amplification of innate immunity against RNA viruses. a study in rhesus macaques showed that the combined agonist-mediated stimulation of both TLR3 and TLR7/8 following DENV infection resulted in a decrease in viral replication and enhanced pro-inflammatory responses. this highlights the antiviral potential of the TLR3 pathway against DENV in vivo. foreign DNA-sensing pathway relies on various intracellular DNA sensors. cGAS produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) Upon binding, cGAS produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) cGAS/STING pathway has been at the centre of many research interests. the emerging concept of a cross talk between the RIG-I/MAVS and cGAS/STING pathways is surely interesting to understand DENV biology. cGAS mice had a higher viral load and lower ISG expression, resulting in a higher mortality when compared to wild-type controls. deNV vRNA-Recognition The RIG-I-Like Receptor pathway has been classically studied for its role in the detection of viral ribonucleic acids. they are ubiquitously expressed and are able to sense specific viral RNA moieties such as short uncapped 5\u2032 triphosphorylated single-stranded (ss) RNA, short double-stranded (ds) RNA, or long dsRNA. this triggers MAVS oli a study using RIG-I dominant-negative mutants showed that RIG-I is required to trigger IRF-3-dependent antiviral immunity against DENV in A549 lung cancer cells. this observation was recapitulated in various cell types (Huh7 hepatocarcinoma cells, endothelial cells, and primary monocytes) toll-like receptors (TLR) are located at the plasma membrane or within late endosomes. they can sense a variety of PAMPs such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, dsDNA, ssRNA, and dsRNA. for DENV infection, TLR3 can recognize vRNA and its stimulation dampens DENV replication in cellulo. cGAS produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) Upon binding, cGAS produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which in turn activates Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) the engagement of the cGAS pathway leads to the stimulation of TBK1 and ultimately to the production of type I IFN. several viruses have developed targeted evasion mechanisms to interfere with this pathway. the emerging concept of a cross talk between the RIG-I/MAVS and cGAS/STING pathways is surely interesting to understand DENV biology. there is an accumulating literature that shows that the RLR pathway is able to potentiate the cGAS/STING pathway and vice versa during RNA virus infection. neo-synthesized uncapped DENV RNAs \u201chide\u201d from RIG-I in VPs. the replicated DENV RNA molecule possesses several intrinsic features that allow its evasion from detection by the innate immune system. this mechanism is not necessarily strictly dependent on the capping of the vRNA. the replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant is attenuated at the early stages of the life cycle, i.e. during the first 16 h of infection. this resulted in an increase in ISG transcription at the early time points postinfection with an enrichment in PRR genes (RIG-I, MDA5 and IFIT1). a 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV2 strain was identified as a vaccine candidate. DENV sfRNAs are able to inhibit TRIM25 deubiquitylation by USP15. this prevents the K63 polyubiquitylation of RIG-I, its dimerization via its CARD domains. this prevents the K63 polyubiquitylation of RIG-I, its dimerization via its CARD domains. mitochondria show an elongated morphology in DENV-infected cells and make contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum. mitochondrial morphodynamics were reported to modulate antiviral signalling. mitochondrial morphodynamics were reported to modulate antiviral signalling. mitochondrial morphodynamics is not unique to DENV since related strategies have been observed for other viruses such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. DENV impairs the morphology of another membranous organelle functionally linked to MAVS-related signalling. ER and mitochondria, DENV induce a loss of cellular peroxisomes [102,103], which contain MAVS at their surface and constitute a transduction platform for innate signalling [104,105,106]. CMs constitute a \u201chijacking\u201d unit, which targets the whole MAVS signalosome at multiple levels. the close spatial relationship between CMs and mitochondria would help to \u201ctrap\u201d host targets inside CMs or to concentrate them near viral proteins in order to very efficiently downregulate the MAVS signalosome. this model requires experimental challenging. interference with the IFN signalling In addition to the primary virus sensing pathway, DENV is also able to target several components of the downstream interferon-induced JAK-STAT signalling cascade. early in vitro assays demonstrated that DENV NS4B is able to prevent STAT1 activation by a mechanism conserved in WNV and YFV that is yet to be clarified. DENV and ZIKV NS5 selectively inhibit ISG expression by binding to and antagonizing the transcription factor PAF1C. sfRNA binding to these host factors protects DENV replication from IFN- treatment. sfRNA binding to these host factors protects DENV replication from IFN- treatment. IFIT1 senses virus infection through the binding to foreign RNAs lacking 2\u2032-O-methyls and inhibits the translation of viral RNA via the displacement of eIF4E. the pathogenesis of the E218A MTase mutant is greatly attenuated in wt mice. viral double-stranded RNA is processed into small siRNAs by RNase III DICER and is processed into viral siRNAs (vsiRNAs) by AGO2. sfRNA plays two distinct roles in the evasion of the innate immune response in mammalian hosts or arthropod vectors. this concept of different roles of host factors between the mammalian hosts or arthropod vectors will most likely be explored in the future. DENV NS5 has a methyltransferase (MTase) activity that generates the 5\u2032 7-methyl-guanosine cap and also methylates the 2\u2032-OH position on the first nucleotide. the 2\u2032-O-methylated vRNAs mimic cellular mRNAs, thus evading the host immune system. the 2\u2032-O-methylation has been shown to be important to avoid coronavirus infection recognition by M sfRNAs are produced as byproducts of incomplete degradation of flaviviral RNA due to unique secondary structures in the 3\u2032 UTR that causes XRN1 to stall and cut the vRNA prematurely. sfRNAs are produced as byproducts of an incomplete degradation of flaviviral RNA due to unique secondary structures in the 3\u2032 UTR. DENV NS3 is able to prevent RIG-I translocation to the mitochondria by sequestering 14-3-3 [89]. viruses expressing a mutated NS3 unable to associate with 14-3-3 elicited a stronger immune response and replicated less efficiently in immune-competent cells. mitochondria elongation was attributed to NS4B since its overexpression alone recapitulated the phenotype. inhibition of the phosphorylation-dependent activation of DRP1 was observed in both infected and NS4B-expressing cells, thus favouring mitochondrial elongation over fission. this is consistent with the different assumed functions of MFN1 in docking and fusion of the mitochondria and of MFN2 in the stabilization of the interactions between mitochondria [95,96]. this suggests that DENV might alter ERMCs by directly targeting MFN2 through NS2B3 protease activity without necessarily impacting on mitochondria fusion and elongation. downstream of MAVS, DENV is also able to evade RLR signalling. NS2A, NS2B3 and NS4B are able to block IRF3 phosphorylation by interfering with serine kinase activity of TBK1 and IKBKE. all these evasion strategies are consistent with the idea that DENV physically targets the MAVS signalosome. interference with the cGAS/STING Pathway DENV also has the capacity to directly interfere with IFN induction that is triggered by the activated cGAS/STING pathway. DENV NS2B marks cGAS for lysosomal degradation and DENV NS2B-NS3 protease cleaves STING to suppress type I IFN induction. STAT1 inhibition most likely occurs either through prevention of its activation or by its dephosphorylation or by degradation of activated STAT1. this STAT2-related evasion strategy is also conserved in other flaviviruses, such as ZIKV. replication of the NS5 E217A 2\u2032-O-MTase DENV2 mutant is significantly more sensitive to IFN- treatment than wt virus. the 2\u2032-O-methylation mechanism described above is a way to downregulate PRR early IFN response. it1 knockout C57BL/6 mice with the mutant WNV restored lethality. sfRNA targets innate immune signalling in human cells at multiple levels. sfRNA plays two distinct roles in the evasion of the innate immune response in mammalian hosts. CYD-TDV is a tetravalent dengue chimeric live-attenuated vaccine based on the YFV 17D strain as a backbone. the vaccine confers less protection against serotypes 1 and 2 than with serotypes 3 and 4. a global vaccination campaign in schools of the Philippines has resulted in the death of many children. the development of new dengue vaccines faces many challenges, including some involving the interplay between the virus and the immune system. a majority of deNV infections go unnoticed, some infected individuals progress along the disease spectrum and develop dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock. CYD-TDV is a safe and efficacious tool in the therapeutic arsenal against DENV when properly administered. but it is plagued by shortcomings and controversies and does not completely meet the need for an effective dengue vaccine. innate immunity research can inform vaccine design. 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase-Deficient Dengue Vaccine. mutants are impaired in 2\u2032-O-methylation but are still able to perform the N7-methylation of the cap. this is consistent with the idea that they are impaired in IFIT inhibition. a single dose of this live attenuated vaccine was enough for a complete seroconversion and protection. immunocompetent mouse model for denv Vaccine research rely on large animal models during nonclinical and preclinical studies. the use of small animal models such as mice usually requires genetic modifications that dampen their immune system in order to increase viral permissiveness. in most cases, in vivo DENV studies involve immunodeficient mouse strains such as AG129 which do not express IFN-/ and IFN- receptors. despite attenuation, the DENV30 is highly immunogenic in both humans and rhesus monkeys for all tested serotypes. it confers protection upon homologous rechallenge, limiting the risk of transmission from a vaccinated human to the Aedes vector. however, it was shown that DENV430-infected cells accumulated less sfRNA, resulting in an increased sensitivity to type I IFN production and response. treatment of mice competent for T-cell responses with these viruses alone or in serotype combination conferred protection against a subsequent infection with a lethal mouse-adapted DENV strain. a single dose of this live attenuated vaccine was sufficient to elicit a strong humoral response that conferred survival following heterologous rechallenge in BALB/c mice. researchers have developed an immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of ZIVK infection by replacing the mouse STAT2 by the human STAT2 [169]. this genetic engineering was conceptually made possible thanks to previous studies which showed that ZIKV induces the degradation of human STAT2 but not of the mouse ortholog [123,124,170]."}
