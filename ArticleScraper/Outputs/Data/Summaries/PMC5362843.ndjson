{"summary": "an 8 year-old cat presented with a diminished appetite, dysphagia, weight loss, lethargy and coughing. an 8 year-old cat presented with a diminished appetite, dysphagia, weight loss, weight loss, lethargy and coughing. primary lung tumours are rare in cats and represent a sporadic geriatric disease with a mean age of onset of 12 years. in cats, the most commonly recognised primary lung tumours are adenocarcinomas. a lung mass sample obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate biopsy was not conclusive, showing only a few cells exhibiting epithelial morphology. a bone marrow aspirate from the right wing of the ilium was obtained, under sedation, using a Mallarm\u00e9 trocar. tubular and tubular\u2013alveolar structures are lined by a thick wall of cuboidal cells, with a clear cytoplasm and a hyperchromatic nucleus. the neoplastic cells have a high N/C ratio, fine chromatin, nucleoli and a stripped cytoplasm with a foamy vacuolated background. bone marrow micrometastases from canine and feline carcinomas have been demonstrated in one prospective study. in 30 dogs and four cats with various types of carcinoma, bone marrow micrometastases were found in two dogs with advanced disease. in human patients, bone is among the most common sites of cancer metastases. many tumour cells produce large amounts of IL-6 and express its receptor. IL-6 stimulates tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion of distant organs. in human medicine, several studies have shown that DTCs originate from primary tumours, including primary lung carcinomas. al cancer in human patients is currently performed by bone marrow evaluation using routine cytology, immunocytochemistry with anti-cytokeratin antibodies and molecular techniques involving reverse transcriptase PCR. cell-block cytology has also been described,9 and this approach allows analysis using immunocytochemistry. the second aim of this clinical case is to report monoclonal gammopathy associated with bronchial carcinoma in a cat. retrospective study of 155 cats reported the presence of a narrow monoclonal peak for globulins associated with pulmonary carcinoma in one cat. a narrow band is occasionally detected on SPE in association with malignant neoplasms of epithelial cell origin. high serum globulin values are statistically correlated with better median survival in small cell lung cancer. the presence of a narrow spike in the region on SPE is suggestive of monoclonal immunoglobulin production. IL-6 plays a key role in B-cell differentiation and acts upon activated and proliferating B cells."}
