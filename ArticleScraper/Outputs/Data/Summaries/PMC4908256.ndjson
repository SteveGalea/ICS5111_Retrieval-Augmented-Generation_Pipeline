{"summary": "several pathological diseases are linked with aberrant DNA replication through several DNA mutations and chromosome rearrangements. faithful transfer of genetic information during replication can be impaired by several environmental and cellular factors. iquitin, a highly conserved, 76-aminoacid protein, is commonly used by cells for proteasome-mediated protein degradation. but its proteasome-independent functions help in the regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. this can be reversed by a family of enzymes known as the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in this paper, we will highlight the role of ubiquitination in major repair pathways. the repair mechanism after DSBs is mediated by polyubiquitination, the repair of DNA adducts by nucleotide excision repair pathway, and the Fanconi anemia pathway. translesion polymerases, also known as translesion polymerases, have flexible base-pairing properties. they are responsible for introducing several point mutations in the genome, leading to permanent damage and onset of carcinogenesis. in yeast, a second pathway exists that ensures error-free bypass of DNA damage or lesions. small adducts can be identified and removed by base excision repair (BER) pathway. bulky ones are removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. BER pathway is highly conserved among species. checkpoint activation ensures arresting or slowing down of cell cycle. ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1 kinase-pathways play key roles in signaling checkpoint arrest. cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are prime targets of the checkpoint pathways. ligase APC/C helps in the formation of polyubiquitin chains on substrates for subsequent degradation. APCCDH1 takes part in a p53-independent checkpoint response that targets degradation of cyclin D1. phosphatase CDC14B is translocated from the nucleus to the nucleoplasm, resulting in dephosphorylation of CDH1 thereafter activates the APC/C. monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein takes place at Lysine 561. it is conserved among eukaryotes, suggesting evolutionary significance of this particular gene. mutation in Lysine 561 affecting the monoubiquitination of this protein fails to complement the DNA crosslinking activity. the conserved RING domain in BRCA1 forms a heterodimer with the RING domain of another protein BARD1. however, the heterodimer does not seem to influence FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vivo. Deficiency of USP1 or FANCD2 promotes haematopoietic stem cells defects [50], and siRNA knockdown experiments have shown that USP1 also deubiquitinates FANCI [48] but whether this step is indispensable for ICL repair needs to be ascertained. FANCD2 is the catalytic subunit of the core complex and interacts with the E2 conjugating enzyme (UBE2T) to ubiquitinate FANCD2 and FANCI, which are then recruited to the damaged chromatin. monoubiquitination of the protein takes place at Lysine 561 and is conserved among eukaryotes, suggesting the evolutionary significance of this particular gene. FANCI (mutated in FA-I patients) also undergoes monoubiquitination. this modification is critical for repair of DNA crosslink damage. the current understanding is that, in the absence of DNA damage, FANCD2 and FANCI are present as free entities. FANCL binds FANCD2 and FANCI, monoubiquitinates them, and finally recruits them to chromatin. Deficiency of USP1 or FANCD2 promotes haematopoietic stem cells defects. polyubiquitination of PCNA promotes an alternative error-free pathway of bypassing the damage. mediated by the combined action of Rad6, Rad18, and Rad5 ubiquitin ligases, promotes an error-free pathway. the ring finger protein RNF8, in conjugation with its E2 enzyme, ubiquitinylates H2AX and H2A. this leads to the recruitment of proper effector complexes at the sites where the repair foci are formed. however, it is still unclear if polyubiquitination of H2AX and H2A is essential for recruitment of BRCA1 or RAP 80. NER pathway phosphorylates kinase ATM and recruits it to the site of DNA damage. helix-distorting damages include the UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. derma pigmentosum (XP) was classified in 7 subgroups XP-A to XP-G. a UV-damaged DNA-binding component DDB is responsible for the inability of these cells to bind damaged DNA. patients are also hypersensitive to sunlight and show signs of premature ageing. recruitment of BRCA1 to the site of damage is mediated by a series of ubiquitination events. recruitment of BRCA1 to the site of damage is mediated by a series of ubiquitination events that are initiated by RING finger protein 8 (RNF8) in complex with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (Ubc13) depletion of RNF8 leads to a failure in assembling the components at the sites of damage. also, cells lacking the RNF8-E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, Ubc13, fail to establish a proper DNA damage response. once the repair process is completed, deubiquitinating enzymes remove or edit polyubiquitin chains. helix-distorting damages include the UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PP) defective NER activity gives rise to some rare autosomal-recessive disorders in humans such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process that depends on DUBs. the human genome encodes about 100 DUBs involved in processing of ubiquitin precursors and removal of ubiquitin or polyubiquitin from the target proteins. the first four families are papain-like cysteine proteases that include the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the ova there are seven DUBs involved in opposing the function of E3 ubiquitin ligases. ubiquitin-binding domains and protein-protein interaction domains help in DUB function. ubiquitination is regulated by the DUB USP1 [6, 10]. inhibitors to any ubiquitinated proteins that help in genome maintenance and repair are predicted to be potent antiproliferative agents. discovery of such agents will open up new avenues for the treatment of cancer. studies have shown that COP1 is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma. recent reports have described small molecules that target the cullin-regulated E3 ligases. a specific inhibitor, MLN4924, of NEDD8 activating enzyme E1, had been developed. this small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-E1 is presently being evaluated in several clinical trials. the targets of ubiquitination in the DSB pathway are still not clear. several details of the FA pathway and the DNA damage bypass pathways are still being worked out."}
