{"summary": "a 14 month-old boy was admitted to the paediatric unit with vomiting, listlessness and abnormal eye movements. he developed a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the face, trunk and limbs. his medical history was essentially unremarkable and was up to date on his vaccination schedule. alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) level of 53 U/L. immunological workup revealed positive IgM for EBV viral capsid antigen. cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM was also positive. sagittal MRI in T2 and postcontrast T1 WI showed diffuse patchy intramedullary areas of increased signal intensity along the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. a brain biopsy was not performed. the patient was scheduled for an outpatient follow-up appointment 2 weeks after his hospital discharge. a repeat brain and spine MRI was suggested to the family as it would help rule out MS and establish ADEM as the most likely diagnosis. a repeat MRI was suggested to the family as it would help rule out MS. at least 70% of patients report an antecedent prodromal event 2\u201330 days prior to the onset of ADEM symptoms. non-specific respiratory viral infections have become the major prodromal illness in developed countries. a 14 month-old boy developed ADEM 10 days after having a prodromal illness that is clinically compatible with IM. the phenomenon most consistent with EBV infection was the development of a diffuse maculopapular rash a few days after the administration of Augmentin. a monospot test is normally sensitive and specific for EBV mononucleosis. many attempts have been made to explain the pathogenesis of EBV-related encephalitis and autoimmune demyelinating diseases, such as ADEM. many attempts have been made to explain the pathogenesis of EBV-related encephalitis and autoimmune demyelinating diseases. primary CMV infection will only cause up to 7% of cases of mononucleosis. lymphocytosis with a positive EBV IgM is sufficient to establish EBV as the culprit over CMV. an EBV mononucleosis syndrome followed by ADEM would be the most likely explanation. most paediatric groups described the use of high-dose steroids. methylprednisolone (10\u201330 mg/kg/day up to a maximum dose of 1 g/day) and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) for 3\u20135 days. full recovery was reported in 50\u201380% of patients. the diagnosis of ADEM requires a first clinical event of both polysymptomatic encephalopathy and focal or multifocal involvement predominantly affecting the CNS white matter. at least 70% of patients report an antecedent prodromal event 2\u201330 days prior to the onset of ADEM symptoms. measles was identified as a major cause of ADEM in the past. non-specific respiratory viral infections have become the major prodromal illness in developed countries. the infection typically occurs days to weeks prior to the disease. studies have found the relative risk of developing this characteristic rash to be as high as 58 times in EBV-positive patients as opposed to those without EBV. a monospot test, which is normally sensitive and specific for EBV mononucleosis, is of limited value in children 4 years17. cross-reactivity between EBV and myelin proteins has been proposed as a potential mechanism by which the autoimmune response is triggered. if and when the virus directly infects the surrounding myelin-supporting cells, it inserts specific polypeptides into host cell membranes. if and when the virus directly infects the surrounding myelin-supporting cells, it inserts specific polypeptides into host cell membranes, which in turn initiates an autoimmune response a brain and spine MRI supported the diagnosis of ADEM by showing characteristic diffuse demyelinating disease (figures 1 and 2). MRI is the preferred modality for imaging the brain in patients with ADEM since early CT imaging is often normal. the lesions normally do not show enhancement in the contrast-enhanced images, and typically do not show restricted diffusion. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a monophasic, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. the occurrence of ADEM following a symptomatic EBV infection in this age group is a rare case in paediatric neurology."}
