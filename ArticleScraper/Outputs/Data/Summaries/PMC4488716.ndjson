{"summary": "viroporins are a family of hydrophobic viral proteins that oligomerize to form aqueous channels on host cellular membrane and modify its permeability. some viroporins have been shown to play critical functions in the entry, genome replication, assembly and release during virus infection. a number of viroporins have been shown to localize to the ER and/or its associated membrane networks. the presence of these channel proteins might disrupt the membrane potential and affect normal physiology of the ER. the presence of these channel proteins might disrupt the membrane potential. in this review, we will briefly highlight the signaling pathways related to ER stress response and autophagy. a few well-characterized examples from recent published studies will then be reviewed. several small membrane-associated viral proteins without confirmed ion channel activities will also be discussed. IRE1 also contributes to ER stress-induced apoptosis via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase 12. signaling via activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway also promotes apoptosis induction during prolonged ER stress. ER protein chaperones, such as glucose regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) and ER-resident enzymes, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) have all been shown to be induced by ATF6. cleavage releases the cytosolic domain, which translocates to the nucleus and activates genes harboring an ER stress response element (ERSE) autophagy pathway can be divided into four steps: initiation, isolated membrane nucleation, elongation and lysosomal fusion. each step is tightly regulated by numerous highly conserved autophagy-related genes (ATGs) the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is inactivated, leading to the formation of the ULK complex and its translocation from cytosol to certain domains of the ER where autophagy is initiated. the ULK complex then recruits the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) complex, which includes vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vsp34), Vps15 and coiled- vesicle fusion is called autolysosome and the sequestered cargos are degraded by lysosomal enzymes to recycle biomolecules to the cytoplasm. several properties of the viroporins suggest that they might also modulate the virus-induced ER stress response. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) E and 3a protein, rotavirus NSP4 and influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein, has been investigated. sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) actively transfers cytosolic calcium ion into the ER lumen, thus establishing a relatively high [Ca2+] in the lumen. the high [Ca2+ viral-induced autophagy may be mediated by the activation of calcium-dependent kinases such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase kinase kinase- (CaMKK-), as described below for rotavirus NSP4. membrane structures co-localize with non-structural proteins and are proposed to play important roles in the replication/transcription of the viral genomes. early studies have shown that trafficking of a model glycoprotein is inhibited in cells infected with poliovirus or transfected with the P2B viroporin. similar result has been obtained for coxsackievirus, where VSV-G is arrested in the Golgi complex when co-expressed with the P2B protein. a similar delayed Golgi transport has been observed in cells treated with monensin. the low cytosolic [Ca2+] in the ER enables a sudden release of calcium to serve as a secondary messenger of various signaling pathways. the high [Ca2+] in the ER is essential for the function of numerous calcium dependent protein chaperones and enzymes, such as calnexin, calreticulin, GRP78 and PDI. the formation of viroplasm, an ER-originated multivesicular body, has been attributed to the activity of the viroporin P2B, P2C and P2BC [49], but the involvement of other viroporins in membrane remodeling has not been fully investigated. the formation of viral-induced DMVs actually utilize mechanisms distinct from autophagy [51,52] a similar result has been obtained for coxsackievirus. it has also been shown that the influenza virus HA protein accumulates in the Golgi when co-expressed with the P2B protein. a similar delayed Golgi transport has been observed in cells treated with monensin, an ionophore that equilibrates the Golgi pH and prevents its acidification. the E protein is partially N-linked glycosylated at Asn 66 [60]. the protein is located in the golgi or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) in the infected cells and also in cells transfected with the E gene cDNA [61,62,63,64,65] the membrane topology in some cases is still under debate. deletion of the gene results in the formation of non-infectious immature virions. coronavirus E protein has also been shown to serve multiple functions. ion channel activity of coronavirus E protein has been characterized in planar lipid bilayers. early studies have shown that overexpression of MHV and SARS-CoV E protein induces apoptosis in cultured cells. the pro-apoptotic function of SARS-CoV E protein could be mediated by a reported interaction with the cellular anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) higher level of apoptosis is also detected in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-E compared with wild type-infected cells. this suggests an anti-apoptotic function of the IRE1 pathway in rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells. it is also possible that the anti-apoptotic function of SARS-CoV E protein is mediated by other uncharacterized mechanisms independent of IRE1. the 3a protein is an accessory protein of SARS-CoV with no known homolog in other coronaviruses. the protein is translated from a dicistronic subgenomic mRNA. a mixed population of transcripts with six, seven, eight and nine uridine stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon for 3a ORF have been found. the same study has also shown that knockdown of 3a significantly inhibits the release of SARS-CoV, while genome replication is not affected. overexpression of 3a has been shown to activate luciferase reporters harboring the promoter sequences of GRP78, GRP94, ATF4 and CHOP. reverse genetics have used reverse genetics to generate a recombinant SARS-CoV with the ORF 3a deleted (3a) compared with wild type SARS-CoV, vero cells infected the 3a mutant experience less membrane rearrangement and Golgi fragmentation, with a reduced amount of vesicle formation. the ability of 3a to modify cellular membrane network may partially explain how it triggers ER stress. a cleavage product of NSP4 has been found to be secreted by rotavirus-infected cells. full-length NSP4 is secreted in a soluble lipoprotein form, which binds to glycosaminoglycans on the surface of different cell types. cellular autophagy is required for efficient rotavirus replication. rotavirus NSP4 uses its viroporin activity to release calcium from ER to the cytosol, thereby activating CaMKK- to induce autophagy. the virus hijacks the autophagy pathway to deliver ER-associated viral proteins to the viroplasm. however, the detailed mechanisms of how viral proteins are specifically loaded to the NSP4/LC3-positive vesicles remain to be investigated. apoptosis induction is found higher in autophagy-deficient cells infected with IAV. this suggests that M2 may contribute to cell death by blocking the maturation step of the pro-survival autophagy pathway. a recent study by beale and Wise further characterizes the molecular mechanism by which the IAV M2 protein modulates autophagy. a number of small viral membrane-associated viral proteins have also been demonstrated to induce ER stress and/or autophagy. these proteins may potentially harbor ion channel activities, but function by interacting with known viroporins or by some distinct, unrelated mechanisms. research on these small viral membrane proteins could provide insights on the functional study of viroporins, so they are also briefly reviewed here. the flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins modulate ER stress response and autophagy in the infected cells. the non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) of coronavirus is a multi-pass transmembrane protein localized in the ER [126]. a recently identified inhibitor targeting NSP6 has been shown to inhibit DMVs formation in a broad range of coronaviruses. coronavirus envelope (E) protein is very small in size (8\u201310 kDa) most coronavirus E protein is non-glycosylated, with the exception for SARS-CoV E protein, which is partially N-linked glycosylated at Asn 66 [60] onavirus E proteins have been shown to be palmitoylated [62,69]. this post-translational modification has been shown to be crucial for the assembly of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis Virus (MHV). co-expression of the M and E protein is necessary and sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles in cells [73,72] biophysical studies have demonstrated that the E protein forms an ion channel that is partially inhibited by the compound hexamethylene amiloride (HMA). recent studies have elucidated the structure of the pentameric -helical bundle of SARS-CoV E protein ion channel [84,85], which shows voltage independent ion conductance that is also regulated by lipid charges. significant splicing of XBP1 mRNA can be observed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-E but not in cells infected with wild type virus. overexpression of SARS-CoV E protein is also found to down-regulate the induction of stress genes in cells treated with ER stresssors or infected with respiratory syncytial virus. recombinant SARS-CoVs incorporate mutations in the E gene that disrupt its ion conductivity. knockdown of E protein ion channel activity significantly reduces the fitness of SARS-CoV in competition assays. it is also intriguing to determine whether the modulation of host stress response and the anti-apoptotic function previously characterized for SARS-CoV are indeed mediated via its viroporin activity. stretches have been shown to serve as sole signals for +1 and 1 ribosomal frameshifting. a number of studies have pointed to a punctate cytoplasmic localization of the 3a protein. the protein contains a short extracellular N-terminus, three transmembrane domains, followed by a long cytosolic C-terminus. the ability to modulate the PERK branch of UPR could at least partially explain why overexpression of the PERK-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP pathway induces apoptosis induction during IBV infection. the mechanism behind 3a-induced ER stress has not been investigated in detail. the N-terminus of NSP4 anchors the protein to the ER, whereas the C-terminal tail points to the cytoplasm. the highly conserved coiled-coil domain has been shown to form a tetramer or pentamer in a pH-dependent manner. a domain spanning amino acids 47\u201390 has been shown to insert into membranes. rotavirus-induced autophagy is not complete in rotavirus-infected cells. experiments using the lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 and the tandem-fluorescent LC3 reporter suggest that rotavirus-induced autophagy does not proceed to the lysosomal fusion stage. apoptosis induction is found higher in autophagy-deficient cells. apoptosis induction is found higher in autophagy-deficient cells. apoptosis induction is found higher in autophagy-deficient cells. sequence analysis has identified a highly conserved FVSI or FVNI motif in the cytoplasmic tail of M2. this FVxI motif matches the consensus LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif presents in other LC3-binding proteins. the LIR of M2 is also shown to facilitate virion budding for the filamentous strain of IAV. membrane-remodeling events are driven by two hydrophobic transmembrane non-structural proteins, NS4A and NS4B. NS4A has been shown to activate the IRE1 and ATF6 branches of UPR. overexpression of NS4A of DENV2 has also been shown to induce PI3K-dependent autophagy. a recently identified inhibitor targeting NSP6 has been shown to induce the formation of DMVs that are similar to those observed in the infected cells [128]. the ability to induce autophagy is shared by NSP6 of different coronaviruses and NSP5-7 of one arterivirus of the same order Nidovirales. the mechanism behind NSP6-induced autophagy is not known. phenotypes observed in cells overexpressing specific viroporins may not reflect their physiological functions in the setting of an actual infection. a certain function of a viroporin could be mediated independent of its ion channel activity. a certain function of a viroporin could be mediated independent of its ion channel activity. viroporins in pathogenesis and host-virus interactions facilitate the development of safer and more effective antivirals and vaccines."}
