{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Conventional translation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) full-length messenger RNA produces Gag, the precursor of its structural proteins. it also produces Gag-Pol, the precursor of its enzymes, via a programmed 1 ribosomal frameshift. current models propose that the encounter between ribosomes and the FSS forces them to make a pause. control dual-luciferase mRNA reporter has a short (90 nt long) and unstructured 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) this contrasts with the 300-nt-long 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA, which is highly structured. the translation of this mRNA can be initiated in a cap-dependent and also in an IRES-dependent way. this mRNA is capped and polyadenylated. it is shown under the Weeks conformation, as adapted from Wilkinson et al. (2008). TAR can activate or inhibit the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase PKR. PKR causes translation inhibition by phosphorylation of the -subunit of eIF2. inhibition of PKR by decreasing the amount of phosphorylated eIF2 has opposite effect. Tat can counteract the effect of TAR and stimulate translation of viral mRNAs. but other studies contradict these observations. Tat up-regulates several cellular RNA helicases. phosphorylation by PKR or by inhibiting PKR activity, independently of the presence of TAR. in the absence and in the presence of Tat, the effect of the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA on the efficiency of the programmed 1 frameshift occurring upon translation. pDual-HIV* mRNA reporter contains a short and relatively unstructured 5\u2032 UTR. the mRNA reporter contains a short and relatively unstructured 5\u2032 UTR. pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV and p5\u2032UTR-HIV could use both the cap-dependent and the IRES-dependent initiation mode. CAT coding sequence is translated via a cap-dependent initiation mode. Rluc and Fluc are produced via an IRES-dependent initiation mode. all of the reporters used in this study are derivatives of this dual-luciferase reporter, which differ in their 5\u2032 UTR. pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV was designed so that translation of the CAT sequence results from a cap-dependent initiation. the production of the luciferases, preceded by the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA, results from an IRES-dependent initiation. only the cap-dependent initiation is available in pDual-HIV* and pTP-HIV. the remaining structured region of the 5\u2032 UTR causes about a twofold increase in frameshift efficiency when compared with pDual-HIV. mutations in the IRES known to increase or decrease by twofold the IRES activity did not affect frameshift efficiency when introduced in p5\u2032UTR-HIV. in pDual-HIV* and the variations of frameshift efficiency with pTP-HIV, p5\u2032UTR-HIV, and pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV, when compared with pDual-HIV*, reproduced the changes observed when comparing the Fluc/Rluc ratios in the 1 constructs. the fluc/Rluc ratio represents the relative frameshift efficiency corresponding to the different 5\u2032 UTRs inserted upstream of the dual- the TAR-Poly(A) region, as seen with pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV, reduces translation efficiency about fourfold when compared with pDual-HIV*. with these constructs, a high frameshift efficiency parallels a low translation efficiency. with these constructs, a high frameshift efficiency parallels a low translation efficiency. changes in frameshift efficiency in HEK 293T cells were assessed by measuring the changes in the Fluc/Rluc ratios in the 1 constructs. the frameshift efficiency was found to be 11.0% 1.0% in pDual-HIV* and increased 1.5-fold in pTP-HIV or p5\u2032UTR-HIV. TAR-Poly(A) reduces translation efficiency by 2.5-fold compared with pDual-HIV*. a structured region lacking TAR-Poly(A) has a translation rate comparable to pDual-HIV*. the translation rate of Rluc from pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV is smaller (about one-fifth) than that of the reporter mRNAs containing TAR-Poly(A) pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV, with the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 mRNA devoid of TAR-Poly(A), there is a slow decrease in frameshift efficiency in the presence of increasing quantities of Tat. this efficiency amounts to 80% of its value in absence of Tat for the lowest quantity of Tat expressed. the value in the absence of Tat was arbitrarily set at 1. The mRNA levels were quantified in cell lysates by qPCR. in all three cases, translation efficiency increases when Tat expression increases, likely accounting for the decrease in frameshift efficiency. a mutant of Tat, TatK41T (Kuppuswamy et al. 1989), is transcriptionally inactive. this mutant is located in a region involved in the interaction of Tat with various cellular proteins, among which is PKR. the expression of TatK41T in Jurkat T-cells was verified by Western blot. pDual-HIV* and pTP-HIV use a cap-dependent mode of initiation. pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV and p5\u2032UTR-HIV could use both the cap-dependent and the IRES-dependent initiation mode. pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV forced the ribosomes to use the IRES-dependent mode to translate the luciferases. plasmid p5\u2032UTR-HIV contains the complete 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA (nucleotides 1\u2013335 in pLAI) the plasmid pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV contains a part of the HIV-1 full-length mRNA 5\u2032 UTR (nucleotides 1\u2013335 in pLAI) the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA modulates HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. this increase mostly results from the presence of the TAR-Poly(A) region. the remaining structured region causes about a twofold increase in frameshift efficiency when introduced in p5\u2032UTR-HIV. the frameshift efficiency was found to be 9.1% 0.8% in pDual-HIV*. the variation of frameshift efficiency with pTP-HIV, p5\u2032UTR-HIV, and pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV reproduced the changes observed when comparing the fluc/Rluc ratios in the 1 constructs. each value represents the mean SEM of at least three independent triplicate experiments. the Rluc activities were divided by the corresponding mRNA levels. the p5\u2032UTR-HIV construct is arbitrarily set at 1. the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA increases frameshift efficiency by 1.5-fold compared with the control pDual-HIV*. pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV does not affect frameshift efficiency compared with pDual-HIV. the fluc/rluc ratio is shown relative to p5\u2032UTR-HIV. each value represents the mean SEM of at least three independent triplicate experiments. the different 5\u2032 UTRs were also seen to affect translation efficiency of Rluc in HEK 293T cells. the presence of the Tat viral protein counteracts the blockade imposed by TAR on translation initiation according to several researchers. however, this observation was contradicted by several studies. we investigated the effect of Tat on frameshift efficiency with luciferase reporters either containing the TAR-Poly(A) structures or not containing them. lysates from Jurkat T-cells cotransfected with pFRT-Tat, pDual-HIV, pTP-HIV, pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV, or pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV. the fluc/rluc ratio is presented relative to its value in absence of Tat, which is set at 100% for each construct. translation is twofold to fourfold that observed in absence of TAR-Poly(A) the effect of Tat is also stronger with the reporter using the IRES mode of initiation for the luciferases (pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV) in cultured cells, Tat stimulates translation of the different reporters, whether translation is cap-dependent or IRES-dependent. a ribosome that encounters an FSS downstream from a slippery sequence makes a pause that can result in a 1 frameshift. the ribosome then unfolds the FSS when continuing translation. a strong increase in the frameshift efficiency is observed in presence of the complete 5\u2032 UTR, or of only the TAR-Poly(A) stem\u2013loops. ribosomes encounter a folded FSS. a similar frameshift efficiency is observed in the presence of TAR-Poly(A), with or without the rest of the HIV-1 full-length mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. the absence of TAR corresponds to the situation observed with the control plasmid and plasmid pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV. the effect of Tat can be explained by the fact that it competes with eIF2 for phosphorylation or the inhibition of PKR by Tat. this stimulation is stronger than in the absence of TAR, implying that another effect of Tat is involved. we propose that Tat indirectly destabilizes TAR by increasing the amount of RNA helicases. other cellular proteins that destabilize the TAR stem\u2013loop could also participate in this effect. the same comment can apply to the Xenopus oocytes. mRNA 5\u2032 UTR that increase or decrease the activity of HIV-1 IRES by twofold did not affect the frameshift efficiency. a similar conclusion was reached by Berkhout et al. (2011), using a mutagenesis approach. the IRES could become important under conditions triggered by the viral infection. frameshift efficiency is extremely sensitive to the concentration of Tat. it is unlikely that the concentration of Tat remains invariable during the viral replication cycle. a decrease in frameshift efficiency handicaps HIV-1 replication. pDual-HIV contains the complete 5\u2032 UTR of the HIV-1 full-length mRNA (nucleotides 1\u2013335 from pLAI), where nucleotide 1 corresponds. pDual-HIV contains the complete 5\u2032 UTR of the HIV-1 mRNA. pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV contains a portion of the 5\u2032-UTR region of HIV-1 full-length mRNA lacking the TAR and poly(A) structures. in pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV, the translation initiation of the luciferases was made IRES-dependent by adding the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR. pFRT-Tat was derived from pCMV1-Tat (Gatignol et al. 1991) it expresses a Tat protein of 86 amino acids, which contains an HA tag. the fragment was amplified by PCR, using primers KK and LL. the cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. pcDNA5/FRT was added to maintain an equivalent DNA input. the cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. real-time analyses were performed on a light cycler 480 multi-well plate 96. the reaction samples contained 2 SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.125 M each of the gene-specific primers. the optimal thermal cycling parameters included a pre-incubation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C, for 15 sec at 65\u00b0C, and for 20 sec at 72\u00b0C. pDual-HIV contains a portion of the 5\u2032-UTR region of HIV-1 full-length mRNA lacking the TAR and poly(A) structures. pCAT-5\u2032UTR-HIV contains a short and unstructured 5\u2032 UTR. in-frame derivatives of pDual-HIV*, pTP-HIV, p5\u2032UTR-HIV, and pTP-5\u2032UTR-HIV were created. pFRT-Tat was derived from pCMV1-Tat (Gatignol et al. 1991) it expresses a Tat protein of 86 amino acids, which contains an HA tag. transfection of CD4+ Jurkat T-cells was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Wisent). transfection of these cells was made by electroporation, using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. the relative frameshift efficiency is assessed by the ratio of the Fluc activity to the Rluc activity (Fluc/Rluc) to this end, total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from CD4+ Jurkat T-cells or HEK 293T cells. DNAse I (Fermentas) was then used to remove DNA from the extract. a pre-incubation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 50 cycles of amplification for 10 sec at 95\u00b0C. controls lacking reverse transcriptase showed no significant amplification."}
