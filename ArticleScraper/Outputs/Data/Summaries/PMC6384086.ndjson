{"summary": "actin cytoskeleton is a network of fibers in eukaryotic cells that are involved in maintaining cell morphology and cell motility. viruses utilize the cytoskeleton system of a host cell to complete the infection process (2, 3) PHEV infection induces neurite damage and neuronal death, which may be the cause of neurological symptoms. integrins, a large family of transmembrane glycoproteins, play an important role in the regulation of various cellular functions. many pathogens, including viruses, facilitate their entry into and/or trafficking in cells by stimulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling. ase in the integrin signaling pathway activates Rac1 and Cdc42 (21) PHEV enters N2a cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. this process leads to rapid rearrangement of actin (22) but the role of actin rearrangement and molecular mechanisms responsible for its action remain unclear. PHEV entry into N2a cells induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia or stress fibers at different times. as early as 5 min postinfection, we observed dissolution of actin stress fibers and the appearance of filopodia and lamellipodia. however, stress fibers reappeared at 30 mpi. cytochalasin D (CytoD) binds to and cleaves F-actin and binds at the ends of the filaments to impede the polymerization of actin at that site. the entry of the virus is closely related to the dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton caused by the virus. cells treated with PHEV were labeled with anti-S protein monoclonal antibody (red), FITC-phalloidin (green), and Hoechst (blue) at different time points. at least 30 cells from five representative fields were counted in each experiment. PHEV infection induces cofilin biphasic activation. PHEV infection induces cofilin biphasic activation. sphincter and chronophin phosphatase dephosphorylate cofilin (20) cofilin was inactivated and gradually activated after 30 mpi. at least 30 cells from five representative fields were counted in each experiment. cofilin activity affects PHEV-induced actin cytoskeletal changes and viral entry. cofilin-specific short interfering RNA inhibited cofilin expression approximately 90% according to Western blotting, qPCR, and indirect immunofluorescence. all three constructs inhibited PHEV entry in a dose-dependent manner. cofilin may accumulate on cortical actin and participate in F-actin assembly and disassembly. cofilin-specific siRNAs could dilapidate cellular stress fibers, form small protrusions on the cell surface and fragment actin filaments into lumps. cofilin activity influences virus entry and participates in virus-induced cell membrane ruffle formation. overexpression of wild-type cofilin or mutants (S3A and S3D) inhibits PHEV entry. cells were transfected with plasmids and infected with PHEV for 2 h. signal molecules are usually mediated by receptors, lectins, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) the virus binds to the cell surface receptor and induces an intracellular signaling cascade that is predominantly tyrosine phosphorylated. we first examined whether RTKs were involved in virus entry and cofilin phosphorylation. different doses of integrin 51-specific inhibitor ATN-161 were used to treat cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cofilin and LIMK phosphorylation were detected by Western blotting. integrin 51 was significantly upregulated in the first 15 min of viral infection. Integrin 51 was probed with integrin 5 and integrin 1 antibodies. cells were infected with PHEV for 15 min and then fixed. indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed with anti-integrin 5/1 and anti-PHEV-S antibodies. active FAK was probed with a p-FAK antibody. different doses of the FAK-specific inhibitor PF-573228 were used to treat cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then infected with PHEV for 2 h. cofilin and LIMK phosphorylation were detected by Western blotting. integrin 51 promotes PHEV infiltration of cells and PHEV-induced early cofilin phosphorylation through the FAK signaling pathway. the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and is primarily manipulated by members of the Rho family of GTPases. Racl GTPase inhibitor EHoP-016 and ML-141 are involved in early cofilin phosphorylation and promote PHEV entry. different doses of EHoP-016 (EH) were used to treat cells for 1 h. different doses of EHoP-016 (EH) were used to treat cells for 1 h. treatment, pulldown assays performed as described above. all results were considered statistically significant at a P value of 0.05. the small G proteins of the Rho family play a regulatory role. both integrin 51 and FAK inhibitors affected Rac1 and Cdc42 activity induced by PHEV infection. integrin 51, FAK, Rac GTPase, and Cdc42 GTPases regulate cofilin phosphorylation during the early phase of PHEV infection. integrin pathway was not activated in inactivated PHEV-infected cells. cells were infected with PHEV, and cell lysates were analyzed with anti-PAK and anti-p-PAK antibodies. the changes in actin cytoskeleton of N2a cells caused by PHEV infection were assessed by confocal microscopy and staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin. PHEV or inactivated PHEV was added to N2a cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to synchronize infection before the cells were transferred to 37\u00b0C to initiate infection. cells with FITC-phalloidin were designated positive cells. each value represents the average value from 60 to 80 cells from at least 5 regions of 3 representative experiments. PHEV treatment causes cell actin polymerization and depolymerization. PHEV particles moved along the filopodia to penetrate the membrane surface of the cell membrane. at 60 mpi, PHEV particles had almost completely entered the cytoplasm. the entry of the cell primarily occurred after 15 mpi. PHEV infection induces cofilin biphasic activation. the cellular actin cytoskeleton is regulated by cofilin. cofilin cannot bind to actin when phosphorylated, and activity is reactivated. in all of the mock-infected experimental groups, the untreated cells were used as a control. in the PHEV-infected group, the cells that were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then transferred to 37\u00b0C for the indicated times without PHEV infection were used as the control (Mock) PHEV entry is inhibited when LIMK is knocked down. all results were considered statistically significant at a P value of 0.05. cofilin-specific siRNAs could dilapidate cellular stress fibers and form small protrusions on the cell surface. microscopic experiments showed that peripheral migration of the virus on cells mobilized cofilin. cofilin/WT expression and overexpression of mutant cofilin/S3A cells were positive for the cofilin rod-shaped structure. active cofilin can chelate actin, thereby reducing the production of wrinkles. cofilin is involved in virus-induced cell protrusion formation. cells were infected for 30 min, and then F-actin (red) or cofilin (green) was stained. all results were considered statistically significant at a P value of 0.05. integrin 51 inhibitor ATN-161 was used to treat cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the results showed that viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation were significantly affected. integrin 51 was significantly upregulated in the first 15 min of viral infection. integrin 51 was recruited to the virus entry site and colocalized with virus S protein. integrin 51 expression is upregulated during PHEV entry. cells were infected with PHEV for 15 min and then fixed. cofilin phosphorylation decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. different doses of the FAK-specific inhibitor PF-573228 were used to treat cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the FAK-centered integrin signaling pathway regulates two pathways. one is the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. the other is the FAK signaling pathway, which is independent of c-Src interaction. c42 regulate cell shape and migration through coordination (30) the FAK pathway can regulate cofilin phosphorylation by activating either Rac1 or Cdc42 (1). we pretreated cells with Rac1 or Cdc42 GTPase inhibitors to determine if they were upstream regulators of cofilin. lysates of cells treated with PDGF (20 ng/ml) or EGF (50 ng/ml) were incubated with GST-PBD. total Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins in lysates were analyzed. the cells were treated with PDGF and EGF to test the specificity of the established method. the results showed that GST-PBD interacted with intracellularly activated Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. integrin 51, FAK, Rac GTPase, and Cdc42 GTPase inhibitors reduced virus-induced PAK1 phosphorylation. IPA3 also inhibited the generation of filopodia and lamellipodia that were caused by PHEV infection. integrin pathway was not activated in inactivated PHEV-infected cells. N2a cells were incubated with inactivated PHEV (MOI of 50) for 1 h. cells were harvested at the indicated time points. no effective prevention or treatment measures exist for this disease. PHEV promotes viral entry by regulating cofilin activity and inducing dynamic actin polymerization and depolymerization. in early stages of infection, PHEV stimulates the dynamic phosphorylation of cofilin and polymerizes F-actin via the integrin 51-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling pathway. many viruses have developed mechanisms that allow them to exploit these structures to facilitate their replication. murine leukemia virus (MLV) must bind to receptors via actin to form a virus-receptor complex and move to a suitable location for the virus to complete endocytosis (43). Poliovirus also utilizes the actin- and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways into the cell (45) integrins are heterodimers formed by the different pairings of 18 and 8 subunits. most viruses affect the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton of host cells. integrin 51 inhibitor ATN-161 blocked PHEV infection by inhibiting the downstream signaling cascade. actin cytoskeleton rearrangement requires the regulation of the upstream Rho GTPase family. both Rac1 and Cdc42 affected the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating cofilin activity through downstream PAK molecules. the activation time of Rac1 and Cdc42 in PHEV invasion of N2a cells was different. in the stage of virus invasion, the activation of Cdc42 was earlier than that of Rac1. we identified specific mechanisms of cytoskeletal remodeling during PHEV entry into N2a cells. cofilin activity regulation provides a link between cytoskeletal remodeling and viral entry processes. cells were washed with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed with PBS (pH 7.2 at 4\u00b0C) to remove viruses bound to the cell membrane. then TRIzol or radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer was added to collect samples. mouse anti-PHEV-S antibody was a laboratory-prepared monoclonal antibody. FITC-phalloidin was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) PCR products were purified using a gel extraction kit and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) the initial copy number of PHEV S gene and GAPDH in each group was calculated using the formula X = K log(CT + b), where X is the initial copy number and K, CT, and b refer to the slope rate, cycle threshold, and constant. pEGFP-cofilin-WT, pEGFP-cofilin-S3A and pEGFP-cofilin-S3D were constructed as described in the literature (52) for the RNA interference assay, N2a cells were transfected with siRNA using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent. FITC-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), or Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody was incubated with PBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cell lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was incubated with purified GST-PBD protein on a rotary mixer overnight at 4\u00b0C. after washing three times, the lysis buffer and the volume of 5 loading buffer were added into the EP tube. strain used in this experiment was PHEV 67 N (GenBank accession no. AY078417), which was propagated in N2a cells and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. cells were incubated with PHEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2 at 4\u00b0C) three times to remove unbound virus, and then maintained antibodies against cofilin, phospho-cofilin, integrin 5, integrin 1, FAK, phospho-FAK, Src, phospho-Src, Rac1 and Cdc42 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) antibodies against RhoA, PAK1, and phospho-PAK1 were purchased from abcam (Cambridge, UK) the cytotoxicity of chemical inhibitors was determined with a cell-counting kit. the cofilin siRNA target sequence was GGATCAAGCATGAATTGCAAGCAAA. total RNA from N2a cells infected with PHEV was extracted using qRT-PCR. the concentration of protein was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed for 30 min in RIPA buffer. pEGFP-cofilin-WT, pEGFP-cofilin-S3A and pEGFP-cofilin-S3D were constructed. cells were plated in 12-well plates with coverslips at a density of 1 104 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were incubated with PHEV at an MOI of 50 for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and then shifted to 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. cdc42 binding domains (PBDs) of PAK1 were first cloned into a plasmid encoding the fusion protein GST-PBD in Escherichia coli BL21 in pGEX-4T-1. GST-PBD was then affinity purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. none of the concentrations of chemicals used in this experiment resulted in significant cytotoxic effects on cell viability. each experiment was repeated at least 3 times."}
