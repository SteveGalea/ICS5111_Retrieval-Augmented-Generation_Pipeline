{"summary": "natural human exhalation flows such as coughing, sneezing and breathing can be considered as \u2018jet-like\u2019 airflows in the sense that they are produced from a single source in a single exhalation effort. these are relatively rare events during daily life whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. ezing in premature newborns suggested that the peak expiratory airflow during sneezing was only 6\u20137 times higher than that during quiet breathing [18]. this ratio suggests that there may be a discrepancy with the much higher estimates of sneeze velocities reported by Wells [19] of up to 100 m/s, and 50 m/s as has been assumed in some modeling studies. a large, finely ground, 1-m diameter, spherical, concave, f/5 mirror of astronomical reflector telescope quality (Cosmo Optics Inc., Middletown, NY) was used to reflect a light beam produced by an LED light source placed at the mirror\u2019s centre of curvature. volunteers were asked to stand approximately 1 m in front of, and just to one side of the mirror in order to maximise the extent of their exhaled flows. twenty healthy volunteers (10 women: mean age 32.212.9 years, mean height 1.600.07 m, mean weight 53.287.23 kg, mean BMI 21.043.63; 10 men: mean age 25.32.5 years, mean height 1.690.06 m, mean weight 63.37.00 kg, mean BMI 22.171.92) were recruited based on their ability to sneeze with the approved pepper stimulus. two independent observers performed breathing or sneezing airflow images using large (17\u201319\u201d), flat-screen LCD monitors at up to 200% magnification. the observers stepped backwards and forwards to ensure the continuity of the images, to digitize its airflow boundaries as accurately as possible. kinematic parameters, such as the propagation velocity and the two-dimensional (2-D) area expansion rate, were derived. the cough plume was calculated and plotted using custom-written algorithms in C++ and Matlab codes. in this analysis, the algorithm to calculate the propagation distance and derived velocities from these images differs slightly from that used to calculate the horizontal (i.e. the x-direction resolved component) propagation distance and derived velocity was obtained and compared. a high-speed camera (Photron SA1.1, Dynamic Analysis System, Pte Ltd, Singapore) was used to capture these reflected shadowgraph images at high frame-rates. the maximum size of the image file recordable by the high-speed camera at any one time was limited to 32 GB (compressed) size. the maximum size of the image file recordable by the camera at any one time was limited to 32 GB (compressed) size. the volunteers were asked to breathe through their nose then through their mouth in front of the mirror. three cycles of nasal (15\u201320 seconds) then 3 cycles of mouth breathing (15\u201320 seconds), were recorded. for sneeze, none of these initial 20 volunteers were able to sneeze. volunteers recruited based on their ability to sneeze in response to the approved pepper stimulus. several bouts of sneezing from each volunteer were recorded, until they became tolerant to the pepper stimulus. using raw distance data was thought to be unrepresentative of the true nature of the airflow. to compensate for this, a smoothing algorithm was applied to obtain more representative velocity estimates as derived from this raw digitized distance data. the maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m. the maximum 2-D area of the sneeze plumes (Figure 3B) was 0.2 m2, with the corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate equal to 2 m2/s. the profile of these nasal and mouth breathing curves are relatively similar. the maximum visible distance over which the cough travelled was 0.7 m, with a maximum (i.e. not the purely horizontal, x-component) derived velocity of 5 m/s. the maximum 2-D area for coughing was 0.2 m2, with the corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate equal to 1.5 m2/s. the range of cough velocities reported here are within the range of 1.5\u201328.8 m/s, as reported elsewhere by several other teams using different techniques. there are relatively few estimates of sneeze velocities reported in the literature. the few existing estimates are considerably higher than those found in this study. sneeze velocities may vary with different measurement methods, as well as physical attributes, lung capacities and any constrained postures imposed on the human volunteers. early experiments by Jennison and colleagues using strobe lighting and high-speed photography [25], [26] reported sneeze velocities as high as 46 m/s. fewer images were available for analysis as there were fewer volunteers in the sneeze cohort. it is acknowledged that higher sneeze velocities may well be possible with other volunteers, and that further studies are encouraged to explore and better characterize this variable. the variations in the airflow velocities of the nasal and mouth breathing exhalation flows can be related to the variation of airflow rates during expiration. this is due to a combination of lung tissue and diaphragmatic elasticity and recoil and elasticity that have been well-documented. this study adds new data using a new, non-invasive, visualization approach to the airflow dynamics of sneezing and breathing. it also makes a direct comparison between maximum cough and sneeze velocities using this shadowgraph method."}
