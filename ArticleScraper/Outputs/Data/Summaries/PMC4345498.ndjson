{"summary": "early work was carried out by Cliff and co-workers on the geographical spread of measles in Iceland. they showed that pre-1938 measles in Iceland was characterized by isolated outbreaks separated by long (up to 8 years) disease-free periods. the whole system behaves as a forced oscillator, except that the forcing is not provided by any external source. the same approach was demonstrated in a susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered model with demography [8]. a model for human mobility was recently developed [19] that depends only on a single parameter that can be fitted to available datasets on mobility for a specific country. computer model combines three level of descriptions: population level, providing a detailed geographical distribution of human population; epidemiological level, detailing how the disease evolves. the database also provides maps with a 30 arc-second resolution. however, transmission within the cell occurs as in a well-mixed model. we allow each individual to move to a different cell with a given probability. the flux between locations is controlled by a single parameter Nc/N. it represents the fraction of individuals in the population that participate in the long-distance displacements and thus controls the level of transmission to different cells. increasing Nc/N the number of individuals leaving each cell never exceeds the population of the cell. each chosen with probability pij, and location i with probability 1 pi. the associated probabilities form a discrete distribution that can be used to extract preferred locations. the result is a list of distinct locations with an associated frequency of visit that can be used to decide where the individual should be moved to. algorithm performs a multi-level coarsening of the gridded map in order to obtain a coarsed map that is composed by a small number of coarsed grid elements. the map is then decoarsened one level at a time, and the final part of a simulated annealing algorithm is performed to adapt the optimal solution found at the coarser level to the new decoarsed level. no qualitative difference appears instead among simulations with L = 2. we did not explore any further dependence on L, reserving an eventual exploration for later studies. the total number of infectives at equilibrium is dependent on the number of infective classes L only through R0. individuals are initially assigned one epidemiological class with a probability proportional to the corresponding endemic equilibrium prevalence. resulting set-up does not correspond to the local endemic equilibrium, but it is sufficiently close to it: the system settles after about 7\u20138 years of simulated time. the value of this ratio should be referred to the interval of years corresponding to that of available pre-vaccination data that, for measles, range between 1944 and 1966. however, there is no available information about mobility for those years. we used mobility as a proxy to investigate its influence on the dynamics. the model describes a collection of isolated well-mixed populations. in the map under consideration, all cells have a population below the critical community size. this corresponds to lack of mobility of individuals who are constrained to their residence cell. however, the specific threshold is influenced by the size of the cells. for higher values of Nc/N, the average infective incidence achieves a level close to that of the endemic equilibrium (figure 1a) however, the overall dynamics for low and high mobility differ, as shown in figure 1b\u2013e. we simplify the shape of the city to a circle centred on the geographical centre of the city. the radius of the circle is fine-tuned to get a population close to that reported in census data. in both cases, the plot shows a regular series of biennial epidemics, compatible with the data available for the area of London. city population: simulated 7 779 671 individuals; data 3 249 440. a) Nc/N = 0.05, 1 = 0.25; b) Nc/N = 0.2, 1 = 0.25; d) Historical time series. all other disease parameters are as described in the main text. the time series of measles incidence are quite irregular, but a detailed analysis shows several extinction events. for lower values of the mobility ratio, extinction events combined with lower mobility become increasingly important. the lower number of imports results in more spaced outbreaks, with a frequency for the main peaks roughly triennial. the movie in the electronic supplementary material shows that the region of Chester is exposed to waves propagating from the neighbouring large cities and to waves coming from the south and west. the month and year refer to simulation time. the stochastic fluctuations have a periodicity of 2 years for measles. the city population: simulations 111 254 individuals; data 105 150. for the highest values used, the period of outbreaks converges to a biennial cycle for all cases. for the highest values used, the period of outbreaks converges to a biennial cycle for all cases. for the highest values used, the period of outbreaks converges to a biennial cycle for all cases. models have been studied in detail at the level of cities on models where the population is well mixed. the new ingredient is a realistic description of mobility at a level of detail and on an area which extends to the whole British Isles. the level of mobility of individuals influences disease incidence both locally and globally. the results summed up in figure 8 show the complex dependence of the period of outbreaks on the mobility ratio. the response of the city of London to variations of the level of human mobility is unique when compared with that of smaller locations. the global time series show biennial cycles for high levels of mobility, whereas intermediate and low levels of mobility lead to annual cycles, in contrast with what occurs at the local level. we have not explored higher values of the number of infective classes nor SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) simulations. we selected seasonality and disease parameter values as used in previous simulation works for measles, but did not perform any sensitivity analysis. a recent paper has shown that the radiation model and mobile-tracking data can provide complementary results on the study of the spatial spread of infectious diseases."}
