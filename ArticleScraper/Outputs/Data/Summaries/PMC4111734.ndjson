{"summary": "nucleocapsid proteins typically enwrap viral genomes for protection and transport but also promote viral transcription and replication steps through interactions with viral polymerase components. high-throughput sequencing allows the characterization of nucleic acid compartments within protein-DNA or protein-RNA complexes. MV produces defective interfering (DI) particles containing only a portion of the virus genetic information. in the absence of viral RNA, nucleoproteins of Mononegavirales are able to self-assemble onto cellular RNA to form nucleocapsid-like particles. this self-assembly is believed to be sequence independent. a reverse genetics approach was used and a recombinant MV strain expressing an additional tagged MV-N protein was engineered. a sequence encoding the MV-N protein fused to a C-terminal One-STrEP tag was introduced in an additional transcription unit (ATU) within the MV genome. -N proteins are efficiently incorporated into viral RNPs. these results strongly suggest that by purifying one-STrEP-tagged MV-N, it is extracted in a form of viral ribonucleocapsid. in contrast, the negative control One-STrEP-tagged CH protein was efficiently expressed by rMV2/CH-STrEP but failed to incorporate into viral ribonucleocapsids. one-STrEP-tagged proteins were detected using Streptavidin-HRP. to co-purify MV-N and associated RNA molecules, HEK-293T cells were infected with rMV2/N-STrEP virus. after 24 h of culture, cells were harvested and one-STrEP-tagged MV-N together with associated partners was purified from total cell lysates. eukaryotic total RNA assay of MV-N/RNA samples reveals a distinct band slightly above 1,000 nucleotides. total RNA purified from cells infected with rMV2/CH-STrEP or rMV2/N-STrEP viruses or RNA samples after purification on StrepTactin Sepharose beads. RNA molecules that co-purified with MV-N showed a strong enrichment in viral sequences when compared with the CH/RNA sample. this can be explained by the preferential association of MV genomes and anti-genomes to MV-N within viral nucleocapsids. this suggests specific MV-N-associated RNAs are most likely of viral origin. X RNA fragment mapped to the 5\u2032 end of the MV genome was 15 times more abundant in MV-N/RNA samples compared with the rest of the viral genome. this RNA fragment was not detected in CH/RNA samples and probably corresponds to the RNA fragment visualized using Agilent analysis. previous studies have mapped 5\u2032 copy-back defective interfering RNA genomes (DI-RNA) to the 5\u2032 end of MV genomes. the X RNA species over-represented in purified nucleocapsid reads corresponded to DI-RNA molecules. samples were reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR (RT-PCR) with DI-RNA-specific primers. RT-PCR was performed on MV-N/RNA samples, but not on CH/RNA samples. RT-PCRs were performed using DI-RNA-specific primers (A and C) or standard genome-specific primers (A and B) amplification of the 5\u2032 copy-back 1,212 nucleotide-long DI genome of MV. nucleotides at position where viral polymerase resumes synthesis are indicated and shown in bold. the 1,212 nucleotide-long MV DI-RNA was cell-dependent. we compared DI-RNA levels produced by rMV2/N-STrEP. a low-passage Schwarz vaccine strain of MV grown for five consecutive passages. total RNA was purified and 1 g of each RNA sample was analyzed by RT-qPCR against either the 1,212 nucleotide-long DI-RNA or the full-length MV genome. RT-qPCR was performed against either the 1,212 nucleotide-long DI-RNA or the full-length MV genome. the 1,212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032 copy-back MV DI-RNA triggers efficient interferon induction via RIG-I 5\u2032 copy-back DI-RNA molecules from negative-strand RNA viruses. the 1,212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032 copy-back MV DI-RNA triggers efficient interferon induction via RIG-I 5\u2032 copy-back DI-RNA molecules from negative-strand RNA viruses. transfection of MV-N-associated RNA into reporter cells resulted in a 16-fold increase in reporter activity compared with the CH control. the immunostimulatory activity of total RNA samples purified from cells infected with rMV2/N-STrEP or rMV2/CH-STrEP failed to show any difference. this indicates that the RNA molecules specifically purified in association with the MV-N protein had a significant immunostimulatory activity. samples were analyzed in triplicates and two biological replicates were performed. we tested whether the 1,212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032 copy-back MV DI-RNA exerts its immunostimulatory activity via cellular cytoplasmic sensors such as MDA5 and RIG-I. a sequence encoding the MV-N protein fused to a C-terminal One-STrEP tag was introduced in an additional transcription unit within the MV genome. a recombinant virus expressing the Cherry protein was used instead of MV-N (rMV2/CH-STrEP, Fig. 1A) rMV2/CH-STrEP-tagged MV-N, P and V did not co-purify with CH-STrEP from cells infected with rMV2/CH-STrEP. this confirms that one-STrEP-tagged MV-N specifically interacts with known interactors of MV-N. one-STrEP-tagged proteins were detected using Streptavidin-HRP. to co-purify MV-N and associated RNA molecules, HEK-293T cells were infected with rMV2/N-STrEP virus. co-affinity purification experiments were performed in parallel with rMV2/N-STrEP virus. MV-N/RNA and CH/RNA samples revealed a substantial fraction of rRNA. this can be explained by non-specific binding of abundant cellular RNAs to the StrepTactin Sepharose beads used for purification. but the profile of RNA molecules that co-purified with one-STrEP-tagged MV-N presented a prominent and specific band slightly above 1,000 nucleotides. sequences were mapped to human and MV genomes. RNA molecules that co-purified with MV-N showed a strong enrichment in viral sequences when compared with the CH/RNA sample. this can be explained by the preferential association of MV genomes and anti-genomes to MV-N within viral RNP complexes. a 1,114 nucleotide-long sequence that mapped to the 5\u2032 end of the MV genome was 15 times more abundant in MV-N/RNA samples compared with the rest of the viral genome. a vast majority corresponded to the last 1,114 nucleotides of the MV genome, thus matching the X RNA fragment. previous studies have mapped 5\u2032 copy-back defective interfering RNA genomes (DI-RNA) to the 5\u2032 end of X RNA species over-represented in purified nucleocapsid reads correspond to DI-RNA molecules. RT-PCR was performed on MV-N/RNA samples, but not on CH/RNA samples. RT-PCR amplicon contains all the DI-RNA features described above. anti-leader (Le\u2019) and anti-trailer (Tr\u2019) sequences are shown as light gray and dark gray rectangles, respectively, and trail sequence (Tr\u2019), as a black rectangle. RT-PCRs were performed using DI-RNA-specific primers (A and C) or standard genome-specific primers (A and B) the precise conditions that determine the production of DI-RNA genomes are poorly characterized. we first determined whether the production of the 1,212 nucleotide-long MV DI-RNA was cell-dependent. we compared DI-RNA levels produced by rMV2/N-STrEP, or a low-passage Schwarz vaccine strain of MV. total RNA was purified and 1 g of each RNA sample was analyzed by RT-qPCR against either the 1,212 nucleotide-long DI-RNA or the full-length MV genome. Absolute quantification was performed using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed MV DI-RNA. samples were analyzed in triplicates, with standard deviation represented on the figure. the 1,212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032 copy-back MV DI-RNA triggers efficient interferon induction via RIG-I 5\u2032 copy-back DI-RNA molecules from negative-strand RNA viruses. the 1,212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032 copy-back MV DI-RNA triggers efficient interferon induction via RIG-I 5\u2032 copy-back DI-RNA molecules. MV-N/RNA and CH/RNA samples were transfected into the STING-37 reporter cell line. this cell line stably expresses a firefly luciferase gene under control of a promoter sequence containing five IFN-stimulated response elements. transfection of MV-N-associated RNA into reporter cells resulted in a 16-fold increase in reporter activity compared with the CH control. reporter cells were transfected with siRNA targeting RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS or TPR (negative control) second transfection of the cells was performed 48 h later with either 1,212 nucleotide-long MV DI-RNA, poly(IC) or 5\u2032PPP-bearing short RNA. luciferase induction fold is expressed as the ratio of luciferase measured within stimulated by second RNA transfection cells to the ratio of luci affinity chromatography and next-generation sequencing allowed us to identify the specific MV-N-interacting RNA molecule that interplays with the host cellular innate immunity. the data were normalized to the GAPDH mRNA levels and expressed as relative levels of mRNA compared with cells without siRNA transfection (siCTRL) a new method was developed to map virus-host RNA-protein interactions. this approach made it possible to capture specific RNA-binding partners of MV-N. the MV-N protein specifically interacted with the 1,212 nucleotide-long RNA molecule corresponding to 5\u2032 copy-back DI genomes. new sequencing technologies can sequence up to one billion bases in a single day. high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by immunoprecipitation is emerging as an important method to understand RNA-protein interactions. however, immunoprecipitation relies on the availability of high-affinity antibodies directed to epitopes that remain accessible within the complex. this study suggests using recombinant viruses expressing tagged viral proteins to perform affinity chromatography purification of tagged viral proteins from infected cells. the MV-N-tagged protein was efficiently incorporated into viral RNP. insertion of tagged nucleoprotein strongly enhanced the production of the 1,212 nucleotide-long DI-RNA. this suggests that an additional copy of MV-N somehow perturbed the MV replication complex leading to massive production of the DI genomes. the MV 5\u2032 copy-back DI-RNA identified here is a multiple of six nucleotides. this suggests that DI genomes of Paramyxovirinae follow the rule of six to achieve efficient encapsidation and replication. recombinant viruses efficiently expressing DI genomes might be of great practical importance for vaccinology due to their ability to stimulate the innate immunity response. this is different from the study by Routh et al. in which only assembled virions or virus-like particles were purified and analyzed for their association with RNA molecules. a similar strategy could be applied to other viruses for which tagged viral proteins can be introduced into the viral genome or expressed within a cell via transfection. a total of 44 clones were screened for luciferase expression. a total of 44 clones were screened for luciferase expression. the MV Schwarz vaccine strain and two recombinant MVs were expressing an additional N or CH protein. infected cells were harvested by centrifugation at 200 g and 8 ml of each culture medium fractions were collected for analysis of cell-free viral particles. cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl) at 1 107 cells/ml. one-STrEP-tag purification of MV-N/RNA and CH/RNA complexes and subsequent RNA extraction HEK-293T cells (3.6 108) were infected with rMV2/N-STrEP or rMV2/CH-STrEP at a MOI of 1, and 24 h post-infection the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 18 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM MOPS-KOH pH 7.
