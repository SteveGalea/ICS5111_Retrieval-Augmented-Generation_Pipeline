ARI was defined as the development of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks before undergoing the RVM-RT-PCR test. a patient was considered to have a community-acquired ARI if he or she had had an ARI within 2 days after admission. the diagnosis of a lung destroyed by tuberculosis was based on the presence of present or past tuberculosis with a finding of parenchymal. nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained with flocked swabs were submitted in universal transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy) nucleic acids were extracted from 300-l specimens using a Viral Gene-spin viral DNA/RNA extraction kit. cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA with a cDNA synthesis premix (Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea) l of 5 RV primer, 4 l of 8-methoxypsoralen, and 4 l of 5 master mix with a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 18.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) a patient was considered to have a community-acquired ARI if he or she had had an ARI within 2 days after admission. patients who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, and a lung destroyed by tuberculosis were considered to have chronic lung disease. the diagnosis of a lung destroyed by tuberculosis was based on the presence of present or past tuberculosis with a finding of cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA with a cDNA synthesis premix. testing was performed to detect 16 RVs, 14 RNA viruses and 2 DNA viruses. an internal control was added to each specimen to check the entire process from nucleic acid extraction to PCR. continuous variables were compared using Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. variables which had 5 events per variable and had P values of 0.1 in the univariate analysis were included in the logistic regression analysis. fifty percent of the study population (n = 95) had pneumonia, and 34 (17.9%) were admitted to the ICU. the baseline characteristics and symptoms of the patients were compared to those in patients with SRVD. patients with SRVD (n = 164) Crude OR 95% CI P value Male sex 10 (38.5) 69 (42.1) 0.86 0.37\u20132.01 0.73 Median (range) age (yr) 68 (16\u201394) 67 (16\u201394) 0.85 Age group (yr) 0.89 16\u201339 3 (11.5) 28 (17.1) 40\u201364 7 (26.9) 43 (26.2) 65\u201379 11 (42.3) 60 (36.6) 80 5 (19.2) 0.05\u20133.14 0.70 Congestive heart failure 1 (3.8) 7 (4.3) 0.90 0.11\u20137.61 1.00 Absolute neutrophil count of 500/lb 1 (3.8) 4 (2.4) 1.60 0.18\u201314.90 0.52 Immunosuppressive agent usec 1 (3.8) 7 (4.3) 0.90 0.11\u20137.61 1.00 Chemotherapyc 1 (3.8) 5 (3.0) 1.27 0.14\u201311.34 0.59 Surgeryc 0 3 ( antiviral therapy 12 (46.2) 75 (45.7) 1.02 0.44\u20132.33 0.97 Antimicrobial therapy 23 (88.5) 139 (85.3) 1.32 0.37\u20134.76 1.00 Outcomes In-hospital mortality 2 (7.7) 7 (4.3) 1.87 0.37\u20139.53 0.35 14-day mortality 2/22 (9.1) 3/140 (2.1) 4.57 0.72\u201329.03 0.14 28-day mortality 2/18 (11.1) 6/130 (4.6) 2.58 0. the distribution of the 16 RVs in patients with MRVD and those with SRVD is presented in Table 3.

DISCUSSION MRVD was detected in 13.7% of hospitalized adult patients with RVM-RT-PCR-positive ARI. patients with MRVD had higher rates of chronic lung disease and mechanical ventilation than patients with SRVD. the rate of detection in recent PCR studies (of all age groups) ranges from 7.4 to 23.3% (5\u201310, 14, 15) in the near future MRVD may be detected more frequently using newer viral diagnostics. MRVD data on adult patients are extremely rare. on severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission, included only 9 patients with MRVD. the other, which focused on the 2009 influenza pandemic, showed a longer hospital stay in the MRVD group than in the SRVD group. the other, which focused on the 2009 influenza pandemic, showed a longer hospital stay in the MRVD group than in the SRVD group. MRVD may suggest that the patient has repeated RV infections within a short time due to an impaired respiratory immune system. HRV, HEV, ADV, and HCoV 229E were more commonly found in the patients with MRVD than in the patients with SRVD. several studies performed in pediatric patients suggested that RSV increased the severity of coinfection of another RV (12, 13, 24) however, the impact of RSV could not be evaluated in our study because of the small number of RSV infections in adult patients with MRVD."}
