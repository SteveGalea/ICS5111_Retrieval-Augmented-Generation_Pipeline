{"summary": "entry of enveloped viruses involves two steps: receptor binding and membrane fusion. lysosomes play critical roles in cell metabolism by breaking down biomolecules and cellular debris. lysosomal protease activities are central to the functions of lysosomes (7). the membrane fusion step by coronavirus spikes requires two prior cleavages by host proteases. for MERS-CoV, the spike can be processed by proprotein convertases (e.g., furin) during the molecular maturation process in virus-producing cells. it was previously reported that MERS-CoV spike could be processed by furin after viral endocytosis in virus-targeted cells. both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are thought to have originated from bats. the species and tissue tropisms of coronaviruses are correlated with different lysosomal proteases from different hosts or tissue cells. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells process coronavirus spikes differently and activate coronavirus entry differently. these studies did not provide direct biochemical evidence to demonstrate that lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells process coronavirus spikes differently. factor-controlled viral entry data and direct biochemical data are needed to establish the correlation between lysosomal protease activities and coronavirus tropism. coronavirus of interest was screened in human, monkey, and bat cell lines. to identify and exclude cells that endogenously expressed coronavirus receptors, we performed coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus entry in human, monkey, and bat cell lines. the results showed that among these cells, Huh7 cells, Vero cells, MRC5 cells, PESU-B5L cells, and RSKT cells all supported significant levels of MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry. previous studies showed that PESU-B5L cells do not support the infection of MERS-CoV and that Huh7 cells support the infection of SARS-CoV. error bars indicate standard errors of the mean (n = 5) different cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding human DPP4 (hDPP4) expression level of human DPP4 in each cell lines was detected through Western blotting using an antibody recognizing its C-terminal C9 tag. the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean (n = 5). lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. lysosomal proteases from b-Tb1-Lu cells supported MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry more efficiently than both h-HEK293T and h-Hela cells. lysosomal proteases from b-Tb1-Lu cells supported MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry more efficiently than h-HEK293T cells and h-Hela cells. furin inhibitor chloromethyl ketone, the cell surface protease (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, and the lysosomal protease (i.e., cathepsin) inhibitor E64d were used in parallel experiments. expression levels of cell surface-associated C9-tagged human DPP4 were measured through Western blot analysis using an anti-C9 tag monoclonal antibody. purified lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells, h-HeLa cells, b-Tb1-Lu cells, and bat BKD9 cells. lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells activate MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from h-HEK293T cells. lysosomal extracts from bat cells support MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal extracts from bat cells support MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activated SARS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. results showed that lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activated SARS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells support SARS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion. the experiments were performed in the same way as for Fig. 2, except that SARS-CoV spike and its receptor, human ACE2 (hACE2), replaced MERS-CoV spike and human DPP4 respectively. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells process MERS-CoV spike differently. lysosomal extracts from b-BKD9 cells processed MERS-CoV spike more efficiently than their counterparts from h-HEK293T cells. lysosomal extracts from b-BKD9 cells demonstrated higher efficiency in processing MERS-CoV spike than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells and b-Tb1-Lu cells cleaved lysosomal protease motif to produce S2. lysosomal extracts from both h-HEK293T cells and b-Tb1-Lu cells can process the glycosylated lysosomal protease motif in HKU4 spike. lysosomal protease motif in HKU4 spike replaced MERS-CoV spike. the experiments were repeated five times, and representative results are shown. to this end, we screened for cells that met three criteria. to identify and exclude cells that endogenously expressed coronavirus receptors, we performed coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus entry in a number of human, monkey, and bat cell lines. to this end, retroviruses pseudotyped with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV spike (i.e., MERS-CoV pseudoviruses, respectively) were used to test the endogenous levels of receptor expression from different cell lines. studies showed that PESU-B5L cells do not support the infection of MERS-CoV and that Huh7 cells support the infection of SARS-CoV (35, 40, 44, 46\u201348) the cells that endogenously expressed significant levels of DPP4 or ACE2 were not suitable for studying the roles of lysosomal proteases in coronavirus entry. there was no statistical significance under different conditions within each cell group. we transfected the cells with a plasmid encoding human DPP4. we then performed Western blotting using an antibody recognizing the C-terminal C9 tag of exogenously expressed human DPP4 in the cells. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. lysosomal proteases from human and bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion differently. all three types of cells supported MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry at significant levels when they exogenously expressed human DPP4. furin inhibitor and cell surface protease (TMPRSS2) inhibitor had much less impact on the efficiency of the cells in supporting MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry. thus, lysosomal proteases from b-Tb1-Lu cells supported MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from h-HEK293T cells and h-HeLa cells. h-HEK293T cells exogenously expressing MERS-CoV spike were mixed at pH 5.6 in the presence of lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells, h-HeLa cells, b-Tb1-Lu cells, or b-BKD9 cells. cell-cell fusion efficiency was characterized using luciferase activity accompanying fusion and calibrated against the highest fusion efficiency. lysosomal extracts from b-Tb1-Lu and b-BKD9 cells activate MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal extracts from bat cells support MERS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) are markers of plasma enzymes and ER enzymes. their activities in lysosomal extracts are commonly used as indicators of the purity of lysosomal extracts. compared to whole-cell lysates, the ALP and CPR activities in the lysosomal extracts were low. lysosomal proteases were the main contributor to SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry into the cells. lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells activated SARS-CoV spike-mediated cell-cell fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. lysosomal extracts from b-BKD9 cells processed MERS-CoV spike more efficiently than their counterparts from h-HEK293T cells. lysosomal extracts from b-BKD9 cells processed MERS-CoV spike more efficiently than their counterparts from h-HEK293T cells in a time-dependent manner. the cleavage state of MERS-CoV spike was detected through Western blotting. the experiments were repeated five times, and representative results are shown. lysosomal extracts from h-HEK293T cells and b-Tb1-Lu cells incubated individually with HKU4 spike. lysosomal extracts from both h-HEK293T cells and b-Tb1-Lu cells cleaved the mutant HKU4 spike to produce S2. the mutation had been shown to remove the glycosylation from the lysosomal protease motif in HKU4 spike. lysosomal extracts from both h-HEK293T cells and b-Tb1-Lu cells can process the extracellular proteases and other cellular proteases have been shown to be important determinants of coronavirus tropism (22, 23, 26, 29\u201331), but their roles in coronavirus tropism have not been established. in contrast, extracellular proteases and other cellular proteases have been shown to be important determinants of coronavirus tropism (22, 23, 26, 29\u201331) the current study investigated the roles of lysosomal proteases from the above-mentioned human and bat cells in coronavirus entry using a combination of pseudovirus entry, cell-cell fusion, and biochemical assays. to this end, we exogenously expressed human DPP4 in different types of cells and performed MERS-CoV spike-mediated pseudovirus entry and cell-cell fusion. the physiological reason for different lysosomal protease activities among mammalian species is not clear, but it could be due to the different lifestyles of these species. supporting coronavirus entry efficiently could be a by-product of the enhanced lysosomal proteases of bat cells.
