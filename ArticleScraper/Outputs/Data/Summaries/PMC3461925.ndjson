{"summary": "pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease of skin and mucous membranes. autoantibodies bind to the cadherin-type cell-cell adhesion molecules desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and DSG1, the main constituents of desmosomes. the disease activity correlates with anti-DSG3 antibody titers. polyclonal antibodies in PV serum react primarily with the aminoterminus of DSG3 in the EC1 and EC2 subdomains (amino acids 1\u2013161) (10, 11) isolation of pathogenic mAbs is instrumental for addressing questions as to the mechanism that induces the autoreactive response. peripheral blood samples were collected from 2 patients with mucocutaneous PV. one with long-lasting steroid-resistant disease (PVA) and the other prior to treatment initiation (PVB). cultures that produced specific antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution. the antibodies used different genes encoding the immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains. a higher level of replacing mutations was found in CDRs of both VH and VL. alignment of the H-CDR3 sequences did not reveal shared motifs. but identified an aromatic cluster (YYYYF) at the tip of H-CDR3 of the PVA224 antibody (Supplemental Figure 2). Taken together, our data indicate that in PV patients, the antibody response is polyclonal, is not biased toward a particular V gene. in vitro and in vivo pathogenic activity of anti-DSG3 antibodies. keratinocytes were seeded to confluence, and mAb PVA224 and a control antibody were added. cells were incubated with dispase I to detach the monolayer. antibodies PVA224 and PVB28 induced macroscopic blisters, intraepidermal suprabasal blistering, and intercellular deposition of human IgG in the epidermis. as a control, antibodies PVB16 and PVB124 did not cause macroscopic or microscopic blisters or IgG deposition in the epidermis. the 2 EC2-specific pathogenic antibodies PVB28 and PVB124 cross-competed for binding to DSG3. the EC1-specific antibody PVA224 was found to recognize a peptide from the linear library (KITYRISGVGIDQPP) and a conformation-dependent peptide from the double CLIPS library. EC1-EC2 interface involved in cis-interaction of cadherin molecules required to form lateral strand dimers (8). peptides recognized by PVA224 on the DSG2 EC1 nuclear magnetic resonance structure. cis-interaction of cadherin molecules required to form lateral strand dimers (8). cadherin defines 2 discontinuous overlapping epitopes in the EC2 region that are expected to interact in cis with the EC1 of the neighboring molecule. the proximity of the 2 epitopes is consistent with finding that PVB28 and PVB124 cross-compete for binding to DSG3. however, the ability of PVB28, and not of PVB124, to cross-react with mouse DSG3 indicates that the 2 antibodies recognize overlapping but different epitope sera from 57 PV patients, 10 bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients and 32 healthy donors are shown. the inhibitory capacity of patient or control sera to inhibit binding of PVA224 to DSG3. four antibodies were produced recombinantly in the original VH/VL version (VHSM-VLGL), in a full germlined version (VHGL-VLGL), or a VH only or VL only germlined version (VHSM-VLGL), respectively. the antibodies were tested for staining of 293T cells transfected with DSG3 gene (A) and binding to DSG3-coated plates. peripheral blood samples were collected from 2 patients with mucocutaneous PV. one with long-lasting steroid-resistant disease (PVA) and the other prior to treatment initiation (PVB). cultures that produced specific antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution. the antibodies used different genes encoding the immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains. the antibodies carried heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (H-CDR3) and light chain complementarity-determining region 3 (L-CDR3) of different lengths (10\u201321 and 8\u201311 amino acids, respectively), and had a variable load of somatic mutations. H-CDR3 sequences identified an aromatic cluster (YYYYF) at the tip of H-CDR3 of the PVA224 antibody. chimeric DSG2 molecules containing DSG3 subdomains mapped to different DSG3 subdomains. 7 out of 9 antibodies from patient PVB targeted the EC2 subdomain and 2 recognized the EC5 subdomain. in vitro and in vivo pathogenic activity of anti-DSG3 antibodies. incubation of confluent monolayer of human keratinocytes with pathogenic antibodies resulted in the fragmentation of the keratinocyte sheet. antibodies PVA224 and PVB28 crossreact with mouse DSG3. they induced macroscopic blisters, intraepidermal suprabasal blistering and acantholysis, and intercellular deposition of human IgG in the epidermis. pathogenic antibodies bind to either EC1 or EC2 subdomains. 2 EC2-specific pathogenic antibodies PVB28 and PVB124 cross-competed for binding to DSG3. the EC1-specific antibody PVA224 was found to recognize a peptide from the linear library (KITYRISGVGIDQPP) and a conformation-dependent peptide from the double CLIPS library (RALNAQGLDVEKPLI) peptides recognized by PVA224 on the structure of C-cadherin ectodomain. EC1, EC2, and EC3 subdomains are highlighted with red, blue, and orange boxes. cis-adhesive interface is indicated by gray double arrows. the proximity of the 2 epitopes is consistent with finding that PVB28 and PVB124 cross-compete for binding to DSG3. however, the ability of PVB28, and not of PVB124, to cross-react with mouse DSG3 indicates that the 2 antibodies recognize overlapping but different epitopes. the PVA224 site on DSG3 EC1 is an immunodominant target for pathogenic autoantibodies in PV patients. the inhibitory capacity of 10 PV and 2 control sera on binding of human (PVA224, PVB124, and PVB28) and mouse (AK23) pathogenic antibodies to DSG3 are shown. we produced recombinant antibodies in which we removed all somatic mutations in the VH and VL genes of 3 pathogenic antibodies (PVA224, PVB28, and PVB124) and 1 nonpathogenic antibody (PVB16) we measured the capacity of these \u201cgermlined\u201d antibodies to bind to DSG3 when tested by ELISA or IF on DSG3 transfectants or human skin. antibodies target EC1 and EC2 subdomains of DSG3 in cis-adhesive interactions. previous studies in a mouse model of PV led to isolation and characterization of a mouse pathogenic antibody, AK23, that binds to EC1 and disrupts the DSG3-DSG3 trans-adhesive interaction. inocytes separate first in the interdesmosomal areas of early PV lesions, when desmosomes are intact and still adhere to each other. this is the first time in an organ-specific autoimmune disease that the germline version of the autoantibodies does not recognize the nominal autoantigen. the finding that germlined autoantibodies do not bind DSG3 suggests that this autoantigen does not represent the primary trigger of the pathogenic B cell clones. the germlined antibodies were not polyreactive, suggesting that their selection was not driven by heteroligation. we cannot rule out the possibility that the germlined antibodies might have an affinity for DSG3 sufficient to trigger naive B cells, but insufficient to be detected in classical binding assays. the patients showed typical clinical, histological, and immunopathological features. the patients showed high-titer anti-DSG circulating autoantibodies. cells were seeded at 2 104 cells/cm2 in flat-bottom 384- or 96-well plates. confluent monolayers were grown for an additional 16 hours in fresh medium supplemented with 1.2 mM CaCl2. IF staining was performed on cell monolayers in their culture plates. limiting antibody concentrations were incubated with an excess of baculovirus culture supernatant containing a single swapped molecule. to measure sensitivity to calcium depletion, wells coated with DSG3 were tested at a fixed dilution (1:25) for their capacity to inhibit binding of limiting amounts of biotinylated human antibodies. baculovirus culture supernatants containing specific domain-swapped baculoproteins (DSG3 EC1\u2013EC5/DSG2) and DSG2 and DSG3 as controls were incubated at RT for 1 hour with each antibody. the protein-antibody complex was incubated with protein A/G PLUS Agarose. uloprotein produced and affinity purified as previously reported. mAbs were affinity purified by protein A or protein G chromatography. mAbs were desalted against PBS. pepscan peptide-binding analysis was carried out by an ELISA-based format in which the colored substrate was quantified with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and an image-processing system. the values mostly ranged from 0 to 3,000, a log scale similar to 1 to 3 of a standard 96-well plate ELISA reader. the pathogenic activity of antibodies was evaluated by passive transfer in neonatal mice (4). human antibodies (300 g/mouse) were injected subcutaneously into the backs of neonatal C57BL/6NCrl mice together with 2 g ETA. Mice were sacrificed 18 to 24 hours after injection. culture supernatants tested for binding to keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) monolayers. positive cultures were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded. antibodies were purified using protein G columns. serial images of stained keratinocyte monolayers were acquired by the BD Pathway 855 automated fluorescence microscope. cryosections of skin of neonatal mice injected with pathogenic antibodies were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (DAKO) ELISA plates were coated with DSG1 and DSG3, blocked with 1% BSA. the capacity of mAbs to inhibit binding of polyclonal serum antibodies was measured by adding to DSG3 ELISA plates murinized PVA224 or AK23 antibodies first. the cut-off value was calculated as the mean of inhibition value of the 30 control (normal human serum [NHS]) and 10 sera from bullous pemphigoid patients plus 2 SDs. centrifuged IPs were applied to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) membranes were first incubated with the anti\u2013E-tag rabbit polyclonal antibody and then with a secondary AP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (SouthernBiotech) the filter was washed and stained with 330 mg/ml of nitroblue tetrazolium the use of VH and VL gene segments was determined by sequencing. the analysis for homology to known human V, D, and J genes was performed using the IMGT database. mAbs were added (1\u201310 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C overnight. cells were incubated with dispase I (Roche Diagnostics Corp) for 30 minutes to detach the monolayer from the plate. all patients gave informed consent."}
