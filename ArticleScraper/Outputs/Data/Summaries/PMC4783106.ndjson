{"summary": "systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014. results This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the predominant bacterial pathogens. recurrent OM occurs when a patient has 3 diagnosed AOM episodes within six months or more than 4 episodes in 12 months. despite this complexity, bacterial and viral pathogens are strongly associated with OM development. only 4% of children diagnosed with OM had no bacterial or viral pathogen detected using culture and PCR. monitoring both the identification and frequency of detection of common otopathogens in OM is central to evaluation of the effects of treatment and impact of vaccination programs. for example, pneumococcal carriage was reduced in association with the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in the us and has also increased prevention of early AOM infections. otitis media (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Canada, the us)) or (otitis media (Britain, Denmark, England, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, Wales, the UK) pre-determined inclusion selection criteria were used. only human studies (ii) age range one month\u201318 years (majority of reported study populations below 8 years old) otopathogenic bacteria were identified from MEF samples of children experiencing a range of presentations of OM. data tables within this narrative report were compiled from the primary results from each included report. analysis was not performed due to variation of the designs of the included studies and study population characteristics within the published reports. in five literature searches: Search 1\u2014Asian region: (otitis media (Asia (aetiology, otopathogens, pathogens, microbiology, bacteriology, bacteria)) or (otitis media (Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Korea, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paragu study selection and data extraction All articles in English were assessed for relevance by review of abstracts when available. pre-determined inclusion selection criteria were used: (i) only human studies (ii) age range one month\u201318 years (majority of reported study populations below 8 years old) otopathogenic bacteria were identified from MEF samples. the included studies were manually searched for additional relevant references. data items, synthesis and analysis Data illustrating the frequency of detection of predominant bacteria were collated and recorded. the antibiotic sensitivity of these bacteria and the vaccination status of the participants were recorded, where available. six articles met all the previously described criteria. the number of articles varied for each of the 5 regions. within the Americas, European and Asian regions, the reports analysed described 8 different countries within each region. the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis in these reports, identify them as the three predominant bacterial pathogens. other bacteria isolated from the MEF included: Streptococcus pyogenes or Group A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis detected from MEF of patients with AOM. countries/regions OM Agea Size Bacteriab Ref.

PCV7 serotypes are reported to cause more otalgia or ear ache than non-PCV7-serotypes. children with AOM caused by S. pneumoniae experience higher fever and redness of tympanic membrane than those with AOM caused by H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis. less than 50% of H. influenzae strains recovered from patients with OM were -lactamase producers. -lactamase is responsible for bacterial resistance to the -lactam antibiotics. BLNAR strains have been isolated from the MEF of patients with OM. the 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) contains 10 pneumococcal serotypes and protein D of H. influenzae. this vaccine is immunogenic against protein D and well tolerated in studies conducted in America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. more than 90% of strains isolated from patients with OM were -lactamase producers, although lower rates of 40%-50% have been reported from Turkey and Nigeria. development of a vaccine strategy for M. catarrhalis is at an early stage [150\u2013152] S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis dominate, geographical differences are emerging. differences relate to PCV use, antimicrobial treatment and potentially other local regional factors. this highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and reporting of the microbiology of OM globally. strategies for searching studies on pathogens of OM in the Americas.
