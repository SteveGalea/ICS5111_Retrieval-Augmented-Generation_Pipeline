{"summary": "the pathogen of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine, characterized by watery diarrhea, which results in high morbidity in pigs all of ages and mortality in piglets. since the first report in 1978 (13), there have been frequent outbreaks in many swine-raising countries, leading to severe economic losses in Asia, notably in China, Thailand, and Korea. two specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PEDV were developed and characterized. an antigen capture ELISA (AC-ELISA) method was established using one of the MAbs to detect PEDV in fecal samples. MAbs were isotyped using the mouse MAb isotyping kit (Sigma) the mice were handled and maintained under strict ethical conditions according to international recommendations for animal welfare. the mice were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assays according to previously described methods. ted for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with anti-HRP-labeled goat antimouse IgG (Zhongshan Company) diluted 1:2,000 and developed using a diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate buffer at room temperature until an amethyst-colored signal was observed. ELISA was used to determine its titer. the reaction was visualized by incubation with orthophenylenediamine (OPD) the optimal dilutions and cutoff values were calculated as described in a previous report (6). the positive\u2013negative threshold value was defined as mean (of 30 PEDV negative samples)3 standard deviations (SD) fugation at 2,000 g for 15 min was pelleted by 10% (w/v) PEG-6000 precipitation overnight at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 50,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. resulting pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.4) gradient was centrifuged for 2.5 h at 100,000 g and 4\u00b0C (1,7) the cells were then incubated with hybridoma conditioned supernatants and fluoresceine isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat antimouse IgG at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in succession. the membrane was sliced into strips and incubated with either the supernatant of the hybridoma culture or that of SP2/0 myeloma cell culture, at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. a system of double antibody sandwich ELISA test was optimized using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the PEDV S protein (9) and the mouse MAb as the capture and detector antibody. the wells were coated with 100 L of 25 to 1,600 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal antibodies and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. they were then washed with PBS Tween-20 (PBST) three times and blocked with 200 L/well of nonfat dry milk for 2 a system of double antibody sandwich ELISA test was optimized using purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the PEDV S protein (9) and the mouse MAb as the capture and detector antibody, respectively. the wells of the ELISA plates were coated with 100 L of 25 to 1,600 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. the reaction was visualized by incubation with orthophenylenediamine (OPD) the optimal dilutions and cutoff values were calculated as described in a previous report (6). the positive\u2013negative threshold value was defined as mean (of 30 PEDV negative samples)3 standard deviations (SD) two hybridoma cell lines, 5D7 and 3H4, were able to secrete stably MAbs specific only for PEDV. the titers of ascites fluid from 3H4 and 5D7 were 5105 and 1107, respectively. a negative signal for the presence of PEDV was observed with SP2/0 incubation. vero cells infected with PEDV showed strong green fluorescence in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. the noninfected cells interacted with two MAbs did not show any fluorescence. no fluorescence signals were detected on the mock-infected cells reacting with 3H4 (A) or 5D7 (B) the sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was determined to be 15.6 TCID50 (Table 1). TGEV, PPV, PRV, CSFV, and PEDV were tested by AC-ELISA. ation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient resulted in only one distinct virus band at the junction of the 50% and 65% sucrose gradient. the virus showed classical characteristics of a surface displayed petal-like structure approximately 100 nm in size, which is the spike protein of PEDV. two hybridoma cell lines, 5D7 and 3H4, were able to secrete stably MAbs specific only for PEDV. hybridoma 3H4 (A), 5D7 (B), or SP2/0 (C) myeloma cells were used as primary antibodies. distinct spots with (A) and (B) indicated a positive result. fuzzy spots with (C) and lack of a spot with Vero as the antigen indicated a negative result. titers of ascites fluid from 3H4 and 5D7 were 5105 and 1107. ascites fluid 5D7 was purified for use as a detector antibody in AC-ELISA. incubation with 3H4 and 5D7 hybridoma suspensions showed strong positive signals for PEDV. MAbs 3H4 (C) and 5D7 (D) recognized PEDV in the affected Vero cells. in contrast, no fluorescence signals were detected on the mock-infected cells reacting with 3H4 (A) or 5D7 (B) AC-ELISA Optimal antibody dilutions AC-ELISA by checkerboard titration was performed to select the optimal antibody dilution for test samples. sensitivity of antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was determined to be 15.6 TCID50. sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was determined to be 15.6 TCID50. AC-ELISA tested several kinds of virus related to diarrhea disease. TGEV, PPV, PRV, CSFV, and PEDV were tested by AC-ELISA. sensitivity of ELISA with conjugated MAbs was 15.6 TCID50 (TCID50=103.3/mL), which was same as that of RT-PCR. sensitivity of AC-ELISA was 15.6 TCID50 (TCID50=103.3/mL) the high fragility of coronaviruses in the contents of the intestines (2) has frequently been cited as an explanation of the lower sensitivity of ELISA in the clinical setting compared with RT-PCR. a sensitive and specific AC-ELISA system was established, which is suitable for screening large numbers of specimens."}
