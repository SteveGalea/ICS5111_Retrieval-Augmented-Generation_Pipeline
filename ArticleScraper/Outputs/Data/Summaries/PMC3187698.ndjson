{"summary": "single stranded (ss) DNA viruses are known to cause a variety of diseases in domesticated plants and animals. their genomes can be linear or circular, multi- or single component and are all smaller than 9 Kb in length. there are currently only seven recognized ssDNA virus families. some of the major ssDNA virus groups are evolutionarily related. the most obvious evolutionary links can be found amongst the circular eukaryote infecting ssDNA viruses that express a conserved replication associated protein (called Rep) and replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. branches with a posterior support probability 0.50 have been collapsed. some evidence exists that the Rep proteins of the geminiviruses, nanoviruses and circoviruses share distant evolutionary relationships with the NS1 proteins of linear animal infecting ssDNA viruses in the family Parvoviridae. oviruses may have arisen through recombination between a nanovirus and a ssRNA picorna-like virus [25] neither of these recombinant origin hypotheses are strongly supported by the available nucleotide sequence data. the geminivirus coat protein has a fold that is superficially similar to those of some ssRNA icosahedral viruses. recombination events have resulted in the generation of new genera, species and strains of geminiviruses [29\u201336], circoviruses [37\u201345], nanoviruses [40,46,47], anelloviruses [48\u201350] and parvoviruses [40,51\u201355]. the types of recombination that occur within these families include homologous recombination during which sequences within one genome are replaced with homologous sequence circular eukaryotic ssDNA replicons that express Rep homologues are likely to replicate via RCR. the linear genomes of parvoviruses are generally replicated by variants of a so-called \u201crolling hairpin replication\u201d mechanism [66\u201368]. unencapsidated parental virion strand is converted to double stranded DNA by host DNA polymerases. as replication proceeds the old virion strand is progressively displaced. the genome length virion strands produced by Step 6a and 7 can also be encapsidated. the variants of RHR that occur in linear parvoviral genomes typically involve the replication of both viral strands during the same continuous process. the replication complex switches from the parental strand to the identical sequence on the newly synthesized strand. new single stranded breaks introduced at the replication origins of these dsDNA molecules result in the formation of new replication forks that displace ssDNA strands that are ready for packaging. lindrome the replication complex switches strands and replication continues, producing a genome dimer (Steps 4 and 5) when it returns to the terminal B palindrome, the replication complex once again switches templates with replication continuing onwards to form a genomic tetramer (in dark orange and red) this double stranded form is then further processed to release genome length ssDNA molecules that are ready for packaging. infected with linear parvovirus genomes undergoing RHR numerous linear dsDNA viral genome concatomers will arise. when double stranded breaks occur within such molecules it is probable that they will induce generic host dsDNA break responses which will repair these molecules via homology dependent recombination mechanisms. the 3\u2032 ssDNA ends of broken molecules will prime the synthesis of a new DNA strands on the unbroken templates. ssDNA viruses replicated by either RCR or RHR, produce hDNA molecules containing multiple genome copies and multiple replication origins. these replicationally released genomes will contain one recombination breakpoint at the original site of strand breakage. in the circular ssDNA viruses, RCR can only commence following the conversion of ssDNA viral genomes into transcriptionally active circular dsDNA molecules by host DNA polymerases. dsDNA molecules cleaves the virion strand at the virion strand origin (v-ori) as new virion strands are synthesized, the old strands are progressively displaced. as replication proceeds the old virion strand is either released as a monomeric virus genome (Step 6a) single stranded genome monomers and dimers yielded by Step 6a and 7 can be converted to double stranded DNA by host DNA polymerases for additional rounds of replication. virion strands produced by Step 6a can also be encapsidated. new single stranded breaks introduced at the replication origins of these dsDNA molecules result in the formation of new replication forks that displace ssDNA strands ready for packaging. the linear unencapsidated parental parvovirus strand (in red) has a 3\u2032 OH (indicated by the arrowhead) and palindromic ends that form terminal hairpin secondary structures (labeled by the arrowhead) recombination occurs within ssDNA viruses by clashes between transcription and replication enzyme complexes or through single stranded breaks in the template strand of replicative form dsDNAs. if replication restarts following the reattachment of these complexes to template molecules other than those on which replication had initially started, the fully replicated genomes will be recombinants generated by a mechanism known as copy-choice. heterogeneous-length double stranded DNA (hDNA; [78] molecules that this process yields can comprise most of the viral DNA within infected cells. in these viruses it is apparent that such \u201crecombination dependent replication\u201d (RDR) is a major mechanism of genome replication. genomes consisting of up to eight circular ssDNAs each 1 Kb long [56,92\u201395], geminiviruses in the genus begomovirus can (but not always) have genomes consisting of two components each 2.7 Kb long. Begomoviruses are also frequently associated with small 12 or 14 genome length satellite molecules. in nanoviruses it is a \u201cmaster Rep\u201d expressed from the DNA-A component that trans-replicates the other genome components. common regions of a genome\u2019s various components contain repeated (or iterated) Rep specificity determinants that are specific for the Rep expressed by that genome\u2019s DNA-A (if it is a begomovirus) or DNA-R (if it is a nanovirus) geminiviral DNA-A and nanoviral DNA-R components maintain replication control over their dependent components. it is apparent that simply replacing the common region of a dependent component with that of a new master component will not always produce an optimally functioning multi-component virus. recombination between geminivirus DNA-A and its associated satellites occasionally yields satellite molecules that have the DNA-A common region. recombination event between a DNA-A and a DNA-beta-like molecule yielded a trans-replication, movement and encapsidation proficient genome component prototype. recombination event between a DNA-A and a DNA-beta-like molecule could recreate a DNA-B-like component is credible. super-small sub-genomics retaining only the sequence elements required for trans-replication could potentially be harnessed for use as gene expression vectors. the frequent occurrence of small 560 nt long molecules containing the ORF I gene may indicate some special role for this category of sub-genomic during the virus life-cycle. the significance of sub-genomic molecules in natural geminivirus infections remains unknown. the same sequence deletion process that creates sub-genomics results in the rapid reversion to wild-type size of genomic DNA molecules. this constraint is likely a strong size constraint on encapsidation. genetic material between ssDNA viruses and their hosts is known to occur in both directions. recombinational transfers of DNA from host genomes can occur. some variants of the human infecting parvovirus species, adeno-associated virus (aAV), frequently integrate at a specific site on chromosome 19 [163]. gene phylogeny reveals two previously unreported instances of geminivirus-like sequences within the genomes of the common apple and the dark cotton wood tree. rates of recombination and genome reassortment that occur between different viral species or strains will obviously be strongly influenced by the frequency with which viruses in these different lineages co-replicate within the nuclei of shared host species. ssDNA virus species have overlapping host ranges, tissue tropisms and epidemiological cycles. number of infected individuals will determine the frequency with which the viruses co-occur within the same infected nuclei. host range sizes of ssDNA viruses will determine how many opportunities they have to recombine with related species in the environment. the list of recognized brazilian tomato pathogens includes 15 geminivirus species. there is no definitive evidence that broadened host ranges have caused increased rates of recombination amongst the South American geminiviruses. some of these newly discovered tomato-infecting species are obvious recombinants. recombination experiments in geminiviruses and circoviruses have shown that this genome site is a mechanistically predisposed recombination hot-spot because of the replicational release of viral genomes from genomic concatomers. when these concatomers arise following a copy-choice mediated polymerase strand switch, or break and are rescued by host double stranded break repair pathways. recombinants that are replicationally released will the v-ori of most circular ssDNA viruses is both a recombination hot-spot and forms a stable hairpin structure. this is probably because they cause replication complexes to momentarily stall and, in so doing, increase the probability of strand transfers that can cause copy-choice type of recombination. this is probably because they cause replication complexes to momentarily stall. ssDNA viruses such as the geminiviruses and circoviruses have genes that are expressed from both the virion and complementary sense strands. it is perhaps significant that the complementary sense genes of these viruses are expressed in the opposite direction to RCR because whenever DNA replication proceeds in the opposite direction to gene transcription the opportunity exists for replication complex-transcription complex clashes. recombination hot-spots detectable within genomes of geminiviruses in the genus begomovirus co-localize very closely with genome sites that are exposed to host transcription and replication factors. v-oris are defined by a 10\u201330 nt long inverted repeat sequence capable of forming a hairpin structure that defines the actual v-ori. homologous recombination can be used to replicationally repair broken ss and dsDNA molecules. this is in fact what is observed during in vitro recombination experiments. in geminiviruses it has been found that recombination breakpoints can occur between two nucleotides that are non-identical in both parents. recombination breakpoints falling outside the v-ori hairpin tend to occur at sites where one parent sequence has a predicted secondary structure. recombination breakpoints falling outside the v-ori hairpin tend to occur at sites where one parent sequence has a predicted secondary structure but the other does not [194]. recombination breakpoints falling outside the v-ori hairpin tend to occur at sites where one parent sequence has a predicted secondary structure. highly homology dependent copy-choice recombination may be a particularly important mechanism of replication re-initiation following interruption due to transcription-replication complex clashes. this suggests that strongly homology dependent copy-choice recombination may be a particularly important mechanism of replication re-initiation following interruption due to transcription-replication complex clashes. recombination between more distantly related genomes could provide ssDNA viruses with far more adaptive options than are achievable through mutation alone. recombination between more distantly related genomes could also provide ssDNA viruses with far more adaptive options than are achievable through mutation alone. the adaptive potential of recombination has been definitively proven in the in vitro evolution under artificial selection of parvovirus-based gene delivery vectors. the parvovirus, AAV, could be particularly useful for the delivery of genes to treat hereditary heart muscle degenerative diseases. it has also been experimentally demonstrated in geminiviruses that recombination can be highly adaptive. two species, tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) frequently coexist within mixed tomato infections in these countries and yield a variety of recombinant forms. many recombinants are less infectious in tomato and replicate to lower titers than either TYLCV and TYLCSV in this host. recombinants of prokaryote infecting ssDNA microviruses appear to have experienced high rates of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution relative to its parental virus lineages. recombinants may be due at least in part to recombination frequently disrupting co-evolved intra-genome interactions. the average viability of such reciprocal recombinant pairs is almost invariably less than the average of their parents. the degree of disruption that recombination causes in long-range interactions depends on both the genome regions that are transferred and the degree to which the transferred sequences resemble those that they replace. recombinational transfers of less interactive genome regions are expected to incur lower fitness costs than transfers of more interactive regions. productive transfers of less interactive genome regions will occur only between distantly related viruses with high degrees of genetic compatibility in these regions. the constraints that mandatory maintenance of optimal long-range sequence specific interactions place on the viability of recombinants are so severe that patterns of recombination that arise during recombination can actually be used to trace these interactions. recombination breakpoints within coding regions tend to cluster on the edges of the genes where they are expected to have the lowest impact on intra-protein amino acid interactions. gene encoding highly oligomeric coat proteins of ssDNA viruses generally accumulate fewer recombination breakpoints than other viral genes. chimeric parvovirus coat proteins have clearly demonstrated that while recombination can seriously damage amino acid interactions necessary for proper capsid assembly, preservation of these interactions is the most the importance of genomic secondary structures at the replication origins of many ssDNA viruses is well established. in geminivirus recombination experiments, the inferred secondary structures of recombinant genomes that emerge during mixed infections are generally far less disrupted relative to parental genomes than are those of computationally generated recombinants. the average viability of such reciprocal recombinants is almost invariably less than the average of their parents. the degree of disruption that recombination causes in long-range interactions depends on both the genome regions that are transferred and the degree to which the transferred sequences resemble those that they replace. recombinational transfers of less interactive genome regions are expected to incur lower fitness costs than transfers of more interactive regions. begomoviruses TYLCV and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus have a significant tendency for genome regions that interact with one another to be inherited from the same parent. the subtle fitness difference between the recombinants is profound enough that given 50 unique recombinants arising during independent mixed infections of TYLCV and TLCCV it has proven possible to use pair-wise nucleotide association mapping to retrace every long-range intra-genome interaction. gene encodes protein that forms complex oligomers (for example, those forming viral capsids) recombination induced disruption of protein folding has in fact been directly detectable within replication associated protein and coat protein genes of recombinants. recombination can seriously damage amino acid interactions necessary for proper capsid assembly. recombinant ssDNA viruses have evolved to maximize the adaptive value of recombination and minimize its potentially deleterious effects. the central role of recombination throughout the evolutionary histories of the ssDNA viruses that replicate via RCR is probably reflected in the genomic positioning of their Rep genes and the genome sites that interact with Rep. differences between intra-population recombination rates of otherwise very similar virus populations would indicate differences in the rates at which viruses in the populations co-infect individual nuclei. recombination rate estimates could be used to differentiate between infection incidences, virus titers within infected individuals, and differences in infection durations. recombinants could include those that are more virulent, break inbred/genetically engineered resistance genes, are drug resistant and evade vaccine induced immune responses. evolution, dispersal, and population growth/decline rates of ssDNA viruses all occur within similar time-frames. phylogenetics based approaches could be used to pinpoint geographical locations where these events occurred."}
