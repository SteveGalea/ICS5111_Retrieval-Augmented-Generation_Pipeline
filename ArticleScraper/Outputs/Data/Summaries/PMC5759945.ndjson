{"summary": "leukemia cells are unable to undergo terminal differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis in response to appropriate environmental stimuli. 4 main types of leukemia have been determined, namely acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (CLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) the pharmacological and biological activities of extract of Toona sinensis (TS) have been reported, including anticancer,7,8 antioxidant,9 antiatherosclerotic/inflammatory,10 antidiabetic,11 antivirus,12,13. the phytochemical analyses of TS have isolated of triterpenes and phenolic compounds. RPMI-1640 medium was obtained from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA), anti-mouse Bax, anti-mouse -actin, anti-rabbit Bcl-2, anti-rabbit caspase-3, and anti-rabbit cytochrome c antibodies. cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- the yield of TS extracts was 5%.8 MTT Assay. 2 105 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates. the cells were incubated with or without various concentrations of TS (10-75 g/mL) for 24 hours. cells negative for both PI and Annexin V-FITC staining were considered normal live cells. PI-negative, Annexin V-FITC-positive stained cells were considered in early apoptosis. the proteins were transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidine fluoride) membranes overnight. the membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline. the membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody for 2 hours. blood was collected from animals at the end of the experiments for hematological analysis. blood samples (1 mL) were dissolved in PBS at 50 mg/kg every 2 days. control group received daily injection of vehicle only. cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. cultures were harvested and cell numbers enumerated by hemocytometer analysis of cell suspensions. culture supernatants were removed and resuspended in 400 L of isopropanol. the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the effect of TS on cell viability was assessed as the percent of viable cells compared to the vehicle-treated control group. FITC-positive stained cells were considered in late apoptosis. protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis WEHI-3 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish. the membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody for 2 hours. for densitometric analysis, band intensities were quantified using commercially available software (AlpaEaseFc 4.0; Genetic Technologies, Inc, Miami, FL, USA) liver and spleen samples were isolated and weighed for each animal. the tissues of liver and spleen were isolated and weighed for each animal. cell viability was determined before and after treatment with TS. culture supernatant was removed and resuspended with isopropanol. the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. for 24 hours significantly as well as dose-dependently increased the protein expression levels of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS significantly reduced the levels of procaspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. we investigated whether TS promoted cell death was due to induction of apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells. the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 was decreased and pro-apoptosis protein Bax was increased by TS treatment (10-75 g/mL) for 24 hours. these results indicate that TS may disturb the Bcl-2 and Bax protein ratio and induce apoptosis. effects of TS on morphology and weight of spleen in WEHI-3 bearing mice. TS-treated spleen tissues display increased megakaryocytes and decreased numbers of neoplastic cells. injected with WEHI-3 cells and treated with TS by oral administration for 3 weeks. animals were sacrificed for examinations of gross (A) and liver weights (B) the results shown are the mean SD of 6 assays. control 4.0 0.9 9.1 1.0 15.4 1.8 49.5 7.0 54.1 1.9 16.8 0.5 31.2 1.5 WEHI-3 30.6 27.1* 7.7 1.3 13.5 2.3 40.6 7.1* 53.3 3.8 17.7 1.4 33.5 4.2 WEHI-3+TS 12.2 1.9*# 8.2 0.9 13.9 1.4 46.0 4.8 56.0 1.4 16.9 0.4 30.2 0.6 Abbreviations: WBC, white blood cells; RBC, red blood treatment of TS with WEHI-3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of WEHI-3 cell proliferation with the IC50 value of 21.9 0.6 g/mL. this result suggests that TS was cytotoxic to murine WEHI-3 leukemia cells. cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TS (10-75 g/mL) for 24 hours. cell viability was determined before and after treatment with TS. TS induces apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells. cytochrome c is reportedly involved in the activation of the downstream caspases, which trigger apoptosis. treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS significantly reduced the levels of procaspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. cl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w investigated apoptosis related protein by Western blotting. the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 was decreased and pro-apoptosis protein Bax was increased by TS treatment (10-75 g/mL) for 24 hours. these results indicate that TS may disturb the Bcl-2 and Bax protein ratio and induce apoptosis. effects of TS on morphology and weight of spleen in WEHI-3 bearing mice. white arrow indicates liver and spleen. effects of TS on morphology and weight of liver in mice. TS-treated group showed a significant increase in white blood cell count compared with control group. TS-treated group increased the concentration of red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels.
