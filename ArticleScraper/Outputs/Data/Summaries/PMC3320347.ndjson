{"summary": "the study During the first Toronto SARS outbreak in March 2003, 69 healthcare workers at risk for SARS were interviewed a median of 1.2 months (range 4.8 to 5.3 months) after exposure (3). these workers were eligible for participation in this second investigation because they had entered the index patient's room from 24 hours before intubation to 4 hours after intubation. the second questionnaire contained a substantial number of questions that were identical to those in the first questionnaire. no.
