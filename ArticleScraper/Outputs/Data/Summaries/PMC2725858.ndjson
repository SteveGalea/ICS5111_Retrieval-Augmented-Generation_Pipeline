{"summary": "the method Our new system for rapid determination of viral RNA sequence (RDV) uses whole-genome amplification and direct sequencing techniques. the method comprises 6 procedures: 1) effective destruction of cellular RNA and DNA for semipurification of viral particles, 2) effective elimination of DNA fragments by using a prefiltration column system. a whole genome amplification system (WGA; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used to amplify viral double-stranded cDNA. the reaction mixture was heated at 95\u00b0C for 9 min, followed by 70 cycles of amplification using mastercycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) the adaptor sequence is underlined, and the HaeIII-digested sequence is shown in italics. we always used >12 primer sets and 0.83 mol of each primer per cDNA library. DNA was purified from the PCR by using MonoFas. the percentages of positive fragments were 60% (3/5), 45% (5/11), 100% (12/12), 50% (5/10) and 40% (4/10), respectively. a throat swab specimen from a patient with fever and upper respiratory infection exhibited enterovirus-like cytopathic effect."}
