{"summary": "interferon-inducible transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) is a protein that restricts multiple pathogenic viruses such as influenza virus. the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C is rare in Caucasian populations, but much more common in the Han Chinese population. in recent years, the crucial role of IFITM3 protein mostly has been studied in controlling influenza A virus infection. in humans, a rare single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 has been identified. the presence of IFITM3 on late endosome blocks cytosolic access of pH-dependent viruses such as influenza A. however, for pH-independent viruses such as HIV-1, IFITM3 appears to restrict viral cell entry at the cell periphery or early endosome. this raises the question: does the minor allele (of Caucasians) have the same effect on acute HIV-1 infection as it does on influenza virus. time to an estimated CD4+ lymphocyte count lower than 350 cells/l was within 1 year of seroconversion. initial and peak viremia levels were defined according to the dynamics of HIV-1 viremia in acute HIV-1-infected patients. peak viremia level refers to the highest viral load detected during the acute HIV-1 infection. .76 150.87 0.001 HIV-1 VL (log/ml) Initial VL N.A. 4.64 0.99 4.85 0.89 4.54 1.03 0.165 Peak VL N.A. 5.46 0.74 5.59 0.81 5.41 0.72 0.487 Set-point VL N.A. study population Every 2 months, 6000 volunteers from the PRIMO cohort in Beijing were checked for early signs of acute HIV-1 infection. 178 individuals were diagnosed with acute HIV-1 infection, and 196 volunteers, who were HIV-1-negative, were enrolled in the control group. initiation (CD4+ 350 cells/l) or time to an estimated CD4+ lymphocyte count lower than 350 cells/l was within 1 year of seroconversion. those who did not show a significant CD4+ T-cell decline were defined as nonprogressors. initial and peak viremia levels were defined according to the dynamics of HIV-1 viremia in acute HIV-1-infected patients. .77 515.76 150.87 0.001 HIV-1 VL (log/ml) Initial VL N.A. 4.64 0.99 4.85 0.89 4.54 1.03 0.165 Peak VL N.A. 5.46 0.74 5.59 0.81 5.41 0.72 0.487 Set-point VL N.A. rs12252 sequences was amplified, sequenced and analyzed as described previously. chi-square test used to compare values between IFITM3-TT and CT/CC groups. nonparametric t test was used when data were normally distributed. progressors showed to have a significantly higher viral load at set-point (4.61 0.68) compared to nonprogressors (4.02 0.89; P = 0.002; Table 2). Genotype HIV-1 () MSM (196) Acute HIV infection Total (178) Rapid progressors (74) CC 69 (35.20%) 57 (32.02%) 22 (29.73%) 35 (33.65%) CT 86 (43.88%) 89 (50%) 46 (62.16%) 43 a higher frequency than in HIV-1-negative individuals (79.08%, 155/196; P = 0.01). the genotype frequency of the nonprogressors was not significantly different from the HIV-1-negative group (P = 0.721) a log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test was performed to identify whether there is a difference in disease progression in individuals with CD4+ T-cell counts below 350. the result of this test verified that CC/CT genotype carriers are more likely to become rapid progressors. progressors showed to have a significantly higher viral load at set-point (4.61 0.68) compared to nonprogressors (4.02 0.89; P = 0.002; Table 2. Allele and genotype frequencies of IFITM3 rs12252 in Chinese population. the C alleleb at single-nucleotide polymorphism 12252 was associated with rapid progression. a significantly higher frequency of the CC/CT genotypes was found in rapid progressors (91.89%, 68/74), compared with nonprogressors (75%, 78/104; P = 0.004) both heterozygotes and homozygotes for C allele showed significantly lower CD4+ T-cell counts than homozygotes for the T allele, at the seroconversion time point (485.2 15.33 vs. 563.0 34.54; P = 0.0276), to the third (494.9 14.78 vs. 576.0 27.78; P = 0.0197), sixth (458.1 14.58 vs. 566.7 43.37; P = 0.0232 four different HIV-1 subtypes were identified among 125 acute HIV-1-infected patients in this cohort. their distribution was described: subtype B 34.4% (43/125), subtype BC 11.2% (14/125), subtype C 1.6% (2/125), and subtype AE 52.8% (66/125). a higher percentage of rapid progressors were CC/CT genotype carriers, regardless of the infecting HIV-1 subtype. it has been predicted that this mutation may result in expression of truncated IFITM3 which lacks the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus [8]. the existence of a truncated IFITM3 protein in cells with the SNP rs12252-C allele has not yet been shown. 01-008, 2013ZX10001004-001-002, 2012ZX10001003, 2012ZX10001006, and 2012ZX10004904-002-002; capital health development (2011-2018-06, 2011-1011-02); medical research council, UK; and Wellcome Trust, Institutional Strategic Support Fund.
