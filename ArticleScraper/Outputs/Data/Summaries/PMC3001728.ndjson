{"summary": "comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) nares compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) are for the patient less discomfort. the swab goes with a lower cost than does the NPA. the sampling frequency for detection of respiratory viruses in this patient category is expected to increase. both specimens were obtained without instillation of any solution into the nostrils. the fiber tip of the fNS was put in 500 L RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and shaken for 30 minutes. the PCR program included 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. 40 cycles consisting of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 60 sec at 60\u00b0C. the sensitivity of the assay was 3 copies per reaction. both specimens were obtained without instillation of any solution into the nostrils. the fiber tip of the fNS was put in 500 L RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and shaken for 30 minutes. the PCR program included 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles consisting of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 60 sec at 60\u00b0C. the sensitivity of the assay was 3 copies per reaction, as determined by repeated testing of in-house cloned plasmids. the patients were sampled within one day from admittance. in 32 (33%) and 9 (9%) of the cases, the samples were collected on the second and third day after admittance. 98 paired samples collected with fNS and fNS respectively were obtained. c Cohen's kappa: >0.8, almost perfect agreement; 0.6-0.8, substantial agreement; 0.4-0.6, moderate agreement; 0.4, poor agreement. the amount of cells yielded by NPA approximated by ACTB copy numbers was significantly larger than by fNS with a mean difference of 4.2 105 cells/mL. sensitivity increases when the nasopharynx is sampled instead of the nasal cavity. the difference in sensitivity for the fNS and NPA could have several reasons. a deeper penetration could cause even more discomfort than does the fNS. fNS sampling of the nares for viral detection in immunocompromised individuals cannot be recommended until further large studies have revealed promising results. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions All authors have been active in the interpretation of data, the writing of the manuscript and the process of its internal revision. grants received from the Stockholm City Council/Karolinska Institutet and from the Swedish Children's Cancer Foundation."}
