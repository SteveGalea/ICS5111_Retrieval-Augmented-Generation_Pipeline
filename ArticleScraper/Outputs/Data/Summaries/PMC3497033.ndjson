EBOV infection by itself caused increased accumulation of cells in G1 phase, although this effect was found to be cell type dependent. results and Discussion 2.1. Image Based quantitative analysis to determine cell cycle phase. the cells that were not labelled by EdU or pH3 should be in G0/G1 (2N DNA) and G2 (4N DNA) phase. results suggest that if the NINI values for a population of cells treated with compound or siRNA differ significantly from the untreated controls, then it may reflect major changes in cell cycle events. NINI values are calculated by measuring the integrated nuclear intensity divided by the number of nuclei within each well. NINI values for S phase (EdU marked nuclei) range between 0.5 and 1X NINI values of pH3. serum starved cells showed much reduced percentage of EBOV infected cells compared to cells incubated with complete medium. cells were serum starved for 24 h and then infected with different MOI of EBOV. after 1 h virus was removed and cells were incubated for 24 h. image analysis showed reduced EBOV infection in serum starved cells. after 24 h, cells were fixed, stained with anti-GP antibody (6D8) and Hoechst 33342 dye. a time-dependent increase in the EBOV infection (B) and increase in NINI values based on Hoechst 33342 dye (C) was observed. a dose-dependent decrease in percentage of EBOV infected cells was observed. treatment of HeLa cells with different concentrations of nocodazole showed a dose-dependent reduction in EBOV infection. EBOV infection is favored in actively proliferating cells. nocodazole restricts EBOV infection. a dose dependent decrease in virus infection was observed. at 48 h, there was an increase in cell death with increasing MOI of the virus. cell cycle analysis of EBOV infected A549 cells also did not display cell cycle defects. the observed difference in EBOV mediated cell cycle modulation between HeLa and MCF10A cells could be due to the nature of cell type. nuclei that were not labelled with EdU or pH3 could be cells in G1 or G2 phase. the cells that were not labelled by EdU or pH3 should be in G0/G1 (2N DNA) and G2 (4N DNA) phase. the compound aphidicolin is known to inhibit DNA polymerase. aphidicolin can effectively block cells from DNA replication. the NINI values were similar to the untreated control cells. cells were treated with indicated concentrations of nocodazole (C) or aphidicolin (D) for 12 h. a dose-dependent increase in NINI values corresponds to a block in G2/M phase. high aphidicolin concentrations (3 and 30 M) results in NINI values that correspond to G1 phase. the results suggest that EBOV cannot infect efficiently in cells blocked in G1 phase of the cell cycle. however, if cells are released from the growth arrest by addition of medium containing serum, and infected 3 h or 6 h after the release, a timedependant increase in EBOV infection (Figure 2B) and corresponding increase in NINI values (Figure 2C) was observed. this study further confirm that EBOV requires actively dividing cells for efficient infection. a dose dependent decrease in percentage of EBOV infected cells is observed. the efficiency of EBOV infection was then studied in cells released from the aphidicolin mediated cell cycle arrest. treatment of HeLa cells with different concentrations of nocodazole showed a dose-dependent reduction in EBOV infection. similar results were observed in nocodazole treated A549 and MCF-10A cells. both A549 and MCF-10A cells showed reduced infection with increasing concentrations of nocodazole. removal of nocodazole block did not restore the EBOV infection. plated in 10 cm dishes were infected with EBOV at 0, 2.5, 5 or 10 MOI for 24 h (A) and then subjected to flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis. cells were seeded at 1 106 cells per 10 cm tissue culture treated plates. cells were either left untreated or incubated. cells were washed with regular medium containing serum and incubated in complete medium for the time points indicated in the experiments. for all experiments, cells were incubated with the appropriate concentrations of the inhibitors for 12 h. dye Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1 mg/mL diluted in PBS) all labeling experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least two independent times. emission light was split by a 580-nm SP dichroic mirror and collected on separate cameras through 562/40-nm and 690/70-nm band-pass filters. the second exposure used the 405-nm and 561-nm lasers to excite the nuclear and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 respectively. image analysis images were analyzed within the Opera environment using standard Acapella scripts. cells were seeded in 96 well imaging plate (15,000 cells/well) cells were either left untreated or washed and incubated with serum free medium for 24 h. for the release experiments, compound treated cells were washed and replaced with complete medium. the cells were stained for 1 h at RT with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 secondary antibody. all labeling experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least two independent times. images were acquired as 2 exposures using a 10 air objective and a bin fac\u00adtor of 1. The first exposure used the 488-nm and 640-nm lasers to excite the viral and cell body fluorophores. the second exposure used the 405-nm and 561-nm lasers to excite the nuclear and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 respectively. all samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 0.5mg/mL RNAse A (Qiagen) for 1 h. samples were acquired on a Beckman Coulter Gallios with a stopping gate of 100,000 total events and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). the development of an HCI assay to quantitate different phases of cell cycle. release of cell cycle block induced by serum starvation or aphidicolin resulted in time-dependent increase of EBOV infection. there is also possibility that other cellular pathways such as mTOR and autophagy that are activated upon serum starvation may potentially modulate EBOV infection."}
