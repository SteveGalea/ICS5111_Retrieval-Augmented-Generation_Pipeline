{"summary": "positive-sense RNA (+RNA) viruses including the Flaviviruses, enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family, Alphaviruses, and Coronaviruses dramatically modify cellular membranes. biogenesis of these replication compartments is a complex interplay of interactions between virus and host proteins. some of the shared pathways highlighted in this review include lipid metabolism, autophagy, signal transduction and proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. Flaviviridae The Flaviviridae family includes many significant global pathogens including Hepatitis C virus. the flaviviridae family includes many significant global pathogens including Hepatitis C virus. the Hepacivirus genus contains HCV, a prominent blood-borne human pathogen that causes chronic hepatitis. the virions are enveloped and contain a single copy of viral genomic RNA encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. the biogenesis of the HCV VRCs and the stabilization of these structures have been extensively studied. the membrane-associated non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) plays a key role in the formation of this network [5], which consists of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) protruding out of ER. a plethora of host factors involved in lipid metabolism, intracellular signalling, protein folding, and vesicular trafficking are known to VPs are the sites of viral replication as evidenced by the fact that they contain double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a replication intermediate, and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5. CMs and PCs in WNVKUN-infected cells are 85 nm in diameter indicating the conserved nature of these structures. these \u201cvesicles\u201d appear to be invaginations of the ER membrane with small neck-like openings (11.2 nm for DENV) the ER localized non-structural viral proteins, WNVNY99 NS4B [20] and DENV-2 NS4A [22] play a role in the initial membrane curvature. a large number of host proteins involved in flavivirus replication have been identified by proteomic and transcriptomic studies of infected cells [26,27,28], mapping the host cell interactome of viral proteins [29,30,31] and through systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screens [32,33] common host pathways that affect virus replication include those involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and cell structure. the requirement for autophagy in flavivirus VRCs varies significantly. this is in contrast with DENV and JEV, which both exploit autophagy for virus propagation. viral protein NS4A upregulates the formation of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. newly synthesized fatty acids are incorporated into DENV VRCs. pharmacological inhibition of FAS by cerulenin or C75 negatively affects DENV replication in mammalian. tase (HMGCR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in synthesis of mevalonate. LDLR is a cell surface receptor that binds and internalizes cholesterol-containing complexes. this may indicate HMGCR aids VRC formation by producing cholesterol at these sites. changes to the cellular structural framework could aid in biogenesis and/or stabilization of newly formed VRCs. NS4A interactions with vimentin may be the link between intermediate filaments and VRCs. destabilizing protein Stathmin 1 is another host factor linked to biogenesis of VRCs. cular trafficking are known to be important for HCV VRC activity. we refer readers to following recent reviews. most have focused on DENV and WNV. the origins of these membranes vary between viruses. the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment marker ERGIC53 is associated with CMs and PCs. the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment marker is associated with CMs and PCs. ural viral proteins, WNVNY99 NS4B [20] and DENV-2 NS4A [22] are thought to play a role in the initial membrane curvature. ural viral proteins, WNVNY99 NS4B and deNV-2 NS4A [22] are thought to play a role in the initial membrane curvature. a large number of host proteins involved in flavivirus replication have been identified by proteomic and transcriptomic studies of infected cells [26,27,28], mapping the host cell interactome of viral proteins [29,30,31]. common host pathways that affect flavivirus replication include those involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and cell structure. HCV and members of the Picornaviridae family are known to recruit PI4Ks to their VRC networks for the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol to Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids. neither WNV nor DENV seem to require PI4P lipids. glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) in flavivirus replication are less clear. levels of cholesterol also modulates curvature and plasticity of membranes. a process controlled by ER-localized transcription factor sensors. cholesterol seems to be a key lipid component of the flavivirus VRC. however, inhibition of HMG-CoA reduced replication of DENV replicons. another host factor involved in cholesterol biosynthesis was shown to be important for DENV replication. DENV infection upregulates STMN1 by reducing levels of miR-223, a microRNA that normally targets the mRNA for STMN1. poliovirus crippled hundreds of thousands of people per year, primarily children. membrane-enclosed bodies were observed in the perinuclear zone. nascent VRCs were not observed but formed later during RNA replication. early in infection, 100\u2013200 nm single membrane tubular structures formed through a membrane wrapping process. autophagy induces autophagy in a mouse model in vivo. despite this evidence, the role of autophagy remains controversial. PV vesicles that stained for dsRNA did not colocalize with LC3 early (3 hpi) in infection. PV infection is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that inhibits activation of ADP-ribosylating factor GTPases (Arfs), which are necessary for formation of COPI vesicles [73,74]. attenuation of COPII vesicle formation did not interfere with PV infection suggesting that this budding mechanism is not absolutely required [72] arf activation may induce vesicle formation and VRC biogenesis. PV 3A binds GBF1 and recruits it to virus-induced vesicles. this may result in formation of defective VRCs or mislocalization of contents. picornaviruses induce protrusion of cellular membranes to form convoluted tubular-like structures. early evidence of altered lipid metabolism came from the observation that PV increases PtdCho levels in the cells by upregulating the rate-limiting enzyme phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. replication suggests that FAS gene transcription and translation may be upregulated following signalling cascades induced by CVB3 virions binding. fatty acids are trafficked and stored in lipid droplets, but in infected cells they colocalize with VRCs. PI4KIII colocalizes with Arf1 at replication complexes during CVB3 infection. recruitment of PI4KIII to arf1-positive membranes can be stimulated by expression of CVB3 3A alone. recruitment of PI4KIII to the VRC seems conserved among enteroviruses. rin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for PV and CVB3 replication. cholesterol is targeted to recycling endosomes, which fuse with existing VRCs. rin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for PV and CVB3 replication. PV vesicles that stained for dsRNA did not colocalize with autophagic marker LC3 early (3 hpi) in infection. but at 5 hpi LC3 was detected by immuno-electron microscopy in association with dsRNA. PV proteins 2B and its precursor 2BC colocalize with the COPII component Sec31 [68] and PV infection enhances COPII vesicle budding. PV infection is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits activation of ADP-ribosylating factor GTPases (Arfs) expression of PV 3A or 3CD promotes the association of Arf3 and Arf5 with membranes where viral RNA replication occurs. -COP, a COPI component, does not colocalize with dsRNA during PV infection. this association can be blocked by BFA. recruitment of arf1/GBF1 to VRCs appears to differ among enteroviruses. expression of CVB3 3A induces recruitment of GBF1 to membranes. homologous proteins of HRV-2 or -14 do not. FAS protein production is upregulated as early as one hour post CVB3 infection and does not require viral replication. fatty acids are trafficked and stored in lipid droplets, but in infected cells they colocalize with VRCs. modifying enzymes including (PI4Ks) are downstream effectors of Arf. enviroxime exhibits potent antiviral activity against enteroviruses in vitro. other PI4KIII inhibitors, including GW5074 and BF738735, also efficiently inhibit enteroviral replication in vitro and in vivo in mice. PI4P and cholesterol are enriched at VRCs of CVB3, PV, and HRV-2. cholesterol is shuttled from endosome to the VRC where it colocalizes with CVB3 3A. clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for PV and CVB3 replication. the ORF1 encodes the replicase required for transcription of the full-length (genomic) minus-strand template and subgenomic (discontinuous transcription) minus-strand synthesis. the predicted multi-spanning membrane proteins nsp3 [100], nsp4 [101] and nsp6 [102] are believed to be involved in biogenesis and stability of the coronavirus replication/transcription complex. the outer membranes of DMVs are thought to fuse together and transition into vesicle packets (VPs) late in infection, CMs become concentrated in the perinuclear area and CMs of 0.2 to 2 m in diameter form in close proximity to the DMV clusters. this suggests that both membranes of CoV DMVs are sealed raising the question of how the import of metabolites and export of viral RNA occurs from these structures. the question remains as to whether coVs make use of transport molecules as a means to regulate transport of products in and out of DMVs. similarities between co-localization between specific coV replicase proteins (nsp8, nsp2, nsp3) with microtubule-associated protein Light chain 3 (LC3) are consistent with autophagy playing a role in DMV formation. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) vesicle markers ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like 1 (EDEM1), Osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS-9) in embryonic fibroblasts. down-regulation of LC3 inhibits MHV replication and virion production. knocking out autophagy has no effect. EDEMosome cargo proteins EDEM1 and OS-9 associate with coV replicative structures. many protein trafficking and membrane fusion proteins that function downstream of the ER in the early secretory pathway have not been detected at the RVN. the involvement of the COPI complex was investigated using the drug BFA. electron microscopy studies revealed that similar membrane formations occur in MERS-CoV-infected cells. the outer membranes of DMVs are thought to fuse together and transition into vesicle packets (VPs) late in infection, CMs become concentrated in the perinuclear area and CMs of 0.2 to 2 m in diameter form. nsp8, nsp2, nsp3, nsp3, light chain 3 (LC3), a protein marker for autophagic vacuoles, are consistent with autophagy playing a role in DMV formation. a lack of co-localization between specific coV replicase proteins (nsp8, nsp2, nsp3) and ER-associated degradation vesicle markers ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase- down-regulation of LC3 inhibits MHV replication and virion production. knocking out autophagy has no effect on non-structural protein production. results suggest that LC3 and the ERAD pathway are necessary for DMV formation. the involvement of the COPI complex was investigated using the drug BFA. the drug blocks COPI-mediated vesicular transport at the ER-Golgi interface. other positive RNA viruses discussed above require the COPI-mediated vesicular transport for replication. togavirus replication complexes originate from late endosomes and lysosomes. most host factors that interact with alphavirus replication complexes were identified through pull down assays with alphavirus non-structural proteins. this section focused on host factors partners that have been speculated or clearly demonstrated to play functional roles in RC biogenesis or function. the endosomal origin of CPVs is confirmed by the observation that these structures are often positive for both endosomal and lysosomal markers. as infection progresses, the non-structural polyprotein precursors are further processed to yield individual non-structural proteins. the fully processed non-structural proteins together form the mature replicase [115,133,134]. alphavirus virions produced in NPAFs were 26 times more infectious than those produced in normal human fibroblasts. this suggests that cellular production of less infectious virus may be a consequence of host restriction on virus replication. however, it does appear that cytoskeletal elements are involved. some of the many functions of Hsc70 are to target proteins for degradation, regulate the translocation of proteins into different cellular organelles such as ER and mitochondria. some of the many functions of Hsc70 are to target proteins for degradation, regulate the translocation of proteins into different cellular organelles such as ER and mitochondria, and regulate apoptosis. k et al. used small dextran-covered beads that incorporated into CPV-1 structures in infected cells. this allowed the isolation of membranous vesicles in SFV infected cells. however, it was not possible to determine when these host proteins were recruited. stress granules have been implicated in the antiviral response [150] and have been reported to form late during alphavirus infection, a process that correlates with host translational shutdown [151] nsp-G3BP association seems likely that nsPs associate with G3BPs as a means to inhibit their formation. the endosomal origin of CPVs is confirmed by the observation that these structures are often positive for both endosomal and lysosomal markers. as infection progresses, the non-structural polyprotein precursors are further processed to yield individual non-structural proteins. the fully processed non-structural proteins together form the mature replicase [115,133,134], which is required for efficient synthesis of positive-sense genomic and subgenomic RNA. the authors suggest that biogenesis of replication complexes are negatively affected due to the build-up of cholesterol and sphingolipids. the alphavirus virions produced in NPAFs were 26 times more infectious than those produced in normal human fibroblasts. this suggests that cellular production of less infectious virus may be a consequence of host restriction on virus replication. the re-localization of amphiphysins to alphavirus RCs promotes replication. recent data suggest a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases in alphavirus RC formation. this study confirmed the enrichment of G3BP1 and G3BP2 in CPV-1 vesicles in SFV infected cells. it was not possible to determine when these host proteins were recruited. nsP3-containing complexes were isolated from mosquito cells infected with SINV. stress granules have been implicated in the antiviral response [150] and have been reported to form late during alphavirus infection, a process that correlates with host translational shutdown [151] nsPs associate with G3BPs as a means to inhibit their formation."}
