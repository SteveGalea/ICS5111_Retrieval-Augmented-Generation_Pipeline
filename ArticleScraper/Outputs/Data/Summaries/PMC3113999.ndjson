{"summary": "the case report is usually a short article describing \"an interesting case\" in medicine. this might be a new medical condition, a new diagnostic approach, a new treatment or a new disease. a good example is the description of a condition that is believed to be \"malaria\" in the papyrus. the first case report on swine flu by Grasselli et al. [6] promoted generalized awareness of swine flu in Italy. another similar scenario is the report on the outbreak of bird flu, another problematic atypical infection. the case report can contribute to better understanding of a new and emerging infectious disease through a case series review."}
