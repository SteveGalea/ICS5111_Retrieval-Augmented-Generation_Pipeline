{"summary": "antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in vero cell was evaluated. anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. there was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin. other bioflavonoids, including quercetin and fisetin, showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication. flavonoids could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication. flavonoids are basically low molecular weight phenolic compounds found widely in different kinds of plants. different types of flavonoids can be found in fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, bark, steams and flowers of plants. antiviral activities of other flavonoids have also been reported against some viruses including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HSV-1, HSV-2 and some types of human adenoviruses. there is no published data on the possible anti-dengue virus activities of quercetin, hesperetin, naringin and daidzein. the effects of each compound were evaluated against different stages of dengue virus replication including virus adsorption and intracellular replication. in vitro cytotoxicity assay MTT assay was performed following manufacturer's instructions. confluent Vero cells in 96-well cell culture microplates were treated with different concentrations of each compound in triplicate. the treated cells were incubated for four days at 37 C followed by the addition of 15 l of MTT solution. the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unabsorbed viruses. after 1 h adsorption, the cells were infected with 200 FFU of DENV-2. the microplate was kept at 37 C for 1 h for virus adsorption and incubated at 37 C for 4 days. the percentage of viral foci reduction (RF %) compared with controls was calculated as follows: RF (%) = (C-T) 100/C. where, C is the mean of the number of foci for negative control well (without compound). a standard curve was established with a serially diluted RNA extracted from DENV-2 stock with known titer. for absolute quantitation of the viral RNA, a standard curve was established with a serially diluted RNA extracted from DENV-2 stock with known titer. confluent Vero cells in 96-well cell culture microplates were treated with different concentrations of each compound in triplicate. the microplate was incubated at 37 C for 4 h and 100 l of the solubilisation/stopping solution was added to each well. antiviral activity of compounds against intracellular replication of DENV-2 was performed by inoculation of 200 FFU of virus to each well in triplicate. different concentrations of each compound were added to the cells, followed by 4 days of incubation at 37 C. in another experiment, vero cells at 80% confluency were infected with 200 FFU of DENV-2 in the presence or absence of different concentrations of each compound. the numbers of DENV-2 foci were counted using a stereomicroscope. the titer of virus was expressed as Foci-Forming-Unit (FFU) the percentage of viral foci reduction (RF %) compared with controls was calculated as follows. a standard curve was established with a serially diluted RNA extracted from DENV-2 stock with known titer. hesperetin with CC50 = 110.3 0.32 g mL-1 is the most cytotoxic compound for Vero cells compared to the other tested compounds. 1% DMSO did not show any cytotoxicity against Vero cells. CC50 of bioflavonoids was calculated using Graph Pad Prism version 5. the levels of DENV-2 RNA production in the presence of 50 g mL-1 of daidzein decreased by only 25.3% 0.7 when compared to the non-treated infected cells. daidzein and hesperetin did not exhibit any anti-dengue activity when they were used after adsorption of deNV-2 to the vero cells. cells were treated continuously from 5 h before virus infection. no significant antiviral activity for naringin and hesperetin was observed. naringin exhibited anti-adsorption activity when it was added to cells. data from triplicate experiments were plotted using Graph Pad Prism Version 5 (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) the majority of the viral foci in cells treated with 50 g/ml quercetin appeared smaller, less intensely stained and more diffused within the focus. this observation is consistent with the reduction of the percentage of foci and RNA copy number. naringin with CC50 = 230.3 0.19 g mL-1 showed the least cytotoxic effects against Vero cells. cells treated with vehicle control, 1% DMSO did not show any cytotoxicity against Vero cells. daidzein showed very weak anti-dengue activity with IC50 = 142.6 g mL-1. levels of DENV-2 RNA production in the presence of 50 g mL-1 decreased by only 25.3% 0.7 when compared to the non-treated cells. the IC50 value for naringin was 168.2 g mL-1 and its related SI was 1.3. there was a reduction of 25.8% 0.76 in DENV-2 RNA production in the presence of 50 g mL-1 of naringin. flavonoids were added directly to virus inocula for 2 h at 37 C. reduction in foci forming unit was calculated relative to controls maintained in parallel (a) and respective DENV-2 RNA copy numbers were quantified using qRT-PCR (b). the majority of the viral foci in cells treated with 50 g/ml quercetin appeared smaller, less intensely stained and more diffuse within the focus. flavonoids such as glabranine and 7-O-Methyle glabranine exhibited significant antiviral activities against dengue virus. in vitro treatment of infected cells with these flavonoids resulted in the reduction of intracellular replication of dengue virus by 76.9% and 75%. other synthetic flavonoid derivatives also showed antiviral activity in HepG2 cells. the main anti-dengue activity of quercetin is likely due to its activity against the different stages of intracellular replication of DENV-2 instead of early stages of its replication cycle. a weak effect for prophylactic activity of quercetin however, was also observed. aringin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against another RNA virus, sindbis virus. the flavonoid may not be a good candidate for further development as anti-dengue drug. daidzein activity against deNV-2 was not significant compared to quercetin. naringenin, daidzein, an isoflavone also had no significant inhibition properties. flavonol could be the basic molecule that possesses anti DENV replication properties, but specific structural properties of the different flavonol derivatives would have different effects on the efficacy of the compounds. quercetin affects intracellular DENV virus replication but not the DENV attachment and entry processes. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
