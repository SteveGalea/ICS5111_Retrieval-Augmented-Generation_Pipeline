{"summary": "influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses are the cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, with children under 5 years of age and the elderly disproportionately burdened. a better understanding of the epidemiology of these pathogens is useful for the prevention and control of future epidemics. despite this apparent interference, viral co-infections do occur. despite this apparent interference, viral co-infections do occur. rhinovirus continues to be shed for several weeks post-resolution of symptoms. data from outbreaks, research and non-Victorian residents were excluded (n = 10 325) as they followed different sampling methods. Specimens collected from the same patient within 14 days were considered part of the same infection. when both specimens were positive for the same virus or both were negative, only the positive result was retained. the significance level for all tests was set at P 0.05. 58 114 clinical specimens were collected from communities and hospitals. the majority were nose/throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates. data from 2009 (n = 4232) were excluded as the influenza pandemic led to changes in referral and testing practices. the introduction of in-house testing at some referring hospitals led to a substantial decrease in samples tested by VIDRL. Picornavirus (rhinovirus) was detected most frequently (n = 5363, 33.1% of the positive specimens), followed by influenza A (n = 2259, 20.3%) and RSV (n = 1487, 13.3%). the proportion of tests positive for most viruses remained relatively stable (Fig. 1). 179 (7.9) 36 (6.8) 10 (55.6) 1651 (30.8) 363 (57.1) 249 (31.2) 67 (14.7) 51 (14.7) 5-19 1643 (4.9) 629 (5.6) 31 (2.1) 189 (8.4) 84 (15.8)

each virus is taken as a proportion of positive tests. the percentage for each virus is taken as a proportion of positive tests. more specimens tested were collected from males (53.9%). females were more likely to test positive for influenza A (P 0.001) and metapneumovirus (P = 0.015) males were more likely to test positive for picornavirus (P = 0.003) children under 5 years had the highest burden of influenza types A and B. those aged 5\u201319 years had the highest burden of metapneumovirus. median age of patients from whom specimens were collected increased fairly steadily from 27.6 years in 2002 to 61 years in 2015. a seasonal epidemic of RSV occurred 6 weeks earlier than that of influenza A. there were 3 years where the epidemics occurred at similar times. the lag calculated for influenza A overall was consistently similar to that of the predominant influenza A subtype in a given season. the highest quartile were considered late or large. those in the lowest quartile were considered early or small. a season with a high magnitude of infections with one virus did not necessarily result in a season with a low magnitude of the other. these three viruses were involved in the highest number of significant negative associations (n = 5, Table 3). no positive associations between viruses were considered statistically significant. significant negative associations were observed for co-detection with all viruses where influenza A was detected. 0.053 0.001 0.146 a 0.14 (0.02\u20131.03) 0.25 (0.12\u20130.50) 0.55 (0.25\u20131.23) Influenza C 0.733 0.539 0.898 0.387

coronavirus and parainfluenza virus. picornavirus was observed to be endemic throughout the period of analysis. we found co-detections of respiratory viruses in 6.4% of positive specimens. this falls in the 5.0\u201362.0% range of previous studies. adenovirus and coronavirus most likely to be part of a co-infection and influenza A and B least likely. infection by rhinovirus may result in temporary immunity of the host to infection by other respiratory viruses due to the production of cytokines. it is believed to be the driver of epidemiological interaction between respiratory viruses at the population level, which is visible when two viruses may not reach their epidemic peak during the same period. studies have noted variances in the timing of epidemics caused by different types of parainfluenza virus [4, 6] and rhinovirus [21] and there is scant information available for RSV."}
