{"summary": "the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis is a well-recognized, natural sweetener. it is used as a traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of various pathological conditions, including allergies, liver disease, gastric ulcers, and adrenal insufficiency. licorice root contains triterpene saponins, flavonoids, polysaccharides and other substances. macrophage phenotypes are often referred to as classically activated macrophages (or M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (or M2). the phenotype is polarized by Th1 cytokines such as IFN- and is characterized by high capacity to present antigen, high levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-12, IL-6) secretion and increased levels of NO production. FITC-dextran (40,000 Da) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) there was no detectable endotoxin (0.10 endotoxin units/mL) in the GA samples. anti-mouse antibodies FITC-F4/80, -CD80, -CD86, -MR and PE-MHCII. animals C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Slac Animal Inc. (Shanghai, China) and reared in Experimental Animal Center of Zhejiang University. all experimental protocols for animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University. h after treatment with PBS (Blank control), GA (100 g/mL), IFN- (15 ng/mL) + LPS (15 ng/mL) (M1-positive control) LDH activity in the culture supernatant was measured as previously described. cells from different treatment groups were collected and stained with antibodies against CCR7, MR, CD80, CD86, and MHCII. iNOS forward 5\u2032-GACGCTCTAAGTGCCATCTC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-ATAACTCTGTGCCCTTGATTCC-3\u2032; iNOS forward 5\u2032-CTCACCTACTTCCTGGAC-3\u2032; iNOS forward 5\u2032-CTCACCTACTTCCTGGAC-3\u2032; iNOS forward 5\u2032-CTCACCTACTTCCTGGAC-3\u2032; iNOS forward 5\u2032-CTCACCTACTTCCT BMDMs were pretreated with GA (100 g/mL) for 12 h. then incubated with FITC-dextran (1 mg/mL) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. blots were then developed with an ECL detection system. cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and incubated for 0 h or 24 h in DMEM containing gentamicin (25 g/mL) cell lysate from BMDMs containing intracellular bacteria was serially diluted with PBS and spread onto LB agar plates. phospho-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, IB, LaminB1, and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech. phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, phospho-STAT1 and anti-STAT1 antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA) monolayers of BMDMs in 96-well microplate were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. after 4 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed. fold changes were calculated after normalizing the change in expression of the gene of interest to the housekeeping gene -actin using the threshold cycle values. iNOS forward 5\u2032-CTCACCTACTTCCTGGACATTAC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CGCAGCTCTCTC-3\u2032. IL-6, and IL-10 in the culture supernatants were quantified using a sandwich ELISA kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. blots were then developed with an ECL detection system as per the manufacturer's instructions. BMDMs were seeded at 2 105 cells/well in 24-well culture plates (Corning) and pretreated with GA (100 g/mL) for 12 h. then cells were washed and incubated with 1 107 Escherichia coli (stain K88) or 2 107 Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. IL-4 (20 ng/mL) significantly decreased LDH release. BMDMs were incubated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. BMDMs treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. cells were harvested and stained with antibodies to CD80, CD86, and MHCII. expressions of surface molecules were analyzed by FACS. BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 6 h. cells and supernatants were collected. iNOS mRNA expression induced by GA increased to its peak at 6 h. Arg1 mRNA decreased by GA from basal levels to 30.64% of control at 24 h. BMDMs were treated with GA (25100 g/mL) GA significantly increased the uptake of extracellular bacteria E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium by BMDMs. the internalization of intracellular bacteria S. typhimurium had no significant difference between the GA-treated groups and the control groups. GA Activates MAPKs and NF-B Pathways in BMDMs. phosphorylation reached its peak at 30 min of treatment. GA did not induce phosphorylation of STAT1 in BMDMs. BMDMs were pretreated with NF-B inhibitor (BAY 11-7082, 10 M), JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 10 M), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580, 10 M), or ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126, 10 M) then the production of nitrite and M1-related cytokines was analyzed. ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect via induction of inhibitory factors, such as IL-10. BMDMs were pretreated with ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126, 10 M) followed by treatment with GA (100 g/mL) for (a) 6 h or (b) 48 h. BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. cell death was confirmed by measuring the release of the cytosolic marker LDH. BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL), IFN- (15 ng/mL) and IL-4 (20 ng/mL) BMDMs were treated with PBS, GA (100 g/mL), IFN- (15 ng/mL) + LPS (15 ng/mL) and IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 48 h of treatment. morphological characteristics of the GA-treated cells were more similar to those in M1-positive groups. BMDMs were treated with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. total RNA was extracted, and TNF-, IL-12, IL-6, Ym1, MR and FIZZ1 expressions were measured by real-time PCR. BMDMs were treated with GA (25100 g/mL) after 24 h of treatment, cells and supernatants were collected and subjected to western blotting with iNOS and -actin antibody. nitrite generation in supernatants was quantified as described in Section 2. GA markedly reduced the bacterial survival in BMDMs. BMDMs were pretreated with GA (100 g/mL) for 12 h. BMDMs were pretreated with GA (100 g/mL) for 12 h. western blotting examined the phosphorylation of MAPKs and STAT1. GA triggered a gradual increase of NF-B p65 protein in the nucleus. phosphorylation declined to almost basal level within 60 min of stimulation. BMDMs were pretreated with ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126, 10 M) followed by treatment with GA (100 g/mL) for 48 h. then the production of nitrite and M1-related cytokines was analyzed. a functional phenotype obtained by macrophages is dependent on interactions with specific stimuli from both endogenous and exogenous environment. a phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 occurs in the pathological process of cancer [16, 30]. m2 macrophages produce high levels of iNOS which synthesizes NO from arginine. m2 macrophages counteract iNOS activity by producing Arg1 which degrades arginine to urea and ornithine, thus reducing the production of NO. the results are supported by a report that GA reciprocally regulated the expression of iNOS and Arg1 in BMDMs, which led to an increased production of NF-B proteins are detached from its inhibitors after activation and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. GA induced phosphorylation of all three MAPKs, which was accompanied by nuclear translocation of NF-B p65. inhibition of ERK1/2 resulted in unexpected increases in NO and M1 cytokines production. GA decreased cellular attachment or uptake of CpG-DNA. it strongly impaired homodimerization of TLR4 in RAW 264.7 cells. it is still unclear how macrophages recognize GA. but the interaction between GA and cell membrane has been observed."}
