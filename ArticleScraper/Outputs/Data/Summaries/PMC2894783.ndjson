HBX expression inhibited turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin- arginine-galactosidase. HBX expression inhibited turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin- arginine-galactosidase. development of a specific inhibitor of the UPP may have potential as an antiviral, but also as an anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agent. study of interactions of components of the UPP with viral proteins may provide useful information relating to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. if SARS-CoV NP interacts with proteasome subunit p42 in vivo remains unknown. further studies are required to fully determine the nature of this interaction and its effect in vivo. this finding may lead to a new direction in research focusing on the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions QW and DL participated in the design. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
