{"summary": "globally, biodiversity is being lost at an accelerating rate, with current extinction rates approximately 1 000 times higher than background rates. between 2000 and 2012, 2.3 million km 2 of forest was lost globally and in the tropics forest loss increased each year. china has lost between 1.9 and 2.7 million km 2 of its original forest in the last 2 000 years. this is an area approximately the size of the Democratic Republic of Congo. at least three species have been extirpated from China. primatology in china is to evaluate one road for future conservation/development. there is clearly the need for restoration, as many of China\u2019s primates are only found in small isolated forests. there must be the right societal conditions to make restoration possible and the knowledge must be in hand to carry out such projects. urbanization rate rose from 17.9 to 52.6% between1978 and 2012. in many areas of southern china, primate populations can be dramatically reduced. illegal hunting has been a tradition promoted by poverty in local communities. species of diurnal primates were present in high numbers, including endangered red colobus and chimpanzee. a lot of research has accumulated over the last two or so decades that provides exactly the type of information needed for restoration/conservation efforts. conservation genetics is needed to determine the nature of corridors that can allow population mixing. information on past interpopulational gene flow and landscape barriers is needed to determine the dispersal capabilities of primates relative to different types of barriers. the only way to effectively promote conservation of these primates in the wild is through restoration. the only way to effectively promote conservation of these primates in the wild is through restoration."}
