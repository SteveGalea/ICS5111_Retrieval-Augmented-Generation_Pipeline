{"summary": "80% of infected individuals develop a chronic life long infection with a proportion progressing to significant liver disease such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma (3). the newly approved direct acting antivirals have improved sustained virological response rates (upwards of 95%), however, interferon- therapy is still required in combination to reduce the development of viral resistance. IFITM proteins are the first known ISGs to target late entry. they inhibit RNA viruses that require low pH-dependent entry into target cells. localization of IFITM3 to the late endosome and lysosome explains the unique antiviral actions of these ISGs. we investigated the role of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the full HCV life cycle, including entry, translation, replication, and egress. we present evidence that IFITM2 and IFITM3 display anti-HCV activity that may complement the anti-HCV activity of IFITM1 (18) pLenti6-mCherry-Rab5a, pRC-CMV-Viperin, and pRL-HL have been previously described. hepatoma cell lines Huh-7 and the HCV genomic replicon line NNeoC-5B were maintained as previously described. supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-transfection and filtered (0.45 m) luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega) mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) diluted at 1/1000 and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Millipore) diluted at 1/1000. mouse anti-human -actin (Sigma) was used to control loading of protein at 1:10,000. antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase were used.

Huh-7+IFITM and Huh-7+vector control cells were infected with HCV Jc1 (m.o.i. 0.03) and immunofluorescence analysis conducted 72 h later using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and human anti-HCV serum antibodies. the results corroborate the known anti-HCV roles of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 and their cellular localization. IFITM1 and IFITM3 demonstrate the anti-HCV nature of IFITM2 and IFITM3. we compared the ability of HCV psuedoparticles (HCVpp) to enter cells expressing IFITM1 compared with control. similar reductions in HCVpp entry were observed in cells expressing IFITM1 compared with control. IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 limit HCV entry into Huh-7 cells. A, Huh-7+IFITM and Huh-7+vector control cells were transduced with pseudoparticles containing envelopes of HCV, MLV, and VSV. viral entry was determined by luciferase activity 72 h post-transduction. cc system was no longer evident upon expression of the IFITM proteins in these cells. the IFITM proteins had no effect on HCV IRES promoter activity. we examined HCV egress using an extracellular:intracellular infectivity assay. vector control and immunofluorescence analysis conducted 48 h later using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and human anti-HCV serum antibodies. an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-human IgG respectively. we probed the Huh-7+IFITM cells with antibodies targeting early endosomes (Rab5a), late endosomes (Rab7), and lysosomes (Lamp1) co-localization immunofluorescence analysis found that both IFITM2 and IFITM3 partially co-localized with late and early endosomes. Huh-7+IFITM2 and Huh-7+IFITM3 cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit monoclonal anti-Rab7 antibodies. the cells were stained with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (20 m scale bar). tyrosine mutants generated tyrosine to alanine mutants for IFITM2 and IFITM3, Y19A and Y20A, respectively. a complete loss in phosphorylation was observed for Y19A and Y20A compared with wild-type IFITM2 and IFITM3 respectively. we extended our observations to the cellular localization of IFITM2:Y19A and IFITM3:Y20A compared with the viral exclusion phenotype was retained in cells expressing the tyrosine mutants. the mutants exhibited enhanced anti-HCV properties compared with wild-type. the results were unexpected based on previous studies where the mutation resulted in loss of anti-viral activity for IFITM3. IFITM proteins were precipitates with anti-FLAG antibodies and then tested in Western blotting with anti-tyrosine phosphorylation antibodies. tyrosine mutants were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, followed by an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. yount et al. (41) identified for the first time that the IFITM proteins undergo S-palmitoylation at three specific cysteine residues. two consecutive cysteine residues found in the first membrane-associated domain (M1), while the other cysteine residue is in the CIL. IFITM3 requires two cysteine residues found in the first membrane-associated domain (M1) for its anti-HCV activity. previous studies have reported conflicting roles of S-palmitoylation on IFITM localization within the cell. IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 require palmitoylation for anti-HCV activity. the mutants were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and either mouse anti-CD81 or rabbit anti-CD81. monoclonal anti-Lamp1 antibodies followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. ii, Huh-7 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM2 palmitoylation mutants. mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and either rabbit monoclonal anti-Ra d intracellular loop (CIL) but differing at their N- and C-terminal domains. IFITM2 and IFITM3 contain 20 and 21 amino acid extensions at the N-terminal domain, respectively. IFITM1 contains a 13-amino acid extension at the C terminus (5, 33) IFITM2 and IFITM3 inhibit HCV infection. schematic representation of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. IFITM1 differs from IFITM2 and IFITM3 with 21-amino acid truncation. Huh-7+IFITM and Huh-7+vector control cells were infected with HCV Jc1 (m.o.i. 0.03). total RNA was harvested at the indicated time points for RT-quantitative PCR. similar results were obtained upon extending HCV infection to 48 and 72 h. cells expressing the IFITM proteins do not appear to be infected with HCV. neighboring cells lacking IFITM expression were infected. IFITM2 localized solely to the cytoplasm and therefore did not co-localize with CD81. however, IFITM3 did partially co-localize with CD81 in some instances. none of the other HCV entry receptors tested (SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN) were found to interact with any of the IFITM proteins as determined by FRET and PLA. transient expression of each of the IFITM proteins did not significantly affect HCV RNA replication in genomic HCV replicon cell lines. this is in contrast to the anti-HCV activity of the well characterized ISG viperin that served as a positive control (30, 34) IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 have no effect on HCV RNA replication, translation, or egress. i, HCV genomic replicon cells were transduced with each of the IFITM proteins, viperin, and the vector control for 48 h and total RNA harvested for RT-quantitative PCR for HCV RNA levels. IFITM2 and IFITM3 co-localize with early and late endosomes and Lysosomes in Hepatocytes. the cellular localization of IFITM2 and IFITM3 has been examined in a number of different cell lines (A549, HEK293, and HeLa) in relation to their antiviral activity against other viruses. cells were transfected with mCherry-Rab5a expression plasmid. 24 h later cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibodies. the cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit monoclonal anti-rab7 antibodies. the three IFITM proteins discovered that this N-terminal tyrosine residue is conserved in IFITM2 (Tyr-19) but is not present in IFITM1 due to the 21-amino acid N-terminal truncation. we investigated the importance of this conserved N-terminal tyrosine residue on the anti-HCV activity of IFITM2 and IFITM3. the majority of protein localization was redistributed to the plasma membrane with some perinuclear localization still present. the change in localization would alter the anti-HCV activity of IFITM2 and IFITM3. the viral exclusion phenotype was retained in cells expressing the tyrosine mutants. tyrosine mutant derivatives are important for IFITM2 and IFITM3 cellular localization but not anti-HCV activity. IFITM proteins were precipitates with anti-FLAG antibodies and then tested in Western blotting. yount et al. (41) identified for the first time that the IFITM proteins undergo S-palmitoylation at three specific cysteine residues. the Cys-72 residue of IFITM3 is vital for antiviral activity against influenza A and Dengue virus (16, 41, 42) double (M1, C50A/C51A; M2, C70A/C71A; M3, C71A/C72A) and single (M1, C84A; M2, C104A; M3, C105A) cysteine to alanine mutants were generated for each of the IFITM proteins. previous studies have reported conflicting roles of S-palmitoylation on IFITM localization within the cell. IFITM2 retained partial co-localization at the late endosome and lysosome similar to wild-type. this indicates the importance of this cysteine residue and hence conceivably S-palmitoylation for the anti-HCV activity of these proteins. i, Huh-7 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants. ii, Huh-7 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and either mouse anti-CD81 or rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 are potential anti-HCV effector molecules. all three IFITM proteins share high amino acid homology. they contain two hydrophobic membrane-associated domains (M1 and M2) separated by a conserved intracellular loop. IFITM1 cells were either pretreated with 50 IU/ml of IFN- for 24 h followed by HCV Jc1 infection or infected with Jc1 prior to stimulation with IFN-. Interestingly the anti-HCV activity of IFN- is attenuated in IFITM1 shRNA cells compared with controls only in the pre-IFN- treatment setting. mean S.E. with a significance of *, p = 0.035, calculated using a Student's t test. C, Huh-7+IFITM and Huh-7+vector control cells were stained with a mouse monolconal anti-FLAG antibody, followed by an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (i) or cellular lysate harvested to detect specific IFITM protein expression (ii) HCV infection (Jc1) of the stable Huh-7+IFITM cell lines demonstrated that IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 were able to significantly decrease HCV RNA levels by 77, 61, and 57%. similar results were obtained upon extending HCV infection to 48 and 72 h. IFITM2 and IFITM3 show a predominantly intracellular localization. we confirmed the co-localization of IFITM1 with CD81. however, IFITM3 localized solely to the cytoplasm. predominantly cytoplasmic, did partially co-localize with CD81. cells were stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and mouse anti-CD81, followed by an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and a goat anti-mouse IgG. cells were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using FRET (Carl Zeizz, Oberkochen, Germany) all three IFITM proteins block de novo HCV infection with no detectable effect on other stages of the HCV life cycle. i, HCV genomic replicon cells were transduced with each of the IFITM proteins, viperin, and the vector control for 48 h. cellular supernatant was applied to naive cells 24 h post-electroporation. at 72 h post-infection focus-forming units were enumerated using human anti-HCV serum antigens. i, extracellular FFU and intracellular FFU titers expressed as FFU/ml. IFITM2 and IFITM3 partially co-localize with early and late endosomes. all three IFITM proteins co-localize with lysosomes. cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-mCherry antibodies. HCV Activity Tyrosine residue 20 (Tyr-20) in the N-terminal domain of IFITM3 has recently been identified to be important for both cellular localization and antiviral activity. recent studies have demonstrated Tyr-20 to be part of an endocytic signal (YEML) targeting IFITM3 to the late endosome (38, 39) Y19A and Y20A mutants exhibited enhanced anti-HCV properties compared with wild-type tyrosine mutants. y19A and Y20A mutants exhibited enhanced anti-HCV properties compared with wild-type IFITM3. significant co-localization was observed between the IFITM2 and IFITM3 tyrosine mutants and CD81. the conserved N-terminal tyrosine residue in IFITM2 and IFITM3 is important for cellular localization but not anti-HCV activity. ii, Huh-7+IFITM2:Y19A and Huh-7+IFITM3:Y20A were infected with HCV Jc1 (m.o.i. 0.03) and immunofluorescence analysis was conducted 72 h later using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and human anti-HCV serum antibodies. S-palmitoylation of the IFITM proteins is not required for anti-HIV activity. double (M1, C50A/C51A; M2, C70A/C71A; M3, C71A/C72A) and single (M1, C84A; M2, C104A; M3, C105A) cysteine to alanine mutants were generated for each of the IFITM proteins. mutation of the cysteine residue within the CIL resulted in each of the IFITM proteins predominantly localizing to the lysosome. this redistribution was also observed for M1 palmitoylation mutants C50A/C51A and C71A/C72A in IFITM1 and IFITM3, respectively. the mutants retained partial co-localization at the late endosome and lysosome similar to wild-type. ii, Huh-7 cells transiently transfected or 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and either mouse anti-CD81 or rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 antibodies. ii, Huh-7 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation plasmid stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry or rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 antibodies, followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. all three IFITM proteins share high amino acid homology, containing two hydrophobic membrane-associated domains. we were unable to design specific RT-PCR primers or obtain specific antibodies for either protein. to determine the role of endogenous IFITM1 following IFN- stimulation, we generated a polyclonal Huh-7 cell line expressing shRNA specifically targeting IFITM1 mRNA. ii, Huh7+shControl and Huh-7+shIFITM1 cells were either pretreated for 24 h before Jc1 infection (m.o.i. = 0.03) or post-treated 24 h after Jc1 infection for 16 h with 50 IU/ml of IFN-. total RNA was harvested for RT-quantitative PCR for HCV RNA levels. we generated polyclonal Huh-7 cells expressing each of the IFITM proteins (Huh-7+IFITM) with a N-terminal FLAG tag. protein expression in these stable cell lines was confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. we observed a significant reduction in the entry of HCVpp into cells expressing IFITM1 compared with control cells. similar reductions in HCVpp entry were observed in cells expressing IFITM2 and IFITM3. we then examined the localization of IFITM2 and IFITM3. Huh-7+IFITM cells stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and mouse anti-CD81 antibodies, followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. cells were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using FRET. naive Huh-7+IFITM and vector control cells were electroporated with HCV Jc1 RNA to bypass entry. after 24 h the extracellular and intracellular supernatant was applied onto naive Huh-7 cells prior to measurement of HCV infectivity by a focus-forming assay. vector control cells were transfected with IRES-luc for 48 h. vector control cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of IL-29 for 24 h. extracellular and intracellular supernatant was applied to naive cells. both IFITM2 and IFITM3 were found to co-localize with late endosomes. partial co-localization between intracellular IFITM1 and lysosomes was also observed in some cells. stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 antibodies. followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (20 m scale bar) the conserved N-terminal tyrosine residue is conserved in IFITM2 (Tyr-19) but is not present in IFITM1 due to the 21-amino precipitated samples were probed by immunoblot with antibodies targeting phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr(P)) a complete loss in phosphorylation was observed for Y19A and Y20A compared with wild-type IFITM2 and IFITM3 respectively. the loss of a single tyrosine residue reverted IFITM2 and IFITM3 to an IFITM1-like phenotype. significant co-localization was observed between the IFITM2 and IFITM3 tyrosine mutants and CD81 (Fig. 6), mirroring the localization of IFITM1. total RNA was harvested at the indicated time points for RT-quantitative PCR for HCV RNA levels. ii, Huh-7+IFITM2:Y19A and Huh-7+IFITM3:Y20A were infected with HCV Jc1 (m.o.i. 0.03) yount et al. (41) identified for the first time that the IFITM proteins undergo S-palmitoylation at three specific cysteine residues. two consecutive cysteine residues found in the first membrane-associated domain (M1), while the other cysteine residue is in the CIL. yount et al. (41) demonstrated that S-palmitoylation played a role in clustering of IFITM3 near the ER, whereas John et al. (16) showed the converse, where the removal of the cysteine residues resulted in significant clustering within the cell. IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 require palmitoylation for anti-HCV activity. ii, Huh-7 cells transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants. iii, Huh-7 cells transfected for 24 h with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants. mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and either rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry or rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 antibodies were stained with either wild-type IFITM1 or the respective IFITM1 palmitoylation mutants. the observed restriction of HCV entry was not as significant as that observed for IFITM1. the localization of IFITM2 and IFITM3 at both early and late endosomes as well as lysosomes indicates that these proteins are following the established paradigm of acting at the late entry stages of HCV entry. infection by preventing viral-endosomal fusion thereby \u201ctrapping\u201d the endocytosed virion within the endocytic pathway targeting it for lysosomal degradation. the ability of the IFITM proteins to alter membrane fluidity and curvature to prevent viral hemifusion provides an explanation for this hypothesis (45) the addition of palmitoyl groups is associated with protein stability, localization, and the association of proteins with lipid rafts. we also noted that mutation of the M1 cysteine residues in IFITM1 and IFITM2 retained anti-HCV activity despite partial retention of wild-type localization. this suggests that the exact mechanisms of antiviral activity of these proteins is both virus and cell-type specific. authors designed the study and wrote the paper. authors analyzed the results and approved the final version of the manuscript."}
