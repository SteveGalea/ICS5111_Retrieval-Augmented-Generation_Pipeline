{"summary": "nasal administration of TNF produces late phase co-appearance of granulocyte and plasma exudation markers on the mucosal surface. the objective of the present study was to examine indices of granulocyte presence and activity in response to intranasal TNF challenge. tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine of the immune system. in human bronchial airways, TNF is produced by several cell types. in refractory asthma, treatment with etanercept is associated with improvement in asthma symptoms. studies in allergic rhinitis may elucidate specific roles for TNF in type-1 allergic inflammation, which may not be done in allergic asthma. the aim of the present study was to examine characteristics of the inflammatory process evoked by human nasal administration of TNF. subjects Thirteen healthy subjects (5 females, 8 males, aged 20\u201328 years) and 14 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (8 females, 6 males, aged 23\u201345 years) participated in the study. inclusion criteria were: negative skin prick-test, normal nasal examination, and use of contraceptives. the sham challenge was administered using a spray-device delivering 100 l per actuation. the challenge was given in a randomized order. the right hand side nasal cavity was challenged at the first visit. the biopsies were taken from the inferior aspect of the inferior turbinate. the biopsies were immersed overnight in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2), dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol. sections were blinded and numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils counted down to 210 m below epithelial basement membrane. monoclonal antibody EG2 detects the granule protein MPO. 2-macroglobulin as well as biopsy numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. 11 of the allergic subjects were skin-prick positive for both birch and timothy grass allergens. one was sensitized to birch alone and one to timothy grass alone. none of the subjects had positive skin-prick tests for house dust mite. eezes, secretion, and blockage were each scored on a four-graded scale. eezes, secretion, and blockage were added to a total nasal symptom score. lavages were performed immediately after the symptom scoring. human 2-macroglobulin (Capell-Organon, Turnhout, Belgium) was iodinated. the bound fraction was measured using a gamma counter. IL-8 was measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. sections were incubated in mouse APAAP (Dako D0651, dilution 1:50 in 20% NHS) for 30 min, rinsed, and developed using new Fuchsin (Dako) as substrate. numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils were counted down to 210 m below epithelial basement membrane. subjects with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0081) and in patients with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0081) were not affected by the TNF challenge. a subgroup analysis revealed that this change reflected a statistically significant increase in the healthy group (p = 0.0015), but not in the allergic rhinitis group. numbers of subepithelial neutrophils in nasal biopsies obtained 24 hours post TNF and sham challenge in healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis. eosinophils in nasal biopsies obtained 24 hours post TNF and sham challenge, respectively. the dose of TNF and the time-point for monitoring of the present response was chosen based on our previous observation. in the present study, the plasma exudation producing effect of TNF (10 g) at this time-point was confirmed. the finding is in agreement with our previous observation in allergic rhinitis. we have no specific explanation for the present numerically higher levels of MPO observed in healthy subjects following TNF challenge. however, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.5, Mann Whitney) rhinitis did produce a numerical increase in neutrophils also in allergic rhinitis. no marked differences emerged between healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis. however, further studies may be warranted in order to elucidate whether TNF has a specific role in allergic airway conditions. findings suggest beneficial effects of anti-TNF drugs in refractory asthma may reflect anti-neutrophil rather than anti-eosinophil effects. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
