{"summary": "influenza viruses and coronaviruses are potentially lethal pathogens known to produce lung injury and death from ARDS[2-5] at the tissue level, lung injury results from increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane that leads to hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and intense cellular infiltration. virus-induced ARDS is slowly becoming understood. 30 of 36 isolates from the nasopharyngeal secretions of patients with severe respiratory illness were identified as EV-D68. despite all critical care support measures, the patient required protracted mechanical ventilation for 32-d, necessitating tracheostomy and endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. she was discharged alive 55 d following admission. intravenous vitamin C infused ascorbic acid at 1 g every 8 h combined with oral vitamin E for 28 d in 594 surgically critically ill patients. septic patients receiving high dose intravenous vitamin C exhibit significant reduction in multiple organ injury and reduced inflammatory biomarker levels. a 20-year-old white woman presented to urgent care with 24 h of increasing dyspnea after returning from a 7-d trip to Italy. she noted cough and yellow sputum for 3 d with intermittent fever and night sweats. she denied any history of thromboembolic disease, chest or leg pain or swelling. high-dose intravenous vitamin C (200 mg/kg per 24 h) was initiated on ECMO day 1 with the total daily vitamin C dosage divided equally into four doses and infused every 6 h. AP chest X-ray imaging on ECMO day 3 revealed significant improvement in bilateral lung opacities. critically ill patients with severe sepsis treated with the identical vitamin C infusion protocol achieved plasma ascorbic acid levels of 3.2 mmol. values are 60 fold higher than normal plasma ascorbic acid levels[18]. clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was established by the extent of respiratory failure present, the radiographic findings, and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support required. the patient\u2019s exposure to the sick contact in Italy suggested the diagnosis of a viral etiology. clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this case was established by the extent of respiratory failure present, the radiographic findings, and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support required. the patient\u2019s exposure to the sick contact in Italy suggested the diagnosis of a viral etiology. authors may have shed new light on a treatment which may be effective. the successful outcome described in this case report would suggest that larger trials must be conducted with high dose intravenous vitamin C."}
