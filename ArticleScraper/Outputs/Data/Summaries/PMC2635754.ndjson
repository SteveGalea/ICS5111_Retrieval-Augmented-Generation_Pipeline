{"summary": "influenza viruses are a major concern for public health officials due to their potential to cause pandemics. mutated and/or reassorted virus with efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger an influenza pandemic. the use of existing antivirals, primarily oseltamivir (Tamiflu) could be critical in the initial control of a pandemic. dsRNA cells express numerous toll-like receptors (TLRs) [10] and respond to microbial pathogens by producing type I interferons (IFN) and cytokines. poly (ICLC), a dsRNA, and CpG ODNs, molecular mimics for TLR3 and TLR9, respectively, have been reported to non-specifically stimulate the innate immune system. ed RNA produced during viral replication is recognized by an intracellular protein, TLR3, present in T, NK [15, 19, 20], mast [21] and epithelial cells. recognition by TLR3 results in enhanced production of IFN-, -, and -, IL-1, -6, -8, -12, -15 and -18, IP-10, GM-CSF, regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), LARC polyadenosinic-polyuridylic acid (AU) and Ampligen (polyI:polyC(12)U) have been used as TLR3 molecular mimics [24, 30, 32, 33] it has recently been demonstrated that TLR3 also binds polyriboinosinic acid, a ssRNA [34]. poly (ICLC) acts by inducing IFN production (immunomodulator) and activating an intracellular enzyme (RNase-L) against viral RNA transcripts (antiviral) in mice, two doses of 1 mg/kg/dose poly (ICLC) given intranasally (i.n.) provided complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) viral challenge. mice treated with two doses of poly (ICLC), 48 h apart, up to 12 d prior to viral challenge were completely protected from infection. survival rates decreased to 80, 40 and 0% when pre-treatment was given 14, 16 or 20 d prior to virus challenge. poly (ICLC) may provide short-term prophylaxis against influenza in an outbreak situation. poly ICLC treatment decreased the number of VEEV-infected monkeys that become detectably viremic and delayed the onset of viremia in the remaining monkeys. when mice were dosed i.p. with 10 mg/kg Ampligen 4 h prior to SARS-CoV exposure, viral titres in the lungs were below detectable limits. a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine co-administered with Ampligen provided cross-protection against various strains of H5N1 influenza virus. poly (ICLC) adjuvant activity has been shown when co-administered with retinoic acid [58], VEEV vaccine [59, 60] and antimalarial drug chloroquine [61]. pre-treatment with either IFN-/ or poly (IC) elicited strong antiviral responses that completely prevented flavivirus replication in macrophages from resistant mice. anti-Semliki Forest virus hyperimmune serum or poly (ICLC) given i.p. were not protective when used alone following an intracranial Semliki Forest virus infection. exhibited serious toxic reactions including hypotension, fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, injection site inflammation and, in multiple sclerosis patients, neurological dysfunction [54, 68\u201377]. Attempt to improve safety and efficacy of poly (ICLC) have focused on optimization of dosage and treatment regimes, encapsulation within liposomes, modification of poly (ICLC), and co-administration of agents that mitigate cytokine-mediated adverse reactions. mice given free poly (ICLC) were completely protected if treatment was within 12 d of infection. liposomes have been shown to accumulate at sites of infection [79] liposome encapsulation results in a gradual and sustained release of poly (ICLC) thereby avoiding rapid systemic elevation of drug levels observed with some routes of administration. ive thiolation of the poly (C) strand generates a partially thiolated poly (C) (MPC) which forms the thiolated dsRNA, pI:MPC. Optimal antiviral and antiproliferative activities were obtained when thiolation was at 7.4% [81]. poly (ICLC) may provide short-term prophylaxis against influenza viral challenge. mice were given 20 g (1 mg/kg body weight) of poly (ICLC) intranasally 48 and 8 h prior to challenge with a lethal dose of influenza A/PR/8/34 or A/Aichi/2/68. mice treated with two i.v. doses (1 mg/kg/dose) of poly (ICLC) 8 and 48 h post-infection (p.i.) showed a small increase in survival (40%) relative to untreated mice. post-exposure treatment with a single dose was found to be almost completely ineffective. a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine co-administered with Ampligen provided cross-protection against various strains of H5N1 influenza virus. poly (ICLC) adjuvant activity has been shown when co-administered with retinoic acid [58], VEEV vaccine [59, 60] and antimalarial drug chloroquine [61]. a phase I study of poly (ICLC) in patients with a variety of cancers showed moderate toxicity of poly (ICLC) at all doses tested. no increases in peripheral blood NK cell activity was observed after treatment with poly (ICLC) alone. high doses of poly (ICLC) in combination with IL-2 resulted in NK cell activity greater than that seen using the same dose of IL-2 in combination with lower poly (ICLC) doses. poly (ICLC) administered on an alternate-day schedule with gradual dose escalation was tolerated the best with the maximum tolerated dose varying over a several hundredfold dose range. in mice, poly (ICLC) administration results in loss of 10% of the total body weight and hypothermia of up to 2\u00b0C. IL-1R signalling pathway agonists and hydrocortisone treatment are involved in increased plasma IL-6 concentrations. male rats given IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1ra) prior to poly (IC) administration had elevated plasma TNF-, but not IL-6, concentrations with a concomitant reduction in fever. pG ODNs are under-represented in vertebrate DNA (1 in 64 base pairs) and are generally methylated on the cytosine. bacterial DNA contains unmethylated CpG dinucleotides at the expected frequency of 1 in 16 base pairs. they are rapidly internalized by immune cells through the endocytosis / phagocytosis pathway. in mice, immune cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes, macrophages, myeloid DCs) express TLR9. in humans, memory B (but not nave B cells) [92] and pDCs express TLR9. a mixed DNA backbone with the phosphorothioate backbone renders the CpG ODN more resistant to nucleases. a biphasic plasma elimination profile was observed in mice and rats. a significant amount was detected in the spleen [97]. FN- secretion and maturation of human DCs in vitro [100] induce IFN- within the first 12 h with considerable amounts still produced at 24\u201348 h [93] - indirectly activate monocytes to differentiate into myeloid DCs and produce chemokines (IL-10) [88] - trigger the maturation of APCs [88] - do not stimulate B-cells or other subsets of DCs [89] - active in mice [89], non studies of K-type CpG ODNs indicate that the sequence, number and location of CpG motifs influence the magnitude of the resultant response. K-type CpG ODNs may preferentially trigger early type I IFN production, while D-type CpG ODNs may support late type I IFN production via the IFN-mediated feedback loop. mice were given 5 g of free or liposome-encapsulated CpG ODN i.n. 4 d prior to infection with influenza A/PR/8/34. liposomes were composed of DMTAP/CH/DOPC. mice were monitored daily for appearance, weight and survival. a clinical study on patients with various types of B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma found that most B cell malignancies responded to CpG ODNs by up-regulating expression of co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. the proliferative response was less than in normal B cells [105]. the results suggest that it may be possible to use CpG ODNs as adjuvants to expand the potency and efficacy of antiviral vaccines the disparate results observed with mice infected with HSV-2 can likely be attributed to the timing of CpG ODN administration with treatment 24 h prior to infection resulting in complete protection and treatment 2\u20136 h post-infection resulting in partial protection. ated vaccine plus CpG ODN had up to 30 times higher serum and mucosal IgG2a and IgA levels. in a double-blind study, 1 mg of CpG ODNs were co-administered with a commercial killed split influenza vaccine (Fluarix, SmithKline Beecham) serum anti-HBs antibodies were observed after a single dose of rHBsAg plus 3 mg 1018 ISS in 87.5% of subjects. those not receiving 1018 ISS did not produce protective antibodies. in phase I clinical studies, seroprotective anti-HBsAg antibody titers were observed after a single dose. repeated injection of immunostimulatory doses of CpG DNA does not appear to induce or accelerate systemic autoimmune disease [140\u2013142], however, allergic encephalomyelitis [143, 144], autoimmune myocarditis [145], joint inflammation [146] and overproduction of TNF- which can cause life-threatening toxic shock [90, 147\u2013149] have been demonstrated. liposome-encapsulation can be used to decrease dosage required for activity. co-administration with influenza vaccine or HBsAg showed a Th1-dominant or mixed Th1/Th2 response in the influenza and hepatitis B models. phosphorothioate CpG ODNs could also function in a TLR9-independent manner. a synthetic nucleoside \u201cR\u201d with a bicyclic heterobase has been used to replace the C in the CpG dinucleotide motif. a synthetic nucleoside \u201cR\u201d with a bicyclic heterobase has been used to replace the C in the CpG dinucleotide motif. mice were given 5 g (0.25 mg/kg body weight) of free or liposome-encapsulated CpG ODN i.n. 4 d prior to infection with influenza A/PR/8/34. liposomes were composed of DMTAP/CH/DOPC. mice were monitored daily for appearance, weight and survival. a

killed split influenza vaccine (Fluarix, SmithKline Beecham) PBMCs from CpG ODN-vaccinated subjects responded to in vitro re-stimulation by secreting significantly higher levels of IFN- than PBMCs from control vaccinees. 87.5% of subjects received higher doses of rHBsAg plus 3 mg 1018 ISS. those not receiving 1018 ISS did not produce protective antibodies. rituximab is an anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody. repeated injection of immunostimulatory doses of CpG DNA does not appear to induce or accelerate systemic autoimmune disease [140\u2013142], however, allergic encephalomyelitis [143, 144], autoimmune myocarditis [145], joint inflammation [146] and overproduction of TNF-. liposome-encapsulation of CpG ODNs has been used to reduce toxicity and prolong exposure due to gradual release of the CpG ODN from liposomes. co-administration with a subunit influenza vaccine or HBsAg showed a Th1-dominant or mixed Th1/Th2 response in the influenza and hepatitis B models. treatment with phosphorothioate CpG ODNs had no effect unless co-administered with Lipofection transfection agent suggesting phosphorothioate CpG ODNs could also function in a TLR9-independent manner. a synthetic nucleoside \u201cR\u201d with a bicyclic heterobase has been used to replace the C in the CpG dinucleotide motif. a synthetic nucleoside \u201cR\u201d has been used to replace the C in the CpG dinucleotide motif. immunomers induced high levels of IL-12 and IFN- in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion in mouse splenocytes costimulated with IL-2. single-stranded RNA induction of TLR7 also stimulates autophagy in macrophages. this induction appears to be effective in eliminating intracellular microbes. TLR7 is essential for influenza viral recognition and inflammatory cytokine production. a modest increase in TLR7 expression resulted in spontaneous development of autoimmunity and a substantial increase in TLR7 expression caused fatal acute inflammation and profound DC dysregulation. in humans, PBMCs isolated from females produced significantly higher IFN- levels after TLR7 stimulation than did PBMCs isolated from males. sialic acid linked to galactose via -2,3 glycosidic bonds is a cellular receptor located in the eye. infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages in the lungs is observed. production of reactive oxygen species, which contributes to pulmonary tissue damage, is observed. protective immunity was closely related to the percentage of CD8(+) T cells expressing IFN- in the lung, rather than in the spleen. there are significant differences in cytokine responses between H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses, primarily in relation to IFN-, IL-6, IP-10 and RANTES. HK viruses fail to activate latent TGF- in birds. virus-infected cells in mice infected with influenza H5N1/97. virus-infected cells appear in the respiratory tract. mice infected with the lethal influenza virus HK483 also had increased concentrations of IL-1, TNF-, IFN-, MIP-1 and MIP-2 in the brain, and apoptosis in the spleen and lung [194] the local synthesis of TNF- or IL-1 within the brain could contribute to anorexia, weight loss and death [198] non-specific immune stimulators should be effective in influenza H5N1 viral infection. prevention of apoptosis of T cells could increase TNF-, IFN-, IL-2, -3, -4, -5, -9, -10 and -15. mice deficient for TNF- or its receptors had no reduction in mortality. TLR3 agonist plus TLR7/8 agonists had an additive effect on IFN-/ responses in human PBMCs. treatment of mice with liposome-encapsulated poly (ICLC) has been evaluated for efficacy against influenza A/H5N1/chicken/Henan. poly (ICLC) or CpG ODN was given before RSV infection. mice had a milder disease and/or faster recovery with increased IFN production. but when either poly (ICLC) or CpG ODN was administered 48 h post-RSV infection, IFN- production was almost completely inhibited. poly (ICLC) and poly (ICLC) were able to effectively protect aged mice against lethal murine cytomegalovirus infection. poly (ICLC) and poly (ICLC) were able to induce IFN and NK cell cytotoxicity in these mice. these results suggest that both poly (ICLC) and CpG ODNs have potential to be effective. poly (ICLC) and CpG ODN are co-utilized. poly (ICLC) and CpG ODN remain to be evaluated."}
