{"summary": "two-photon excitation microscopy in a biosafety level (BSL) 3 facility approved for animal experiments involving highly virulent influenza viruses. the laser beam was supplied to the microscope in the BSL3 room via a small glass window. to reduce lung motion-derived artifacts during imaging, we stabilized the mouse lung by using a custom-made thoracic lung window. Virus-infected Venus-positive epithelial cells began to emerge in the lungs of MA-Venus-H5N1\u2013infected mice on day 2 postinfection (p.i.) on all 3 d, the numbers of H5N1-infected cells were higher than those in mice infected with PR8 virus. signals larger than 50 m2 were considered to be virus-infected cells. signals smaller than 50 m2 were considered debris-like objects. number of debris-like objects in MA-Venus-PR8\u2013infected lung increased only on day 4 p.i. infection with the H5N1 strain progressed faster and caused a higher level of tissue damage than infection with the PR8 strain. an attractive application of in vivo two-photon excitation microscopy is to monitor the pulmonary hemodynamics in live tissue. xtran leakage was detected on day 2 p.i. and dramatically increased on day 4 p.i.. timing of this increase in pulmonary permeability correlated with increase in number of dead cells in the MA-Venus-H5N1\u2013infected lungs. the asterisk indicates P 0.05 compared with nave (uninfected) mice. inflammation often reduces the speed of blood flow (18), potentially causing hypoxemia. i.v. inoculating mice with a phycoerythrin-conjugated neutrophil-specific anti\u2013Ly-6G antibody (1A8) visualized neutrophils in influenza virus-infected lung. neutrophils appear and disappear under two-photon excitation microscopic fields, but counting neutrophils from a snapshot does not accurately reflect their numbers. in lungs infected with MA-Venus-H5N1, strong recruitment of neutrophils was observed on day 1 postinfection. peak neutrophil recruitment was on day 2 p.i.; however, the number of recruited neutrophils was significantly lower than that in H5N1 infection. this result suggests that PR8 infection may not only progress more moderately than H5N1 infection but also be less potent in inducing neutrophil recruitment to infectious foci in the lung. all neutrophils observed under the same conditions were arranged along the y axis. the amount of time each neutrophil was engaged in slow (blue) or rapid (red) motion was plotted along the x axis. each dot represents the data obtained from an individual animal. neutrophil movement was defined as a sudden boost of speed of >50 m/s. the latter occurs when the cells travel along the alveolar microcapillaries. we then analyzed the amount of time neutrophils engaged in each motion. influenza virus infection reduces neutrophil movement after peak day of neutrophil recruitment. vascular neutrophil recruitment occurred 1 d before number of virus-infected cells increased. vascular neutrophil recruitment occurred 1 d earlier and at a much higher level than did PR8. two-photon excitation microscopy in a biosafety level facility approved for animal experiments involving highly virulent influenza viruses. the two-photon excitation microscopy was built on an antivibration table outside of the BSL3 area. the laser path was adjusted in real time by using a beam-pointing stabilizer, the Aligna 4D System (TEM Messtechnik) virus-infected Venus-positive epithelial cells began to emerge in the lungs of MA-Venus-H5N1\u2013infected mice on day 2 postinfection (p.i.) on all 3 d, the numbers of H5N1-infected cells were higher than those in mice infected with PR8 virus. fluorescent dextran (blue) was i.v. administered to the mice to visualize vascular structures. median numbers of influenza virus-infected cells (Venus-positive cells) in the fields of view at the indicated time points. each dot represents the data obtained from an individual animal. only a few dead cells were found on day 4 post\u2013MA-Venus-PR8 infection. infection with the H5N1 strain progressed faster and caused a higher level of tissue damage than infection with the PR8 strain. dextran leakage was first detected on day 2 p.i. and dramatically increased on day 4 p.i.. the timing of this increase in pulmonary permeability correlated with the increase in the number of dead cells in the MA-Venus-H5N1\u2013infected lungs. plot shows the percentage of extravascular area positive for the dextran signal in each field of view. each data point is color-coded to reflect the intensity level of the extravascular dextran signal. i.v. inoculating mice with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated neutrophil-specific anti\u2013Ly-6G antibody (1A8) visualized neutrophils in influenza virus-infected lung. neutrophils appear and disappear under two-photon excitation. in lungs infected with MA-Venus-H5N1, strong recruitment of neutrophils was observed on day 1 postinfection. after the 5.6-fold increase on day 1 p.i. (\u201cpeak day\u201d), the number of neutrophils detected in the lungs infected with the H5N1 strain returned to the level found in nave mice over the following days. this result suggests that PR8 infection may not only progress more moderately than H5N1 infection but may also be less all neutrophils observed under the same conditions were arranged along the y axis according to the duration of their slow motion. the amount of time each neutrophil was engaged in slow (blue) or rapid (red) motion was plotted along the x axis according to the duration of their slow motion. eous neutrophil movement with a speed of 50 m/s was defined as \u201cslow motion\u201d (mean speed 3.7 m/s; SI Appendix, Fig. S3B) the latter neutrophil movement likely occurs when the cells travel along the alveolar microcapillaries. the amount of time the neutrophils spent in slow motion significantly increased at later time points postinfection. the timing of the change in neutrophil motion was similar for both H5N1 and PR8 infection, starting at 1 d after the peak day of neutrophil recruitment. the line graphs were generated by connecting the mean or median numbers at different time points originating from Fig. 1B for the number of virus-infected cells, Fig. 2C for pulmonary permeability, Fig. 3B for blood flow speed, Fig. 4A for the number of recruited neutrophils, and Fig. 4F for the duration of slow neutrophil movement. the use of fluorescent influenza viruses enabled the detection of the spread of influenza viruses and corresponding changes in blood flow speed and H1N1 viruses replicate productively in alveolar epithelial cells (27) phenotypes may result from differences in replicative ability and cytopathicity in the infected cells. immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages, natural killer cells, are also susceptible to some influenza viruses. decrease in blood flow speed may reflect early inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection. vascular permeability seen with the H5N1 virus may likely be caused by infection of endothelial cells or loss of tight capillary cell-to-cell interaction due to high levels of cytokines. flu virus infection results in an appreciable reduction in neutrophil motility in the lung. the changes in neutrophil motility may be related to how these cells attach to the endothelia and extravasate. neutrophils slow down and possibly infiltrate into the infected foci in vivo. in vivo imaging system and quantitative analyses allowed us to reveal the progression of pathological features and their dynamics at the cellular level. both strains of influenza virus were used at a lethal but equivalent dose (15) and then the timing of the emergence of infected cells and the pathophysiological changes in the infected lungs were compared over the course of the infection. in vivo imaging was performed by using an infrared laser (Chameleon; Coherent) the wavelength of the infrared laser was set to 910 nm for simultaneous excitation of SYTOX blue, PE, Venus, Texas red dextran. all emitted light between 410- and 695-nm wavelengths was detected using a 20 water-immersion lens (Carl Zeiss) to prevent the spread of virus-containing aerosols, high-efficiency particulate air filters were installed in the suction duct of the thoracic lung window. the operator wore a positive pressure mask (Versaflo faceshields; 3M) and a Tyvek suit (DuPont) to avoid exposure to Texas red dextran (100 g) or SYTOX blue (50 L of a 50 M stock solution) was injected i.v. before imaging to visualize the lung structure or dead cells. for imaging and analysis of pulmonary permeability, we injected Texas red dextran into mice during image acquisition. low-intensity signals indicated that the dextran had leaked into the alveolar space. in both cases, the relative fluorescent intensity of the dextran within the alveolar space was measured as an indicator of pulmonary permeability. ophil performed rapid movement (Fig. 4E) and calculated the average duration it engaged in continuous slow movements without being interrupted by the sudden bursts of rapid movement. all movies were corrected for respiratory motion artifacts by using the demons algorithm (58, 59), a common algorithm for nonrigid registration, using the code implemented by MathWorks. all animal care and experiments were approved by the animal research committee of the university of Tokyo (PA11-49). Viruses. MA-Venus-H5N1 and MA-Venus-PR8 strains were propagated in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells. mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and placed on a microscope stage. a custom-made thoracic suction window was inserted between the ribs. the operator wore a positive pressure mask and a Tyvek suit to avoid exposure to the viruses. mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFUs of MA-Venus-H5N1 or MA-Venus-PR8. a signal covering >50 m2 was defined as a \u201ccell,\u201d whereas signals of 50 m2 were defined as \u201cdebris-like\u201d objects. fluorescent microspheres (50 L of a 108 beads per milliliter stock solution) were injected i.v. into mice and imaged at 15 frames per second. the speed of the blood flow was measured by tracking the movement of the microspheres. processing, assays, and data visualization were performed using CellProfiler (Broad Institute), in-house MATLAB scripts (MathWorks), and Prism 6 (GraphPad Software. all data were expressed as either the mean or median, as indicated in the relevant portion of the text.
