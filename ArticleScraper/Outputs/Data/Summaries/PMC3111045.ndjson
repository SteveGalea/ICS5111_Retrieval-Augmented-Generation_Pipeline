{"summary": "RVF is endemic to sub-Saharan africa countries. it has caused major outbreaks in several countries. ruminants infected with RVFV typically are subject to high-rate abortions. effective vaccines and antiviral drugs are necessary for the containment of outbreaks and treatment of RVF patients. however, neither safe and effective vaccines nor efficient treatment is available. in this review, we will describe clinical and pathological findings of RVF in humans and animals. some patients may have a long-lasting high fever for as much as 10 days. in the convalescence phase, patients often experience weakness, malaise, a tendency to sweat, frequent headaches, pain on motion of the eye, and a sense of imbalance. the patient recovered after treatment with amantadine, rifampicin, and dexamethasone. the patient had a fever, ataxic gait, and bilateral retinal hemorrhage. the patient had persistent hemiparesis for four months after the onset of illness. the affected eyes had macular edema with or without retinal hemorrhage, vasculitis, infarction or vitreous haze. retinal detachment [35,36], uveitis [38,39], or arterial occlusion [35,36,39\u201341] was reported in some patients. some patients show partial improvement in vision after several months of RVFV infection. postmortem examination shows diffuse necrosis of hepatocytes. it may indicate association with acute hepatic injury in this type of pathogenesis. a group of RVF patients who died from typical hemorrhagic fever also had encephalitis. a potential vertical infection of RVFV concerned a pregnant woman. no increases in the total number of abortions were seen during an RVF outbreak. it is possible that a vertical transmission in utero might have occurred. inbred strains of same name have different susceptibility to RVFV. age-dependent difference in susceptibility Hamster Highly susceptible to RVFV Similar pathological change to those seen in mice. most of the mice infected with wild-type (wt) RVFV ZH548 or ZH501 strains die in 3 to 5 days [50\u201352], whereas they die faster by infection with other wt isolates [6,53]. Occasionally, mice survive this stage, yet have hind limb paralysis at days 8\u20139 post infection (p.i.) and die from encephalitis [52]. infected hepatocytes are stained by using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL nick end labeling) antigens are not easily detectable in endothelial cells or Kuppfer cells, which indicate that these cells are not the primary targets of RVFV. apoptosis of lymphocytes was found in the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. a sharp decrease in viral antigens occurred at 8 days p.i. in some mice that survived acute viral hepatitis, a sharp decrease in viral antigens occurred at 8 days p.i. resistant Lewis rats were immunosuppressed by treating animals with cyclophosphamide 1 day prior to s.c. RVFV infection resulted in death at around 5-to-7 days p.i. with increased viral titers in the serum, liver, spleen, brain, kidneys and adrenal gland. these data suggest that the Lewis rat encodes a gene(s) important for the resistant phenotype. hamster is one of the most susceptible rodents to RVFV. death occurs in 2 to 3 days p.i. after intraperitoneal inoculation with massive liver necrosis. infected hamsters die from encephalitis by day 11. intrarebral wt RVFV inoculation of 50 pfu into 10-week-old gerbils resulted in an efficient viral replication (107 pfu/g) in the brain. the mean time to death was six days, which is not statistically different from that of 4-week-old gerbils. rhesus macaques were experimentally infected with a wt RVFV ZH501 strain. three out of 15 rhesus macaques were ill; two became moribund and were euthanized on days 7 and 3. one recovered from illness, while the other showed temporal viremia. no surviving monkeys developed signs of encephalitis or retinal complications in follow-up observations at two months to two years. three species of african monkey, i.e., the green guenon (Cercopithecus callitrichus), the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus fuliginosus) and the Patas guenon (Erythrocebus patas), did not exhibit any febrile reaction after inoculation of bney et al. originally reported an outbreak of RVF in a herd of sheep in 1930, which was characterized as a high rate of abortion in pregnant ewes. sheep with more than one week old were relatively resistant to RVFV infection, yet did exhibit fever (39 to 40 \u00b0C), viremia, diarrhea, nasal discharge, and decreased activity. inconsistency of symptoms and mortality in adult sheep described in these publications suggest divergence of host genetic background affects susceptibility to RVFV infection. insufficient immunogenicity of inactivated RVFV vaccines or residual virulence of live-attenuated vaccines induced fetal malformations. inactivated RVFV vaccine induced an insufficient immunity for sheep. pregnant ewes inoculated with live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain at 28 to 56 days of gestation either miscarried or produced lambs showing teratogenic effects. ewes vaccinated at 15 days of gestation with a RVFV Clone 13 strain, which has a 69% in-frame deletion of NSs, did not cause abortion or fetal malformations. necrosis of hepatocytes (24\u201333 h p.i.) and extensive hepatocyte necrosis (48\u201351 h p.i.) with a progressive increase in viral antigens. no viral antigens could be detected in the endothelial or Kupffer cells in the liver, suggesting that hepatocytes are the primary target of RVFV. some patients develop neurological disorders, vision loss, hemorrhagic fever, or thrombosis. symptoms start abruptly with severe chills, malaise, dizziness, weakness, severe headache, nausea and/or sensation of fullness over the liver region. symptoms start abruptly with severe chills, malaise, dizziness, weakness, severe headache, nausea and/or sensation of fullness over the liver region. patients often experience weakness, malaise, a tendency to sweat, headaches, pain on motion of the eye, and a sense of imbalance. encephalitis has been demonstrated in the blood during the febrile period (3\u20134 days), whereas neutralizing antibody starts appearing around the 4th day of the onset of symptoms. the patient exhibited symptoms of sudden fever, rigor, and retro-orbital headache for two days. 12 RVF patients developed neurological signs and symptoms, including meningeal irritation, confusion, stupor and coma, hypersalivation, teeth-grinding, visual hallucinations, locked-in syndrome, and choreiform movement of upper limbs. patients noticed the loss of central vision or blurred eye occurring at various times after infection. patients noticed the loss of central vision or blurred eye occurring at various times after infection. hemorrhagic Fever Fatal RVF cases often involve hemorrhagic manifestations. most typically, the illness starts suddenly, and the patients experience fever, rigor, nausea, vomiting, headache, injected conjunctives, drowsiness, and/or body pains. in many cases, death occurs in 3 to 6 days after patients become symptomatic. the temperature of the patient fell to normal on the 4th day after the onset of symptoms. two papular areas of several centimeter in diameter were found on the patient\u2019s thigh and leg on the 5th day. the patient experienced phlebitis of the popliteal vein, followed by infarcts in the lungs on the 20th, 26th and 34th days. newborn baby presented with anti-RVFV IgM antibody. ALT/AST elevation, jaundice, extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. it is possible that a vertical transmission in utero might have occurred. the clinical symptoms of RVF vary among patients. no hemorrhagic fever No ocular diseases Limited research resources Gerbil Encephalitis with minimum liver diseases Useful for studying neuroinvasiveness No significant diseases except for Encephalitis Age-dependent difference in susceptibility. Less than 20% develop hemorrhagic fever Requirement of ABSL4 or BSL3+ space to keep monkeys Expensive adult sheep. some symptoms can be seen on the 3rd day, and the body temperature often decreases to a normal level by the 4th day after the onset of symptoms. within 1 to 3 days after the recovery of body temperature, some patients may develop a massive coronary thrombosis [26], persistent aching of legs for two weeks [4,22], or persistent abdominal discomfort for weeks [4]. the patient had a fever, ataxic gait, and bilateral retinal hemorrhage. the patient recovered after treatment with amantadine, rifampicin, and dexamethasone for two weeks. the patient had persistent hemiparesis for four months after onset of illness. patients noticed the loss of central vision or blurred eye occurring at various times after infection. the affected eyes had macular edema with exudates containing a white mass covering the macular area with or without retinal hemorrhage, vasculitis, infarction or vitreous haze. in many cases, a complete recovery of vision does not occur. alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduction of platelet count and hemoglobin are seen in these patients. in many cases, death occurs in 3 to 6 days after patients become symptomatic. in some cases, death occurs in 12 to 17 days after onset of symptoms. the liver of the patient was normal, did not contain infectious RVFV. there was a large thrombus in the inferior vena cava, a part of which might have detached and caused an embolus in the pulmonary artery. the neutralizing antibody showed up on the 6th day of illness, and its titer increased toward the 12th day. model Advantages Disadvantages Mouse Highly susceptible to RVFV Infected mice usually die in 2 weeks, and are suitable for RVFV challenge study Acute hepatitis and lethal meningoencephalitis at late stage Cost-effective No hemorrhagic fever No ocular diseases Rat Varied susceptibility among inbred strains Suitable for studying host genes responsible for RVFV-resistant phenotype. mice infected with wild-type (wt) RVFV ZH548 or ZH501 strains die in 3 to 5 days [50\u201352], whereas mice die faster by infection with other wt isolates. clotting time of blood derived from RVFV-infected mice is significantly extended. infected hepatocytes in mice contain eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies [6,52], which are not reactive to the Feulgen reaction, a nucleic acid stain. infected hepatocytes are stained by using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL nick end labeling) assay. no viral antigens were reported in any ocular structure, including the retina. apoptosis of lymphocytes were found in the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. in some mice that survived acute viral hepatitis, a sharp decrease in viral antigens occurred at 8 days p.i., and no virus could be detected in the sera, liver, lung, pancreas, large lesions were mainly in the brain and spinal cord and characterized as mild-to-severe necrotizing encephalitis and encephalomyelitis with focal necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrate and perivascular cuffing primarily with lymphocytes. in the ACI and Maax strains, viruses were undetectable in the liver and blood. 5-to-6 log pfu/g of viruses could be detected from brain tissue. the albino rat of the Glaxo strain had an age-dependent susceptibility to RVFV via the i.p. route infection. rats younger than 15 days died in 2 to 4 days with extensive liver necrosis. 26-day-old rats survived RVFV infection. most of the 3- to 5-week-old gerbils died after 107 pfu s.c. inoculation of ZH501 from encephalitis. 90% of 7-week-old gerbils were able to survive the infection. rhesus macaques were experimentally infected with a wt RVFV ZH501 strain. tranasal inoculations, body temperatures increased to 39\u201340 \u00b0C at 1 to 4 days p.i. and the febrile period lasted for 24 to 120 h. some infected animals did not show any febrile reactions. 1 105 pfu ZH501 strain into 17 rhesus macaques, three developed hemorrhagic fever, seven were clinically ill but survived, and the other seven survived without clinical signs. no surviving monkeys developed signs of encephalitis or retinal complications in follow-up observations at two months to two years. papio Anubis had viremia for 3 to 4 days without developing significant clinical signs. sheep daubney et al. originally reported an outbreak of RVF in a herd of sheep in 1930, which was characterized as a high rate of abortion in pregnant ewes and high mortality of newborn lambs. inconsistency of symptoms and mortality in adult sheep suggests divergence of host genetic background, even within same breed of sheep, affects susceptibility to RVFV infection. insufficient immunogenicity of inactivated RVFV vaccines or residual virulence of live-attenuated vaccines induced fetal malformations. one out of 50 ewes and one out of eight unvaccinated ewes died. a live-attenuated Smithburn vaccine strain at 42 to 74 days of pregnancy could cause teratogenic effects in the fetus. two out of six lambs from the nine vaccinated ewes showed such effects. ewes inoculated with live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain at 28 to 56 days of gestation either miscarried or produced lambs showing teratogenic effects. studies of experimental infection of 1-4 day-old lambs with RVFV via s.c. resulted in necrosis of isolated hepatocytes (12\u201318 h p.i.), focal coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes (24\u201333 h p.i.), and extensive hepatocyte necrosis (48\u201351 h p.i.) no viral antigens could be detected in the endothelial or Kupffer cells RVFV virions bind to an unidentified cellular receptor, and enter the cells in a pH-dependent manner [94], probably through a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. both N mRNA and NSs mRNA are transcribed during primary transcription as early as 40 min after infection from an efficiently packaged, viral-sense (negative-sense) S-segment and anti-viral-sense (positive-sense) S- the three different RNA segments could be co-packaged in a coordinated manner. the co-packaging of M and S-segments could support the packaging of the L-segment. the RVFV virion surface is highly symmetric T = 12 icosahedral lattice. NSs, 78 kD protein and NSm are dispensable for viral replication in cell cultures. a recombinant RVFV ZH501 strain lacking both 78 kD and NSm induced acute fatal hepatic disease. NSm protein suppresses apoptosis in cultured cells. a RVFV C13 strain has a 69% in-frame deletion of NSs. NSs inhibits the synthesis of IFN- mRNA under conditions that transcription factors, such as IRF-3, NF-B and activator protein (AP)-1, are activated in wt RVFV ZH548-infected cells. wt RVFV NSs induces host general transcription suppression. it is also uncertain whether the general host transcriptional suppression is required for the inhibition of host RNA synthesis. PKR is one of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and plays an important role in inhibiting viral replication in vivo. other RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza virus, replicate more efficiently in mice lacking PKR than in those with an intact PKR. the RVFV MP-12 strain is a highly attenuated strain derived from wt RVFV ZH548 [133] and encodes a functional NSs gene. mutations in the M- and L-segments are major determinants of MP-12 attenuation. the C13 strain encodes an S-segment lacking a functional NSs gene. rZH501-M847G replicated less efficiently than rZH501-M847A in infected mice. the rZH501-M847G replicated less efficiently than rZH501-M847A in infected mice. the mechanism of the Gn mutation in the pathogenesis remains unknown. both N mRNA and NSs mRNA are transcribed during primary transcription as early as 40 min after infection from an efficiently packaged, viral-sense (negative-sense) S-segment and anti-viral-sense (positive-sense) S-segment. the packaging mechanism of RVFV RNP and the presence of specific cis-signals in the genomic RNA are not known. the RVFV M-segment encodes 78 kD, NSm, Gn and Gc proteins in M mRNA. those proteins are synthesized from a single open reading frame of M mRNA at different AUGs present at the 5\u2032 region of M mRNA. NSm is synthesized from the 2nd AUG, and the C-terminus is generated by cleavage at the N-terminus of Gn. a recombinant RVFV MP-12 lacking the expression of both 78 kD and NSm induced more extensive apoptosis than did MP-12 in cultured cells. the expression of NSm significantly inhibited the cleavage of caspase-8 and -9 induced by staurosporine. NSm may suppress apoptosis in infected hosts and affects viral pathogenicity. recombinant ZH548 carrying a deletion at amino acid 210 to 230 of NSs cannot suppress the IFN- mRNA synthesis. the inability of C13 NSs to suppress IFN- expression may have been due to its poor accumulation in infected cells. wt RVFV NSs also induced PKR degradation in mice lacking PKR. PKR is one of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and plays an important role in inhibiting viral replication in vivo. RVFV NSs induces the shut-down of host transcription, including transcription of both type-I IFN and ISGs mRNAs. NSs also induces the degradation of PKR to prevent eIF2-mediated host and viral translational shut-off. wt RVFV ZH501 virus stock contains two major viral populations. rZH501-M847-A (Glu at aa.123 of Gn protein) and rZH501-M847-G (Gly at the corresponding site) the difference in the amino acid is mapped within one of the neutralizing epitopes in Gn protein. mice immunized with virus-like particles containing N have a higher survival rate (survival: 9/16) than those not containing N after lethal RVFV challenges. anti-N protein antibody is unlikely to neutralize RVFV, but these data may point to the involvement of cellular immune responses against N protein for RVFV protection. s.c. immunization, intraperitoneal (i.p.) immunization, and intraduodenal (i.d.) immunization resulted in survival rates of 97.5%, 100% and less than 20% respectively. fewer than 20% of mice immunized via s.c. or i.d. and about 50% of mice immunized via i.p. survived after aerosol route challenge of RVFV. both infection and release of RVFV occur in polarized epithelial cells. hepatocytes derived from resistant Lewis rat or susceptible WF rat are less permissive to RVFV infection than those derived from resistant Lewis rat or susceptible WF rat [66,157]. resistant WF/mol rats are resistant to RVFV after treatment of the cells with rat type-I IFN. the resistance induced by type-I IFN is not necessarily important for the host specific resistance seen in WF/mol rats. the 8-week-old mice show a delayed viremia, when compared to 4-week-old mice. peak viremia titers in the 8-week-old mice are 5- to 10-times lower than those in the 4-week-old mice. wt mice infected with PTV had a 100% mortality and high levels of IL-6 induction. STAT-1 is a key molecule in the IFN signaling pathway. it was reported that PTV replicated substantially better in the brains of STAT-1/ mice. also PTV titers in sera, spleens and livers were high. formalin-inactivated RVFV vaccine partially protected lethal RVFV aerosol exposure at 187 days post immunization. 11 out of 72 surviving rats developed encephalitis without clinical signs at 27-28 days post-challenge. three vaccinated rats challenged with RVFV aerosol developed uveitis. encephalitis prevented occurrence of hepatitis, but not multifocal encephalitis 151. immunization with inactivated vaccines via s.c. cannot prevent RVFV-induced diseases after aerosol challenge. it will be important to establish a reliable countermeasure against bioterrorism. peritoneal macrophages (PM) derived from resistant Lewis rat or susceptible WF rat were treated with 1.0 or 10 U of IFN. hepatocytes derived from susceptible Lewis/mol rats are resistant to RVFV. hepatocytes in those resistant inbred rats are under the control of a host factor. the knockout of Isg15 or Oasl2 mRNA expressions increased viral replication in MEF cells derived from resistant BALB/cByj mice. it is of interest to know whether the mice lacking Isg15 or Oasl2 genes are susceptible to RVFV. wt mice infected with PTV had a 100% mortality and high levels of IL-6 induction (yet no remarkable increase in TNF-) wt mice lacking TLR3 infected with PTV had increased survival rates, slightly earlier reduction of serum virus titers, and decreased levels of serum IL-6 [162]. a similar attenuation of virulence has been reported for west Nile virus infection in TLR3/ mice [163]. address these questions will have a substantial impact on understanding of RVF pathogenesis and development of anti-RVFV reagents."}
