RNA was incubated in the dark for 30 min in 50 l of a buffer containing 0.1 M Na-acetate (pH 5.2) and 0.01 M NaIO4. the oxidized RNA was subsequently subjected to -elimination by performing a treatment with aniline. qRT-PCR was performed with a QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit. cDNA synthesis was carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) one microgram of total cellular RNA, random hexamers (Invitrogen), deoxynucleoside triphosphate set lithium salt (Roche Applied Science) and RNaseOut recombinant RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen replication-incompetent RNA fragments of cp BVDV strain CP7 were transfectioned into MDBK cells. the 3\u2032 partner comprises the 22 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the ORF. the recombination partners overlap at a 141-nucleotide stretch corresponding to the 3\u2032-terminal 22 nucleotides of the ORF. NS5B gene and a complete 3\u2032 NTR of BVDV CP7 acts as a donor of cis-acting elements necessary for viral replication. neither of the two genomic fragments was capable of producing viable viral progeny when transfected individually into MDBK cells. however, after cotransfection of cells with both fragments, recombinant viruses emerged. the highest number of recombinants, i.e., emerged after application of 5 pmol (3 1012 molecules) from each of the two RNA fragments. after cotransfection of a 10-fold lower concentration of the RNA fragments, a 20-fold decrease in the number of detected recombinants (33, on average) was observed. recombination was extensively used for generation of replicating progeny viruses. a proportion of 50% ss nucleotides can be found within ss regions. a disproportionately high number of crossover sites was located in unpaired regions of the RNA molecules. the recombination sites are found downstream of dinucleotide AU or UU. the distribution of dinucleotides resembles the distribution of dinucleotides in the particular genome stretches. recombination sites are found downstream of dinucleotide AU or UU. a total of 21 sequences of these recombinants were analyzed. the 5\u2032 partner (carrying either a 3\u2032 OH or a 3\u2032 P) and the 3\u2032 partner (containing either a 5\u2032 PPP or a 5\u2032 OH) were cotransfected into bovine cells and the emergence of recombinant viruses was monitored by the appearance of cytopathic effects. sequence analysis of 20 of the recombinants revealed the presence of a complete 3\u2032 fragment in 80% of the recombinants. this demonstrates that the 5\u2032 hydroxyl significantly enforced the integration of the complete 3\u2032 fragment into the recombinant. the fragments are not drawn to scale. the recombination junctions of at least 20 independently emerged recombinants were determined. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 recombination partners are shown together with the localization of the recombination sites of recombinant viruses that emerged after cotransfection with the RNA genome fragments. inants are indicated with a black line, located downstream of the last nucleotide incorporated in the recombinant for the 5\u2032 partner and upstream of the first nucleotide included in the recombinant genome for the 3\u2032 partner. additional nontemplated nucleotides that were frequently found in the sequences of recombinants are indicated at the 3\u2032 end right to the vertical line. the RNA amounts of both the unmodified and modified 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments were determined at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48 h) posttransfection. the results of two independent analyses clearly demonstrated that neither the 5\u2032 nor the 3\u2032 modifications significantly affect RNA stability. the enhanced recombination is not due to increased stability of the transfected RNA fragments. the recombination partners overlap at a 141-nucleotide stretch corresponding to the 3\u2032-terminal 22 nucleotides of the ORF, followed by 119 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 NTR. the 3\u2032 partner comprises the genetic material of the 5\u2032 NTR with its essential internal ribosome entry site elements (17, 45) but provides only a truncated version lacking cis-acting elements indispensable for replication. overlapping 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments were used in a series of cotransfection experiments. one set of experiments was performed with a constant amount of the 3\u2032 fragment (5 pmol) and various amounts of the 5\u2032 fragment (5 pmol, 0.5 pmol, 0.05 pmol, 0.005 pmol), and the other set with a constant amount of the 5\u2032 fragment (5 pmol, 0.5 pmol, 0.05 pmol, 0.05 pmol, a 10-fold lower concentration (0.5 pmol) of the RNA fragments was observed. a 20-fold decrease in the number of detected recombinants was observed. a total of 40 recombinant genomes generated by cotransfection were characterized by RT-PCR. a disproportionately high number of crossover sites were located within ss regions. recombinants were analyzed regarding the dinucleotide composition upstream of the crossover site. the segments of the transfected 5\u2032 partner and 3\u2032 partner were overrepresented. RNA polymerases produce RNA molecules with 5\u2032 triphosphate (PPP) and 3\u2032 hydroxyl (OH) groups. breakage or ribonucleolytic cleavage of RNAs can result in generation of RNA fragments carrying 5\u2032 OH and 3\u2032 monophosphoryl (P) termini. the absolute number of generated recombinants was calculated on the basis of a dilution series of the transfected cells ranging from 101-fold up to 105-fold. a 14-fold increase in the number of generated infectious recombinants was detected if the 5\u2032 partner comprised a 3\u2032 P (Fig. 3B, panel II, and 4A) sequence analysis of 20 of the recombinants revealed the presence of a complete 3\u2032 fragment in 80% of the recombinants. this demonstrates that the 5\u2032 hydroxyl enforced the integration of the complete 3\u2032 fragment into the recombinant, as the cotransfected unmodified 5\u2032 partner exclusively recombined at internal sites. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 partners are shown together with the localization of the recombination sites of recombinant viruses that emerged after cotransfection with the RNA genome fragments. details of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 partners are described in the legend of Fig. 1. a 5\u2032 partner with a 3\u2032 monophosphoryl terminus was cotransfected with a 3\u2032 partner carrying a 5\u2032 hydroxyl. the impact on recombination frequency was distinctive: a 290-fold increase (Fig. 3B, panel IV, and 4C), combined with a full incorporation of the 5\u2032 as well as the 3\u2032 fragment in 80% of the 20 sequenced recombinants. the results of two independent analyses clearly demonstrated that neither the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 modifications significantly affect RNA stability. therefore, the enhanced recombination is not due to increased stability of the transfected RNA fragments. the results of our analyses show that the recombination frequency is determined by the amounts of both recombination partners and that RNA recombination preferentially occurs in single-stranded regions of the RNA molecules. the frequency and pattern of RNA recombination can be significantly influenced by modifications of terminal phosphate and hydroxyl groups of the participating RNA molecules. only 1.2 106 infectious, independently emerged viruses (45) were produced. the majority of recombination sites, namely, 69% (3\u2032 partner) and 77% (5\u2032 partner), was found in single-stranded regions of the RNA. recombinants generated in this study were further analyzed in terms of particular dinucleotide motifs present at the recombination sites. the situation of dinucleotides present at the recombination sites reflects the situation of dinucleotide distribution within the particular genome stretch. differences detected when a 3\u2032 P was present at the 5\u2032 partner and only a 3-fold increase upon dephosphorylation of the 5\u2032 nucleotide of the 3\u2032 partner. a strong activating effect of these modifications on the generation of recombinants could be detected. recombination occurs even after cotransfection of two overlapping pestivirus RNA genome fragments, neither of which encodes an intact RdRp (22). a complete integration of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 fragments was strongly promoted by the presence of 5\u2032 OH and 3\u2032 P termini. replicating RNA genomes can be reconstituted after cotransfection of pairs of overlapping RNA fragments via intermolecular template switching of a host polymerase. hepatitis delta virus RNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm and does not depend on a preexisting host polymerase. promoter-like elements for cellular polymerases have not been described in pestiviral genomes. future studies will focus on the role of endoribonucleases that are potentially involved in nonreplicative RNA recombination and the ligation reaction responsible for joining the RNA fragments."}
