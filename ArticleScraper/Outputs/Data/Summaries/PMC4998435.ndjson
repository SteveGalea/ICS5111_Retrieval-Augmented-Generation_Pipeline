{"summary": "uric acid is the final product of purine nucleotide metabolism in humans. this loss of uricase activity, the uric acid balance in the kidneys and lifestyle changes with eating habits are associated with a recent high prevalence of hyperuricemia. a higher serum uric acid (SUA) level may be a risk factor or biomarker for both renal and cardiovascular outcomes in a range of populations. a higher US level was found to be harmful in residual renal function,[23] endothelial dysfunction,[24] and cardiovascular events and mortality. however, most previous studies were retrospective, single-center trials with a single measurement from small population size. a lower US level may increase the mortality risk in patients with ESRD. a total of 4132 adult (age 18 years) ESRD patients were enrolled from 31 dialysis centers. we excluded patients who were initiated on dialysis within 3 months or had no available SUA level. the study was approved by the institutional review boards of each center. the SGA includes 6 subjective assessments: 5 based on the patient's history of weight change, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional impairment, and comorbidities. each assessment was given a score of 1 to 7, indicating well nourished (6\u20137), mild to moderately malnourished (3\u20136), and severely malnourished (1\u20132). differences between the TA-SUA groups were tested using the 2 test for categorical variables, and the analysis of variance t test for continuous variables. variables that showed a significant association (P 0.10) were entered into the multivariate stepwise linear regression models. the association between the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL and mortality in patients on dialysis may be a feature of malnutrition, we dissected this relationship according to the SGA, albumin level, and BMI. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and STATA, version 12.0. the dialysis duration was defined as the duration of time between the dialysis initiation date and the patient enrollment date. to exclude any medication effect on SUA levels, we gathered information about uricosuric and antiuricosuric drugs. we obtained concomitant use of aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockades. the primary outcome was all-cause mortality after enrollment. the dates on mortality and cause of death were reported within 1 month after the event. the causes of death were divided into 8 categories. a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve was plotted according to the 5 TA-SUA groups. we restratified participants into 2 groups of TA-SUA levels (TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL vs. 5.5 mg/dL) survival differences were compared by the log-rank test. the mean age was 56 13 years, with a median follow-up of 43.9 months. the TA-SUA level was slightly higher in men than in women. the TA-SUA level was slightly higher in men than in women. the TA-SUA level had a significant positive correlation with nutritional factors such as the BMI (regression coefficient [B] = 0.042, P = 0.091), SGA (B = 0.062, P = 0.014), serum phosphorus level (B = 0.107, P 0.001), and albumin level (B = 0.127, P 0.001). the highest TA-SUA group had a similar mortality rate to the middle 3 TA-SUA groups. but the lowest TA-SUA group had a steeply elevated mortality rate compared with the other 4 TA-SUA groups. patients with the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate compared with those with TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL. a similar trend was observed when divided into HD and PD groups. in patients on dialysis may be a feature of malnutrition, we dissected this relationship according to the SGA, albumin level, and BMI. the harmful effect of the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL level on all-cause mortality was more prominent in age 65 years group. a comparison of adjusted hazard ratios for the subgroups is presented by forest plot. a adjusted for age, sex, the dialysis type, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, calcium level, phosphorus level, albumin level, total cholesterol level, uric acid level, subjective global assessment, and DM for each subgroup. most of the time-averaged serum uric acid levels in men overlap with those in women. as the TA-SUA level decreased, the participants were older and more were women. patients with a lower TA-SUA level tended to have higher proportions of malnourishment. patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) were associated with lower TA-SUA levels. antiuricosuric drugs were significantly associated with the TA-SUA (B = 0.067, P = 0.002), while uricosuric drugs were not (B = 0.014, P = 0.517). the TA-SUA level was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. the lowest TA-SUA group has a significantly increased mortality rate compared with the other 4 TA-SUA groups. the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality even after adjustment for clinical covariates such as age, dialysis type, total Kt/V, BMI, SGA, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, TA-SUA, DM, hypertension, gout, uricosuric drugs, and antiuricosuric drugs. adjusted HR, 2.797; 95% CI, 1.335\u20135.861; P = 0.006; P for interaction = 0.746), overweight (BMI >23 kg/m2), normoalbuminemic (adjusted HR 3.003, 95% CI, 1.572\u20135.737; P = 0.001; P for interaction = 0.978), well-nourished (adjusted HR 2.665; 95% CI, 1.397\u2013 the TA-SUA level was easily affected by diet, efficiency of dialysis, and drugs. a lower TA-SUA level, especially the lowest, was independently associated with all-cause mortality over a median follow-up of 43.9 months. the relationship between the US level and mortality in those with ESRD has been explored in 5 HD cohorts[16,19,20,21,38] and 3 PD cohorts,[25,26,39]. a low US level may be harmful against mortality,[16,19,20,21,26] whereas others insisted that hyperuricemia increased mortality. level on elevated mortality was prominent in the well-nourished (on SGA), higher BMI, and higher serum albumin level group than each counterpart. this implies that both hyper- and hypouricemia can be associated with an increased mortality. the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL is associated with a higher mortality in ESRD patients. the TA-SUA 5.5 mg/dL is associated with a higher mortality in patients. the causal relationship is still obscure and further translational research should be warranted. authors acknowledge the investigators of the cohort study in south Korea."}
