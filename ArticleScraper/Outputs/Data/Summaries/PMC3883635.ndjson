{"summary": "p7 protein encoded by HCV is a small transmembrane (TM) protein 63 residues long. it is found at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. p7 is not necessary for RNA replication [1], it is essential for infectivity, assembly, and release of infectious virions. a model formed mostly of -helical domains has been reported in the literature. a non-tagged p7 showed cytoplasmic orientation for its C-terminus. a non-tagged p7 showed cytoplasmic orientation for its C-terminus, compatible with a form with only one TM domain. hypothesized that the conformation of p7 in these two cases is not the same. but that inhibition of the two activities must be based on a similar mechanism. we have used attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. the p7 gene was cloned into pTBMalE vector with MBP as fusion partner carrying a His-tag at the N-terminus, forming the construct His-MBP-FLAG-p7. an additional FLAG tag was added to p7 by insertional mutagenesis using an appropriate set of primers [27], forming the construct His-MBP-FLAG-p7. thawed cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.02 mg/ml benzonase for 10 min. the cells were lysed with a microfluidizer at 15 kPSI pressure. supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min. p7 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent A (water/TFA, 99.90.1, v/v) and solvent B (isopropanol/acetonitrile/TFA, 8019.90.1, v/v/v/v). p7 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent A (water/TFA, 99.90.1, v/v) and lyophilized. synthetic peptides p71-63, p71-26 and p727-63 were obtained by solid-phase synthesis using FMOC chemistry. the p7 protein from hepatitis C virus (HCV) used here has 63 amino acids. gel electrophoresis Standard SDS-PAGE was performed with DTT in 15% Tris-Glycine gel with TGS running buffer or in NuPAGE under non-reducing conditions. the standard SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie blue while the NuPAGE gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain or silver stain. p7 reconstitution was performed by solubilizing the protein in 30 mM 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), followed by mixing with DMPC lipids. the mixture was left at room temperature for 1 h, followed by detergent removal with Biobeads (BioRad) this last step was repeated three times in order to completely remove the detergent. liposomes were extruded with a 400 nm pore size membrane to get small unilamellar liposomes. liposomes were extruded with a protein stock in organic solvent (10 mg/ml solution) liposomes were extruded with a protein to a protein to lipid molar ratio of 150. ethanol, 1% v/v, and added to liposome solution at a final concentration of up to 100 M. the protein-lipid suspension was subsequently freeze-thawed, extruded, and separated from non-incorporated CF in the same manner described above. 0.1 mM KH2PO4 and 0.1 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0) over an Econo-Pac\u00ae 10 DG column (Biorad) the column was pre-equilibrated with weakly buffered external buffer and 2 ml of the same buffer was used to elute the liposome fraction from the column. the liposome fraction was then further diluted with weak external buffer to approximately 1\u20132 mg/ml prior the assay proteoliposomes were prepared by either the \u2018dyalisis\u2019 method after extrusion, or by the \u2018addition\u2019 method. liposome sample containing 50 g of p7 peptide was mixed with sucrose to 20% (w/v) and Na2CO3 to 0.1 M. the p7 gene was cloned into pTBMalE vector with MBP as fusion partner carrying a His-tag at the N-terminus, forming the construct His-MBP-FLAG-p7. for some experiments, an additional FLAG tag was added N-terminally to p7 by insertional mutagenesis using an appropriate set of primers. a high cell density strategy was employed by concentrating 4L of culture to 1L media to enhance expression level in minimal media. cells were harvested and resuspended in Ni2+-NTA binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. the fusion proteins were allowed to bind to the resin with gentle shaking at 4\u00b0C, overnight. expression and purification of p7 protein was done in a similar way for p7 protein. no detergent was added to the sample as it is a soluble protein. p7 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent A. synthetic peptides p71-63, p71-26 and p727-63 were obtained by solid-phase synthesis using FMOC chemistry. deprotection was done in 30% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) peptides were ligated in 8 M urea, 48 mM DPC, 20 mM TCEP, 90 mM MESNA (catalyzer) and 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. after 36 h, the HPLC chromatogram showed fragment A consumed by the reaction. amide II (N-H bending, centered at 1550 cm1) were obtained by peak integration from 1600 to 1700 cm1. no difference in band area was observed using other means of peak size estimation such as peak fitting and Fourier self-deconvolution. liposomes were extruded with a 400 nm pore size membrane to get small unilamellar liposomes. liposomes were then vortexed, freeze-thawed 3 times and extruded through a 400 nm membrane filter. liposome carboxyfluorescein (CF) release assay. liposome solution was diluted 5 with the buffer above and aliquoted to a microtiter plate. fluorescence values were read every minute for 40 min. p7 was added to the liposome solution at a final concentration of up to 100 M. liposomes were formed with a strong buffer (60 mM KH2PO4, 60 mM K2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM KCl, pH 7.0) the external solution was exchanged to a weaker buffer (190 mM Na2SO4, 0.1 mM KH2PO4 and 0.1 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0) in ethanol 5 minutes before initiation of the proton transport assay with HCl. for the duration of the experiment, the solution was constantly stirred. liposome flotation assay In the flotation assay, proteoliposomes were prepared by either the \u2018dyalisis\u2019 method after extrusion. the p7 and sucrose buffer density was calculated using SEDNTERP [30] for the calculation of PAESC lipid area, the egg yolk PC area was used as a reference [31] in our experiments we have used essentially tag-free p7, either synthetic or recombinant. the fusion protein 6His-MBP-p7 was expressed at moderate levels after IPTG induction. the protein was purified by RP-HPLC using an isopropanol gradient. p7 was first solubilized in either methanol (M) or HFIP (H), to test the effects of these solvents on p7 conformation. amide I spectrum showed that most of the protein is -helical (trace H in Fig. 3A, henceforth referred to as form A), with a peak centered at 1658 cm1. a double-charged peak also appears at half the expected mass. this -helical content is consistent with the reported 62% obtained for recombinant p7 in DHPC micelles [14], the 70% obtained for synthetic p7 dissolved in 50% TFE [12], and a recent NMR structure of a p7 variant in DPC micelles [20], which is mostly -helical and roughly consistent with an -helical hairpin model with two -helical TM domains. this corresponds to 37 residues forming - direct method When we used the direct method of reconstitution, i.e., without a detergent solubilization step, results were identical to the dialysis method. samples dried from methanol (M) formed 40% -structure (Fig. 3B, curve 1), whereas those exposed to HFIP (H) were mostly -helical (data not shown) but when that sample was subsequently vortexed, freeze-thawed, sonicated and repeatedly extruded HFIP or methanol solution show no differences, with a high (70%) percentage of helical structure. this -structure is retained even after reconstitution in lipids, unless the sample is extruded repeatedly afterwards. this also explains that when added to preformed liposomes, p7 adopts -structure regardless of the solvent used. in both samples, p7 was found in both fractions LIP and PEL. a substantial part of the protein appeared as aggregates. the presence of high oligomeric forms may be due to the TCA precipitation. a considerable fraction of p7 was also found in the PEL fraction. this suggests that the PEL fraction is not merely protein precipitate, but it must also contain lipid. liposomes were also present at the bottom of the tube in both samples. similar results were obtained in the PEL fraction for both conditions. the dyalisis/extruded sample is predominantly -helical. the dyalisis/extruded sample is predominantly -helical. p7 was incorporated into the liposomes by the dyalisis method after freeze-thaw and extrusion. fluorescence values were measured immediately (0 h) after removing excess CF and after one hour (1 h) liposome without p7 was used as control, and TX100 was added to measure total amount of CF incorporated. p7(27-63) is not the pore-lining sequence and forms the \u2018lipid facing\u2019 part of the molecule. p7(27-63) is not the pore-lining sequence and forms the \u2018lipid facing\u2019 part of the molecule. but after removing non-incorporated CF, no significant differences in fluorescence were observed. p7 permeabilizing domain CF release affected by mutations that change p7 conformation or liposome insertion. most of these mutants could form oligomers in detergent, and could insert in membranes. however, K33A/R35A was the least able to produce CF release. a successful ligation with differentially 13C labeled fragments would produce a hybrid sample. the synthetic peptide p7(1-26) was totally insoluble in TFE or in detergent. p7(1-26) produced a spectrum in the amide I consistent with 100% -structure. -helical TM domains produce sharp amide I bands in the infrared spectrum consistent with 100% -helix. infrared amide I region of (A) fragment p7(1-26), and its Fourier self deconvolved spectrum (B); C and D, same for fragment p7(27-63), are indicated as dotted and solid lines. the alkalinization of the external solution is measured after generation of a pH gradient and addition of valinomycin. first we tested if p7 dried from HFIP (p7H) or methanol (p7M) and reconstituted by the direct method after several extrusion cycles. after trying several lipid compositions, p7H was found to be more active in the mixture PAESC (PA/PE/PS/PC 5221 w/w) negative control, i.e., liposomes without p7; (B) proton transport mediated by recombinant p7. p7 was solubilized in HFIP (H) or methanol (M) and mixed with PAESC lipids. we tested if fragments encompassing TM1 and TM2 can transport protons to some extent. the total pH change 5 min after valinomycin addition was significantly larger for TM2 p7(27-63) than for TM1 p7(1-26) as part of the B form extends into the extramembrane domain, it is likely to participate in fusion events or membrane destabilization; (2) Form A has two TM domains, TM1 and TM2, separated by a loop, where TM2 lines the lumen of the channel. this is supported by the observed direct interaction between the inhibitor amantadine and TM2 leucines 51\u201357, which have been shown unequivocally to be part of a membrane inserted support for this arrangement is found in physico-chemical properties of TM1 and molecular dynamics simulations [16], [19], and the observed partial inhibition of p7 channel activity by Cu2+, but not by Mg2+ [17]. peptide TM1 p7(1-34) showed some channel activity that was probably non-specific, because inhibition data was not reported, and the peptide had not been purified [12]. the hepatitis B virus surface L-glycoprotein adopts different TM topologies, acting during virus assembly as a matrix-like protein, and in virus entry as a receptor-binding protein. p7-mediated localization of NS2 protein to sites of viral replication in lipid raft regions [9], or the transfer of HCV core protein to the ER, which depends on interaction between p7 and NS2. the sequence of recombinant p7 protein used in the present work is shown in Fig. 1A. the sequence for the synthetic peptide started at Met (residue \u20180\u2019, Fig. 1A) 80% cleavage was achieved in 4 h. p7 was purified by RP-HPLC using an isopropanol gradient. pooled fractions were lyophilized and the purity was assessed. amide I spectrum showed that most of the protein is -helical (trace H in Fig. 3A, henceforth referred to as form A), with a peak centered at 1658 cm1. similar differences were observed using a synthetic form of p7. a dramatic increase in -structure is observed when the protein was pre-solubilized and dried from a methanol solution. amide I region corresponding to recombinant p7 protein reconstituted into hydrated DMPC bilayers by the dialysis method. p7 protein was solubilized and dried from methanol (M, blue) or HFIP (H, red); p7 protein was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in the indicated solvents. addition method is used in dye release assays [24] where p7 formed a significant (40%) proportion of -structure regardless of the solvent used for p7 solubilization prior addition to liposomes: methanol, HFIP or TFE. the presence of structure in the dyalisis and addition samples when methanol was used may be explained by comparison to the spectra of the dry p7 from HFIP or methanol solution. bilayers, the amide I spectrum showed that most of the protein is -helical (trace H in Fig. 3A, henceforth referred to as form A), with a peak centered at 1658 cm1. similar differences were observed using a synthetic form of p7. thus, regardless of the sample origin, a dramatic increase in -structure is observed when the protein was pre-solubilized and dried from a methanol solution. amide I region corresponding to recombinant p7 protein reconstituted into hydrated DMPC bilayers by the dialysis method. same for a sample reconstituted by the direct method after drying from methanol (1), after freeze-thawing (2), after extrusion (3). addition method is used in dye release assays [24] where a small volume of solvent-solubilized p7 is added to preformed liposomes in aqueous buffer. p7 formed a significant (40%) proportion of -structure regardless of the solvent used for p7 solubilization prior addition to liposomes: methanol, HFIP or TFE. however, the CD spectra of p7 in HFIP or methanol solution a fraction of the p7 population inserted into membranes is well folded and -helical. the percentage of inserted protein using this \u2018addition\u2019 method has been previously reported to range from 10 to 50% using Western blot [24], [32] thus, we initially attempted to use a FLAG-p7 and detection by Western-Blot. however, the flagged construct did not elicit CF release using the addition method, even though it was purified in the same way as the fractions with increasing density are found: (LIP), fraction with expected liposome fraction and (PEL), the most dense fraction. sample loading was nominally 4 g (1) except in samples PEL and LIP, as indicated. a considerable fraction of p7 was also found in the PEL fraction. liposomes are 1.03 g/mL [35]\u2013[37], whereas the density of the three phases used in the sucrose gradient, 0, 10 and 20%, are 1.01548, 1.05534 and 1.09827 g/mL. liposomes should accumulate at the interface between 0 and 10% of sucrose. if incorporation is not homogeneous, the liposomes would be found in the 10% section. p7 solubilized in methanol, methanol or methanol was added to CF-loaded PAESC liposomes. aliquots of p7 in methanol were added to CF-loaded PAESC liposomes. fluorescence values were measured every minute. p7(27-63) and p7(1-26) cannot form an -helical hairpin or a native p7 structure. p7(27-63) corresponds to TM2 (more hydrophobic) and the extramembrane loop. more hydrophobic fragment p7(27-63) was as efficient as full length p7 in releasing CF, although less than melittin. if form A is responsible for CF release, we incorporated p7 into CF-containing PAESC liposomes by the dyalisis method, freeze-thawing and extrusion. but after removing non-incorporated CF, no significant differences were observed even 1 h after removing non-incorporated CF. kinetics of CF release were also similar to the addition of only methanol to the liposomes. a synthetic peptide corresponding to that loop, p7(F25-Y42), produced only -structure in presence of lipid bilayers. this stretch of amino acids was found to be the most efficient at disrupting liposome integrity. a successful ligation with differentially 13C labeled fragments would produce a hybrid sample. the difficulty in handling and purification of the N-terminal fragment of p7 has been reported previously for p7(1-34) [12] after solubilization in methanol and \u2018direct\u2019 reconstitution in DMPC liposomes, p7(1-26) produced a spectrum in the amide I consistent with 100% -structure. a high content (50%) in -structure was also observed when the peptide was previously solubilized in HFIP (Fig. 6, A TM1 may be more difficult to incorporate in lipid bilayers than TM2. TM2 has the appropriate length and hydrophobicity to constitute a'real' -helical TM. proton channel activity of p7 form A has been observed in mammalian cells. PACC and PAESC represent negative control, i.e., liposomes without p7. the total pH change 5 min after valinomycin addition (Fig. 7B) was significantly larger. influenza A M2 fragment (18-60), a \u2018classical\u2019 proton channel, was more efficient than p7 (pH5 min = 0.250.03), even at a protein to lipid ratio 9 times lower. the proton transport assay requires extrusion to produce unilamellar liposomes, and this inevitably converts form B to A. p7-TM2 fragment solubilized in HFIP prior mixing with lipids. interhelical loop and TM1 form predominantly -structure that may be partially inserted in the membrane. form A is not able to allow CF release, although it is able to transport protons (grey arrow) rimantadine is able to interact with both TM1 and TM2 when form B is present. the p7 sequence (subtype 5a, strain EUH1480) in that report is less than 50% identical to the sequence used here (1a, H77) p7(1-34) showed some channel activity that was probably non-specific. other reports were unable to measure channel activity for this peptide. p7(1-26) is not even -helical in presence of lipid bilayers. p7 interacts with other viral structural and non-structural proteins that are important to promote virus assembly and release [2], [51]\u2013[53]. p7 also interacts with other viral structural and non-structural proteins that are important to promote virus assembly and release [2], [51]\u2013[53]. p7 was incorporated by adding a 10 M methanol solution of the protein onto a previously formed lipid membrane seal. the p7 product remained inside the column and was eluted with isopropanol. the p7 product remained inside the column and was eluted with isopropanol. the calculated size of the last fraction (#13) was smaller. both sequences correspond to genotype 1b but to different strains, HCV-J (A) and J4 (B). the approximate regions that span TM1 and TM2 and the loop region that produced maximal membrane perturbation [38] are indicated."}
