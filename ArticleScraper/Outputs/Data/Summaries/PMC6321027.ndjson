{"summary": "autophagy is a catabolic process in which unwanted intracellular components are degraded to recycle nutrients for the regeneration of organelles and energy. a variety of stresses, including nutrient starvation, organelle damage, accumulation of unfolded proteins and pathogen infection, have been demonstrated to activate autophagy [3,4]. microbial infection activates autophagy, which degrades the invading microorganism and induces the innate immune response. autophagy is referred to as the \u201cself-digestion\u201d process in which eukaryotic cells sequester intracellular materials within double-membraned vesicle-like structures. autophagy involves the delivery of cytoplasmic components to lysosomes for degradation via autophagic vacuoles. autophagy was discovered in the mid-1950s by Christine de Duve, the 1974 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine. morphologically dense bodies represent double-membranous vesicle structures in which mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are engulfed [26,28,29]. in the late 1970s, several groups showed that deprivation of amino acids and growth factors can induce autophagy [30,31] macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy have been identified. macroautophagy undergoes a stepwise vacuole biogenesis process. microautophagy is an invagination and scission process of lysosomal membrane that directly engulfs the intracellular portions to the lumen of lysosomes for degradation. the newly synthesized PtdIn(3)P recruits the double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3)P-interacting (WIPI) family proteins to form the isolation membrane (IM)/phagophore. two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are required for the expansion and elongation of phagophore to form autophagosomes. sytaxin17 (STX17), the UV radiation resistance-associated (UVRAG), ATG14 and the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1 also participate in the maturation process of autolysosome. stepwise process of vacuole biogenesis in autophagy initiates with an intracellular membrane rearrangement promoting the emergence of an isolation membrane (IM)/phagophore. the suppression of mTOR induces translocation of the unc-51 like-kinase (ULK) complex. it is organized by ULK1/2, ATG13, RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1, also known as FIP200) and ATG101. the newly formed PtdIns(3)P recruits the double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3) the cleaved ATG8 family proteins are conjugated to PE via the catalytic cascade of ATG7 (E1) and ATG3 (E2). autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form mature autolysosomes. autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form mature autolysosomes. the binding of Rubicon to the PI3K protein complex inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion [79,96,97]. a further study highlights that ATG14L binds to syntaxin 17 (STX17) and synaptosome-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) binary complexes on the surface of autophagosomes, promoting STX17/SNAP29/vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8)-mediated autophagosome coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2 (Calcoco2, also known as NDP52), p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and optineurin (OPTN) contain the LC3-interacting regions (LIR) required for interaction with ATG8 family proteins. despite this, several potential ATG8-interacting motifs (AIMs) have been identified within ATGs and other cellular proteins. selective autophagy participates in the degradations of damaged mitochondria, injured lysosomes, damaged peroxisomes, stressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and infected pathogens within autophagic degradation. other cargos, including lipid droplets (LDs) ferritin, nuclei, ribosomes, protein aggregates can be selectively sequestrated by selective autophagy. se Parkin ubiquitinates the surface proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane [118,119,120,123,124,125], triggering the recognition of cargo receptors for the removal of mitochondria by autophagy. PINK1 specifically recruits Calcoco2/NDP52 and OPTN to mitochondria and subsequently induces the translocation of phagophore-generating factors, including DFCP1 and WIPI. selective autophagy also involves the clearance of protein aggregates through p62/SQSTM1 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated recognition of poly-ubiquitin chain on aggregated proteins. p62/SQSTM1 and p62/SQSTM1 are shown to cooperate with p62/SQSTM1. ophagy was recently identified as a new pathway for removing injured lysosomes via the concerted recruitment of galectin-3 and LC3 onto lysosomal membranes. this process also requires the phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1-, Calcoco2/NDP52- and OPTN-mediated recognition of ubiquitinated microbial proteins. this process also requires the phosphorylation of p62/SQS autophagy regulates cellular homeostasis via selectively removing harmful organelles from cells. autophagy also degrades infectious microbes and participates in regulating the immune response [5,6,183]. autophagy is activated by the suppression of mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase required for metabolic regulation. autophagy is activated by the repression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase required for metabolic regulation. nositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) complex (class III-PI3K, including Vps34/PI3KC3, Vps15, Beclin 1 and ATG14) is recruited to the ER-derived nucleation site, triggering the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). the newly formed PtdIns(3)P recruits the double-FYVE-containing autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form mature autolysosomes. autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form mature autolysosomes. the sequestrated materials are degraded and recycled for nutrients. the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1 (PLEKHM1) protein that contains an LC3-interacting motif has been shown to concomitantly interact with Rab7/HOPS and LC3. the detailed regulatory mechanism underlying the functional roles of ATGs at each step of autophagy requires further investigation. potential ATG8-interacting motifs (AIMs) and GABARAP-interacting motifs (GIMs) have been identified within ATGs and other cellular proteins. recently, the AIMs located within Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATG19 were shown to directly bind to ATG5, thus recruiting the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L complex to cargo and stimulating the PE conjugation of ATG8 for closure of the autophagosome. selective autophagy plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of intracellular organelles by degrading damaged organelles. selective elimination of organelles supplies recycled nutrients for the regeneration of mitochondria, peroxisomes, ER, lipid droplets (LDs), ribosomes, lysosomes and nuclei. major route for clearing damaged mitochondria originates from loss of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) cleavage by presenilin- several outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, such as FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1), BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L) and yeast ATG32, have been identified as new cargo receptors of mitophagy. the degradation of stressed ER by ER-phagy relies on the functions of yeast ATG39, ATG11 and ATG40 [147] and on the family with sequence similarity 134, member B (FAM134B) and reticulon family proteins. p62/SQSTM1 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated recognition of Lys63 (K63)-linked poly-ubiquitin chain on aggregated proteins. autophagy catabolizes LDs to maintain metabolic homeostasis [162,163] autophagy regulates the degradation of LDs via the 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation of perilipin 2. the newly identified cargo receptor of autophagy, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) interacts with ATG8 family proteins. this autophagy-mediated turnover of ferritin is termed autophagy regulates cellular homeostasis via selectively removing harmful organelles from cells. autophagy also degrades infectious microbes and participates in regulating the immune response [5,6,183]. HCV, a member of the Hepacivirus genus, is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis. at least 3% of the human population is infected by HCV worldwide. the four prevalent human pathogens DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV belong to the genus Flavivirus. the recently re-emerged ZIKV led to large outbreaks in south and central America from 2015\u20132016. the virulence of this re-emerged ZIKV strikingly increases the incidence rates of microcephaly in newborn infants and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults. this virus thus serves as another threat to public health worldwide [220,221,222]. studies have shown that the rate of HCC development is significantly reduced in patients who have achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) after DAA therapy are unexpectedly increased [241,242], possibly due to uncontrolled liver immunity resulting from the DAA-mediated eradication of HCV-specific T cells. the emergence of resistance to DAA drugs is still conflicting. the entry of HCV into hepatocytes relies on several cell surface molecules. the lipoprotein-binding proteins, proteoglycan and leptin-binding protein located on the surface of hepatocytes bind to SCARB1 and CD81 via interactions with the E1 and E2 structural proteins. the development of HCV-related liver diseases is a complicated, long-term process that has not been completely elucidated. most HCV infections are persistent and 2030% of chronically infected patients develop liver steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis [279,280,281,282]. four major serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4) have been identified. clinical symptoms range from subclinical infection to dengue fever (DF) to the most severe forms, severe DHF and DSS, threaten the lives of some DENV-infected patients. the viral genome contains an ORF that encodes three structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane (prM) and seven NS proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). the E protein harbors the membrane fusion ability to help virions attach to the host cell surface, interact with entry factors and assemble viral particles. destabilizes ER-derived membranous structure and LDs for virion assembly. elucidation of DENV-induced host cellular responses urgently needed to delineate pathogenesis of DENV-associated diseases. the viral RNA can be translated into an 3400 amino acid polypeptide precursor. it relies on virion attachment and interactions of the E protein with entry factors on the host cell surface. the entry of JEV into a wide spectrum of susceptible cells requires several host molecules, including glucoaminoglycans. WNV is a human pathogen that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality [210,350,352]. the viral genome comprises positive-sense ssRNA that is 11 Kb in length. a vaccine for WNV intervention remains in development. the viral RNA genome contains UTRs at the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-termini and an ORF. the viral RNA can be used as a template for translation of a polypeptide that is further cleaved by host and viral proteases into three structural proteins. the NS proteins are responsible for viral RNA replication, viral-encoded nascent polypeptide processing and modulating the host cellular response. hepatitis C Virus (HCV) HCV was first discovered to be the infectious agent underlying non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1975 [228] and the HCV viral RNA sequence was cloned in 1989 [229] seven isolates of HCV have been cloned and classified, including genotypes 1 through 7 and each genotype is further divided into an array of different subtypes. the rates of HCC recurrence and de novo development of HCC in patients after DAA-induced SVRR are unexpectedly increased [241,242] possibly due to uncontrolled liver immunity resulting from the DAA-mediated eradication of HCV-specific T cells. the HCV viral genome comprises 9.6 Kb of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) that contains an open reading frame. lipoprotein-binding proteins, proteoglycan and leptin-binding proteins located on the surface of hepatocytes have been shown to facilitate the attachment of lipoprotein-associated HCV virions to the cell surface. viral particles bind to SCARB1 and CD81 via interactions with the E1 and E2 structural proteins [263,264,265]. the development of HCV-related liver diseases is a complicated, long-term process that has not been completely elucidated. the development of HCV-related liver diseases is a complicated, long-term process that has not been completely elucidated. most deNV primary infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting. clinical symptoms ranging from subclinical infection to dengue fever (DF) to the most severe forms, severe DHF and DSS, threaten the lives of some DENV-infected patients. effective antiviral drugs that cure DENV infection and vaccinations against DENV infection are still unavailable and under developed. DENV infection of the host cell initiates with E protein-mediated receptor binding followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. the diverse molecules present on the cell surface, including HS [307], DC-SIGN [308,309], mannose receptor (MR) [310], the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor CD14 [311], the heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP90) [312], 78-k elucidation of DENV-induced host cellular responses urgently needed to delineate pathogenesis of DENV-associated diseases. acute encephalitis often causes persistent neurological damage and mental disorders, such as parkinsonian syndromes. the entry of JEV into a wide spectrum of susceptible cells requires several host molecules, including glucoaminoglycans (GAGs) [334,335,336], C-Type lectins [337,338,339,340], integrins [337,338,339,340], integrins [337,338,344], grp78 [345], CD14 [346] and the intermediate filament vimentin [347,3 cellular and viral proteases generate three structural proteins (capsid, prM and envelope E) and seven NS proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). the structural proteins confer the encapsidation of viral RNA to form a virion. NS proteins participate in replication of the viral genome [210,350,352]. NS proteins are responsible for viral RNA replication, viral-encoded nascent polypeptide processing and modulating the host cellular response. 1020% of infected patients develop flu-like symptoms 714 days after infection [14,15,198,209,221,367] the authors also showed that these virus-induced double-membraned bodies associate with virions. poliovirus infection induces autophagic process to support viral-induced membranous structure formation [382,383,384,385,386]. autophagy also contributes to the apoptosis of CD4+ T lymphocytes after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope proteins bind to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4) in infected cells. autophagy is also thought to mediate the recognition of ssRNA viruses and the production of IFN by plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR7. flavivirus infection also induces autophagy to trigger the xenophagy pathway and thus degrade infecting viruses. however, controversy and discrepancies exist among studies. we also discuss the molecular mechanism by which flaviviruses drive autophagy to promote their life cycle. Chisari\u2019s groups first analyzed the impact of cell culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc) on host autophagy in Huh7.5.1 cells. they first demonstrated that HCVcc JFH1 infection can induce the autophagy required for translation of the incoming viral RNA to establish virus infection. a recent study showed that HCV-induced autophagy degrades tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via p62/SQSTM1. these studies indicate that HCV-activated autophagy may suppress antiviral innate immunity to promote HCV replication [405,406,407,409]. hepatocellular carcinoma, Huh7 cells/Infection Induction of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion in the infected cells Increased formation of GFP-LC3-labeled-autophagosomes in the infected cells Reduced intracellular viral RNA level and extracellular amount of virion in the infected cells. hepatocellular carcinoma, Huh7 and Huh7.5.1 cells/Infection and transfection of replicon RNA Induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion by transfection of replicon RNA Reduced of replication of replicon viral RNA in infected cells by knockdown of LC3 and ATG7 Colocalization of NS5A and NS5B with autophagosome. some in infected cells Co-immunoprecipitation of the replication complex with autophagosomes in infected cells Promotion on viral RNA replication Support on the organization of replication complex for viral RNA Ferraris et al. in replicon cells Promotion on viral RNA replication Support on recruitment of lipid rafts for viral RNA replication Kim et al.

NS5A, NS5B and HCV viral RNA colocalized with GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes by IF analysis. a biochemical fraction study showed that HCV infection triggers the translocation of lipid rafts to autophagosomes to promote viral replication. the results coincide with those of other studies showing that HCV-triggered autophagic vacuoles do not colocalize with HCV replication complex components. replicon RNA interferes with autophagy maturation and impedes the secretion of cathepsin upon autolysosome maturation [418]. inhibition of the HCV Con1 replicon-induced autophagosome by ectopically expressing ATG4BC47A, a mutant that inhibits the lipidation of ATG8 family proteins, results in severe cytoplasmic vacuolation. uPR inhibitors have been shown to suppress HCV viral RNA replication and viral-induced autophagy [438] Wang et al. also reported that the HCV core protein triggers the UPR to upregulate DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 protein (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) expression. DDIT3, also known as CHOP, consequentially upregulates the transcription of LC3B and ATG5 to activate autophagy. spliced forms of ATG10 can differentially modulate autophagic flux to regulate HCV replication. lipidated LC3 is oppositely correlated with clinical parameters related to steatosis in liver biopsies of chronic HCV-infected patients. autophagy promotes the degradation of LDs in HCV replicon cells. a recent study implied that HCV-induced IFN--inducible SCOTIN recruits NS5A to autolysosomes for degradation, thus restricting HCV replication. little is known about whether HCV indeed activates autophagy to regulate virus-host interactions in vivo. autophagy appears to degrade a panel of intracellular components, including LDs, mitochondria and host and viral proteins. however, these conclusions are largely debated to the previous study shown that HCV activates incomplete autophagy by inhibiting autophagic flux [402,418] p62/SQSTM1 is highly phosphorylated at serine 349 in the tumor tissues of HCC-positive patients. phosphorylated p62/SQSTM1 drives the glucoronate and glutathione synthesis pathways to enhance drug resistance and malignancy of liver cancer. a feasible animal model is urgently needed to uncover the impact of HCV-autophagy interactions on the progression of HCV-related liver diseases. deNV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection induces autophagy in infected Huh7 cells. the fact that genetically silencing ATG5 by RNA interference inhibited DENV replication implies the pro-viral effect of host autophagy on promoting DENV replication. the induction of autophagy by DENV infection was further confirmed by an in vivo study on DENV infection in mice. the inhibition of autophagy in DENV-infected mice represses viral replication and the induction of DENV-induced autophagy by rapamycin promotes disease progression. osome in the infected cells Transmission electron microscopy observation of autophagic vacuoles in the infected cells Inhibition of virus production by rapamycin (autophagy inhibitor) in the infected cells Reduced virus production in the infected cells by knockdown of ATG5 Promotion on viral RNA replication Lee et al. increased number of LDs in the infected cells by 3-methyladenine and knockdown of ATG12 and Beclin 1 Reduced virus replication by 3-methyladenine and knockdown of Beclin 1 in the infected cells Promotion on -oxidation of free fatty acids in the infected cells by autophagic degradation of LDs Promotion on viral RNA replication. increased intracellular and extracellular levels of viral particles by 3-methyladenine (autolysosome inhibitor) Colocalization of mannose-6-phosphate and LC3 with dsRNA within amphisome in the infected cells Support on viral RNA replication and translation Panyasrivanit et al.

NS1 protein Induction of autophagy by NS1 protein Impaired NS1-induced vascular leakage by inhibition of autophagy Promotion on disease pathogenesis. autophagy activates PERK and autophagy in infected cells. autophagy activates autophagy to facilitate the maturation of infectious particles. autophagy activated by DENV infection also alters cellular metabolism. this study demonstrated that DENV triggers the autophagic process all the way through autolysosome maturation in various types of cells to catabolize LDs to release FFA and generate ATP for the replication of DENV. another study demonstrated that DENV activates the AMPK-mTOR axis to promote lipophagy, thus promoting virus production. induction of autophagy by rapamycin enhances JEV replication. autophagy inhibitor 3-MA suppresses viral growth. lack of colocalization between dsRNA and LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles. diphenyleneiodonium, an antioxidant drug, represses JEV-activated autophagy by inhibiting the ER/UPR pathway to suppress JEV production in neuronal cells (Table 3) [485], highlighting that interfering with JEV-activated UPR and autophagy might be a therapeutic target for inhibiting JEV infection. this information could be obtained by investigating how JEV-activated autophagy induces autophagy and comprehensively understanding the detailed ization between mcherry-LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles and dsRNA replicating intermediate in the infected cells Facilitation on the virion entry and uncoating Li et al. lack of p62/SQSTM1 Promotion on viral RNA replication Tasaki et al.

WNV infection was shown to induce LC3 lipidation and formation of LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles in vero cells. loss of ATG5 and related autophagy by knockdown and knockout methods did not alter WNV replication in infected cells. this conclusion is further supported by other studies showing that depletion of ATG5 and ATG7 has no significant effect on the production of infectious particles. FP-LC3-labeled punctate structure in the infected cells Induction of autophagosomes fusion with lysosomes in the infected cells Inhibition of virus-induced autophagy by 3-methyladenine and wortmannin. no significant change of p62/SQSTM1 level by virus infection Reduced virus production by 3-methyladenine and wortmannin (inhibitors of initiating autophagy) human embryonic kidneys/SV40 large T antigen, HEK293T cells/Infection The kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey, Vero/Infection Human neuroblastoma, SK-N-SH cells/Infection Mouse embryonic fibroblast, wild type and ATG5 knockout cells/Infection Immunofluorescence detection of LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles Increased virus production by knockout of ATG5 Inhibited ZIKV NS4A and NS4B were demonstrated to induce autophagy in human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) by deregulating Akt-mTOR signaling (Table 5) [495] this Zika NS4A- and NS4B-mediated autophagy activation is required for ZIKV replication and the impaired neurogenesis of fNSCs. KV as well as the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced neonatal disorders continue to be elucidated. this information is urgently required for development of an effective anti-ZIKV drug for clinical use. escence detection of mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles in the infected cells Increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the infected cells Degradation of p62/SQSTM1 in the infected cells Abolished virus production of infected cells by rapamycin Inhibition of virus production in the infected cells by rapamycin Inhibition of virus studies have shown that HCV modulates autophagy to promote the viral life cycle and alter cellular signaling. serially passaging HCV genotype 1a (clone H77) in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) induces autophagic vacuole formation, as shown by TEM analysis. Ke and Chen demonstrated that HCVcc JFH1 infection induces the entire autophagic process throughout the formation of mature autolysosomes [405,406]. Moreover, interference with autophagy using gene silencing and pharmacological inhibitors strikingly inhibits HCV viral RNA replication. replication of infected cells increased formation of LC3-I to LC3-II. lack of enhancement of degradation of long-lived proteins in viral RNA-transfected cells. lack of enhancement of degradation of long-lived proteins in the viral RNA-transfected cells. reduced intracellular viral RNA level and extracellular amount of virion in infected cells by knockdown of ATG4B and Beclin 1 No apparent colocalization between NS proteins and autophagic vacuoles in infected cells Promotion on viral RNA replication Support on the translation of viral RNA Dreux et al. viral RNA replication Suppression of innate antiviral immunity Protection the infected cells from cell death Shrivastava et al.

intracellular amount of viral RNA in infected cells. this suggests that autophagy promotes the initial replication of nascent viral RNA by affecting NS5B polymerase activity and the NS4B-altered membranous web. this suggests that HCV-activated autophagy provides a resource for reconstituting the membrane compartment to replicate HCV viral RNA. these results coincide with those of other studies showing that HCV-triggered autophagic vacuoles do not colocalize with HCV replication complex components. the viral-induced autophagic process is not required for organization of the HCV viral RNA replication platform. autophagy was also shown to promote HCV virion assembly. this study mentioned the differential impacts of HCV viral RNA replication (Con 1b replicon) and infectious HCVccon autophagy. several HCV viral proteins have also been shown to induce autophagy. studies showed that HCV activates autophagy independent of the UPR. also showed that HCV induces autophagy by elevating Beclin 1 expression and activating mTOR signaling. ated LC3 is oppositely correlated with clinical parameters related to steatosis in liver biopsies of chronic HCV-infected patients. their study further demonstrated that autophagy promotes the degradation of LDs in HCV replicon cells [429], suggesting that HCV-activated autophagy catabolizes LDs to circumvent the HCV-induced excess of LD accumulation in infected cells. a recent study implied that HCV-induced SCOTIN recruits NS5A to autolysosomes for degradation, thus restricting HCV replication. together, these studies imply that HCV may utilize autophagy to counteract active viral replication and the host stress response by eliminating specific cargos. autophagy has emerged as a critical player in balancing lipid metabolism. autophagy controls the accumulation of bodily lipids and regulates adipocyte differentiation. autophagy has been negatively correlated with the clinical parameters of liver steatosis in liver specimens from HCV-infected patients. a recent study implied that p62/SQSTM1 is highly phosphorylated at serine 349 in the tumor tissues of HCC-positive patients. p62/SQSTM1 drives the glucoronate and glutathione synthesis pathways to enhance drug resistance and malignancy of liver cancer. a feasible and small animal model is urgently needed to uncover the impact of HCV-autophagy interactions on the progression of HCV-related liver diseases. et al. also reported that DENV-2 induces autophagy in viral-infected HepG2 cells. the colocalization of dsRNA, DENV NS1 and ribosomal protein L28 within LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles and the observation of mannose-6-phosphate receptor-enriched amphisomes suggest that DENV-induced autophagy machinery functions as a platform for DENV replication. induction of autophagy by DENV infection was further confirmed by an in vivo study on DENV infection in mice. the inhibition of autophagy in DENV-infected mice represses viral replication and the forwarded induction of DENV-induced autophagy by rapamycin promotes disease progression. a new idea in which autophagy plays a pro-viral role in DENV growth but also participates in the pathogenesis of DENV-associated diseases. rhesus monkey kidney, LLC-MK2 cells/Infection Human embryonic kidneys/SV40 large T antigen, HEK293T cells/Infection Increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the

modulation of autophagy in DENV-infected cells showed that DENV infection activates autophagy to facilitate the maturation of infectious particles. autophagy was shown to facilitate DENV infection via the ADE-mediated pathway (Table 2) [469] and to associate with DENV infectious particles to escape antibody neutralization and promote cell-to-cell transmission. DENV NS4A activates autophagy in a PI3K-dependent manner. NS1 and NS4B reportedly participate in DENV-induced autophagy. this promotes the degradation of LDs and viral-induced vascular leakage. the lack of colocalization between dsRNA and LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles suggests that viral-activated autophagy participates in the JEV entry process. a recent study reported that diphenyleneiodonium represses JEV-activated autophagy by inhibiting the ER/UPR pathway to suppress JEV production in neuronal cells. autophagy was shown to attenuate autophagy to promote viral replication via the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of Nedd4 and organization of the nonlipidated LC3-containing EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancer, mannosidase -like 1)-associated membrane. this information could be obtained by investigating how JEV-activated autophagy participates in the progression of neurological diseases. cells/Infection Human lung adenocarcinoma, A549 cells/Infection Transmission electron microscopy observation of autophagic vacuoles in the infected cells Immunofluorescence detection of GFP-LC3-labeled punctate structure in the infected cells Induction of autophagosome fusion with lysosome in the infected cells Downregulation of virus production in the infected cells by knockout of ATG5 and Beclin 1 Increased cell infected cells Increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the infected cells Colocalization of NS1 with LC3 in the infected cells Reduced virus replication by rapamycin (autophagy inducer) Reduced virus replication by knockdown of ATG5 and ATG7 Induction of autophagy by C, NS1 and NS3 proteins through immunity-related GTPases M (IRGM) virus infection was shown to induce LC3 lipidation and the formation of LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles in vero cells. the loss of ATG5 and related autophagy by knockdown and knockout methods, respectively, did not alter WNV replication in infected cells. TG5 and ATG7 have no significant effect on the production of WNV infectious particles (Table 4). these studies provided a mechanistic basis for developing an autophagy inducer, Tat-Beclin 1, to inhibit WNV replication and disease progression in WNV-infected mice. however, whether autophagy participates in the pathogenesis of WNV-associated neurological diseases remains unknown. production in infected cells depleted of ATG5 Promotion on viral RNA replication (specific by early stage of autophagy) production in the infected cells depleted of ATG5 Promotion on viral RNA replication. Enhanced autophagic flux virus infection Decreased virus production by knockout of ATG5 Inhibited viral replication in the infected Hela cells treated by autophagy inducer. recently, ZIKV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was shown to induce complete autophagy and thus promote p62/SQSTM1 degradation. these studies indicated that ZIKV-activated autophagy may participate in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-related diseases and suggest that the inhibition of ZIKV-induced autophagy may represent a therapeutic target for inhibiting ZIKV infection. microscopy observation of autophagosome in the infected cells Immunofluorescence detection of LC3-labeled punctate structure in the infected cells Inhibition of viral replication in the infected cells by 3-methylaadenine (autophagy inhibitor) Increase in virus replication in the infected cells by Torin1 (autophagy enhancer) Promotion on viral RNA replication Hamel et al. autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flaviviruses Infection Suppression of autophagy has been demonstrated to inhibit viral growth in most flavivirus-infected cells. autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flaviviruses Infection Suppression of autophagy has been demonstrated to inhibit viral growth in most flavivirus-infected cells. 3-MA increases the survival rate and mitigates the symptoms of DENV-infected mice [467,468] implying that autophagy inhibition can be used to control disease progress in DENV infection in vivo. chloroquine and bafilomycin-A1 also have an inhibitory effect on virus growth in HCV [497,499], DENV [500,501,502,503] and JEV [504,505]. autophagy inhibitors contain higher potency and lower cytotoxicity. the role of autophagy in flavivirus infection is context- and disease-dependent. future investigations are needed to understand the clinical relevance of autophagy and flavivirus. the lack of a feasible and conceivable mouse model hampers the development of a dynamic and timely assay for assessing flavivirus-induced autophagy in vivo. an innovative high-throughput screening strategy and bioinformatics analysis tools will improve the comprehensive understanding of autophagy-flavivirus interactions."}
