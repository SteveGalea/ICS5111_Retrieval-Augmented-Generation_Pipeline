{"summary": "SINV causes rash and arthritis in humans and causes acute encephalomyelitis in mice by infecting neurons (1, 2). a neuroadapted strain of SINV (NSV) causes paralysis and death of adult C57BL/6 mice. both direct T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity have been implicated in neuronal damage during acute infection (8, 10\u201313) glutamine is required for the synthesis of the primary excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. excess production can result in excitotoxic damage to neurons (19, 20) the availability and metabolism of glutamine could be a critical metabolic bottleneck that might be pharmacologically exploited. BHK cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (Pen), streptomycin (Strep) and 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen) primary lymphocytes were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, Pen-Strep, glutamine, and 50 M -mercaptoethanol (Sigma) mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 1,000 PFU NSV in 20 l of Hanks' balanced salt solution. mice were treated daily with 100 l of PBS, 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg of body weight of DON. blood was collected by cardiac puncture into serum separator tubes. cDNA (2.5 l) was analyzed by TaqMan reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. data were acquired on a 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) data from all samples were normalized to values for rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Applied Biosystems) sections were boiled in citrate buffer (10 mM citrate [pH 6] with 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min, cooled, and washed in PBS. sections were stained with antibodies against NSV (1:100, polyclonal) (2), CD3 (1:100, SP7 clone; Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature. mononuclear cells were isolated from brains and cervical lymph nodes. brains were homogenized in isotonic Percoll (9 parts Percoll [GE Healthcare] and 1 part 10 HBSS [Mediatech]. cells were disassociated by using a syringe piston. cells were resuspended in 400 l FACS buffer, and 50 l of CountBrite beads (Invitrogen) was added. a bromodeoxyuridine stock was prepared in PBS and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. s were stained with carboxyfluorescein succinyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) in PBS with 0.1% BSA for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, and then added at a density of 105 cells/well. cells were cultured in glutamine-free or complete medium (DMEM, 10% dialyzed FBS, 2 mM glutamine, nonessential amino acids [NEAAs], 25 mM HEPES) in the OD values from wells coated with uninfected BHK lysates were subtracted to obtain NSV-specific OD values. clarified 20% brain homogenates diluted 1:2 were assayed for IFN-, IFN- and IFN- (PBL Interferon Source) the glutamine antagonists DON (Sigma) and acivicin (ACI; Sigma) were solubilized in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to prepare 100 mM stock solutions. stock solutions were stored at 80\u00b0C, and fresh working solutions were made for each use. mice were deeply anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into serum separator tubes (BD Microtainer) mice were then perfused with ice-cold PBS. brain, spinal cord, and cervical lymph node tissues were collected. data were acquired on a 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) data from all samples were normalized to values for rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); fold induction was calculated relative to values for RNA from brains of uninfected mice. sections were washed with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and stained with antibodies against NSV (1:100, polyclonal) (2), CD3 (1:100, SP7 clone; Abcam), or NeuN (1:50; Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber. cells were stained with Aqua Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen) and washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 2 mM EDTA) cells were stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies against mouse CD3 (allophycocyanin [APC]-Cy7, 17A2 clone), CD45 (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC cells were stained with FITC-conjugated antibody to BrdU (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at RT, washed, and analyzed on a flow cytometer. CD3+ lymphocytes were purified from the spleens of uninfected adult C57BL/6J mice by using a pan T-cell Isolation kit. 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with lysates from BHK cells infected with NSV or uninfected BHK cells diluted in coating buffer. plates were washed with PBST, blocked with 10% FBS in PBST for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4\u00b0C. a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare BHK viral titers. a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS Glutamine antagonists protect mice from NSV-induced fatal paralysis. clinical scores were as follows: 0 for no clinical signs, 1 for mild weakness, 2 for paralysis of one hind limb, 3 for paralysis of both hind limbs, and 4 for death. median time of survival was 8 days, while DON-treated mice had median survival times of 14 days and 12 days (0.6 mg/kg) DMEM without glutamine, 1% dialyzed FBS, Pen-Strep, or complete medium containing the glutamine antagonist DON or ACI (100 M). Neither glutamine deprivation nor glutamine antagonists affected virus replication in vitro. DON treatment had no effect on peak viral replication, with similar viral titers in the brains and spinal cords of treated and untreated mice. untreated mice showed decreasing viral titers on day 5 and clearance by day 7 after DON treatment was stopped. mononuclear cells were isolated from brains of mice (n = 3/group) by percoll gradient centrifugation. numbers of CD45+ (A); CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ (B); and CD19+ (C) cells/brain were determined. analysis of H&E-stained brain and spinal cord sections showed less inflammation in DON-treated mice. sections from day 7 (treated and untreated) and day 13 (after treatment) were scored as follows: 0 for no inflammation, 1 for one or two occasional inflammatory foci, 2 for moderate to severe foci in >50% of 10 fields. a score of +1 was given for abundant cellularity. qRT-PCR for mRNAs of the T-cell-subtype-specific transcription factors T-bet (Th1), FoxP3 (Treg), RoRc- (Th17) and GATA3 (Th2) showed that all subsets were affected by DON treatment, with the most marked effect being seen on T-bet- and FoxP3-expressing cells. brains from DON-treated and PBS-treated mice were assayed for proinflammatory cytokine brains of DON-treated mice were examined for levels of innate and adaptive cytokine and chemokine mRNAs by qRT-PCR. mRNA levels of innate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12) mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. the appearance of IFN- in brain and antibody in serum coincident with the clearance of infectious virus in both PBS-treated and DON-treated mice. the appearance of IFN- in brain and antibody in serum was coincident with the clearance of infectious virus in both PBS-treated and DON-treated mice. superficial cervical lymph nodes from NSV-infected mice were harvested on day 5. cells were stained for CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19. there were fewer lymphocytes for all subsets in DON-treated mice. proliferating cells incorporate BrdU during the S phase of the cell cycle. cells were harvested 8 h after the second dose on day 5. DON-treated mice had a lower percentage of BrdU-positive T cells and B cells. anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and growth and proliferation were measured in the presence of DON and ACI and in the absence of glutamine. treatment with the glutamine antagonist DON or ACI did not affect cell viability. but treated cells failed to undergo even one round of division after stimulation. infected mice were treated daily from the time of infection through 7 days after infection with either PBS or DON (0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg) most PBS-treated mice showed signs of paralysis by day 6. all mice died by day 12 with a median time to death of 8 days. glutamine antagonists protect mice from NSV-induced fatal paralysis. median time of survival was 8 days for PBS-treated mice. DON-treated mice had median survival times of 14 days (0.3 mg/kg) and 12 days (0.6 mg/kg) data are pooled from results of 2 independent experiments. BHK cells were glutamine and serum starved for 24 h before infection with NSV. supernatant fluids were collected 24 h after infection and assayed for plaque formation. untreated mice showed decreasing viral titers on day 5 and clearance by day 7. untreated mice showed decreasing viral titers on day 5 and clearance by day 7. fewer leukocytes infiltrated brains of treated and untreated mice. isolated from brains of mice by Percoll gradient centrifugation. numbers of CD45+ (A); CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ (C) cells/brain were determined. analysis of H&E-stained brain and spinal cord sections showed less inflammation in DON-treated mice than in PBS-treated mice on day 7. gray shading under the x axis identifies the drug treatment period. Error bars represent standard errors of the means of data for three mice per time point per group. changes in inflammation and viral antigen after DON treatment is halted. DON-treated mice have lower levels of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in brain. brains from DON-treated and PBS-treated mice were assayed for proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10, TGF-, and IL-4) mRNA levels decreased to day 1 levels by day 7. levels of innate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12) mRNA levels of chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10). gray bar under the x axis represents the drug treatment period (day 0 through day 7) DON-treated mice have lower levels of IFN- mRNA and protein in the brain and lower levels of NSV-specific antibody in the serum during treatment. levels of NSV-specific IgG in serum measured by EIA from DON-treated (NSV + DON) and PBS-treated (NSV + DON) mice. the percentages of viable cells were similar to the proportions of CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, and CD19-positive cells. however, there were fewer lymphocytes for all subsets in DON-treated mice. superficial cervical lymph nodes from DON-treated mice were harvested on day 5. mice had a lower percentage (Fig. 9B) and number (Fig. 9C) of BrdU-positive T cells and B cells. the percentages (A and B) and absolute numbers (C) of total cells and CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes incorporating BrdU were determined. the profiles of DON- and ACI-treated stimulated lymphocytes were similar to those of glutamine-deprived stimulated lymphocytes and unstimulated lymphocytes. because the production of IL-2 is essential for lymphocyte growth in response to stimulation, the level of IL-2 was measured. mice that survived acute infection succumbed to NSV-induced fatal encephalomyelitis after treatment was stopped. this coincident with the appearance of the antiviral immune response, increased CNS inflammation, and virus clearance. glutamine antagonists have received little study for immune modulation of immunopathological diseases. T cells are the primary mediators of neuronal death in acute encephalomyelitis. neurotropic infections of the CNS can lead to glutamate excitotoxicity. treatment with AMPA receptor antagonists protects hippocampal neurons. glutamine deprivation and treatment with drugs that inhibit glutamine metabolism could also have a direct effect on virus replication. but we were unable to replicate these effects either in vitro or in vivo. the use of more specific inhibitors may offer a more specific, targeted, and less toxic way to treat neuroinflammatory disease."}
