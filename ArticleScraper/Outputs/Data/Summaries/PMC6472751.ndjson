{"summary": "conspiracy theories are broadly defined as a subset of false narratives in which the ultimate cause of an event is believed to be due to a malevolent plot by multiple agents secretly working together [1\u20132]. a large proportion of the population of some countries share such beliefs. in the past two decades, there has been increasing interest in psychological predictors and outcomes of endorsing conspiracy theories. sity and political extremism have been implicated to varying extents in conspiracy theories. the aforementioned literature has relied on self-reports of conspiracist beliefs. the belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) [12] is perhaps the most widely-used. bruder and colleagues subjected the five-item version of the measure to PAFA. the GCBS initially consisted of a pool of 75 items, but was reduced to 59 items. both the CMQ and GCBS have been translated into a handful of languages. -factor solution consisting general and extraterrestrial conspiracist items had poor fit to the data, as did the parent five-factor and one-factor models. however, inherent problems with the analytic strategy may have introduced problems with item content, functioning, and structure. there is a severe lack of cross-cultural data and evidence supporting the reliability and validity of these measures, particularly in non-Western cultures. the study of conspiracy theories in Iran is limited, but one early study by Zonis and Joseph [27] suggested that rapid social and cultural change in Iran meant that Iranians frequently resorted to conspiracy theories to account for new and contested realities. authors also speculated that child-rearing practices (e.g., the loss of dominant father figures) and the secrecy of sexuality in Iran heightened paranoid-like ideation. schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation were selected as appropriate for the estimation of construct validity based on established associations with conspiracist beliefs in previous studies. we hypothesized the scores on the aforementioned measures of conspiracy beliefs would be negatively and moderately-to-strongly correlated with education and analytical information processing style. a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories may be particularly charged in the Iranian context [28\u201330]. we undertook psychometric evaluations of Persian versions of the BCTI, CMQ, and GCBS (as the shortest and best-performing instruments described above) based on established associations with conspiracist beliefs. participants were recruited from the general population from public places in Tehran, Iran. participants ranged in age from 15 to 75 (M = 32.5, SD = 9.8 years) participants ranged in age from 15 to 75 (M = 32.5, SD = 9.8 years) more recently, Swami et al. [19] found fit indices of the one-dimensional model of CMQ to be poor in a U.S. sample. the 11-point scale was coded from 0 to 10. the 74-item SPQ was designed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) diagnostic criteria. each positive item indicates the presence of an SPD symptom. items were created to measure three dimensions of SPD: 8 items for cognitive-perceptual (i.e., ideas of reference, odd beliefs, magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, suspiciousness and paranoid ideation) the Persian translation of the SRR has been shown to have good convergent validity with longer religiosity measures in Iran. participants rated their affiliation with the rightist political party in Iran along a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Very liberal) to 7 (Very conservative) discarded items with low inter-item and item-total correlations, which resulted in 8 items for intuitive-experiential subscale (Cronbach\u2019s =.80) and 6 items for analytical-rational subscale (Cronbach\u2019s =.82). the number of factors to be extracted was determined by factor eigenvalues above 1.0 (the EGV1 criterion), examination of the scree-plot. parallel analysis creates random datasets with the same number of cases and variables as the actual dataset. factor loadings were interpreted using Tabachnick and Fidell\u2019s [50] recommendations. Cohen\u2019s d [54] was computed as a measure of effect size. effects are considered as large if differences are greater than 0.80. moderate if differences are between 0.50 and 0.80, and small if differences are between 0.20 and 0.50. all items were rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true) higher scores on this scale reflect greater endorsement of real-world conspiracy theories. items were rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Definitely not true) to 5 (Definitely true) higher scores on this scale reflect greater generic conspiracist ideation. the ISBQ has a two-factor structure: superstitious beliefs (5 items) and magical thinking (5 items) in the current study, the internal consistency coefficients were.80 and.74, for superstitious beliefs and magical thinking. the SRR is a single-item measure of religiosity. participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale, from 1 (Completely false) to 5 (Completely true) higher scores indicate stronger self-reported preference to use the respective thinking style. the 5-item CMQ had a one-dimensional structure using EFA. the fit was adequate in german- and english-speaking samples using CFA. the 11-point scale was coded from 0 to 10. the 74-item SPQ is a self-report measure of culture-specific supernatural thinking with 10 questions rated on a 4-point scale from 1 to 4. the ISBQ has a two-factor structure: superstitious beliefs (5 items) and magical thinking (5 items) the Persian translation of the SRR has been shown to have good convergent validity with longer religiosity measures in Iran. participants rated their affiliation with the rightist political party in Iran along a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Very liberal) to 7 (Very conservative) discarded items with low inter-item and item-total correlations. results were 8 items for intuitive-experiential subscale (Cronbach\u2019s =.80) and 6 items for analytical-rational subscale (Cronbach\u2019s =.82). the number of factors to be extracted was determined by factor eigenvalues above 1.0 (the EGV1 criterion), examination of the scree-plot, and where more than one factor was identified through rotation. parallel analysis creates random datasets with the same number of cases and variables as the actual dataset. Cohen\u2019s d [54] was computed as a measure of effect size. effects are considered as large if differences are greater than 0.80. moderate if differences are between 0.50 and 0.80. the two extracted factors explained 46.6% of the total item variance. only three items loaded on the second factor (loadings >.45). based on Tabachnick and Fidell\u2019s [50] recommendations, we eliminated cross-loading items. the Apollo moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio. area 51 in Nevada, US, is a secretive military base that contains hidden alien spacecraft and/or alien bodies. area 51 in Nevada, US, contains hidden alien spacecraft and/or alien bodies. the size of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy, KMO =.81, suggested that the CMQ items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity, 2(10) = 1289.37, p.001, indicated that the correlation matrix was factorable. the results of the PAFA revealed a single factor with = 3.25. the results of the PAFA revealed three factors with > 1.0 (6.02, 1.54, and 1.32) and the scree-plot showed a steep cut-off between the primary and secondary factors. the three extracted factors cumulatively explained 59.1% of the variance. the GCBS may have a single higher-order latent factor. the government permits or perpetrates acts of terrorism on its own soil, disguising its involvement. 3.44 (0.95).72.19.10 1.

Some UFO sightings and rumors are planned or staged in order to distract the public from real alien contact. Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy suggested that the BCTI items had adequate common variance for factor analysis (KMO =.89). the results of the PAFA revealed three factors with s larger than one (5.54, 1.44, and 1.21) but inspection of the scree plot suggested one primary factor and a steep cut-off to the secondary factor. the assassination of the president was not an accident, but rather an organized assassination by members of the British royal family who disliked her. 5.42 (2.32).62.03 11.

SARS (severe Acute Respiratory syndrome) was produced under laboratory conditions as a biological weapon. GCBS The GCBS items were examined for normality of distribution. the participants-to-item ratio was 36.3, which is much larger than the recommended minimum. the results of the PAFA revealed three factors with > 1.0 (6.02, 1.54, and 1.32) and the scree-plot showed a steep cut-off between the primary and secondary factors. the first factor (4 items) was labeled \u201cscientific conspiracies\u201d (Cronbach\u2019s =.80), and the third factor (3 items) was labeled \u201cextraterrestrial cover-up\u201d (Cronbach =.77) based on the parent study [22]. 3.31 (1.08).48.23.35 12.
