{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the united states. it accounts for 13.76 million office visits, 1.5 million emergency room visits and 726,000 hospitalizations annually. it is estimated that by 2020, it would become the 3rd leading cause of death in the us and worldwide. patients with moderate to severe COPD who experience more frequent exacerbations also experience a decline in FEV1 of 40 ml/yr in contrast to a decline of 32 ml/year among patients with infrequent exacerbations. it is now clear that exacerbations are a major contributor to the morbidity, costs and mortality associated with COPD. a wider definition from a consensus panel defines an exacerbation as an acute sustained worsening of the patients\u2019 condition from stable state. this definition is narrow in its scope and several important symptoms of exacerbation such as chest congestion, chest tightness, fatigue and sleep disturbance are not included. severity of an exacerbation is complicated concept because it is constituted by at least two factors, the severity of the underlying COPD and the acute change induced by the exacerbation itself. a patient who has got very severe underlying COPD may have significant clinical consequences from a relatively small change from his baseline state. a patient with mild COPD may be able to tolerate a much larger change in his symptoms and lung function. the association with benefit with antibiotics has not been reproduced in other studies. an exacerbation with mild dyspnea and mild increase in sputum would be regarded as the same severity in this classification as a marked increase in both symptoms. reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) correlated with decrease in dyspnea during recovery from exacerbation. decreases in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were proportional to recovery in FEV1. c-reactive protein (CRP), consistent with a heightened state of systemic inflammation have been described during exacerbations. noninfectious and infectious stimuli can induce an acute increase in airway inflammation in COPD, thereby causing the manifestations of exacerbation. environmental pollutants, such as PM-10, and nonparticulate gases, are capable of inducing inflammation in vitro and in vivo. PD Pathogen class Proportion of exacerbations Specific species Proportion of class of pathogens Bacteria 40%\u201350% Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae 30%\u201350% Streptococcus pneumoniae 15%\u201320% Moraxella catarrhalis 15%\u201320% Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae Isolated in very severe COPD, concomitant bronchiectasis, recurrent s in a patient with COPD, because of compromised lung defense, allows establishment of infection in the lower respiratory tract. acute bronchitis has more profound manifestations and serious clinical consequences. both host and pathogen factors are involved in development of acute bacterial exacerbations. the pathogenesis of acute viral exacerbations is less well understood. the rhinovirus demonstrates considerable antigenic variation among its more than 100 serotypes, allowing for recurrent infections. clinical success in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been defined as resolution of symptoms to baseline or improvement of symptoms to a degree that no further treatment is required. clinical improvement may reflect inadequate treatment, permitting the inflammatory process that underlies the exacerbation to persist for prolonged periods of time. nonclinical goals of treatment are either still in their infancy or only used in clinical studies to satisfy regulatory requirements for approval of new antibiotics. exacerbations are in many instances induced by infection, therefore eradication of the offending infectious pathogen should be a goal of treatment. the paucity of well-designed, large randomized controlled trials has undoubtedly contributed to the state of affairs (Sethi 2004b) epidemiologic studies have consistently identified certain \u2018risk factors\u2019, the presence of which in a patient with an acute exacerbation is predictive for failure of treatment or early relapse. failure was demonstrated, especially in moderate to severe exacerbations. the number needed to treat in severe exacerbations was only three patients. Diarrhea was the most frequently related adverse effect, with one episode per seven patients treated. in this trial, amoxicillin/clavunate was compared with placebo in 414 exacerbations in 369 patients with varying severity of underlying COPD. a unique feature of this study was the measurement of primary outcome at 5 days, instead of the traditional 2\u20133 weeks. 86.4% of patients, compared with 50.6% in the placebo arm. results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. differences in bacteriological eradication rates are seen, with an apparent dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes. this paradox is likely related to several short-comings in design of these trials. onset - Spontaneous resolution mitigates differences between arms - Clinically irrelevant as most decisions about antibiotic efficacy are made earlier Speed of resolution not measured Lack of long-term follow up not assessed Antibiotic resistance to agents with limited in vitro antimicrobial efficacy Diminished overall perceived efficacy of antibiotics Concurrent therapy not controlled Undetected bias in use of concurrent therapy. ifloxacin-treated patients remaining exacerbation free at 26 weeks. the relative risk reduction for recurrence of exacerbation was 30%. the rate of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in the 26 weeks was also lower in the gemifloxacin-treated patients. moxifloxacin therapy was associated with a superior clinical cure rate. a composite end-point of clinical failure, requirement of additional antibiotics and recurrence of exacerbation showed a clear difference between the two arms in the study. two meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials in exacerbations have been published. 93 patients with exacerbations of severe underlying COPD were randomly assigned to receive ofloxacin or placebo in a double blind manner. no systemic corticosteroids were administered. tracheo-bronchial aspirates were isolated in 61% of patients. ofloxacin resulted in a dramatic benefit when compared to placebo. increased mortality and the need for additional antibiotics by 17.5-fold. the benefit of antibiotics in mild exacerbations is unproven and warrants a placebo controlled trial. there are still important unresolved questions regarding the role of antibiotics in exacerbations. kinetic characteristics should show superiority in clinical outcomes. these trials are performed for regulatory approval of the drugs. these trials are designed for demonstrating noninferiority rather than differences between the two antibiotics. end of therapy and long-term outcome assessments were made at the conventional 10\u201314 day and 28 day time intervals. clinical success rates were 85.4% and 84.6% for gemifloxacin and clarithromycin respectively. clinical success rates were significantly higher with gemifloxacin (86.7%) compared to clarithromycin (73.1%) moxifloxacin and standard therapy were equivalent (88% vs 83%) when clinical success was compared at 7\u201310 days after the end of therapy. moxifloxacin was associated with fewer requirements for additional antibiotic therapy (8% vs 14%) and an extended time to the next exacerbation (131 versus 104 days) results of the GLOBE and MOSAIC trials demonstrate that in vitro microbiologic superiority of the fluoroquinolones does translating to greater in vivo effectiveness in treating patients with acute exacerbation. differences between antibiotics are often not perceptible with the standard regulatory end-point of clinical success at 7\u201314 days after the end of therapy. several of these characteristics are relevant to outcome in more than one study. these risk factors should be considered in the decision regarding choice of antibiotics when treating exacerbations. theoretically, patients at greater risk for poor outcome would have the greatest benefit from early aggressive antibiotic therapy. more than 3 exacerbations have been reported in the past 12 months. this has been best described for S pneumoniae among patients with community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia. this has been best described for this pathogen among patients with COPD. antibiotic choices for patients with uncomplicated COPD include an advanced macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin), a ketolide (telithromycin), a cephalosporin (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime or cefdinir), doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. in complicated patients, antibiotic choices include a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, a sputum (or tracheobronchial aspirate if intubated) culture should be obtained to allow adjustment of antibiotics based on the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens isolated. patients should be re-assessed at 48\u201372 hrs, in which time frame clinical improvement should be apparent. biomarkers of bacterial infection represent another approach to antibiotic use in exacerbations of COPD. best studied biomarker of bacterial infection is serum procalcitonin level. only a minority of patients received fluoroquinolones in this study. the overall cost of care could be reduced by half with only a 33% reduction in clinical failure rates. clinical failure rates are likely to be reduced when antibiotic choice is appropriate."}
