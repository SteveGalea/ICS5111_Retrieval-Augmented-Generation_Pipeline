{"summary": "vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) have been shown to exist in the mammalian eye in areas such as the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process, and the retina. mic tract12 and PACAP attenuates glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons. this suggests compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability and function. VIP and PACAP are likely to have an important role in retinal development. acute inflammation and BRB compromise occur in the early stages of the disease in these mice. autoimmune reactivity and neurodegeneration are features of the later stages of retinal disease. the significant contribution of cAMP function in the BRB suggests retinal pathologies could involve VN autoimmunity. a pathomechanism involving ATP toxicity may occur with potentially serious consequences. a pathomechanism involving ATP toxicity may occur from VN autoimmunity which impedes cAMP production while elevating ATP levels."}
