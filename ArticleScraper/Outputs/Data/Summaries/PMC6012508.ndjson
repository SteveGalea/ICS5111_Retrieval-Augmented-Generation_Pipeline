{"summary": "in recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of new mAbs with improved neutralizing activity (1\u201314) several mAbs directed against human cytomegalovirus, HIV, influenza, Ebola, and rabies virus are currently engaged in promising clinical trials (1, 3, 9, 14) erythroleukemia is a model system permitting extensive analysis of the endogenous immune response after passive mAb-based immunotherapy. a 5-day treatment of frCasE-infected mice with the neutralizing mAb 667 provides long-lasting (>1-year) antiviral immunity of the Th1 type. modulatory properties of neutrophils have been poorly studied in viral infections. we used the FrCasE model to address the general question of neutrophil participation in the induction of protective immunity by antiviral mAbs. findings should facilitate improved design of mAb-based antiviral therapies. eight-day-old pups were infected and treated with the 667 mAb as indicated. mice were treated as indicated with the anti-Ly6G 1A8 mAb or the isotype control 2A3 mAb. neutrophils were depleted by administering a mAb (1A8) directed to their specific Ly6G cell surface marker (37, 38) or an isotype control mAb (2A3) depletion started 1 day before infection, was efficient and specific. accelerated disease development in infected/nontreated mice. infected/treated mice were treated as indicated with the anti-Ly6G 1A8 mAb or the isotype control 2A3 mAb to deplete neutrophils. infected/treated mice were treated as indicated with the anti-asialo-GM1 antibody to deplete NK cells. NK cells depleted or not as indicated in A followed up for leukemic death. data represent 2 independent experiments, with 7 mice per group. NK cells control viral propagation in infected/treated mice. NK cells are crucial for the protection against leukemia in infected/treated mice. antibody-mediated control of viral propagation by NK cells is necessary for long-term antiviral protection. NK cells are a heterogeneous population of immune cells that includes NK cells and ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. NKp46+ cell mobilization in infected/nontreated mice but not in infected/treated or in naive mice. the recruitment of those ILCs in spleens of both infected/nontreated and infected/treated mice at day 14 p.i. was not significantly different from that observed in naive mice. neutrophil depletion did not significantly alter the frequency of such ILCs in any group of mice. the data represent at least 2 independent experiments. data are expressed as mean SEM. a parametric 1-way ANOVA test with a Bonferroni correction. these results show an enhanced recruitment of CD3\u2013NKp46+ cells. neutrophils affect ADCC activity of NK cells in infected/treated mice. ablation of neutrophils did not alter 667 mAb\u2013mediated ADCC activity of NK cells. neutrophils may participate in functional activation of CD3\u2013NKp46+ cells. naive, I/NT, and I/T mice were depleted or not. mAb-induced antiviral CD8+ T cells were isolated at day 14 p.i. infected/treated mice showed a much higher level of anti-FrCasE IgGs than infected/nontreated animals. in the absence of neutrophils, serum concentration of antiviral IgGs dramatically decreased in infected/treated mice. neutrophils showed no role in regulation of poor nonprotective antibody response in infected/treated mice. neutrophil depletion affects humoral immunity with an effect on both primary and memory virus-specific B cell responses. naive, I/NT, and I/T mice were depleted or not. ELISA data represent 2 independent experiments, with 5 mice per group. splenic MZ (CD21hiIgMhi CD19+ cells) and follicular (FO) (CD23+IgMlo CD19+ cells) B cells contribute to mounting of antibodies. tion in infected/treated mice led to smaller GCs. neutrophils are essential for the vaccine-like effects induced by the 667 mAb immunotherapy through. neutrophil-dependent increase in splenic MZ B cells and BM plasma cells. splenic neutrophils were similarly activated, as deduced from CD62L shedding. neutrophils from infected/treated mice showed a significantly stronger expression of two cytokines involved in B cell activation. FN-, 667 mAb triggering led to a significantly increased release of BAFF and LT by neutrophils. the data represent 5 independent experiments, with at least 18 mice per group. ELISA in supernatants of neutrophils isolated from BM of naive mice. experiments were done in the presence and in the absence of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN- (100 ng/ml) data represent 4 independent experiments. fected/nontreated mice were treated with the antineutrophil (1A8) or the control (2A3) mAb as indicated in A. naive mice were treated with either the antineutrophil (1A8) or the control (2A3) mAb. NT, and I/T mice were depleted, or not, as indicated in A and infected splenocytes were assayed as in C on day 8 p.i. data represent 4 independent experiments, with 9\u201315 mice per group. infected mice treated as indicated with anti-Ly6G 1A8 mAb or isotype control 2A3 mAb to deplete neutrophils. infected mice treated as indicated with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody to deplete NK cells. data are presented as mean SEM of 2 independent experiments, with at least 8 mice per group. effect of NK cell depletion in the survival of infected/treated mice. mAb-mediated ADCC activity of NK cells and neutrophils with infected splenocytes led to reduced mAb-mediated infected cell lysis. NK cells are crucial for viral propagation control during the immunotherapy period. NK cells are crucial for the protection against leukemia in infected mice. CD3\u2013NKp46+ cell recruitment in spleens of both infected/nontreated and infected/treated mice at day 14 p.i. was similar and stronger than in naive mice. neutrophils were involved in CD3\u2013NKp46+ cell mobilization in infected/nontreated mice. the 1A8, or the 2A3 isotype control mAb, was administered to I/T mice. 667 ADCC activity was quantified at 30 days p.i., as in Figure 2, C and D. neutrophils entailed a strong reduction of the frequency of CD11b+CD3\u2013NKp46+ cells only in infected/treated mice. further characterization of CD3\u2013NKp46+ cells indicated higher neutrophil-dependent IFN- production in infected/treated mice but low and similar IFN- levels in naive and infected/nontreated animals. treated mice showed increased virus-specific CD8+ T cell response relative to infected/nontreated mice. neither case was the frequency of virus-specific CD8+ T cells altered by neutrophil depletion. neutrophil depletion did not alter virus-specific IgM titers in either infected/nontreated or infected/treated mice. infected/treated mice showed a much higher level of anti-FrCasE IgGs than infected/nontreated animals. neutrophils showed no role in regulation of poor nonprotective antibody response elicited in infected/treated mice. d or not of neutrophils were inoculated with FrCasE. serum samples were collected 1 week later to assay the generation of endogenous anti-FrCasE antibodies. neutrophil depletion at early time points after infection and treatment affects humoral immunity. n = 8) and infected/treated (n = 9) mice, depleted or not of neutrophils, showed in Figure 1D were evaluated for such a correlation. the data represent 2 independent experiments, with 5 mice per group. histological analyses of spleens of infected mice at 14 days p.i. revealed larger germinal centers (GCs) in infected/treated versus infected/nontreated mice. neutrophil depletion in infected/treated mice led to smaller GCs. neutrophils are essential for the vaccine-like effects induced by the 667 mAb immunotherapy through the stimulation of the humoral, but not the CD8+ T cell, antiviral response. this effect is associated with a neutrophil-dependent increase in both splenic MZ B cells and BM plasma cells. we isolated BM neutrophils from naive mice and stimulated them for 24 hours in plates coated with the 667 mAb. inflammatory conditions could synergize with 667 mAb triggering. the data represent 5 independent experiments, with at least 18 mice per group. the dashed line represents the level of BAFF released by neutrophils sorted from naive mice. no LT release was detected from neutrophils sorted from naive mice. neutrophils are essential during the immunotherapy period for long-term survival of infected mice. this is not because they control viral propagation but because they are crucial for inducing a protective humoral response without an effect on the CD8+ T cell response. innate effector cells have distinct but complementary roles in the protection of infected mice by mAb. prone mice (52), during emergency granulopoiesis (53), and in bacterial infection (54). no modulation of the anti-FrCasE humoral response was detected in infected/nontreated mice upon neutrophil depletion. LT is involved in the formation of secondary lymphoid organs, is expressed by lymphocytes, and mediates a large variety of inflammatory and antiviral responses. this cytokine is expressed and released by neutrophils upon mAb treatment of infected mice. if combination therapies are considered, it will be of utmost importance that the agent(s) coadministered with the passive immunotherapy do not alter neutrophil functions and counts to avoid inhibiting efficient antiviral humoral immune responses. if combined therapies are considered, it will be of utmost importance that the agent(s) coadministered with the passive immunotherapy do not alter neutrophil functions and counts to avoid inhibiting efficient antiviral humoral immune responses. neutrophil activity, restoring impaired functions, and counteracting immunosuppressive actions should improve the vaccine-like effects of antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies. this might also apply to cancer treatment as enhancement of antitumoral immune responses has also been observed in mAb-based anticancer immunotherapies. cells were assayed using an anti-Gag mAb (H34) labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. forward scatter area and forward scatter time-of-flight were used to remove doublets from flow cytometry analyses. infected mice depleted or not of neutrophils were injected i.v. with 300 l of a 5 104 FFU/ml FrCasE suspension mixed to 2 106 FrCasE-infected splenocytes 3 months after the first infection.
