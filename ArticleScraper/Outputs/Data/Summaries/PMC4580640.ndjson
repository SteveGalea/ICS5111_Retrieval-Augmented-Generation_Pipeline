{"summary": "fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) as an index of stress, after validating the method for its application in wolves. we analyzed 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations. glucocorticoids (GCs) cortisol and corticosterone are front-line stress hormones. chronic high cortisol concentrations can cause neuronal cell death, muscle and bone atrophy, poor wound healing, as well as inhibition of growth and reproduction. study of stress in free-ranging populations is still emerging field of research. stressors identified in different mammals include anthropogenic disturbances [18,25\u201328], extreme temperatures [1,2], elevated population density [29\u201331], food limitation and infection by pathogens [8,32]. at the individual level, GCs secretion can vary with age, sex, reproductive status or body condition [1,2,13]. at the individual level, GCs secretion can vary with age, sex, reproductive status or body condition [1,2,13]. mating season takes place once a year during late winter. most males and females usually reach sexual maturity as yearlings. average of 4\u20136 pups are born in April-May, which greatly benefit from extended alloparental care by the pack members. no correlation between social status and GCs was found in a captive pack [58]. no correlation between social status and GCs was found in a captive pack [58], at least in some individuals [58]. wolf packs settled in all three national parks for at least 20 years. the three study areas are located at similar latitudes, share a mountainous backcountry, and are exposed to comparable seasonal climatic variations. wolf packs had settled in all three national parks for at least 20 years. moose, pronghorn antelope, big horn sheep, mountain goat. non-existent in yellowstone, pastoralism is important in abruzzo and Mercantour. snowmobiling is forbidden in all three areas. study area Wolf density a (ind./ 1000km) Main prey species b Prey base c Logging and hunting activities in part of the territory of the studied packs d Recovered dead wolves during years of study (p/c/n/u) wolf fecal samples collected in abruzzo and Mercantour were submitted to dietary analyses. main prey species were assessed through close monitoring of packs. cause of death: poaching / collision / natural (intraspecific strife)/ unknown. stray and feral dogs are absent from Yellowstone and very rare in Mercantour. an important free-ranging dog population lives sympatrically with wolves in abruzzo. wolves often relies on same food sources as wolves. study area Winter of sample collection Packs Number of individuals/pack a Number of collected fecal samples Abruzzo 2006\u20132007 Iorio 6 13 Orsara 3 19 Villavalelonga 7 20 Mainarde 9 27 Total 79 2007\u20132008 Iorio 4 10 Orsara 6 58 Villavalelonga 6 6 6 Mainarde 5 12 Total 86 Mercantour 2005\u20132006 Haute Tin\u00e9e 3\u20134 18 Moyenne Tin\u00e9e 2\u20133 12 V\u00e9subie- in abruzzo and Mercantour, most samples were collected within 24 to 48 hours following snowfalls while snow-tracking the studied packs. in abruzzo, multiple criteria were used to conservatively discriminate wolf scats from those of free-ranging dogs and foxes (Vulpes vulpes), among which scat size and absence of tracks from other canids. fecal samples stayed at or below freezing point from defecation to collection time. the same day, we visualized the recorded sequence on a computer. the next day, or as soon as possible in accordance with park regulations, we collected fecal samples. all samples were stored at -20\u00b0C in labeled plastic bags. we then hand-mixed each sample for 1 min through its plastic bag container. an aliquot was then processed by a cortisol enzyme immunoassay. fecal samples of each of the three individuals were collected within minutes after defecation and immediately stored in labeled plastic bags at -20\u00b0C until analysis. we coded pack territorial stability during the winters of sample collection as a dummy variable, where 1 = stable and 0 = unstable. mortality and dispersal rates were in a period of 12 months including sample collection, from April to March. a disperser from a neighboring pack filled the vacant breeding position. no pup survived in 2006 because of the siege of the pack's den site by an unknown pack at the onset of the denning period. the newly established blacktail deer plateau pack was founded in November 2008 by six male and four female dispersers. we removed the supernatant and dissolved the pellet in a few drops of saline. to obtain a stained preparation, we added a drop of 5 x diluted Lugol solution [91] to a drop of concentrated fecal solution. to observe unstained structures, we added a drop of saline to the concentrated fecal solution. we modeled FCM levels as a function of age-class (pup: one year old; yearling: one to two years old; adult: > two years old), sex, social status (highest ranking male and female, or subordinate), month of collection. we fitted a random intercept for individual identity nested in pack identity to control for pseudo-replication, and for winter of collection. we tested for a correlation between stress and parasite richness. we fitted mixed-models using the package lme4. no specific permission was required for the collection of fecal samples. study area National park establishment year Location and coordinates Mountain range Wolf presence / return a Wild ungulates Livestock Tourism Abruzzo 1923 Central Italy (41\u00b076' N;

Mercantour: based on snow-tracking sessions and genetic analyses performed on fecal samples. variations are due to dispersal and death. in summer and fall 2008, three yearlings and three adults died, likely in a disease outbreak. all fresh scats collected in Abruzzo from December 2005 to March 2006 were from wolves, except two samples from foxes. in Mercantour, systematic genetic analyses are performed on the samples to discriminate wolf scats from those of other species. wolves not belonging to the target pack were known to have used the area between scat production and collection time. we discarded fecal samples partly consumed by birds, since only homogenized intact samples can be considered due to the pulsatile secretion of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor. sensitivity was 0.3 ng/g, and intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 8.9% and 11.1% respectively. each sample was run in duplicate and results expressed as ng/g wet feces. the cortisol EIA was successfully validated for dogs. in 2007\u20132008, the Druid Peak pack spent most of its time in the core of its long-established territory [49], and all pack members from 2007 remained in the group. in summer 2007, three pack members were killed in intraspecific encounters, and the breeding male died in September, hit by a car. helminth eggs and protozoan cysts were identified through microscopic examination in 303 of the fecal samples. we hand-mixed fecal samples for 1 min through the plastic bag. we then placed 1.55 0.05 g of feces in a plastic container, mixed with 10 ml of sodium acetate\u2014acetic acid\u2014formaldehyde (SAF) fixative. we identified parasite eggs on the basis of their size, color, shape, look of content, and structure of the shell surface. eggs and cysts were identified to genus or species level [92\u2013102], except for the Taeniidae family whose eggs cannot be discriminated by microscopic examination. on FCM levels, we modeled FCM levels measured in samples from Yellowstone. we used population density, pack size, presence of free-ranging dogs, and month of sample collection as fixed-effects. the monitoring of packs in Yellowstone is much more intensive than in the european national parks. yELL-2007-SCI 5716, YELL-2008-SCI 5716, and YELL-2009-SCI 5716 were delivered by the authority of the national park. the wolf is protected in all three study areas (Abruzzo, Mercantour and Yellowstone) fecal cortisol metabolites levels were 7.0 2.3 ng/g (n = 18) in pups, 6.5 1.2 ng/g (n = 19) in yearlings, and 8.3 1.6 ng/g (n = 20) in adults. a reduced model with only an intercept term ranked as the most parsimonious model. all models were fitted with a random intercept for individual identity nested within pack identity, and a random intercept for winter of sample collection. mortality and month of collection affected FCM levels. in the socially and territorially stable Druid Peak pack, monthly differences in FCM levels were small compared to other sets of data. only candidate models with AICc 10 are shown. 12.0 1.9 8.3 15.8 territorial instability b 1.1 1.8 -2.4 4.6 mortality rate * 29.1 12.0 5.5 52.8 dispersal rate 3.7 6.9 -9.8 17.3 December c * -7.4 2.3 -11.9 -2.9 February c * -7.6 2.2 -11.9 -3.3 March c * -8.4 3.5 -15.4 -1.5 k: number of estimable parameters;
