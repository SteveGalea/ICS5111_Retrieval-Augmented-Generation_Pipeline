{"summary": "in 1918\u20131919, the outbreak of Spanish flu (H1N1) caused more than one billion infections and was considered the most lethal flu pandemic of the twentieth century. in modern world, respiratory infectious diseases can cause lots of deaths and economic losses. in modern world, respiratory infectious diseases can be spread by direct and indirect contacts or airborne transmission. literature showed droplet size distribution of cough [25\u201332], sneeze [26,27,33,34], speech [14,32,35] and breath [25,29,32,36\u201341] as well as concentration and number of the droplets. previous literature on droplet size distribution of respiratory activities. optical technology (optical particle counter) five healthy subjects cough 85% of the particles had diameters of less than 1 m Fennelly et al. [30] cough aerosol sampling system and solid impaction 16 patients infected with tuberculosis cough most particles were in the respirable size range. sneeze is a common exhalation mode in respiratory tract diseases. the biological dynamic mechanism of sneeze is significantly different from that of other respiratory activities. the total number of droplets generated during sneeze is larger than that of breath and cough. 62 kg (15 kg) and 4061 ml (1087 ml), respectively. no gender (M/F) age (years) height (m) weight (kg) FVC (ml) number of sneezes 1 M 24 1.72 70 4500 2 2 M 21 1.81 73 6500 1 3 M 25 1.82 75 5000 1 4 M 25 1.85 104 5000 5 5 M 21 1.8 65 4000 2 6 M 21 1.85 75 5100 1 7 F using a lens with focal length of 0.3 m, the size range that the system could measure was from 0.1 to 1000 m including 60 channels. the instrumental error was less than 1%. the sample frequency was set as 2.5 kHz, which means the size distribution of the spray was measured and recorded every 0.4 ms. all measurements were carried out in an indoor test room during the daytime. the room temperature was 23\u201324\u00b0C and the relative humidity (RH) was 32\u201333%. fresh air was supplied by the ventilation system located on the ceiling. cotton swabs used in this work were normal cotton swabs. soft hair and wools were long (about 5 cm in length) but tiny with a small diameter. the subjects were allowed to take a brief rest, drink water, gargle and wash face whenever they needed. twenty healthy subjects including 10 males and 10 females were recruited to participate in the experiment. all the subjects had no history or evidence of significant pulmonary diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe asthma) a laser particle size analyser, the \u2018Spraytec system\u2019 (Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK) was used to measure the size distribution of sneeze droplets. this system has been widely used in the measurements of aerosol size distribution [52\u201355] 2.1 where is the number size distribution of sneeze droplets. Ni is the total number of the droplets in size class i, i = 1, 2,..., n. N is the total volume of all the droplets. the size distribution of the background particles was excluded from the measured results of sneeze droplets by the spraytec system automatically. if the subjects did not sneeze successfully within 15 s after the measurement of the background particles, the SOP would be restarted and the background particles would be measured again. the duration of this break was long enough for the removal of the dispersed particles of the original sneeze. the repeated measurement was repeated following the same protocol. the subjects were well prepared before each sneeze and the sneeze behaviours were almost the same. three subjects have both unimodal and bimodal distributions in their sneezes. subject 4 has four unimodal distributions, subject 14 has one unimodal distribution and one bimodal distribution. subject 20 has one unimodal distribution and four bimodal distributions. eze lasts 0.3\u20130.7 s, so t = 100 ms is in the duration of the sneeze. it can be assumed that the droplets that are exhaled at t = 0\u2013100 ms will not re-enter the measurement zone before t = 100 ms. the two peaks of the bimodal volume-based size distribution are divided as two single peaks and fitted, respectively. the average values (standard deviations) of the means and variances of peak 1 are 2.7331 (0.0236) and 0.1524 (0.0231) and those of peak 2 are 1.9834 (0.0807) and 0.1644 (0.0447) respectively. 1045 6.7022 9A 2.7680 0.0882 6.2960 9B 2.7914 0.0925 6.3650 9C 2.7428 0.1330 6.8488 10A 2.7779 0.1177 6.6457 10B 2.7801 0.1116 6.8133 12A 2.6323

sneezes. as 14 subjects contributed more than one sneeze, the number size distributions of the multiple sneezes are averaged before combining with those of the others. the size class that has the most droplets is 341.5\u2013398.1 m for unimodal distribution and 73.6\u201385.8 m for bimodal distribution. the geometric mean of droplet size of all the sneezes is 360.1 m for unimodal distribution and 74.4 m for bimodal distribution with geometric standard deviations of 1.5 and 1.7. al. and Xie et al. are chosen in which the detailed size distributions were reported [14,26,28,35,51] for the works using the solid impaction method, almost all the expiration droplets were measured and counted. the total numbers of the droplets measured and counted in different measurements were significantly different. the geometric mean of each size class is used to represent the results. the effects of evaporation After the droplets are exhaled into the indoor environment, the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets. in the indoor environment, the RH and temperature are much lower than those in the respiratory tract. the difference of measurement method Different measurement methods also influence the results. for the measurements of Duguid, Loudon & Roberts and Xie et al., the solid impaction method was used. in their studies, the collection device changed the shape of the droplets. the maximum velocity of the exhaled airflow of sneeze is around 30\u2013100 m s1, significantly larger than that of cough, breath and speech [19,27,48]. turbulence can be induced in the respiratory tract by this high-speed airflow and corresponding turbulence produced by sneeze may also lead to larger droplets. twenty-one sneezes have unimodal volume-based size distributions. 23 sneezes have bimodal size distributions, and ratio is 1 : 1.1. of the subjects, 12 have unimodal volume-based size distributions. the maximum velocity of exhaled airflow can be found at t = 57\u2013110 ms for different persons. sneeze lasts 0.3\u20130.7 s, so t = 100 ms is in the duration of the sneeze. from figures 2 and 3, it can be seen that the single peak of the unimodal distribution and the two peaks of the bimodal distribution obviously meet the distribution characteristics of lognormal distribution. the fitting results of two sample sneezes are shown in figure 4. the lognormal distribution fitting curve is capable of accurately representing the volume-based size distributions of sneeze droplets. the two peaks of the bimodal volume-based size distribution are divided as two single peaks and fitted. no. mean U variance U coefficient AU 1A 2.7552 0.1730 7.0469 1B 2.7480 0.1452 6.8704 2A 2.8046 0.1500 7.0463 3A 2.6822 0.2103 7.0442 4A 2.6252 0.1681 6.7221 4B

one sneeze, the number size distributions of the multiple sneezes from one subject are averaged before combining with those of the others. the size class that has the most droplets is 341.5\u2013398.1 m for unimodal distribution and 73.6\u201385.8 m for bimodal distribution. the geometric mean of droplet size of all the sneezes is 360.1 m for unimodal distribution and 74.4 m for bi the results given by Duguid are the most closely related to the current study. the results of this work are also compared with those of cough and speech. the results are the most closely related to the current study. figure 5 shows a good similarity between the profiles of the bimodal distribution of this work and the results given by Loudon & Roberts and Xie et al.. but more droplets are found in the size range of 5\u201320 m according to the results of Chao et al. and Duguid. measurements were carried out immediately at mouth when the droplets were exhaled. the distance between the mouths of the subjects and the laser beam was quite small. the difference of measurement method Different measurement methods also influence the results. atomization mechanism is the main reason for droplet formation in respiratory activities. air-jet atomization is the interaction of a high-velocity airstream with that of a relatively slow moving flow of liquid. the size of the droplets formed in atomization processes is highly dependent upon the aerodynamic characteristics. the effects of evaporation After the droplets are exhaled into the indoor environment, the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets. the final equilibrium diameter of expiratory droplets after evaporation is highly dependent upon the temperature and RH of the environment. evaporation of droplets had limited effects on the measurement results of this work. the difference of measurement method differs from that of duguid, Loudon & Roberts and Xie et al. the maximum velocity of the exhaled airflow of sneeze is around 30\u2013100 m s1 significantly larger than that of cough, breath and speech [19,27,48]. turbulence can be induced in the respiratory tract by this high-speed airflow and corresponding turbulence produced by sneeze may also lead to a large number of droplets [32], i.e. the number of the droplets generated by sneeze is about 18 times larger the p-value and adjusted R2-value can be obtained to test the significance level and goodness of the fitting results. as many subjects contributed more than one sneeze, the average values of the means and variances of the multiple sneezes were used in the linear regression analysis. the ratio of the average of the coefficients of the two peaks of the bimodal distribution is 3 according to table 4. the coefficients and of the two peaks of the bimodal distribution should be first evaluated according to equation (4.3), respectively (as and), and then re-scaled based on the ratio of 3. the volume-based size distribution of sneeze droplets of an adult can be calculated by using equations (3.1) and (3.2) a significant uncertainty in the calculation results of the number size distribution of small droplets. the volume frequency of the small droplets can be estimated according to the volume-based size distribution by using equations (3.1)\u2013(4.4) then the number proportion of the small droplets can be calculated. droplets from infected individuals may be larger than those from healthy subjects. higher mucus content may lead to larger final equilibrium diameter of droplets after evaporation. studies on contents of expiratory droplets exhaled by infected individual are also strongly needed to understand transmission characteristics of respiratory infectious disease. the distribution parameters of the unimodal distributions have no significant correlation with the physiological characteristics of the subjects. the p-values for the means and variances with the heights, weights and FVCs are all larger than 0.24 and the adjusted R2-values are all quite small. the volume-based size distribution of sneeze droplets of an adult can be calculated by using equations (3.1) and (3.2) the distribution parameter needed in equations (3.1) and (3.2) can be approximately estimated by using equations (4.1)\u2013(4.4) or by using the average values of the distribution parameters. then the number size distribution can be calculated according to equation (2.1). the distance between the mouth of the subjects and the measurement zone is measured and kept around 0.05 m during each sneeze. the changes of distance between the mouths of the subjects and the laser beam may also increase the uncertainty. the mucus content in the droplets exhaled by ill subjects will be different from that exhaled by healthy subjects. the final equilibrium diameter of droplets after complete evaporation is 16% of the initial droplet diameter under the RH of 0%. the size of sneeze droplets of the unimodal distribution is significantly larger than that of cough and speech. similarity can be found between the bimodal distribution and that of other respiratory activities. studies on droplet production process and atomization mechanisms of the respiratory activities are still strongly needed."}
