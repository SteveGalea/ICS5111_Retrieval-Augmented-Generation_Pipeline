{"summary": "the study performed an extensive search for unknown viruses in 55 german vespertilionid bats based on both generic PCR assays and virus isolation techniques. a broader study investigating changes in german bats in association with infectious pathogens. the family Adenoviridae was verified by the first reaction of a generic adenovirus-specific nested PCR (10) the obtained sequence of a fragment of the DNA polymerase gene indicated that the viruses were a novel virus type within the genus Mastadenovirus and was tentatively named bat adenovirus 2 (bat AdV-2) strain P. pipistrellus virus 1 (PPV1). the partial sequence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase (3,408 bp; GenBank accession no. FJ983127) was obtained after longRange PCR. the identities of bat AdV-2 PPV1 to closely related adenoviruses ranged from 68% to 74% on nucleic acid level. phylogenetic tree constructed by using multiple alignment of 550-bp amplicons. alignment was analyzed with neighbor-joining method and p-distance model in MEGA4. branch length is proportional to evolutionary distance (scale bar) infected Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats, adenovirus was not detected by PCR assays. adenovirus was detected in high DNA copy numbers in the intestine. adenovirus was not detected by homogenized frozen tissue samples. in all 3 infected bats, the highest copy number of adenovirus DNA was detected in the intestine, which suggests a correlation with a gastrointestinal disease. the host range of mastadenoviruses is known to be limited to a single (or a few closely related) mammalian species (13) with a probable co-evolution between virus and their hosts (14). a new chiropteran virus is isolated from free-ranging vespertilionid bats. the virus represents the only chiropteran virus isolate besides lyssavirus (rabies) found in Europe."}
