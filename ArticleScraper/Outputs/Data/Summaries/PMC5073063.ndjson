K3326, polycarbonate translucent amber, and no. K3325, polycarbonate translucent red; BioServe Flemington, NJ), clear (polycarbonate translucent clear, model no. R20, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), or opaque (PVC ASTM F891-10, Charlotte Pipe, Charlotte, NC) tunnel (length, 6 in.; inner diameter, 3 in.; wall thickness, 1/8 in. a total of 720 min (12-h light phase) was recorded for each observation phase. a total of 720 min (12-h light phase) was recorded for each observation phase. blood was collected from rats through cardiocentesis. a 70% CO2\u201330% air mixture was passed into an acrylic gas anesthesia chamber. each rat was removed and allowed to breathe room air while blood was collected by using a 3-mL luer-lock syringe. mortality and morbidity have been less than 5%. melatonin was extracted from 0.05-mL samples in duplicate. a 0.25 mm capillary column with helium as the carrier gas was used for separations. ELISA of corticosterone was used to measure corticosterone levels. corticosterone sensitivity was 4.5 ng/mL, the lower limit of detection was 15 ng/mL and the coefficient of variation was less than 4.0%. Statistical analysis. all data are compared by using one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test and 2-tailed paired or unpaired t test by using Prism software. rats at this age were provided with only group social enrichment during rearing. animal use and accompanying procedures were in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. rats were maintained in ventilated cages using hardwood maple bedding. rats were housed in translucent ventilated laboratory rat cages (2 rats per cage; 10.5 in. 19.0 in. 8.0 in.; wall thickness, 0.1 in.) after this time, subjects were assigned at random to 1 of 4 treatment groups that contained either an amber, red (no. K3326, polycarbonate translucent amber, and no. K3325) animal room lighting intensity was measured at 1 m above the floor in the right, left, and center of the individually ventilated cage rack. animal room lighting intensity was measured at 1 m above the floor in the right, left, and center of the individually ventilated cage rack. on day 8, animals were housed with their respective CED. on day 11, alternate times were recorded (0600 to 800, 1000 to 1200, 1400 to 1600) for phase 1 sampling, rats had their respective CED inside the cage for 3 and 4 d (experimental days 10 and 11, respectively) a total of 720 min (12-h light phase) was recorded for each observation phase. plasma samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C until assayed for melatonin, TFA, and corticosterone. dark-phase sampling was performed in less than 1 min (from removal until recovery) in the home cage under 1 or 2 low-intensity safelight red lamps. exposure at rodent eye level was 45.0 to 179.5 W/cm2. a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector, auto injector and integrator was used to analyze methyl esters of fatty acids according to their retention time. a 0.25 mm 30 cm capillary column with helium as the carrier gas was used for separations. the minimum detection level for the assay was 0.05 g/mL. Statistical significance among the group means was set at a P value of less than 0.05. Mean daytime animal room illumination at the left, right, and center of the rack 1 m above the floor with the detector facing the ceiling had relatively small variance. measured 265.0 43.2 lx (n = 21 [7 wk, 3 positions]) rats spent significantly more time in the red (mean SEM, 290 74 min, P = 0.0059), amber (110 28 min, P = 0.008), and opaque (68 20 min, P = 0.0248) compared with the clear CED tunnel (8 5 min) rats used all tunnels significantly less during the blood-sampling phase (phase 2, days 24 and 25; red: 38 22 min, P = 0.0312; amber: 10 9 min, P = 0.0305; opaque dietary intake differed between the opaque and clear CED groups. dietary intake differed between the opaque and clear CED groups. body weight change differed significantly between amber and red. plasma melatonin concentrations were low for all treatment groups at 0800, 1200, and 1600 (23.2 6.8 pg/mL) at 2000, melatonin levels in amber (26.9 1.8 pg/mL; P = 0.012) and opaque (23.5 1.6 pg/mL; P = 0.035) peak levels of melatonin occurred at 2400 for all rats. at 0400, the amber CED group melatonin level (252.0 42.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that for the clear CED group (247.0 68.0 pg/mL) at 0400, the amber CED group melatonin level (252.0 42.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that for the clear CED group (78.2 57.1 pg/mL) melatonin level (252.0 42.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than the clear CED group (78.2 57.1 pg/mL, P = 0.0163) all plasma TFA values in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with free access to food displayed a significant rhythm in all CED treatment groups. all CED groups nadir at 0800 and rise continuously until their peak at 2000. at 2400 and 0400 time points, the red CED group's values were significantly lower (P = 0.0121) when compared with those for the clear CED control group. measurements of radiometric irradiance (lx) from inside the CED positioned in the middle of each cage were made daily (amber, 2.4 0.7 lx [n = 15, P = 0.0046]; red, 1.3 0.5 lx [n = 12, P 0.0001]; opaque, 1.8 0.5 lx [n = 7, P 0.0001); and clear, 3.9 1.8 lx [n = 14]. instantaneous scan sampling for the time (mean SEM) that rats spent inside either the amber, clear, red, or opaque colored enrichment device (CED) before (phase I) and during (phase II) the experiment. rats spent significantly more time in the red (290 74 min, P = 0.0059), amber (110 28 min, P = 0.008), and opaque (68 20 min, P = 0.0248) than in the clear (8 5 min) CED. body weight change differed significantly between amber (P = 0.0023) and red (P = 0.0022) CED groups compared with the clear control CED group (clear, 269.3 40.8 g; amber, 260.5 40.0 g; red, 260.5 40.0 g; red, 280.2 42.6 g; opaque, 274.5 44.0 g; n = 36 [6 measurements, 6 rats per group]) plasma melatonin concentrations were low for all treatment groups at 0800, 1200, and 1600 (23.2 6.8 pg/mL) melatonin concentrations were low for all treatment groups at 0800, 1200, and 1600 (23.2 6.8 pg/mL), as expected for rats during the light phase. melatonin concentrations were low for all treatment groups at 0800, 1200, and 1600 (23.2 6.8 pg/mL) during the light phase as expected. the hormone levels were significantly higher (P = 0.0348) at the 0800 time point in the red CED group. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with free access to food displayed a significant rhythm in all CED treatment groups. all CED treatment groups displayed a nadir at 1600 (1041 43 g/mL) and a peak at 0400 (5598 161 g/mL) all CED groups nadir at 0800, and rise continuously until their peak at 2000. at 2400 and 0400 time points, the red CED group's values were significantly lower (P = 0.0121) when compared with those for the clear CED. we chose to evaluate the commonly used tinted rat enrichment tunnels in this study. we used 4 types of CED: the 2 colors (amber and red) commonly available from manufacturers of rat enrichment tubes. opaque tubes included because CED produced inhouse are often constructed of PVC. the current study used social housing of rat pairs with EE. this resulted in the red CED group consuming more food and water with a corresponding increase in body weight. more studies should be conducted to reveal mechanisms underlying this finding. reviews show the great diversity in control housing conditions, the amount of space provided in cages, social group number, rat strain and sex, age at onset of EE, age at onset of EE, types of physical objects used for EE, and behavioral tests used. social enrichment has a greater effect when compared with EE or isolation or impoverished conditions. melatonin concentrations were low for all CED groups during the light phase. the hormone levels were statistically (but perhaps not clinically) significantly higher at the 0800 time point in the red CED group. at 2000, melatonin concentrations of the amber and opaque CED groups rose more rapidly than that of the clear CED group. nadir occurs after the onset of light, with gradual increases throughout the light phase. all nighttime values of corticosterone were less than 51 ng/mL. an animal's enclosure should withstand cleaning procedures and not interfere with the animals\u2019 health or research use. experimental design changes would give us a better indication of the effects of a novel object (shortly after object introduced) compared with acclimation to the object (here, after 2 wk) an animal responds to changes in novelty by displaying fear-associated defensive reactions, such as freezing and escape, or by mounting exploratory associated reactions. studies are evaluating the effects of other commonly used CED. the popular plastic hut for mice is made in amber, red, and blue plastics. the effects of colored EE tunnels we used can not be completely controlled."}
