{"summary": "febrile illness is correlated with alterations in the body\u2019s thermoregulation, infection, illness, disease, exercise, athlete, sport, performance, return to play, metabolism, hydration, and dehydration. no strong clinical research has been published on return to play during or following acute febrile illness. the relationship between exercise and susceptibility to infection is often compared with a J-shaped curve. moderate exercise enhances immunity above sedentary levels but prolonged, intense activity impairs immune function. the immune response to exercise depends on many factors, including duration, intensity, type of exercise, hormone and cytokine concentrations. moderate exercise is defined as exercise at 40% to 60% of maximum heart rate for 5 to 60 minutes. IL-6 directly stimulates type 2 T-cell cytokine production, which itself suppresses the immune system\u2019s ability to induce tissue damage and inflammation. hyperthermia is defined as an elevation of body temperature secondary to heat production. normal body processes that cool the body during times of heat stress are not active during times of fever. this adaptive response is initiated by pyrogens that can be either endogenous or exogenous. increased peripheral vascular resistance shunts blood away from the peripheral capillary beds, leading to decreased heat loss through conduction, radiation, convection, and evaporative means. mammals attempt to regulate body temperature by means of evaporative cooling. if they are also severely dehydrated, their body decreases or inhibits these means of cooling. blood lactate levels are increased by as much as 17% during exercise after infection. blood lactate levels are increased by as much as 17% during exercise after infection and could take up to 50 weeks before returning to normal levels. a similar study showed a 13% to 18% reduction in endurance capacity in those suffering from acute infectious disease requiring bed rest. no reduction of endurance capacity was observed in healthy controls undergoing only bed rest for the same period. thermoregulation, Metabolism, and Fluid Homeostasis Fever has many ill effects on the body. pyrogens reset the hypothalamic set point, resulting in an elevation of body temperature secondary to heat production. pyrogens can be either endogenous or exogenous. increased adrenaline production increases metabolic rate, heart rate, and muscle tone. there is approximately a 10% increase in metabolic rate for every 1\u00b0C increase in body temperature. fever, their bodies\u2019 natural temperature-regulating mechanisms are altered. fever is correlated with a reduction in exercise tolerance, decreased endurance and muscle strength, and an increase in perceived fatigue. decreases in strength can be attributed to generalized muscle catabolism induced during infection and fever. preconditioned group.27 patients performed a mild physical activity program consisting of getting out of bed every half hour during waking hours during a febrile course. they did not experience the orthostatic declines or blood volume reductions normally induced by illness and bed rest. studies also looked at the effects of infection on muscle strength and endurance compared with the effects of bed rest. stroke volume increases 23% to 27% after resolution of fever compared with baseline. increased heart rate helped to maintain cardiac output at normal values. decreases in speed and coordination are observed during and shortly after periods of brief febrile illness. contaminated water sources may cause acute febrile illness, especially when these events last longer than just 1 day. examples include outbreaks of leptospirosis that occurred during the 2000 Eco-Challenge multisport race held in Malaysia. outbreaks have also been associated with public swimming pools. knowledge of incubation periods of specific respiratory viruses and periods of infectivity can be useful in helping to prevent the spread of illness. study shows strenuous exercise during an ongoing acute infection can counteract potential benefits to cardiac muscle. a review of multiple large international sporting events did not show an increased incidence of illness. a systematic review of the effectiveness of physical interventions at reducing the spread of respiratory viruses found that frequent handwashing was effective 55% of the time in interrupting virus spread. it is imperative to know what diseases are prevalent in different regions of the world during the different seasons and which ones can and should be immunized against or given prophylaxis. improving personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene, can help reduce spread by direct contact. recommendations range from resumption of training as soon as fever has resolved to waiting 7 to 14 days after symptoms to resume physical activity. athletes should be held from all physical activity until 3 weeks from the onset of symptoms. if present, splenomegaly has resolved. strenuous exercise has a short-term negative effect on the immune system, increasing the risk of acute infection. regular mild-moderate exercise can be protective against infection. fever can have detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system."}
