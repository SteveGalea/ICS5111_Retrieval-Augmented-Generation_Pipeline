{"summary": "lack of proofreading mechanisms and high replication rates among most RNA viruses make them inherently error-prone. there is also variation in mutation rates among both species and strains of RNA viruses, making them inherently error-prone. fidelity itself a trait with a genetic basis subject to some fine-tuning by selection. high-fidelity variants of PV, CV, foot and mouth disease virus and CHIKV have also been shown to be attenuated in various hosts [10,20\u201325], suggesting that there is likely a delicate balance between the need for accuracy and diversity among RNA viruses. there is clearly a need to characterize these relationships for other medically important arboviruses. increased diversity has also been associated with decreased WNV virulence in mice [31], suggesting that altering the capacity to accumulate mutations could have host-specific phenotypic consequences. we used experimental evolution in the presence of the antiviral ribavirin to identify mutations in the WNV replication complex important in regulating fidelity. media was removed and monolayers in 6-well cell culture plates were overlaid with 1ml media containing the antiviral compound. media was replaced with 100ul of virus diluted in media supplemented with antiviral compound and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. supernatants were harvested at day 5 pi and titrated by plaque assay on vero kidney cells. WNV amplicons of nucleotides 1311\u20133248 (envelope/ns1 genes; [29]) were created for deep-sequencing using the same methodology with WNV RNA isolated following 72 h growth on Aedes albopictus cells. a minimum of two-fold redundancy throughout each clone or consensus fragment was required for sequence data to be considered complete. 10057A (V793I), and G10096A (G806R) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the WNV-IC using mutagenic primer sets along with the QuikChange XLII SDM kit (Stratagene) as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. mutant and control WNV-IC plasmids were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4h. RNA was purified with the MEGAclear kit (Ambion) in fusion proteins containing a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tag were co-expressed from a second plasmid, pUBPS. the final construct (pET26Ub-WNV NS5-CHIS) was confirmed by sequencing at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Nucleic Acid Facility. pET26Ub-WNV-NS5-CHIS cells were grown in 100 mL of media (NZCYM) supplemented with kanamycin (25 g/mL), chloramphenicol (20 g/mL) and spectinomycin (S50) at 37\u00b0C until an OD600 of 1.0 was reached. the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, cooled to 15\u00b0C and then phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and NP-40 were added to a final concentration of 1 mM and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. the lysate was stirred for an additional 30 min at 4\u00b0C after the last addition of PEI. while stirring, pulverized ammonium sulfate was slowly added to 60% (w/v) saturation. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol; MWCO of 24,000 Da) the dialyzed protein was then passed through a hi-Load 16/600 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) min in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. reactions were quenched at various times by the addition of 50 mM EDTA. cxT cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate and maintained at 28\u00b0C in 5% CO2. after one hour absorption period at 37\u00b0C (BHK) or 28\u00b0C (CxT), cells were gently washed, overlaid with 2 ml of maintenance media and incubated at appropriate temperatures. titrations were performed in duplicate, by plaque assay on Vero cells. mean titers for each time point were calculated. WNV RNA genomes were also quantified following extraction with QIAamp viral RNA spin columns (Qiagen) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 50 g/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 g/ml Fungizone. samples were thawed and homogenized for 30 seconds at 24hz. debris was then pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rcf for 5 minutes. media was removed and monolayers in 6-well cell culture plates were overlaid with 1ml media containing the antiviral compound. media was replaced with 100ul of virus diluted in media supplemented with antiviral compound and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. supernatants were harvested at day 5 pi and titrated by plaque assay.

Fractions with the highest purity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol; MWCO of 24,000 Da) the dialyzed protein was then passed through a hi-Load 16/600 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) the NS5 elongation competent complex was mixed with 25 M heparin, 50 mM NaCl and 100 M NTP substrate (either ATP or GTP) at 30\u00b0C. reactions were quenched at various times by the addition of 50 mM EDTA. baby hamster kidney cells (BHK; ATCC) and Culex tarsalis mosquito cells (CxT) were infected with virus, in triplicate, using 6-well plates, at a MOI of 0.01 pfu/cell (multi-step), 10.0 pfu/cell (BHK one-step), or 8.0 pfu/cell (CxT one-step) hpi for one-step kinetics, diluted 1:10 in media containing 20% FBS, and stored at -80\u00b0C. WNV RNA genomes were also quantified following extraction with QIAamp viral RNA spin columns (Qiagen) using a TaqMan quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay. s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 50 g/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 g/ml Fungizone. samples were thawed and homogenized for 30 seconds at 24hz in a Mixer Mill MM301 (Retsch) clonal populations were created with lineage I from 20 plaques isolations (pp) and strains with the highest levels of resistance (WNV pp3/9) were chosen for further characterization. a total of 15 (pp3) and 18 (pp9) nt substitutions were identified, resulting in 9 and 8 aa substitutions. is expected to interact with the RdRp domain. both T248 and G806 are conserved among lineage I WNV strains. no naturally circulating strains were found to possess the identified mutations at these locations.

Location of the mutation sites associated with altered fidelity in WNV NS5. the MTase and polymerase domains shown in (A) are rendered as pink and red surfaces. substitution of residue by an isoleucine could impact the interface between the two domains of NS5 structure. mutants created included WNV T248I, V793I, G806R, double mutant V793I/G806R, and triple mutant (T248I/G806R) mutations identified in WNV populations with the highest ribavirin resistance were reverse engineered into the WNV-IC individually (T248I, V793I and G806R) and in combination (V793I/G806R, T248I/V793I/G806R, and T248I/V793I/G806R) and assessed for mutagen resistance. mutations were distributed throughout the sequenced regions for all WNV strains. transition to transversion ratios were 2:1 for WNV-IC and WNV T248I, yet 1 for WNV V793I/G806R. increased mutation resulted primarily from A misincorporations. a. Mean distribution of genomic diversity (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNP]) of 2 replicates of WNV-IC across the sequenced region. the distribution of mutations was similar among strains. fidelity differences implied by deep-sequencing data were redesigned to quantify A:C mispairs, equivalent to G to A substitutions. the number and proportion of G to A substitutions identified following growth in mosquito cells differed. the presence of both ATP and GTP together promote full extension to 20-mer RNA as the terminal templating bases are competent for correct nucleotide addition. there is no observable difference in the kinetics of GMP misincorporation. kinetics were similar among mutants with the exception of WNV V793I. WNV RNA was quantified with qRT-PCR following one-step growth and particle/pfu ratios were quantified. WNV RNA (viral particles) and infectious virus (pfu) were quantified following 1-step growth on mosquito (CxT) or vertebrate (BHK) cell culture. specific infectivity (particle/pfu) was compared among WNV-IC, WNV V793I/G806R and WNV T248I. infectivity was slightly higher for WNV-IC relative to colonized mosquitoes. a general lack of infectivity was confirmed for replication complex mutants. antiviral ribavirin was used to select for WNV variants with decreased susceptibility and putative alterations to polymerase fidelity. ribavirin susceptibility was measured by reduction in viral titer following treatment. lineage I viral titer decreased just 1.4-fold following treatment. full-genome sequencing of clonal strains WNV pp3 and WNV pp9 was completed. a total of 15 (pp3) and 18 (pp9) nt substitutions were identified. shared aa substitutions in the WNV RdRp and methyltransferase genes exclusively were chosen for further characterization. nucleotide (NT) and amino acid (AA) mutations identified in biological clones with decreased ribavirin susceptibility. shared AA substitutions identified in the WNV replication complex, including RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) changes.

Approximately the same number of U to A mutations were identified for WNV V793I/G806R as WNV T248I (4 vs 3) complexes were assembled using a 5\u2019-phosphorylated trinucleotide primer (pGGC), single stranded RNA template, UTP and CTP. labeling of the elongation complex was achieved by using -32P-labeled nucleotide. elongation complex was stable and capable of rapid incorporation of the next correct nucleotide substrate (elongation) to produce a 16-mer RNA product. means of 6, 0 and 20 identified in WNV-IC, WNV V793I/G806R and WNV T248I respectively. results demonstrate sequence-specific fidelity differences among WNV mutant strains. kinetics of GMP misincorporation (G:U mispair) shown is the percentage of RNA product plotted as a function of time and fit to a single exponential. difference in the efficiency of AMP misincorporation is observed between the three NS5 proteins. trends measured with infectivity consistent with fidelity differences in both cell lines. highest infectivity measured with the RdRp double mutant WNV V793I/G806R and lowest infectivity measured with the Mtase mutant WNV T248I. differences only significant relative to WNV-IC for WNV T248I in BHK cells. significantly decreased infectivity was measured for WNV T248I relative to WNV-IC and WNV V793I/G806R. infectivity of WNV-IC was compared to infectivity of WNV T248I and WNV V793I/G806R in colonized Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes following exposure to infectious bloodmeals. population WNV strain BM titer (log10/ml) Day 4 or 5 (%) Day 7 (%) Day 10 (%) Day 12 or 14 (%) TOTAL (%) colony WNV-IC 7.8 30/110 (27.3) 30/100 (30) 31/69 (44.9) 37/79 (46.8) 128/358 (35.8) the relative decrease in mutation frequency measured for the WNV high fidelity variant V793I/G806R (2.5 fold) is similar or modestly higher than has been shown with other systems [21,22,24,25,44] the lack of biochemical capacity or extent of phenotypic consequences by-in-large prevent highly significant alterations to RdRp fidelity. a 4-mer ssRNA substrate can be accommodated in the WNV NS5 RdRp active site with minimal steric clashes with the protein atoms. the active-site residue Trp-800 would alter its sidechain conformation to be able to stack against the priming nucleotide. the priming loop maintains numerous interactions with residues from the thumb, fingers and palm subdomains. the loop harboring T248 is predicted to interact with the region of the fingers in the polymerase domain (aa 350\u2013365) it is very likely that amino acid substitution of T248 by an isoleucine could affect the interactions between the two domains and the inter-domain dynamics. this eventually affecting the polymerase active site and altering fidelity. strain-dependent mutational biases could result in unique evolutionary trajectories and strain-specific differences in mutational robustness and susceptibility to lethal mutagenesis. if mutational landscapes are strain-specific, so too are fitness landscapes of viral swarms and therefore evolutionary pressures acting on them. mutator phenotypes are not necessarily inextricably bound phenotypes. a virus with a mutator phenotype would not also be attenuated in vertebrate cell culture. in vivo models that more accurately represent natural infections could reveal important phenotype differences in vertebrate systems. study with vesicular stomatitis virus demonstrates slower mutation rates in insect cells as compared to mammalian cells. biophysical and biochemical properties of replication complex might differ significantly in environments with variable temperature, pH, and nucleotide availability."}
