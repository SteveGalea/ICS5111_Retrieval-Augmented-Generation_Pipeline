{"summary": "most cases of gastroenteritis are viral infections, and norovirus (NoV) is the most common causative agent of the disease accounting for >90% of nonbacterial cases of gastroenteritis (1). other factors also contribute to the spread of NoV throughout the population. studies on other enteric viruses, such as hepatitis A virus and poliovirus, showed some discrepancies about RH parameters (15\u201318) caliciviruses, such as feline calicivirus (FCV), and more recently Tulane virus and murine norovirus (MNV) have been used as surrogates to study human noV. retrospective analyses of epidemiological data suggest that cold, dry weather along with herd immunity might explain the high number of NoV gastroenteritis cases during winter. previous studies showed that human noV infections could occur via fomites or aerosols (i.e., vomitus), as reviewed previously (28), and the presence of the noV genome could be detected for up to 7 days in stool samples stored at room temperature (22). VLPs from the GII.4 Cairo4 strain were used for binding assay. they have the capacity to bind saliva from secretor and nonsecretor individuals. the protein content for the VLP preparation was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce, Brebieres, France) LP and MNV preparations were first dried for 1 h at 10% RH, unless otherwise stated, at room temperature and were kept at 10% RH. after exposure to different RHs, the glass coupons were immersed in 3 ml of TGEB buffer that was agitated at 25\u00b0C for 15 min to fully recover the viral particles. for each time point, 100 l of the viral suspension was used for MNV titration. VLPs that had been dried for 1 h at 10% RH prior to resuspension were used as the positive control (10% RH-1 h) each sample was used for the SDS-PAGE analysis, EM observation, and saliva binding assay. resuspended VLPs were resolved in a 10 to 20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel in denaturing conditions with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer. VP1 protein was detected using an in-house GII.4-specific MAb that recognizes the linear epitope. alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using NBT-BCIP for 10 min at room temperature. the minimum and maximum daily temperatures and RH levels for a 14-year period spanning 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2013 (n = 5,113 days) were plotted on a separate graph for each season (winter from 21 December through 20 March, spring from 21 March through 20 June, summer from 21 June through 20 September, and autumn from 21 September through 20 December in accordance with M\u00e9t\u00e9o France guidelines) the extreme (i.e., minimum and maximum) daily AH levels were plotted against the corresponding temperature for the protein content for the VLP preparation was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce, Brebieres, France) salts used for the experiments were lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium nitrate, and potassium chloride, for equilibration at 10, 35, 55, and 85% RH. glass coupons with MNV were immersed in 3 ml of TGEB buffer. agitated at 25\u00b0C for 15 min to fully recover the viral particles. the viral suspension was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed at 80\u00b0C until further use. for each time point, 100 l of the viral suspension was used for MNV titration. Dried material was resuspended in 30 l of TNC buffer. protein content was determined for each assay using a BCA protein assay. each sample was used for the SDS-PAGE analysis, EM observation. VP1 protein was detected using an in-house GII.4-specific MAb. bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. negatively stained VLPs were observed on a hitachi 7500 transmission electron microscope. AH = 0.622 p \u2032 RH 10,132,500 p \u2032 RH AH is expressed in kilograms of water per kilogram of dry air (kg water/kg air) p\u2032 is the saturation vapor pressure in pascals at temperature (\u00b0C) for each experimental condition, N represents the mean titer of the MNV inoculum before the drying process. Error bars represent the standard deviation of at least three repeated experiments. the time for complete dehydration of the droplets was RH dependent: the lower the RH, the faster the drying process. the highest recovery of infectious material was obtained for 10% RH. for 55 and 85% RH, a sharp decrease was observed after 6 h of incubation. no infectious MNVs were detected after 12 h. the first experiments showed that low RHs were more suitable to MNV survival. the data showed that the MNV titer was always higher at 9\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C (P = 0.0069, Kruskal-Wallis) we performed real-time RT-PCR analysis on inoculum kept for 1 and 20 h. reduction in viral genome copies was highest for 55 and 85% RHs. decrease in genome copies was highest for 1.4-log10 reductions. an AH below 0.007 kg water/kg air is detrimental to noV persistence. however, at 100% RH and 25\u00b0C, corresponding to 0.02 kg water/kg air, infectious particles were still observed. the humidity of the air acted primarily on the capsid protein. saliva samples from O (A), A (B), B (C) and nonsecretor (D) individuals were characterized for the presence of the ABO and Lewis antigens. purified VLPs were diluted in PBS and stored at 80\u00b0C for 1 week before being used for the binding assay. we first performed an SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein content corresponding to each RH. a doublet corresponding to VP1 protein was observed as described previously. specific staining of the VP1 protein after blotting showed no degradation of the VP1 protein. VLPs were dried for 1 h at 10% RH before being placed at various RH levels. unscathed VLPs were observed for 10% RH. a few scathed VLPs in the presence of a large amount of aggregated materials were observed for RHs. the daily AH and temperature for the last 14 years recorded at Montsouris Park (Paris, France) are plotted for each season. the vertical line indicates the limit of 0.007 kg water/kg air. the percentage of data lower than this value is indicated for each season. a large volume of inoculum (i.e., 100 to 500 l) markedly extended the time required for complete dehydration of the sample. this prolonged drying period led to complete inactivation of the MNV at 25\u00b0C. in the next experiment, glass coupons with MNV suspensions were directly placed in various RH environments for 1 h. preliminary drying kinetic experiment was performed by weight loss measurements. showed that complete drying was achieved in less than 1 h. 20 l of inoculum was completely evaporated within 30 min at 25\u00b0C and 10% RH with minor effects on the virus titer. a viral suspension was used as the control and was stored in the dark for the same period of time. the experiment was pursued for 3 months at 10% RH and 25\u00b0C. infectious MNV particles were still present after 3 months. the decrease in genome copies was the highest for 55 and 85% RHs with a 1.4-log10 reduction. the loss of infectious material while viral genomic RNA was still present suggested that viral inactivation was due to capsid alteration rather than genomic RNA degradation. the ratio between the number of MNV genome copies (N) and the N0 (the number of recovered genome copies after 1 h of drying at 10% RH) is indicated as a percentage (ordinate) at 9\u00b0C, AH never exceeded 0.007 kg water/kg air for up to 100% RH and infectious MNV was observed for all RH. binding capacity of VLPs at different RHs was first compared to those of control VLPs stored at 80\u00b0C (control). maintaining VLPs at an RH ranging between 10 and 85% reduced binding capacity of noV VLPs to that observed with VLPs in suspension. for 35 and 55% RH, VLP binding to saliva was totally abolished (0.0001 P 0.02) for secretor and nonsecretor individuals. there was no statistical difference in binding for VLPs that had been stored at 10% RH for 1 h and 1 week at 10% RH. VLPs were dried under 10% RH at 25\u00b0C for 1 h (lane 5) and 1 week (lane 6) for 35 to 100% RH, VP1 protein was labeled with in-house specific MAbs. the complete (VP1) and truncated (VP1*) capsid proteins for GII.4 VLPs have been described. unscathed VLPs were observed for 10% RH. a few scathed VLPs in the presence of a large amount of aggregated materials were observed for RHs at 35 and 55%. binding was still observed at 85% RH, even though only amorphous material was observed. only 20.3% of data were below the limit value of 0.007 kg water/kg air. 96.3% of data were below 0.007 kg water/kg air during the winter. DISCUSSION NoV gastroenteritis is often called gastric flu. we used cultivatable MNV as a surrogate and human NoV VLPs. the VLPs mimic the binding properties of native human noV particles. the evaporation process should be kept as short as possible with the lowest RH. despite the fact that viral RNA is absent from VLPs, our data demonstrated that the capsid structure was well preserved. despite the fact that viral RNA is absent from VLPs, our data demonstrated that the capsid structure was well preserved. binding to nonsecretor saliva was the most labile even at low RH. binding to nonsecretor saliva was the most labile even at low RH. the size of the population that could become infected will thus change. 10 to 100% RH at 9\u00b0C and 10 and 35% RH at 25\u00b0C correspond to AHs ranging from 0.0007 to 0.007 kg water/kg air. a completely water-saturated atmosphere (i.e., 100% RH) is comparable to a liquid suspension in which human NoV and MNV remain infectious for a long period of time. noroviruses: low winter AH provides favorable conditions for noV transmission and thus increases the prevalence by dynamic resonance. AH may better reflect the higher persistence of infectious particles at low temperatures and low humidity."}
