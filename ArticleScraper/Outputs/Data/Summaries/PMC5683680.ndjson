{"summary": "IL-4 rs2227283 and IL-4 rs2227288 have no correlation in with risk of virus-induced encephalitis. TT and GT + TT genotypes were related to IL-10 rs1800872. these were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis. il-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may have particular host susceptibility to virus-induced encephalitis. encephalitis is a life-threatening disorder characterized by inflammation of brain tissue. inflammation associated with brain parenchyma is linked to and a consequence of viral infections. interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) are 2 cytokines that have strong links to encephalitis [15\u201317] it has been suggested that IL-4 is crucial to the induction of the naive helper T (Th0) cells differentiating to type 2 helper T (Th2) cells [18,19]. IL-4 is known to have 2 different receptor complexes: the IL-4R chain and the c chain [20], 112 patients (63 males and 49 females) with a mean age of 39.8915.98 years participated in the study. all subjects had been previously diagnosed with virus-induced encephalitis. the control group consisted of 109 healthy individuals. IL-4 rs2243283/rs2243288 and IL-10 rs1800871/rsl800872 were eligible for further study. PCR primers were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon BioTech Co., Ltd. Xilin Biotechnology Co., Ltd. to determine the genotypes of IL-4 rs2243283, IL-4 rs2243288, IL-10 rs1800871, and IL-10 rsl800872. 15.98 years ranging from 14 to 78 years participated in the study. all subjects had been previously diagnosed with virus-induced encephalitis. the control group consisted of 109 healthy individuals. IL-4 rs2243283/rs2243288 and IL-10 rs1800871/rsl800872 were eligible for further study. PCR primers were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon BioTech Co., Ltd.

IL-10 rs1800872 polymorphism may be a risk factor for colorectal cancer development in european populations. previous studies have revealed that polymorphisms in IL-10-592C/A (rs1800872) were associated with risk factors of acute myeloid leukemia and enhanced the likelihood of early-onset preeclampsia [48,49] prospective studies should be performed to provide stronger evidence of the mechanisms of IL-4 and IL-10 rs1800872 gene polymorphisms in virus-induced encephalitis."}
