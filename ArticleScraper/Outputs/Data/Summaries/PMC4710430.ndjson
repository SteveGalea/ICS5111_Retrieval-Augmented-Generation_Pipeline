{"summary": "despite a relatively quiet period without major epidemics for the past two decades, dengue returned to prominence with its scale and speed of Chinese outbreaks in 2014. despite its scale and speed of Chinese outbreaks in 2014, including the Guangdong epidemic, infecting over 40,000 people within 2 months. sequences shorter than 1,000 nucleotides and those from nonstructural protein gene were first eliminated from the datasets. each dataset representing a single serotype was manually aligned using se-Al. a guide Neighbor-Joining tree was first built for each serotype. more than 20 of DENV-2 and a few of DENV-3 and DENV-4 in mainland China. the genetic diversity of dengue exhibited in Guangdong province is surprisingly large. DENV-1 DENV-2 DENV-3 DENV-4 Lineage Province (no. of clade*) Lineage Province (no. of clade) Lineage Province (no. of clade*) 2014 I GD Cosmopolitan GD (2) IV GD Asian II GD 2013 I GD (6); ZJ (2) Cosmopolitan GD (4) II GD; YN; Henan I ZJ IV GD (2); ZJ (2) Asian II GD III GD strains from mainland china were mostly clustered with those from southeast Asia countries, with occasional cases from the Indian subcontinent, south Pacific islands, Latin America, and Somalia. this was most obvious for DENV-1, with groupings ranging from 2006 to 2014, 2009 to 2014, 2010 to 2013, and 2002 to 2004. some clusters also included strains from other countries, such as shown in Figure 2B, confounding this interpretation. this kind of lineage replacement has also been reported in Mexico, where DENVs are considered endemic. however, annual replacement of lineages in Guangdong by imported DENVs does not exclude the possibility that this part of China is an integrated part of the southeast Asia and/or south Asia endemic region if transmission is two way. a total of 15 sub-lineages coded from A to O are annotated in Figure 5. the presence of sample from a particular country does not necessarily correspond to endemic transmission. rapid DENV movement has been observed among different cities of Guangdong province. in 2013, the cluster of DENV strains in the same clade, along with those from Laos 2013 (Supplemental Figure 3). the ability to rapidly spread and cause outbreaks in inner provinces such as Henan suggests that China is facing a substantial dengue threat with potential invasion into broader areas."}
