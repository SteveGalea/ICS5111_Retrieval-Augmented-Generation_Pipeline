{"summary": "MERS CoV has been a major public health challenge since it was first described in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. there is no effective treatment for this serious illness, which features a high mortality rate. METHODS Six patients with MERS CoV infection were included in this study. four cases with symptomatic disease, pneumonia, and respiratory failure were included in the study. 2 asymptomatic cases who were close contacts of the patients were included. patient (case number) Age (y) Sex Comorbid conditions Time to diagnosis (d) Time to treatment (d) Renal failure Hemodynamic instability Outcome 1 74 M Ischemic heart disease heart failure 18 19 + + Expired 2 84 M Right bundle branch block 12 12 + + Expired 3 76 M Cardiomyopathy heart failure 14 15 + + Expired 4 54 M None 2 2 Survived 5 48 F None 1 1 Survived 6 17 M three patients required ventilatory support, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. all 3 patients requiring ventilator support expired due to multiorgan failure. diagnosis of MERS CoV and treatment with ribavirin and IFN-2b delayed by an average of 14.7 days. people screened (3.7%) were positive for MERS CoV. none of the positive contacts were health care workers. the disease is emerging as a serious endemic illness associated with high mortality. in this series of 6 cases, fatal cases were of older ages and had comorbid conditions. they developed rapidly progressive respiratory and multisystem organ failure. none of the patients treated with ribavirin and IFN-2b developed any side effects or complications. findings suggest that humanto-human transmission is low."}
