{"summary": "importance of regional sites of policy formulation, regional conceptualizations and practice of health diplomacy, has lagged behind. in some ways, health diplomacy is still highly \u2018state centric\u2019, states at the apex of the global system viewing health as an arena that is increasingly linked to national interests and the defense of sovereignty. the practice of health diplomacy offers opportunities for non-state actors to set and implement policy agendas as well as regional organizations to advance new normative lines and problem-solving responses. the core of the diplomatic process in global health governance is giving way to multi-level and multi-dimensional relations among the actors addressing crossborder issues. sticky issues demonstrate that states do not have exclusive \u2018ownership\u2019 of an issue in the 21st century. it involves a multitude of actors in the process of its governance and diplomacy. context is the event that animates the issues into life; and multitude actors are agents that fragment global governance. actors emerge only in relation to other actors, mobilizes resources with different missions and objectives compared to that of others, and tries to accomplish something in relation to others. modern diplomacy is that \u2018pull\u2019 effect that builds partnership through negotiation, dialogues, and cooperation among a diversity of actors. the emergence of unofficial (non-state) diplomats was a significant product of the process of fragmentation. emergence of unofficial (non-state) diplomats was a significant product of the process of fragmentation. global diplomacy is changing in the presence of multiple actors in polycentric governance. argues that in the 21st century diplomacy, representation covers many more actors, communication handles faster speeds and larger volumes from multiple technological tools. but regional dimension has received less attention. the late 20th century witnessed the rising awareness of new trans-border issues that transformed the practice of diplomacy in international relations. the state-centric focus proved to be limited in addressing such issues, opening the way to innovative normative and practical grounds redefining opportunities to think and practice health governance in '21st century diplomacy' the \u2018push\u2019 effect is a natural tendency for diverging actors in claiming the opposite pole to differentiate themselves notably on the question of the extent to which sovereign rights are defended or bypassed. the push-pull effect creates an inverted-U effect of this 21st century diplomacy in an increasingly fragmented world. the pull effect may be a matter of a few years in some cases or a few decades in others. sometimes other actors act as a catalyst in initiating that pull effect which is in effect dialogue and negotiation between the diverging actors. the emergence of unofficial (non-state) diplomats was a significant product of the process of fragmentation. the classic work of Hedley Bull (1977) did point to this phenomenon in its definition of diplomats. however, it took the structural and systemic contradistinction between the fragmenting global governance and the traditional diplomacy. the gap is also a function of the contest between the problem-solving orientation of diplomacy at the apex of the global level and the dynamics at the regional level that highlight the need for the regional dimension as a driver for social redistribution. regional institutions in the global South have been carving out a place in this problem-solving dynamic. regional institutions in the global South have been increasingly carving out a place in this problem-solving dynamic. there is a large gap between the activities at the global and regional level. NGOs and regional organizations are often at a disadvantage in terms of outreach and institutional capacity. health diplomacy is profoundly affected by legal considerations during negotiation process. the regional dimension is coming into focus in this domain. discussions were held in a meeting between the 'Health 8' coordinating group. discussions were held on ways to cooperate on a range of issues. development countries often negotiate as a bloc against developed countries. 'right to health' provision, public health emergency due to AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases in developing countries, and high price of life-saving drugs and vaccines show developing countries have vested interest to strongly contest negotiations with developed countries. disagreement on the Annex 2 of the final text of IHR (2005) clearly demonstrated divergence between the North and the South. the developing countries argued that unless a list of diseases were specified in the IHR texts, they would be unable to get necessary financial support for disease surveillance. the pull effect weakens when a lack of institutional capacity within the developing countries acts as a functional problem. it challenges the South making the most efficient use of their resources in health diplomacy. developed countries bear transactional costs \u2013 for equity \u2013 of developing countries to enable them to govern. developed countries too have vested interest for soft-binding negotiated outcomes to avoid bearing transactional costs for other countries. global health diplomacy is Indonesia\u2019s suspension of virus sharing with WHO\u2019s influenza surveillance network in 2005. several states were not willing to discontinue certain national public health measures that were not supported by scientific studies. the united states created numerous objections during the negotiation process of the FCTC drafting on the ground of their constitutional rights. lateral cooperation points to its realization that security benefit is higher in cooperation than withholding information in fear of economic loss. global security interest can effectively work as a 'pull' effect when soft-binding negotiated clauses or outcomes accommodate reservations for national interest. a dynamic may accentuate the gap between the problem-solving approach favored by the core actors in the global system. the developments in health diplomacy with respect to the regional dimension reveal the salience of this normative contribution. the normative component extends the agenda into the sphere of social equity and social justice, a focus neglected by the problem-solving approach in health diplomacy. the most compelling terrain for the momentum toward a normative approach on health diplomacy, nonetheless, is emerging in the Americas, particularly in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) the aim of this article is to find out whether the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy are being reshaped in the health domain. the impact of this shift away from a subordination of the regional to the \u2018global\u2019 has serious consequences. this shift away from a subordination of the regional to the \u2018global\u2019 has been normative in nature."}
