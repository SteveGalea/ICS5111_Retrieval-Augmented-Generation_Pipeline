{"summary": "functional genomics was made possible by the development of DNA microarray technology [1\u20134], which made it possible for the first time to measure the RNA expression of thousands of genes in parallel, in a single assay. functional immunomics aims to identify the role of genes in cellular processes via the paradigm of specific cellular and humoral immune responses elicited by antigens. the field of functional immunomics has come of age as a result of advances in sequential immunomics. computational and statistical methods are now available for automated large-scale epitope prediction. a coordinated effort has been initiated by the national institute of allergy and infectious disease at the US national institutes of health. a discontinuous or conformational epitope is composed of several fragments scattered along the protein sequence. a conformational epitope is composed of several fragments scattered along the protein sequence. this may represent up to 90% of the total B cell responses. this makes prediction of B cell epitopes a hard problem. the most basic MHC-binding prediction methods are based on the identification of specific amino acids commonly found at particular positions, called binding motifs, within peptides that bind to a specific MHC molecule. however, all the amino acids of a peptide bound to an MHC groove can potentially play a positive or negative role in binding. these \u201cquantitative-matrix\u201d approaches have been very successful. ing prediction systems can incorporate nonlinear complex interactions between the MHC molecule and the peptide epitope, and evolve as more data is included in the training set. the greatest challenge is that, to be reliable, they require a larger amount of peptide-binding data. list of 71 articles covering the years from 1999 to the present. it is clear that interest in this field has accelerated. it is expected that the number of publications will increase at an exponential pace as immunomic microarrays became commercially available for research use. the initiative is designed to identify immune epitopes from selected infectious agents. the information will be made freely available to scientists worldwide through the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) peptide sequence is present at the surface of a protein based on hydrophilicity and secondary structures. peptides are bound by a specific groove in two main classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. a complicating factor is the highly polymorphic nature of the molecule. bound to an MHC groove (normally 8\u201310 amino acids for MHC I and 8\u201314 amino acids for MHC II) can potentially play a positive or negative role in binding. more complex methods assign positive or negative values for each amino acid at each position of a peptide. these \u201cquantitative-matrix\u201d approaches have been very successful. the greatest current challenge is the development of models incorporating the rules of B cell and T cell receptor engagement and their possible outcomes. the growth boom in immunomics took place in the 1990s and this field has now begun to enter a mature stage of development. genome-wide DNA sequences are deposited in large public-access databanks such as GenBank [18], and researchers or companies who make DNA microarrays use the sequences in these databases as probes. the field of functional immunomics has come of age as a result of advances in sequential immunomics. computational and statistical methods are now available for automated large-scale epitope prediction. a continuous or linear epitope is a sequential fragment from the protein sequence. a discontinuous or conformational epitope is composed of several fragments scattered along the protein sequence. this makes prediction of B cell epitopes a hard problem. computational epitope prediction methods have become essential for the systematic search for epitopes. ELISPOT and flow cytometry are effectively impractical due to the large number of peptides to be assayed. the most basic MHC-binding prediction methods are based on the identification of specific amino acids commonly found at particular positions, called binding motifs. quantitative-matrix scores have been generated for several HLA alleles. the greatest challenge is the development of models incorporating the rules of B cell and T cell receptor engagement and their possible outcomes. we obtained a list of 71 articles covering the years from 1999 to the present. it is clear interest in this field has accelerated, supporting the expectation of a continuing boom in growth. as immunomic microarray technology evolves, we expect that immunomic arrays with a small number of features will eventually be designed for specific clinical diagnostic purposes. arrays that we consider in detail in this paper are antibody, peptide, and peptide\u2013MHC microarrays. other functional immunomic approaches include dissociable antibody microarrays [48], cell microarrays [49,50], serum microarrays [51], peptide libraries [52,53], and serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries [54\u201358]. peptide microarrays essentially correspond to high-throughput parallelized ELISA assays [12,95\u201398] and thus can reveal the repertoire status of antigen-specific B cell antibody responses. however, peptide microarrays should ideally be used in parallel with extensive analysis of T cell responses. a panel of 225 selected peptides was used to study the profile of the autoantibody reactivity pattern of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. the autoimmune peptide array was used to study the profile of the autoantibody reactivity pattern of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. the RA study used serum from 18 RA patients, 38 healthy controls, and 58 recently diagnosed RA patients. peptide\u2013MHC microarrays are proposed for detecting T cells expressing receptors with affinity for specific peptide\u2013MHC complexes on the microarray. these include simple inspection of T cell clusters bound to a spot [9] or identification of activated cells secreting specific cytokines with cytokine-specific capture antibodies. peptide\u2013MHC microarrays correspond to high-throughput parallelized ELISPOT assays [19], particularly when low a third element can be the type of T cell population (e.g., T helper or CTL) that is used as a target. the choice between these three different elements will lead to a vast number of immunomic responses that can be measured. a single B cell epitope can be recognized by different isotypes of immunoglobulins. a high IgE titer in relation to IgG1 may be associated with allergy. the opposite, a high IgG1 titer in relation to IgE to the same epitope, is not. this is even more significant in the case of the peptide\u2013MHC array. the technology of peptide\u2013MHC microarrays is viewed as a simple and economical method for screening the T cell repertoire of a host [99] the first clinical research application of peptide\u2013MHC microarray technology was the study of the correlates of protection regarding the effects of an experimental therapeutic cancer vaccine. peptide\u2013MHC microarray response patterns showed that patients who presented both IFN- and TNF- secretory responses against a specific epitope remained free of melanoma. the total number of genes in humans is estimated to be 30,000; in comparison, the number of different T cell receptors in humans is estimated to be on the order of 107 to 1015. only 1% of these are able to bind to MHC molecules, which makes the number of interrogative features more manageable. the number of features is still very large, but methods to further reduce this number are essential. the goal of the immunomic array is to identify primed cells that have reached a reasonable level of precursor. a peptide\u2013MHC array incubated with 106 purified CD8+ cells (10 ml blood) could detect up to 100 reactive features that have reached minimum frequency of 1:10,000. however, if we expect to be able to detect rare clones, with very low frequencies, more cells would be needed. the authors used 106 cells and compared the limit of detection of the array with flow cytometry. it turned out that both had similar limits of sensitivity, approximately 1:10,000 cells or 0.01%. another great challenge is the polymorphism of HLA genes, in particular HLA class II. the large number of features that can be measured simultaneously with microarray technology also presents a challenge. on one hand, it is likely that a large number of irrelevant features will be present; on the other hand, the scientist would like to work with a small number of strong, relevant features. this problem of feature selection also arises due to a fundamental limitation in statistics, sometimes called the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. a set of features, corresponding to epitopes X and Y, have been identified via feature selection among the thousands of microarray probes. in this case, there are two class labels, corresponding to control and protected patients, in a situation in which protection is achieved by immunization with an attenuated-virus vaccine for a given infectious disease. the response to epitopes X and Y discriminates the patients protected by immunization from the control patients. the actual probability of classification error on future data typically exceeds the apparent error rate. the success of engineering and computational methodology in the physical realm is due to the predictive capability of mathematical modeling. the notion of regulatory networks arises as a fundamental concept in understanding the functioning of the immune system. most human diseases are the result of an unbalance in immune system homeostasis. peptide\u2013MHC microarrays are used in conjunction with three types of T cell targets. epitope A is specific to the CD4+ helper T cells that promote the response to epitope C. epitope B activates the CD4+ regulatory T cells that suppress the effector response to epitope C. the total number of possible states of the system is 23 = 8. for each attractor, there is associated a basin of attraction, containing attractors and transient states, which are the sets of states that lead to the attractor [108] in the context of biological systems, attractors are a mathematical model for homeostasis. the concept of master\u2013slave regulatory units is quite important for the understanding of complex regulatory systems. inference of immunomic regulatory networks from immunomic microarray data constitutes computational knowledge discovery. there are subtle epistemological issues involved in using data-driven methodology to obtain scientific knowledge. in this review we have often compared and contrasted immunomics with genomics. each cell has its own pattern of gene expression that defines its unique cellular properties. there exists a large collection of mathematical models to describe the immune system."}
