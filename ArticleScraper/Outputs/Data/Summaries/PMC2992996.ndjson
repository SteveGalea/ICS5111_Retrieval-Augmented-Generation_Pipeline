{"summary": "marine sponges are among the oldest multicellular invertebrate organisms [1] exhibiting a wide variety of colors and shapes. about 8,000 species of sponges inhabit different marine and freshwater ecosystems. some of these are secondary metabolites produced by the sponges. marine sponges are the source of many alkaloids, sterols, terpenes, peptides, fatty acids, peroxides, etc. exhibiting the remarkable chemical diversity of compounds found in these organisms [7,8] marine sponges are also the source of many alkaloids, sterols, terpenes, peptides, fatty acids, etc. it was the first nucleoside antiviral to be licensed for the treatment of systematic herpes virus infection. vidarabine is readily metabolized by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to arabinofuranosyl hypoxanthine (ara-H), which is 10-fold less potent [13,14] and has low lipophilicity. it is also poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and requires large fluid volumes for intravenous administration vidarabine inhibited the initial RNA polyadenylation reaction catalyzed by chromatin-bound poly (A) polymerase. it was also reported that vidarabine was 3\u20135 fold more active in plaque reduction assays against vaccinia and cowpox viruses than was cidofovir (Vistide) four analogues of mycalamides have been reported to bind the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus and inhibit its multiplication. it has also shown experimentally that these compounds might bind to the N-terminal 13-amino acid region of NP which mediates the nuclear transport of NP and its binding to viral RNA. avarol or its derivatives block synthesis of glutamine transfer tRNA. avarol plays a key role in early stages of viral infection, inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5\u2032-lipoxygenase. cyclooxygenase plays a key role in early stages of viral infection, inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5\u2032-lipoxygenase. alanine, threonine, two glycine residues, homoproline, N-methylthreonine, 3-methoxyalanine, -methoxytyrosine, 3-hydroxyleucine, 3,4-dimethylglutamine, 2,3-diaminobutanoic acid and an amide linked 2,3 dihydroxy-2,6,8-trimethyldeca-(4Z,6E)-dienoic acid were found to be papuamides C and D were found to be less potent with 30% and 55% inhibition at a concentration of 40 and 20 fold higher than papuamides A and B. the anti-HIV activity of crude extract of S. microspinosa was first discovered during the national cancer institute\u2019s primary anti-HIV screening. 4-methylaaptamine was found to inhibit HSV-1-infection in vero cells even 4 h after infection, suggesting the inhibition of initial events during HSV-1 replication. the compound showed in vitro antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HIV-1 with an EC50 of 96 M and 0.9 M respectively. manzamine A Manzamine A was isolated from Haliclona sp. found in waters near Okinawa by Sakai and Higa in their quest to find antitumor compounds from marine organisms. manzamine A has a low metabolic clearance, a reasonably long pharmacokinetic half-life, and good oral bioavailability. this study also reported the anti-HIV-1 activity of manzamine A, 8-hydroxymanzamine A, 6-deoxymanzamine X, and neokauluamine. it was the first nucleoside antiviral to be licensed for the treatment of systematic herpes virus infection. it is readily metabolized by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to arabinofuranosyl hypoxanthine (ara-H), which is 10-fold less potent [13,14] and has low lipophilicity and thus low intestinal membrane permeability. vidarabine is an inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis. vidarabine inhibited the initial RNA polyadenylation reaction catalyzed by chromatin-bound poly (A) polymerase. it was also recently reported that vidarabine was 3\u20135 fold more active in plaque reduction assays against vaccinia and cowpox viruses than was cidofovir (Vistide) four analogues of mycalamide A have recently been reported [36] to bind the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus and inhibit its multiplication. it has also shown experimentally that these compounds might bind to the N-terminal 13-amino acid region of NP which mediates the nuclear transport of NP. vidarabine is readily metabolized by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to arabinofuranosyl hypoxanthine (ara-H), which is 10-fold less potent [13,14] and has low lipophilicity and thus low intestinal membrane permeability. later acyclovir (Zovirax) was found to be a better drug than vidarabine for the treatment of herpes virus infections. stereocontrolled synthesis of vidarabine and several analogues/derivatives with antiviral activity has been described [24\u201326] mycalamide A, mycalamide B Perry et al. first reported isolation and in vitro antiviral activity of mycalamide A and mycalamide B from a new Zealand sponge of the genus Mycale in 1988 and 1990. sesquiterpene hydroquinones Avarol Avarol was first isolated from the marine sponge Disidea avara in 1974. it showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the replication of the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human T-lymphotropic retrovirus. the anti-viral activity of avarone has also been reported. the first enantioselective total synthesis of avarol was reported by Ling et al. studies dating back to 1988 showed the antiviral effects of avarol were due to an increase in intracellular levels of superoxide radicals. the effects of avarol were further elucidated and it was found that it completely blocks the synthesis of glutamine transfer tRNA. other important biological targets inhibited by avarol or its derivatives include reverse transcriptase [45] which plays a key role in early stages of viral infection. es, papuamides, were isolated from the sponges Theonella mirabilis and Theonella swinhoei that were collected along the north coast of Papua new Guinea. two groups independently reported the isolation of papuamides A and B from T. mirabilis and papuamides A, B, C, and D from T. swinhoei. papuamides C and D were found to be less potent with 30% and 55% inhibition at a concentration of 40 and 20 fold higher than papuamides A and B. the anti-HIV activity of crude extract of S. microspinosa was first discovered during the national cancer institute\u2019s primary anti-HIV screening. the anti-HIV and cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptides, papuamides, were isolated from the sponges Theonella mirabilis and Theonella swinhoei. two groups independently reported the isolation of papuamides A and B from T. mirabilis and papuamides A, B, C, and D from T. swinhoei. papuamides C and D were found to be less potent with 30% and 55% inhibition at a concentration of 40 fold higher than papuamides A and B. papuamides C and D were found to be less potent with 30% and 55% inhibition at a concentration of 40 and 20 fold higher than papuamides. based in vitro assay and found to be effective at a concentration of 0.2 g/mL in CEM-SS arget cells. other cyclic depsipeptides from sponges with anti-HIV activity also reported. dragmacidin F was isolated from a marine sponge of the genus Halicortex. it demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HIV-1. the compound is most likely responsible for the antiviral property exhibited by Halicortex extracts. I activity of this compound with a minimal effective concentration of 0.05 g/mL has been reported from other species of marine sponges. a more recent study describes the isolation of manzamine A from an undescribed sponge of the genusAcanthostrongylophora from manado Bay, Indonesia. 4-Methylaaptamine was found to inhibit HSV-1-infection in Vero cells even 4 h after infection. the compound could inhibit expression of an HSV-1 immediate-early protein, ICP27, which regulates splicing, termination, and nuclear export of viral transcripts thus preventing viral replication. the manzamine class of alkaloids has unique complex polycyclic ring systems coupled with a -carboline moiety. it has been reported to have a diverse range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial [70,71], antiparasitic [72], antipesticidal [73], and anti-HIV-1 and activity against AIDS opportunistic infections. Phenolic Macrolides Hamigeran B This compound (Figure 9) was isolated from the marine sponge Hamigera tarangaensis (family Anchinoidae) from the Hen and Chicken Islands in new Zealand. showed 100% in vitro virus inhibition against both the herpes and polio virus with only slight cytotoxicity at a concentration of 132 g per disk. most of the pharmaceutically interesting compounds found in sponges are present in minute amounts. in order to obtain even 300 mg of halichondrins, a potent cytostatic polyketide of sponge origin, a metric ton of the sponge Lissodendoryx sp. must be extracted. a large amount of biomass of marine sponges cannot be harvested from nature. only 0.06 and 0.1% of total bacteria could be cultured from sponges Candidaspongia flabellate [99] and Rhopaloeides odorabile [97] microorganisms isolated from sponges may not necessarily produce the same compound due to the requirement of intermediate compound/s from the host. some bacteria also stop producing the compound of interest after a certain time on artificial media. a new molybdenum-containing oxidoreductase and transmembrane proteins were identified [110] and a new molybdenum-containing oxidoreductase and transmembrane proteins were identified. the gene clusters identified using metagenomics approach is a step forward towards solving the problem of mass production of relevant natural products. metagenomics approach has been successfully developed and implicated to known polyketide synthase genes in an effort to identify new polyketides. phylogenetic approaches can be applied to study the structure and function of biosynthetic enzymes."}
