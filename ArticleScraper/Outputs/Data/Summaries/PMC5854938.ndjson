Dr Bandar Alknawy, chief executive officer of the MNGHA, and Dr Ahmed Alaskar, executive director of KAIMRC, welcomed the speakers, presenters, and attendees. the conference is in alignment with the plan to reduce dependency on oil, diversify the economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation and tourism professor Bountra gave an overview of how the SGC is overcoming these challenges by doing the following: i) working with a large number of pharmaceutical companies to develop high-quality small-molecule inhibitors. the SGC has already facilitated proprietary efforts in pharma, catalyzed the creation of new biotech, and accelerated numerous clinical studies. the second talk, delivered by Dr Omar Abdulhameed Al Mazroo, was entitled \u2018Phase I clinical trials in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Are we ready\u2019. the SFDA has become a leading regulatory body in the Gulf Cooperation Council area. most common cancers are currently being revisited on the basis of modern molecular portraits that allow the identification of new molecular subtypes and therapeutic opportunities. most common cancers are currently being revisited on the basis of modern molecular portraits that allow the identification of new molecular subtypes. characterization of the genomic and immune changes that drive an individual patients disease is critical to inform rationally targeted therapies and treatment planning for patients with advanced cancer. the successful execution of a clinical trial requires a team of experts, strong collaboration and careful planning. he suggested that there is a need for an 'Early Drug Development Unit' that will improve the resources investment and strengthen the 'Accelerated Drug Development' program. emphasized that the success of translational research is not only a function of the quality of the science, but also of the collaboration between academia and industry. merger of phase I and II trials will lead to basket trials and larger phase I trials. the success of this merger will depend on the rigor of both preclinical development and clinical trial design. clinical equipoise is widely viewed as essential for an ethical randomized clinical trial. the goal of \u2018intervention and control\u2019 should be to maximize benefit and minimize harm. professor alkawi outlined guidelines for international collaborations. he also suggested that a \u2018Research Ethics Monitoring Office\u2019 should be connected with the NCBE and responsible for enforcing research ethics during a clinical trial. clinical trials have changed the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer opting for organ-preserving treatment. sain discussed the role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. he also discussed the role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. a good selection of biomarkers, precise statistics, an efficient study design, and thorough knowledge of the published data are factors that significantly increase the chances of a successful clinical trial. professor Yaseen Arabi gave a talk that focused on two clinical trials he conducted on MERS-CoV-infected patients. the SGC has already facilitated proprietary efforts in pharma, catalyzed the creation of new biotech, and accelerated numerous clinical studies. professor Chas Bountra gave an overview of how the SGC is overcoming these challenges. professor Bountra ended his talk by saying that \u2018together we are creating a new ecosystem for drug discovery\u2019. he said that \u2018together we are creating a new ecosystem for drug discovery. one which we believe will accelerate the generation of more novel \u2018precision\u2019 medicines, quickly. the SFDA has become a leading regulatory body in the Gulf Cooperation Council area. the priority of the SFDA is to provide clear regulations and guidelines for the first in-human clinical trials based on current global practice. clinical trials will use genomic and proteomics approaches to discover molecular-targeted therapies and develop an adequate molecular characterization of each patients cancer. the final objective of this trial is to improve outcomes. the acid test of phases I/II is a critical moment in drug development. professor Sayed Hussain discussed the importance of infrastructure, teamwork, research facilities and strong collaboration for the success of drug development. he addressed the need for a strong \u2018Clinical Research Unit\u2019, \u2018Pharmacology Unit\u2019 and \u2018Good Clinical Laboratory Practice Laboratory Facilities\u2019 for successful translational research during the early to late phases of clinical trials. clinical trial design must continue to evolve to take advantage of this ever-expanding body of knowledge. he suggested the use of deep sequencing to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying differences during drug development. the Nuremberg Code of 1947 comprises principles such as informed consent, proper scientific experimentation, and fruitful results for society. in 1964, the Declaration of Helsinki introduced flexibility of the conditions of consent, which was inflexible in the Nuremberg code. the talk focused on research regulations in the KSA. the \u2018ethics\u2019 exist because of we are humans and the \u2018regulations\u2019 refer to the laws of land. the'regulations\u2019 refer to the laws of land. the results of these clinical trials have changed the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer opting for organ-preserving treatment. the results of these clinical trials have changed the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer opting for organ-preserving treatment. is experimental and clinical collaboration in early phase clinical trials. this paradigm shift to experimental medicine, he opined, has social and economic dividends due to the ecosystem of diverse expertise and skill set required. professor Julen Oyarzabal discussed the role of epigenetics in cancer. he developed two methyltransferase inhibitors and showed the effect of these inhibitors on leukemia and B-cell lymphoma. the efficacy of these small molecules was tested both in vitro and in different animal models. the SGC has already facilitated proprietary efforts in pharma, catalyzed the creation of new biotech, and accelerated numerous clinical studies. i) building major collaborations with patient groups, key clinicians, hospitals, and large academic drug-discovery centers to catalyze more clinical \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 studies. the SFDA has become a leading regulatory body in the Gulf Cooperation Council area. the aim of the SFDA is to provide clear regulations and guidelines for the first in-human trials based on current global practice. clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the concept of personalized and molecular medicine. these trials will use genomic and proteomics approaches to discover molecular-targeted therapies and develop an adequate molecular characterization of each patients cancer. the final objective of this trial is to improve outcomes. the introduction of new technologies in the world of precision medicine may significantly reduce the duration of clinical trials. the introduction of new technologies in the world of precision medicine may significantly reduce the duration of clinical trials. clinical trial design must continue to evolve to take advantage of this ever-expanding body of knowledge. proposed merger of phase I and II trials will lead to basket trials and larger phase I trials. clinical research has expanded tremendously in the past few decades. he stressed ethical concerns during clinical trials involve consideration of both general and trial-specific ethics. for a clinical trial, the research question should be important and answerable. clinical equipoise is widely viewed as essential for an ethical randomized clinical trial. the goal of \u2018intervention and control\u2019 should be to maximize benefit and minimize harm. the participation of vulnerable patients in clinical trials raises an ethical dilemma that needs alternatives to informed consent. the costliest step during drug discovery and development is the clinical trial because it uses humans to test the safety and efficacy of the novel therapeutics under investigation. the aim of this session was to discuss both the costs and rewards of clinical trials, with a focus on phase I trials. professor Hussain discussed the results of his work on split-dose cisplatin. it has extended the spectrum of patients eligible for such treatment to include even those with impaired renal function. he concluded that the landscape of bladder cancer therapies is continuously changing. professor Yaseen Arabi gave a talk that focused on two clinical trials he conducted on MERS-CoV-infected patients. in the first trial, Professor Arabi used the convalescent plasma of recovered donors as a passive immunotherapy for MERS-CoV infection. he showed that this methodology has a limited efficiency because of the small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers. a dedicated session was meant to bridge the gap between pre-clinical drug discoveries and phase II clinical trials. the sessions were presented by four speakers: Dr Sheraz Gul (Head of Drug Discovery, Fraunhofer, Germany), Dr Jiang Dong (Executive Director; Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China), Dr Abeer Alshukairi (Consultant in Adult infectious disease; King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Jeddah, KSA) preventing PCSK9 from binding the LDLr offers the potential to lower blood LDL levels. berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt of the proto-berberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. it has gained the attention of the scientific community due to its ability to treat arrhythmia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and cancer. a panel discussion was initiated to give recommendations and tips to KAIMRC. the discussion included advice on how to attract companies to contribute to the initiation of clinical trials. the most challenging part of therapeutics discovery is to identify the target that is the cause of the disease. dr Rana Rais presented a well-known glutamine antagonist, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), which has been used in preclinical and clinical studies. her laboratory has synthesized analogs of DON to improve its efficacy and help alleviate its associated gastrointestinal toxicity. extract of shrub called Calligonum comosum showed a dose-dependent inhibition of migration and induced cell death compared with untreated cells. more work is underway to study composition and mode of action of calligonum comosum extract. nanoemulsions are made on a nanoscale level to improve the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients. nanoemulsions may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and minimize their adverse effects and toxicities. major applications include biomedical imaging, treatment of infection of the reticuloendothelial system, enzyme replacement therapy in the liver, and vaccination. the results from his laboratory indicate that OSAL-deficient patients may be more susceptible to non-viral infections than healthy individuals. these changes may explain the partial developmental delay in OASL-deficient patients symptoms. clinical trials involving ex vivo stimulation of autologous tumor-infiltrating T-cells. he emphasized that successful adoptive T-cell therapy is dependent on the ability of the infused lymphocytes to travel to the tumor site and mediate tumor destruction. this approach is subject to many challenges, including: the identification of suitable targets, tumor antigen heterogeneity, \u2018on-target and off-tumor\u2019 toxicity. this approach can be defined as developing \u2018targeted therapies without specific targets\u2019. this approach fails to address the biologic complexity of breast cancer. there is a need to rethink strategies for the development of biologic modifiers. the high rate of relapse, usually associated with refractory disease, necessitates the development of novel treatments. the main adverse effects were cytokine release syndrome and 'on-target off-tumor toxicity' a dedicated session was meant to bridge the gap between pre-clinical drug discoveries and phase II clinical trials. a dedicated session was presented by four speakers: Dr Sheraz Gul (Head of Drug Discovery, Fraunhofer, Germany), Professor Jiang Dong (Executive Director; Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China), Dr Abeer Alshukairi (Consultant in Adult infectious disease), and Dr Imadul Islam (Senior ary ammonium salt of the proto-berberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids is extracted from Chinese plants. the drug is being used as an anti-diabetic agent, and has provided insights into new potential targets in this area of research. the association of the target to the disease needs to be validated by number of approaches, including genomics and in vivo animal testing using multiple techniques. once the target is identified, it will be used to identify hits in the form of small molecules, antibodies, mRNAs, and others agents. a new, naturally transformed cell line, KAIMRC1, is isolated from the breast tumor of an Arab woman aged 62 years. the cell line is estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-negative. the epithelial nature of this cell was confirmed by flow cytometry using epithelial cell markers. the methanolic extract of the shrub showed a dose-dependent inhibition of migration and induced cell death compared with untreated cells. more work is underway to study the composition and mode of action of Calligonum comosum extract. culoendothelial system, enzyme replacement therapy in the liver, treatment of cancer, and vaccination. molecular crystals were long considered a \u2018chemical cemetery\u2019, with limited use in chemistry, material science, or medicine. chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CART) is a type of adoptive cell therapy that was initially restricted to small clinical trials mainly involving patients with advanced blood cancer. but because of the significant outcomes of this treatment, researchers are exploring its efficacy on other types of cancer. professor Hawkins is using preclinical models to examine the potential toxicity of this treatment. he shared his experience of developing clinically applicable systems to reduce the toxicity of supportive therapy and control the function of T-cells in vivo. the need for \u2018correlations\u2019 between theses \u2018profiles\u2019 and the efficacy of/resistance to therapies will require access to powerful bioinformatics processes and adapted software. the ultimate aim is to build \u2018individual dynamic blood tumor mappings\u2019 leading to a \u2018Breast Cancer Translational Platform\u2019. the main adverse effects were cytokine release syndrome and 'on-target off-tumor toxicity' the last speaker of this conference was Ms. Balkese Alhammad. the process can take up to five years and cost around 5\u201310 million US dollars. the drug is being used as an anti-diabetic agent and has provided insights into new potential targets in this area. Dr Abeer Alshukairi presented the symptoms of MERS-CoV. he showed how MERS-CoV induces cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 T-cells in hospitalized intensive care unit patients. this finding has added to our understanding of the effect of MERS-CoV. genomic data mining and target identification involve computational science, which may be compound-, patient- or population-centric. he presented a case study of prostate cancer using three attributes: disease-specific, small-molecule, and cell-surface targets. a new, naturally transformed cell line, KAIMRC1, is isolated from the breast tumor of an Arab woman aged 62 years. the cell line was characterized for its biologic and molecular markers, induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and response to different commercially available drugs. the epithelial nature of this cell was confirmed by flow cytometry using epithelial cell markers. advances in nanomedicine may provide numerous improvements to drug efficacy, including bioavailability, targeting ability, and safety. professor Thierry Vandamme delivered a talk about nanoemulsions as a strategic platform for innovative drug delivery systems. major applications include biomedical imaging, treatment of infection of the reticuloendothelial system, enzyme replacement therapy in the liver, and vaccination. OASL-deficient patient blood samples showed reduced levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and Vascular endothelial growth factor. OASL deficiency results in reduced migration of macrophages and lymphocytes compared with their normal counterparts. professor Robert Hawkins discussed an exciting area of immunotherapy in his talk \u2018Developing Adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer: Achievements and Challenges to Treat Solid Tumors\u2019. he presented preclinical models indicating the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapy. knowledge of cancer biology is exploding, with the identification of multiple biologic targets leading to the potential availability of numerous targeted therapies in the clinic. however, the translation to patient care remains sketchy. this paradox is explained by the present principles of breast cancer therapy and strategies for the development of new biologic modifiers. the ultimate aim is to build \u2018individual dynamic blood tumor mappings\u2019 leading to a \u2018Breast Cancer Translational Platform\u2019. Dr AbdulWajid Abdulwajid delivered a talk entitled \u2018Challenges of Antibody Generation, Clone Development followed by Manufacturing of Antibodies\u2019. most of the targeted therapies used to treat breast cancer cannot treat TNBC patients. immunotherapy is the strategy most likely to cure TNBC."}
