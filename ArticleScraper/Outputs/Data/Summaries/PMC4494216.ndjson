{"summary": "microbial pathogens (viruses, bacteriae, etc.) have been used for induction of antigen-specific responses that protect the host against subsequent infections. peptide vaccines can be used for induction of broad-spectrum immunity against multiple serological variants or strains of a given pathogen. there are many peptide vaccines under development, such as vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [11], hepatitis C virus [12], malaria [13], foot and mouth disease [14], swine fever [15], influenza [16], anthrax [17], human papilloma virus [18], therapeutic anti-cancer vaccines [19,20,21,22,23,24]. diseases such as HIV, HCV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Pneumonia, Genital Herpes, Hand foot and Mouth disease are either under Phase II or Phase I stage of development. however, the commercialization of a licensed peptide vaccine has yet to be realized. immunodominant epitopes can be chosen in context of B cells, cytotoxic or helper T cells. one of the most suited approaches is preparation of protective monoclonal antibody against the conserved regions. vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as viruses or against cancers may focus on the identification of epitopes that induce cytotoxic T cell responses. bioinformatics tools are used for prediction including, but not limited to, the translocation of peptides into endoplasmic reticulum (MHC-I), binding of antigen to MHC I and MHC II, and recognition by T cell receptors. multiple epitope predictive algorithms have been developed as briefly described below: (1) Structural resolution of desired antigen and its monoclonal antibody complex. prediction of linear B cell epitopes using computerized algorithms such as propensity scale, machine-learning algorithm or combination of these two, hybrid algorithm, ABCpred, ANN-, BepriPred, HMM or more advanced algorithms are BEDDPRo, SVM, PSSM etc. IMGT HLA database gives information of MHC alleles and its polymorphism and distribution in the community. peptide vaccine antigens are followed by chemical synthesis of antigenic peptides. the synthesized peptides are then conjugated to carrier molecules or adjuvants. the first synthetic peptide vaccine providing protection came from studies of canine parvovirus in dogs. peptide vaccines have been designed to use for tumor therapeutic applications. peptide-based vaccines have been designed to use for tumor therapeutic applications. peptide vaccines have been designed to use for tumor therapeutic applications. the LCMV 15-mer synthetic long peptide vaccination study revealed that the effectiveness of LCMV 15-mer peptides to induce LCMV-specific CD8 T cell reactivity depended on CD4 T-cell help. similar results came from a HPV16 E7 peptide vaccination study in which the HPV16 E7 peptide vaccine in Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant failed to induce strong peptide-specific CD8 T-cell response in MHC-II knock the induction of robust CD8+ T cell and/or antibody responses requires cytokine help from CD4+ T cells. peptide vaccines must consider promoting peptide secondary structure in order to induce a specific humoral response. modern day particulate delivery systems are aimed at overcoming shortcomings of the age old adjuvant, alum. the specific limitations of alum were: lack of cellular immune system stimulation, degradation on freeze drying and the possibility of adverse local reactions. emulsions are based on a common mechanism of action of formation of a depot at the injection site that is capable of attracting the immune cells. papillomaviruses (HPV) E6, E7 [65,66] MF59TM o/w emulsion with squalene oil dispersed with the help of surfactants viz. polysorbate 80 and sorbitan oleate Great safety profile, able to activate immune cells directly Melanoma Peptides. a novel w/o/o multiple emulsion system containing squalene oil encapsulating peptide antigen gp100 was investigated for its efficacy as a vaccine delivery system for melanoma immunotherapy. other modifications of the emulsion system to increase adjuvancy include DepoVax and GLA-SE. liposomes are a less preferred choice for peptide antigens because of their lower entrapment efficiency. liposomes may have an effect on the quantity and quality of the immune response produced by them, e.g., cholesterol in liposomes at and above a threshold of 20 mol % cholesterol was found to play a role in the induction of a peptide-specific immunological response. hepatitis C virus derived peptides coupled to surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with the establishment of long term memory [72,75] the results obtained in this study were replicated with OVA antigen [75] and found to produce a long lived CD8+ T cells without CD4+ T cells. liposomes can be made positively charged (cationic liposomes), coated with polyethylene glycol (PEGs) to promote ationic liposomes larger in size (>2 m) were found to promote proliferation and low IL-10 production. liposomes of size around 500 nm were found to promote IFN- and IL-1B production. liposomes can be made pH sensitive or integrated with fusogenic peptides. virosomes comprise 70% of naturally occurring phospholipids and 30% envelop phospholipids originating from the influenza virus. at the time of production the influenza surface antigens neuraminidase and hemagglutinin are integrated into the liposomal bilayer. ISCOMs and ISCOMATRIXTM are composed of phospholipids as liposomes but also contain saponin adjuvant Quil A. strategies to encapsulate hydrophilic antigens into ISCOMS include coupling of antigens to ISCOMs using amphipathic coupling protein. polymers have been investigated for the delivery of the vaccines. polymeric micro and nanoparticles are known to promote uptake, transport, or presentation of antigen to APCs. the biggest advantage offered by polymer based antigen delivery systems is the sustained release (for a period of few weeks to months) of the encapsulated antigen from the polymer matrix. hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic forces, van der Waal forces, or combinations of these interactions are available as the driving forces for the formation of polymer complexes. chitosan is a naturally occurring ideal polymer because of its nontoxic nature, biocompatibility and biodegradability. to produce a Th1 response specifically IL-12, a Th-1 inducing cytokine was added to viscous solution of chitosan and it generated higher antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. PLGA microparticles were coated with water soluble chitosan and conjugated with CKS9 as a model vaccine against swine dysentery. lipid-calcium-phosphate nanoparticles are examples of multifunctional nanoparticles that are able to deliver their cargo intracellularly into the cytoplasm leading to a CTL response. ed peptide SIINFEKL was derived from albumin. in polyphosphazene microparticles a truncated secreted version of the F protein (F) was then encapsulated with a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and an innate defense regulator (IDR) peptide. other smart microparticles have been formulated with influenza A matrix protein. a number of natural and synthetic compounds have been shown to exhibit adjuvant activity. many of them are more toxic for human use when compared to alum. MF59 is composed of squalene, was produced by Novartis vaccines and diagnostics Inc. ed in over 33,000 doses being administered to over 12,000 individuals. MPL is also the first and only TLR ligand in licensed human vaccines. such technologies can now be considered for particulate peptide vaccine delivery. safety of the vaccines delivered via the particulate delivery system is usually established by giving repeated administration of the vaccine at therapeutic or elevated doses. the criteria that is used to evaluate safety may include immediate adverse events (AE) reported within 30 min of vaccination; solicited and unsolicited AEs, serious AEs and clinical laboratory safety measurements [117]. human papillomaviruses (HPV) E6, E7 [65,66] MF59TM o/w emulsion with squalene oil dispersed with the help of surfactants viz. polysorbate 80 and sorbitan oleate Great safety profile, able to activate immune cells directly Melanoma Peptides. a novel w/o/o multiple emulsion system containing squalene oil encapsulating peptide antigen gp100 was investigated for its efficacy as a vaccine delivery system for melanoma immunotherapy. other modifications of the emulsion system to increase the adjuvancy include DepoVax and GLA-SE. liposomes are a less preferred delivery system for peptide antigens because of their lower entrapment efficiency. liposomes may have an effect on the quantity and quality of the immune response produced by them, e.g., cholesterol in liposomes at and above a threshold of 20 mol %. liposomes surface decorated with peptides derived from a non-structural polyprotein in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus. hepatitis c virus derived peptides coupled to surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with the establishment of long term memory [72,75] liposomes of size around 500 nm were found to promote proliferation and low IL-10 production. liposomes of size around 500 nm were found to promote IFN- and IL-1B production. colloids to liposomes are virosomes, transfersomes, archeosomes, niosomes and cochleates. virosomes comprise 70% of naturally occurring phospholipids and 30% envelop phospholipids originating from the influenza virus. virosomes are composed of assembled viral membrane protein which render them enhanced binding to APCs. ISCOMATRIXTM is a particulate adjuvant comprising cholesterol, phospholipid and saponin but without antigen. strategies to encapsulate hydrophilic antigens into ISCOMS include coupling of antigens to ISCOMs using amphipathic coupling protein. polymeric micro and nanoparticles are known to promote uptake, transport, or presentation of antigen to APCs. the biggest advantage offered by polymer based antigen delivery systems is the sustained release (for a period of few weeks to months) of the encapsulated antigen from the polymer matrix. chitosan is a naturally occurring ideal polymer because of its nontoxic nature, biocompatibility and biodegradability. the natural polymer, chitosan, has been known to enhance the bioavailability of the antigens due to a mucoadhesive property. PLGA microparticles were coated with water soluble chitosan. they were entrapped with submicron oil-in-water emulsion MF 59. lipid-calcium-phosphate nanoparticles are examples of multifunctional nanoparticles that can deliver their cargo intracellularly into the cytoplasm leading to a CTL response. in polyphosphazene microparticles a truncated secreted version of the F protein (F) was then encapsulated with a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and an innate defense regulator (IDR) peptide. these microparticles developed significantly higher levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the sera and lungs, and higher numbers of IFN- secreting cells. as adjuvants, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipophilic phospholipid (lipid A) exhibit adjuvant activity. many of them are more toxic for human use when compared to alum. there are several new approvals for human vaccines from FDA and Europe. clinical trials carried out on MPL have resulted in over 33,000 doses being administered to over 12,000 individuals. a history of safe and effective use in licensed human vaccines, such technologies can now be considered for particulate peptide vaccine delivery. the transdermal route of administration plays a vital role in toxicity determination. the safety of the vaccines delivered via the particulate delivery system is usually established by giving repeated administration of the vaccine at therapeutic or elevated doses. the criteria that is used to evaluate safety may include immediate adverse events (AE) reported within 30 min of vaccination; solicited and unsolicited AEs, serious AEs and clinical laboratory safety measurements. peptide vaccine technology has the potential to grow into the next generation of subunit vaccines."}
