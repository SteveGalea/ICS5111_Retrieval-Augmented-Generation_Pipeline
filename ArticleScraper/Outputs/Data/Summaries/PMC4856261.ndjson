{"summary": "nudix hydrolases regulate the levels of a wide variety of canonical and modified nucleotides and some non-nucleotide phosphorylated substrates. a further range of enzymes is able to do so in plants, fungi and bacteria [5\u20137] a number of proteins including a multiprotein complex containing DNA polymerase- [24, 25], protein kinases [26\u201328], uracil-DNA glycosylase [29], protein chaperones [30], the HINT1 tumor suppressor [31], 5\u2032-nucleotidase II [32], CBS domain proteins [33, 34] and CFIm25 [35] are interested in the possibility that Ap4A may act as a transcriptional regulator reference clone B (product no. P00174E07) and the KBM-7-NuKO derivative (P01289H04) were obtained from Haplogen and maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% (v/v) CO2/air in modified Eagle medium (IMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) Foetal Bovine Serum (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma) and 100 g mL -1 penicillin-s RNA extraction was performed using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit with QIAshredder. for each of the six samples, 10 g of RNA was DNase-treated using an Ambion TURBO DNA-freeTM kit. 2 g of the total RNA was then subjected to rRNA depletion using the Ribo-Zero Gold (Human/Mouse/Rat) kit and subsequently purified using AMPure XP raw fastq files were processed using CASAVA 1.8.2 (Illumina) raw fastq files were processed using Cutadapt 1.2.1 [40] with option \u201c-O 3\u201d set to remove adapter sequences of 3 bp or more. reads were further trimmed using Sickle 1.200 to remove low quality bases and finally reads 10 bp were removed. RT-PCR analysis of selected genes RNA extraction was performed using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit with QIAshredder. cDNA was synthesized using a Bioline Tetro cDNA synthesis kit. the cDNA was then quantitated by PCR using a stepOnePlusTM real time PCR system. -NuKO derivative (P01289H04) were obtained from Haplogen and maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% (v/v) CO2/air in modified Eagle medium (IMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) Foetal Bovine Serum (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma) and 100 g mL -1 penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) RNA extraction was performed using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit with QIAshredder. 10 g of RNA was DNase-treated using an Ambion TURBO DNA-freeTM kit. 2 g of the DNase-treated total RNA was then subjected to rRNA depletion using the Ribo-Zero Gold (Human/Mouse/Rat) kit. raw fastq files were processed using Cutadapt 1.2.1 [40] with option \u201c-O 3\u201d set to remove adapter sequences of 3 bp or more. reads were further trimmed using Sickle 1.200 to remove low quality bases and finally reads 10 bp were removed. iagen RNeasy mini kit with QIAshredder and cDNA was synthesized using a Bioline Tetro cDNA synthesis kit. the cDNA was quantitated by PCR using a stepOnePlusTM real time PCR system. the 2-Ct method was used to determine relative transcript levels using the housekeeping gene to normalize the data. the total absence of NUDT2 protein from the nuKO NUDT2 disruptant was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig 1). the steady-state concentration of intracellular Ap4A in unstressed mammalian cells is typically in the range 0.1\u20131.0 pmol/106 cells (0.05\u20130.5 M), the exact amount being species- and cell type-dependent. a sample of recombinant NUDT2 and protein extracts of KBM-7 and KBM-7 nuKO cells was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography. a nucleotide extract from NuKO cells was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography and fractions assayed luminometrically for Ap4A. 31,177 (48.5%) of the 64,253 reference genes had at least one read aligned while 33,076 genes had no read aligned from any of the six samples. all percentages were calculated based on total number of reads to align. correlation coefficients in Fig 2B indicated that expression profiles for the three samples from the same cell type were much more closely correlated than samples from different cell types. the effect of NUDT2 knockout on gene expression was much stronger than the influence of any technical or biological variations between samples. the heatmap also shows a very high correlation (R >0.99) among samples from the same cell type. the 40 most strongly down- and up-regulated genes in KBM7-NuKO cells are shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. many of these genes had zero read counts for either the WT or KO datasets.

OVOL1 is up-regulated 719-fold in nuKO cells. ZEB1 and ZEB2 are slightly down 1.4- and 1.2-fold respectively. the secreted glycoprotein EDIL3 has recently been identified as a novel inducer of EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma. high expression of the HSP40 family member DNAJC12 has been found to correlate with colorectal tumor progression and invasion. it is down-regulated 41-fold in nuKO cells. overexpression of NKD3 promotes an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells. up-regulation of IFI44L is associated with melanoma and prostate cancer. overexpression of NKX2-2 is associated with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and fibromatosis. NKX3-1 is a prostate tumor suppressor and its expression is increased 13-fold in nuKO cells. chemokine CXCL10 is another factor with both tumor-promoting and anti-tumor effects. it is overexpressed up to 40-fold in most types of cancer and can promote tumor cell growth and metastasis. mixed results have also been reported for the Ig superfamily protein CD200 and the transmembrane co-receptor syndecan-4. IDO1 and several other enzymes of Trp catabolism are strongly down-regulated in nuKO cells. increased expression is a characteristic of many cancer cells and assists them in avoiding clearance by the immune system. there seems to be sufficient evidence to support NUDT2 as a novel chemotherapeutic target that could exert an anti-cancer effect via multiple pathways. new tab Growth inhibition curves for cells in the presence of (A) methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), (B) N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and (C) N-methylnitrosourea (MNU) data are presented as means SEM of the results obtained from three independent experiments. top-ranked upstream transcription factors (in centre) suggested by IPA\u00ae for the set of down-regulated genes (outer circle) top two-ranked cytokines, IFNA2 and IFNL1 are also included. the level of PDLIM2 expression in KBM-7 cells was not significantly affected by NUDT2 knockout. however, there is no clear upstream pattern of regulation for the sets of up-regulated genes. IPA\u00ae may have identified potential upstream regulatory factors. USF2 or HINT1 (down 1.3-fold) as potential regulators in our study. TPSB2 was up 3.2-fold but KIT was down 2.3-fold. no data were retrieved for GZMB. no clear evidence to support relief of HINT1 repression of transcription factors as a cause of Ap4A-mediated differential gene expression in KBM-7 cells. all known P2 receptor subtypes except P2X3, P2X6, P2Y4, P2Y12 and P2Y13 were found to be expressed in KBM-7 cells with P2X1, P2X7 and P2Y8 showing slight but significant up-regulation. an elevated level of Ap4A could conceivably regulate, or interfere with, these processes leading to changes in gene regulation. however, the lack of effect on the expression of the selected gene set studied by qRT-PCR after inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 would argue against a major role for PARPs. nudix protein NUDT21 binds to same site as RNA with a Kd of 2.4 M. it could affect 3\u2032-end processing and the half-lives of certain mRNAs. transcripts affected after NUDT21 knockdown in glioblastoma cells. heterodinucleoside polyphosphates such as Ap4G and Ap4U can also be synthesized by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. no specific mechanisms are known for the synthesis of Gp4G and other homodinucleoside polyphosphates in mammalian cells. transcript stability could also be affected if NUDT2 were involved in mRNA decapping. NUDT2 has also been reported to bind to unliganded estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) in the cytosol. this is interesting given the reported repression of NUDT2 expression by estradiol [78, 159]. however, it seems unlikely that the effects of NUDT2 disruption involve ESR2-mediated gene expression. log phase KBM-7 cells had a level of 0.210.02 (n = 3) pmol/106 cells. however, the nuKO derivative had a 175-fold increased level of 36.90.3 (n = 3) pmol/106 cells. this provides the clearest evidence yet that Ap4A is an important NUDT2 substrate in vivo. a sample of recombinant NUDT2 and protein extracts of KBM-7 and KBM-7 nuKO cells was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography and fractions assayed luminometrically for Ap4A. an average of 46.1 million pairs of 100 bp paired-end reads per sample were generated that aligned to the reference human genome. % reads aligned in pairs % concordant pairsb KBM7.1 52,648,492 46,517,676 88.4 42,437,310 80.6 70.7 KBM7.2 48,836,484 43,222,156 88.5 39,472,258 80.8 70.5 KBM7.3 53,927,610 47,635,707 88.3 43,402,072 80.5 70.8 N2KO.1 63,959,114 MA plot of differential gene expression data shows the 2nd and 3rd principal components. the three samples from wild type KBM-7 cells are labeled WT1-WT3 and those from the KBM-7-NuKO cells KO1-KO3. gene name Fold change FDR-P, KO vs WT1 FPKM KO2 GFRA1 GDNF family receptor alpha 1 3221.0 4.38E-298 2.548 0.000 ZNF660 zinc finger protein 660 1785.1 5.30E-174 2.094 0.000 DZIP1 DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 1364.6 0.00E+00 10.206 0.007 CROT carnitine O-octanoyltransferase chromosome 8 137.3 1.76E-15 9.261 0.000 BRINP3 bone morphogenetic/retinoic acid inducible protein 3 135.8 0.00E+00 32.885 0.243 NKX2-2 NK2 homeobox 2 125.3 8.96E-15 0.457 0.000 IGF2BP1 insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 121.7 0.00E+00 8.783 0.071 GJA1 gap junction protein, alpha 1, 43kD gene name Fold change FDR-P, KO vs WT1 FPKM KO2 LINC01224 long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1224 1832.2 1.56E-149 0.000 10.839 ZNF483 zinc finger protein 483 1649.2 9.98E-143 0.000 2.201 OVOL1 ovo-like zinc finger 1 718.9 5.18E-50 0.000 1.434 FAM162B family with sequence. similarity 162, member B 323.3 3.96E-30 0.000 2.382 NAP1L2 nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 2 280.2 9.86E-180 0.018 5.828 ZNF544 zinc finger protein 544 264.4 1.02E-171 0.007 1.991 SLC1A1 solute carrier family 1 110.2 1.06E-11 0.000 0.211 TACC2 transforming, acidic coiled-coilcontaining protein 2 107.6 8.60E-11 0.000 159 THY1 Thy-1 cell surface antigen 39.8 0.000129366 0.000 0.050 ABCA8 ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), 8 37.8 0.002009234 0.000 0.025 CYP26B1 cytochrome P450, family 26B, polypeptide 1 37.4 0.000229216 0.000 0.055 ANXA3 annexin A3 35.3 0.002276797 0.000 orf204 chromosome 1 open reading frame 204 30.2 0.001942513 0.000 0.091 NDRG4 NDRG family member 4 30.1 0.00128289 0.000 0.023 NHS Nance-Horan syndrome 30.1 0.001597534 0.000 0.022 NIM1K NIM1K NIM1 serine/threonine protein kinase 29.3 6.57E-17 0.012 0.429 A4GALT alpha 1,4- qRT-PCR analysis was performed on selected RNAs from KBM-7 and NuKO cells in the presence and absence of 100 nM of the PARP inhibitor KU-0058948. qRT-PCR analysis was performed on selected RNAs from KBM-7 and NuKO cells in the presence and absence of 100 nM of the PARP inhibitor. down-regulated gene sets were signaling pathways related to immunity and inflammation. pathways associated with the innate immune response, such as activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and inflammation were specifically enriched in the down-regulated genes. functions associated with MHC class II antigens were specific for the set of up-regulated genes. interferon response and innate immunity Interferons are important mediators of the innate immune response. they provide an initial vital defence against invading pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) they can also inhibit cell proliferation, modulate the adaptive immune response, and be pro- or anti-inflammatory. STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 were all down-regulated (1.4-, 1.8- and 3.7-fold respectively) the pathway suppressors SOCS1 and PTPN2 were up-regulated (1.2\u20131.4-fold respectively) down-regulated genes are themselves activators of further IFN response genes. all three receptor genes are down-regulated (3.1-, 2.3- and 3.0-fold respectively) in nuKO cells. all four antiviral IFIT family members that bind viral components are down-regulated. other down-regulated anti-viral genes include PKR, GBP1 and TLR10 [55\u201358] p50 and p52 components of the NF-B complex and the RELB transactivator are all down-regulated as are many components of signaling pathways that lead to NF-B activation. IPA\u00ae identifies signaling in RA as a top-ranked affected canonical pathway. the extent to which these pathways can be regarded as up-regulated as a whole is open to question. a number of other genes involved in promotion of aspects of the adaptive immune response are up-regulated in nuKO cells. a number of genes involved in promotion of aspects of the adaptive immune response are up-regulated in nuKO cells. activation of mast cells by aggregation of FCR1 with IgE-antigen complexes has been reported to promote synthesis of Ap4A by lysyl-tRNA synthetase. together, these data suggest reinforcement of elements of the adaptive immune response by elevated Ap4A. there are some apparent exceptions, such as the down-regulation of the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2. expression of the rate-limiting IDO1 is induced in myeloid-lineage cells by IFNs, particularly Type II, and TNF can act synergistically to increase IDO1 expression [71] there is strong evidence that Trp catabolism and IDO1 expression in dendritic cells, which have a myeloid lineage, are important for the suppression of T-cell responses and the promotion of immune tolerance. IMPACT is up-regulated 13-fold in NuKO cells. this would contribute further to the promotion of T-cell responses if reproduced in T cells. IPA\u00ae classifies 1,108 of the 1,685 DEGs with 2-fold change. increased intracellular Ap4A seems to be associated overall with a strong anti-cancer effect. the well-characterized FHIT tumor suppressor protein that binds both Ap3A and Ap4A [8, 79] is not expressed in KBM-7 cells, probably as a result of gene deletion. GFRA1 encodes a receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) MT in hepatocellular carcinoma is down-regulated 590-fold in nuKO cells. mRNA binding protein IGF2BP1 promotes EMT while its knockdown reduces cell migration in various mesenchymal-like tumor cells. overexpression of NKD2 in metastatic osteosarcoma and breast carcinoma significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and decreases cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. it is up-regulated 16-fold in nuKO cells, while down-regulation has the opposite effect. overexpression of the coiled coil domain protein CCDC68 decreased proliferation and tumorigenicity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. allelic loss was found in about half the tumors examined. even genes with a more modest change in expression could have a profound anti-cancer effect. knockdown of its expression by only 50% is lethal to multiple myeloma cells. changes in expression of a small number of genes in nuKO cells could potentially promote cancer. reduced expression of early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) has been found in Hodgkin lymphoma. there is also evidence for a tumor suppressor role in mouse leukemia. 158-fold down-regulation of MGMT protein dealkylates toxic and mutagenic O6-alkylguanine lesions in DNA exposed to alkylating agents. MGMT status is an important determinant of the success of these therapies. IPA\u00ae prediction of upstream regulatory factors suggests numerous factors controlling large sets of down-regulated genes. of the top 100 most significant potential regulators, 97 are proposed to contribute to gene down-regulation. of the top 100 most significant potential regulators, 97 are proposed to contribute. the ubiquitin E3 ligase PDLIM2 (SLIM) is predicted by IPA\u00ae to both up-regulate and down-regulate different sets of genes. the prediction appears to be based on the results of one previous investigation into PDLIM2-modulated gene expression in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. the level of PDLIM2 expression in KBM-7 cells was not significantly affected by NUDT2 knockout (S2 Table), its activity may have been altered as a secondary effect of some other change e.g. to a protein kinase. there is no clear upstream pattern of regulation for the sets of up-regulated genes. STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 were all down-regulated (1.4-, 1.8- and 3.7-fold respectively) while the pathway suppressors SOCS1 and PTPN2 were up-regulated (1.2\u20131.4-fold respectively) down-regulated genes are themselves activators of further IFN response genes. all three receptor genes are down-regulated (3.1-, 2.3- and 3.0-fold respectively) in nuKO cells. all four antiviral IFIT family members that bind viral components are down-regulated. other down-regulated anti-viral genes include PKR, GBP1 and TLR10 [55\u201358] p50 and p52 components of the NF-B complex and the RELB transactivator are all down-regulated as are many components of signaling pathways that lead to NF-B activation. IPA\u00ae identifies signaling in RA as a top-ranked affected canonical pathway. the extent to which these pathways can be regarded as up-regulated as a whole is open to question. a number of other genes involved in promotion of aspects of the adaptive immune response are up-regulated in nuKO cells. a number of genes involved in promotion of aspects of the adaptive immune response are up-regulated in nuKO cells. activation of mast cells by aggregation of FCR1 with IgE-antigen complexes has been reported to promote synthesis of Ap4A by lysyl-tRNA synthetase. together, these data suggest reinforcement of elements of the adaptive immune response by elevated Ap4A. there are some apparent exceptions, such as down-regulation of the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2. expression of the rate-limiting IDO1 is induced in myeloid-lineage cells by IFNs, particularly Type II, and TNF can act synergistically to increase IDO1 expression. the observed down-regulation of these pathways in nuKO cells combined with the moderate up-regulation of the negative effectors DAP12 (TYROBP) and BIN1, a tumor suppressor, would be expected to reduce IDO1 expression substantially. expression of IMPACT is up-regulated 13-fold in nuKO cells. this would contribute further to the promotion of T-cell responses if reproduced in T cells. the level of NUDT2 expression positively correlates with lower survival. increased intracellular Ap4A seems to be associated overall with a strong anti-cancer effect. the well-characterized FHIT tumor suppressor protein that binds both Ap3A and Ap4A [8, 79] is not expressed in KBM-7 cells, probably as a result of gene deletion [38]. the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and their resistance to genotoxic treatment correlate directly with the level of GFRA1 expression. hepatocellular carcinoma is down-regulated 590-fold in nuKO cells. mRNA binding protein IGF2BP1 promotes EMT while its knockdown reduces cell migration in various mesenchymal-like tumor cells. phenotype in breast cancer cells is up-regulated 16-fold in nuKO cells. overexpression of NKD2 in metastatic osteosarcoma and breast carcinoma significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. overexpression of NKD2 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling. overexpression of the coiled coil domain protein CCDC68 decreased proliferation and tumorigenicity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. allelic loss was found in about half the tumors examined. even genes with a more modest change in expression could have a profound anti-cancer effect. decan-4 (SDC4) is down 51- and 35-fold in nuKO cells respectively. reduced expression of early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) has been found in Hodgkin lymphoma. there is also evidence for a tumor suppressor role in mouse leukemia. 158-fold down-regulation of MGMT protein dealkylates toxic and mutagenic O6-alkylguanine lesions in DNA exposed to alkylating agents. MGMT status is an important determinant of the success of these therapies. IPA\u00ae prediction of upstream regulatory factors suggests numerous factors controlling large sets of down-regulated genes. of the top 100 most significant potential regulators, 97 are proposed to contribute to gene down-regulation. of the top 100 most significant potential regulators, 97 are proposed to contribute. the ubiquitin E3 ligase PDLIM2 (SLIM) is predicted by IPA\u00ae to both up-regulate and down-regulate different sets of genes. the prediction appears to be based largely on the results of one previous investigation into PDLIM2-modulated gene expression in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. the level of PDLIM2 expression in KBM-7 cells was not significantly affected by NUDT2 knockout (S2 Table), its activity may have been altered as a secondary effect of some other change e.g. to a protein kinase. there is no clear upstream pattern of regulation for the sets of up-regulated genes. 113 genes shown to be up-regulated by MITF in melanoma. 23 were up- and 20 down-regulated in nuKO cells. cyclin D1 (CCND1), BCL2, BIRC5, MET, MYC, FRA1, TGFB, HIF1A, PAI-1 (SERPINE1) and AXIN2 were up-regulated. all known P2 receptor subtypes except P2X2, P2X3, P2X6, P2Y4, P2Y12 and P2Y13 were found to be expressed in KBM-7 cells with P2X1, P2X7 and P2Y8 showing slight but significant up-regulation. however, measurement of Ap4A in the cell-free growth medium showed that there was actually less in the medium taken from NuKO cells (0.11 0.01 pmol/106 cells, n = 3) than expression of a large number of histone gene variants is affected by NUDT2 disruption. changes in the expression of several lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs), histone deactylases (HDACs) and DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) could still be considered as a potential source of differential gene expression. RNA with a Kd of 2.4 M might be expected to affect 3\u2032-end processing and the half-lives of certain mRNAs [35, 149] of these 1450 transcripts, the steady-state levels of 928 were significantly increased and 28 were decreased. a comparison between the transcripts affected after NUDT21 knockdown in glioblastoma cells and those up- and down-regulated in NuKO cells revealed no overlap between the down-regulated genes. two related nudix family proteins, DCP2 (NUDT20) and NUDT16, have been shown to participate in mRNA decapping in vivo. a further six nudix proteins, including NUDT2, have varying degrees of decapping activity in vitro on both monomethylated and unmethylated capped RNAs. loss of NUDT2 could have consequences through the loss of interaction with any binding partner. we did attempt to answer this question directly by expression of the ApaH gene in nuKO cells. ApaH encodes a symmetrically-cleaving Ap4A hydrolase that it structurally unrelated to NUDT2. however, ApaH expression proved to be toxic to the cells. 113 genes shown to be up-regulated by MITF in melanoma [138], 23 were up- and 20 down-regulated in nuKO cells. other genes repressed by HINT1 through its interaction with MITF, USF2 or the WNT/catenin complex include cyclin D1 (CCND1), BIRC5, MET, MYC, FRA1, TGFB, HIF1A, PAI-1 (SERPINE1) and AXIN2 Ap4A could act through cell-surface purinoceptors to modulate known signaling pathways leading to changes in gene expression. all known P2 receptor subtypes except P2X2, P2X3, P2X6, P2Y4, P2Y12 and P2Y13 were found to be expressed in KBM-7 cells with P2X1, P2X7 and P2Y8 showing slight but significant up-regulation. expression of a large number of histone gene variants is affected by NUDT2 disruption. changes in the expression of several lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs), histone deactylases (HDACs) and DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) could still be considered as a potential source of differential gene expression. Knockdown of NUDT21 in glioblastoma cells results in shortened 3\u2032-UTRs in 1450 transcripts. of these 1450 transcripts, the steady-state levels of 928 were significantly increased and 28 were decreased. a comparison between the transcripts affected after NUDT21 knockdown in glioblastoma cells and those up- and down-regulated in NuKO cells revealed no overlap between the down-regulated genes. two related nudix family proteins, DCP2 (NUDT20) and NUDT16, have been shown to participate in mRNA decapping in vivo. a further six nudix proteins, including NUDT2, have varying degrees of decapping activity in vitro on both monomethylated and unmethylated capped RNAs. loss of NUDT2 could have consequences through the loss of interaction with any binding partner. ApaH encodes a symmetrically-cleaving Ap4A hydrolase that it structurally unrelated to NUDT2 [160] and in so doing we hoped to reduce Ap4A to normal levels in a NUDT2-negative background. despite being known since the 1960s, Ap4A has never commanded the attention that has been bestowed on other low-molecular-weight regulators such as cyclic nucleotides. nuKO phenotype may reflect the activation of feedback mechanisms. a viral-induced mediator of the interferon response, cyclic GAMP, can be transferred from cell to cell inside newly-formed virions. it is also interesting to speculate that viruses may also package Ap4A into new virions to counteract this. ppH (also known as YgdP or IalA) and the unrelated symmetrically-cleaving ApaH are required for optimal survival of bacteria during cellular invasion. they may help to prevent high host cell Ap4A induced by infection-associated stress from inhibiting essential bacterial functions. tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is the only one unable to synthesise Ap4A. there are currently no known specific small molecule inhibitors of NUDT2. such molecules have been described for the related nudix hydrolase MTH1 [174, 175], suggesting that specific inhibition of NUDT2 may be feasible. the extent to which changes in expression of other genes and pathways brought about by NUDT2 disruption might militate against its value as a target will only be determined by further investigation. list includes unannotated genes, pseudogenes and some non-protein coding genes. data include the observed overall direction of regulation [down (-) or up(+)], -log2(P-value), z-score and key molecules in each pathway. the activation z-score, where >2.0 or -2.0 is significantly predictive, the P-value and the molecules for which there is documented evidence for regulation."}
