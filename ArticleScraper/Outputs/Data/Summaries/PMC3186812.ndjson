{"summary": "sero-surveillance is needed to allow reliable real-time estimates of infection attack rate and severity. the ratio of IAR to pre-existing seroprevalence was a major determinant for the timeliness of reliable estimates. sero-surveillance substantially deteriorates if test specificity is not near 100%. o-surveillance with 300 specimens per week would yield reliable estimates when IAR reaches around 6%\u201310%. serologic data together with clinical surveillance data can allow reliable real-time estimates of IAR and severity in an emerging pandemic. the most recent influenza pandemic began in 2009 in Mexico. serologic data could provide real-time estimates of the infection attack rate (IAR) and the infection-hospitalization probability (IHP) during an influenza pandemic. serologic surveillance with 300 specimens per week would yield reliable estimates of IAR and IHP as soon as the true IAR reached about 6%. the level of testing capacity needed to provide real-time estimates of IAR and IHP during an emerging influenza pandemic should be logistically feasible. serologic monitoring should be included in future plans for influenza pandemic preparedness and response and in planning for other pandemics. initial estimates of a basic reproductive number in the range of 1.2\u20131.6 were consistent with findings in other countries that were subsequently affected [3]\u2013[5]. the initial estimate of case-fatality probability of 0.4% now appears substantially overestimated [6],[7]. method to our pdmH1N1 hospitalization and serologic data to compute real-time estimates of IHP and IAR. we then estimated the number of specimens that would have been required in order to obtain reliable estimates of IHP and IAR 3\u20134 wk before the epidemic peak. we assumed that IHP was constant from 30 June 2009 onwards. we tested 13,328 serum samples from blood donors (aged 16\u201359 y) and 3,613 from hospital outpatients (aged 5\u201390 y) serologic data between 30 June 2009 and 30 November 2009 were grouped into weekly batches. serologic data comprised 14,766 samples collected from 5\u201359 y olds before 30 November 2009. the same method has been used to estimate incidence of pdmH1N1 in England. if IHP is known, the true incidence curve is estimated by dividing a 0,...,at by IHP. this step can be skipped if the actual onset dates of hospitalized cases are known. sensitivity referred to the probability that the result of the serologic test was positive (negative) if the serum specimen was truly seropositive (seronegative), regardless of whether seropositivity was due to pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies or antibodies generated by recent pandemic infection. the cumulative distribution function of the time from illness onset to hospitalization F Hosp was based on those hospitalized cases whose onset dates were available in our clinical surveillance data. the proportion of infected individuals who eventually became seropositive and the cumulative distribution function of the time from illness onset to hospitalization F Hosp were estimated using published data on the kinetics of antibody response. time delay from illness onset to hospitalization, proportion of infected cases who reached seropositivity, and time delay from illness onset to hospitalization. e-flu database surveillance data showed 95% confidence intervals. posterior distributions were obtained using markov chain Monte Carlo method. reliable estimates of IHP for pdmH1N1 by mid-August 2009. simulated 300 stochastic realizations of serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance. simulated 300 serum samples per week starting 28 d after 50 infections were seeded in a population of 1 million. sero-surveillance performed 28 d after sero-surveillance. sero-surveillance began 28 d after sero-surveillance. sero-surveillance began 28 d after. seeding, with 150, 300, and 450 specimens per week; (2) sero-surveillance begun 14, 28, and 42 d after seeding, with 300 specimens per week. ethics committee approves all study protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong cluster. pdmH1N1 seropositivity is an MN antibody titer of 140 and pdmH1N1 seroprevalence as the proportion of individuals who were seropositive. the age-specific seroprevalence of the three groups of participants was largely similar across time during the first wave (Figure S1). serologic data between 30 June 2009 and 30 November 2009 were collectively used to estimate the seroprevalence on 30 June 2009. serologic data comprised 14,766 samples collected from 5\u201359 y olds before 30 November 2009. the same method has been used to estimate incidence of pdmH1N1 in England [9],[10]. sensitivity and specificity of serologic testing were assumed to be 100%. the method can be extended to incorporate imperfect sensitivity and specificity, temporal variation in IHP and different titer cutoffs. pdmH1N1 IHP and IAR were estimated for the following age groups for ease of comparison with previous study. ti in the likelihood function of Step 3 in the basic algorithm was defined to be the average collection time of the specimens contained in the ith batch. to simplify our analysis, we assumed that F Seropos was an Erlang-10 distribution with mean Seropos. we constructed a likelihood L A(, Seropos) for these antibody response data. resulting MLEs were = 1 and Seropos = 9.6 d. erior distributions were obtained using markov chain Monte Carlo method. the posterior distribution of the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases who eventually developed MN titer 140. in this model, our IAR estimate would be accurate if and only if our IHP estimate was accurate. simulated serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 serum samples per week starting 28 d after 50 infections were seeded in a population of 1 million. the 28 d delay after seeding was meant to reflect the time needed to develop a reliable serologic assay and to set up the sero-surveillance operations. sero-surveillance began 28 d after seeding, with 150, 300, and 450 specimens per week. sero-surveillance began 14, 28, and 42 d after seeding, with 300 specimens per week. simulated serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance in 100 epidemic scenarios. seroprevalence in the full model was substantially higher than proportion of seropositive sera in the data. the largest discrepancy was that the final IAR for 15\u201319 y olds in the full model was 9% higher than our previous estimate. each batch of serologic data was assumed to be available 3 d after the last sample of that batch was collected. comparison of the estimates of IHP and IAR in the full model with those from our previous study. for the 5\u201314 y olds, reliable estimate of IHP would not have been available until the first wave was almost over. the final IAR was comparable in magnitude to the pre-existing seroprevalence for this age group. for the 30\u201359 y olds, reliable estimate of IHP would not have been available until mid- to late September 2009. serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 specimens per week yielded reliable estimates of IHP when the true seroprevalence was around 1%. 100% of infected cases became seropositive 9.6 d after illness onset on average (Figure 2B and 2C), IAR was around 6% when seroprevalence was around 1%. seropositivity cutoff set to MN titer 140 and 180, pre-existing seroprevalence in our serosurvey was 3%\u20135% and 0.2%, respectively. increasing the cutoff for seropositivity at the expense of decreasing the proportion of infected cases seropositive (the mean of F Seropos) by 50% from 9.6 d to 14.5 d would only slightly delay the timeliness of accurate estimates of IHP. serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 serum specimens per week provided accurate estimates of IHP when IAR reached around 6%. if the epidemic doubling time was longer than 6 d, it would be impossible for serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance to yield accurate estimates of IHP during the nascent stage of the epidemic. seroprevalence, IHP, and final IAR in the full model provided a reasonably good fit to the serial cross-sectional serologic data except for the first 2 wk of September for 5\u201314 y olds. the largest discrepancy was that the final IAR for 15\u201319 y olds in the full model was 9% higher than our previous estimate. the third and fourth rows show the sequential real-time estimates of IHP and IAR. estimates were sequentially updated upon each new cross-section of serologic data. each batch of serologic data was assumed to be available 3 d after the last sample of that batch was collected. reliable estimates of IHP would have been available in early October 2009 for 5\u201314 y olds, early September 2009 for 15\u201329 y olds, and mid-October 2009 for 30\u201359 y olds. these time points corresponded to 1 wk after, 1\u20132 wk before, and 3 wk after the epidemic peak for this age group. for the 30\u201359 y olds, reliable estimate of IHP would not have been available until the first wave was almost over because serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 specimens per week yielded reliable estimates of IHP when the true seroprevalence was around 1%. 100% of infected cases became seropositive 9.6 d after illness onset on average (Figure 2B and 2C), IAR was around 6% when seroprevalence was around 1%. serologic follow-up of 881 and 79 virologically confirmed pdmH1N1 cases found that around 57% and 94% of cases developed MN titer 180 [14],[21] with the cutoff set to MN titer 140 and 180, the pre-existing seroprevalence in our serosurvey was 3%\u20135% and 0.2%, respectively. increasing the cutoff for seropositivity at the expense of decreasing the proportion of in serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 serum specimens per week provided accurate estimates of IHP when IAR reached around 6%. if the epidemic doubling time was longer than 6 d, serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 specimens per week provided accurate estimates of IHP when IAR reached around 6%. reliable estimates of IAR and IHP could have been obtained 1 wk after, 1\u20132 wk before, and 3 wk after the epidemic peak for 5\u201314 y olds, 15\u201329 y olds, and 30\u201359 y olds. the 2009 pandemic provided a particular challenge from the point of view of serologic interpretation. serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance may be enhanced if exact titers were available and incorporated into the real-time estimation of IHP. the 2009 influenza pandemic highlighted the need for improved methods of rapid, reliable assessment of severity for an unfolding infectious disease outbreak. sero-surveillance study would draw from random sample of population of interest. paired serologic data also gave similar seroprevalence estimates. sero-surveillance does require substantial laboratory infrastructure and resources. togo et al. [31] analyzed sera from seven individuals who were experimentally challenged with the A2/Hong Kong strain. 0%, 57%, and 100% had neutralization titer 132 1, 2, and 3 wk after exposure. serologic follow-up of around 100 cases for 28 d would be sufficient for supporting sero-surveillance. serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with about 300 specimens per week would allow reliable estimates of IHP and IAR as soon as IAR reached around 6%. serologic surveillance should be considered in updated plans for influenza pandemic prepared. figure S1 Age-specific proportions of individuals with antibody titers 140 by viral MN in Hong Kong since June 2009. data points with sample size 10 are not shown. figure S2 The number of serum specimens that would have been needed to yield reliable estimates of IHP by mid-August during the 2009 influenza pandemic."}
