{"summary": "infection can extend to lower respiratory tract in children4,5,6 or immunocompromised hosts7,8, but is generally not concerned as singular cause of severe pneumonia. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have enhanced the detection of respiratory viral infection. but severe rhinovirus pneumonia resulting respiratory failure in an immunocompetent host is still considered extremely unusual. hemoglobin concentration 12.7 g/dL, platelet count 366,000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 84 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein level 43.1 mg/dL. the patient's liver and renal function tests were within normal range. bronchoscopy was performed immediately. X-ray began to improve after five days, and the patient was discharged from hospital after three weeks. initial chest X-ray. (B) after 1 week. Figure 2. Chest computed tomography findings of initial lung infiltration. severe rhinovirus pneumonia may actually occur in an immunocompetent host. chronic alcoholic ingestion could be a major immune modulator for respiratory viral infection. viral etiology should be considered in cases of severe pneumonia."}
