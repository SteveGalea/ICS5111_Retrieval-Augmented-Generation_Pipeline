{"summary": "coronaviruses are associated with respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity. coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination (2,4) as a result of the unique mechanism of viral replication, coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination. coronavirus genes and genome sequences are annotated by orf1ab. the annotations are often confusing because they are not annotated. in all databases, for the non-structural proteins encoded by ORFs downstream to orf1ab, the annotations are often confusing because they are not annotated. CoVDB contains 3982 coronavirus sequences and one torovirus genome sequence. by July 2007, CoVDB contains 12 344 genes and UTRs. all data were retrieved from GenBank using modules of bioperl. Default is to show the \u2018Type strain\u2019 for each species only. for genes downstream to orf1ab, sequences upstream to the initiation codons can also be retrieved from this result page. gene sequences are grouped vertically according to which coronavirus group and subgroup they belong to. the numbers next to each checkbox indicates the number of that gene in CoVDB. the option \u2018Exclude partial CDS\u2019 can be used if only complete genes are required. all non-structural proteins in the polyprotein encoded by orf1ab are named as \u2018nsp\u2019. the structural proteins after the polyprotein are hemagglutinin esterase (HE, in group 2a coronaviruses), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) NS4x denotes the ORFs between S and E of group 2a coronaviruses. one exception is NS5a of group 2a coronaviruses. NS7x denotes the ORFs downstream of N gene. n-3\u2032UTR 2c 5\u2032UTR-nsp1-16-S-NS3x-E-M-N-3\u2032UTR 2d 5\u2032UTR-nsp1-16-S-NS3x-E-M-N-(NS7x)-3\u2032UTR 3 5\u2032UTR-nsp1-16-S-NS3x-E-M-N-(NS7x)-3\u2032UTR Identical sequence labeling Sequence redundancy is the blast search page is an interface for facilitating coronavirus similarity search. the background support program, blastall, is from the NCBI Blast package. users can choose one of the three nucleotide and two protein sequence datasets as the database for comparison. Sequence data CoVDB is a web-based coronavirus database. By July 2007, CoVDB contains 3982 coronavirus sequences and one torovirus genome sequence. by July 2007, CoVDB contains 12 344 genes and UTRs. CoVDB contains 12 344 genes and UTRs. data on coronavirus genome characteristics can be accessed by clicking \u2018Genome\u2019 in the top menu bar of CoVDB. specific gene can be retrieved using the pull-down list at the left lower corner. the number in brackets indicates the number of complete genomes for that coronavirus. Default is to show the \u2018Type strain\u2019 for each species only. 'uniq' will be shown if there is no other identical sequence in CoVDB. otherwise, gene id of the sequences identical to it will be shown. polyprotein annotation In all coronavirus genomes, orf1ab occupies two-thirds of the genome. the structural proteins after the polyprotein are hemagglutinin esterase (HE), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) there is no unified naming system for the non-structural proteins encoded by ORFs downstream to orf1ab. this lack of a unified system greatly reduces the stability and accuracy of ortholog retrieval. NS4x denotes the ORFs between S and E of group 2a coronaviruses. one exception is NS5a of group 2a coronaviruses. NS7x denotes the ORFs downstream of N gene. 'UTR-nsp1-16-S-NS3x-E-M-NS5x-N-(NS7x)-3\u2032UTR Identical sequence labeling Sequence redundancy is another problem of coronavirus sequences in public nucleotide databases. users can choose to show or not to show strains with identical sequences by clicking on the check boxes to the left of the page. users can choose one of the three nucleotide and two protein sequence datasets as the database for comparison. the three nucleotide datasets are: coV genes (nsp + genes after 1ab), coV genes (1ab + genes after 1ab) and CoV GenBank strains, which are the original sequences retrieved from GenBank. CoVDB contains two main pages for sequence retrieval. from the homepage, one can enter the first main page for retrieval of complete genomes and their genes by clicking \u2018CoVDB\u2019. the option \u2018Exclude partial CDS\u2019 can be used if only complete genes are required. an example of retrieving all the sequence of a particular gene for a group of coronavirus is shown in Figure 3b. non-structural proteins are essential for replication or virulence of the coronavirus. PLpro and 3CLpro of coronavirus cleave at conserved specific amino acids. cleavage sites of the 15\u201316 non-structural proteins can be predicted by multiple sequence alignment. NS2a denotes the ORF between orf1ab and HE of group 2a coronaviruses. NS3a denotes the ORFs between S and E of groups 1, 2c, 2d and 3 coronaviruses. in most of these coronaviruses, there are two NS3x, named NS3a and NS3b. DB contains a link to a Gene synonyms page. it includes a list of synonymous names of the various genes in the coronavirus genomes. users can choose to show or not to show strains with identical sequences. the results will only show that the hits are within orf1ab, or in some cases, shown to be within the entire coronavirus genome. this problem has been overcome by the annotated sequences in CoVDB. the background support program, blastall, is from the NCBI Blast package. one or more query sequences can be pasted into the second sequence input box for blastn or blastp search against the temporary sequence database. the results page shows the positions and lengths of each putative ORF and the position of the putative ribosomal frameshift site for translation of orf1ab.
