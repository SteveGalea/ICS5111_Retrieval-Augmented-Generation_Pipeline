{"summary": "clays are a primary nonorganic component of soils and aquatic sediments. the dynamic interactions between clay minerals and phage are expected to affect soil\u2013bacteria activity. morphology plays a role in the interactions between viruses and clays. many studies have focused on clay influence on virus survivability. many studies have focused on clay influence on virus survivability. but only several have investigated factors that can affect virus\u2013clay interaction. coliphage T1 and reovirus type 3 adsorb onto different sites on kaolinite and kaolinite. this indicates that reovirus adsorbs onto negatively charged regions of the clays. this indicates that reovirus adsorbs onto negatively charged regions. reovirus adsorption occurs at negatively charged sites on cation exchanged clay. but Lipson and Stotzky (1983) found that reovirus adsorption occurs at negatively charged sites on cation exchanged kaolinite and MMT. the aim is to provide insight into the methods of viral inactivation. the clay was washed in 5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to remove organic contaminants and then washed multiple times in distilled water. the supernatant comprising the fraction with an equivalent spherical Stokes diameter less than 0.2 m was collected for use in this experiment. plate lysates of 6 were prepared by plating phage dilutions into soft agar with a culture of LM2333. cell debris and agar were removed by centrifugation in a rotor. bacteriophage samples were then layered on a 10\u201330% sucrose gradient in buffer A. Turbidity measurements of 6 following the procedure described by Oster (1951) demonstrated that 6 surface charge is negative at pH 7 (spectra not shown). Purification of NC The purified 6 virus was isolated by removing the 6 envelope with Triton X-100 as described by steely and Lang (1984). the purified 6 virus was mixed with 10% Triton X-100 solution in buffer ACN. endorf tubes were incubated at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for an hour. the mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 3600 rpm (1200g) the pelleted aggregates were vortexed prior to plaquing to disaggregate the mixture. the pelleted aggregates were spot checked on plates with growing P. syringae. 6 virions have a clearly defined envelope that appears as a lower density region under negative staining. the NC outer icosahedral shell also appears as a brighter region in the micrographs. a population of virions attached to platelet surface is labeled A. arrows indicate distorted or partially disassembled virions. solid arrows point to virions that have undergone total envelope removal leaving only the NCs. purification of 6 6 is the first isolated member of the Cystoviridae family. the 6 virion has a layered structure consisting of an inner NC surrounded by the lipid envelope. fugation was at 23,000 rpm (6.7 104g) for 1 h at 15\u00b0C using a Beckman SW 40 Ti rotor. after which the phage band was visualized by light scattering. the next day the phage band was again visualized by light scattering. the phage sample was then centrifuged with a Sorvall T-1270 rotor. Montmorillonite\u2013virus mixtures were mixed in ACN buffer with 100 L 6 bacteriophage. cations were sufficient to initiate fast aggregation of MMT. the mixture aggregated in less than a few minutes. TEM grids were prepared using 6 concentrations of 1011 virions mL1 and MMT concentration of 1.7 mg mL1. electron micrographs were acquired with either a Jeol 2100 or a Tecnai FEI 20 (FEI, Hillsborough, OR) electron microscope. between 55 and 63 nm diameters were classified as nondistorted MMT-NCs. virions deviating from circularity were classified as complete but distorted 6 if the larger diameter was greater than 68 nm, or distorted MMT-NCs if the larger diameter was less than 63 nm. the vast majority of the virions in Figure 1A exhibit aspect ratios near unity (1.08 0.07). only two NC particles with diameters of 69 2 nm are present in the field of view. TEM of 6\u2013montmorillonite aggregates: a majority of the virions are sandwiched between platelets and partially obscured due to masking by thin MMT sheets. a noticeable fraction of the 6 are attached to the edges of the platelets. distorted 57 nm MMT-NCs appear embedded in clay at position labeled A. distorted virions indicate that either the envelope disassembly increases particle size as water infiltrates the lipid\u2013protein membrane or compression of virions has caused distortion. the magnified inset depicts the repeating tetrahedral\u2013octahedral MMT layering. virions are shown to preferentially aggregate along the positive edges and wedged between vertically oriented platelets. the boundary layer that includes the envelope between MMT-NC and the outer surface of the virion is of variable thickness, as much as 17 nm, compared to the 6 nm envelope thickness reported by Kenney et al. (1992) the envelope of virion #2 at the platelet edge also appeared to have undergone disassembly. the interaction with the clay is likely weaker than that between the MMT and the partially disassembled virions. the majority of NC particles in the aggregate exhibit little or no distortion and remain spherical with a diameter of 57 nm. lane 4 is from the extracted pellet and lane 6 is from the supernatant of a mixture of MMT and detergent-isolated NC. lane 6 is from the supernatant of a mixture of MMT and detergent-isolated NC, also at an NC concentration equal to that used in lane 4. at virus concentrations exceeding the number of platelets, infectivity is reduced by a factor of 101.5\u2013105. the least amount of loss of infectivity corresponded to smaller amounts of clay and the larger degree of loss corresponded to larger amounts of clay. the variation in infectivity loss may be due to aggregation dynamics affecting the probability of virion\u2013clay contact. virions with diameter 69 2 nm for over 95% of the particles are present in the field of view. only two NC particles with diameters of 57 nm (labeled NC) are present in the field of view. TEM of 6\u2013montmorillonite aggregates An important characteristic of the micrographs is the complete absence of either free virions or virion-only aggregates at sufficient MMT concentrations to produce visible aggregates ( 1 mg mL1). a majority of the virions are sandwiched between platelets and partially obscured due to masking by thin MMT sheets. the particles near the platelet edge are distinctly smaller than triton-isolated NCs. the distorted 57 nm MMT-NC distortion increases the contact area between the particle and the positively charged MMT edge. the outer surface of the protein shell acquired a negative charge during disassembly. the magnified inset depicts the repeating tetrahedral\u2013octahedral layering. virions are shown to preferentially aggregate along the positive edges and wedged between vertically oriented platelets. the boundary layer between the envelope and the outer surface of the virion is of variable thickness, as much as 17 nm, compared to the 6 nm envelope thickness reported by Kenney et al. (1992), suggesting water is infiltrating the virion. the envelope of virion #2 at the platelet edge also appeared to have undergone disassembly. the interaction with the clay is likely weaker than that between the MMT and the partially disassembled virions. the majority of NC particles in the aggregate exhibit little or no distortion and remain spherical with a diameter of 57 nm. lane 4 is from the extracted pellet and lane 6 is from the supernatant of a mixture of MMT and detergent-isolated NC, also at an NC concentration equal to that used in lane 4. the absence of P3 in the NC lanes shows that the NC preparation did not contain whole virus. at virus concentrations exceeding the number of platelets, infectivity is reduced by a factor of 101.5\u2013105. the least amount of loss of infectivity corresponded to smaller amounts of clay and the larger degree of loss corresponded to larger amounts of clay. the variation in infectivity loss may be due to aggregation dynamics affecting the probability of virion\u2013clay contact. the edge-bound 6 virions are likely held preferentially by van der Waals forces to the negatively charged platelet faces. both binding mechanisms contribute to the disassembly and swelling of virions and indicate that the envelope is pliable."}
