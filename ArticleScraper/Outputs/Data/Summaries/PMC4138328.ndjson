{"summary": "kissing-loop interactions are widespread elements of RNA tertiary structures. they are central to many RNA-mediated processes, such as antisense recognition, plasmid replication control, retroviral dimerization, translation initiation, and ribosomal frameshifting. one of the best-studied interactions occurs during retroviral genome dimerization in HIV-1. ving VS ribozyme revealed that the catalytic domain recognizes its substrate (stem\u2013loop I) through a kissing-loop interaction that is stabilized by magnesium ions. this interaction involves three Watson\u2013Crick base pairs between residues 630, 631, and 632 of stem\u2013loop I (SLI) and residues 697, 698, and 699 of stem\u2013loop V (SLV) the I/V kissing-loop interaction is important for several steps of the VS ribozyme cleavage reaction. the interaction involves W-C base pairs (black lines) between shaded residues of SLI and SLV. the cleavage site is between residues 1 and +1 of SLIsb. ical base pairs are represented by solid and dashed lines. stable base stacking at the kissing-loop junction is illustrated by gray rectangles. u13 is in gray to illustrate its extrusion from loop V fold. LV loops adopt U-turn structures, which facilitate formation of three expected W-C base pairs between SLI and SLV. additional hydrogen bonding and base stacking interactions at the kissing-loop junction are needed to evaluate the affinity of the SLI/SLV interaction in light of the NMR structure. RESULTS Thermodynamic characterization of the VS ribozyme I/V kissing-loop interaction using two isolated stem\u2013loops derived from the VS ribozyme. the initial SLI substrate was designed to adopt only an active preshifted conformation. ITC experiments were first carried out at 25\u00b0C in a buffer containing 20 mM MgCl2. analysis of duplicate ITC experiments for formation of this 1:1 SLIps/SLV complex yields the following average thermodynamic values. the raw data of a representative titration experiment are shown on the left top panel. on the left bottom panel, two isothermal curves of the titration experiment are shown. in the titration experiment, 100 M of wild-type SLV was used in the syringe and 10 M of SLIps was used in the cell. ln(KA) on ln[MgCl2 for the SLIps/SLV complex is best fit by a second-order polynomial equation: y = 0.1651x2 0.8162x + 14.748. error bars were calculated for each point from the standard deviations of two experiments. VS ribozyme variants were kinetically characterized to evaluate the contribution of U700 and other SLV loop residues to SLI recognition. this study revealed that replacing U700 by A, C, or G does not significantly affect the ribozyme cleavage activity, whereas U700 deletion dramatically impairs this activity. in contrast, an SLV variant containing a U700 deletion (U700) displays a substantial decrease in affinity for SLIps with a KD value of 50 M. a KD > 200 M was estimated, assuming that the poor quality of the titration curve reflects a situation in which c 1 [c = (concentration of RNA in the cell)/KD]. the GITC value of this variant (3.2 kcal/mol) indicates that the deletion of U700 results in an energetic cost of 3 kcal/mol for SLI binding. the GITC value of this variant (3.2 kcal/mol) indicates that the deletion of U700 results in an energetic cost of 3 kcal/mol for SLI binding. cytosines C635 to C637 in helix Ib shift their position in the stem, excluding C634 (C14) from the helix and rearranging the cleavage site internal loop. we selected shiftable variants that convert from an inactive to an active conformation upon SLV binding in the presence of Mg2+ ions. the ITC results reveal higher affinities (lower KD) of SLV for preshifted SLI variants compared to shiftable SLI variants (SLIps versus SLIsb and SLIpsIa versus SLIsbIa) a lower affinity for SLV is observed in the presence of stem Ia (SLIsb) than in its absence (SLIsbIa) the stability of complexes formed with several nonshiftable SLI variants (SLIps, SLIpsIa, SLIds1, SLIds2) is influenced neither by the sequence nor the structure of the helical domain adjoining the terminal loop. the VS ribozyme I/V kissing-loop interaction is more stable than predicted. pairs at the I/V kissing-loop junction form a short A-form helix. the predicted G (Gpre) for the short RNA duplex is 0.5 kcal/mol. the NMR structure of the SLIds2/SLV complex also reveals 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-stacking interactions. kissing-loop complexes have been thoroughly investigated both structurally and thermodynamically. we examined their stability by comparing their experimental G values obtained from previous studies (Gexp) with their G value predicted according to nearest-neighbor calculations (Gpre) the values of gexp and Gpre obtained for the other kissing-loop interactions investigated are similar. similar complexes were used in previous thermodynamic studies of the TAR/TAR* complex. MMLV H3-18 and I/V kissing-loop interactions are substantially more stable than predicted from thermodynamic calculations. both the MMLV H3-18 and I/V kissing-loop interactions are substantially more stable than predicted from thermodynamic calculations. the KD values associated with SLV binding to the noncleavable SLI analogs are within threefold of those obtained for binding to the corresponding unmodified SLI variants. the titrant is an SLI derivative for Table 3, but SLV for Table 4). odynamic characterization of the VS ribozyme I/V kissing-loop interaction by ITC using two isolated stem\u2013loops derived from the VS ribozyme. we determined the thermodynamic parameters associated with the I/V kissing-loop interaction by ITC using isolated RNA stem\u2013loops. an isolated SLV receptor hairpin is sufficient to bind an isolated SLI substrate. /SLV complex yields the following average thermodynamic values: KD = 0.24 0.01 M; H = 22.0 0.1 kcal/mol; TS= 12.9 0.1 kcal/mol; and GITC= 9.04 0.03 kcal/mol (Table 1). primary and secondary structures of SLI and SLV RNAs used in this study. 100 M of wild-type SLV was used in the syringe and 10 M of SLIps was used in the cell. ITC experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C under varying concentrations of MgCl2. g2+ dependence of SLIps/SLV binding can also be analyzed as where 2+ is the apparent interaction coefficient that represents the net uptake or release of divalent cations associated with the interaction. the plot of ln(KA) versus ln[Mg2+] is generally linear within a certain range of Mg2+ concentration, but it is not expected over the full range of Mg2+ concentration. VS ribozyme variants were kinetically characterized to evaluate the contribution of U700 and other SLV loop residues to SLI recognition. this study revealed that replacing U700 by A, C, or G does not significantly affect the ribozyme cleavage activity, whereas U700 deletion dramatically impairs this activity. for the C699G variant, thermodynamic parameters could not be derived even at high concentrations of RNA (1 mM C699G SLV in the syringe and 100 M of SLIps in the cell) a KD > 200 M was estimated, assuming that the poor quality of the titration curve reflects a situation in which c 1 [c = (concentration of RNA in the cell)/KD] the small ratios (4) indicate that neither the affinity of the I/V kissing-loop interaction nor ribozyme activity is significantly affected by these modifications. the GITC (0.7 kcal/mol) indicates that no substantial loss of free energy of binding resulted from these modifications. we also selected preshifted variants that adopt a single active shifted conformation in their free form. similar shiftable and preshifted variants that lack stem Ia (Ia) were also investigated to evaluate the energetic cost of stem Ia in the formation of the SLI/SLV complex. a lower affinity for SLV is observed in the presence of stem Ia (SLIsb) than in its absence (SLIsbIa) the presence of stem Ia does not significantly decrease the affinity of SLV to a preshifted SLI variant (SLIps versus SLIpsIa) ribozyme I/V kissing-loop interaction is more stable than predicted. we obtained KD values ranging from 0.24 to 0.71 M for binding of nonshiftable SLI variants to SLV. the observed KD values reflect the thermodynamic stability of the I/V kissing-loop interaction. the SLIds2/SLV complex also reveals 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-stacking interactions, which contribute to helix stability. they include a 5\u2032-stacking interaction between C629 and G630 in SLI and between C699 and A701 in SLV. a Gpre value of 4.2 kcal/mol is obtained for the resulting duplex. high-salt conditions, either at 1 M NaCl or high Mg2+ concentrations (5\u201310 mM MgCl2) are comparable to those used for establishing nearest-neighbor calculations. the experimental G values (Gexp) and the Gpre can differ considerably (0.3\u20134.1 kcal/mol) when only base-pair stacking interactions are taken into account for calculation of the Gpre value. the MMLV H3-18 kissing-loop complex used here and in previous UV melting studies (Kim and Tinoco 2000). in A\u2013D, interactions at the kissing-loop junction are highlighted by pale gray shading for W-C base pair and dark gray boxes for base stacking. TC conditions yielded a GITC of 5.0 kcal/mol (Table 4), which indicates a weaker interaction than previously established under lower salt conditions. both the MMLV H3-18 and I/V kissing-loop interactions are substantially more stable than predicted from thermodynamic calculations. both the MMLV H3-18 and I/V kissing-loop interactions are substantially more stable than predicted from thermodynamic calculations. KD values for binding of noncleavable SLI analogs to the VS Rz are within 1.5-fold of those obtained for binding of the same SLI analogs to the free SLV. binding of these SLI variants to either SLV or VS Rz involves similar free energies. methyl modification used for our studies prevents interaction(s) with the 2\u2032-OH at the cleavage site. the high stability of the kissing-loop complex cannot be predicted from thermodynamic calculations even when both base-pair stacking and 5\u2032/3\u2032 stacking interactions are considered in estimating Gpre. this is not a result of exceptional experimental conditions. similar thermodynamic calculations were not successful in predicting the high stability of the MMLV H3-18 complex. the MMLV H3-18 complex and the VS ribozyme I/V kissing-loop complex may not be justly accounted for by the thermodynamic model. both base triples are part of an intricate structure that extends from the kissing-loop junction toward the stems of SLI and SLV to create a continuously stacked structure. a net uptake of 1 Mg2+ ion is associated with formation of the SLI/SLV complex. formation of kissing-loop complexes derived from the HIV-1 TAR-TAR*, the HIV-1 DIS, and the ColE1 RNAI-RNAII interactions also involves net uptakes of 1\u20132 Mg2+. phosphate clusters are found at the kissing-loop junction of these complexes. a KA of 3.6 105 M1 and H of 25 kcal/mol was measured at 25\u00b0C. a KA of 3.6 105 M1 and H of 25 kcal/mol was measured at 25\u00b0C and 10 kcal/mol. mM MgSO4 (Gexp at 37\u00b0C of 6.88 kcal/mol) is more stable by 7.7 kcal/mol than predicted for the corresponding RNA duplex. this value is very similar to that of 7.2\u20138.0 kcal/mol obtained for the SLI/SLV complexes. the role of U700 in the I/V kissing-loop interaction is confined to the I/V kissing-loop interaction. the ribose phosphate of the extruded U700 residue contributes to the stability of the I/V kissing-loop interaction. a comparison between the thermodynamic parameters of the wild-type SLV and the U700 variant indicates that the free energy loss of 3 kcal/mol is due to both unfavorable entropic (1.3 kcal/mol) and enthalpic changes (1.9 kcal/mol) as previously suggested, U700 could provide an entropic advantage for substrate recognition by increasing the loop dynamics. such loop dynamics may contribute the necessary plasticity within the SLV loop structure to optimize the intermolecular contacts ion binding sites have not been mapped within the SLI/SLV complex. the ribose-phosphate of U700 contributes in several different ways to the stability of the complex. the complex is highly stable when formed with preshifted substrates, but less so when formed with shiftable substrates. these VS ribozyme/SLI complexes were artificially stabilized by an intermolecular helix. this confirms that only SLV and not other parts of the VS ribozyme contribute to shifting the SLI helix upon SLI binding. formation of the SLI/SLV complex with a preshifted SLI substrate containing stem Ia (SLIps) is more energetically favorable by 3 kcal/mol than with a shiftable SLI substrate containing stem Ia. stem Ia clearly contributes to stabilizing the unshifted inactive conformation and can affect cleavage rates of VS ribozymes. formation of the SLI/SLV complex with several SLI variants is remarkably high, more stable by 7\u20138 kcal/mol than predicted for a comparable RNA duplex with three Watson\u2013Crick base pairs. formation of the SLI/SLV complex with several SLI variants is remarkably high, more stable by 7\u20138 kcal/mol than predicted for a comparable RNA duplex with three Watson\u2013Crick base pairs. plex stability can be useful for estimating the stability of these kissing-loop complexes containing 6\u20137 W-C base pairs when both base-pair stacking and 5\u2032/3\u2032 stacking interactions are taken into account. similar thermodynamic calculations were not successful in predicting the high stability of the MMLV H3-18 complex. the KD of the SLIps/SLV interaction could not be measured by ITC at MgCl2 concentrations below 0.5 mM. starting at 0.5 mM MgCl2, we observed a decrease in KD with increasing Mg2+ ion concentration. several phosphate clusters are found at the kissing-loop junction. formation of the free SLI and SLV loop leads to a more compact and compact SLI loop, but creates only minor changes in the SLV loop structure. a net increase in electronegative charge density upon formation is due to both SLI folding into a more compact loop structure. it has been known for some time that trinucleotides bind more tightly to a complementary tRNA anticodon than would be expected for complementary RNA oligonucleotides. in pioneering binding experiments with a kissing-loop complex formed between the complementary anticodons of yeast tRNAPhe and Escherichia coli tRNAGlu, a KA of 3.6 105 M1 and H of 25 kcal/mol were measured at 25 such stacking is present in free SLV, but not in free SLI. the U-turn structure may promote kissing-loop formation by retracting the phosphate backbone away from the interface, thereby reducing electrostatic repulsion. I/V kissing-loop interaction using isolated stem\u2013loops demonstrate that a U700C modification does not significantly affect the affinity of the SLI/SLV interaction. a deletion of U700 significantly reduces the affinity of this interaction. the role of U700 is confined to the I/V kissing-loop interaction and likely not other aspects of the cleavage reaction. this interaction with the phosphate of U700 likely stabilizes the A14V-U8V-C10I base triple at the kissing-loop junction. the ribose-phosphate of U700 could also contribute to the enthalpic stability of the SLI/SLV complex through its interaction with a Mg2+ ion. two VS ribozyme/SLI complexes were formed using open-loop SLI RNAs. these complexes are devoid of stem Ia and contain a G627A mutation in the loop. these results are consistent with chemical modification and mutation. helix Ia is an inhibitory element of shiftable substrates for catalysis of self-cleaving ribozymes. mutations that disrupt stem Ia also increase the size of the linker between SLI and the rest of the ribozyme. formation of the SLI/SLV complex with a preshifted SLI substrate containing stem Ia is more energetically favorable by 3 kcal/mol than with a shiftable SLI substrate containing stem Ia. for cleavage to occur, the SLI internal loop must dock with the catalytic domain to form the active site. the interaction is thermodynamically dominant for substrate recognition by the VS ribozyme. the remarkable stability of this interaction is modulated by Mg2+ concentration. the ribozyme was synthesized from plasmid pAvaplVS derived from plasmid pAvapl (Lacroix-Labont\u00e9 et al. 2012) to allow synthesis of the ribozyme with its substrate at the 3\u2032 end. the transcription reaction was performed in vitro at 37\u00b0C using the pAvaplVS plasmid linearized with EcoRI, the T7 RNA polymerase, unlab RNA concentrations were estimated from UV absorbance at 260 nm (A260) using extinction coefficients (260) determined by taking the sum of 260 values for each nucleotide. all solutions used with the VP-ITC were degassed for 10\u201315 min at 22\u00b0C before each experiment. s1 RNAs), 200 M (SLIsbIa, SLIps, SLIsb, and SLIds2 RNAs) and the concentration of SLV in the cell was 10 times lower than that of the titrants. the concentration of VS Rz in the syringe was 100 M, and the concentration of noncleavable SLI (SLIsbIa-1m and SLIps-1m) in the cell was 10 M control experiment was subtracted from the titration experiment to eliminate the effect of diluting the titrant. data collected for each titration experiment were then fit to a single binding site model or to a dimer-monomer dissociation model. the values of n, KA (or KD = 1/KA) and H were directly obtained from these fits. the ribozyme was synthesized from plasmid pAvaplVS derived from plasmid pAvapl (Lacroix-Labont\u00e9 et al. 2012) to allow synthesis of the ribozyme with its substrate at the 3\u2032 end. after 3 h, 15 mM MgCl2 was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h. RNA samples were transferred to ITC buffer supplemented with MgCl2. other MgCl2 concentrations were used to investigate the Mg2+ ion dependence of the I/V kissing-loop interaction. pH of the Tris buffer was adjusted at room temperature. concentrations of the SLI titrants in the syringe were 100 M (SLIpsIa and SLIds1 RNAs), 200 M (SLIsbIa, SLIps, SLIsb, and SLIds2 RNAs), and the concentration of SLV in the cell was 10 times lower than that of the titrants. for ITC titrations with the VS ribozyme catalytic domain control experiment was subtracted from the titration experiment to eliminate the effect of diluting the titrant. data collected for each titration experiment were then fit to a single binding site model or to a dimer-monomer dissociation model."}
