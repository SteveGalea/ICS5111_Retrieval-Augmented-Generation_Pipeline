{"summary": "research explored community perceptions about respiratory infections. community perceptions of respiratory infections include both concerns with imbalances between hot and cold, and with person-to-person transmission. acute respiratory infection is a major cause of child mortality in Bangladesh. it accounts for 21% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years from 2000 to 2004. there was concern for its potential to rapidly spread due to the high population density and lack of respiratory hygiene. symptoms of respiratory infections exist on a continuum from mild to severe. people perceive respiratory illnesses as \"mild\" events even among those who have severe signs and symptoms. some symptoms are related to non-infectious illnesses such as asthma or allergies. the study site at Mirpur included three different socio-economic neighborhoods. we selected participants purposively in both sites to include persons from different settings, ages, socio-economic status, and occupational, educational and religious backgrounds. to recruit religious leaders, we identified the three closest public markets in each of our study sites. we chose 6 h during the busiest times of trading, between 7 AM to 10 AM in the morning and 5 PM to 8 PM in the evening to observe and record the behavior of shopkeepers and customers. data analysis We recorded the in-depth interviews and focus group discussions using audio recorders. transcribed these audio recordings in Bengali, and to describe signs, symptoms and respiratory illness, we retained the local terminology. data saturation occurred after 16 in-depth interviews in urban Mirpur area and 18 in-depth interviews in rural Fulbaria. we selected informants from every tenth household in purposively identified areas near four schools. to recruit religious leaders, we identified the three closest public markets in each of our study sites. we chose 6 h during the busiest times of trading, between 7 AM to 10 AM in the morning and 5 PM to 8 PM in the evening to observe and record the behavior of shopkeepers. we conducted unstructured observations in markets to see respiratory hygiene practices in public places. we took notes about customers' and shopkeepers' behaviors linked to respiratory hygiene. however, we did not count the events as we conducted unstructured observations. 144 participants took part in our focus group discussions. there were 70 adult males and 32 adult females, and 20 school boys and 22 school girls. adult male focus group discussion participants were mostly street vendors or laborers in urban sites. informants used the phrase'shas-proshassh jonito sangkromon' when asked to explain respiratory infection. some answers had no direct relation to respiratory functions such as a stomach ache or skin diseases. a male teacher from the rural site attributed patterns of spread of infection to the direction the wind is blowing. a few informants reported that respiratory infections could be prevented by keeping distance from a person's food or utensils. four informants advised patients to keep warm and stay away from cold water. one 43 year-old female informant from an urban site said a person should not be in contact with cold water for a long time to avoid getting cold/cough. one informant from an urban site said a person should not be in contact with cold water for a long time. informants thought it was not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing or sneezing. if you sneeze 100 times, will you wash your hands 100 times. informants said they can contribute to improving respiratory hygiene by disseminating health messages. informants asked informants to name some diseases transmitted during either breathing or exhalation. some answers had no direct relation to respiratory functions such as a stomach ache or skin diseases. some informants associated with respiratory diseases associated with respiratory infections. respiratory infection could be contracted through blood transfusion, genetic pre-disposition, fate/luck and from contact with dead animals. informants linked catching a cold to imbalances of hot and cold, e.g. ambient temperatures or water temperatures. religious leaders said hygiene was related to cleanliness before prayer time five times a day. they endorsed saying \"Praise be to Allah\" (Alhamdulillah) after sneezing. informants said it was not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing. the teachers, imams and the paramedics said they can contribute to improving respiratory hygiene by disseminating related health messages. the findings suggest local understandings about who gets sick, why, when, how illness spreads and how it can be prevented are varied, and therefore could contribute to the transmission of respiratory infections. our findings related to catching cold are similar to other anthropological and qualitative studies conducted on childhood acute respiratory infection during the 1990s. these studies suggested that people related the occurrence of acute respiratory infection to imbalances of hot and cold in the body, rather than to an infectious agent that can be transmitted from person to person [10,11,17-21]. identifying and understanding examples of these cultural perceptions could help in the development of communication messages. s respiratory hygiene behavior was observed 956 (85%) of 1126 events, children coughed or sneezed into the air. communication messages that remind people to practice these 'good behaviors' on a daily basis could make positive changes in the overall environment. informants indicated that it is not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing and sneezing. our communication message could be to ask people to cough and sneeze into their upper arm or sleeve. health professionals could use local terms to explain transmission of respiratory infections from the bio-medical perspective. \"what are the current practices when people sneeze or cough\" \"what are the current practices when people sneeze or cough\" \"what are the current practices when people sneeze\" guide for focus group discussion Instruction: Every focus group discussion needs to be interactive within the study group. guide for focus group discussion Instruction: Every focus group discussion needs to be interactive within the study group. participants should introduce themselves to the study group. tell us something about the present norms, cultures and practices related to respiratory hygiene/diseases. hand washing after coughing or sneezing into hands or cleaning nasal secretions. Widening distances from nearby people when someone coughs/sneezes or cleans nasal secretions. acknowledges with gratitude the commitment of USAID to its research efforts. thank all the qualitative research officers who collected and processed data."}
