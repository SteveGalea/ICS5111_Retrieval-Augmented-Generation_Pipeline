{"summary": "vaccines are not always effective and viruses have a disquieting ability to become resistant to the limited range of antivirals currently available. new developments suggest that a reevaluation of the antiviral potential of DI genomes would be timely. cloning technology has been applied to influenza virus to generate a homogeneous population of DI genomes that has afforded a previously lacking consistency and reproducibility in experimentation. this approach can inform a search in other virus systems for DI viruses that may be therapeutically and prophylactically useful. a high multiplicity of infection favors the propagation of DI viruses. a high multiplicity of infection favors the propagation of DI viruses. a high multiplicity of infection favors the propagation of DI viruses. there is a reduction in replication of both DI and infectious genomes. there is a fall in the total number of particles (DI virus and infectious virus) produced. amplification of the DI RNA leads to the production of more DI virus and the establishment of more DI virus-protected cells. DI viruses produced by high-multiplicity-of-infection passage varied from preparation to preparation. these mixtures inevitably contained defective genomes that did not interfere effectively (or indeed at all) with the replication of the helper parental virus. this heterogeneity frequently meant promising evidence of in vivo antiviral activity could not be reproduced. synthesis may continue using the nascent RNA as the template to produce an inverted repeat sequence. but the generation of DI viruses is not determined exclusively by the virus itself. a high-fidelity polymerase makes no errors and gives rise to no errors. a low-fidelity, error-prone enzyme generates a great number of DI RNAs. the role of the host cell in vivo is also important as demonstrated by the failure of a DI SFV RNA to be replicated by infectious virus in mouse brain. a small DI RNA is encapsidated in a short particle and can be separated by velocity gradient centrifugation from longer infectious particles. 4 successive gradients were required to completely remove infectivity (7). infection with VSV by the intracerebral or intranasal route in adult mice causes death in 2 to 3 days. work using the intranasal route of inoculation and Northern blotting showed the presence of VSV RNA sequences in the brains of mice inoculated with a high dose of VSV plus a lower relative amount of DI VSV particles (51). however, the presence of DI RNA in the brain did not correlate strongly with protection (52). SFV-infected cells transfected with transcribed DI RNA (41) were similar but differed in length (1,124 and 2,146 nt) the two cloned DI RNA sequences were similar but differed in length (1,124 and 2,146 nt) but only DI virus reconstituted with the smaller DI RNA protected mice from a lethal intranasal SFV infection. a single UV-induced lesion anywhere in the infectious genome kills the infectivity, while the DI virus RNA target is typically only 400 to 500 nucleotides. a single UV-induced lesion anywhere in the infectious genome kills the infectivity, while the DI virus RNA target is typically only 400 to 500 nucleotides. influenza virus particle can have a full-length virion RNA segment or a cognate DI RNA derived from that segment. it is not known if a DI particle can have more than one genome segment replaced with a cognate DI RNA. the position of the deletion is highly variable; hence, there can be a large number of different DI RNA sequences derived from just one virion segment. 244 DI RNA was generated spontaneously from segment 1 of A/Puerto Rico [PR]/8/34 virus (PR8; H1N1) during a reverse genetics experiment to produce infectious virus. it was subsequently cloned and expressed as a DI PR8 virus. a combination in which 244 DI virus predominates over infectious virus. the use of cloned DI RNA has allowed the biological properties of an influenza virus DI RNA to be related to its sequence for the first time. a small dose of DI RNA can be effective as an antiviral. the targeted delivery of a DI influenza virus RNA is an essential requirement for successful treatment. hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins were cloned and used to create a delivery particle that recognizes both types of receptors. this was effective in delivering DI RNA to the respiratory tracts of mice and ferrets, in which NANA 2,3Gal and NANA 2,6Gal predominate. such mice develop an acute respiratory disease of approximately 3 to 7 days' duration which progresses to pneumonia and death through a readily recognizable sequence of a score of 1 indicates a normal healthy mouse and 5 is a dead mouse. helper virus infectivity was removed from the DI virus preparation by UV irradiation for 40 s. the ferret does not usually develop pneumonia and thus is a better model of human influenza than the mouse. a single dose of DI RNA (2 g RNA in 300 g virus protein) given 2 h ahead of infection protected ferrets from infection with 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, significantly reducing severity of all clinical disease parameters. 244 DI virus protects elderly, obese mice from acute infection. it converts a potentially lethal disease into an avirulent infection with no overt symptoms of disease. it reproducibly provides a longer window for prophylaxis and therapy, is effective at a lower concentration, and requires only a single dose. 1.2 g of DI virus protein given 3 to 4 days before heterologous challenge gave significant protection, but homologous protection was effective for a much longer time. therapy with 1.2 g DI virus protein per mouse at 1 day after infection greatly reduced clinical disease and abrogated mortality completely. therapy with 1.2 g DI virus protein at 1 day after infection greatly reduced clinical disease and abrogated mortality completely. DI virus follows the route of infection taken by infectious virus. it binds via its hemagglutinin to target cells and introduces its DI RNA into the cell. DI RNA then moves to the nucleus and is transcribed by its associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into positive-sense antigenome DI RNA and DI mRNA. a higher dose of DI RNA provides longer lasting protection. however, PCR may exaggerate the stability of intact DI RNA. this is the amount contained in 1.2 g 244 DI virus protein. Fig. 3a shows that mice were also protected using 10-fold less DI virus. total number of copies of 244 DI RNA required for protection of a mouse from 10 LD50 of influenza A/WSN virus. de novo-synthesized DI RNA is packaged by the proteins of the infecting virus. the progeny DI virus delivers newly synthesized DI RNA to other cells of the respiratory tract. the activity of the 244 DI RNA is based on a commonality of genome replication. heterologous viruses cannot replicate and amplify the DI genome or be subject to DI virus-mediated genome competition. a possible candidate is type III lambda interferon (IFN-), shown recently to be important in protection against influenza A and B viruses in vivo. an influenza 244 DI virus can protect mice in a type I interferon-dependent manner from heterologous respiratory viruses. resistance to antivirals is well known in the virus world. mutations arising at a rate of approximately 105 nucleotide changes per round of replication were reduced from 105 to 1015. virus DI RNA-mediated protection against influenza A virus infection operates at the genetic level. the chance of an escape mutant arising is 1 in 1040. this is 1025-fold less likely than resistance to the triple HIV-1 therapy. PR8 is safe to use as it has negligible infectivity for people. only a small proportion of people alive today (80 years later) will have been infected with PR8. nascent progeny DI particles spread throughout the respiratory system. 244 DI virus, formulated in 2006, protected against a pandemic influenza A virus that did not exist until 2009. the likelihood of resistance arising is extremely low. mediated protection is effective immediately."}
