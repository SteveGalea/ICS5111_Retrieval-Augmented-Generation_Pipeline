{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine alphacoronavirus. virus infects pigs via the oronasal route and infection of the intestinal epithelial cells results in disease with mortalities of up to 100 % in unprotected piglets. betacoronaviruses may have inherited a host galectin [6] and used it for their own attachment to target cells. the virus lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme. the presence of such an enzyme may be dispensable for IBV. the proteins were used for binding tests with soluble S transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-S protein. the proteins were fused c-terminally to the human IgG Fc portion. soluble spike proteins were incubated with ST-cells and IPI-21 cells. soluble TGEV spike proteins were only detectable when porcine APN was expressed (A,B,D,E) no binding was observed on cells transfected only with empty vector (C,F) neuraminidase pre-treatment revealed an enhanced binding of the soluble spike protein to the cells. s were either pretreated (+NA) or not treated (-NA) with 300 mU neuraminidase. no decrease in binding of soluble spikes was observed after neuraminidase treatment. soluble spike proteins were cloned into the vector pCG1Fc. transfection of BHK-21 cells resulted in the expression of soluble spike-Fc proteins. the proteins were fused c-terminally to the human IgG Fc portion. neuraminidase treatment revealed enhanced binding of the TGEV spike to the cells. binding was only detectable when porcine APN was expressed (A,B,D,E) soluble spike proteins bound to approx. 50 % of the cells. cryosections were either pretreated (+NA) or not treated (-NA) with 300 mU neuraminidase prior to binding of soluble spike proteins. the control cryosections were incubated only with the fluorescence dye (CY3) labeled secondary antibody. soluble spikes bind to the respiratory epithelial cells in a sialic acid-dependent manner. all cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. soluble spikes were generated by fusion of the S1 gene portion to the human IgG Fc gene. cells and cryosections of tissue samples were incubated with soluble spike proteins at a protein concentration of 2g/l or 50l of concentrated supernatent for 1 hour at room temperature. the FITC or CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma Aldrich) directed against the human Fc-tag were incubated with cells or tissue slices also for 1 hour at room temperature. soluble spike proteins were generated by fusion of the S1 gene portion to the human IgG Fc gene and insertion into the vector pCG1. for TGEV, the cDNA of the strain Madrid (genbank accession number: M94101) was used and for IBV the cDNA of the B1648 strain (genbank accession number: X87238. single-cell suspensions were obtained by adding accutase to cell monolayers. sialic acids were released with 200 mU of neuraminidase. soluble spike proteins have lost the ability to bind to sialic acids. a neuraminidase treatment of the cells enhanced the binding of TGEV-S. we conclude that our soluble spike proteins have lost the ability to bind to sialic acids and that the neuraminidase treatment rendered the epitopes on cellular APN more accessible for interaction. we observed with the TGEV spike a weaker binding of a construct with trimerization domain compared to the Fc constructs. binding results with the B1648 spike resemble the tissue tropism of the virus. the virus infects primary chicken kidney cells as well as tracheal organ cultures."}
