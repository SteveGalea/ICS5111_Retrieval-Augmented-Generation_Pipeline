{"summary": "IFNs can synergise with other stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL) 1 for more potent immune responses. Upon IFN binding, receptor-associated janus activated kinases are phosphorylated leading to activation of latent signal transducer and activator of transcription molecules. reconstitution of STAT1 into Ifnar1/ cells could restore IFN-induced STAT1 DNA binding and partially rescued IFN-dependent anti-viral responses. this led to a model of cytokine crosstalk. 109 probes (30.1%) were also induced in Ifnar1/ and/or Ifnar1/MSCV cells and Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells. only 5 of the 440 probes showed significant repression in response 1 hr of IFN treatment in wild type cells. 1 129/C3H MEFs were treated with 100 U/ml IFN for 1, 3 and 6 hrs. mRNA expression was assessed by Affymetrix microarray (n = 3) loss of IFNAR1 expression attenuated IFN responsiveness. we compared the wild type and Ifnar1/ microarray data sets. probes which lacked a significant, >1.2-fold change in expression or had >1.2-fold attenuation of gene regulation. induction of gene expression of 62 (8.4%) and 38 (7.4%) probes with attenuated responses in Ifnar1/ cells was rescued in Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells respectively. the effect of STAT1 reconstitution on IFN-dependent gene regulation was greatest during early phase gene induction. 10 pathways most significantly affected by both the loss of IFNAR1 and reconstitution of STAT1 cells were the IFN/ signaling pathway and multiple JAK/STAT signaling pathways. the most significantly affected pathway was the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1/ cells rescued IFN-dependent induction of RNA expression for a key molecule in antigen presentation, 2 microgloblin (B2M) therefore the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway represented an ideal candidate to validate the attenuation of IFN-dependent biological responses in IFNAR1 deficient cells. MSCV cells were rescued to wild type equivalent levels in ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells following 6 hrs of IFN treatment. PSMB9 expression reached wild type equivalent levels in all IFNAR1 deficient cells by 24 hrs of IFN treatment. significant differences in fold increase in MFI relative to wild type were determined by t-test *p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.001. we assessed the effects of STAT1 on the ability of IFN to regulate cell surface expression of the heavy chain on Ifnar1/ cells. a decrease in basal STAT3 protein expression in 129/C3H MEFs lacking IFNAR1 was related to a significant decrease in RNA expression. we also found reduced STAT3 phosphorylation following IL-6 stimulation of Ifnar1/ cells. Western membrane was re-probed with antibodies specific for Actin to confirm equivalent loading of proteins. expression of each gene was normalized to L32 and untreated wild type MEFs. we also assessed RNA and protein expression of several transcription factors known to regulate IFN responses that were not identified as having attenuated expression in Ifnar1/ cells. c-Jun and Irf1 expressed less c-Jun protein than wild type MEFs. Ifnar1/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was confirmed by western blotting. 109 probes (30.1%) were also induced in Ifnar1/ and/or Ifnar1/MSCV cells and Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells. wild type, Ifnar1/, Ifnar1/MSCV and Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 129/C3H MEFs were treated with 100 U/ml IFN for 1, 3 and 6 hrs. mRNA expression was assessed by Affymetrix microarray (n = 3) repressed expression in wild type MEFs that had attenuated expression are listed below heatmaps. compared wild type and Ifnar1/ microarray data sets. probes which had attenuated IFN responsiveness lacked a significant, >1.2-fold change in expression. cells following 1 hr of IFN treatment, 43 (13.8%) probes rescued IFN responsiveness in Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells. induction of gene expression of 62 (8.4%) and 38 (7.4%) probes with attenuated responses was rescued in Ifnar1/HA-STAT1 cells respectively. among the 10 pathways most significantly affected by both the loss of IFNAR1 and reconstitution of STAT1 cells were the IFN/ signaling pathway and multiple JAK/STAT signaling pathways. the most significantly affected pathway was the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway (Fig. 2A-B). STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1/ cells rescued IFN-dependent induction of RNA expression for a key molecule in antigen presentation, 2 microgloblin (B2M) therefore the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway represented an ideal candidate to validate the attenuation of IFN-dependent biological responses in IFNAR1 deficient cells. PSMB9 expression reached wild type equivalent levels in all IFNAR1 deficient cell lines by 24 hrs of IFN treatment. this suggests that IFNAR1 expression was required for early, but not late phases responses. untreated for 11\u201313 independent experiments and error bars are SEM. significant changes in MFI relative to untreated (fold increase in MFI) were determined by t-test #p 0.05, ##p 0.01, ###p 0.001. in unstimulated Ifnar1/ cells, there was attenuated RNA expression of Stat1 and Stat2 but not Socs3. this was determined by microarray and qRT-PCR analysis (Stat1 and Socs3). ml IL-6 and 100ng/ml IL-6R for 30mins were separated by SDS-PAGE. western membrane was re-probed with antibodies specific for pSTAT3. expression of each gene was normalized to L32 and untreated wild type MEFs. type I IFN signaling pathway confirmed the reduced expression of genes involved in TLR and NF-B signaling, Myd88, Nfkbia and Nfkbie. we also assessed RNA and protein expression of several transcription factors known to regulate IFN responses. crosstalk can occur at the level of gene promoters as a result of multiple promoter binding sites or chromatin priming. we had previously established that STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1/ cells rescued IFN-dependent STAT1 activation and DNA binding. however, the ability of STAT1 to rescue IFN responses diminished over time. reconstitution significantly rescued IFN responsiveness were both enriched for immune responses, apoptosis and alternate cytokine signaling pathways. the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway was the most sensitive to loss of IFNAR1. expression of STAT1 had profound effect on IFN-dependent regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation. other IFN-dependent responses, including regulation of genes involved in development, were not rescued by STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1/- MEFs. all experiments were performed in accordance with the animal ethics guidelines ascribed by the national health and medical research council of Australia. all experiments were approved by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center Animal Ethics Committee.
