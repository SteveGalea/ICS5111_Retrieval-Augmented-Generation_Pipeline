{"summary": "researchers have proposed several approaches to achieve near real-time surveillance of the emergence and spread of influenza. some novel approaches for rapid disease outbreak detection and surveillance include online surveillance systems utilizing informal sources such as news reports [2], social media data [3]\u2013[16], and search query data [17]\u2013[20]. the wide use of Baidu in china makes it a more representative search query source for this analysis. the wide use of Baidu in china makes it a more representative search query source for this analysis. the approach in this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) search for keywords or terms which might be related to influenza; (ii) process keywords by eliminating those unrelated to influenza epidemics; (iii) define weights and composite search index; (iv) fit regression model using selected keyword index to influenza case data. search query data from baidu Baidu\u2019s database contains logs of online search query volume submitted from June 2006. but since the influenza case count data is available from March 2009, we use Baidu\u2019s data from March 2009 to August 2012. keywords recommended by search engines tend to be comprehensive, but not always relevant to the subject. further analysis is required to extract keywords, which are most pertinent to the study. h1n1 (type a flu) (flu concept stock) (the price of influenza vaccine) h1n1 (type a flu) (shandong flu) (shandong flu) (Hongkong flu) (how to prevent flu) h1n1 (type a h1n1 flu) (the prevention measures of influenza) (h1n1 influenza) (goat flu) (seasonal flu) h3n2(h3n2 flu virus) h1n1(h1n1 influenza symptom) (transmission way of flu) h3(type a h3 flu) (influenza vaccine adverse reaction) h1n1(type a h1n1 flu) (influenza pandemic) (type a flu symptoms) (influenza vaccine side effects) (influenza vaccinations) (the symptom of h1n1 flu) (prevention of type a flu) ( h1n1(h1n1 knowledge of influenza prevention) h1n1(h1n1 knowledge of influenza prevention) h1n1(h1n1 flu) h1n1(h1n1 knowledge of influenza prevention) h1n1(h1n1 flu) the final set of keywords is selected using the following model: (1) In (1), represents the search index for j keywords, y denotes influenza case counts, denote the intercept, coefficient and error term respectively. partial F test is used to evaluate the goodness of fit after adding data for each keyword to the index. the influenza case data is divided into a fitting and validation set. data from March 2009 to December 2011 is used for model fitting. data from January 2012 to august 2012 is used for validation. search query data from baidu Baidu\u2019s database (http://index.baidu.com/) contains logs of online search query volume submitted from June 2006. Unlike the case data from the Ministry of Health, Baidu\u2019s search query data is available on a daily basis. the data in this study is solely for seasonal influenza. no ethics committee approval is required to obtain the data. only count data is presented, no personal information is revealed. keywords are carefully selected to reflect terms most likely associated with influenza epidemics. the marginal contribution of adding terms to a \u201csaturated\u201d model is limited, but costly. correlation coefficient of at least 0.4 with the influenza case data. h1n1(h1n1 flu) (new flu) (benshan Happy camp swine flu) (influenza drugs) (type a influenza) (influenza vaccine) (knowledge of influenza prevention) up influenza(song) (seasonal influenza vaccine) qq(qq(qq flu game download) h1n1(the knowledge of type a h1n1 influenza) (prevention of type a h1n1 flu) (love flu) h1n1(prevention of type a h1n1 flu) (prevention of type a h1n1 flu) (love flu) h1n1(prevention of type a h1n1 flu) (prevention of type a h1n1 flu) (love flu h1n1 (prevention and control type a h1n1 flu) (love flu virus) (Beijing flu) (up influenza(song) Guan Ying) h3n2(type a h3n2 flu virus) (dog influenza) (How to prevent influenza a) (Shandong swine flu) (Para-influenza) (the symptom of h1n1 flu) h1n1(h the method of systematic assessment [34], [35] involves rating the selected indicator according to the principle of prior evaluation. the method is comprehensive but highly subjective. Alternatively, the correlation coefficient between the influenza epidemic curve and the keyword frequency curve can be used to represent the weight [18], [33] the most significant correlations between the composite index and the case data are observed at lag 0 (P = 0.959) and lag 1 (P = 0.658) correlations at lags 2 and 3 are 0.491 and 0.227 respectively. we therefore fit the following model: (2) ICD represents influenza case data, are the coefficients, index is the composite search index and is the error term. s of the influenza time series curve, thereby making it a good indicator for influenza activity in China. t-Stat is the abbreviation for augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. the results are listed in Figure 2 and Table 5. The mean absolute percent error of prediction for the consecutive eight months is 10.6%. we also consider models with second order lags and third order lags but neither of their statistical results are better than model [2]. china has been coined the \u201cepicenter of influenza\u201d [39] by some. however, there are several limitations to using search query data. these tools are freely available in near real-time and can be especially valuable in regions where official reports of case counts are delayed."}
