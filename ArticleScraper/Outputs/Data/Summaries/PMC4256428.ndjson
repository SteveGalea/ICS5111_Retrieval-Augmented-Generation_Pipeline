{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus. it is the first lineage 2C Betacoronavirus known to infect humans. this is the second known zoonotic introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus, probably originating from bats. dromedary camels have been implicated as probable intermediate hosts. MERS-CoV uses the DPP4 receptor to gain entry and effectively replicate in camel cell lines. the exact mode of transmission from camels to humans remains to be confirmed. the CDC defines a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV as a patient with a positive PCR from a respiratory sample. the average age of presentation is 50 years, with a male predominance. most asymptomatic cases have been discovered through screening after contact with a known case. there is still a lack of surgical and pathological information from patients infected with MERS-CoV. co-infection with other respiratory viruses and with community-acquired bacteria has been also reported in MERS-CoV patients. the cases so far have been acquired either directly through a probable zoonotic source, or as result of human\u2013human transmission via close contact. cases have also been reported in Kuwait, Yemen, Oman, Iran, Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, Bangladesh, Tunisia, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, and the united states. the identification of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia has generated international concern of a global pandemic. the identification of MERS-CoV in mecca has generated international concern of a global pandemic. the development of vaccines targeting the RBSD of MERS-CoV is under investigation. they are thought to be safer and more effective than vaccines based on inactivated virus, DNA, or viral vectors. no effective therapy or prophylaxis for MERS-CoV exists to date. cycloheximide, anisomycin, and emetine dihydrochloride hydrate were found to have the most potent in vitro activity against MERS-CoV. the definitive origin, exact mechanism of transmission, and the reason behind seasonal variability are still unclear. the increasing travel to the region and the Hajj season in KSA pose a potential global pandemic."}
