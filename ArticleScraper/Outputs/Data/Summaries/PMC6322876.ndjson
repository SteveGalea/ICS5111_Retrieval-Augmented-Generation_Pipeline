{"summary": "many people die every year due to viral infection. dengue virus, including four serotypes (DENV 1\u20134), is an emerging threat to billions of people worldwide (2). a scorpion venom peptide, Ev37, derived from Euscorpiops validus can inhibit DENV-2 (TSV01 strain) infection in a dose-dependent manner at noncytotoxic concentrations. rEv37 was found to inhibit DENV-2, HCV, ZIKV, and HSV-1 in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on SeV and AdV. recombinant scorpion venom peptide Ev37 obtained as described previously. amino acid sequence alignment indicates that Ev37 is a scorpine-like peptide, whose N terminus is likely an -helix, and C terminus is a conserved CS scaffold. the cDNA sequence of the mature peptide was cloned into the expression vector pET-32a with restriction enzyme sites KpnI\u2013XhoI to express rEv37 in E. coli BL21(DE3). the peptide rEv37 was expressed and purified as described under \u201cMaterials\u201d. the peptide rEv37 was eluted at 22 min and was collected. the results showed that there was an obvious band nearly at 25 kDa after being induced. rEv37 inhibits DENV-2, HCV, and ZIKV in vitro at noncytotoxic concentrations. the inhibitory ability of the peptide rEv37 against DENV-2 infection was determined via real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) for mRNA in the infected cells and was then found to reduce 23, 41, 68, and 91% of DENV-2 at the concentrations of 1, 2, 5, and 10 m respectively. rEv37 could also inhibit DENV-2 at the protein level in a concentration-dependent manner. rEv37 inhibited intracellular HCV RNA (D), extracellular HCV RNA (E) and intracellular HCV core protein (F) in vitro. the peptide inhibited intracellular ZIKV RNA (G) and intracellular ZIKV E protein (H) rEv37 was slightly virucidal for DENV-2 particles (23%) and had a similar effect on HCV particles (16%) rEv37 reduced DENV-2 infection (42%) and HCV infection (34%) when cells were pretreated with rEv37 for 1 h. unabsorbed virus was removed by washing three times with PBS.
