{"summary": "Zika virus belongs to the virus family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus, initially isolated from Zika forest in Uganda (Dick, 1952) chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses circulated in sub-Saharan africa, south and Southeast Asian and South Pacific countries. a large epidemic of ZIKV infection in Brazil was considered to have been associated with a remarkable increase in the number of microcephaly cases the transmission potential of ZIKV infection has been shown to be comparable to those of DENV and CHIKV (Nishiura et al., 2016a). the control option of Aedes spp. includes source reduction (i.e., removal of water and covering water storage containers), the use of ovitrap, chemical control, bioinsecticides and biological control (e.g., mosquitofish) a seroepidemiological study identified the local transmission. the median week was used as the week of importation. the latest time at which the importation week was systematically examined was 31 January 2016. the presence of Aedes species, DENV and CHIKV were all dealt with as dichotomous variables. the presence of Aedes species, DENV and CHIKV were all dealt with as dichotomous variables. the function Fj(t) describes the probability that ZIKV has been imported to a country j by time t. the effective distance mj of a country j from the country of origin is calculated as the minimum of the all possible effective lengths of path that goes from the origin country to the country j. the effective distance has been known as an excellent predictor of the arrival time of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and influenza pH1N1 2009. the risk of local transmission in a country j is modeled as g j t = p j f j t. in order to estimate pj, the conditional probability of experiencing local transmission, we use datasets of the presence of Aedes species, CHIKV and DENV in each country. the survival time for those countries is considered to be at least as long as the duration of our study. the likelihood function reads L k, a 0, i; t j, x j, t m = j A p j f j f j t j j C 1 F j t m. the optimal cut-off value of estimated risk was calculated using youden\u2019s index. the prediction has been made in week 92 that corresponds to the end of 2016. a total of 230 airports and 4,600 flight routes were obtained between each pair of countries. the country-specific presence of Aedes species, especially focusing on Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africana, was explored. the effective distance mj of a country j from the country of origin is calculated as the minimum of all possible effective lengths of path that goes from the origin country to the country j. the effective distance has been known as an excellent predictor of the arrival time of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and influenza pH1N1 2009. model pj by using logit model p j = 1 1 + exp a 0 + i i x j i, (5) where xji is an intercept, xji is the dichotomous variable that describes the presence of Aedes mosquitoes in country j. in total, we predict the risks of importation and local transmission among 189 countries. the model was fitted at week 46 since importation in Brazil. five countries have experienced importation and confirmation in February 2016. the prediction has been made in week 92 that corresponds to the end of 2016. 39 countries have experienced importation by the end of January 2016. the week number of the report has been originally written and we used it as the week of importation. the mid-point of the available time window was used as the week of importation. the first day of the year was set to be the first Sunday of January. 64 Guatemala 2015 47 3,557 Vietnam 1954 26 364 Mexico 2015 48 3,558 Angola 1960 22 672 Venezuela 2015 48 3,558 Kenya 1967 26 1,040 Netherlands 2015 48 3,558 Ethiopia 1967 26 1,040 Panama 2015 48 3,558 Somalia 1967 26 1,040 Paraguay 2015 48 3,558 Gabon 1967 26 1,040 Honduras 2015 51 3,561 Nigeria 1968 26 1,092 Cape Verde 2015 51 3,561 Central African Republic 1968 26 1,092 Spain 2015 52 3,562 Senegal 1968 26 1,09 maximum likelihood estimate of constant parameter k was 0.044 (95% CI [0.031\u20130.059]) Sensitivity and specificity were estimated at 77.5% (95% CI [64.6\u201390.4] and 85.9% (95% CI [80.3\u201391.5] respectively. Among the top 30 countries predicted at high risk of ZIKV importation in the end of 2016. the origin country, Brazil, is colored in grey. other countries colored in grey were excluded because they experienced importation of ZIKV infection prior to the event in Brazil. local transmission (Chikungunya) 0.89 (0.62, 1.00) 18.6 71.4 (54.7, 88.2) 93.2 (89.3, 97.1) 3 Local transmission (Dengue) 0.84 (0.54, 1.00) 17.4 67.9 (50.6, 85.2) 91.9 (87.7, 96.1) 4 Local transmission (Aedes & Chikungunya) 0.89 (0.61, 1.00) 14.7 85.7 (72.8, 98.7) kappa > 0.60 was identified. Table 3. Estimated parameters for describing the local transmission risk of Zika virus infection. the best model included Chikungunya and Dengue as explanatory variables. potentially high importation risk in many temperate countries has motivated us to explore the risks of importation and local transmission fuelled by travellers. our model is not as sophisticated as mapping precise risk of transmission using seasonal population dynamics of Aedes species. but the findings at country levels are broadly consistent with what has been briefly described at finer scales. the sensitivity of our best model was 96.4%, indicating that there would be a number of countries in which ZIKV transmission has yet to occur even in the presence of DENV and CHIKV. the simple model must have missed important additional predictors of local transmission in this regard, and such predictors have to be sought in the future studies. countries with deNV and CHIKV epidemic experience are likely to be at particular high risk. countries should be prepared for vector control measures such as avoiding daytime biting and the use of mosquito repellent. the risk of local transmission was well explained by the airline transportation network data. Yuichiro Miyamatsu performed the experiments, analyzed the data. Yohei Yasuda and Ryo Kinoshita analyzed the data, wrote the paper, prepared figures and/or tables."}
