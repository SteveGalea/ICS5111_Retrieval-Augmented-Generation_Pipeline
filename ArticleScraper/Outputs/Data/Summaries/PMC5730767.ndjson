{"summary": "the type I interferon (IFN) system is the first line of antiviral defense. it is an important part of the intrinsic innate immune response that controls virus dissemination and protects against serious disease. the genus Flavivirus comprises important human pathogens transmitted by mosquitos and ticks. tetherin and viperin (virus inhibitory protein, ER associated, IFN inducible) have been shown to affect assembly and release of viruses. it inhibits release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral particles by anchoring the virion to the plasma membrane (10) e synthase (FPPS), an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, leads to altered fluidity of lipid rafts, thereby interfering with virus budding (21, 22) viperin also inhibits genome replication of DENV and HCV by interacting with viral nonstructural proteins. IFN treatment on particle assembly was measured by quantifying the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate) compared to control treatment, IFN-B/D treatment led to a strong increase in C protein release, while the secretion of E protein remained unaltered. a flotation assay was performed to characterize the nature of the secreted C protein. a flotation assay was used to determine the membrane association of C protein, prME VLPs, or LGTV. the gradient was fractionated from top to bottom and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed, together with prME or C. a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed. brefeldin A blocks retrograde transport via COPI vesicles and the secretion from the trans-Golgi compartment via clathrin-coated vesicles. this leads to a collapse of the Golgi compartment into the ER and blocks the release of proteins via this pathway. BFA effectively inhibited the secretion of prME particles. TBEV is budding into the ER and a prominent ISG that localizes to this compartment is viperin. the effect on TBEV particle release is greater than the effect on RNA replication (19), suggesting an involvement of viperin in particle. a 293 FLP-IN T Rex cell line inducibly expressing TBEV Hypr prME was treated with 1 g/ml tet and transfected with wt viperin and TBE Hypr C 3 FLAG (C-FLAG) western blot analysis showed the intracellular and secreted proteins. increasing amounts of plasmid expressing 1-50 were transfected into HeLa cells. expression of viperin was measured with or without wt viperin expression. expression of viperin did not have an effect on TBEV prME-particle secretion or NS1 protein secretion. 293 FLP-IN T Rex cells inducibly expressing viperin were infected with a high multiplicity of LGTV. the antiviral effect was stronger on released viral particles and infectivity. the total amount of C protein in the supernatant compared to the E protein was greatly enhanced in the presence of viperin. blots of E and C from the lysate (A) and released particles (B) from three independent experiments. blots of E and C from the cell lysate measured by real-time RT-PCR. the proteins were digested with trypsin and LysC. the peptides were purified and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. the hyperbolic line delineates nonsignificantly to significantly enriched proteins. protein input, and immunoprecipitation (IP) graphs show the quantification of IP GBF1 (means and standard deviations from three independent experiments) 115 proteins specifically binding to viperin or the 1-50 mutant identified 34 proteins that were significantly more enriched in the wt protein precipitates compared to precipitations with the mutant protein (Fig. 6D, red and green dots) eGFP-GBF1 localized to vesicular structures surrounded by viperin. the colocalization between GBF1 and the N-terminal 1 to 50 amino acids of viperin in such structures was even more pronounced. the steady-state distribution of GBF1 was not altered in presence of viperin. viperin-induced increase of C-particle release could be inhibited by overexpression of YFP-GBF1 and transient knockdown of GBF1 with CRISPR Cas9 induced the C-particle release. viperin sequester GBF1 to induce C-particle release. the amounts of protein in the supernatant and cell lysate were measured by immunoblotting at 48 h after the second transfection. the amounts of protein in the supernatant were measured by immunoblotting at 48 h after the second transfection. the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate) was measured by quantifying the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate) compared to control treatment, IFN-B/D treatment led to a strong increase in C protein release. a flotation assay was performed to characterize the nature of the secreted C protein. a flotation assay was used to determine the membrane association of C protein, prME VLPs, or LGTV. the gradient was fractionated from top to bottom and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed, together with prME or C, and progeny particles were monitored. the overexpression of Sar1-H79G blocked both prME and C. the cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) which blocks retrograde transport via COPI vesicles and the secretion from the trans-Golgi compartment via clathrin-coated vesicles. this leads to a collapse of the Golgi compartment into the ER and thus blocks the release of proteins via this pathway. BFA effectively inhibited the secretion of prME particles. immunoblot analysis shows intracellular expression of E and C, and also E and C secreted from transfected HeLa cells treated with 0.5 g/ml BFA. the graphs show the quantification (means and standard deviations from n = 3 [C, D, and E] and n = 4 [F] Western blot experiments) in a new tab Viperin colocalizes with C and E and induces C-particle release via its N-terminal domain. a 293 FLP-IN T Rex cell line inducibly expressing TBEV Hypr prME was treated with 1 g/ml tet and transfected with wt viperin. Increasing amounts of plasmid expressing 1-50 were transfected into HeLa cells, together with C-FLAG. expression of viperin did not have an effect on TBEV prME-particle secretion. expression of viperin did not have an effect on NS1 protein secretion. 293 FLP-IN T Rex cells inducibly expressing viperin were infected with a high multiplicity of LGTV. the antiviral effect was stronger on released viral particles and infectivity. the total amount of C protein in the supernatant compared to the E protein was greatly enhanced in presence of viperin. viperin induces C protein release both during viral infection and in transfected transfected cells expressing C protein. this function requires localization to the ER and does not impair other cellular secretion systems. lysis conditions and proteins were precipitated using FLAG beads. the proteins were digested with trypsin and LysC. the peptides were purified and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. we identified 115 proteins specifically binding to viperin or the 1-50 mutant. direct comparison of viperin to the 1-50 mutant identified 34 proteins that were significantly more enriched in the wt protein precipitates compared to precipitations with the mutant protein. eGFP-GBF1 localized to vesicular structures surrounded by viperin. eGFP-GBF1 localized to vesicular structures surrounded by viperin. no effect of Golgicide was detected on prME secretion. viperin-induced increase of C-particle release could be inhibited by overexpression of YFP-GBF1 and transient knockdown of GBF1 with CRISPR Cas9 induced the C-particle release. viperin sequester GBF1 to induce C-particle release. the amounts of protein in the supernatant and cell lysate were measured by immunoblotting at 48 h after the second transfection. the amounts of protein in the supernatant and cell lysate were measured by immunoblotting at 48 h after the second transfection. secretion of both C particles and prME VLPs was found to be dependent on the conventional COPII secretory pathway. only prME VLPs appeared be released via the Golgi compartment through conventional secretion. both viperin and GBF1 are able to peripherally attach to membranes of the ER. GBF1 is necessary for RNA replication of DENV, HCV, and SARS coronavirus (35\u201337), for particle assembly of Ebola virus and influenza A virus (38, 39), and for targeting of DENV C protein to lipid droplets. an interaction between DENV C protein and the N-terminal of viperin localized to vesicular structures, together with GBF1. a similar type of hydrophobic membrane association of the C protein has been suggested for deNV, yellow fever virus, and west Nile virus (44, 45) and even tick-borne flaviviruses (LGTV, Powassan, and TBEV) notably, the C protein appears to have an intrinsic ability in vitro to assemble into particles even in the absence of membranes. viperin is known to have an antiviral effect against a broad range of viruses. most of these viruses use GBF1 for their life cycles (35, 39, 53) most of these viruses use GBF1 for their life cycles (35, 39, 53) the eGFP-GBF1-wt plasmid was generated from the YFP-GBF-wt plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. the mCherry-viperin was constructed by lifting viperin from pI.18 into a mCherry backbone. secondary antibodies included actin (rabbit polyclonal; Sigma), FLAG epitope (mouse monoclonal; chicken polyclonal; and rabbit polyclonal [Sigma]), HA epitope (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam), viperin (rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal; Abcam), calnexin (rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal; Abcam), GM130 (mouse monoclo confocal images were acquired using a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon) with a 60 oil immersion lens (Plan-Apochromat VC) for live-cell microscopy, 140,000 HeLa cells were seeded in a 35-mm MatTek glass-bottom dish.
