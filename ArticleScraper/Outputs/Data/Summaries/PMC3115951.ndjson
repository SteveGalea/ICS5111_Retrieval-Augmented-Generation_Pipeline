{"summary": "PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo dalton cellular inhibitor (P58IPK) the protein is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. however the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58IPK activation was hitherto unknown. NP is the viral factor responsible for P58IPK activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection. PKR is tightly regulated by cellular inhibitors and often targeted by viral proteins [17]\u2013[20]. NS1 of influenza virus directly binds to PKR and prevents its activation [21], [22]. PKR activity is also inhibited by a cellular 58 kDa protein, P58IPK. in nave cells, P58IPK exists in an inactive state in a complex with heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), which becomes active upon release from this complex [28], [29]. expression of IAV NP in mammalian cells leads to reduced phosphorylation of PKR and its substrate eIF2. RNAi-mediated inhibition of NP expression in IAV infected cells enhanced the phosphorylation of PKR and its downstream substrate eIF2. NP-Hsp40 interaction in mammalian cells was ascertained using co-immunoprecipitation of plasmids coding H5N1 NP and Hsp40 in the HEK293T cells. ectopically expressed NP could immunoprecipitate endogenous cellular Hsp40 and vice-versa (Fig. 1A, lane 2 and 4). HEK293T cells were pcDNA3.1-NP and pcDNA3.1-Hsp40 plasmids alone or in combination, followed by metabolic labeling with S35. 48 hours post-transfection cells were harvested and IP was setup using anti-NP-specific antibody and anti-Hsp40-specific antibody followed by autoradiography. a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using infected and control cell extracts. PR8 NP was able to co-precipitate endogenous Hsp40 (Fig. 2B, panel 2). Conversely, Hsp40 was able to co-precipitate NP. panel 1 shows NP reached its maximum levels at 12 hours post-infection. B. A549 cells were infected with different influenza A virus isolates. panel 2 shows co-IP of NP with Hsp40 and lane 2 of panel 2 shows co-IP with NP. sequence unavailable IAV NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus of mammalian cells. NP and cellular Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus of mammalian cells. panels are labeled for their respective staining. lower right panel shows nuclear colocalization of NP and Hsp40. C and D. A549 cells were infected with PR8 influenza A virus at 1 MOI. NP expression in IAV infected cells coincides with p-PKR and p-eIF2 downregulation and P58IPK-Hsp40 dissociation. western blotting was done to check the expression levels of PKR, p-PKR, eIF2, p-eIF2, NP and NS1. Western blot analysis of transfected cell lysate showed downregulation of both PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation. NP may also play a role in inhibiting PKR activity by intercepting this pathway at the level of Hsp40. hek293T cells were transfected with NP expressing plasmid (pcDNA3.1-NP) or control plasmid (pcDNA3.1-NP) cells were harvested at 36 hours post-transfection and cell lysates were subject to western blotting analysis. panel 2 shows significant downregulation of pPKR levels in NP transfected cells. panel 2 shows significant downregulation of p-eIF2 levels in NP transfected cells. panel 1 shows NP expression level, whereas panel 3 shows equal loading trough -Actin control. expression of NS1 was also blocked using siRNA against NS1 alone. cells were harvested 24 h post-infection and cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis. inhibition of NP expression led to upregulation of PKR phosphorylation. Lane 3 in panel 1, 2 and 4 shows levels of p-PKR, p-eIF2 and p-IRF3 levels in case of NP inhibition. Lane 5 shows synergistic effect of NP silencing on p-PKR, p-eIF2 and p-IRF3 levels. inhibition of NP or NS1 led to reduced vRNA production. inhibition of both NP and NS1 together had greater synergistic effect. mRNA levels were normalized against actin. NP-Hsp40 interaction in mammalian cells was ascertained using co-transfection of plasmids coding H5N1 NP and Hsp40 in the HEK293T cells. ectopically expressed NP could immunoprecipitate endogenous cellular Hsp40 and vice-versa. pcDNA3.1-NP and pcDNA3.1-Hsp40 plasmids were tranfected with NP. cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and IP was setup using anti-NP-specific antibody and anti-Hsp40-specific antibody followed by autoradiography. NP expression was maximal at 24 h post-infection, but Hsp40 expression levels remained unchanged throughout the course of infection. a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using infected and control cell extracts. NP co-precipitated with Hsp40 in all cases without exception. panel 1 shows NP reached its maximum levels at 12 hours post-infection. panel 1 shows NP reached its maximum levels at 12 hours post-infection. panel 2 shows that Hsp40 levels remained unchanged through the course of infection. NP Sequence unavailable 4 Influenza A/California/08/2009 (H1N1) (Pandemic Flu) GenBank:FJ984366.1 5 Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) NP Sequence unavailable 6 Influenza A/Hong Kong/482/97 (H5N1) NP Sequence unavailable IAV NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus of mammalian cells NP was stained using anti-Myc tag specific primary antibody and Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody (Green). nuclei were stained with DAPI. A shows pcDNA3.1-NP transfected cells whereas B shows control pcDNA3.1 transfected cells. NP expression in IAV infected cells coincides with p-PKR and p-eIF2 downregulation and P58IPK-Hsp40 dissociation. A549 cells were infected with PR8 IAV at 1 MOI and cells were harvested at indicated time points post-infection. we hypothesized that NP might disrupt the P58IPK-Hsp40 complex too. NP may also play a role in inhibiting PKR activity by intercepting this pathway at the level of Hsp40. Western blot analysis of transfected cell lysate showed downregulation of both PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation. the 36 h time-point was selected to confirm this action of NP. western blot analysis results from 3 independent experiments showed significant reduction in the levels of p-PKR and p-eIF2. Lane 1 of panel 2 shows significant downregulation of p-eIF2 levels in NP transfected cells. panel 1 shows NP expression level, whereas panel 3 shows equal loading trough -Actin control. inhibition of NP expression leads to upregulation of PKR, eIF2 and IRF3 phosphorylation. expression of NS1 was also blocked using siRNA against NS1 alone. infected cells were harvested 24 h post-infection and cell lysates were subject to western blot analysis. p-PKR, p-eIF2 and p-IRF3 levels in cells harvested at 24 hours post-infection. lane 2 shows effect of control siRNA on the same. expression led to increased IFN production as compared to control. increased IFN production should lead to reduced virus replication and reduced production of influenza vRNA. inhibition of both NP and NS1 together had greater synergistic effect. HIV type 1 Nef protein interacts with Hsp40 to enhance viral gene expression. Hsp40 is also known to interact with the HBV core protein. heat shock proteins are known to affect viral replication of influenza viruses also. PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, which in phosphorylated state cannot participate in mRNA translation [12] another crucial host pathway which is activated by PKR is IRF3-mediated IFN production. viral NS1 protein is known to bind directly to PKR and inhibit its activation [20], [21]. NP-Hsp40 interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen. it was confirmed in transfected cells and in influenza virus infected cells. the interaction was found to be conserved across different influenza A viruses. NP and NS1 have similar effects on PKR mediated eIF2 phosphorylation. but their synergistic effect was higher than their individual effects. NP inhibition during IAV infection led to enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation. the effect of NP on IFN production is also reflected on virus replication. this effect may also be attributed to the essential requirement of NP for proper functioning of influenza virus polymerase. but the inhibitory action of NP on PKR-mediated host response may also contribute to the reduced virus replication in case of siRNA-mediated inhibition. ned in pGBK vector (Clontech) was used as bait and prey plasmids. full-length human Hsp40 gene was cloned into pGAD vector. colonies which grew on L-T-H- plates were considered positive. all virus infections were done at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 h in DMEM medium supplemented with 2% BSA. cells were washed with DMEM once and then grown with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA and 1 g/ml N-p-tosyl-1-phenyl alanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) NP was immunoprecipitated using anti-NP monoclonal antibody. immunofluorescence microscopy After infection or transfection for 24 h, A549 cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature.
