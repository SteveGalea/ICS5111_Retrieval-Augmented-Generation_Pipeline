{"summary": "miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) direct interaction and its effect on virus replication in mosquitoes is still unclear. cellular miRNAs of mosquito Aedes aegypti, a vector for many arboviral diseases, may directly interact with three major arboviruses. ingested virus must disseminate through internal tissues and organs before reaching salivary glands to be transmitted. each barrier has different tissue-specific immune properties. key roles are played by small RNA/RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. piRNAs are 24\u201330 nt in size and produced in a Dicer-independent manner. piRNA molecules interact with Argonaute-3 (Ago-3) and Piwi proteins in a so-called \u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism which amplifies these small RNAs. both siRNA and piRNA antiviral immunity could be triggered by the direct binding of small RNA on the viral RNA genome. miRNA antiviral immunity in mosquitoes was shown to facilitate the replication of dengue virus (DENV) or west Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes. some miRNAs reported in Aedes spp could be triggered by virus infection leading to a down-regulation of metalloprotease, which is essential for virus replication. aae-miR-2b-3p is up-regulated in response to CHIKV infection. aae-miR-2b-3p is up-regulated in response to CHIKV infection. only a few studies have shown that mosquito miRNAs interfere with virus replication via complementarity with viral RNA genome. compared small RNA sequencing data from Ae. aegypti to virus sequence data of three major arboviruses, e.g., CHIKV, DENV (serotypes 1\u20134), and ZIKV. the biological meaning of the prediction results was only important after experimental validation. total of 261, 1671, 1244, 884, 164, and 157 complete viral genomes of CHIKV, DENV1\u20134 and ZIKV were retrieved from ViPR as data input for miRNA-vRNA prediction. the viruses from each genotype were chosen for further analysis, as they showed the highest number of potential miRNA binding sites. AAEL000577 (15.89 kcal/mol) were commonly predicted by both miRanda and TargetSpy. a potential binding site for aae-miR-286b-3p at the 3\u2032UTR could be detected at two distinct positions by miRanda and TargetSpy. total of 261, 1671, 1244, 884, 164, and 157 complete viral genomes of CHIKV, DENV1\u20134 and ZIKV were retrieved from ViPR as data input for miRNA-vRNA prediction. the viruses from each genotype were chosen for further analysis. a potential binding site for aae-miR-286b-3p at the 3\u2032UTR could be detected at two distinct positions by miRanda and TargetSpy. 93 potential binding sites could be found in CHIKV genome, 151, 130, 123, and 98 potential binding sites found in the genomes of DENV1\u20134, respectively. CHIKV belongs to the family of Togaviridae and the genus Alphavirus. three CHIKV genotypes circulating worldwide. one additional CHIKV lineage, Indian Ocean lineage (IOL), emerged in 2004\u20135 from the ECSA phylogroup. aegypti miRNAs were sorted by the conservation of target sites that might show a more general miRNA-vRNA interaction. the most common in each virus group were listed in Supplementary Table S1. the highest number of shared binding sites was between ECSA and IOL genotypes (n = 18), while WA and Asian genotypes were relatively independent to each other. p, aae-miR-305-5p, aae-miR-34-3p, and aae-miR-996-3p may be targeted by aae-miR-285-5p and aae-miR-989-3p. the other miRNA binding site may potentially be targeted by aae-miR-iab-4-5p in the 3\u2032UTR of ECSA and IOL genotype a total of 28, 30, 34, 33, and 26 potential binding sites were found in genotypes I, II, III, IV, and V respectively. only two potential miRNA binding sites were common to all five genotypes of DENV-1, which could be targeted respectively by aae-miR-1-3p and aae-miR-282-5p on the capsid and NS3 protein coding regions. DENV-2 Five genotypes of DENV-2 were selected for our analysis. a total of 28, 31, 21, 22, and 28 potential binding sites were found on each genotype respectively. binding sites for aae-miR-316-5p, and aae-miR-9c-5p were common to all five genotypes. aae-miR-124-3p, aae-miR-281-3p, and aae-miR-998-3p were predicted to target the NS4A, prM, and 3\u2032UTR regions. the capsid region was predicted to have two target sites for aae-miR-316-5p (except genotype I) and one target site for aae-miR-79-3p. ZIKV caused a total of 51,473 suspected cases and more than 4300 cases of microcephaly in Brazil by March 2016 [93,94] the virus spread to at least 33 countries or areas in the Americas [93,95] related to DENV, ZIKV belongs to the Flaviviridae family and the genus Flavivirus. aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-286b-3p, and aae-miR-34-3p were predicted to target the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032UTR region of ZIKV. aae-miR-286a-3p has an additional potential binding site on the NS5 region. a total of 674 miRNA-vRNA interactions were predicted consensually by both algorithms for each virus. each miRNA could target multiple viruses, has a relatively low MFE (around \u201320 kcal/mol) and is predicted to target more than one genotype of each virus. miRNAs of Ae. aegypti, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) genomes predicted by miRanda and TargetSpy. CHIKV belongs to the family of Togaviridae and the genus Alphavirus, with three genotypes circulating worldwide. miRanda and TargetSpy were used to identify a total of 20, 25, 26, and 22 miRNA binding sites that were commonly found for CHIKV of different genotypes and lineages. miRNAs that were sorted by the conservation of target sites that might show a more general miRNA-vRNA interaction. the most common in each virus group were listed in Supplementary Table S1. the highest number of shared binding sites was between ECSA and IOL genotypes (n = 18) and WA and Asian genotypes were relatively independent to each other with no common binding sites. miRNA binding sites in DENV Genomes DENV evolved independently into four serotypes from distinct sylvatic progenitors. they only share 60\u201375% sequence similarity and need to be analyzed separately to find potential miRNA-vRNA interactions. a total of 28, 30, 34, 33, and 26 potential binding sites were common to all five genotypes of DENV-1. the only miRNA found with a common binding site in genotypes I, III, IV, and V within NS4B is aae-miR-11-5p. two potential miRNA binding sites for aae-miR-263a-3p and aae-miR-998-3p were found conserved on the 3\u2032UTR of genotypes I, III, and V. DENV-3 Four genotypes of DENV-3 were selected for our analysis. aae-miR-124-3p, aae-miR-281-3p, and aae-miR-998-3p were predicted to target the NS4A, prM, and 3\u2032UTR regions. 4.7. DENV-4 Three potential miRNA binding sites were selected for our analysis. since the first human case reported in 1952, only 13 cases of mild, febrile illness were reported until the outbreak in the State of Yap (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007. cases of ZIKV related Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome were notified during the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013\u20132014. aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-286b-3p, aae-miR-34-3p, and aae-miR-new8 were common among all three genotypes. aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-286b-3p, and aae-miR-34-3p were predicted to target the 5\u2032 or 3 miR-11-5p, aar-miR-278-3p, aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-286a-3p, aae-miR-316-5p, and aae-miR-34-3p could potentially target more than one genotype/lineage of each virus species with an MFE below \u201320 kcal/ miRanda and TargetSpy were chosen for analyzing mosquito potential miRNA-vRNA interactions. miRanda is one of the most extensively used miRNA target prediction tools. miRanda is one of the most extensively used miRNA target prediction tools. a more reliable miRNA-vRNA interaction was examined by comparing these results with the structure information predicted by RNAhybrid. despite the amount of false positive miRNA-target interactions predicted by several algorithms due to the nature of miRNA target recognition, other factors like MFE that affect miRNA-target interaction were applied for results sorting. aae-miR-316-5p is an ovary specific miRNA and could be deposited into embryos. most DENV genotypes were predicted to have a binding site for aae-miR-316-5p at the 5\u2032UTR region. but the effectiveness of aae-miR-316-5p might be reduced due to the relatively low expression level. a single effective miRNA-vRNA interaction in the viral genome is sufficient to regulate viral replication. more evidence is available on the role of virus replication regulated by direct miRNA-vRNA interactions. in mammals, more evidence is available on the role of virus replication regulated by direct miRNA-vRNA interactions. inhibitor studies should shed light on individual miRNA-vRNA interactions. mutagenic analysis of virus genomes is possible for many arboviruses investigated here."}
