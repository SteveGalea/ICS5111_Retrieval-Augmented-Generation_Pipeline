{"summary": "in 2011, an estimated 13.7 million americans had been diagnosed with COPD. the disease led to 10.3 million office visits, 1.5 million emergency department visits, and 699,000 hospitalizations in 2010. approximately $50 billion was spent in 2010, including $20 billion in indirect costs and $30 billion in direct health care costs. exacerbations become more frequent and severe as COPD severity increases. it is estimated that patients with moderate COPD experience an average of 1.3 exacerbations per year. those with severe COPD experience an average of two exacerbations per year. hospitalized exacerbation Severe airflow limitation More severe depression and poorer cognition Greater inflammation Bacterial colonization of lower airways Presence of system disease/comorbidities Radiological evidence of emphysema Increased pulmonary artery diameter Prior history of asthma. goals of therapy include prevention of hospitalization or reduction in length of hospital stay, prevention of acute respiratory failure and mortality, resolution of exacerbation symptoms. ator therapy is considered to be one of the cornerstones of treating COPD exacerbation. inhaled antimuscarinic agents and beta2 agonists are often used in combination on either a scheduled and/or as-needed basis for symptom management. beta2 agonists\u2019 onset of action is faster than antimuscarinics with a marginally shorter duration of action. methylxanthines are considered second-line therapy for AECOPD management due to significant side effects and a narrow therapeutic window. corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids (sCS) have been shown to improve symptoms and lung function (FEV1), reduce risk of treatment failure and relapse, and reduce the length of hospitalization. investigators found that a five-day course of prednisone 40 mg daily was noninferior to a 14-day course with respect to re-exacerbation within six months. the optimal corticosteroid regimen in hospitalized patients may be a low-dose, short course of oral prednisone 40 mg per day for five days. the body of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of sCS among critically ill patients with AECOPD on mechanical ventilation study investigators compared open-label use of prednisone 1 mg/kg per day for a maximum of 10 days or usual care. primary endpoint was ICU mortality, and secondary endpoints were days on ventilator support and ICU length of stay. study included 11,083 (64%) in the high-dose group and 6,156 (36%) in the low-dose group. the lower dose was associated with a decrease in hospital LOS (P = 0.01), ICU LOS (P 0.01), hospital costs (P = 0.01), length of invasive ventilation (P = 0.01), insulin therapy (22.7% in the low-dose group versus 25.1% in the high-dose group; P 0.01), and fungal infections ( oral sCS should be used in the inpatient management of AECOPD. nebulized corticosteroids have minimal bioavailability, absorption, and systemic adverse effects. only a few nonblinded studies have examined nebulized corticosteroids. anthonisen criteria of increased sputum purulence and at least one of the following: increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume.1,26 Employment of this classification to initiate therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbations is largely based on a systematic review by Ram et al. procalcitonin is used as a marker of sepsis due to bacteria. it can be used to identify exacerbations caused by such pathogens. antibiotic use in patients with procalcitonin levels up to 0.1 mcg/L was discouraged. common bacterial pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. moderately to severely ill patients may be divided into uncomplicated and complicated exacerbations based on certain parameters to help guide therapy. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, or cefepime should be initiated empirically. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, or cefepime should be initiated empirically. patients who received antibiotics for the first or second exacerbation had a longer median time to subsequent exacerbations by 97 and 113 days. early antibiotic administration has been associated with improved outcomes in hospitalized patients. beta2 agonists provide benefits similar to antimuscarinic agents. but optimal doses for AECOPD have yet to be established. methylxanthines are considered second-line therapy for AECOPD management. corticosteroids improve symptoms and lung function (FEV1), reduce risk of treatment failure and relapse, and reduce the length of hospitalization. lower-dose corticosteroids and shorter treatment duration are associated with a lower incidence of treatment failures and a lower rate of side effects. almost all studies have excluded patients requiring mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) admission for AECOPD. but extrapolation of data from non-ICU AECOPD has led to sCS use in critically ill patients with AECOPD. sCS use in critically ill patients with AECOPD is scant. a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lower versus higher doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with AECOPD. the results suggest that prednisone did not exhibit a reduction in ICU mortality rate or patient-centered outcomes. study did not ascertain the optimal dose, route of administration, or duration of sCS therapy in critically ill patients. results from these trials are noteworthy and offer some insight into steroid treatment for critically ill patients. none of the guidelines or systematic reviews provide guidance on dosing and duration of sCS therapy in critically ill patients. investigators compared 4 mg to 8 mg of nebulized budesonide with various doses of oral or IV prednisolone. results showed no difference between the groups, and interpretation was hindered by small sample sizes, heterogeneous populations, and exclusion of severe exacerbation. purulent sputum resulted in positive bacterial cultures in 84% of patients, compared with 38% of those producing mucoid sputum (P 0.0001). sensitivity and specificity for reported sputum color were 73% and 39% respectively, compared to 90% and 52% in assessed sputum. 0.1 and 0.25 mcg/L indicated a possible bacterial infection. no difference in clinical success, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS. procalcitonin has also been studied in assessing treatment response. patients with uncomplicated exacerbations include those younger than 65 years of age with FEV1 more than 50% of predicted who experience fewer than three exacerbations per year. these patients may be treated with an advanced macrolide or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin. levofloxacin, levofloxacin, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, or cefepime should be initiated empirically and sputum cultures should be obtained. patients with recent exposure to antibiotics should be initiated on an agent of a different class for the treatment of exacerbation. STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING AECOPD Medications have not been shown consistently to modify the underlying pulmonary architecture or reverse airway destruction. the goals of comprehensive disease management include alleviating acute symptoms and reducing the severity and frequency of exacerbations. most recent ACCP/CTS guidelines suggest PPSV23 be administered to all COPD patients as part of disease management. evidence from clinical trials does not suggest vaccination to reduce exacerbations of disease. smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention for altering the progressive decline in lung function that is characteristic of this disease. the frequency with which this therapy should be provided is not specified in current clinical guidelines. most programs meet three times a week for at least six weeks after the acute-care hospitalization. there may be heterogeneity among rehabilitation programs and centers. the most recent ACCP/CTS guidelines suggest that PPSV23 be administered to all COPD patients as part of disease management. evidence from clinical trials does not suggest vaccination to reduce exacerbations of disease. smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention for altering the progressive decline in lung function. current guidelines suggest that pulmonary rehabilitation may have particular benefit for individuals with moderate, severe, or very severe COPD who have had an exacerbation of disease requiring hospitalization within the previous four weeks. the frequency with which this therapy should be provided is not specified in current clinical guidelines, and there may be heterogeneity among rehabilitation programs and centers. a systematic review encompassing seven clinical trials and 12,223 participants with COPD designed to compare the effects of tiotropium to LABAs. tiotropium use was associated with a reduction in the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations compared with use of a LABA. no statistical difference in mortality was observed between the treatment groups. anti-inflammatory effects of systemically administered corticosteroids may be beneficial not only in alleviating acute shortness of breath and reversing broncho-constriction when an asthmatic component exists. long-term use (beyond 30 days) has not been demonstrated to have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction. ICS should only be used in conjunction with long-acting bronchodilator therapy. researchers found azithromycin use to be associated with a significant reduction in exacerbations of COPD. current guidelines suggest use of long-term macrolide therapy for patients with one or more moderate-to-severe exacerbations of disease in the previous year. tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations compared with use of a LABA. tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the number of COPD exacerbations leading to hospitalization compared with LABA treatment. tic component exists, but may also reduce exacerbations of disease in a 30-day window following an initial exacerbation. long-term use (beyond 30 days) has not been demonstrated to have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction. current guidelines suggest use of long-term macrolide therapy for patients with one or more moderate-to-severe exacerbations of disease in the previous year. current guidelines suggest use of long-term macrolide therapy for patients with one or more moderate-to-severe exacerbations of disease in the previous year."}
