{"summary": "interferon kingdom interferons (IFNs)3 represent a group of cytokines that are able to induce resistance to virus infections in treated cells. most vertebrates possess three types (or families) of IFNs based on similarities in gene and protein sequences and structures, receptor utilization, and biological functions. all IFNs and IL-10-related cytokines signal through receptors belonging to the same class II cytokine receptor family (5, 7) divergence into two IFN families is likely to have happened relatively early in the tetrapod evolution. amphibians, reptiles (including birds) and mammals have distinctive type I and type III IFNs. phylogenetic tree for IFN-s with other IFNs and IL-10-related cytokines. only one IFN- was used in this alignment because the 13 human IFN- subtypes have nearly identical sequences. the type III IFN family in humans consists of four functional IFN- proteins. IFN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3, also designated as IL-28/29, were discovered in 2002/2003 by two independent groups (10, 11), and it shares 30% identity with other IFN-s. all type I IFNs signal through the IFNAR complex composed of IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 subunits. there is a poxvirus-encoded IFN antagonist that neutralizes the action of all human type I and type III IFNs. this viral glycoprotein neutralizes the action of all human type I and type III IFNs, with the exception of IFN-4 (15). IFN-s and type I IFNs use distinct heterodimeric receptor complexes. the IFN-s engage the unique IFN-R1 and IL-10R2 receptor complexes. the main STATs that become recruited and activated are STAT1 and STAT2, although activation of STAT3 and STAT5 can be detected (10, 19, 97) USP18 binds to the IFN-R2 intracellular domain, displaces JAK1 and suppresses IFN- signaling. the action of USP18 is of particular interest, because it provides a mechanism for selective inhibition and cross-regulation of type I and type III IFN-induced signaling. IRF-, NF-B-, and AP1-binding sites are commonly present in the promoters of both type I and type III IFN genes (16, 30, 31) the presence of regulatory elements led to the initial characterization of IFN-s as antiviral cytokines (11) IFN-s can be induced to substantial levels by either IRF or NF-B pathways (49\u201351), whereas type I IFN production requires activation of both pathways. a mechanism favoring IFN- production by epithelial cells is the increased number of peroxisomes found in polarized cells at mucosal surfaces. IFN production in the intestine is induced by invading bacterial and viral pathogens. these stimuli trigger predominantly IFN- expression from epithelial cells. the antiviral protection of IECs relies on the IFN--based autocrine system. the extent to which type I IFN expression is potentiated by IFN-s is less clear. immune cells are thought to be the major source of type I IFN production in vivo. priming by IFN-s is unlikely to affect type I IFN expression. the presence of an allele encoding fully active IFN-4 is strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes from HCV infection. the principle underlying this seeming contradiction remain elusive. mice infected with acute versus persistent strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are not responsive to type III IFNs in vivo. hepatocytes are sensitive to type III IFNs in vivo, despite their ability to respond to these cytokines ex vivo (69) intestinal epithelial cells respond almost exclusively to type III IFNs. type I IFNs are mostly active on immune and endothelial cells. this difference is observed only in adult animals. rotavirus and reovirus replicated in hematopoietic cells, where IFN- is inactive. indirect action of IFN-s was proposed for controlling persistent MNV infection. depletion of microbiota by antibiotics prevented establishment of persistent infection in mice infected with low MNV doses. influenza A virus infection induces the same set of ISGs in tracheal epithelial cells obtained from either wild-type, IFNAR-, or IFNLR-deficient mice. Enhanced respiratory syncytial virus replication is present only in mice deficient in both type I and type III IFN receptors. neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood do not respond to this cytokine, whereas neutrophils isolated from bone marrow are very sensitive to IFN-s (91) plasmacytoid dendritic cells isolated from human subjects are also responsive to both IFN types (43, 92) studies of IFN- treatment of influenza A virus-infected mice have shown similar results. exogenous IFN- was also able to prevent or cure murine norovirus infection (77) and reduce replication of rotavirus (35, 41, 76) as our understanding of these complementary systems grows, so will opportunities for nuanced therapeutic interventions in infectious and inflammatory disease."}
