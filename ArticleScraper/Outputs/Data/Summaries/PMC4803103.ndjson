{"summary": "CAP was defined as a newly recognized or worsening pulmonary infiltrate. of the 259 patients, 14 (5.4%) had PO-CAP, defined as the radiographic appearance of a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. nasopharyngeal swabs to detect 15 respiratory viruses (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah); urine assay for Legionella and Pneumococcus antigens (BinaxNOW, Alere, San Diego, California); and serum procalcitonin (PCT) >5% weight loss 19/28 (67.9) 16/49 (32.7).003 Cough 24 (80.0) 56 (93.3) 48 (80.0).009 Dyspnea 20 (66.7) 51 (85.0).045 Pleuritic chest pain 5 (16.7) 13 (21.7) ICU admission 2 (6.7) 11 (18.3).24 30-d mortality 12 (40.0) 7 (11.7) data are shown as No. (%) of patients and refer to values at the time of admission. sputum production; shortness of breath; pleuritic chest pain; confusion; crackles; leukocytosis. of the 259 patients, 14 (5.4%) had PO-CAP, defined as the radiographic appearance of a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. a level 0.1 ng/mL strongly opposes the presence of bacterial infection, a level 0.25 to 0.25 ng/mL suggests bacterial infection, and a level 0.5 favors bacterial infection. we also determined the time from initiation of antibiotics until defervescence. 029 Altered mental status 9 (30.0) 16 (26.7).74 Vital signs Temperature >37.4\u00b0C 10 (33.3) 34 (56.7).037 Vital signs Temperature >37.4\u00b0C 10 (33.3) 34 (56.7) data are shown as No. (%) of patients and refer to values at the time of admission, unless stated otherwise. the median duration of symptoms preceding admission was 14 days (range, 2\u201360 days) leukocytosis was present in 12 (40.0%) patients; only 1 had 3% band forms. Cavitation was detected radiographically in 5 cases (16.7%) PO-CAP was more commonly associated with a platelet count >300 000 cells/L (60.0% vs 26.7%; P =.002) a serum PCT level 0.25 ng/mL was more common with B-CAP (73.3% vs 33.0%; P.001). CAP severity, as assessed by PSI and CURB-65 or by the need for intensive care unit admission, was similar between groups. sputum culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in 1 patient each. sputum culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in 1 patient each. serum PCT levels were higher in B-CAP compared with PO-CAP. a serum PCT level 0.25 ng/mL was more common with B-CAP. defervescence by day 5 occurred more frequently in B-CAP than in PO-CAP. investigators concluded that an opacification distal to an obstructing tumor is caused by retained epithelial secretions. the term \"postobstructive pneumonia\" began to replace \"obstructive pneumonitis\" in the 1970s [18]. in more recent studies, ultrasound-guided aspiration of a cavity associated with a lung cancer yielded bacteria in one-third of cases. only reported presence of fever Liao, 2000 [9] Cavitating lung tumor 22 Culture of cavity aspirate Febrile: bacteria in 6 of 7 (86%). only reported presence of fever Ferretti, 2008 [10] Nonresolving focal pneumonia 20 Lung histopathology and culture Bacteria in 2 (10%) despite problems with sensitivity and specificity, this test has been widely recommended to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial infections. in nearly two-thirds of PO-CAP cases, PCT was 0.25 ng/mL, which is thought to oppose the diagnosis of bacterial infection. despite an intensive and systematic search for bacterial infection, only 3 (10%) PO-CAP patients had evidence of bacterial infection. patients with PO-CAP have greater chronicity of disease, manifested by longer duration of symptoms, greater weight loss, absence of symptoms of upper respiratory infection, lower WBC counts with fewer band forms, and higher platelet counts. patients with PO-CAP are less likely to have sputum production but more likely to have hemoptysis, fever, and a cavitary lesion on chest radiograph."}
