{"summary": "acute encephalomyelitis and immune-mediated demyelination were induced by intracranial injection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. cytolytic activity, cytokine activity, and expression of certain chemokine receptors were assessed at defined points post-infection. expression of the chemokine homing receptors analyzed on CD4+ cells was not affected. the severity of demyelination was similar at 14 days p.i. between WT and miR-155/ JHMV-infected mice."}
