{"summary": "rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers. it has a diverse etiology including infections, trauma, strenuous exercise, drug reactions, metabolic disorders, and status epilepticus. viral myositis was the most frequent cause, accounting for 38% (73/191) of cases. white blood cell count was 3.000/mcl, with 60% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes. his electrolytes were within normal limits; BUN was 13 mg/dL (normal 5\u201320), and creatinine was 0.44 mg/dL (normal 0.10\u20130.80); ALT was 105 U/L (normal 0\u201340). acute benign myositis and rhabdomyolysis are not a clear distinction in the literature between acute benign myositis and rhabdomyolysis. rhabdomyolysis means disintegration of striated muscle with resultant leakage of muscle cell constituents. myalgias involved predominantly the calves and thighs in all children. muscle weakness or difficulty in walking was reported in all the remaining cases and muscle swelling in 33% (2/6) a review of 39 children with influenza associated myositis/rhabdomyolysis, the median age was 8.5 years (range 2.5\u201314) none of the children with parainfluenza had dark urine, except for one who presented with the \u201cclassic triad\u201d of myalgias, muscle weakness, and dark urine. the median CPK level was 7,563 U/L (range 1,566\u201350,000, mean 15,508) compared with a median of 4,100 U/L (range 230\u20131,000,000) in 36 children with influenza. the need for renal replacement therapy did not correlate with the initial or peak level of CPK in another series of 28 children [14]. cornavirus were detected by electron microscopy in an adult with hemorrhagic pneumoniae. the pathogenesis of viral-induced rhabdomyolysis is unclear. it has been suggested that infection with parainfluenza leads to increased production of interferon-1. potential complications include acute renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, and compartment syndrome. the implementation of laboratory methods such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction assays may lead to enhanced recognition andcharacterization of rhabdomyolysis associated with parainfluenza."}
