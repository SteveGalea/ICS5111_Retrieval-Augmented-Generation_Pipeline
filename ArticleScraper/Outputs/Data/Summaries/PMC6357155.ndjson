{"summary": "the 21st century has seen the worldwide spread of two previously unrecognized coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both of which are highly pathogenic. a united global effort led to the rapid identification of the SARS coronavirus and remarkable scientific advancements in epidemic prevention. in may 2015, an outbreak of MERS occurred in south Korea due to an individual returning from the Middle East [10]. advances have allowed for rapid and systemic progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these viruses. more than 80% of recent research into the virology and genetics of this infection indicated that bats could be the possible natural reservoirs of both SARS and MERS-CoV. dromedary camels and palm civets are also possible intermediary hosts of SARS and MERS, respectively, before dissemination to humans. the transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has yet to be understood. recent reports demonstrated that camel workers in Saudi Arabia with high prevalence of MERS-CoV may contribute to the transmission of MERS. human-to-human spread has also been detected, especially through nosocomial transmission. ARS-CoV MERS-CoV Length of nucleotides 29,727 30,119 Open reading frames (ORFs) 11 11 Structural protein 4 4 Spike protein (length of amino acids) 1255 1353 S1 subunit Receptor-binding domain (RBD) 318\u2013510 367\u2013588 Receptor-binding motif (RBM) 424\u2013494 484\u2013567 S2 subunit Heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain the viral membrane contains S, E, and M proteins. the spike protein plays a vital functional role in viral entry. the rep gene encodes the non-structural protein and constitutes approximately two-thirds of the genome at the 5\u2032 end. the genome has 29,727 nucleotides in length, including 11 open reading frames (ORFs) the SARS-CoV rep gene encodes at least two polyproteins (encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b) the virus is significantly different from previously reported coronaviruses. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV possess five and eight accessory proteins. differences might lead to greater sensitivity to the effects of induction and signaling of type 1 interferons in MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV. virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis. ACE2 is widely expressed on the epithelial cells of alveoli, trachea, bronchi, bronchial serous glands and alveolar monocytes and macrophages. atypical pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration and failure can be induced by SARS-CoV infection because of increased levels of activated proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. the primary receptor is a multifunctional cell surface protein, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (CD26) [36], widely expressed on epithelial cells in the kidney, alveoli, small intestine, liver, and prostate. MERS-CoV may deregulate antiviral T-cell responses due to stimulation of apoptosis. this virus might also lead to immune dysregulation by stimulating attenuated immune responses. two residues in the RBM at positions 479 and 487 determine the progression of the SARS disease and the tropism of SARS-CoV. the S2 subunit mediates the fusion between SARS-CoV and target cells, and includes the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 domains, whose HR1 region is longer than the HR2 region. the residues 484\u2013567 of RBM take charge of interacting with the extracellular -propeller domain of DPP4. the fusion core formation of MERS-CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV; however, it is different from that of other coronaviruses, such as the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) a six-helix bundle fusion core structure is made up by the HR1 and HR2 domains for bringing the viral envelope and the target cell membrane into close proximity and contributing to fusion. a fusion core structure is made up by the HR1 and HR2 domains for bringing the viral envelope and the target cell membrane into close proximity and contributing to fusion. whole virus with or without adjuvant (promote an effective immune response against the inactivated pathogen) [91,95] Maintained virus particles structure; rapidly develop; easy to prepare; safety; high-titer neutralizing antibodies [93,97] possible TH2 cell-distortive immune response [98,99] high safety; consistent production; can induce cellular and humoral immune responses; high-titer neutralizing antibodies. high safety; relatively lower immunogenicity; need appropriate adjuvants [77]. ated, modified vaccine virus, Ankara, encoding full-length S protein. but full-length S protein-based vaccines may induce harmful immune responses. there are still no commercial vaccines available against MERS-CoV. s expressing the MERS-CoV gene produced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice [89]. in the absence of clinically proven, effective antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients mainly receive supportive care supplemented by diverse combinations of drugs. several approaches are being considered to treat infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. off-label use in patients (often in combination with corticosteroids) [146,147] Effective in a non-human primate model; off-label use in patients (often in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and oxygen) [10,148] Common Feature None of these therapeutic agents are approved for commercial use in humans The vital role of the S protein of SARS-CoV makes this protein an important therapeutic target. human immunoglobulin transgenic mice immunized with full-length SARS-CoV S proteins [125,126,127]. 80R and CR3014 binding to the ACE2 receptor are examples of S-specific mAbs [128,129]. Similarly, the therapeutic agents that have been developed against MERS-CoV are based on the S protein and restrain the binding of receptors or the fusion of membrane proteins. the entire receptor-binding loop (amino acids 424\u2013494) is located on the RBD and is responsible for complete contact with ACE2. two residues in the RBM at positions 479 and 487 determine the progression of the SARS disease and the tropism of SARS-CoV. two N-linked glycans, N410 and N487, are seated in the core and RBM. the residues 484\u2013567 of RBM take charge of interacting with the extracellular -propeller domain of DPP4. the fusion core formation of MERS-CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV. BD in the S1 subunit to the receptor ACE2 stimulates a conformational change in S2. the supposed fusion peptide (amino acids 770\u2013788) builds in the target cell membrane of the host. a six-helix bundle fusion core structure is made up by the HR1 and HR2 domains. virus particles are inactivated by heat, chemicals, or radiation Whole virus, with or without adjuvant. virus particles are inactivated by heat, chemicals, or radiation Whole virus, with or without adjuvant (promote an effective immune response against the inactivated pathogen) the S protein is the principal antigenic component that induces antibodies to block virus-binding, stimulate host immune responses, fuse or neutralize antibodies. the vaccine could protect monkeys from subsequent homologous SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating highly effective immunization with the S protein. full-length S protein-based vaccines may induce harmful immune responses, causing liver damage in the vaccinated animals or enhancing infection after being challenged with homologous SARS-CoV. there are still no commercial vaccines available against the full-length S protein. 4 T cells should be considered as an essential part of any HCoV vaccine strategy. these CD4 T cells target a conserved epitope within the N protein that cross-reacts with several other CoVs. despite extensive research reporting on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it was not possible to establish whether treatments benefited patients during their outbreak. peptides that block RBD\u2013ACE2-binding derived from both RBD [114] and ACE2 [76] could be developed as novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV infection. anti-SARS-CoV peptides blocking the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction by forming a fusion-active core have viral fusion inhibitory activity at the micromolar level. a series of neutralizing human mAbs were generated from the B cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV [123,124]. another strategy used human immunoglobulin transgenic mice immunized with full-length SARS-CoV S proteins [125,126,127]. 80R and CR3014 binding to the ACE2 receptor are examples of S-specific mAbs [128,129]. mouse models of SARS-CoV replication have been studied in mice, hamsters, civet cats, and non-human primates. more severe pathological lesions and increased mortality were observed in one-year-old animals. titer of virus replication in the lungs of the lower respiratory tract was highly reproducible without any signs of morbidity or mortality. on day 2\u20133 post-infection, virus replication in the respiratory tract peaked but was not accompanied by massive pulmonary inflammation or pneumonitis. ferrets were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [171] but could transmit the virus at low levels by direct contact [84,172,173,174] ferrets could develop fever, which is a characteristic clinical symptom of SARS-CoV-infected patients. mice [187,188], ferrets [134], guinea pigs [189] and hamsters [189] are not susceptible to experimental MERS-CoV infection mainly because their homologous DPP4 molecules do not function as receptors for MERS-CoV entry. despite this, MERS-CoV is a broad host-range virus in vitro [25]. a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain (MERSMA) was produced in the lungs of hDPP4-KI mice after 30 serial passages, causing effective weight loss and mortality in this mouse model. this mouse model also showed clinical symptoms of interstitial pneumonia, including inflammatory cell infiltration, thickened alveolar and mild edema [195]. however, there are limitations to this model, such as the uncontrolled expression and distribution of hDPP4. non-Human Primates NHPs, such as the rhesus macaques [201] and common marmosets [202], are useful models for studying the pathogenesis of mild MERS-CoV infection. rhesus macaques caused transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques, with associated pneumonia. mouse models include BALB/c [149,150], C57BL6 (B6) [151] and 129SvEv-lineage mice. most relevant transgenic and knockout lines are accessible based on these susceptible animals. young mice require more mutations and passages than aged mice. viremia is common and long-lasting in patients, while it is rare and transient in mouse models [161]. viremia could therefore be used as a stable and reproducible animal model for the evaluation of vaccines, immune-prophylaxis, and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV [81,96,109,124,149,162,163,164,165,166]. at least six species of non-human primates were evaluated as animal models for SARS. at least six NHP species were tested including three old world monkeys. rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and three new world monkeys were tested. young mice require more mutations and passages than aged mice to produce SARS-CoV mouse-adapted strains. more severe pathological lesions and increased mortality were observed in one-year-old animals. hamster model is ideal for studies on immunoprophylaxis and treatment of SARS. but there are still limited resources in terms of genetically established animal lines. ferrets were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [171] but could transmit the virus at low levels by direct contact. rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and africa green monkeys facilitated the replication of SARS-CoV [186]. Virus replication was detected in the respiratory tract of rhesus macaques. despite this, MERS-CoV is a broad host-range virus in vitro. there is hope that a reproducible and stable animal model for human MERS-CoV infection can be improved in the near future. mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain (MERSMA) including 13\u201322 mutations was produced in the lungs of hDPP4-KI mice after 30 serial passages. both this hDPP4-KI mouse and the MERSMA strain provide better tools to explore the pathogenesis of MERS and potential novel treatments. the first mouse model of MERS infection reported in 2014 involved transducing animals with recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding human DPP4 molecules intranasally. this resulted in replication of MERS-CoV in the lungs. however, there are limitations to this model, such as the uncontrolled expression and distribution of hDPP4. hDPP4-KI mouse and the MERSMA strain provide better tools to explore the pathogenesis of MERS and potential novel therapies. dromedary camels showed mild upper respiratory infections after the administration of MERS-CoV [198], causing effective weight loss and mortality in this mouse model. one study indicated that the infection became progressive severe pneumonia [203], while other groups found that MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets only developed mild to moderate nonlethal respiratory diseases by intratracheal administration [206]. the interaction between the host receptor and functional proteins of SARS and MERS plays an important and predominant role. further evidence demonstrates that the host restriction of MERS-CoV remarkably depends on the sequence of DPP4, such as the characterization of amino acid residues at the connector of DPP4 with the RBD of S proteins in mice [187,210], hamsters, and cotton rats [210]. however, the multiplicity in severity of disease between rhesus macaques and common marmosets indicate that other host factors can perhaps affect the infection and replication of the virus. the development of stable and reproducible animal models of MERS is a decisive step forward. the next step in the development of standardized and controllable therapies against SARS and MERS will be clinical trials in humans, validating a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and accruing data in real time during future outbreaks."}
