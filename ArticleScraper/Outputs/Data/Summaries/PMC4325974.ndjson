{"summary": "herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can be recurrent and difficult to treat in HIV coinfected individuals. complications of HHV infections remain among the most common medical problems in people infected with HIV worldwide [3\u20137] NFV does not inhibit HHV replication by acting on the viral protease. we hypothesize that NFV acting on a nonprotease viral target would be improbable. NFV acting on a nonprotease viral target would be more likely due to one or more of its effects on host cells. IDV and acyclovir (Sigma-Aldrich) were solubilized in water. primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-HSV gB (Virusys), mouse monoclonal anti-HSV1 gC clone 3G9 (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-actin, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal, and anti-HA membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.3% Tween-20 (TBS-T), incubated with 1-2 g lectin/mL in blocking buffer for 1-2 hours. blots were washed three times in TBS-T following avidin incubation. the protease coding sequence contained an N-terminal HA tag. each substrate contained an N-terminal FLAG tag; all vectors were synthesized by blue Heron Biotech, LLC. each substrate was expressed alone or in combination with the protease. the inoculum was replaced with medium containing 0.1% DMSO or 10 M NFV. at 16 or 20 hpi the medium was replaced with a 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM and 1/2 Karnovsky's fixative. the cells were incubated a further 30\u201360 minutes at room temperature. the nuclei were stained with TO-PRO 3. Slides were mounted after addition of SlowFade. confocal images were generated on an LSM 5 Pascal system (Zeiss) peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L) or peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L) secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were AlexaFluor 594 F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L) selection of Resistance HF were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and then incubated at 37\u00b0C with either 5 M NFV, 1 M ACV, or no drug for 3\u20135 days. the effect of NFV on HSV-1 maturational protease activity was assayed by transfecting HEK293-T cells. NFV (10 M final concentration) or DMSO (0.1% final concentration) was added to the cells concurrently with the DNA and transfection reagent. cells were incubated 24 hours with no change of medium. extracted proteins (10 g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE. the grids were examined on a JEOL 1230 or a JEOL JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope at the Electron Microscopy Lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. they were seeded in 4-well chamber slides to a confluence of approximately 70%. they were mock-infected or infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 3. NFV inhibits production of infectious HSV-1 through a mechanism distinct from that of acyclovir and does not readily select for antiviral resistance in vitro. NFV does not inhibit activity of the HSV-1 protease. construct expression and substrate cleavage were evaluated by Western blot using anti-HA and FLAG antibodies. each protein expressed alone was of the expected size (28.8, 37.9, and 70.6 kD, resp., including tag) each protein expressed alone was of the expected size (28.8, 37.9, and 70.6 kD, resp., including tag) decreased Akt activation does not account for the ability of NFV to inhibit HSV-1 viral replication. HSV-1 infection of vero cells resulted in an increase in levels of phosphorylated (p)-Akt at 2 hours compared to uninfected cells. NFV treatment impairs HSV-1 maturation and egress. white arrows indicate HSV-1 capsids in the nucleus (N), black arrowheads indicate capsids in the cytoplasm (C) and black arrows indicate extracellular (E) virions. plasm of NFV-treated cells were almost exclusively nonenveloped. NFV treatment staining appeared predominantly perinuclear. NFV treatment staining appeared predominantly perinuclear. fluorescence, no increase in LC3-II staining, a marker of autophagy, was apparent. NFV affects the glycosylation and subcellular localization of viral gene products. blots show increased mobility in gB and gC with NFV treatment. NFV does not inhibit the activity of the HSV-1 protease on its scaffold protein substrates. NFV does not inhibit activity of the HSV-1 protease. construct expression and substrate cleavage were evaluated by Western blot. each protein expressed alone was of the expected size (28.8, 37.9, and 70.6 kD, resp., including tag) each protein expressed alone was of the expected size (28.8, 37.9, and 70.6 kD, resp., including tag) NFV inhibitor LY294002 could completely suppress Akt phosphorylation in HSV-1 infected cells. but NFV did not substantially reduce levels of p-Akt even at drugs concentrations that potently block virus production. we therefore explored the effects of NFV on HSV-1 infected HF cells. NFV treatment impairs HSV-1 maturation and egress. white arrows indicate HSV-1 capsids in the nucleus (N), black arrowheads indicate capsids in the cytoplasm (C) and black arrows indicate extracellular (E) virions. NFV treatment of infected cells resulted in increased electrophoretic mobility. the apparent change in molecular weight of these viral proteins was estimated to be consistent with the reduction in glycosylation in HSV-1-infected cells. NFV resulted in a marked reduction in staining by PNA, RCA-I, and WGA. ts of NFV-treated HF cells show increased mobility in gB and gC. altered staining by lectins shows reduced overall glycosylation in NFV-treated cells. NFV acts on HSV-1 late in virus production, without a detectable effect on late viral gene expression. no resistance to NFV could be selected under conditions that readily resulted in acyclovir-resistant HSV-1. NFV inhibits cellular proteases and the proteasome, which leads to accumulation and inefficient removal of misfolded proteins in the ER and Golgi. n-acetylglucosamine-lipid intermediates and other inhibitors of protein glycosylation decrease infectious yield of HSV-1 in vitro. tunicamycin does not affect level of late viral gene product expression. it is unclear whether impaired HSV-1 envelope protein glycosylation would block virus egress based on studies using cell lines deficient in N-acetylglucosamine activity. autophagy can be difficult to demonstrate and cannot be excluded as a potential contributor to the effect of NFV on HSV-1 or other HHVs. NFV is an orally bioavailable, FDA-approved treatment for HIV infection and is well tolerated during long-term use."}
