{"summary": "method Gastrointestinal endoscopes after reprocessing were selected randomly at the gastrointestinal endoscopy center of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai from October 2018 to February 2019. the endoscopes selected were all sampled in three different methods under continuous sampling and intermittent sampling respectively. results A total of 12 endoscopes were sampled by using continuous sampling approach. endoscopes after reprocessing, including gastroendoscope, intestinal endoscope, duodenal endoscope, ultrasound endoscope, etc. the quality of the gastrointestinal endoscopic reprocessing is not stable, and scientific and objective monitoring is urgently needed. the APIC recommends sampling the suction and biopsy channel and the air-water channel in a flushing method. a-GENCA recommends to sample the entire channel of endoscopes with the sequence of flush-brush-flush method in both antegrade and retrograde manner. the UMCG suggests the sampling by retrograde rinsing of endoscopic suction biopsy and air-water channel. in order to improve the detection rate of endoscopic microbial contamination after reprocessing, the Ministry of Health of China has issued the national standard for endoscope cleaning and disinfection since 2004. hospital in Shanghai included 10 gastroscopes (Olympus, Japan), 2 colonoscopes (Olympus, Japan), and 24 disc brushes (Normandie Endo Technologies, France, general type) the neutralizer is an aldehyde neutralization enrichment medium (Haibo Biotechnology, China), and is an aldehyde neutralization enrichment medium. a sterile film was placed onto the air/water port, suction, and instrument port of the endoscopic control section. the neutralizer was injected and flushed through the endoscope channel from the suction port beside the endoscope light guiding connector, through the suction and biopsy channel. the total volume of elution was collected from the distal end of the endoscope. Figure 3. Flush the instrument and suction channel from the control section (Group A) Figure 3. Brush-flush the instrument channel from the instrument port (Group C) a total of 12 gastrointestinal endoscopes were randomly selected from October 2018 to February 2019 from the gastrointestinal endoscopy center of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai. the results were confirmed as negative if the number of bacterial colonies in the culture results was 1 CFU/piece. the entire operating procedure followed the principle of aseptic technique. a peristaltic pump was used and an injection needle was repeatedly injected for 2-3 times for full amount collection. a sterile film was placed onto the air/water port, suction port, and instrument port of the endoscopic control section. a disposable disc brush was inserted into the instrument port and the instrument channel was brushed until the brush end completely exited the instrument channel outlet. the upper part of the brush was cut off (2 cm) using sterile scissors, then the clipped brush was put into a sterile bottle for testing. the eluate was thoroughly mixed with the brush inside the sterile bottle. the endoscopes after reprocessed were sampled as below: 50 ml of the neutralizer was extracted with a sterile syringe, injected, and flushed the instrument channel through the biopsy port of the control section. the total volume of elution was collected from the distal end of the endoscope. the eluate was thoroughly mixed and sent to the laboratory of Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 2 hours. a blunt head of a sterile disposable disc brush was inserted into the instrument port. the instrument channel was brushed until the brush end completely exited the instrument channel outlet of the distal end. the upper part of the brush was cut off (2 cm) using sterile scissors, then the clipped brush was put into a sterile bottle for testing. ent agar medium cooled to 40\u00b0C\u201345\u00b0C was poured into each plate. inoculate filtered membrane was placed on a solidified nutrient agar plate. the remaining eluate (48 ml) was filtered under sterile conditions using a filter membrane. the detection rate of bacteria for either the disc brush group or the entire channel group was higher than the biopsy channel group. it showed that the detection rate of bacteria for either the disc brush group or the entire channel group was higher than the biopsy channel group. microbiology culture is the gold standard for quality control of endoscope cleaning and disinfection. it is an important minimal invasive diagnosis and treatment method for gastrointestinal tract, pancreaticobiliary, and other diseases. it has complex and delicate structure and is difficult to thoroughly reprocess. different sampling methods will lead to the difference of microbiological culture results. false negative results will affect the reliability of the microbiology culture result. scientific and practical microbiological sampling methods are critical to ensure the quality of flexible endoscope reprocessing. the conventional sampling method has been applied in china for nearly 15 years since 2004. but the lack of well-defined operational procedures for specific sampling methods is likely to result in denormalization of microbiological sampling and reduced evaluability of results. a prospective study of the disinfection effect of a duodenoscope found that the positive rate for the treated duodenoscope was 5\u201315.5% [10] Riberiro et al. from Brazil sampled the high-level disinfected endoscopes from 37 healthcare institutions in Minas Gerais. the contamination rate of air-water channel of gastroscope was as high as 70% [13\u201315]. disc brush sampling method could scrub the endoscope channel and remove new and old contaminants from endoscope channel. the entire channel sampling method is more comprehensive, avoiding the limitations of the other two methods. the disc brush sampling method could fully scrub the inner wall of the lumen, loosening and washing off the attachments. the disc brush sampling method has higher bacterial positive detection rate than the conventional biopsy channel sampling method. this study is a single-center study. however, the samples we used came from the gastrointestinal endoscopes used in daily clinical practice."}
