{"summary": "restriction enzymes were first identified and characterized on the basis of their ability to cleave bacteriophage DNA. SV40 was discovered in tissue cultures of monkey kidney cells in which poliovirus vaccine was produced. it was hoped detailed analysis of tumor viruses would shed light on the genesis of common human cancers. X174 and SV40 are relatively simple viruses, each with only about 5,000 DNA base pairs. papillomaviruses, the cause of warts and cervical and some other human cancer, with 8,000 base pairs, in 1982. adenoviruses, which cause respiratory tract disease in humans and tumors in experimental animals, with 36,000 base pairs, in 1984. the poxviruses, a virus group that includes the dreaded smallpox virus, weighed in at 191,636 base pairs in 1990. the first sequences were derived from RNA copied from the viral DNA, but soon moved to sequencing the DNA itself. a key breakthrough was the development of rapid enzymatic DNA sequencing methods by Sanger and colleagues at Cambridge University. hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus are responsible for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, the third most common cancer in the world [14,15] study of oncogenic retroviruses from animal tumors revealed that these viruses carried genes responsible for cancer and that these genes were actually altered versions of cellular oncogenes. ongoing work at Yale and elsewhere demonstrates that viral gene expression is required to maintain the survival and growth of certain cancers. Vaccination against viral non-structural antigens expressed by cancer cells also has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach. sequencing of archived samples of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus allowed the resurrection of this virus. the first complete DNA sequence of a bacterial genome, that of Mycoplasma genitalium, was reported in 1995 [35], and now hundreds of bacterial genomes have been decoded. the genomes of several other pathogens and organisms useful as experimental models, including the malaria parasite, insects, worms, plants, and other mammals, have been sequenced. sequencing of the cellular versions of the oncogenes first identified in tumor viruses revealed newly arising mutations in many sporadically occurring human cancers. many of these oncogenes encode growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transduction proteins, and transcription factors, which are crucial components of signaling pathways that determine how cells respond to their environment, grow, and die. the ability to decode bacterial and cellular genomes is a watershed achievement in biology. the ability to decode bacterial and cellular genomes is a watershed achievement in biology. this remarkable accomplishment is the logical extension of pioneering studies begun a quarter of a century earlier on viruses."}
