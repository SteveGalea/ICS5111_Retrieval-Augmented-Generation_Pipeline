{"summary": "human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are known to circulate in the human population. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses causing deadly pneumonia in humans. the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses is determined by the receptor-binding properties of the S protein. the protein encoded by WIV-1 binds human, bat, and civet ACE2 orthologues, allowing the virus to efficiently infect human cells expressing any of these orthologues. MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, the S glycoprotein is cleaved at the S1/S2 junction during biogenesis and viral egress (10\u201313) this proteolytic event, along with subsequent binding to the host receptor, enhances processing at the S2\u2032 site and participates in MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV fusion activation (11, 13). no porcine coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier to infect humans. cross-species transmission of coronaviruses poses an imminent and long-term threat to human health. the recently emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is responsible for diarrhea in piglets. PDCoV has evolved to be highly adapted to the protease-rich environment of the enteric tract to ensure proper spatial and temporal activation of fusion and prevent premature triggering, which would significantly impact virus infectivity. a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter operated in zero-loss mode and a Gatan K2 Summit electron-counting camera operated in super-resolution mode. we determined a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction at 3.5- resolution, resolving most amino acid side chains, disulfide bonds, and N-linked glycans. the PDCoV S protein assembles as a compact trimer with a height of 145 and a width of 115. the unsharpened PDCoV S map resolves 21 N-linked glycans for each protomer that form prominent protrusions extending from the protein surface. expressed in Drosophila S2 cells corresponded mostly to paucimannosidic glycans containing 3 mannose residues and oligomannose glycans containing 4 to 9 mannose residues. we also detected complex glycans (with or without core fucosylation) which appears compatible with accessibility and crowding of these carbohydrate chains that would permit processing. numerous glycans identified in the PDCoV-NL63 S structure overlap glycans in the HCoV-NL63 S protein, either strictly or topologically, with most differences toward the viral membrane-distal end of the molecule. there is considerable sequence divergence between the HCoV-NL63 and PDCoV S glycoproteins. PDCoV and HCoV-NL63, however, exhibit opposite behavior, as they target the enteric or the respiratory tract despite the absence or presence of a domain 0 in their S glycoproteins. we describe below the functionally relevant similarities and differences detected in the PDCoV S structure relative to other coronavirus S structures. the PDCoV S1 subunit C-terminally fused with the Fc portion of human IgG (S1-Fc) was tested for its hemagglutination potential. the sialic acid-binding S1 subunit of HCoV-OC43 (GenBank accession no. AAR01015.1) was used as a positive control. OC43, HKU1, and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are known to use 9-O-acetyl-sialylated cellular receptors for attachment to host cells. a nanoparticle-displayed multimeric PDCoV S1 subunit failed to interact with sialic acid using an erythrocyte hemagglutination assay. the two PDCoV S glycans identified at Asn-311 and Asn-331 in domain B are topologically or strictly conserved with the HCoV-NL63 S glycans linked to Asn-486 and Asn-512. the glycan linked to Asn-506 in HCoV-NL63 S is absent from PDCoV S, for which the equivalent residue is Ser-325. loops located at the viral membrane-distal end of the -sandwich of domain B in -coronavirus S glycoproteins are responsible for binding to diverse host receptors. the distal loops are significantly shorter for PDCoV than for these three -coronaviruses. a major difference is that -coronavirus S using domain B as a receptor-binding domain appears spontaneously. the PDCoV S2 subunit trimer is structurally similar to - and -coronavirus S2 subunits such as HCoV-NL63 (22) (RMSD, 1.7 over 413 aligned C positions) and MHV (21) (RMSD, 2.2 over 291 aligned C positions) coronavirus fusion machineries exhibit differences with key functional implications for their activation mechanism. a single positively charged residue (Arg-669) in addition to the conserved Arg-673 residue (Fig. 5A and B) these structural features allow rationalizing the known protease requirements for fusion activation of the HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein. the PDCoV S2\u2032 trigger loop is in line with the requirement for trypsin or other pancreatic proteases to allow virus passaging. studies on influenza hemagglutinin highlighted that glycans can modulate cleavage site accessibility to proteases and in turn influence fusion activation. similar observations were drawn from comparisons between the PDCoV and HKU4 S glycoproteins (14) this polypeptide segment is known to refold to form a central triple-helical coiled coil in the postfusion S structure (53). this region is disordered in the PDCoV S reconstruction and in all other coronavirus prefusion S structures. insertions directly interact within the 6-helix bundle (Fig. S2B) Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter operated in zero-loss mode and a Gatan K2 Summit electron-counting camera operated in super-resolution mode. we determined a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction at 3.5- resolution, resolving most amino acid side chains, disulfide bonds, and N-linked glycans. rotamers (%) 98.7 Poor rotamers (%) 0.35 Ramachandran allowed (%) 99.79 Ramachandran outliers (%) 0.21 Clash score 1.41 MolProbity score 1.1 The PDCoV S protein assembles as a compact trimer with a height of 145 and a width of 115. MS for PDCoV S expressed in Drosophila S2 cells corresponded mostly to paucimannosidic glycans containing 3 mannose residues and oligomannose glycans containing 4 to 9 mannose residues. we also detected complex glycans (with or without core fucosylation) which appears compatible with accessibility and crowding of these carbohydrate chains that would permit processing. numerous glycans identified in the PDCoV S structure overlap glycans in the HCoV-NL63 S protein, either strictly or topologically, with most differences toward the viral membrane-distal end of the molecule. transmission of zoonotic viruses into humans can result in drastic changes in glycosylation, as exemplified by the human influenza hemagglutinin. coV and HCoV-NL63 S1 subunits exhibit strikingly similar structures except for the absence of domain 0 in the former glycoprotein. PDCoV and HCoV-NL63, however, exhibit opposite behavior, as they target the enteric or the respiratory tract despite the absence or presence, respectively, of a domain 0 in their S glycoproteins. the PDCoV S1 subunit C-terminally fused with the Fc portion of human IgG (S1-Fc) was tested for its hemagglutination potential of an erythrocyte suspension of human or rat origin. the sialic acid-binding S1 subunit of HCoV-OC43 was used as a positive control. OC43, HKU1, and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are known to use 9-O-acetyl-sialylated cellular receptors for attachment to host cells. a nanoparticle-displayed multimeric PDCoV S1 subunit failed to interact with sialic acid using an erythrocyte hemagglutination assay. the two PDCoV S glycans identified at Asn-311 and Asn-331 in domain B are topologically or strictly conserved with the HCoV-NL63 S glycans linked to Asn-486 and Asn-512. the glycan linked to Asn-506 in HCoV-NL63 S is absent from PDCoV S, for which the equivalent residue is Ser-325. distal loops located at the viral membrane-distal end of the -sandwich of domain B in -coronavirus S glycoproteins are responsible for binding to diverse host receptors. loops are significantly shorter for PDCoV than for these three -coronaviruses. the PDCoV S2 subunit trimer is structurally similar to - and -coronavirus S2 subunits such as HCoV-NL63 (22) (RMSD, 1.7 over 413 aligned C positions) and MHV (21) (RMSD, 2.2 over 291 aligned C positions) coronavirus fusion machines exhibit differences with key functional implications for their activation mechanism and potential for zoonotic spillover. coV S2\u2032 loop harbors a single positively charged residue (Arg-669) in addition to the conserved Arg-673 residue (Fig. 5A and B) these structural features allow rationalizing the known protease requirements for fusion activation of the HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein, which is preferentially cleaved by furin in the endosomes, and of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. studies on influenza hemagglutinin highlighted that glycans can modulate cleavage site accessibility to proteases and in turn influence fusion activation. similar observations were drawn from comparisons between the PDCoV and HKU4 S glycoproteins (14) the polypeptide segment is known to refold to form a central triple-helical coiled coil in the postfusion S structure (53). this region is disordered in the PDCoV S reconstruction and in all other coronavirus prefusion S structures. insertions directly interact within the 6-helix bundle. - and -coronavirus S glycoproteins share closer evolutionary relationships. insertions in HR1 and HR2 also have been detected in a subset of -coronavirus S proteins. previously recapitulated in vitro proteolytic activation of MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV prefusion S trimers via trypsin incubation. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV are not expected to be exposed to pancreatic proteases during the virus life cycle. trypsin sensitivity could result in premature cleavage/triggering of the prefusion S trimer and attenuation of infectivity and viral fitness. a human codon-optimized gene encoding the ectodomain (residues 14 to 1180) of the SARS-CoV S protein (UniProt accession no. P59594) was cloned into a modified pOPING vector (61) (Addgene), introducing a C-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, a foldon, and a hexa clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 40-fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (10-kDa cutoff; Sartorius) and adjusted to pH 8.0 before affinity purification using a superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) the concentration of the purified protein was estimated using absorption at 280 nm. data were collected using serialEM automatic data collection software (62) on an FEI Titan Krios operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan GIF Quantum energy filter operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV. the dose rate was adjusted to 5 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in counting mode fractionated in 70 frames of 200 ms. UCSF Chimera (72) was used to fit the HCoV-NL63 S structure (22) into the cryo-EM map before manual rebuilding in Coot (32, 73). glycan density coming after an NXS/T motif was initially hand built into the density, where visible and glycan geometry then were refined using Rosetta. for each sample, 8 l was injected on a mass spectrometer. a 35-cm analytical column and a 3-cm trap column were used. a positive spray voltage of 2,100 was used with an ion transfer tube temperature of 350\u00b0C. all four software-provided N-linked glycan databases were combined into a single nonredundant list used to identify glycopeptides. all glycopeptide hits were manually inspected. a human codon-optimized gene encoding the ectodomain (residues 14 to 1180) of the SARS-CoV S protein (UniProt accession no. P59594) was cloned into a modified pOPING vector (61) (Addgene), introducing a C-terminal tobacco etch virus (Qiagen) and 2 g of plasmid.
