{"summary": "VP16 is an abundant 65-kDa virion phosphoprotein synthesized late in infection. it acts during the earliest stages of infection to stimulate transcription of the viral IE genes. VP16 is targeted to the TAATGARATTC consensus sequence found in IE promoters. ts 2203 mutation blocks virus assembly, arguing that VP16 plays an essential role in virion maturation. the innate immune system is the first line of defense in response to virus infection. IFN binds to specific IFN receptors in an autocrine or paracrine manner. this leads to the formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription complex. transcriptional factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play important roles in virus-induced type I interferon gene activation following virus infection (15, 16) VP16 blocked both infection-induced and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-induced activation of the NF-B promoter and expression of NF-B-dependent genes. VP16 selectively blocked IRF-3-mediated but not IRF-7-mediated transactivation. rabbit anti-IRF-3 polyclonal antibody (PAb), mouse anti-CBP MAb, and mouse anti-VP16 MAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) all enzymes used for cloning procedures were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China) to construct VP16-HA and VP16-Flag, the VP16 gene was amplified from the HSV-1 genome. RNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) the cells were harvested, duplicate wells were pooled, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the resulting cDNA product was amplified using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector in the presence of 2 SYBR green master mix. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids, such as IFN--Luc, NF-B-Luc, (PRDIII-I)4-Luc, and ISRE-Luc. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with 100 HA units (HAU) of SeV ml1 for 16 h. a 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 g of the anti-HA MAb, anti-Flag MAb, anti-CBP MAb, or nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody. the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and then subjected to WB analysis. cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min at room temperature. cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-IRF-3 PAb (diluted 1:500) or with mouse anti-HA MAb (diluted 1:2,000) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. samples were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany) aline and lysed in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluroide, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml pepstatin, 10 g/ml aprot extracts were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel prepared in 0.5 Tris-borate-EDTA. protein-oligonucleotide complexes were electroblotted to a nylon membrane. the membrane was then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. mouse anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) MAb (isotype IgG2b) was purchased from Roche (Mannheim, Germany) Rabbit anti-IRF-3 polyclonal antibody (PAb), mouse anti-CBP MAb, and mouse anti-VP16 MAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) RNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) the cells were harvested, duplicate wells were pooled, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the resulting cDNA product was amplified using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids, such as IFN--Luc, NF-B-Luc, (PRDIII-I)4-Luc, and ISRE-Luc. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with 100 HA units (HAU) of SeV ml1 for 16 h or treated with IFN- or TNF-. HEK 293T cells (5 106) were cotransfected with 10 g of each of the indicated expression plasmids carrying Flag, Myc, or HA tags. for virus infection, the cells were then infected with HSV-1 for an additional 16 h at 20 h posttransfection. for each IP, a 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 g of the anti-HA MAb, anti-Flag MA cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.137 M NaCl, 0.003 M KCl, 0.008 M Na2HPO4, 0.001 M NaH2PO4; pH 7.4) for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. the cells were rinsed with PBS and then incuba whole-cell extracts were prepared at 40 h posttransfection with 5 g of expression plasmid. cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mM Tris-Cl. a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutated (mut) oligonucleotide corresponding to the IFN-stimulated response element region of the RANTES promoter was added to the cell extract before adding labeled probe. after 20 min of incubation with the probe, extracts were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (60:1 cross-link) prepared in 0.5 Tris-borate-EDTA. VP16 inhibits IFN- promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. expression of the VP16 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. hek 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of the IFN- promoter reporter plasmid pIFN-luc (A) or p(PRDIII-I)4-Luc (C) the data represent means + standard deviations of three replicates. medium from infected cells in shown in panel D was isolated and analyzed by ELISA. mRNA and protein levels of endogenous IFN- were upregulated by SeV infection. VP16 reduced the accumulation of endogenous IFN- mRNA and IFN- secretion. coexpression of VP16 also blocked the TNF-induced activation of the NF-B-Luc reporter. expression of VP16(1-410)-Flag blocked activation of the IFN- promoter. expression of VP16(1-210)-Flag only partially inhibited activation of the IFN- promoter. expression of VP16(1-210)-Flag was detected at their expected molecular mass. we overexpressed RIG-IN (a constitutively active variant containing only the amino-terminal CARD of RIG-I), MAVS, TBK1, IKKi, IRF-3/5D (a phosphomimetic form of IRF-3), and TRIF (a downstream adaptor of TLR-3) and analyzed the activation of the IFN- reporter in the presence of increasing amounts of VP16. luciferase assays were performed at 36 h after transfection. the expression of all adaptor proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. in uninfected cells, IRF-3 localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. expression of VP16, which localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, did not affect expression or localization of IRF-3. VP16 does not block the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF-3. the protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (B) or native PAGE (C) and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser396) (B) or anti-IRF3 (C) antibody. whole IRF-3 and -actin (as a loading control) were also detected. VP16 represses IRF-3- but not IRF-7-mediated activation. hek 293T cells were cotransfected with flag-IRF-3/5D or flag-IRF-7/6D. VP16 associates with both IRF-3 and p65 and blocks expression of NF-B-dependent genes. mmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using HEK 293T cells cotransfected with flag-tagged VP16 and HA-tagged IRF-3. we found that VP16 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with IRF-3 by the anti-HA MAb, but not by nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody IgG. HEK 293T cells were infected with WT HSV-1 at a multiplicity of 1 for 16 h. the cells were then lysed, and the extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-IRF-3 PAb or control IgG. precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-VP16 MAb. VP16-HA and Flag-p65 expression plasmids were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells for co-IP analysis. mRNA levels of endogenous IL-6 and IL-8 were strongly induced by TNF- treatment. mRNA levels of endogenous IL-6 and IL-8 were strongly induced. HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids VP16-HA and pMyc-IRF3(1-394) and pVP16(1-410)-Flag. VP16(1-410)-Flag was successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc MAb. no detectable VP16(1-210)-Flag was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Myc MAb. aa 1 to 410 of VP16 are required for binding to IRF-3. VP16 blocks the interaction between IRF-3 and the CBP coactivator. it has been shown that the histone acetyltransferase coactivators CBP and p300 associate with the phosphorylated form of IRF-3. aa 1 to 410 of VP16, a region that lacks the activation domain but retains the ability to block IFN gene expression, blocked the interaction between IRF-3/5D and the CBP coactivator. at 36 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays (IP) using anti-CBP MAb or nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1) the cells were lysed, and the clarified supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays using an anti-CBP MAb as in panel B. after seV infection, CBP was immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP MAb. the immunoprecipitate was also analyzed in HEK 293T cells with or without VP16 expression. VP16 has the same effect during HSV-1 infection. HEK 293T cells were mock infected or infected with wild-type HSV-1 or UV-inactivated HSV-1 for 12 h and then infected with SeV for another 12 h prior to co-IP analysis. VP16 blocks IRF-3\u2013CBP\u2013DNA complex formation. anti-CBP Ab and anti-IRF-3 Ab abrogate formation of the IRF-3\u2013CBP\u2013DNA complex. formation of either slower-migrating IRF-3\u2013CBP\u2013DNA complex or faster-migrating IRF-3\u2013DNA complex was fully abrogated by adding anti-IRF-3 Ab. HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmid Flag-IRF-3/5D for 36 h. the biotin-labeled probe corresponds to the PRDI-PRDIII motif of the IFN- promoter. the anti-CBP MAb (shown as CBP) and anti-IRF-3 PAb (shown as IRF3) were added as indicated to demonstrate the presence of CBP and IRF-3 in the protein-DNA complex. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the ISRE-Luc or RL-TK (internal control) reporter construct in the presence or absence of VP16-Flag. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated with IFN- or infected with SeV. a luciferase assay was performed at 16 h posttreatment. a flag-tagged VP16 expression plasmid was cotransfected into HEK 293T cells together with an IFN- promoter construct. ectopic expression of VP16 significantly inhibited seV-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter, similar to the positive-control influenza A virus NS1 protein. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV. luciferase activity was measured 16 h postinfection. results of an experiment similar to that shown in panel A. NF-B-driven luciferase activity was determined as described for panel A. we measured expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by tandem IRF binding sites from the IFN- promoter [PRDIII-I)4-Luc]. coexpression of VP16 significantly inhibited the activation of the reporter. VP16 contains a carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (residues 411 to 490) and a central conserved core (residues 49 to 385) to determine which region of VP16 was responsible for the inhibition of virus-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter. a series of VP16 expression plasmids were constructed in our study. luciferase assays were performed in HEK 293T cells. VP16 represses IFN- promoter activity at the IRF-3 level. ectopic expression of RIG-IN significantly activated the IFN- promoter. the expression of all adaptor proteins, including RIG-IN, MAVS, IKKi, TBK1, IRF-3/5D, MDA-5, and TRIF, was confirmed by Western blotting. a sketch map of the IFN- pathway mediated by both RLR (RIG-I and MDA-5) and leading to IFN- production was confirmed. VP16 does not prevent the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IRF-3. holocomplex can then bind to the IRF-3 sites in the IFN- promoter region eventually to activate the transcription of the IFN- gene. VP16 does not block the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF-3. heLa cells were transfected with a VP16-Flag expression plasmid or pCMV-Flag vector. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV for 8 h. ser 396 dimer formation is a consequence of IRF-3 phosphorylation. VP16 dimerization was not reduced in seV-infected cells expressing VP16 protein. VP16 represses IRF-3-mediated but not IRF-7-mediated activation. VP16 represses IRF-3- but not IRF-7-mediated activation. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged VP16 and p65. VP16 associates with both IRF-3 and p65 and blocks expression of NF-B-dependent genes. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids VP16-Flag and HA-IRF-3 or plasmids VP16-HA and Flag-IRF-7. at 36 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and the samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation assays. qRT-PCR levels were quantified for normalization of the data. the fold change in gene expression of IL-6 or IL-8 was determined by comparison to the mock-treated samples. the data represent means + standard deviations of three replicates. mRNA levels of endogenous IL-6 and IL-8 were strongly induced by TNF- treatment (Fig. 6E) coexpression of VP16 significantly reduced the accumulation of endogenous mRNAs of both IL-6 and IL-8. results suggest that VP16 also blocks the expression of NF-B-dependent genes. pMyc-IRF3(1-394) and pVP16(1-410)-Flag or pVP16(1-210)-Flag were transfected with plasmids pMyc-IRF3(1-394) and pVP16(1-410)-Flag were successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc MAb. no detectable VP16(1-210)-Flag was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Myc MAb from flag-IRF-3/5D and VP16-HA or VP16(1-410)-HA were transiently cotransfected into HEK 293T cells. VP16 coimmunoprecipitated with CBP but not with control antibody IgG. aa 1 to 410 of VP16, a region that lacks the activation domain but retains the ability to block IFN gene expression, blocked the interaction between IRF-3 and CBP in the context of HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmid VP16-HA or VP16(1-410)-HA. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV for another 16 h. then, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays. rabbit anti-IRF-3 PAb was used for detection of endogenous IRF-3 expression. VP16 was successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-CBP MAb from cells expressing VP16-HA. in seV-infected cells expressing truncated VP16(1-410)-HA, the amount of IRF-3 that coimmunoprecipitated together with CBP was significantly reduced. we cannot definitively demonstrate that the inhibitory effect is due to virion-associated VP16. VP16 blocks IRF-3\u2013CBP\u2013DNA complex formation. aa 1 to 410 region of VP16 was coexpressed with VP16. competition with excess WT ISREs from the IFN- promoter successfully depleted the binding of the complex. mutated ISRE failed to compete for IRF-3/5D binding activity. aa 1 to 410 region of VP16 did not bind to the PRDIII-PRDI site. VP16 diminishes activation of ISREs and ISGs downstream of IFN-. the binding of type I IFNs, including IFN- and IFN-, initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of ISREs and the induction of more than 300 ISGs. VP16 also diminishes the activation of ISREs and ISGs downstream of IFN-. HEK 293T cells were transfected with VP16-HA expression plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were then mock infected or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV for 8 h. virion host shutoff protein (vhs) suppresses the expression of TLRs and RLRs, blocks IRF-3 activation, and inhibits IFN and ISG induction (47). vhs from HSV-2 suppresses the expression of TLRs and RLRs, blocks IRF-3 activation, and inhibits IFN and ISG induction (47). vhs activity on ISG mRNAs is only observed in the absence of ICP0 (40) protein secretion, and its transcriptional activation domain, was not responsible for this inhibition activity. VP16 was demonstrated to block the TNF-induced activation of the NF-B promoter and expression of NF-B-dependent genes through interaction with NF-B subunit p65. VP16 does not block the nuclear translocation, phosphorylation, or dimerization of IRF-3 induced by SeV infection. this suggests that VP16 prevents the recruitment of CBP to transcriptionally active promoters. the fact that IRF-7-mediated activation is not blocked by VP16 is consistent with this interpretation. infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) binds to host IRF-3 and sequesters it together with CBP and p300 in nuclear bodies away from its normal binding sites on host genes. inhibition of proapoptotic activities of IRF-3 may also be important for the establishment of persistent lytic infection or latent infection by herpesviruses."}
