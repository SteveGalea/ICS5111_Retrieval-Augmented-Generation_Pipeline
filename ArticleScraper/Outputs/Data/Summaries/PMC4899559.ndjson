{"summary": "establishment of new humanembryonic stem cell lines and development of culture conditions are fundamental areas of research. recent studies have examined the clinical applications of stem cells from cell therapy products in regenerative medicine. many groups have attempted to establish hESC lines and remove animal-derived components from culture conditions. marrow stromal cells (Havasi et al., 2013), placental cells (Park et al., 2011), extracellular matrix and xeno-free medium can be used in feeder-free conditions for cultures without feeder cells. researchers have also attempted the development of extracellular matrix and xeno-free medium. new hESC lines have been established using human amniotic fluid cell-derived stem cells as feeder cells. hAFCs were stored frozen in vials in a liquid nitrogen(LN2 ) tank and thawed in T75 flasks coated with CELLStart. culture of hESCs SNUhES32 is a clinical grade cell line established inxeno-free medium using human foreskin fibroblasts as feeder cells. cells were subcultured using a Pasteur pipette once a week for maintenance. immunocytochemistry (ICC) of pluripotency Medium was removed from hESCs after 5\u20136 days of subculture. cells were then washed with dPBS, fixed with 4% PFA, washed with dPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) at a 1:1 ratio, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for at least 12 h. RT-PCR analysis of undifferentiation markers RNA was extracted from hESCs using an RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen) cells were then incubated under dark conditions at room temperature for 1 h. cells were then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min. cells were mixed with primary antibodies targeting Oct-4 and SSEA-4. cells were then incubated for 3 h and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min. hESCs culture using hAFCs as feeder cells withoutanimal derived components. culture of hAFCs hAFCs was stored frozen in vials in a liquid nitrogen(LN2 ) tank and thawed in T75 flasks coated with CELLStart (invitrogen) cells were cultured in medium containing 90% Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) for 3 days. immunocytochemistry (ICC), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry were used to analyze expression/activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP), a cell surface marker for the undifferentiated state of hESCs. cells were then washed with dPBS, fixed with 4% PFA, washed with dPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; RT-PCR analysis of undifferentiation markers RNA was extracted from hESCs using an RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen) RT-PCR analysis of undifferentiation markers RNA was extracted from hESCs using an RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen) hESCs were disassociated into single cells by treatment with accutase (Invitrogen) cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min to isolate cells. cells were mixed with primary antibodies targeting Oct-4 and SSEA-4. cells were then washed with dPBS, fixed with 4% PFA, washed with dPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) at a 1:1 ratio, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for at least for 12 h. primary antibodies for Oct-4 (Santa cruz), SSEA-4 (Millipore), TRA1-60 (Millipore) and TRA1- hESCs were disassociated into single cells by treatment with accutase (Invitrogen) cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min to isolate cells. cells were then incubated for 3 h and centrifuged for 3 min. cells were subjected to analysis using a flow cytometer (FACSAria; BD Bioscience) samples were prepared as described for the flow cytometry analysis of markers for undifferentiated cells after incubation with primary antibodies targeting Neu5Gc. cells were then analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Science) culture dishes were coated with a humanized extracellular matrix instead of 0.1% gelatin. hESC medium was replaced with a medium containing KO-SR XenoFree. both SNUhES32 and H1 were able to adapt to the new culture conditions. SNUhES32 colonies on hAFCs were expressed Oct-4, SSEA-4, TRA1-60, TRA1-81 and alkaline phosphatase (g, h, i, j, k, 200, l 30). RT-PCR analysis of stemness transcription factors, Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, for SNUhES32 (lane1) and H1 (lane2). c was detected in H1 cultured in STO (Fig. 4A) Flow cytometry analysis of nonhuman sialic acid(Neu5Gc) hAFCs were used as feeder cells, replacing mouse derived fibroblasts. these hAFCs were successful as feeder layers for both cell lines. hESCs will be able to be cultured in improved culture conditions. analysis with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies showed that the SNUhES32, grown on hAFCs, was free from Neu5Gc infection. however, even in human derived feeder cells used as areplacement for animal derived materials, the risks in clinical applications need to be broadly tested. characterization, stem cell banking, established guidelines for ethical and systemic limitations and regulation of experimental methods in detail for clinical applications. internationally standardized guidelines and regulations have been developed for individuals countries, including safety tests for quality assurance of basic cell cultures of hESCs and cell lines."}
