{"summary": "a series of emerging pathogen outbreaks have commanded the public\u2019s attention. the disease prevention and vector control response to the introduction and local spread of Zika virus infection in the united states is being blunted and hampered by congressional discord. herein, we detail the role of museum biorepositories in disease outbreak investigations. interdisciplinary approach serves as a new model for pathogen discovery. it will be critical going forward as zoonotic pathogens and diseases emerge in the future. an accredited museum linked through a single museum catalog number to ecological data, associated parasites, microbial pathogens, frozen tissues, genomic data, and publications. recent analyses have revised the taxonomy of many zoonotic pathogen reservoirs. many other species that serve as pathogen reservoirs are in need of critical taxonomic revision. archiving institution should maintain relational, web-accessible database linked to major biodiversity information servers. traditional voucher material should be stored in a type case and tissues should be held in a type rack in liquid nitrogen or -80\u00b0C freezers. future directions Field collections of natural history specimens often arise through dynamic collaborations that are capable of producing a diverse array of preparations and associated data. a biorepository nexus can be a powerful tool for research in pathogen discovery, environmental change, and host\u2013reservoir dynamics. long-term institutional commitment to support personnel and physical infrastructure Requires periodic inventory of the number and condition of biospecimens Box 1 Advantages and Disadvantages of museum biorepositories and Integrated Databases Advantages: Maintains spatially broad, temporally deep and site-intensive archives of ultra-frozen vertebrate tissues Permanently links host specimens and tissues."}
