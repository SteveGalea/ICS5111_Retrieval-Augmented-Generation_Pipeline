{"summary": "the clinical syndrome caused by ZIKV in humans consists in a mild influenza-like illness resolving within days that occurs in approximately 20% of infected individuals. the most common signs and symptoms of ZIKV infection arise after 3\u20137 days from mosquito bite. CD4+ T-cells proliferated and produced Th1 cytokines in mice. their depletion reduced humoral response and reduced humoral response. the role of V2 T-cells during Flavivirus infection is not clearly depicted. in acute dengue (DENV) infection, V2 T-cells are able to exert a potent antiviral activity by expressing CD107a and by producing IFN- against DENV-infected cells. the aim of this work was to investigate the antiviral capability of V2 T-cells against ZIKV infection. EM medium (70.000 cells/250 L/well) infected with ZIKV at MOI 1 (multiplicity of infection) for 2 h in serum-free medium at 37 \u00b0C and 5% of CO2. cells were washed with PBS 1X, and co-cultured with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or expanded V2 T-cells. cDNA was amplified in triplicate using random hexamers. the resulting cDNA (25 ng) was amplified in triplicate using the SensiFAST SYBR Green PCR master mix. antibodies used to analyze V2 T-cells were anti-FITC, PerCP Cy5.5 and Pacific Blue. cells were stained with specific monoclonal antibodies for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. the ability of ZIKV to induce V2 T-cells degranulation was monitored. Isotype control primary antibody (Mouse IgG2a Neg control, MABC004F, Millipore, Milan, Italy) was used as control. cells were stained with a secondary antibody for 20 min at RT in permeabilizing solution. 2.7. Perforin and Cytokines Quantification To quantify Perforin, interferon- (IFN-) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- (TNF-) released by V2 T-cells, we co-cultured expanded V2 T-cells with mock/ ZIKV-infected cells. after 18 h, supernatants were collected and Perforin/IFN-/TNF- release was analyzed with an anti-Perforin, DMEM supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum 10%, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 IU/mL Penicillin and 50 g/mL Streptomycin (EuroClone, Siziano, Italy) in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% of CO2. the cells were infected with the ZIKV strain MR766. Expanded V2 T-cells were obtained by culturing PBMC of HD with a Phosphoantigen (IPH1101, 3 M; Innate Pharma, Marseille, France) plus IL-2 (100 IU/mL) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% of CO2. cells were isolated by magnetic separation (Miltenyi Biotec, Bologna, Italy) obtaining a purity of >95%. real-time PCR was performed using StepOne plus. anti-V2 FITC, anti-CD3 PerCP Cy5.5 and anti-CD3 Pacific Blue (all BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy) cells were stained with a specific cocktail of NKG2DL monoclonal antibodies for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. after fixation, cells were washed once with buffer and stained with anti-Panflavi primary antibody. cells were labeled with anti-CD3-PB for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, washed and labeled with Annexin V-FITC for 10 min at RT. after one wash, cells were labeled with PI (20 g/mL) and immediately acquired by flow cytometry. cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in complete medium and cultured with mock/ZIKV-infected cells. p value 0.05 were considered statistically significant (* p 0.05, ** p 0.01, *** p 0.001) 49 cells were infected with ZIKV MR766 strain. the frequency of ZIKV+ cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. the expansion index was calculated by dividing V2 T-cells frequency at 7 days in respect to T0. mock-A549 cells significantly increased the expansion of V2 T-cells. the frequency of AnnexinV + -A549 cells was significantly higher in ZIKV-infected than in Mock co-cultures at both 1:1 and 5:1, respectively. a significant increase of CD107a+ V2 T-cells was observed after co-culture with ZIKV-infected cells if compared to mock-infected cells. a higher perforin release was observed in ZIKV-infected cells co-culture at both ratios. the frequency of V2 + /CD107a+ cells was measured after the culture. background (mock/ZIKV+ apoptotic/necrotic cells without expanded V2 T-cells) was subtracted. data were represented as median + interquartile range. KG2DLs were quantified by RT-PCR 48 h post ZIKV infection. results showed a significant increase of MICA (p 0.05) and MICB (p 0.05) mRNA in ZIKV-infected A549 cells compared to mock-A549 cells. however, this mild mRNA up-regulation was clearly confirmed at protein level. a large fraction of freshly isolated ex vivo V2 T-cells express NKG2D that was significantly increased in expanded V2 T-cells [97.9% (82.0\u201398.7)] representative histograms of NKG2D expression are shown in Figure 5A. the frequency of NKG2D+ cells among V2 T-cells was compared in 9 experiments at T0 (white bars) and T12 days (squares bars) the frequency of NKG2D+ cells among V2 T-cells was compared in 9 experiments at T0 (white bars) and T12 days (squares bars) ZIKV MR766, the well-adapted virus, was able to replicate in A549 cells after 48 h of ZIKV MR766 infection. in this condition, we obtained the higher frequency of ZIKV-infected A549 cells able to be cultured for further days without confluence-induced cell death. V2 T-cells Recognize and Kill ZIKV-infected Cells During acute ZIKV infection in humans, an expansion of V2 T-cells has been reported [21]. in order to define the capability of ZIKV-infected cells to expand V2 T-cells in vitro, we co-cultured mock or ZIKV-infected A549 cells with PBMC of HD. the frequency of AnnexinV + -A549 cells was significantly higher in ZIKV-infected than in Mock co-cultures at both 1:1, [ZIKV-A549: median 2.4% (IQR: 1\u20135.7) vs. Mock-A549: 0.9% (0.0\u20132.4) p 0.002)] and 5:1, (ZIKV-A549: 3.3 (1.7\u201328) vs. Mock-A5 expanded V2 T-cells were cultured overnight with mock (white bars) or ZIKV-infected A549 cells (grey bars) cells. after 18 h, apoptotic/necrotic A549 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. collected and IFN- (n-8) and TNF- (n-5) were quantified by ELISA assays. data were represented as median + interquartile range. 3.3. ZIKV Infection Increased NKG2D Ligand Expression in A549 cells. DL mRNA levels in ZIKV-infected cells compared with control mock cells were measured by real-time qPCR (n-5). the frequency of MICA/B +, ULBP-1 +, and ULBP-2+ was measured on mock/ZIKV-infected cells. a large fraction of freshly isolated ex vivo V2 T-cells express NKG2D. h and analyzed the frequency of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. the frequency of apoptotic cells was compared in 9 experiments at T0. /ZIKV+ apoptotic/necrotic cells without expanded V2 T-cells were subtracted to all conditions. a similar expansion of V2 T-cells has been reported during SARS-CoV infection. expanded V2 T-cells were previously shown to produce IFN- and express granzyme B. this suggests a potential cytotoxic capability in the first phases of ZIKV infection [21] a reduction of NKG2D expression on NK cells in WNV-infected patients has been reported. further analysis in ZIKV-infected patients is mandatory in order to verify effect of ZIKV infection on NKG2D expression on V2 T-cells in vivo. our data indicate that V2 T-cells exert a potent NKG2D-mediated cytolytic function against ZIKV infected cells. the lack of V2 T-cells expansion might be associated with disease complications."}
