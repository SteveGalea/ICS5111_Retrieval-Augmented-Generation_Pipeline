{"summary": "proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids constitute receptors for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. some serve as \u2018attachment factors\u2019 that concentrate virus on the cell surface and stimulate it to bind to secondary receptors or co-receptors that guide virus entry into cells. bovine adeno-associated virus and human parvovirus B19 use gangliosides, adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1), AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, bovine parvovirus, porcine parvovirus, and minute virus of mice (MVM) use SIA, AAV2 and AAV3b use heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and AAV9 utilizes terminal galactose as a both MVM viruses specifically recognize 2-3 sialylated glycans with a type-2 Gal1-4GlcNAc motif (3\u2032SIA-LN) and a Lewis X Gal1-4(Fuc1-3)GlcNAc motif (3\u2032SIA-Lex) the two viruses share 97% sequence identity in the capsid viral protein (VP) amino acid sequence and are serologically indistinguishable. odeficient mice MVMi causes acute leucopenia [30], while MVMp infection is asymptomatic [31]. the 3\u2032SIA-LeX motif has been proposed as the mediator of transformed cell recognition by the MVM viruses and the interaction with the multisialylated 2-8 glycans. NB324K is a clone of simian virus-40 transformed human newborn kidney fibroblast cells that is permissive for both MVMp and MVMi. glycomic profiling was performed with 1107 cells of each mammalian cell line. the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS without Ca2+or Mg2+, pelleted, and resuspended in 10 ml of TE8.7 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.7, 0.5 mM EDTA) per liter of infected cells. after three cycles of freeze-thaw at 37\u00b0C the samples were centrifuged repeatedly at 800g. 5 l of purified virus at an estimated concentration of 2.0 mg/ml was spotted on a 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grid. the sample was negatively stained twice with NanoW (Nanoprobe) for 1 min, blotted dry, and viewed on a Hitachi 3000 electron microscope. for SGM screening, all viruses were buffer-exchanged into 1XPBS. the cellular debris was removed by low speed centrifugation at 12,064g, 15 min, and 4\u00b0C in a JA-20 rotor. the supernatant was diluted with TNET buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mM MgCl2). virus fractions were extracted with a syringe and needle and dialyzed against TE buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA) then subjected to equilibrium centrifugation at 209,491g for 24 h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. the concentration of the viruses was estimated from optical density measurements. the slides were washed again with Wash buffer and incubated at RT for 1 h. an anti-MVM capsid antibody was added at a dilution of 15,000. the slides were scanned with a microarray scanner equipped with 4 lasers. any value with a %CV of >30, was considered unacceptable. NB324K is a clone of simian virus-40 transformed human newborn kidney fibroblast cells that are permissive for both MVMp and MVMi [36]. the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was stored at 80\u00b0C. further processing of the cell lines to derivatize, extract, purify, and analyze the glycans by mass spectrometry was carried out. samples were centrifuged at 209,491g for 18 h at 18\u00b0C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. full and empty capsid concentrations were assessed by hemagglutination and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the capsid integrity was checked by negative-stain electron microscopy. the cells were spun down at 1,588g for 15 min in a JA-10 rotor. then the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2) a visible blue fraction containing VLPs, sedimenting at 20\u201325% sucrose, was extracted with a syringe and needle, and dialyzed against TE buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA) the concentration of the viruses was estimated from optical density measurements and adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml using Ultrafree 150 kDa cut-off centrifugal filter units. slides were washed and blocked with 50 mM ethanolamine in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) for 1 h. prior to screening the slides were rehydrated for 5 minutes in TSM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2 and 0.2 mM MgCl2) the virus samples were diluted with Binding Buffer (TSM buffer plus 1% BSA and all glycans were ranked according to their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. variance within the 4 replicates was assessed as the coefficient of variation (%CV) any value with a %CV of >30, was considered unacceptable as reported in Song et al. Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE for MVMp-VLP (a.1), MVMp-Empty (b.1), MVMp-Full (c.1), MVMi-VLP (d.1), MVMi-Empty (e.1), MVMi-Full (f.1). images in (b.2), (c.2), (d.2), (e.2), and (f.2) were collected glycans that were derivatized with Neu5Ac9-O-methyl sialic acid, MVMp and MVMi bound only to two glycans, SGM 23 (Neu5Ac9Me2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc1-3Gal1-4Glcitol) and SGM 55 (Neu5Ac9Me2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc1-2Man1-3)Man1-4GlcNAcitol) are the bars represent relative fluorescence for a given glycan. the glycans showing specificity to the MVMp viruses are labeled. all the MVMp viruses showed weak binding to two additional glycans. the affinity ranking for the MVMi viruses was 9-O-methylated-monosialylated (SGM 23) >9-O-methylated-biantennary (SGM 55) >9-O-acetylated-biantennary (SGM 55) >9-O-lactolylated-biantennary (SGM 55)>SIA-biantennary (SGM 48) Consistent with the previous glycan array screening studies, glycans can only be linked 2-8 or 2-9 to each other. SIA-SIA (multisialylated) glycans are annotated in cartoon form. the glycans are annotated in the cartoon form. inset depicts the cartoon legend. the glycans are annotated in the cartoon form. the NB324K cell line expresses more multi-antennary, poly lacNAc extended glycans than A9 and EL4 T cells. for ease of identification, the common names (if known) of the identified glycolipids are included in Figure 6. the core motif in GT3 (Neu5Ac-Neu5Ac-Neu5Ac-Neu5Ac-Gal-Glc) is also present in the GT1c that is expressed in EL4 T cells albeit also at low abundance (enclosed in blue box in Figure 6A and B) the ability to produce high quality O-glycan data after initial removal of N-glycans can be limited by low cell numbers. i-Full, MVMi-Empty, and MVMi-VLP were verified by SDS-PAGE. full capsids contained VP1 (83 kDa), VP2 (64 kDa), and VP3 (61 kDa) empty capsids contained VP1 and VP2; and all the VLPs contained only VP2. negative stain EM analysis showed the full and empty capsids and the binding profile was similar for the VLPs, empty, and full capsids. MVMp and MVMi specifically bound only to the 2-3 linked sialylated derivatives. the sialic acid is 2-6 linked and not recognized by. the biantennary glycan, SGM 48 (Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc1-2Man1-3)Man1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAcitol) showed weak binding to two additional glycans that were not recognized by the MVMi viruses. the binding profile for the genome containing viruses, especially MVMp virions, showed some weak non-specific binding, with high %CV, to other glycans compared to the VLPs and empty capsids. the affinity ranking for the MVMi viruses was 9-O-methylated-monosialylated (SGM 23) >9-O-methylated-biantennary (SGM 55) >9-O-acetylated-bian three cell lines, A9 fibroblasts (permissive for MVMp), EL4 T lymphocytes (permissive for MVMi) and NB324K transformed cells (permissive for both MVMp and MVMi) were subjected to glycomic profiling by MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS/MS analysis. the glycans are annotated in the cartoon form. inset depicts the cartoon legend. the NB324K cell line expresses more multi-antennary, poly lacNAc extended glycans than A9 and EL4 T cells. the polar glycolipids present in the spectra are consistent with. the glycolipids present in the spectra are consistent with. the glycolipids present in the spectra are consistent with. all the glycolipids were identified to be gangliosides (GalNAc1-4Gal1-4GlcCeramide motif) the multisialylated glycans are present in the polar glycolipid fraction for all the three cell lines. the core motif in GT3 is also present in the GT1c that is expressed in EL4 T cells albeit also at low abundance. SIA containing O-glycan is expressed on the NB324K cells. the remaining O-glycans belong to core 2 (GlcNAc1-6(Gal1-3)GalNAcSer/Thr) the remaining O-glycans belong to core 2 (GlcNAc1-6(Gal1-3)GalNAcSer/Thr) derivatives were recognized, further confirming that the N-acetyl group at C-5 is preferred. the N-acetyl group at C-5 is within interaction distance of the side-chain of D399 and backbone of E400 in the MVM VP2 sequence. the MVMp and MVMi viruses showed stronger binding to 2-3 SIA that is methylated at position C-9 of Neu5Ac. recognition of GM 48 suggests a strong preference for its structure. this is consistent with the previous glycan array screenings. the MVMp viruses, but not MVMi viruses, bound to the 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac derivative (SGM 52) glycan array screening studies focused on identifying oligosaccharide motif(s) recognized by MVM among a large number of different glycans [24] while screening on the SGM enabled the exploration of differential SIA-MVM strain recognition. this screen identified, for the first time, the recognition of biantennary glycans with terminal 3\u2032SIA-LN motifs. the glycan SIA-LN-LN motif was recognized in previous glycan array screening. the NB324K medium mass N-glycan fraction (m/z = 4850.2) showed a variety of carbohydrates, including Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and non-sialylated glycans. this observation thus validates the use of such arrays to identify potential binding partners for macromolecules, including viruses. the NB324K cell line is a transformed cell line that expresses sialylated N-glycans with the SIA-Lex motif. this motif was recognized previously by the MVM viruses on a glycan array [24]. this supports the suggestion that the SIA-Lex motif on tumor cell lines might be utilized by the oncotropic MVM viruses for infection. these observations support previous claims that the determinant of differential cell and tissue tropism for MVMp and MVMi is post cell entry. previous reports identified amino acids at and surrounding the depression at icosahedral 2-fold axes of the capsid. the observed similarity in glycan recognition by the two viruses suggests that the critical glycan interacting residue(s) is conserved. MVM Binds to Diverse Sialylated Derivatives Glycan arrays attempt to mimic the diversity of glycans present on cell surfaces. if a virus specifically recognizes a particular type of glycan on these arrays, it suggests that the virus may also recognize similar glycans in its natural host. the recognition of similar glycans by full and empty capsids of each particular strain indicates that the encapsidation the N-acetyl group at C-5 is within interaction distance of the side-chain of D399 and backbone of E400 in the MVM VP2 sequence. the MVMp and MVMi viruses showed stronger binding to 2-3 SIA that is methylated at position C-9 of Neu5Ac (SGM 23 and SGM 55), compared to the other derivatives (acetylated or lactoylated Neu5Ac, such as SGM 52 and SGM 60, recognition of SGM 48 suggests a strong preference for its structure. this is consistent with the previous glycan array screenings. the MVMp viruses, but not MVMi viruses, bound to the 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac derivative (SGM 52) glycan array screening studies had focused on identifying oligosaccharide motif(s) recognized by MVM among a large number of different glycans [24] while screening on the SGM enabled the exploration of differential SIA-MVM strain recognition. this screen identified, for the first time, the recognition of biantennary glycans with terminal 3\u2032SIA-LN motifs. the glycan SIA-LN-LN motif was recognized in previous glycan array screening. the three cell lines displayed a variety of carbohydrates, including Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and non-sialylated glycans. this observation thus validates the use of such arrays to identify potential binding partners for macromolecules, including viruses. NB324K cell line is a transformed cell line that expresses sialylated N-glycans with the SIA-Lex motif. expression of this motif has also been specifically observed in the N-glycan profile of other transformed cell lines. this supports the suggestion that the SIA-Lex motif might be utilized by the oncotropic MVM viruses for infection. these observations support previous claims that the determinant of differential cell and tissue tropism for MVMp and MVMi is post cell entry. previous reports identified amino acids at and surrounding the depression at icosahedral 2-fold axes of the capsid. the observed similarity in glycan recognition by the two viruses suggests that the critical glycan interacting residue(s) is conserved. ialylated glycans, and the biantennary glycans are found on cell surfaces. the abundance and variability of SIA containing glycans makes them suitable receptors for numerous interactions. structure with an asterisk are monosialylated glycans."}
