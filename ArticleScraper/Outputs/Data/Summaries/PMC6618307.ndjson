{"summary": "aptamers are small single-stranded artificial nucleotides (DNA or RNA) targets include a variety of small molecules such as amino acids, nucleotides, and antibiotics. the secondary and tertiary structures of aptamers ensure the binding specificity to their targets via aptamer-target recognition. the third step is to purify and amplify bound sequences to form a new sequence pool for the next cycle. a negative selection, or counter selection, step involves incubating the sequence pool with target analogs, undesired subtypes, or the unbound sequences. in the binding step, the sequence pool is incubated with the target. amer sequences $8,000 for mouse monoclonal antibody $20,000 for rabbit monoclonal antibody - Synthesis and manufacture Chemically synthesis in vitro Produced in animal and then by recombinant methods. the bioreceptor recognizes and binds the target with high sensitivity and selectivity. the transducer then outputs biological signals from the interaction between the analyte and the bioreceptor. the transducer then translates and outputs biological signals from the interaction between the analyte and the bioreceptor. the principle of SPR aptasensors is shown in Figure 2A. the aptamer-virus interaction changes the angle of reflected light. the aptamer-virus interaction changes the angle of reflected light. aptamers IF10 and IF22 bound different sites of the same H5N1 virus, acting as the capturing probe and signal probe. the detection sensitivity of this biosensor was found to be 200 EID50/ml (50% embryo infective dose/ml) for H5N1 virus in feces samples. nanomaterial-assisted colorimetric aptasensors support the capturing aptamer. the aptamer was modified with magnetic beads to capture the virus. aptasensor detected the virus at levels as low as 11.16 g/ml. ELISA is a basic diagnostic method for detecting complex target molecules. aptamers are used as a substitution for antibodies as the bio-receptor or the transducer. ELAA is also known as an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide adsorption test. the aptamer/antibody pair showed the best detection. the detection limit was worse than the aptamer/antibody pair. the aptamer has lower production cost and displayed a high degree of batch-to-batch consistency. CL assays are another technology extensively applied in clinical diagnosis. the detecting principle of a typical CL aptasensor is similar to the principle of colorimetric-based aptasensors. aptamers distinguished influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and influenza A. an aptamer was modified on magnetic beads to catch the virus. another fluorescence-labeled universal aptamer marked the captured analyte. a sol-gel protein chip was generated for detecting HCV core antigen. the aptamer, named F-BA1-D, had a hairpin structure in its body region. the hairpin structure placed the quencher and fluorophore near each other, inhibiting fluorophore emission. the other oligomer, DA-2, was a non-structured oligomer. aptasensor detected thiazole orange fluorescence in aqueous solution and patient serum. the detection process could be completed in under 30 min. aptamer and QDs developed an aptasensor for detecting H1N1. aptamer was modified on QDs to build a capturing probe. another aptamer amplified the fluorescence polarization value. interferometry is a label-free technique that measures light intensity generated by the interference of different light beams. the information includes the index of refraction or physical properties, for example, the thickness of a film. electrical aptasensors are classified as electrochemical aptasensors or piezoelectric transducers based on their detection mechanism. biotin-modified DNA aptamers were immobilized on the electrode. when the virus sample flowed through the microfluidic module, the aptamer captured the target, increasing the impedance. aptasensors were developed to detect influenza A and vaccinia virus. the aptamer probe is on the diamond-FET surface. in the presence of virus, the aptamer captures the virus and forms a complex with a second aptamer strand. this causes changes in electric charges on the surface, which is sensed by the electrode. aptasensor detected H5N1 as low as 8 104 HAU in 200L samples. the capturing aptamer was immobilized onto glassy carbon electrodes. the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide was employed as the signal reporter. this compound slightly inhibited electron transfer caused by redox. an anti-H5N1 antibody, modified with alkaline phosphatase, generated an electrocatalytic reaction with the substrates. the lowest detectable concentration of this biosensor was 100 fM, and the linear range was 100 fM to 10 pM. quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), a type of piezoelectric transducer, uses the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals to translate changes on the quartz crystal electrode surface into changes in the output signal frequency. in QCM aptasensors, the aptamer is fixed on the quartz crystal electrode to capture the target, and the combination of the aptamer and target changes the quality of the pole, which is then transduced into detectable frequency changes. an aptamer specific to the HCV core antigen was immobilized on an atomic force microscopy chip. after incubation with the antigen, the chip underwent atomic force microscopy scanning. detection limit was as low as 0.1 pM. 5\u2032-ACACAAATCCTATTGACCGCTGTGTGACGCAACACTCAAT-3\u2032 Liu et al., 2017 HA Electrochemical method 103 pfu/ml 5\u2032-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTTGTG-3\u2032 Kiilerich-Pedersen et al., 2016 HA Electrochemical method 29 HAU 5\u2032-GTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT HA Electrochemical method 100 fM 5\u2032-TTGGGGTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG TTTGTCTTCCTGCC-3\u2032 Wang et al., 2016 Influenza virus HA TEM 3 108 viral particles. le et al., 2014 Nucleoprotein SERS - 5\u2032-TACgACTCACTATAgggATCCTgTTAgTgAgggTT-3\u2032 Nitsche et al., 2007;

(2018) proposed an aptamer-based fluorescent NP tracking analysis of viruses. aptamer bound viral glycoproteins to mark RSV. this analysis method was able to detect viruses larger than 80\u2013100 nm. SERS-based aptasensor detects the viral nucleoprotein of influenza. in the system, Ag nanorods acted as the active substrates. polyvalent anti-influenza aptamers were immobilized on the surface. amers changes the thickness of the gold surface, and the refractive index varies. the bound target on the surface can be quantified by monitoring the angles or intensity of the polarized light. the principle of SPR aptasensors is shown in Figure 2A. aptamers IF10 and IF22 bound different sites of the same H5N1 virus, acting as the capturing probe and signal probe. the detection sensitivity of this biosensor was found to be 200 EID50/ml (50% embryo infective dose/ml) for H5N1 in feces samples. the principle of typical colorimetric-based aptasensors is shown in Figure 2B. nanomaterials support the capturing aptamer, and some also take part in the signal conversion. Chen et al. (2016) used an H3N2-specific aptamer modified with magnetic beads to capture the virus. the combination of the aptamer and virus reduces this catalytic hindrance. the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine is added to the system to visualize the result. the resulting color changes are highly correlated to the amount of virus. the aptamer/antibody pair exhibited the best detection. the detection limit was worse than the aptamer/antibody pair. the aptamer has lower production cost and displayed a high degree of batch-to-batch consistency. Chen et al. (2016) used an H3N2-specific aptamer modified with magnetic beads to capture the virus. the complexes bound the virus through a con-glycan interaction. this aptasensor detected the virus at levels as low as 11.16 g/ml with the help of a UV-vis instrument. aptamers are used as a substitution for antibodies as the bio-receptor or the transducer. ELAA is also known as an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide adsorption test (ELOSA or ELONA) an enzyme-linked aptasorbent assay (ELASA) amer1/aptamer2 pair was worse than the aptamer/antibody pair. but the author postulated that further research to optimize the aptamer/antibody pair may improve the detection effect. lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) uses capillary beds that transport fluid. aptasensor is similar to the principle of colorimetric-based aptasensors. an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody to the N protein was employed to transduce the signal. this aptasensor detected SARS-CoV N protein at levels as low as 2 pg/ml. aptamer-real-time-PCR method was used to detect the virus. a reporter aptamer was added into the system to bind the virus. the content of virus was calculated by measuring the bound reporter aptamer using the TaqMan RT-PCR reaction. the hairpin structure placed the quencher and fluorophore near each other, inhibiting fluorophore emission. the other oligomer, DA-2, was a non-structured oligomer. when the HIV-1 Tat protein was present, a stabilized ternary complex formed, in which the fluorophore and the quencher were separated and fluorescent light was released. the detection process could be completed in under 30 min. using the chemiluminescent resonance transfer strategy, Kim et al. (2018) designed an aptasensor for norovirus GII. aptasensor detected H1N1 at levels as low as 3.45 nM. another aptamer, specific to both the H1N1 protein and SA, amplified the fluorescence polarization value. aptamers distinguished influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses. aptamers successfully detected human noroviruses from clinical samples. they selected an aptamer RNATat specific to the HIV Tat protein. aptamer was split into two oligomers to build a molecular beacon aptamer. metal-enhanced fluorescence occurs when the emission of the fluorophore is enhanced around specific metal materials. the main reagents included a core\u2013shell of Ag-SiO2 NPs, aptamers and thiazole orange. the fluorescent aptamer bound viral glycoproteins to mark RSV. this analysis method was able to detect viruses larger than 80\u2013100 nm. quantitative dots (QDs) are spherical-like inorganic semiconductor fluorescent nanocrystals. SERS-based aptasensor detects the viral nucleoprotein of influenza. in the system, Ag nanorods acted as the active substrates. polyvalent anti-influenza aptamers were immobilized on the surface. in aptasensors without enzymes, aptamers are immobilized on the electrode. the binding of aptamer to its target changes the impedance directly. the basic mechanism is shown in Figure 3A. the combination of aptamer and target virus changes the electrical signal on the electrode. aptamer binds the bio-nanogate to close the \u201cdoor\u201d and keep the enzyme away from the coenzyme and substrate. the target virus can grab the aptamer from the nanogate and the enzyme on the electrode reacts with the coenzyme and substrate. aptasensor detected H5N1 as low as 8 104 HAU in 200L samples. this aptasensor detected 3.3 pg/ml, with two different linearity ranges. two thiolated ssDNA probes hybridized with the aptamer. they were fixed on a nanoporous gold film and fixed on a nanoporous gold film. aptamer restricted the enzymatic reaction by keeping lactate dehydrogenase from its coenzymes and substrates. aptamer RNATat was linked to an aminated diamond surface by terephthalic acid. when virus was captured by the RNATat aptamer, a second strand was added to change the potential gate voltage by transforming the duplex structure of itself and of the initial aptamer. this aptasensor detected 1 nM HIV-1 Tat protein in samples. the aptamer-ssDNA gel was fixed on a gold surface using a self-assembled monolayer method. in the absence of target virus, the gel retained a shrunken state. the combination of aptamer and the virus disrupted the connection between the aptamer and the ssDNA, causing the gel to swell. electrochemical aptasensors are categorized based on their method of producing electrical signals. first, in aptasensors without enzymes, the binding of aptamers to targets directly leads to an electrical signal change. second, in aptasensors with enzymes, the electrical signal change is aided by enzyme catalysis. asensor finished detection within 1 h with a detection limit of 1 HAU for the H5N1(+) tracheal chicken swab samples. the basic mechanism of aptasensors with enzymes is aptasensors. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an electrochemical measuring method that applies a small amplitude sinusoidal potential or current as a disturbance signal. in EIS bio-sensors, the incident sinusoidal wave changes when it passes through the electrode, and these changes reflect the characteristics of the electrode. nanogates are nanodevices that control chemical or biological reactions. the basic mechanism is shown in Figure 3C. using this technology, Wang et al. (2015) developed a label-free aptasensor. diamond-aptamer aptasensors immobilize aptamers on FET to detect changes in charge distribution as a result of the binding of aptamers and target molecules. aptamer RNATat, against the Tat protein of HIV-1, was linked to an aminated diamond surface by terephthalic acid. aptasensor detected 1 nM HIV-1 Tat protein in samples. aptasensors were developed to detect influenza A virus and vaccinia virus. the aptasensor finished detection within 1 h with a detection limit of 1 HAU for the H5N1(+) tracheal samples. an auNP-modified carbon electrode modified with an aptamer. the working mechanism was similar to the sensors introduced above. the detection limit of this aptasensor was 180 virus particles. the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide was employed as the signal reporter. this compound slightly inhibited electron transfer caused by redox. aptasensor detected 3.3 pg/ml, with two different linearity ranges. an anti-H5N1 antibody, modified with alkaline phosphatase, generated an electrocatalytic reaction with the substrates. the lowest detectable concentration of this biosensor was 100 fM, and the linear range was 100 fM to 10 pM. the combination of the aptamer and target changes the quality of the pole. the lowest detectable concentration was 0.25 mg/L, and the sensor was regenerated with NaOH and alcohol. the antibody-based sensor had a wider linear range but a lower sensitivity. aptamer-modified AuNPs coated a viral envelope to form a gold nanoshell, which was visualized using transmission electron microscopy. the detection limit was as low as 0.1 pM.

10 antiviral drugs may interact with other drugs, leading to even lower efficacy. aptamers could be applied to antiviral therapy. clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis could aid in aptamer uptake. modified DNA aptamer, C7-35M, directly targeted the globular region of the AIV H9-type HA protein, suppressing virus attaching to host cells. in the penetration process of herpes simplex virus, the gD protein plays a key role by recognizing two protein receptors on target cells, herpes virus entry mediator and nectin-1. another DNA aptamer targeting gD was selected for curbing herpes simplex virus-1 infection. aptamer B.2 inhibited the non-structural 5B polymerase. aptamer 27v and 127v blocked both the initiation and the elongation of viral RNA synthesis, while the aptamer 127v inhibited the initiation and postinitiation events. the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein is crucial in the encapsidation of virus nucleic acids and the installment of virus particles. the retroviral psi packaging element is a cis-acting RNA element in the genome of HIV. aptamer-siRNA chimera is a glycoprotein expressed on the HIV envelope. the aptamer carried the siRNA to cells infected with HIV-1. the siRNA inhibited HIV replication. ssDNA Targeting the HA 5\u2032-AACGCTCACTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC a-3\u2032 Zhang et al., 2015 DNA Recognize the HA protein and inhibit the binding of the virus 5\u2032-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGGGGGTGTTATGGTCGAATAAGTTAACG-3\u2032 Jeon et al., 2004;
