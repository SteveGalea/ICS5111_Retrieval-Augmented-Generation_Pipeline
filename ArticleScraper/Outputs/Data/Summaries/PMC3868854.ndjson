{"summary": "a cytopathic virus with coronavirus morphology was isolated from a 1.5-week-old piglet from a swine farm in Iowa. a plaque-cloned virus isolate was further propagated in the cells for 2 more cell passages, for a total of 6 cell passages (P6). colostrum-deprived piglets orally inoculated with the isolate at a rate of 103 PFU/ml developed severe watery diarrhea and dehydration within 24 hpi. intensive immunohistochemical staining of almost all enterocytes for PEDV was observed at 18 hpi. entire genome of the isolate USA/Iowa/18984/2013 was sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology on the Ion Torrent platform. PEDV isolate USA/Iowa/18984/2013 is a virulent strain with a genetic profile similar to those of other U.S. PEDVs reported to date. such a representative purified PEDV isolate can be a valuable reagent for studying the pathogenesis and immunobiology of PEDV."}
