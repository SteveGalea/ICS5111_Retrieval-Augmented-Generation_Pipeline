{"summary": "species of the genus Satureja (family Lamiaceae) are widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, Asia and boreal America, regularly found in sunny, dry, rocky habitats. the genus is represented by only two species\u2014S. thymbra and S. fortii the second being endemic to Libya. the two species could be found only in the Green Mountains (Eastern Libya) acaricidal activity of S. thymbra essential oil and its major components carvacrol and -terpinene were tested against adult Hyalomma marginatum (Acari: Ixodidae) recently, the acaricidal activity of the essential oils from this and related plant species was evaluated against three stored-product insects [13] chemotypes have been described for a number of medicinal plants [14,18,19,20]. results and discussion The composition of the essential oil isolated from S. thymbra is given in Table 1. the essential oil was characterized by -terpinene (39.26%), thymol (5.16%), p-cymene (7.17%) and carvacrol (4.18%) as the major constituents. essential oil of the same species growing wild in turkey was also dominated by carvacrol (53.7%), followed by -terpinene (17.6%), thymol (13%) and p-cymene (10.1%). a study was carried out to evaluate the effect of harvesting time on essential oil composition of S. thymbra collected from different locations in Crete. 995.4 1002 0.28 0.00 3-carene 1001.2 1008 0.10 0.01 -terpinene 1007.8 1014 3.26 0.02 p-cymene 1016.1 1020 7.17 0.05 sylvestrene 1019.5 1025 0.78 0.01 cis--ocimene 1030.6 1032 0.52 0.00 trans--ocimene 1010.5 1025 0.78 0.01 -terpinene 1040.6 1032 0.52 cis-bergamotene c n/a 0.17 0.16 Total 99.81% Yield (v/w) % 4.9 Number of constituents 33 Monoterpene hydrocarbons 58.57% Oxygenated monoterpenes 31.21% Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons 5.23% Oxygenated hydrocarbons 1.27% Other 3.53% a KIE = Kovats (retention) index-literature data; c n/a IC50 of Origanum vulgare essential oil was dominated by -terpinene and thymol. carvacrol, present in relative high amounts in Thymbra capitata oil, can be partly responsible for high antioxidant activity. carvacrol, present in relative high amounts, can be partly responsible for high antioxidant activity. Streptomycin expressed inhibitory effects at 0.0005\u20130.001 mg/mL. it showed the highest bactericidal activity against Micrococcus flavus. the lowest (MBC = 0.2 mg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes. s 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.05 0.05 0.001 0.002 Gram. MIC and the MFC for -terpinene were 0.01\u20130.025 mg/mL. MIC and carvacrol showed lower antifungal activity than the tested oils. thymol (MIC and MFC 0.01\u20130.05 mg/mL) and lower than carvacrol (MIC at 0.0025\u20130.025 and MFC at 0.005\u20130.05 mg/mL) and slightly better or similar to -terpenene (0.015\u20130.05 mg/mL and 0.02\u20130.1 mg/mL) essential oil of S. thymbra was found to be active against bacteria E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, S. sonnei and S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans. previous investigations showed that the essential oil of S. thymbra present sufficient bactericidal effect on bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel. chitin synthase/chitinase/chitinase and -glucanases of fungi may have antagonized the antimicrobial action of essential oils against bacteria. the high content of phenolic components may account for the high antimicrobial activity of carvacrol-type oils. this may have antagonized the antimicrobial action of phenols. the effects of thymol and carvacrol are responsible for the different antibacterial activities of the essential oil of various oil chemotypes. the oil and components tested in here showed higher antibacterial activity against Gram (+) than Gram negative bacteria, in general, more resistant than Gram negative bacteria. GC analysis of the oil was carried out on a GC HP-5890 II apparatus. the oil was fitted with a split-splitless injector attached to a HP-5 column. the same analytical conditions were employed for GC-MS analysis. methanol was used as a blank, while methanol with DPPH solution was used as a control. butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was used as a positive control. antifungal activity For the antifungal bioassay eight fungi were used. micromycetes were kept on malt agar and cultures stored at 4 \u00b0C. spore suspension was adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of approximately 1.0 105 in a final volume of 100 L per well. bacterial suspensions adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 105 cfu/mL. bacterial suspensions were adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 105 cfu/mL. concentrations that completely inhibited bacterial growth (MICs) were defined as concentrations that completely inhibited bacterial growth (MICs) lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC, indicating 99.5% killing of the original inoculum. GC analysis of the oil was carried out on a GC HP-5890 II apparatus. it was equipped with a split-splitless injector attached to a HP-5 column. a solution (0.04 mg) was used to determine free radical-scavenging activity. 1,800 L of this solution was added to 200 L of essential oils in methanol. methanol was used as a blank, while methanol with DPPH solution was used as a control. all determinations were taken in triplicate and special care was taken. micromycetes were kept on malt agar and cultures stored at 4 \u00b0C. a modified microdilution technique was used to investigate the antifungal activity of the extracts. bacterial suspensions adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 105 cfu/mL. bacterial suspensions were adjusted with sterile saline to a concentration of 1.0 105 cfu/mL. the lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC. the optical density of each well was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm. a blank and a positive control was used as a positive control. essential oil may find industrial applications as natural preservatives and conservation agent in the cosmetic and/or food industries and as active ingredient in medical preparations."}
