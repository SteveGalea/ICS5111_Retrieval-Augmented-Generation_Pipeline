Fig. 5 shows frontiers where control of an Ebola-like disease requires increasingly invasive interventions, moving from health-seeking behavior to symptom monitoring to quarantine, the most invasive. control of this hypothetical disease can be achieved even if infectiousness precedes symptoms by several days. health-seeking behavior (teal), symptom monitoring (gold), or quarantine (blue) was the minimally sufficient intervention to bring R e below one. disease characteristics drawn from Ebola are assumed to precede infectiousness by up to 10 d (X = 10 d) or emerge up to 10 d after infectiousness onset (X = +10 d) the same as in A, but the x axis is transformed to represent the proportion of infections that occurs before symptoms. our results show that the benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is maximized for fast-course diseases. in settings where isolation is highly effective, a large fraction of contacts is traced, or there is a long delay between symptom onset and isolation. symptom monitoring is likely to be key intervention for future epidemic containment. we find that a reduction in the fraction of contacts who are ultimately traced will decrease the preference for quarantine over symptom monitoring. the results support the conclusion of Cetron et al. that the optimal containment strategy may allow \u201cpartial or leaky quarantine\u201d to increase the fraction of contacts who participate. contact tracing is the process of identifying and assessing people who have been exposed to a disease (34, 35). contacts who are symptomatic when traced are immediately placed in isolation; those who are not symptomatic are placed under either quarantine or symptom monitoring. if an individual becomes symptomatic, he/she will be isolated and receive healthcare. the delay between symptom onset and isolation (DSM) applies to individuals under symptom monitoring and is influenced by the frequency of monitoring, delays in recognizing sometimes unreliable clinical features, and delays in prompt isolation on symptom detection. 10 0.2 1 2.00 1.41 100 0.02 1 2 0.1 2.00 4.41 10 0.2 0.1 2.01 4.47 100 0.02 0.1 1.96 4.43 1 2 0.01 2.03

three levels of dispersion (1, 0.1, and 0.01) we use a sequential Monte Carlo particle filtering algorithm (40, 41) to create a joint probability space of the time offset between the latent period and incubation period ( T O F F S E T = T L A T T I N C ) from an uninformative prior distribution of each parameter bounded by published observations, we simulate five infection generations of 500 initial individuals. to allow for variable infectiousness during this duration, we assume a triangular distribution of relative infectiousness. to allow for variable infectiousness during this duration, we assume a triangular distribution of relative infectiousness and fit the time of peak infectiousness. uninfected individuals may be mistakenly traced as contacts. they may be followed for a length of time set up the 95th percentile incubation period ( T I N C 95 ). values of PINF 1 change the number of days in quarantine to d Q =. we allow relative infectiousness to vary with time since onset of infectiousness (36), with time of peak infectiousness occurring anywhere between the onset and end of infectiousness inclusively. the fraction of traced contacts can be less than one, encompassing symptomatic infectors who fail to recall contacts, asymptomatic \u201csilent\u201d infection events. in a system with 100,000 agents, as the dispersion parameter (k) decreases. the variance of the number of infections generated by each infectious individual increases. the mean is approximately constant at the input value of two. an individual in isolation or quarantine has his/her infectiousness reduced by a factor for the remainder of his/her disease. an individual under symptom monitoring is isolated DSM days after symptom onset. an individual under symptom monitoring

uninformative prior distribution of each parameter bounded by published observations, we simulate five infection generations of 500 initial individuals and record the simulated serial interval. partial rank correlation coefficients are calculated to identify the most influential disease characteristics (e.g., duration of infectiousness) and intervention performance metrics (e.g., isolation effectiveness) to maximize coverage of the parameter space, we allowed fractional parameters (, PCT, PINF, and k ) to range from zero to one, delays (DCT and DSM) to range from 0 to 7 d, R 0 to range from one to five, and the incubation period ( T I N C values of PINF 1 change the number of days in quarantine to d Q = ( d Q + T I N C 95 ( 1 / P I N F 1 ) the model simulates a branching network of infected individuals only. an individual i is assigned characteristics sampled from distributions defined for each disease. when 0 i d I N F i, i is defined by a piecewise function according to whether is in the period before the peak of infection ( i ) or is after the peak of infection. each piecewise component is divided by i, which is defined as the sum of infectiousness before the peak, at the peak, and after the peak. if 1, the number of infections generated per case will be overdispersed to simulate superspreading. each infection generated is assigned to a particular time drawn from a random sample 0, 1,..., d I N F i that is weighted by R i / R 0 i, so that hours of high infectiousness are more likely to have larger values of N i. isolation of individual j occurs a delay D S M days after symptom onset. isolation of individual j occurs a delay D S M days after symptom onset. isolation depends on whether symptom monitoring or quarantine is used. individual ends some time before (TOFFSET 0) or after (TOFFSET > 0) the onset of symptoms. we assume the distribution of relative infectiousness to follow a triangle distribution with a peak at time. the steps are as follows. weights are proportional to 1 / K S i. repeat steps ii\u2013viii until the median KS is within 10% of each of the previous two rounds. generation time distributions may change over the course of an epidemic. the expected number of onward infections by individual i, R 0 i, is distributed over each hour of disease R i = i R 0 i, where i is the relative infectiousness of individual i on hour since the onset of infectiousness. the total number of infections ( N i ) generated by individual i is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean equal to the total expected number of infections. if 1, the number of infections generated per case will be overdispersed to simulate superspreading. disease characteristics for individual j are drawn as above and set to begin at the time of infection of individual j. individual j is placed under symptom monitoring or quarantine after an operational lag time of D C T days. lag time occurs after the earlier of (i) isolation of individual i or (ii) removal of individual i from the disease system on recovery or death. individual j is under quarantine, then R t j is reduced by ( 1 ) beginning at the time that individual j is traced. the objective of this procedure is not explicitly parameter inference, for which raw data and disease-specific nuance are necessary. ii) Draw a parameter set i = 1. ii) run the branching epidemic model starting with 500 distinct infections under a situation with no interventions. use the two-sample ks.test function in R to calculate the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov ( K S i ) test statistic, comparing the empirical distribution of simulated serial intervals with the published serial interval distribution. bias would reduce the simulated effectiveness of all interventions."}
