{"summary": "adenoviruses are highly contagious pathogens that are associated with a wide spectrum of human illnesses involving the respiratory tract. the most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967); p 0.05. the dominant species in circulation in children with ILI appears to be HAdV-C and HAdV-B species. the circulation of though HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections. the illnesses range from influenza-like fever and discomfort to pneumonia and death. swabs are placed in 2-mL cryovials with viral transport medium. each sample is accompanied by a case report form collecting demographic and clinical data. the data obtained daily were entered into an Epi Info database. DNA/RNA are eluted with 60 l nuclease-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. a two-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX-96 thermocycler. PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 l. for each sample, PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 l. PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 l. Phylogenetic trees were performed in MEGA 6 software [15] using neighbor-joining method. the evolutionary distances were derived using the Tamura-Nei method. bootstrapping replicates with values 70 are shown on the trees. the patients included in this study were of all ages and consulted the sentinel sites due to influenza-like symptoms. the patients, or parents in the case of minors, accept the tests for respiratory viruses largely because they are free and safe. DNA/RNA are eluted with 60 l nuclease-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. a two-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX-96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer was used for amplifications. for each sample, PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 l. for each sample, PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 l. Phylogenetic trees were performed using the neighbor-joining method. the evolutionary distances were derived using the Tamura-Nei method. the information provided to participants was an informal description of the study. 6381 samples were collected from patients meeting case definition for ILI at different sentinel sites. more than half of patients were children of 5 years old followed by 5\u201310 years age group.

Detection rates over the study period are almost similar in the first 3 years (2012, 2013 and 2014) from 1967 adenovirus positive cases, 1561 (79.4%) were found in co-infection with at least one respiratory virus. most common were influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). cases of myalgia (P = 0.0014), cough (P = 0.0028), diarrhea (P 0.001), rhinitis (P 0.001) and headache (P = 0.01) are significantly higher in patients infected by adenoviruses. Fig 1 shows the temporal distribution of HAdV positivity rate per month in Senegal from 2012 to 2015. HAdV circulation pattern shows no seasonality even if results suggest a higher activity of these viruses during cold periods. 9 isolates grouped with HAdV-B species and the remaining isolate, from 2012, seems close to the HAdV- 4 genome type belonging to the HAdV-E species. in all cases bootstrap values are high (more than 85%) within the HAdV-C species, 16 Senegalese isolates are grouped with the type HAdV-6 (36.4%); 2 isolates with HAdV-2 type (4.5%), 4 with HAdV-5 the mean age was 10 years 11 months and median age was 4 years. more than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of 5 years old. more than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of 5 years old. myalgia 125(10.31) 327(21.53) 306(15.85) 302(17.57) 1060(16.6) Fever 1129(93.08) 1350(88.87) 1864(96.58) 1652(96.10) 5995(93.9) Cough 824(67.93) 1099(72.35) 1554(80.52) 1554(80.52) 1373(79.87) 4850 6381 specimens tested, 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV (Table 2). Detection rates are almost similar in the first 3 years (2012, 2013 and 2014) while in 2015 there is a marked decrease in adenoviral infections. from the 1967 adenovirus positive cases, 1561 (79.4%) were found in co-infection with at least one respiratory virus. most common were influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Fig 1 shows the temporal distribution of HAdV positivity rate per month in Senegal from 2012 to 2015. HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitude. the curve represents the total number of influenza-like Illness cases tested for adenovirus. bars represent proportions (rates) of adenovirus-positive cases for each month. some samples showed no amplification or poor-quality sequences. HAdV detected in patients with ILI in Senegal from 2012 to 2016. the last 300 nucleotides of the adenovirus hexon gene were amplified, sequenced, and compared to published sequences (in black) from GenBank using the neighbor-joining method. adenoviral detection does not necessarily prove disease causation as coincidental upper airway infection, asymptomatic viral carrier state, or prolonged shedding in a previous infection could explain adenoviral detection. adenoviral detection does not necessarily prove disease causation as coincidental upper airway infection, asymptomatic viral carrier state, or prolonged shedding [36] in a previous infection could explain adenoviral detection. 79.4% of HAdV infected participants were co-infected with one or more other respiratory tract viruses. the most frequently co-detected viruses were influenza viruses (53.1%), rhinoviruses (30%), enteroviruses (18.5%) and RSV (13.5%) the same observation was reported in diverse geographical contexts. HAdV-B species from Senegal clustered with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-7d, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 (88% bootstrap value) serotype has recently reemerged as a highly virulent pathogen, causing severe [64] and sometimes fatal pneumonia among immunocompetent adults. the results of the present study suggest strong year-round HAdV activity in Senegal, especially in children up to 5 years of age. we strongly suggest molecular surveillance and genotyping of newly detected HAdV strains in Senegal and even by whole genome sequencing. viral effective disease (or symptom) causality."}
