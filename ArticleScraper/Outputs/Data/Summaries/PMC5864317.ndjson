{"summary": "a rapid time-limited surveillance pilot for hospitalized cases was conducted in seven Canadian jurisdictions. it was conducted in response to outbreaks of an emerging respiratory pathogen enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) which affected mostly children. the pilot will help with future rapid surveillance initiatives. a non-polio enterovirus often causes mild symptoms such as a cold or fever. more severe respiratory symptoms such as wheezing may be reported in individuals, particularly children with a history of asthma or other pre-existing conditions. the outbreak in Canada caused severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization in over 200 children (3). PTs were invited to participate in the time-limited rapid surveillance pilot. the pilot was to collect select de-identified case-level data on severe cases of EV-D68 infection in Canada requiring hospitalization. PHAC\u2019s Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID), the NML, the Canadian Field Epidemiology Program and Health Canada\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch were also involved in the pilot. EV-D68 severe outcomes surveillance pilot Prior to the 2014 outbreak, illness due to EV-D68 was rare and the disease was not nationally notifiable. the goal of the pilot was to collect select de-identified case-level data on severe cases of EVD68 infection in Canada requiring hospitalization. data on hospitalized, laboratory-confirmed cases of EV-D68 were collected from September to October 2014. a surveillance summary of pediatric cases (=18 years of age) for the month of September 2014 was published in February 2015 (3). PHAC conducted a qualitative evaluation of the EV-D68 pilot in the spring of 2015. respondents were informed that if multiple survey responses per jurisdiction were received, responses would be weighted appropriately so as not to bias the results. the individuals involved in planning and managing the evaluation and those at the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) who created the data reporting platform did not participate in the survey as they were not among the target population. one survey respondent noted he/she did not participate in the pilot because EV-D68 was not a notifiable disease. at that time, some provincial public health laboratories did not have the capacity to test for EV-D68 or had limited provincial human resources available to participate. an epidemiological summary of the cases was provided at the end of the surveillance period. 62.5% of respondents found the summary report was \u2018useful\u2019 or \u2018very useful\u2019. the main reason was because the summary report was not representative of the national picture. more than half of respondents indicated that current processes should be improved in order to facilitate rapid surveillance initiatives within and across jurisdictions. the majority of respondents indicated that receiving timely case summaries from PHAC throughout the pilot process was important and weekly updates were preferred. twenty percent of respondents suggested that an inter-jurisdictional group could assess the need for and decide on setting up a new surveillance system. a similar proportion suggested that jurisdictions should place a priority on setting aggregate reporting of surveillance data to ensure timeliness of data reporting. the fall 2014 EV-D68 outbreak resulted in a small number of deaths and cases with neurological manifestations. the EV-D68 surveillance pilot provided PHAC and participating jurisdictions with an opportunity to test resource capacities for emerging respiratory pathogens surveillance. 75% of respondents indicated they were \u2018satisfied\u2019 or \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with the length of time it took to develop the pilot. the active surveillance period lasted six to eight weeks and included retrospective case ascertainment for the month of September. 62.5% of respondents found the summary report was 'useful' or'very useful' the third goal was to provide participating jurisdictions with options for creating real-time summary reports via CNPHI. of the jurisdictions that reported at least one case (n=4; all of whom completed the survey), only 50% used the case report form and only 25% used the CNPHI platform. half of respondents indicated that data-sharing agreements or protocols should be established prior to an outbreak. for example, ensure emerging pathogens are reportable conditions under PT communicable disease regulations. a majority of respondents indicated that receiving timely case summaries from PHAC throughout the pilot process was important. a summary of the key evaluation findings are noted in Table 1. were the goals of the EV-D68 surveillance pilot met. only four of the participating PTs were able to identify at least one case. the EV-D68 surveillance pilot provided PHAC and participating jurisdictions with an opportunity to test resource capacities and processes for emerging respiratory pathogens surveillance. the pilot objectives were met albeit with some shortcomings; there were important benefits to conducting surveillance of emerging pathogens. non-participating jurisdictions were asked to provide reasons for not participating. overall feedback from non-participating jurisdictions was lacking."}
