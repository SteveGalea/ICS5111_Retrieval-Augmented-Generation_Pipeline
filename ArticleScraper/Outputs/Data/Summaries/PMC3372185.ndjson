{"summary": "the origin of ACE2 utilization for cell entry by SARS-CoV has remained unclear. ACE2 utilization preceded the emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses in bats. analysis of rapid evolution has been used to test viral emergence hypothesis. a new truncated species of VP1/2 was identified that associates specifically with nuclear capsids and enhances their egress to the cytoplasm. a new truncated species of VP1/2 actively displaces the truncated species, covering cytoplasmic capsids with domains necessary for further tegument assembly. control of grapevine pathogens."}
