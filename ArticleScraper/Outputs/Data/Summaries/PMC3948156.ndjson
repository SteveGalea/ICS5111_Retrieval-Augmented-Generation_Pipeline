{"summary": "despite promises, it is difficult even in animal models to demonstrate that any of the proposed murine PSCs can rebuild organs, contributing not only to fragments of parenchyma but also to vessels, nerves and lymphatics. we should pursue all possibilities and alternative approaches to finding such cells, combine our efforts without hostility and unnecessary competition and leave aside financial interests related to patents, company stock and funding by private investors or government agencies. we fear that a vested financial interests in induced PSC and embryonic stem cell technology could be a competitive topic. despite these claims, we prefer not to comment on the insinuation that the Vatican is using VSELs to try to control science. we will review the most important concepts supporting the existence of VSELs in adult tissues. in adult murine and human tissues there are rare stem cells that express early-development markers and are endowed with broader differentiation potential. in most of these reports, the stem cell that differentiated into cells from different germ layers has not been directly identified at the single-cell level. we believe that many of us studying stem cells residing in adult tissues that display early-development markers and are endowed with broader differentiation potential. adult tissues harbor a population of very rare stem cells with multiple tissue differentiation potential. these dormant, early-development cells show several epiblast/germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin/deposition and relationship to early epiblast-derived migrating primordial germ cells. the germline potential is established in the fertilized oocyte (zygote) and subsequently retained in the morula, inner cell mass of the blastocyst (iCM), EPSC, PGCs and mature germline cells (oocytes and sperm) the germline potential is established in the fertilized oocyte (zygote) and subsequently retained in the morula, inner cell mass of the blastocyst (iCM), EPSC, PGCs and murine BM-purified VSELs possess several in vitro features expected from PSCs. a similar mechanism based on erasure of imprinting also regulates the quiescent state of PGCs. methylation studies show their association with histone codes that promote transcription. 69 The PGC-specific genes, such as Dppa2, Dppa4 and Mvh, are characteristic of late-migratory PGCs. the expression of some of these crucial genes has been confirmed by demonstrating the presence of transcriptionally active promoters. one of the mechanisms that keep VSELs quiescent in adult tissues is similar to that that governs quiescence of PGCs. a 10-day administration of all these sex hormones directly stimulated expansion of VSELs and HSCs in BM. this was measured by an increase in the total number of these cells in BM (2\u20133x) and enhanced 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. the percentage of quiescent BrdU+Sca-1+LinCD45+ HSCs increased from 24% to 43\u201358%). murine and human BM, UCB and adult solid organs were cultured and expanded in vitro. if they expanded into cells from different tissues, they were assigned various operational names such as multipotent adult stem cells,36 multipotent adult progenitor cells,39 MIAMI cells,37 multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells76, 79 or unrestricted somatic stem cells. cells that express Oct4+ sorted from rat BM gave rise in vivo to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in an experimental model of rodent acute myocardial infarction. this bone-forming activity exceeded the activity of other populations of BM-purified cells that were evaluated using the same assay. 83 small non-hematopoietic Sca-1+ Lin CD45 cells Isolated by FACS from rat bone marrow as SSEA+ Lin CD45 cells that express Oct-4. these cells are endowed with cardiomyogenic and endothelial potential. 85, 86 UCB VSELs small Oct-4+, SSEA-4+, Nanog+, Sox-2+, Rex-1+, and Tert+ cells isolated from UCB. 15, 23, 46, 84 Omnicytes Small Oct-4+ stem-cells identified in UCB, able to establish fetal\u2013maternal chimerism. a similar population of small non-hematopoietic CD45 stem cells harvested from BM via elutriation was recently shown to differentiate in vivo into functional insulin-producing cells in chemically induced diabetic mice. however, similar small cells isolated by elutriation were reported in the past to give rise to LT-HSCs. so, VSELs and VSEL-resembling cells have recently been purified in several laboratories worldwide. yanishi et al.29 may explain the loss of VSELs and subsequent negative results that this group reported. the authors' intention was to enlarge the gate into Lindim objects to increase VSEL yield. this step may in fact greatly enrich the sorted population in erythroblasts and thus dilute the VSELs. 'VSEL candidates' consist of large cells (>10 m) with high Syto16-related signals (interpreted by the authors as normal, 2n cells, original Figure 1C29 and shown here as Figure 2a, blue box) however, we consider the fraction of smaller cells (FCSlow) appearing as Sytox16dim cells (originally Figure 1C29 and shown as Figure 2a, blue box) to represent potential VSELs because of their well-known low cytoplasmic content. Flow cytometric concerns regarding VSEL identification and isolation. we have a general concern about Sytox-Blue and Sytox16 staining in this study because unfractionated BM cells do not contain any debris or dead cells. danova-Alt et al.,27 in their recent studies focusing on human VSEL isolation, concluded that CD45/Lin/CD133+ cells do not exist in CB. such cells are not only found in our samples (lower dot plots, VSELs marked with blue boxes), but also in some CB samples (1, 2 and 3) analyzed by Danova-Alt et al. images of selected murine cell populations used for size calculation by imaging cytometry. FlowSight-derived brightfield images of CD45/int/Lin/Sca-1+/Sytox16+ objects were isolated as \u2018VSEL candidates\u2019 by Miyanishi et al. the right panel shows representative images of murine VSELs (CD45/Lin/Sca-1+/7-AAD+ cells), HSCs (CD45+/Lin/Sca-1+/7-AAD+ cells) and platelets (CD41+/7-AAD+ objects) obtained with the ImageStream 100 system and used for VSEL size analysis. danova-Alt et al.,27 based on their uncertain-quality fluorescent in situ hybridization staining with probes directed to only selected chromosomes, concluded that human UCB-derived CD45/Lin/CXCR4+ cells display a high degree of aneuploidy. in contrast, we verified the karyotype of human UCB-derived CD45/Lin/CD133+ cells (which they in fact consider wrongly to be V both CD45/Lin/CD34+ and CD45/Lin/CD133+ cells are present in at least some UCB samples analyzed by Danova-Alt et al.,27. the authors instead of using for CD133 staining as we recommended in our original protocols antibodies against CD133/1 epitope100 employed not optimized for VSEL isolation an anti-CD133/2 eiptope antibody. the entire fraction of CD45/Lin/Sca-1+/c-kit/KDR was excluded from further sorting because it was deemed \u2018apoptotic\u2019. the entire fraction of CD45/Lin/Sca-1+/c-kit/KDR was excluded by the authors from further sorting because it was deemed \u2018apoptotic\u2019. we plan to highlight these methodological aspects in a separate paper focusing exclusively on flow cytometric pitfalls and techniques in rare stem cell characterization, including for VSELs. this approach was related to our sorting protocols suggesting standard-sized beads for gate set-up. however, when it was already clear from their initial experiments, the authors continued the size comparison, which was in fact irrelevant to the final sorting outcome. SELs should be sought in the fraction of objects between 4 and 6 m or even between 4 and 8 m rather than 4 m. the authors performed redundant comparisons between instruments,29 when it is common flow cytometric knowledge that the distribution of both synthetic beads and cells will vary between different instruments. the authors concluded that classical flow cytometry is not a reliable method for cell-size analysis and may vary between instruments. a gate enclosing Lin/Sca-1+ cells to avoid erythroblast contamination was reported in the paper by Szade et al.,28 the group that significantly modified sorting and eventually isolated a murine BM cell population distinctly different from VSELs. the gating for sorting was performed in an untidy fashion, and very small cells were lost at different steps28. agranular, small events ranging from 2 to 10 m are included in an \u2018extended lymphgate' on an FSC vs SSC dot plot (region R1; a) cells from region R1 may be additionally depleted of doublets (gate R2; b) to enhance sorting purity (b) FlowSight (amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) is not an optimal choice for morphological examination of very small objects such as VSELs. FlowSight is capable of analyzing a majority of large cells with its single 20 objective and fixed optical configuration,105 it cannot provide images of VSELs of the quality required for reliable image processing. FlowSight acquisition, even for human VSELs, would not be easily visible on a FlowSight instrument because of its limitations in object resolution. FlowSight, with its standard optics pixel resolution of 2 m, still lacks sufficient resolution for accurate VSEL size measurements. a large-cell population was analyzed excluding the Sytox16dim fraction that resembled \u2018VSEL candidates\u2019 (major concern), (4) no information was provided about the analytical approach, including the type of masking or the features used for size calculation. a small number of objects was analyzed and (6) the preparation of cells before analysis was different than in our previously reported studies. the authors carelessly excluded potentially crucial objects (4-5 m in size based on their unknown masking and diameter measurements) from size analysis in the CD45/Lin/Sca-1+/c-kit fraction, which could contain VSELs, was not professionally performed. this underscores the importance of a skilled and knowledgeable flow cytometry-skilled operator who can fully understand and interpret data generated by this state-of-the-art machine. we have always emphasized that, in contrast to their murine counterparts, much work still needs to be done to better characterize human VSELs. we have always emphasized that much work still needs to be done to better characterize human VSELs."}
