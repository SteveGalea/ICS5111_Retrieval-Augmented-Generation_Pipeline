{"summary": "the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV mediates receptor-binding but also induces neutralizing antibodies. we previously identified the receptor-binding domain of S protein as a major target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models. however, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD in humans need to be characterized. the -binding domain (RBD) of S protein was defined as a fragment corresponding to the residues 318 - 510 of the S protein. it mediates viral binding to cell receptor ACE2 [13-15]. the antigenicity and protective efficacy of RBD-based vaccine candidates have been evaluated in animal models [17,23-25]. culture medium was replaced by fresh OPTI-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium. supernatants expressing RBD proteins were collected 72 h later. reactivity of SARS serum samples or purified anti-RBD antibodies with recombinant RBD protein was determined by ELISA. the anti-RBD antibodies were eluted in 0.2 M glycine-HCl buffer. the buffer was exchanged with PBS by several cycles of dilution. the anti-RBD antibodies were sterilized with 0.2-m pore size microspin filters. the pseudovirus was preincubated with serially diluted anti-RBD at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before addition to cells. the culture was re-fed with fresh medium 12 h later and incubated for an additional 48 h. cells were washed with PBS and lysed using lysis reagent. culture medium was replaced by fresh OPTI-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium 12 h post-transfection. supernatants expressing RBD proteins were collected 72 h later. reactivity of SARS serum samples or purified anti-RBD antibodies with recombinant RBD protein was determined by ELISA. anti-RBD antibodies were eluted in 0.2 M glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5. the buffer was exchanged with PBS by several cycles of dilution. the eluates were immediately neutralized with Tris buffer, pH 2.5. the pseudovirus was preincubated with purified anti-RBD at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before addition to cells. the culture was re-fed with fresh medium 12 h later and incubated for an additional 48 h. cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer plates. the results showed that the S protein RBD is highly immunogenic in the recovered SARS-CoV infected patients. the convalescent sera from 30 SARS patients and normal sera from 25 healthy blood donors were tested at 1/100 dilution by ELISA. the viral lysate-based ELISA kit had much low sensitivity than the viral lysate-based ELISA kit. the sera were tested at 1/100 dilution by ELISA with RBD-His protein as a coating antigen or by the viral lysate-based diagnostic kit. a panel of 35 convalescent sera collected from the SARS patients 30 - 60 days after onset of illness were previously used for mapping the antigenic sites of SARS-CoV. we used the purified RBD-His protein as a coating antigen in ELISA to detect RBD-specific antibodies in these SARS serum samples. the sequential blood samples were collected from 19 recovered SARS patients enrolled for a follow-up study. the serum samples were tested at 100-fold dilutions for RBD-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA with RBD-His as a coating antigen or by the viral lysate-based diagnostic kit. the fusion protein RBD-Fc was coupled to cyanogenbromide-activated Sepharose beads. the serum sample was flowed through the bead column to absorb the RBD-specific antibodies. all four purified human RBD-specific antibodies potently neutralized infection by SARS pseudoviruses. s can induce potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity [16,17,23-25,29,30,34]. based on these observations we have proposed RBD-based SARS vaccines [20-22]. however, our previous studies were primarily based on the animal models. the immunogenicity of RBD immunogens will be evaluated in non-human primates. the average OD values dropped to 0.25 by year 3 and gave a positive rate of 55.56% [35] consistent with the present results. the viral lysate-based ELISA kit can be further explored as the RBD specifically mediates receptor-binding. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
