{"summary": "the most common approach for producing hybridomas has been to fuse B cells from mice hyper-immunized with the antigen with a myeloma B cell line lacking hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) the fusion mixture is then seeded into 96-well plates and the hybridomas are selected with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) containing medium. antigen-coated ELISA wells generally can\u2019t distinguish antibodies that recognize the native vs. denatured form of antigen protein. absorption to ELISA plates denatures some of the protein due to the hydrophobic interaction between the plate surface and protein. native OVA protein was obtained by dissolving OVA in PBS. native OVA protein was obtained by collecting monomeric OVA peak from a superdex 200 size column. antibodies were dissolved at 50g/ml in 50mM sodium acetate pH5.0. surface of CM5 was activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/ethyl (dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) each antibody was then injected into a different channel of a CM5 chip. live cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. 2JLO-5 cell which secretes IgG1 antibody against native OVA was also stained as a positive control for gating purpose. a serial dilution of S212 hybridoma cells was incubated at 37\u00b0C. cells were discarded and plate washed with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. AKP conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a or IgG2b antibody was then added. ified B cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. cell lysate was loaded on to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Ig antibody. AKP conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a or IgG2b specific antibodies were from BD Pharmingen. anti-mouse IgG subclass antibodies were immobilized in flowcells of a CM5 chip. each one of four antibodies was then injected into a different channel of a CM5 chip. 8000 RU of antibody was immobilized on each channel. hybridoma cell lines were stained with 2 g/ml goat anti mouse heavy chain Fc region isotype specific antibody or control antibody. staining was carried out on ice for 15 minutes. AKP conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a or IgG2b antibody was then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. AKP conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a or IgG2b antibody was then added. antibody secreting cells from 2b antibody secreting hybridoma cells 10 million S212 cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibody. the recovered cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b antibody. a hybridoma supernatant containing an IgG mAb is captured only in the well with the appropriate anti-Fc specificity. the other flowcells act as negative controls for non-specific binding and the fluid phase SPR signal from the culture supernatant. HO14 and HO1 are both IgG1 mAbs produced from OVA-immunized mice. they were previously scored to bind to OVA protein coated on standard ELISA plates. however, when these mAbs were captured via their Fc, subsequently injected native OVA bound to the HO1 mAb. this showed that the HO14 epitope was not present on the native OVA protein. Fig 2D shows standard sandwich ELISA data using wells coated with purified H71 mAb to capture various concentrations of MBP. this type data can allow for the rapid identification of pairs of mAbs that can be useful in developing a sandwich ELISA assay. identify the S161 mAb as a potential therapeutic mAb. the robustness of the goat anti-IgG Fc reagents allows the flowcells to be stripped of the captured mAb\u2019s and antigen with a low pH (10mM glycine buffer, pH 1.7) wash without significant damage to the immobilized anti-Fc reagent. a single BIAsensor chip can be used for hundreds of experiments. a previously single cell cloned hybridoma cell line, S161, began to lose IgG secretion in culture over time. a previously single cell cloned hybridoma cell line, described above, began to lose IgG secretion in culture over time. however, after sorting the hybridoma cells with or without surface IgG expression, only those clones that secreted antibody had surface IgG expression. gG expression is preferred over other genetically upstream isotypes. it has been reported that switching of heavy chains to downstream isotypes in mouse hybridoma cell lines occurs at an extremely low, but detectable rate. we used the finding that the presence of surface IgG on hybridomas correlated with their secreted IgG. gG 2a antibody secreting hybridoma cells from an IgG 2b hybridoma cell line with ELISPOT. the most time consuming process in making mAbs is selection and cloning hybridomas from a bulk culture. cloned and rescreened before the overgrowth of the desired mAb producing hybridoma cells by other HAT resistant cells in the culture well. we used fluorescent anti-mouse IgG antibodies with fluorescent antigen to single cell sort antigen-specific hybridoma cells from a fusion bulk mixture directly targeting native antigen specific hybridomas. single cell sorted one plate of surface IgG positive, but only one secreted antibody binding the native OVA. this hybridoma cell was later found to be positively stained by OVA. the sorting of this hybridoma cell might be due to a system error. hybridomas secrete both IgG 1 and 2a antibodies. both bind native vs. denatured forms of protein antigens. we used Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology with a BIAcore. the blue curve represents signal of the anti-IgG 2b channel subtracted by the anti-IgG 2c channel. the dissociation rate (Kd) and association rate (Ka) between HO1 antibody and native OVA protein were calculated. we used the BIAcore system to determine whether these mAbs recognize the same or different epitopes on the antigen protein. when tested separately all three mAbs bound the native MBP. the MBP bound to the H71 mAb subsequently failed to bind the H22 mAb. S161 and 2A8 are two IgG2a mAbs specific for the Spike protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) they must bind to a receptor or ligand epitope that lies within the interface of the interaction. the results identify the S161 mAb as a potential therapeutic mAb for blocking the interaction of the SARS-CoV with its cellular receptor. hybridomas were produced with the Sp2/0 myeloma fusion partner. we successfully stained the cells with various fluorescent anti-IgG reagents. we also demonstrated the presence of the membrane form of the heavy chain mRNA in the hybridomas. expression on mouse hybridoma cells correlates with secreted mAbs of same isotype. others suggest antigen specific hybridomas are more stable antibody secretors. IgG2a+/IgG2b cells were undetectable by direct flow cytometry. but by using an antibody specific for IgG2a, we were able to enrich them with magnetic beads to the point that the cells could now be identified with flow cytometry and single-cell sorted to produce clones. starting with 10 million S212 cells, we sorted 18 IgG2a cells, 12 of which grew into colonies, all of which secreted IgG2 cells are distributed into multiple microculture plates at a dilution estimated to produce less than one HAT resistant hybridoma per well. problems can arise when a miscalculation of the cell dilution results in wells with multiple HAT resistant hybridomas, only one of which is secreting the desired mAb. cells positive for both antibodies occurred with a frequency of less 0.3% of the live cell population. single double positive cells were sorted into individual culture wells of three microculture plates. after 10 days supernatants of the resulting colonies were tested for OVA specific IgG secretion.
