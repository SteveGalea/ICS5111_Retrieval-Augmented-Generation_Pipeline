{"summary": "a novel influenza virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged in April 2009 and spread rapidly, primarily through humantohuman transmission. it mostly affected younger people with 60% of patients under 18 years of age, suggesting possible preexisting immunity in the elderly. 4 Few studies performed extensive respiratory testing beyond influenza during the pandemic. 9, 15, 16, 20, 21 This study enrolled community patients presenting with (ILI) to a community sentinel network during the influenza pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 in Ontario, Canada. this study documented the profile of respiratory viruses causing ILI symptoms. time to sample collection was calculated as the difference between sample collection and symptom onset dates. chronic condition defined as heart/lung/renal/metabolic/blood/immune conditions or conditions that compromise the management of respiratory secretions and increase risk of aspiration. study population data were collected as part of a multiprovincial case\u2013control sentinel network study. each sentinel would submit an average of 1\u20132 samples per week from their clinical practice during the study period, April 21, 2009 to February 25, 2010. this study was approved by the University of Toronto\u2019s ethics board. all patients gave verbal consent to participate. each sample represents one patient. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 668 (656%) of the samples. influenza A was the most frequent accounting for 452 (544%) followed by enterovirus/rhinovirus 194 (233%) and RSV 120 (144%). a single virus was detected in 512 (503%) samples. 304 (594%) were influenza A and 208 (406%) were other respiratory viruses. peaks for single infection occurred in June and September 2009. enza 2 5 (10) Parainfluenza 3 11 (06) Parainfluenza subtotal 31 (61) Respiratory Syncytial A 9 (18) Respiratory Syncytial B 3 (06) Respiratory Syncytial B 3 (06) Respiratory Syncytial subtotal 12 (24) Coronavirus 229E/NL63* 4 (08) Coronavirus OC43 2 (04) Coronavirus subtotal 7 (14) Adenovirus 5 (10) 5 spiratory Syncytial B 100 (641) Influenza A/Enterovirus/rhinovirus 34 (218) Parainfluenza 1/Enterovirus/rhinovirus 5 (32) Influenza A/Parainfluenza 1/Enterovirus/rhinovirus /Respiratory Syncytial 4 (26) Influenza A/Parainfluenza 1/Enterovirus/rhinovirus 2 (13) Influenza A/Para 374% had no virus detected, 448% had single infections, and 178% had coinfections. among the 795 participants without comorbidities, the distribution was 336%, 518%, and 146%, respectively. median number of days from symptom onset to sample collection was two. patients with single and coinfections were more likely to have a single infection compared to those with no infection. patients under 30 years of age were more likely to have coinfections compared with patients 65 and over. patients n = 1014 Single infection n = 512 (502%) Coinfection n = 156 (153%) n (%) Crude OR OR (95%CI) Adjusted OR (95%CI) Age category (years) 65+ 62 15 (242) 100 100 9 (145) 100 100 0\u20134 102 51 (500) 461 (216\u2013981)* 483 (222\u20131048)* 23 (226) 346 (139\u2013863)* 438 (164\u20131167) at least one respiratory virus was detected in 668 (656%) of the samples. influenza A was the most frequent accounting for 452 (544%) followed by enterovirus/rhinovirus 194 (233%) and RSV 120 (144%). peaks in detection for influenza A occurred in June and October 2010, for enterovirus/rhinovirus in September 2010 and for RSV in October 2010. peaks in detection for influenza A occurred in June and October 2010, for enterovirus/rhinovirus in September 2010 and for RSV in October 2010. 304 (594%) were influenza A and 208 (406%) were other respiratory viruses, the most common being enterovirus/rhinovirus. peaks for single infection occurred in June and September 2009. the most common coinfections were influenza A/RSV B and influenza A/enterovirus/rhinovirus, responsible for 641% and 218% of coinfections. the highest proportion of coinfection was detected in October, corresponding with peak activity of influenza A and RSV. ovirus 1 (06) Influenza A/Respiratory Syncytial A 1 (06) Influenza A/Respiratory Syncytial B /Parainfluenza 2 1 (06) Parainfluenza 2/Parainfluenza 3 1 (06) Total 156 (100) *All influenza A samples were influenza A/(H1N1) pdm09 except 15 samples which were unable to subtype due to low viral load. Enterovirus the distribution was 363%, 528%, and 11%. among those collected within 3\u20137 days, the distribution was 363%, 528%, and 11%, which was statistically significant. patients with single and coinfections were compared to those with no infection. the highest likelihood was observed in children 5\u201314 years of age. patients under 30 years of age were more likely to have coinfections. 483 (222\u20131048)* 23 (226) 346 (139\u2013863)* 438 (164\u20131167)* 5\u201314 197 115 (584) 662 (331\u20131321)* 703 (344\u20131435)* 38 (193) 364 (156\u2013850)* 479 (191\u20131203)* 15\u201329 283 148 (523) 441 (229\u2013848)* 456 (232\u2013896)* 50 (177) 248 (110\u2013556)* 332 ( 66% of samples tested during the 2009 pandemic in Ontario had at least one virus detected and 15% had coinfections. the findings are consistent with reports from other studies with the range of coinfection reported from 7\u201327%. pdm09/RSV was more common than A(H1N1)pdm09/enterovirus/rhinovirus, accounting for 641% and 228% of the coinfections. this may reflect the younger age of patients infected by A(H1N1)pdm09, who were therefore also at greater risk of RSV. patients with chronic conditions are at higher risk of severe disease and consequently may be more likely to seek medical care. 26 Selection bias is unlikely to influence these results as the proportion of patients with comorbidities was similar to that in Ontario\u2019s population (203%). conflict of interest DMS was Principal Investigator on clinical trial of pediatric influenza vaccine dose response for which influenza vaccine was provided free.
