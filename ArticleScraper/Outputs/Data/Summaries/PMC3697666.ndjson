{"summary": "TEXT Duck tembusu virus (DTMUV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. it encodes three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. since 2010, a novel DTMUV has caused a substantial drop in egg production in infected birds in southeast china. cDNA clone was amplified by PCR with concurrent introduction of a pFastBac1 vector. Isolated recombinant bacmid DNA and pFastBac DNA were used to transfect Sf9 cells according to manufacturer's instructions. membranes were probed with phosphatase-labeled goat anti-duck IgG conjugates (1:500 dilution) and phosphatase-labeled goat anti-duck IgG conjugates (1:500 dilution) we found that there are two potential N-linked glycosylated sites. the amount of expressed E protein in the supernatants was lower than that in pellets. sera were collected 2 weeks after the final boost. 30 DTMUV-positive and -negative sera were used to evaluate the E-ELISA. SN titers were calculated by the Reed-Muench method. the 30 DTMUV-positive animals showed a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:640. the 30 DTMUV-negative sera and the sera against the other duck pathogens showed no cross-reaction to DTMUV (1.5) to standardize the E-ELISA, the DTMUV-positive or -negative sera and conjugate dilution were used to optimize the detection system. the detection threshold of the E-ELISA compared to that of the SN test was determined by using serial dilutions of the DTMUV-positive sera. the negative-control sera showed no detectable E- or virus-specific antibodies in the E-ELISA or the SN test at any dilution. the results of the SN test and the dot blotting assays were in agreement for 409 samples. but 30 dot blotting serum-negative samples were positive in the SN test. 15 SN serum-negative samples were positive in the dot blotting assay. the 5 ng/well of recombinant E protein chosen for the E-ELISA was highly correlated (96.9%) with those of the SN tests. this recombinant E protein seems to be a suitable antigen to detect specific antibodies to tembusu virus in ducks."}
