{"summary": "RSV is a very important viral respiratory pathogen in infants, children and adult patients with immunodeficiency or cardiopulmonary disease. it starts with typical common-cold like symptoms but may progress to serious lower respiratory tract infections associated with a high rate of hospitalization of infants, children and elderly. no vaccines or therapeutics are available except for Synagis\u00ae\u00ae, also known as the humanized antibody palivizumab. the two mucin-like regions serve as excellent targets for RSV evolution studies. for RSV-A, the genotypes GA1-7, SAA1-2, NA1-4 and ON1 have been defined. the GB1-5, SAB1-4, URU1-2, BA1-12 and THB are reported. most of the published research on RSV was performed using the laboratory strains RSV-Long and RSV A2 which were isolated from the population in 1956 and 1961. they have been serially passaged in cell culture, which may have resulted in an accumulation of mutations that benefit the virus to grow in cell culture. hep-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in clear 96 well plates (Falcon) one day prior to infection. cells were washed with DMEM without iFBS (DMEM-0) and infected with 50 L of a 1/10 dilution series made in DMEM-0. cells were stained with palivizumab and stained with palivizumab. hep-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in a clear 96 well plate. samples were vortexed for one minute with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Mo, USA) before inoculating HEp-2 cells with 50 L of a 14 dilution series of the sample, made in DMEM-0. after 2 h of incubation, 50 L of DMEM containing iF hMPV, Rhinovirus 1 and 3, PIV 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, Paraechovirus, Enterovirus 68 and Bocavirus found negative for all. virus cultures tested negative on mycoplasma presence and no signs of bacterial or fungal presence. the reaction was run on a Real-time PCR machine (Stratagene, Mx3000P, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 \u00b0C and 1 min at 55 \u00b0C. the reaction was run on a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) primers were added to the reaction mix consisting of 10 L 5 RT-PCR buffer, 2 L dNTP, 2 L enzyme, 20 L H2O to a final amount of 30 pmol. cDNA was delivered to the VIB Neuromics support facility (University of Antwerp) for PCR cleanup and DNA sequencing. infectious Virus Production HEp-2, A549 and BEAS-2B cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. clinical RSV and RSV A2 were diluted to infect the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 0.01. aliquots of clinical isolates and RSV A2 and RSV B1 were thawed, diluted in DMEM-0 to obtain a starting concentration of 1 105 PFU/mL. aliquots were stored at 4 \u00b0C, at 32 \u00b0C or at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, snap frozen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until quantification was performed. DAPI staining was performed to stain the nuclei (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in a clear 96-well plate (Falcon) 24 h prior to inoculation. cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in a clear 96-well plate (Falcon) inoculum was replaced by DMEM-10 and was incubated for an additional 48 h. the still adherent cells were lysed with lysis buffer from the nucleospin kit. the solution was thoroughly mixed and frozen at \u201380 \u00b0C. image analysis was done using Zeiss ZEN 2.3 blue edition imaging software and ImageJ version 2.0.0-rc-43/1.50e. Statistical analysis Data for viral replication kinetics, infectious virus production and thermal stability are presented as means ( SEM) of indicated independent repeats. HEp-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in clear 96 well plates (Falcon) one day prior to mucosal extraction, cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in a clear 96 well plate. cells were washed with DMEM without iFBS (DMEM-0) and infected with 50 L of a 1/10 dilution series made in DMEM-0. samples were vortexed for one minute with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Mo, USA) before inoculating HEp-2 cells with 50 L of a 14 dilution series of the sample, made in DMEM-0. after 2 h of incubation with the inoculum at 37 \u00b0C, 50 L of DMEM containing iFBS, antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin), moxiflox hMPV, Rhinovirus 1 and 3, PIV 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, Paraechovirus, Enterovirus 68 and Bocavirus found negative for all. no signs of bacterial or fungal presence was observed when cultures were test grown in absence of antibiotics and anti-fungals. the reaction was run on a Real-time PCR machine (Stratagene, Mx3000P, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 \u00b0C and 1 min at 55 \u00b0C. RNA of the G gene was transcribed to cDNA and amplified using the one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) the PCR was performed in a thermocycler (Unocycler, VWR; Radnor, PA, USA) with the following program: 30 min at 50 \u00b0C for the RT step, 15 min at 95 \u00b0C for PCR activation, 40 amplification cycles consisting of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. -2B cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in black 96 well plates. the cells were washed with DMEM-0 and then infected with clinical isolates and RSV A2 and RSV B1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. aliquots were made of each sample in DMEM-0 to obtain a starting concentration of 1 105 PFU/mL. the other aliquots were stored at 4 \u00b0C, at 32 \u00b0C or at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until quantification was performed. DAPI staining was performed to stain the nuclei (Sigma-Ald palivizumab was diluted 1/40 and further in a 12 dilution series. inoculum was replaced with DMEM-10 containing 0.6% Avicel\u00ae. cells were permeabilized with triton X-100, stained with palivizumab antibody. cells were infected with a MOI of 0.1 for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (5% CO2) the nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel; D\u00fcren, Germany) was mixed and frozen at \u201380 \u00b0C. RNA isolation was done following manufacturer\u2019s instructions of the nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) data was analysed with a two-way ANOVA to determine the significance between the clinical isolates and the reference (RSV A2 or B1) data for plaque reduction represents means ( SD) significance was calculated between clinical isolates and references with a one-way ANOVA. phylogenetic trees for RSV-A and RSV-B sequences are shown in Figure 1A,B. phylogenetic trees of the G gene of all samples were obtained. trees were constructed with maximum-likelihood with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA X software. the trees are based on a 342nt and 330nt fragment of the G protein of RSV-A (A) and RSV-B (B) strains respectively, consisting of the second hypervariable region. three strains (BE/ANT-A21/17, BE/ANT-A7/17, BE/ANT-A8/17) replicated more slowly than the RSV A2 at 48 h. infection with a MOI of 0.01 resulted in infection values between 0.5% and 1% infected cells after 24 h. HEp-2 cells were infected with clinical isolates and RSV reference strains A2 and B1 after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. the same experiment was repeated in the A549 cell line in which for the RSV-A isolates the RSV A2 shows the highest percentage of infected cells. the isolate BE/ANT-B2/17 achieved again the lowest number of infected cells and levels of virus production in A549 cells. cultures were fixed after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h and stained with pAb goat-anti-RSV antibody. the amount of infectious virus released by the cells was the highest for RSV A2 and clinical isolate BE/ANT-A11/17. Isolates BE/ANT-B2/17 and BE/ANT-B15/17 had the lowest infection rates and infectious virus production. two clinical isolates of the RSV-B subtype replicated very efficiently in all cell lines and quite well in BEAS-2B. differences in infection kinetics were observed among the different clinical isolates. clinical isolates, RSV A2 and RSV B1 were aliquoted and exposed to 37 \u00b0C (A,B), 32 \u00b0C (C,D) or 4\u00b0C (E,F) one aliquot of each was snap frozen at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. the smallest syncytia were produced by BE/ANT-A12/17. mean syncytium frequencies lie between 16% and 21%. the lowest frequency found for BE/ANT-A10/17 suggested that it promotes the formation of larger syncytia rather than many small syncytia. palivizumab was incubated with a two-fold dilution series of palivizumab for 1h at 37 \u00b0C and then transferred to HEp-2 cells for 2h at 37 \u00b0C to allow infection of non-neutralized virus. DMEM-10 containing 0.6% Avicel\u00ae and incubated for three days until plaques were visible to the naked eye. mRNA expression levels of mucins 1, 4, 5AC and 5B in infected A549 cells were assessed by infecting a549 cells for 48 h with a MOI of 0.1. inoculum was replaced with DMEM-10 and cells were incubated for 48 h. expression profiles of the cell-tethered MUC4 show a relative increase compared to the negative control. infection of BE/ANT-A1/16 and BE/ANT-A11/17 resulted in the highest relative increases of MUC4 mRNA among the RSV-B clinical isolates. RSV-A was detected in one sample of December 2016 and in 11 samples collected between October 2017 and January 2018. of the remaining two RSV-negative samples, one tested positive for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), one remained negative for RSV, hMPV and Rhinovirus 1. cultures that showed syncytium formation were used to grow the virus on HEp-2 cells. phylogenetic trees were constructed with maximum-likelihood with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA X software. the trees are based on a 342nt and 330nt fragment of the G protein of RSV-A (A) and RSV-B (B) strains respectively. all RSV-A sequences cluster within the ON1 genotype that contains a 72nt duplication and all RSV-B sequences contain a 60nt duplication in the G-gene. all RSV-B sequences contain a 60nt duplication in the G-gene, further differentiated into the BA genotype. HEp-2 cells were infected with clinical isolates and RSV reference strains A2 and B1 after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. hep-2 cells were infected with clinical isolates and RSV reference strains. supernatants were collected and used for quantification by conventional plaque assay. data represents mean values SEM (n = 3), significant differences compared to reference strains are indicated by *p 0.05; ***p 0.001 (two-way ANOVA) the same experiment was repeated in the A549 cell line in which for the RSV-A isolates the highest percentage of infected cells. after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, nuclei were visualized with DAPI. permeabilized and stained with pAb goat-anti-RSV antibody and AF488 donkey-anti-goat (IgG) BEAS-2B cells were infected with clinical isolates and RSV reference strains A2 and B1. cultures were fixed after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, permeabilized and stained with pAb goat-anti-RSV antibody and AF488 donkey-anti-goat. Aliquots of each virus containing 1105 PFU/mL were incubated at three different temperatures for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for plaque assay. hep-2 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.05 and incubated for 48 h. cells were fixed, fluorescently stained and analysed with fluorescence microscopy. mean syncytium size of all RSV-A clinical isolates lies between four and seven nuclei per cell. tia with a mean size of 13 compared to all clinical isolates. reference strains A2 and B1 formed almost no syncytia. inoculum was replaced by DMEM-10 containing 0.6% Avicel\u00ae. s were visible to the naked eye to determine the concentration of palivizumab that neutralizes the virus by 50%. s were counted to determine the concentration of palivizumab that neutralizes the virus by 50%. A549 cells were infected with a MOI of 0.1 of clinical isolates and reference strains for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. inoculum was replaced with DMEM-10 and cells were incubated for 48 h. qRT-PCR followed by primers for different mucin-encoding genes. infection of isolates BE/ANT-B13/17 and BE/ANT-B20/17 resulted in the highest increase of MUC4 mRNA expression among the RSV-B isolates. expression of MUC5AC is significantly reduced upon infection with all clinical isolates and reference strains. the clinical isolate BE/ANT-B20/17 was genotyped and characterized on their ability to grow and produce infectious virus in cell lines. thermal stability was assessed at 37 \u00b0C (normal body temperature, incubation temperature), 32 \u00b0C (estimated nasal temperature) and 4 \u00b0C (storage temperature), fusion capacity and neutralization by palivizumab. all clinical isolates have the ability to infect all cell lines tested. differences could be due to genetic differences that could affect antiviral responses in the cells. the thermal stability of the clinical isolates is in general lower than the reference strains. the amount of infectious virus in the supernatant is lower compared to most other clinical isolates. this suggests that the production of defective interfering particles is limited or faulty in HEp-2 cells for this isolate."}
