{"summary": "a male 8-month-old was admitted to the pediatric emergency room with acute respiratory distress due to a high airway obstruction secondary to severe acute laryngitis. he was immediately intubated and referred to the pediatric intensive care unit. after the planned extubation, he presented respiratory distress, but, after the use of the high-flow nasal cannula, he became stable, reducing the heart and respiratory frequencies. in extreme cases, there is paleness, cyanosis, numbness, seizures, apnea, and death. the high-flow nasal cannula is an alternative modality of medicinal gas administration, with heated and humidified oxygen in flows that range, in pediatrics, from 1 to 2 L/kg. the high-flow nasal cannula is an alternative modality of medicinal gas administration. the child was born in a C-section, at term, and was intubated for 17 days. he presented with tracheal extubation failure caused by high respiratory distress. dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg/day) was introduced on the first day of hospitalization. he remained in mechanical ventilation, requiring ventilator support. a new flexible bronchoscopy was carried out for the supervised extubation. a thoracic X-ray was performed for the programming of the tracheal extubation. the infant was comfortable in the high-flow nasal cannula. the patient presented with severe acute laryngitis and benefitted from the use of high-flow nasal cannula in the tracheal post-extubation period. there was a transition from the high-flow nasal cannula to nebulization with oxygen at 2 L/minute for one more day. tracheal intubation occurs in acute laryngitis. edema associated with agitation may make the procedure more difficult. the high-flow nasal cannula is effective and pointed to a good response. studies do not specifically address acute laryngitis. the use of high-flow nasal cannula is not inferior to noninvasive ventilation."}{"summary": "a male 8-month-old was admitted to the pediatric emergency room with acute respiratory distress due to a high airway obstruction secondary to severe acute laryngitis. he was immediately intubated and referred to the pediatric intensive care unit. after the planned extubation, he presented respiratory distress, but, after the use of the high-flow nasal cannula, he became stable, reducing the heart and respiratory frequencies. in extreme cases, there is paleness, cyanosis, numbness, seizures, apnea, and death. the high-flow nasal cannula is an alternative modality of medicinal gas administration, with heated and humidified oxygen in flows that range, in pediatrics, from 1 to 2 L/kg. the high-flow nasal cannula is an alternative modality of medicinal gas administration. the child was born in a C-section, at term, and was intubated for 17 days. he presented with tracheal extubation failure caused by high respiratory distress. dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg/day) was introduced on the first day of hospitalization. he remained in mechanical ventilation, requiring ventilator support. a new flexible bronchoscopy was carried out for the supervised extubation. a thoracic X-ray was performed for the programming of the tracheal extubation. the infant was comfortable in the high-flow nasal cannula. the patient presented with severe acute laryngitis and benefitted from the use of high-flow nasal cannula in the tracheal post-extubation period. there was a transition from the high-flow nasal cannula to nebulization with oxygen at 2 L/minute for one more day. tracheal intubation occurs in acute laryngitis. edema associated with agitation may make the procedure more difficult. the high-flow nasal cannula is effective and pointed to a good response. studies do not specifically address acute laryngitis. the use of high-flow nasal cannula is not inferior to noninvasive ventilation."}
