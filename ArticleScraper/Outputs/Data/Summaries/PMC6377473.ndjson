{"summary": "the binding properties of the mutated proteins were studied by hemagglutination assay (HAA) with rat erythrocytes and by solid-phase lectin-binding enzyme-linked immune assay (sp-LBA) with bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) as ligand. sp-LBA performed with sp-LBA confirmed the binding to 9-O-Ac-Sias. we systematically replaced residues within or proximal to the proposed binding site in OC43 S1A by their BCoV orthologs. however, the replacement of residues 147\u2013151 (Ser-Thr-Gln-Asp-Gly) by leu resulted in a large deletion. the actual RBS is located elsewhere. ets colored green, the -helix colored red, 310-helices colored blue, and side chains of site A residues, supposedly critical for 9-O-Ac Sia binding (17), indicated in sticks and colored orange. side chains of residues that differ between BCoV Mebus and OC43 ATCC S1A are indicated in cyan. crystals formed under a variety of conditions, but all with space group P3121 with two S1A molecules per asymmetric unit. crystals disintegrated within seconds during soaking attempts with receptor analog methyl-5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetyl--neuraminoside. the results do not provide direct clues to the location of the 1CoV S RBS. they permit a side-by-side comparison of the S1A domains of two divergent 1CoVs. the difficulties met by us and others to identify the RBS led us to switch strategy. adjacent hydrophobic pocket/depression (P2) is separated by an aromatic side chain. the side chain intercalates between the O- and N-acyl groups. site A previously proposed as the BCoV S1A RBS (17) does not conform to this signature. evidence from comparative structural analysis and structure-guided mutagenesis to suggest that the S1A RBS locates at site B. close-up of BCoV S1A site B in surface representation with hydrophobic pockets P1 and P2 indicated. sulfate ion bound to site B in the BCoV S1A apo structure is also shown. OC43 S1A\u2013Fc result in substantial to complete loss of binding as measured by conventional HAA at 4 \u00b0C. mutations, resulting in residual binding, render the S1A RBS thermolabile. assays performed with S1A\u2013Fc protein multivalently presented on pA-LS as in ref. 40. site B is conserved in all three 1CoVs and should be readily accessible also in the context of the fully folded intact spike (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). the rapid disintegration of PHEV S1A crystals during soaking may well be explained by disruption of crystal contacts in result of ligand-binding. binding was no longer observed for either PHEV or for OC43 S1A. substitution of either Lys81 or Thr83 in PHEV S1A led to loss of detectable binding. HA by OC43 S1A-Ser83Ala and OC43 S1A-Lys81Ala residual binding was detected. OC43 and BCoV S1A differ at site B only at position 83, which is either a Thr (in BCoV) or Ser (in OC43) despite this near identity, BCoV S1A is the stronger binder of the two. differences in intra- and intersegment hydrogen bonds that fix the central site B 5-3101 segment through interactions with loop L1 and with the 3102-12\u2032 loop. the difference between BCoV and PHEV S1A in intraloop L1 hydrogen bonding between residues 24 and 26. the difference in S1A-binding affinity between PHEV and BCoV can be ascribed to the architecture of site B. changes in S1A L1\u20135-3101 association may alter pocket P1 and thereby affect ligand binding. one remaining question is how Tyr162, Glu182, Trp184, and His185 in site A affect the RBS. luciferase-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus is essential for infectivity. we expressed wild-type BCoV S either exclusively or together with a secretory HE\u2013Fc fusion protein. resulting particles were noninfectious as measured by luciferase assay. infectivity increased by a further 5.7-fold upon addition of HE\u2013Fc to the inoculum. mutations in site B caused complete loss of infectivity (Trp90Ala) or significantly reduced infectivity to extents correlating with the effect of each mutation on S binding affinity. in the absence of endogenous HE\u2013Fc, site B mutants are cleaved to extents inversely related to RBS affinity. HCoV-HKU1 is a lineage A betacoronavirus but separated from the 1CoVs by a considerable evolutionary distance. agglutination of rat erythrocytes was observed when HKU1 S1A\u2013Fc was tested by high-sensitivity NP-HAA with multivalent presentation of the HKU1 S1A-Fc proteins. the detection of such interactions critically depends on multivalency of receptors and receptor-binding proteins (10, 40) NP-HAA with erythrocytes (mock)depleted for 9-O-Ac-Sias by prior sialate-O-acetylesterase treatment. protein structures aligned with site B residues Lys81, Thr83, and Trp90 as query. in elements e1 (N29Q) and e2 (N251Q), individually and in combination (N29Q + N251Q). replacement of HKU1 S1A e1 and e2 by corresponding BCoV elements increases binding affinity to 9-O-sialoglycans as to allow detection by conventional HAA. e1 and e2 in HKU1 S1A by corresponding segments from BCoV increased receptor-binding as measured by NP-HAA by 16- or 256-fold for e1 and e2 respectively. the enhanced binding was still 9-O-Ac-Sia-dependent. e2 increased receptor affinity to such extent that also binding to BSM became detectable, although only with nanoparticle-bound and not with free S1A. the deletion of glycosylation sites did not enhance but actually lowered the binding affinity of HKU1 S1A. occlusion of the HKU1 S RBS by e1 and e2 might allow selective high-affinity binding to particular sialoglycans with the 9-O-Ac-Sia terminally linked to extended glycan chains. occlusion of the HKU1 S RBS by e1 and e2 might allow selective high-affinity binding to particular sialoglycans. the S1A RBS is Located Elsewhere than Currently Believed. the binding properties of the mutated proteins were studied by hemagglutination assay (HAA) with rat erythrocytes and by solid-phase lectin-binding enzyme-linked immune assay (sp-LBA) as ligand. we systematically replaced residues within or proximal to the proposed binding site in OC43 S1A by their BCoV orthologs. a mutant in which we combined all substitutions and thus reconstructed the proposed BCoV S1A RBS in the OC43 background did not differ in its binding affinity from the parental wild-type OC43 protein. site A residues in PHEV and OC43 S1A\u2013Fc result in partial, but not complete loss of RBS binding affinity. substitutions of site A residues in PHEV and OC43 S1A\u2013Fc result in partial, but not complete loss of RBS binding affinity. crystals formed under a variety of conditions, but all with space group P3121 with two S1A molecules per asymmetric unit. crystals disintegrated within seconds during soaking attempts with receptor analog methyl-5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetyl--neuraminoside. the results do not provide direct clues to the location of the 1CoV S RBS. but they permit a side-by-side comparison of the S1A domains of two divergent 1CoVs. structural comparison of viral attachment proteins may aid to define common parameters of recognition. the 5-N-acyl in an adjacent hydrophobic pocket/depression (P2) is separated by an aromatic side chain. the side chain is placed so that in the bound state the side chain intercalates between the O- and N-acyl groups. site A previously proposed as the BCoV S1A RBS (17) does not conform to this signature. the 5-N-acyl moiety would be accommodated by a hydrophobic patch within the adjacent pocket, which is wide enough to accept a 5-N-glycolyl group. evidence from comparative structural analysis and structure-guided mutagenesis to suggest that the S1A RBS locates at site B. residues in PHEV and OC43 S1A\u2013Fc result in substantial to complete loss of binding as measured by conventional HAA at 4 \u00b0C. substitution of proposed ligand contacting residues Trp90, Lys81, and Thr83/Ser83 results in total loss of detectable binding even when assayed by high-sensitivity nanoparticle HAA. site B is conserved in all three 1CoVs and should be readily accessible also in the context of the fully folded intact spike (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) in the PHEV and BCoV S1A crystals (17), however, site B\u2014but not site A\u2014is occluded by packing contacts. binding was no longer observed for either PHEV or for OC43 S1A. substitution of either Lys81 or Thr83 in PHEV S1A led to complete loss of detectable binding even by NP-HAA. similar results were obtained upon substitution of leu86 and leu80. OC43 and BCoV S1A differ at site B only at position 83, which is either a Thr (in BCoV) or Ser (in OC43) despite this near identity, BCoV S1A is the stronger binder of the two. differences in intra- and intersegment hydrogen bonds that fix the central site B 5-3101 segment through interactions with loop L1 and with the 3102-12\u2032 loop (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). note the pivotal role of the 3102-12\u2032 loop Arg180 side chain bridging the L1 and 56 loops through multiple interactions with main chain carbonyls. changes in S1A-binding affinity between PHEV and BCoV can be ascribed to the architecture of site B as determined by the L1\u20135-3101 hydrogen bonding network. changes in S1A L1\u20135-3101 association may alter pocket P1 and thereby affect ligand binding. one possible explanation is the location of strand 12\u2032. luciferase-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus is essential for infectivity. we expressed wild-type BCoV S either exclusively or together with a secretory HE\u2013Fc fusion protein. resulting particles were noninfectious as measured by luciferase assay. site B mutations caused complete loss of infectivity (Trp90Ala) or significantly reduced infectivity to extents correlating with the effect of each mutation on S binding affinity (Trp90Ala) in the absence of endogenous HE\u2013Fc, site B mutants are cleaved to extents inversely related to RBS affinity. in the absence of endogenous HE\u2013Fc, site B mutants are cleaved to extents inversely related to RBS affinity. agglutination of rat erythrocytes was observed when HKU1 S1A\u2013Fc was tested by high-sensitivity NP-HAA with multivalent presentation of the HKU1 S1A-Fc proteins. the detection of such interactions critically depends on multivalency of receptors and receptor-binding proteins (10, 40) NP-HAA with erythrocytes (mock)depleted for 9-O-Ac-Sias by prior sialate-O-acetylesterase treatment. protein structures were aligned with site B residues Lys81, Thr83, and Trp90 as query. replacement of HKU1 S1A e1 and e2 by corresponding BCoV elements increases binding affinity to 9-O-sialoglycans. sp-LBA with soluble S1A-Fc complexed to pA-LS icosahedral shells in twofold serial dilutions. the corresponding site in HKU1 S1A is located at the bottom of a canyon because it is flanked by parallel ridges comprised of HKU1 S1A residues 28 through 34. the corresponding site in HKU1 S1A is located at the bottom of a canyon because it is flanked by protruding parallel ridges comprised of HKU1 S1A residues 28 through 34 [element (e)1 corresponding to BCoV L22 residues replacement of e2 increased receptor affinity to such extent that also binding to BSM became detectable, although only with nanoparticle-bound and not with free S1A. we expressed the protein in HEK293S GnTI cells (44) replacement of complex N-glycans by high-mannose sugars resulted in an eightfold increase in binding affinity. occlusion of the HKU1 S RBS by e1 and e2 might allow selective high-affinity binding to particular sialoglycans with the 9-O-Ac-Sia terminally linked to extended glycan chains. occlusion of the HKU1 S RBS by e1 and e2 might allow selective high-affinity binding to particular sialoglycans. the 5\u2032-terminal sequences of the S genes of BCoV strain Mebus (GenBank: P15777.1), OC43 strain ATCC VR-759 (GenBank: AAT84354.1), PHEV strain UU (GenBank: ASB17086.1), HKU1 strain Caen1 (GenBank: ADN03339.1), and mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (GenBank: P11224.2) were cloned in expression vector p complexed proteins were twofold serially diluted and mixed 1:1 with rat erythrocytes. HA was assessed after 2-h incubation on ice unless stated otherwise. erythrocytes (50% in PBS pH 8.0) were treated with soluble HE+. the resulting intermediate was subjected to Staudinger reduction by 1 M trimethylphosphine in toluene (3 eq.) in presence of potassium hydroxide. the residue was purified with silica gel and then p-2 biogel to give pure Neu5,9NAc22Me at a yield of 31% over four steps. crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using reservoir solution. crystals were soaked with methyl-5,9-di-N-acetyl-neuraminoside and methyl-5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetyl-neuraminoside. water molecules were built in difference density peaks of at least 5.0. CC1/2 in the outer resolution shell is 0.845 for reflections within 20\u00b0from c*, whereas it is 0.00 within 20\u00b0 from the a*b* plane. Molecular docking of 9-O-Sia in the crystal structure of apo-BCoV S1A (PDB ID code 4H14) was performed with AutoDock4 (22) similar to the procedure described by Bakkers et al. a truncated version of the S protein was used to allow transport of S to the cell surface and its incorporation into VSV particles. a truncated version of the S protein was provided with a Flag-tag by cloning its gene in expression vector pCAGGS-Flag. SV-N monoclonal antibody 10G4 (Kerafast) was detected by Western blot analysis. uptake of BCoV S into virus particles was detected by antI-FLAG M2 (Sigma) the amino acid sequences of these S1A\u2013Fc fusion proteins were deposited in GenBank (MG999832-35) they were purified by protein A affinity chromatography from the supernatants of transiently transfected HEK293T cells. standard HAA was performed as in Zeng et al. (18). the 96-well Maxisorp microtitre ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 0.1-g BSM (Sigma-Aldrich) per well. conventional sp-LBAs were performed using twofold serial dilutions of CoV S1A\u2013Fc proteins. acetyl chloride (4 eq.) was added directly. the mixture was neutralized with acidic resin. residue was purified with silica gel and then p-2 biogel to give pure Neu5,9NAc22Me. iffraction data were processed using XDS (49) and scaled using Aimless from the CCP4 suite (50). Molecular replacement was performed using PHASER (51) with BCoV S1A residues 35\u2013410 as template (PDB ID code 14H4) the outer resolution shell is 0.845 for reflections within 20\u00b0from c*. it is 0.00 within 20\u00b0 from the a*b* plane. the ligand molecule was extracted from BCoV HE (PDB ID code 3CL5) pCD5-BCoV HE\u2013Fc (18) were mixed at molar ratios of 8:1. at 48 h after transfection, cells were transduced with VSV-G\u2013pseudotyped VSVG/Fluc (54) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. virions were resuspended in PBS and stored at 80 \u00b0C. infection experiments were performed independently in triplicate. infection experiments were performed with three technical replicates."}
