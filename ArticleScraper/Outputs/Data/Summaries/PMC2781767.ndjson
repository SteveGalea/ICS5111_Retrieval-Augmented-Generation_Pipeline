{"summary": "many plants have long been recognized and widely used in Nepalese traditional medicine. some are relatively unexplored and not arrived to mainstream medicine. the search on new drugs must be continued and natural products from plants, microorganisms, fungi and animals can be the source of innovative and powerful therapeutic agents.

Chaudhary, Central Department of Botany, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal. voucher specimens were deposited in the Tribhuvan University Central Herbarium (TUCH), Kirtipur, Nepal. ex D.

Ranunculaceae Roots and stem Nagghun cell bank of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute was maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS (GIBCO, Paisley, UK) the exponentially growing cells were harvested and seeded at a cell density of 60 000/well in a 96 well microtiter plate (8 mm diameter, Falcon Plastic, NJ) confluent monolayers of cells were treated with 100 l of extracts in four replicates for 30 min. the supernatant was removed and 200 l neutral red solution (0.005%) in optimum was added. microtiter plate was further incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. the supernatant was replaced by 200 l neutral red solution (0.005%) the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. the absorbance was measured at 540 nm and the percentage protection was calculated by the following formula (13) Abies spectabilis 23.4 >100 \u2013 >100 17 Allium oreoprasum 17.8 >100 \u2013 >100 8 Allium prattii 7.5 >100 \u2013 >100 97 Anaphalis busua Leaves 12.2 >100 \u2013 >100 \u2013 Androsace strigilosa 18.2 12.5 \u2013 40 10 Anemone rivularis 14.5 21 \u2013 40 \u2013 Arisaema flavum 18.7 40 \u2013 30 6.25 Astil 78 >100 33 Primula involucrata 31.7 50 \u2013 63 \u2013 Rhododendron anthopogon 22.1 >100 50 >100 44 Rhododendron lepidotum 18.9 100 \u2013 >100 58 Rosa macrophylla Flower 11.2 86 \u2013 >100 45 Rosa sericea 14.2 >100 \u2013 Rubus foliolosus 21.2 >100 50 >100 \u2013 Salix serpyllum 26.2 >100 \u2013 a moderate toxicity was observed for the extracts of asparagus filicinus, Bergenia ciliata, Primula involucrata and Saussurea auriculata with CC50 ranging from 30 to 50 g ml1. a moderate toxicity was exhibited by the extracts of artemisia caruifolia, D. brunonianum and E. longifolia with CC50 ranging from 19 to 25 g ml1 weak activity (IC50 50\u201382 g ml1) was found in the extracts of Bistorta affinis, Juniperus squamata, Oxytropis williamsii, Rhododendron anthopogon and Rubus foliolosus. antiviral activity against influenza virus A was shown by 20 extracts at non-cytotoxic concentrations. ethnomedicine Plant extracts Percentage yield of MeOH extract Antiviral activity HSV-1/Vero cells Antiviral activity Influenza A/MDCK cells Cytotoxicity CC50 (g/ml)* Antiviral activity IC50 (g/ml) Abies spectabilis 23.4 >100 \u2013 >100 17 Allium oreoprasum 17.8 >100 \u2013 >100 8 Allium prattii 7.5 >100 \u2013 >100 97 Anaphalis busua quamata 16.7 >100 82 >100 \u2013 Maharanga emodi 14.7 >100 \u2013 >100 29 Morina longifolia 5.9 >100 \u2013 >100 \u2013 Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora 38.3 >100 \u2013 >100 \u2013 Oxytropis williamsii 27.5 >100 78 >100 33 Prima involucrata 31.7 50 \u2013 63\u2013 Rhododendron anthop the extracts of Androsace strigilosa, Anemone rivularis, Delphinium brunonianum, Euphorbia longifolia and Thalictrum cultratum showed strong cytotoxicity in vero cells with CC50. other eight extracts showed very mild toxicity while rest of the extracts were non-toxic at 100 g ml1. 6.25 g ml1 was observed for the extracts of A. rivularis, B ciliata, Cassiope fastigiata and T. linearis. weak activity (IC50 50\u201382 g ml1) was found in the extracts of Bistorta affinis, Juniperus squamata, Oxytropis williamsii, Rhododendron anthopogon and Rubus foliolosus. phytochemical investigation of A. rivularis revealed presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and bergenin (14,15) polyphenols, especially high polymeric procyanidines possess strong anti-influenza viral activity (17), which is in agreement with previous study. methanol\u2013water extract of Bergenia ligulata inhibited growth of influenza virus A in cell culture with IC50 of 10 g ml1. no antiviral compounds have previously been isolated. the plant is known to contain phenylethanoid and lignan glycosides. the plant is known to contain phenylethanoid and lignan glycosides. our results indicate that several plants used in traditional medicine could be the lead to potential antiviral drugs. the results are useful for rationalizing the use of medicinal plants in primary health care in Nepal."}
