{"summary": "the sources of uncertainty are myriad, but can be broadly classified into one of two categories [5]\u2013[7] the implementation of epidemiological interventions under epistemic uncertainty usually takes place via one of two distinct approaches. the implementation of epidemiological interventions under epistemic uncertainty usually takes place via one of two distinct approaches. AM determines an optimal state-dependent policy, given a set of management options, a reward function, and one or more state dynamics models. reducing epistemic uncertainty is justified only when it leads to improved management; learning is not valued for its own sake. using an AM approach has several key advantages over existing approaches. AM involves a sequence of steps (Table 1), including the statement of an objective (usually encapsulated in a reward [or cost] function) all possible model and action combinations are then evaluated in terms of their ability to achieve the stated objective. if all models agree about the best management action, then no further analysis is needed. assessment of empirical observations provides evidence to reduce uncertainty and update weights on alternative models Inference to reassess model credibility and updating weights to improve management in light of new information Initial movement through the set-up phase is followed by rapid iterative learning in the implementation phase. an outer feedback loop (from H to A, B, or C) can arise, with occasional reconsideration of steps in the set-up phase, as necessary. the EVPI calculates the objective value gained by learning before making a decision. it involves a comparison of costs (and/or benefits) assuming perfect information with costs (and/or benefits) assuming the current level of information. the difference between the average of optimum values conditional on each model and the optimum of an average of values. a Bold numbers highlight the best (lowest cost) outcomes possible. b Italic numbers are the worst outcomes possible. we describe in detail both the set-up (i.e., pre-outbreak) and implementation phases of an AM approach. the outbreak was characterized by significant, extended, and controversial scientific and political debate about the most appropriate management strategy for the disease. there was no a priori plan to actively include improved understanding of the system dynamics in later decision making. we use an AM framework (Table 1) to first outline the set-up phase. step B: identify possible management actions We consider four nested management actions. a thin, steep kernel (K1); the current estimate from past experience in the UK (K2); a fat, shallow kernel (K3); we assume the same total force of infection for each kernel. the UK kernel (K2) was estimated using contact tracing from the 2001 epidemic. the shape of this distance-dependent transmission kernel will be a key source of epistemic uncertainty. step D: develop a monitoring plan To rapidly discriminate among competing models, we require information on key inputs for the cost function. the CP strategy would result in the lowest expected cost in light of model uncertainty. RC is also never the best solution, and is the worst strategy for K1 and K3. if we could resolve uncertainty prior to committing to an action, we would choose the best action under the true model. left of the dashed line indicates model projections under the phase 1 management action prior to the first opportunity to update management. right of the dashed line indicates new projections from each model, conditional on the observed epidemic up to the decision point, from which to assess the alternative management actions. the best stage 1 tactic in an adaptive strategy is CP, and the expected costs are \u00a3695.3 million. the bulk of the \u00a345.9 million EVPI can only be regained if uncertainty is resolved earlier in the epidemic. adaptive strategy can be recovered by an adaptive strategy (Figure 3D, shaded region) drops quickly, from >80% when the weight on the UK kernel is less than 0.13 to 2% if the weight on the UK kerned is >0.41. analysis can be used to determine whether an adaptive approach is likely to be justified relative to a priori uncertainty in the outbreak scenarios. the x-axis indicates the cost (in millions of pounds) or duration (days) threshold that managers would like to stay below. the y-axis indicates the probability of outcomes below the threshold for each management tactic. we assume a deterministic SEIR-type, age-structured epidemic model. we calculate the number of measles cases averted by a reactive vaccination campaign that aims for 90% coverage in the target age classes. the duration of a campaign is determined as the size of the target population divided by the daily vaccination rate. vaccinate 0\u201310 years; yellow, vaccinate 0\u201315 years) for each vaccination rate. the optimal vaccination target age, as a function of the weight on each of the three models of the susceptible population (axes on ternary plots) and the time, in days, at which the vaccination target can be changed to the optimal target conditional on the true susceptible age distribution. an adaptive strategy updated between days 15\u201360 can realize 90%\u2013100% of the EVPI and a reduction of burden by 12,000 to 19,000 cases relative to a static strategy that applies a single age target throughout. if the daily vaccination rate is fixed, the time required to assess and implement more informed actions affects the choice of initial action. a priori plan to actively include improved understanding of the system dynamics in later decision making. we re-evaluate the problem in a decision-analytical context for alternative versions of one of these models, the Keeling and colleagues [13] model (details of the model are given in Text S1A) culling of livestock on infected premises (farms with confirmed cases of disease) only (IP); culling of dangerous contacts. ring culling in a 3 km radius of infected premises in addition to dangerous contact culling (RC) the shape of this distance-dependent transmission kernel will be a key source of epistemic uncertainty. step D: develop a monitoring plan To rapidly discriminate among competing models, we require information on the key inputs for the cost function. we require information on the location and detection date of infected farms, and contact tracing. a priori model weights, the expected costs of the best strategy are \u00a3650.1 million and \u00a3479.5 million for case 1 and 2 respectively. a novel outbreak for which prior belief in the transmission dynamics does not support one kernel model more than another (case 1), the EVPI is \u00a365.9 million ( = 540.7 million\u2013479.5 million), which is an expected 11.3% cost reduction. line indicates the observed time series of the epidemic up to the decision point. right of the dashed line indicates new projections from each model. analysis of the foot-and-mouth case study. the best stage 1 tactic in an adaptive strategy is CP. the expected costs are \u00a3695.3 million. the bulk of the \u00a345.9 million EVPI can only be regained if uncertainty is resolved earlier in the epidemic. the expected value formulation implies that the goal of management is to maximize the average benefit (or minimize average costs) however, this objective does not explicitly account for variation in outbreak outcomes. alternative expressions of the objective might aim to minimize the risk of catastrophic events such as particularly extreme outcomes. the x-axis indicates the cost (in millions of pounds) or duration (days) threshold that managers would like to stay below the threshold for each management tactic. the problem In 2001 a large outbreak of FMD (Aphtae epizooticae), a highly contagious viral disease of livestock caused major disruption to British agriculture and tourism. the objective is to minimize the cost of livestock lost through disease mortality and culling. where C is the overall cost in pounds sterling, Ncattle and Nsheep represent the number of cattle and sheep lost to the disease or culled as part of the control strategy. al kernel models for FMD in the UK represent a continuum of possible dispersal kernels. we encapsulate the uncertainty in the risk of transmission between farms using three dispersal kernel models. the UK kernel (K2) was estimated using contact tracing from the 2001 epidemic after the introduction of movement restrictions. the best fixed strategy is CP culling (Table 2). Across the three models, for case 1 and case 2, the CP strategy gives the lowest model-weighted projected cost (\u00a3696.0 million and \u00a3540.7 million for the two cases, respectively) the CP strategy gives the lowest model-weighted projected cost (\u00a3696.0 million and \u00a3540.7 million for the two cases, respectively) EVPI is \u00a361.2 million ( = 540.7 million\u2013479.5 million), which is an expected 11.3% cost reduction. the best fixed strategy will be conditional on the remaining weights. the resultant EVPI quantifies the economic incentive for implementing an AM plan. the EVPI (red line) as a function of the weight on the other two models. grey shading indicates the amount of the EVPI that is expected to be recovered under an adaptive strategy. a two-stage management strategy Detection of a new outbreak would trigger the iterative implementation phase (step F\u2013H) EVPI peaks at low a priori weight on the UK (K2) kernel (assuming the remaining weight is evenly split between K1 and K3). the amount of EVPI that can be recovered by an adaptive strategy drops quickly, from >80% when the weight on the UK kernel is less than 0.13 to 2% if the weight on the UK kerned is >0.41. CP culling maximizes, or results in the same, probability of remaining below the threshold cost or duration for the majority of possible thresholds. if threshold duration is low, the more aggressive RC alternative is most likely to stay below the threshold for the majority of possible thresholds. a larger age-range should increase the chances of reaching non-immune individuals. delay in completion of vaccination could limit potential impact of a campaign. delay in completion of vaccination could limit the ability to rapidly respond elsewhere if an outbreak spreads. we assume that all three age distributions have equal a priori weight. detection of a real outbreak would then trigger the iterative implementation phase (Table 1F\u2013H) when vaccination rates are low the best fixed strategy is to vaccinate only 5 years. the potential to improve outcomes by learning (EVPI) is low because broader campaigns (up to 10 years or 15 years) would be prohibitively slow even if there were many older susceptible individuals. the problem Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality worldwide. in 2010, an outbreak of measles spread across Malawi resulting in >135,000 new cases [46]. the ministry of health collaborated with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to expand vaccination campaigns in eight districts to target children aged from 6 months to 15 years. the duration of a vaccination campaign is determined as the size of the target population divided by the daily vaccination rate. it is unlikely that the vaccine distribution rate will be known a priori. we represent uncertainty in the susceptible age distribution, analogous to the setting in 2010. we first assume a vaccination campaign conducted on day 75 of the outbreak. we calculate the optimal fixed age-target and the expected value of resolving uncertainty about the susceptible age distribution. when vaccination rates are low the best fixed strategy is to vaccinate only 5 years. the potential to improve outcomes by learning (EVPI) is low. an adaptive strategy updated between days 15\u201360 can realize 90%\u2013100% of the EVPI and a reduction of burden by 12,000 to 19,000 cases relative to a static strategy that applies a single age target throughout. an AM approach could be employed to realize a good portion (32.85% for case 2) of the EVPI. AM approach to the measles outbreak response case study illustrates how management decisions can be framed in the context of discrete and continuous uncertainty. the cost of uncertainty about the at-risk population is critically dependent on the logistical capacity to implement the optimal vaccination target. if vaccination targets can be rapidly adjusted to the outbreak setting at hand, then the optimal strategy is to implement the smallest, fastest initial age target. AM plays a role in the common situation where a mechanistic understanding cannot be resolved a priori. so managers must choose among the potentially disparate recommendations of alternative models or parameterizations. EVPI is a measure of the degree of consistency between model predictions with respect to management actions. the expected cost of an adaptive strategy is always less than that of a single fixed strategy. optimal vaccine targets and the additional benefit of an adaptive approach depend both on uncertainty about the age-distribution of the at-risk population and on logistical constraints of implementing improved interventions. AM is flexible and can easily accommodate alternative objectives, additional management options, other models, and multiple sources of uncertainty. AM can improve management outcomes in situations where management actions are taken repeatedly in time or space. the potential for improvement may be limited by monitoring capacity or by the logistical or political capacity to enact changes. AM may yield significant rewards in terms of money or lives saved. panels from right to right indicate utility functions (insets) that are increasingly risk-seeking. each ternary figure indicates the optimal static strategy for the objective of minimizing outbreak duration. each ternary figure indicates the optimal static strategy for the objective of minimizing outbreak duration. click here for additional data file."}
