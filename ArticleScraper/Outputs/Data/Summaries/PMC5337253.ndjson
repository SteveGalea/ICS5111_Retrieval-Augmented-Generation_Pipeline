{"summary": "the impact of an ageing population on healthcare expenditures has been widely discussed over the past three decades. some studies have suggested that rapid growth in the older adult population is a significant cost-driver for healthcare services through mechanisms such as increased utilisation due to longer lifespan. public funding from the government budget supports almost all expenditures of the public healthcare sector, while only 5% are charged to users. a lump sum is given to HA each year, and HA allocates budgets to individual hospitals based on their baseline activities, case-mix, and population served. outside this, there are 11 registered private hospitals in Hong Kong to date. if current demographic patterns continue, it is predicted that 26% of the population will be older adults, and by 2041, 30%.29 It is crucial to have some empirical assessment of the contribution of ageing to hospitalisation days, for effective healthcare planning. census statistics for Hong Kong\u2019s resident population are stratified by gender and five-year age group, with an open age group for those aged 85 and above. aggregated inpatient data included records from all 41 public hospitals in Hong Kong, which provided 27.2 thousand hospital beds as of 2012-2013. data from private hospitals are not available and they were not included in the analysis. total hospitalisation days between the time points can provide a direct understanding of the changes of the financial burden on the healthcare system. decomposition analysis in demography generally deals with the difference between two rates/means. the mathematical expression would be no different from normal if considering the difference of two total numbers. the first term gives the magnitude of change in total hospitalisation days contributed to by the change in LOS, weighted by i2ri2i2P2. the second term accounts for the contribution due to the change in the number of discharge episodes per patient, weighted by li1ri2i2P2 and so on. total hospitalisation days were projected up to 2041. we assumed that the hospital discharge rate, number of discharge episodes per patient and LOS were maintained at 2012 age-gender group levels for the next three decades, up to 2041. decomposition analysis was then applied to decompose the increase of total hospitalisation days between 2012 and each targeting year into two demographic factors. data from private hospitals are not available and they were not included in the analysis. private hospitals provide a range of clinical services similar to public ones. private hospitals provide a range of services similar to public ones. but due to the difference in funding, services provided by private hospitals are much more expensive. i t E i t E i t E i t E i t I i t I i t I i t I i t I i t P i t P i t P i t P t = i l i t i t i t P t = i l i 1 i 1 r i 1 r i 1 r i 1 the second term accounts for the contribution due to the change in the number of discharge episodes per patient, weighted by li1ri2i2P2 and so on. the idea behind the decomposition is to shift the weight from the second time point to the first time point, one by one, when moving to the next factor. scenario analyses were performed by applying different values in the improvement of the three service components. in each scenario, we assumed a 5%, 10% or 15% decrease of different service components from 2012-2041 at age-gender group level. decomposition analysis was then applied to decompose the difference between 2012 and 2041 to examine the contribution of each component. every year, 31.38%-35.18% of inpatients, comprising 38.20%-42.00% of discharge episodes and 45.31%-50.52% of total hospitalisation days, were older adults. the majority of the increase came from those aged 75 or older, which is over-representative of the population. Detailed breakdown of the figures can be found in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of Population and Discharges from publicly funded hospitals in Hong Kong, by Selected year 2001, 2004, and 2012. a shift in population structure (ie, ageing) was mainly due to a shift in population structure (ie, ageing) total hospitalisation days decreased by 599 718 days per annum on average. the decrease in LOS, the change in the number of discharges per patient, and the decreased discharge rate in almost all age-gender groups contributed to 63.86%, 8.14%, and 57.88% of the reduction. change in population structure alone contributed to a 128 685 increase, of which 81.53% was contributed by individuals aged 75 or above. the contribution of children and adolescents to the change in total hospitalisation days was small. 81 (20.98) 65-74 F -76 888 (4.27) 17 302 (-0.96) -125 462 (6.97) 11 287 (-0.63) -173 762 (9.66) M -241 040 (13.40) -23 712 (1.32) -79 319 (4.41) 26 320 (-1.46) -317 751 (17.66) 75+ F -105 515 (5.86) -44 653 (2.48) -54 126 (-9.80) 26 538 (4.80) M -216 613 (-39.21) 46 609 (8.44) 64 086 (11.60) -115 206 (-20.85) -221 124 (-40.02) 45-64 F -174 067 (-31.51) 107 989 (19.55) 107 136 (19.39) 224 065 (40.55) 265 122 (47.99) sensitivity analysis was conducted using data from 2004-2011. total hospitalisation days rose by 74 630 days only. it consolidated the result that decrease in LOS solely offset the increases contributed by all other factors. this result further suggested that the change of LOS from 2011-2012 was so minor that it could no longer counteract the increased hospitalisation days due to increased hospital discharge rates. 1 assumed that LOS would further decrease by 5% at every age-gender group in 2041 through service improvement. it would decrease the total projected days by 738 371 and the reduced LOS would contribute to a 568 667 days decrease. this was an expected result, as total hospitalisation days was a multiplication of the five components. -1 137 335 - 4 733 986 1 484 225 5 080 876 -1 476 741 5 (-10% in [2] for age 45) total hospitalisation days decreased by 599 718 days per annum on average, representing an annual reduction rate of 6.79%. growth in population size and the change in population structure would contribute an increase to total hospitalisation days of 29 254 and 149 933 days per annum. total hospitalisation days increased by an average of 69 062 days (+0.87%) per annum. change in population structure alone contributed to a 128 685 increase. -66 503 (3.70) -140 993 (7.84) -26 866 (1.49) -155 129 (8.62) M -311 598 (17.32) 13 709 (-0.76) -213 937 (11.89) -72 305 (4.02) -584 131 (32.47) 45-64 F -53 809 (2.99) 15 394 (-0.86) -167 745 (9.32) 105 039 (-5.84) 15 126 (2.74) 29 146 (5.28) M -34 981 (-6.33) 14 571 (2.64) 28 048 (5.08) 18 900 (3.42) 26 538 (4.80) 5-14 F -31 253 (-5.66) -237 (-0.04) 25 320 (4.58) -26 679 (-4.83) -32 850 (-5.95) M -23 663 (-4.28) 1995 (0.36) 24 293 (4.40) total hospitalisation days in 2022 are projected to increase by 1 021 592 days contributed to by population ageing, and 631 544 days due to population growth. between 2012 and 2041, population ageing is predicted to contribute. increase in total hospitalisation days of 4.99 million (60.77%) increase in population size contributes to 1.57 million (19.10%) overall hospital discharge rate would still increase by 34.42% due to a large older adult population in 2041. -568 667 - 4 861 598 1 526 316 5 819 247 -738 371 2 (-5% in [1] for age 45) - -568 667 - 4 861 598 1 526 316 5 819 247 -738 371 3 (-10% in [1] for age 45) - -1 137 335 - 4 733 986 1 484 225 5 080 876 -1 476 741 6 ( population growth and ageing have increased the demand of inpatient services by 2.74 million hospitalisation days. decreases in LOS, from 6.92 to 5.29 days on average, offset this increase. HA has markedly improved the hospital management of Hong Kong. the pace and magnitude of ageing have posed serious challenges to the carrying capacity of Hong Kong\u2019s public hospital system. the impact of ageing on Hong Kong\u2019s society is more severe than on most developed countries, through a faster decline in the number of working-age members of the population per retiree. the same percentage of decrease in any one of the components would result in the same projected hospitalisation days. the variability of LOS (coefficient of variation = 0.14) was much higher than the hospital discharge rate (0.07) and number of discharges per patient (0.04) LOS should only be taken if the same level of or even better quality of care and patient satisfaction can be assured. the extent to which further decreases in LOS associate with inpatient demand deserves more attention in Hong Kong. total hospitalisation days contributed to by five factors, especially due to changes in population composition and size. this methodology can be applied in different settings to examine the contribution that ageing makes to hospitalisation days, and can therefore provide evidence for appropriate intervention. key messages Implications for policy makers We quantified the changes in hospitalisation days empirically into various components. ageing was found to make the strongest contribution to increasing inpatient demand, and will continue to do so."}
