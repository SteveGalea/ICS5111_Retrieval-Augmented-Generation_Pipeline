{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) thought to be mediated by myelin-specific CD4+ T cells (1, 2). depletion of B cells inhibits disability progression in MS subjects younger than 55 years, including those with progressive MS (5, 6). phenotypic analyses of CSF B cells performed so far focused on a limited number of surface markers (7, 8, 21, 22) these studies demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of CSF B cells and plasmablasts in patients with MS and other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND) in comparison to non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) controls (7, 8). cytokine secretion from a large number of intrathecal B cell lines (BCL) derived from pilot and validation cohorts.

CSF cells/well in B cell media (RPMI1640 + 15% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin + L-glutamine) containing 2.5 g/mL CpG oligonucleotides (ODN 2006, InvivoGen, San Diego, USA), 3 ng/mL IFN-, 0.5 g/mL cyclosporine A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and 50% EBV supernatant BCL were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular cytokines. data were acquired by LSR II and analyzed by BD Biosciences. rat anti-human monoclonal antibodies were used for phenotypization. Cryopreserved CSF BCL were thawed and cultured for 1 week in B cell media. cells were then resuspended in X-VIVO media (Lonza), counted by hemocytometer (LW Scientific), and resuspended at 1 106 cells/mL. this aliquot was also used for proportional live-B cell counting using flow cytometry. serial dilutions of the PI-stained BCL with APC beads mixture were analyzed by flow cytometer to derive linear regression models of live (PI negative) B cells per APC beads. dilutions were used to derive linear regression models of live (PI negative) B cells per APC beads. ELISA assays Supernatants from stimulated CSF BCL were analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, lymphotoxin (LT)- and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) a Detection limit determined from linear portion of standard curve. limit is recalculated to reflect utilized dilution factor of CSF. the diagnostic code was broken only after the functional data were acquired. n = 80 pilot cohort consisted of 47 MS patients (35 RRMS, 9 PPMS and 3 SPMS) and 33 controls (14 OIND and 19 NIND) n = 80 pilot cohort consisted of 47 MS patients (35 RRMS, 9 PPMS and 3 SPMS) transformation efficiency was almost 5 times higher in the control group, reaching 1 BCL per 100,046 seeded CSF cells (1/91,130 in OIND and 1/129,767 in NIND; ns) the efficiency of immortalization correlated weakly with CSF cell count and with CSF IgG index. double negative (CD27\u2013/IgD\u2013) B cells in CSF BCL positively correlates with IgM expression. proportion of nave B cells (CD27\u2013/IgD+) positively correlates with IgM expression. IL-4 secretion resided mostly in nave and transitional B cells. only 13 BCL were derived from control patients (3 from NIND, 10 from OIND), 15 BCL were from patients with PPMS and the remaining 73 were from patients with RRMS. the majority of memory B cells (87.2%) were memory B cells, including CD27-/IgD- memory tissue-based B cells (31) PPMS patients produce more TNF- and LT- than BCL from RRMS. the only significant difference between MS patients and controls resided in the higher production of VEGF in BCL derived from MS patients. some cytokines are secreted early after activation while others are secreted late. they have different sensitivity to protein transport inhibitors such as monensin and brefeldin A. the results are highly dependent on the exact number of seeded cells.

VEGF-C secretion was only positively correlated with VEGF-A secretion. red colors indicate positive, direct correlation, while blue colors indicate negative, inverse correlation. e EDSS is replaced by a more sensitive, statistical learning optimized continuous disability scale. disability ratings are adjusted for patient-specific treatments using mathematical models derived from previously published meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments of MS (37). the efficiency of immortalization correlated weakly with CSF cell count (Spearman = 0.337, p = 0.00299) and with CSF IgG index (Spearman = 0.391, p = 5 104) BCL were almost 100% positive for CD38 (90.52 15.45%) and all expressed co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. LT- and TNF- are strongly co-expressed, based on their strong correlation in individual BCL. none of the BCL produced detectable levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 or transforming growth factor (TGF) 27-/IgD- memory tissue-based B cells (31) express CD80 and CD86 cell activation markers, but generally lacking IgM expression. only 13 BCL were derived from control patients (3 from NIND, 10 from OIND), 15 BCL were from patients with PPMS and the remaining 73 were from patients with RRMS. the only significant difference between MS patients and controls resided in the higher production of VEGF in BCL derived from PPMS. the limitation of the pilot cohort was significantly lower EBV transformation efficiency of the control samples. this led to small numbers of control BCL derived from PMS subjects were low, which raised a possibility that the statistically significant increases in the secretion of TNF- and LT- may have been over-estimated. the results are highly dependent on the exact number of seeded cells. the results are highly dependent on the exact number of seeded cells. the results are highly dependent on the exact number of seeded cells. 107.8 141.1 72.8 SPMS 143.1 240.3 55.0 PPMS 195.6 294.0 82.1 PMS 167.1 266.0 69.9 TNF- HV+NIND 1099.9 1081.7 601.6 0.0044 HV+NIND vs. PMS 0.0242 184.0 OIND 1000.4 604.9 865.5 HV+NIND vs. PMS 0.0217 117.0 RRMS 713.8 538.9 582.1 RRMS 0.9 SPMS 1.9 5.7 0.9 PPMS 2.2 7.7 0.9 PMS 2.1 6.7 0.9 VEGF-C HV+NIND 420.7 349.4 399.2 0.0293 OIND vs. RRMS 0.0422 121.2 OIND 377 345.0 346.1 RRMS 498.2 274.6 401.8 SPMS 394.2 214.1 373.3 PPMS 369.0 203.2 408.1 PMS 382.6 208.4 379. +NIND 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.6044 OIND 0.2 0.9 0.01 RRMS 20.9 91.6 0.02 SPMS 2.2 15.4 0.01 PPMS 0.1 0.1 0.01 PMS 1.2 11.35 0.01 VEGF-C/IL-10 HV+NIND 4.7 9.9 1.7 0.0085 OIND vs. RRMS 0.0210 183.7 OIND 10.1 25.7 2.7 RRMS 193.8 650.9 7.5 SPMS 38.4 19 the validation cohort data revealed that increased VEGF secretion in MS B cells observed in the pilot cohort was limited to VEGF-C. the validation cohort data revealed that increased VEGF secretion in MS B cells observed in the pilot cohort was limited to VEGF-C. similar data were obtained for LT-, where the remaining significant difference was observed between PMS and RRMS. only the LT-/IL-10 ratio achieved formal statistical significance with HV+NIND compared to subjects with intrathecal inflammation (i.e., RRMS + PMS) VEGF-A secretion was only positively correlated with VEGF-A secretion. cytokines analyzed are compared to each other and to the MS-DSS. red colors indicate positive, direct correlation, while blue colors indicate negative, inverse correlation. MS-DSS is freely available via a web-based interphase at: https://bielekovalab.shinyapps.io/msdss/. we observed mild, but highly significant correlations between MS-DSS and three correlated cytokines, IL-1, TNF-, and GM-CSF. the natural weakness of our study resides in the inability to measure cytokine production in neither CNS B cells nor CSF B cells. however, relying on an EBV transformation and in vitro expansion step has been established as viable proxies for inflammation originating from the CNS. higher transformation efficiency cannot be caused by higher EBV seropositivity (15), as we observed that all subjects on whom EBV serology data are available were seropositive. higher transformation efficiency in MS could be mechanistically linked to higher intrathecal EBV expression (12) previously reported in MS, or may result from a defect of cytolytic activity of CSF T cells toward EBV transformed B cells. IL-1 secretion is regulated by caspases, especially by caspase-1. it requires formation of a new intracellular compartment, called Unconventional Protein Secretion (UPS) (46), induced by stress such as the deprivation of nutrients (47). IL-1 secretion is linked to autophagy, raising a possibility that the unique cytokine secretion phenotype of RRMS B cells may be linked to dysfunction in autophagy pathways none of these models performed better than IL-1 alone. this suggests that IL-1 secretion has the dominant effect on MS severity. we found and validated the enhanced production of VEGF in RRMS patients. RRMS patients' BCL, intrathecal B cells derived from PMS patients produced higher amounts of two closely related cytokines, LT- and TNF-. VEGF-C is upregulated only in B cells derived from the early, RRMS stage, and why B cells from PMS instead secrete higher concentrations of TNF- and LT-. the observed changes may have a causative role: e.g., patients with increased production of TNF- and LT- may be predisposed to progressive disease. the defining role intrathecal B cells play in MS is to facilitate compartmentalization of the inflammation into CNS tissue by promoting lymphangiogenesis. article can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00554/full#supplementary-material Click here for additional data file."}
