{"summary": "a cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken among practicing DHPs in Saudi Arabia. 202 DHPs participated in this study. knowledge and attitude were assessed using self-administered questionnaire. MERS was first identified from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in september 2012. it is caused by the novel \u00df coronavirus MERS-(CoV) more than 1400 cases reported with mortality of these cases nearly 40% were identified in Saudi Arabia. medical professionals are very frequently exposed to the bioaerosols generated during certain dental treatments. these bioaerosols composed of relatively small particle size can lead to increased risk of infection among dental professionals. studies from Saudi Arabia have reported good knowledge and positive attitude of MERS-CoV among health-care workers. cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken for 2 months. study participants were active practicing members registered with the Saudi dental society in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. knowledge domain evaluated the DHPs regarding reservoir, causes, source of transmission, symptoms, risk group, prevention, and treatment options of MERS-CoV. knowledge scores ranged from 0 to 17 and cutoff level of 13 were set for poor knowledge and 13 for good knowledge. study participants were active practicing members registered with the Saudi dental society in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. DATA COLLECTION TOOL Questionnaire was modified and used to assess the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals in Saudi Arabia. knowledge domain evaluated the DHPs regarding reservoir, causes, source of transmission, symptoms, risk group, prevention, and treatment options of MERS-CoV. knowledge scores ranged from 0 to 17 and cutoff level of 13 were set for poor knowledge and 13 for good knowledge. an attitude scale ranged from 0 to 10. 202 DHPs answered the questionnaire providing the response rate of 59.23%. most of them were male (67.3%) and belonged to dentist most in number. majority of them were having (54.5%) bachelor's degree in dental profession and (76.7%) working in government institutions. the results are summarized in Table 3. Knowledge of Middle East respiratory syndrome among dental health professionals Figure 2. Mean knowledge and attitude scores. male DHPs showed more knowledge (12.49 2.34 vs. 11.79 2.05, P = 0.002) and positive attitude (8.82 1.66 vs. 8.32 1.79, P = 0.001) toward MERS when compared to female DHPs. compared with physicians and health-care workers due to limited number publications on DHPs. findings show good knowledge and positive attitude of DHPs toward MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. in public domain has led to the dependence mostly on the clinical indicators to diagnose MERS-CoV. on the other hand, DHPs were less knowledgeable about the duration of the infectivity MERS-CoV as nearly half of the respondents gave false responses. the health-care worker's knowledge of newer infectious diseases was poor especially in use of personal protective measures, isolation, and infection control practices. reports suggest that the health-care worker's self-reported infection control practices were deficient and exaggerated. this finding is similar to the other reported studies in which DHPs showed a positive attitude toward the use of barrier precautions while dealing with health-care infections. this could be due to the fact that the dentist with master's qualification receives profound infection control training, and more chances for professional development when compared to the dental auxiliaries. this could be due to traditional and cultural factors of Saudi Arabia, in which males have more exposure to dental health-care sector compared to females. the main strength of this study is that it reports important health issue that could threaten DHPs in Saudi Arabia. findings are helpful in designing effective MERS prevention and control strategies among DHPs."}
