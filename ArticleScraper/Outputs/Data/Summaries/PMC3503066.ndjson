{"summary": "tropism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (27), poliovirus (32), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (15) are strongly influenced by the capacity of the virus to bind specific receptors. infection of discrete regions within the central nervous system (CNS) by strains of adeno-associated virus (AAV) is dependent on carbohydrate-binding specificity. type 3 reovirus strains spread to the CNS using neural and hematogenous routes. these serotype-specific differences in tropism and disease segregate genetically with the viral S1 gene (43, 44), which encodes attachment protein 1 (26, 45) and nonstructural protein 1s (9, 17, 35) both S1 gene products influence reovirus pathogenesis (1, 5\u20137, 23), with the 1 protein thought to target the virus to discrete cell types in the s between 1 and SA involve residues at the N-terminal portion of the body domain, between -spiral repeats 2 and 3. reovirus serotypes engage JAM-A (8, 30), they differ in carbohydrate coreceptor utilization, suggesting that carbohydrate binding by 1 influences reovirus pathology in the CNS. L929 cells (34) were maintained in Joklik's minimum essential medium. they contained 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml of amphotericin B. plasmid-based reverse genetics generated purified reovirus virions. mice were inoculated intramuscularly or intracranially with purified reovirus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. intracranial (IC) inoculations (5 l) were delivered into the right hind limb. mice were monitored for clinical signs of disease for 21 days postinoculation. all animal husbandry and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with public health service policy. at 2 to 3 days of age, newborn mice were inoculated intramuscularly or intracranially with reovirus diluted in PBS. their organs were resected and incubated in 10% formalin at room temperature for 24 to 48 h.

RESULTS SA binding enhances reovirus neurovirulence and spinal cord injury. mice were monitored for the development of reovirus-induced acute flaccid paralysis on day 8 postinoculation. complete paralysis was first observed at this time point; survival frequencies of wild-type and mutant-infected mice at this time point were comparable. spinal cord resected from mice inoculated intramuscularly with 5 106 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1R202W. transverse sections of inferior spinal cord were sectioned and processed for H&E staining, staining for reovirus antigen, or staining for the activated form of caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. spinal cords of the mice infected with the wild-type virus displayed more the inferior spinal cord was resected on day 8 postinoculation. consecutive lumbosacral sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. cells staining positive for caspase-3 were enumerated in individual sections. in the spinal cord and brain, the mutant virus produced significantly higher titers than the wild-type virus at day 4 (P 0.05) titers in the liver of mice infected with the wild-type virus were significantly lower than those in mice infected with the mutant virus throughout the experimental time course of infection. on day 4 postinoculation, the wild-type virus produced a higher titer in the heart. on day 10 postinoculation, the wild-type virus produced a lower titer in the spleen than the mutant virus in the spleen. the number of viral genome copies detected in the serum of mice infected with either virus was comparable. mice were euthanized, their blood was collected, and the viral genome copies in serum were determined by RT-qPCR. results are expressed as the mean viral genome copies per animal for 3 to 5 animals at each time point. differences in titers produced by strains T3D and T3D-1R202W in the spinal cord and brain could result from more efficient spread of the wild-type virus. two asterisks indicate a P value of 0.001 as determined by the log-rank test. results are expressed as the mean viral titers for 4 to 7 animals for each time point. asterisk indicates a P value of 0.05. newborn mice were inoculated intracranially with 100 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1R202W (R202W) on day 8 postinoculation, brains of the infected mice were resected. the brains were bisected, the left hemispheres were processed for histopathology. primary cortical neuron cultures were quantified using an immunofluorescence assay. compared the titers of strains T3D and T3D-1R202W. the wild-type virus infected a significantly higher percentage of cortical neurons. polyclonal reovirus antiserum to detect reovirus antigen (green) and visualized using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. the percentage of infected cells was quantified by dividing the number of neurons exhibiting reovirus staining by the total number of cell nuclei exhibiting DAPI staining. reovirus strain T3D-1R202W contains a point mutation in 1 that ablates the SA-binding capacity. fewer mice infected with strain T3D survived than those infected with strain T3D-1R202W. serotype 3 reovirus causes acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) between 8 and 10 days postinoculation. infected mice exhibit ipsilateral, followed by contralateral, hind-limb paralysis as a consequence of injury within the anterior horn of the spinal cord. reovirus antigen showed more abundant staining in mice infected with wild-type virus than in mutant-infected mice. apoptotic bodies, reactive endothelia, inflammatory infiltrates, and neurons with eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions showed more intense staining in mice. reovirus-infected mice inoculated intramuscularly with 5 106 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1 R202W (R202W) were stained for the cleaved form of caspase-3. cells staining positive for caspase-3 were enumerated in individual sections. newborn mice were inoculated in the right hind limb with 5 106 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1R202W (R202W) at days 2, 4, 8, and 10 postinoculation, the mice were euthanized, hind-limb muscle, spinal cord, brain, and liver were resected. wild-type virus produced a higher titer than the mutant virus in the spleen. the number of viral genome copies detected in the serum of mice infected with either virus was comparable. use of SA is not required for infection of the liver. we inoculated 3-day-old mice intracranially with 2 PFU of either the wild-type or the mutant virus. the wild-type virus produced higher titers in the brain than did the mutant following IC inoculation. this difference reached statistical significance on day 8 postinoculation. we compared histologic sections of brains resected from mice inoculated intracranially with 100 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1R202W. the intensity of reovirus antigen staining, and the cellular distribution of reovirus antigen, was similar in brain sections from the mice infected with either virus. newborn mice were inoculated intracranially with 100 PFU of either T3D or T3D-1R202W (R202W) on day 8 postinoculation, brains of the infected mice were bisected. the left hemispheres were processed for histopathology, and the right hemispheres were prepared for viral titer determination by plaque assay. cultures of mouse cortical neurons were established using cerebral cortices of C57/BL6 embryos at developmental day 15.5. the wild-type virus infected a significantly higher percentage of cortical neurons (5%) than did the mutant virus (1%) at 24 h postinfection, yields of the wild-type and mutant viruses were comparable. field of view contained between 200 and 600 nuclei. asterisk indicates a P value of 0.0001 as determined by Student's t test. results are expressed as the mean viral yield for duplicate samples. non-SA-binding mutant virus T3D-1R202W showed a higher frequency of AFP and enhanced tissue injury than mutant-infected mice. injury in the spinal cord and the brain is associated with apoptosis, with the number of apoptotic neurons in the spinal cord correlating with the extent of neurological symptoms. Arg202 side chain forms a bidentate salt bridge with the carboxylate moiety of SA. the replacement of Arg202 with a tryptophan in T3D-1R202W would remove the electrostatic interaction between the arginine and SA. it is therefore unlikely that the mutant can bind to SA. Arg202 (cyan) of wild-type T3D forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of SA (31) this bond is represented by a dashed red line, illustrating that it is likely lost when Arg202 is replaced with a tryptophan (modeled in yellow) the wild-type strain produced lower titers in the livers of infected mice. reovirus is delivered initially to the CNS by hematogenous routes (1, 6) it is possible that bloodstream dissemination of the mutant virus is subtly enhanced in comparison to the wild-type virus. if so, this difference was not sufficient to permit detection in our assays. type 3 interactions are key determinants of reovirus virulence in the CNS."}
