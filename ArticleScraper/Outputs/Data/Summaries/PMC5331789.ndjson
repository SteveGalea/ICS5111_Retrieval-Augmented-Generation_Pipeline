{"summary": "one form of cell death, necroptosis, has been described following infection with influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), HSV2, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and vaccinia virus (VV) in each of these cases, necroptosis protects the infected animal (2\u20137) pathogen sensor DAI is required for necroptosis in cells infected with an MCMV variant (5). the ribonucleotide reductases ICP6 and ICP10 encoded by HSV1 and HSV2 contain a RHIM-like domain. these ribonucleotide reductases interact with murine RIP1 and RIP3 promote RIP1-RIP3 or RIP3-RIP3 oligomerization, infection culminates in necroptosis. results suggest detection of viral components at two distinct stages is required. reovirus may elicit an alternate form of cell death. methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methyl ketone abolish effector caspase activation in L929 cells infected with reovirus, they fail to block cell death. cell death following reovirus infection exhibits features of necrosis and is diminished by Nec1 a RIP1 kinase inhibitor (30). cell death in L929 cells 48 h following mock infection or infection with 10 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. Luminescence measurement in similarly treated, uninfected cells was considered to represent 100% viability. whole-cell extracts from reovirus-infected cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated MLKL, total MLKL, and the PSTAIR loading control. RIP3-dependent necroptosis requires the activation of the effector protein MLKL (13\u201323), and MLKL phosphorylation is considered to be a hallmark of the activation of the necroptosis signaling cascade. if cells within bone marrow are infected, the identification of primary cells that undergo necroptosis following reovirus infection would allow us to complement our siRNA studies with work using mice genetically deficient in important regulators of necroptosis. cells lacking both caspase-8 and RIP3 were also resistant to death following reovirus infection. BMDMs from wild-type or RIP3/ mice were mock infected with 50 PFU/cell of T3D in the presence of DMSO or Z-VAD-FMK (25 M) cell death 48 h following infection was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. Luminescence measurement in uninfected cells of the same genotype was considered to represent 100% viability. deficient BMDMs in wild-type cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were 1 log10 unit. the genetic absence of RIP3 enhanced the virus yield to 1.7 log10 units. a blockade of apoptosis does not influence reovirus replication in cell culture. we purified total RNA from mock-infected cells 24 h following infection. RNA extracted from mock-infected cells induced a significantly larger amount of cell death following transfection into cells. cells were transfected with 100 ng of RNA extracted from mock-infected cells. L929 cells were transfected with 100 ng of RNA extracted from mock-infected cells. levels of IFN-mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR 18 h following transfection. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR 18 h following transfection. the IFN-/GAPDH ratio for 0 mM was considered to have a value of 1. cells pretreated with 0 or 20 mM AC were transfected with 100 ng RNA from mock-infected or T3D-infected cells. cell death 24 h following transfection was assessed by using cell Titer Glo system. Luminescence measurement in similarly treated cells transfected with 0 mM AC was considered to represent 100% viability. poly(IC) elicits necroptosis by TLR3 detection and signaling to RIP3 via TRIF (25, 26) we examined whether reovirus RNA-induced necroptosis could be blocked by the treatment of cells with ammonium chloride (AC), an agent that blocks the TLR3-mediated detection of dsRNA (54). BMDMs deficient in either both RLRs or MAVS were also protected from reovirus-induced necroptosis. these data suggest that necroptosis following reovirus infection requires detection and signaling by RLRs. detecting viral RNA by cytoplasmic sensors is required for necroptosis. cell death in wild-type, RIG-I/ MDA5/, or MAVS/ BMDMs treated with Z-VAD-FMK (25 M) following mock infection or infection with 50 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. Luminescence measurement in mock-infected cells of the same genotype was considered 100% viability. IFNAR-deficient BMDMs treated with Z-VAD-FMK were also resistant to reovirus-induced necroptosis. signaling via IFNAR is required for necroptosis (A to D) L929 cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell of T3D. levels of ZBP1 mRNA at 24 h postinfection were assessed by using RT-qPCR. cell death in wild-type and IFNAR-deficient BMDMs treated with Z-VAD-FMK following infection with 50 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by Sytox green staining. Luminescence measurement in mock-infected cells of the same genotype was considered to represent 100% viability. a parallel transfection of cells with reovirus RNA in control and AC-treated cells yielded results that matched those shown in Fig. 3I. the siRNA-mediated reduction in the expression of TRIF, the TLR3 adaptor, also did not block cell death following reovirus infection. GuHCl does not affect reovirus plus-strand RNA synthesis but prevents the generation of genomic dsRNA within infected cells. treatment of reovirus-infected cells with GuHCl led to a diminishment in necroptosis (Fig. 6D and E) cell death 48 h following mock infection or infection with 10 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. cell viability in similarly treated cells in the absence of TNF- and Z-VAD-FMK was considered 100%. reovirus S1 plus-strand RNA remained capable of eliciting the same level of IFN- mRNA expression as that of control infectious virus. results consistent with previously reported data showing IFN induction by a UV-inactivated reovirus mutant and IRF3 activation following reovirus infection in the absence of RNA synthesis. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed at the indicated time intervals. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR at 24 h postinfection. cells with 10 PFU/cell of T3D in the presence or absence of ribavirin were assessed by RT-qPCR. the IFN-/GAPDH ratio for untreated, T3D-infected, nontargeting siRNA-treated cells was set to a value of 1. reovirus induces necroptosis. cell death following reovirus infection of L929 cells exhibits features of necrosis. kinase activity of RIP1 can potentiate the activation of RIP3 to promote necroptosis (6). reovirus-induced cell death matched the effect of RIP3 siRNA on necroptosis-inducing treatment. death in L929 cells 48 h following mock infection or infection with 10 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. Luminescence measurement in similarly treated, uninfected cells was considered to represent 100% viability. whole-cell extracts from reovirus-infected cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated MLKL, total MLKL, and the PSTAIR loading control. RIP3-dependent necroptosis requires the activation of the effector protein MLKL (13\u201323) reovirus infects cells in a variety of tissues in newborn mice. reovirus can induce necroptosis in primary BMDMs. cells from wild-type mice were mock infected or infected with 50 PFU/cell of T3D in presence of DMSO, Z-VAD-FMK (25 M), Nec1 (50 M), or both inhibitors. cell death 48 h following infection was assessed by using cell Titer Glo. BMDMs from wild-type, RIP3/, or Casp8/ RIP3/ mice were infected with 50 PFU/cell of T3D in the presence or absence of Z-VAD-FMK (25 M). cell death 48 h following infection was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo system. the genetic absence of RIP3 enhanced the virus yield to 1.7 log10 units. apoptosis was blocked by using DMSO or Z-VAD-FMK. a blockade of apoptosis does not influence reovirus replication in cell culture. we purified total RNA from mock-infected cells 24 h following infection. RNA extracted from mock-infected cells induced a significantly larger amount of cell death following transfection into cells. cell death by transfected RNA was diminished by treatment with Nec1 but not Q-VD-OPh. 929 cells were transfected with 100 ng of RNA extracted from mock-infected cells. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR 18 h. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR. the ratio for cells transfected with untreated RNA from reovirus-infected cells was considered to have a value of 1. *, P 0.05 compared to cells transfected with untreated RNA from reovirus-infected cells. cells pretreated with 0 or 20 mM AC were transfected with 100 ng RNA from mock-infected or T3D-infected cells. cell death 24 h following transfection was assessed by using the cell Titer Glo system. poly(IC) elicits necroptosis by TLR3 detection and signaling to RIP3 via TRIF (25, 26). we examined whether reovirus RNA-induced necroptosis could be blocked by the treatment of cells with ammonium chloride (AC), an agent that blocks the TLR3-mediated detection of dsRNA (54). the detection of reovirus RNA via RIG-I results in IFN- expression. BMDMs deficient in either both RLRs or MAVS were also protected from reovirus-induced necroptosis. these data suggest that necroptosis following reovirus infection requires detection and signaling by RLRs. cell death in wild-type, RIG-I/ MDA5/, or MAVS/ BMDMs treated with Z-VAD-FMK (25 M) following mock infection or infection with 50 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by Sytox green staining. IFN signaling is required for necroptosis. signaling via IFNAR is required for necroptosis (A to D) L929 cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell of T3D in the presence of 0.1 g/ml of anti-IFNAR Ab. levels of ZBP1 mRNA at 24 h postinfection were assessed. cell death in wild-type and IFNAR-deficient BMDMs treated with Z-VAD-FMK was assessed by Sytox green staining. Luminescence measurement in mock-infected cells was considered to represent 100% viability. embly, we initiated infection of AC-treated cells with infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), a virus entry intermediate that bypasses the inhibitory effect of AC. a parallel transfection of cells with reovirus RNA in control and AC-treated cells yielded results that match those shown in Fig. 3I. the siRNA-mediated reduction in the expression of TRIF, the TLR3 adaptor, also did not block cell death following reovirus infection. treatment of reovirus-infected cells with GuHCl led to a diminishment in necroptosis. synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA is required for necroptosis. levels of reovirus plus-strand RNA corresponding to viral S1 gene segment were measured by RT-qPCR. death 48 h following mock infection or infection with 10 PFU/cell of T3D was assessed by AOEB staining. cell viability in similarly treated cells in the absence of TNF- and Z-VAD-FMK was considered 100%. the time during infection when reovirus RNA is detected to produce IFN- is not known. genomic RNA present within incoming viral particles is sufficient for induction of IFN- expression. results consistent with previously reported data showing IFN induction by a UV-inactivated reovirus mutant and IRF3 activation following reovirus infection in the absence of RNA synthesis. levels of IFN- mRNA were assessed by RT-qPCR at 24 h postinfection. levels of reovirus plus-strand RNA corresponding to the viral S1 gene segment were measured by RT-qPCR at 24 h postinfection. the IFN-/GAPDH ratio for untreated, T3D-infected, nontargeting siRNA-treated cells was set to a value of 1. *, P 0.05 compared to untreated, T3D-infected, nontargeting siRNA-treated cells. reovirus infection of both cultured cells and primary murine macrophages evokes necroptosis. multiple ISGs are implicated in the induction of necroptosis. these include ZBP1/DAI, which may sense either viral DNA, viral RNA, or viral proteins. reovirus remained capable of inducing cell death in ZBP1-deficient BMDMs. reovirus-induced necroptosis requires MAVS and IFNAR. reovirus-induced necroptosis requires ZBP1 (27, 28) but is not affected by the absence of ZBP1. the precise pathway that executes cell death likely varies by cell type. reovirus is currently in phase III clinical trials as a cancer therapeutic. the capacity of reovirus to elicit cell death via multiple mechanisms may therefore underlie its efficacy. spinner-adapted L929 cells were used for cultivating and purifying viruses and for plaque assays. prototype reovirus strain T3D was regenerated by plasmid-based reverse genetics. antisera raised against reovirus obtained from T. Dermody. monoclonal antibody against IFNAR and rabbit antisera against RIP3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cells were washed twice with PBS, triedpsinized, pelleted for 5 min at 800 g, and washed again with fresh medium. cells were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide diluted in sodium cacodylate buffer. cells were then stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate diluted in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.2) Thin sections of uninfected and infected cells were collected by using a diamond knife on a microtome. the stained grids were analyzed by using a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. cells were mock infected or infected with 10 PFU/cell of T3D for 24 h. total RNA was extracted by using Tri reagent. cell death measured 21 to 24 h following transfection. membranes were scanned by using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor) membranes were scanned by using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor) Knockdown of host proteins by siRNA. cells (1 104) were seeded on top of the siRNA-Lipofectamine mixture. fewer than 5% of uninfected cells were EB positive following treatment with each inhibitor or siRNA. the cells were imaged over a time course of 48 h. 0.5 to 2 g of RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers or gene-specific primers. CT values for each cDNA sample were calculated by subtracting the threshold cycle (CT) values for T3DS1, ZBP1 or IFN- from the CT values for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) vir was generated by using a UV cross-linker (CL-1000 UV cross-linker; UVP) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline was placed into a 60-mm tissue culture dish and irradiated with short-wave (254-nm) UV on ice at a distance of 10 cm for 1 min at 120,000 J/cm2. monoclonal antibody against IFNAR and rabbit antisera against RIP3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. those against TRIF, phospho-MLKL, and total MLKL were purchased from Abcam. mouse antiserum specific for PSTAIR was purchased from Sigma. tetroxide diluted in sodium cacodylate buffer for 60 min at room temperature. cells were stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate diluted in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.2) after staining, cells were washed twice with 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.2) or T3D at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with medium at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. cells were lysed in 1 RIPA buffer supplemented with 10 mM NaF.
