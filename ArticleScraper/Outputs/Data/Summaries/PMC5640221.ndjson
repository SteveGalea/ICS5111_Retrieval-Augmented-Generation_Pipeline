{"summary": "a new strain of coronavirus strain was isolated from his lung tissue. a new strain of coronavirus was isolated from a 49-year-old male. the genome of the new coronavirus was sequenced and deposited in the Genebank database under the number JX869059, KC164505.2. MERS-CoV is mainly spreading across the geographical region of the Middle East. only sporadic cases are reported in the Europe, North America, Africa, and lately Asia. the typical seasonality pattern is not seen in case of MERS-CoV infections. the gold standard for diagnosis is detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. the virus is found to be present in different diagnostic specimens such as the lower respiratory tract, sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, upper respiratory tract, nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, urine, feces and blood. a total of 1797 confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported worldwide between June 2012 and July 2016. the regional distribution of MERS-CoV was as follows: Middle East had the highest number cases (88.4%), followed by Asia (10.7%), Europe (0.8%) and USA with only 2 cases officially reported. 147 cases (8.2%) were still reported with no exposure to any of the above. the exposure data were found missing for the remaining 537 (29.9%) patients. the majority of MERS-CoV infections (93%) reported between the time period from June 2012 to July 2016 were from Saudi Arabia. the remaining 5 GCC countries contributed only 7% of the cases with the distributions as follows. most of the cases (52%) were reported in al Riyadh region, making it the worst hit area in the country followed by Makkah (20%), Ash Sharqiyah (11%), Al Madinah (4%) and Najran (3%). the remaining 9 regions together contributed to 5% of the cases. the first case was reported form the capital (Kuwait city) on October 2010, followed by 2 other reported cases, one each in 2013 and 2014. the last case, again reported from Kuwait city, was a 78-year-old male who developed symptom on the 8th of September, 2014. the first case was a 68-year-old patient from Dakhliyah Governorate who was tested and found positive on October 29, 2013. a 37-year-old expat male from Abu Dhabi developed symptoms on the 9th of June, 2016 and was later tested positive for MERS-CoV. the average of the reported cases during this 4 years period shows that 60\u201380 cases are reported in the period between February and May, while about 90\u2013100 are reported in August and September. 147 cases (8.2%) were still reported with no exposure to any of the above. the exposure data were found missing for the remaining 537 (29.9%) patients. the majority of MERS-CoV infections (93%) reported between the time period from June 2012 to July 2016 were from Saudi Arabia. the remaining 5 GCC countries contributed only 7% of the cases with the distributions as follows. most of the cases (52%) were reported in al Riyadh region, making it the worst hit area in the country followed by Makkah (20%), Ash Sharqiyah (11%), Al Madinah (4%) and Najran (3%). the remaining 9 regions together contributed to 5% of the cases. the first case was reported form the capital (Kuwait city) on October 2010, followed by 2 other reported cases, one each in 2013 and 2014. the last case, again reported from Kuwait city, was a 78-year-old male who developed symptom on the 8th of September, 2014. the first case was a 68-year-old patient from Dakhliyah Governorate who was tested and found positive on October 29, 2013, with a history of no camel contact. a 37-year-old expat male from Abu Dhabi developed symptoms on the 9th of June, 2016 and was later tested positive for MERS-CoV. most of the cases were reported in al Riyadh region, making it the worst hit area in the country followed by Makkah (20%), Ash Sharqiyah (11%), Al Madinah (4%) and Najran (3%) the remaining 9 regions together contributed to 5% of the cases. a total of 4 cases were confirmed as MERS-CoV infections. the first case was reported form the capital (Kuwait city) on October 2010, followed by 2 other reported cases, one each in 2013 and 2014. the last case, again reported from Kuwait city, was a 78-year-old male who developed symptom on the 8th of September, 2014 and was tested positive for MERS-CoV. the average of the reported cases during this 4 years period shows that 60\u201380 cases are reported in the period between February and May, while about 90\u2013100 are reported in August and September. a low point of infection occurs in the period of October\u2014January and another one in June. the highest number of cases were reported overall during the summer time. over one third (37.5%) of patients received intensive care among all hospitalized cases. the hot climate shared by Arabian Peninsula and sub-saharan africa region could contribute to the spread of MERS-CoV infections across these geographical regions. sporadic cases could be the presence of senescence-associated immune vulnerability in these individuals and suboptimal immune reactivity following a systemic challenge by exposure to MERS-CoV natural infection. there may be still other factors involved that remain hidden at present but contribute significantly to the survival, transmission and pathogenesis of this relatively newly identified pathogen. the availability detailed reports of each and every case of MERS-CoV infection globally will provide valuable information to the scientific community that may be used to track, contain, and eradicate this disease."}
