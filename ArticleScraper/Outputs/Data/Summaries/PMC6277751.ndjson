{"summary": "the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections could be worse in developing countries, including china. the etiology of respiratory infection in the adult population has been overlooked, at least in China. there are plenty of reports on the epidemiology of respiratory viral infection in the pediatric population. human adenovirus is one of the common pathogens in respiratory infections. the most recent reported human adenovirus type is type 85 in species D. adenoviral infections in children from Harbin were found to be ADV species B. the hexon protein is the major neutralizing antigen of adenoviruses. the hyper variable region (HVR) in hexon protein hosts its type specific epitopes. the replacement of HVRs in hexon could alter viral serotypes. all patients enrolled in this study lived in urban and suburban areas of Harbin without travel histories within 3 months before admission and sampling. the sputum samples were expectorated spontaneously into sterile containers and delivered to the laboratory within 2 h, tested immediately or stored at -80\u00b0C prior to use. infected cells were amplified using the AxyPrep Multisource Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and eluted in 100 l elution buffer. PCR was performed with the Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) ed daily average temperature curve according to the national standard no: QX/T 152-2012. spring starts when the daily average temperature permanently rose above 10\u00b0C. summer comes when it rose above 22\u00b0C permanently. the winter starts at 10\u00b0C. sputum samples were collected from 1,300 adult patients hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections in the second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. all patients lived in urban and suburban areas of Harbin without travel histories within 3 months before admission and sampling. cultures with ADV-like cytopathic effects were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 days. if there was no observed cytopathic effect, two additional blind passages of the culture were performed to avoid false negative results. the daily average air temperature from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2017 in Harbin city was provided by the Harbin Meteorological Observatory. climate seasons were determined based on the smoothed daily average temperature curve according to the Chinese national standard No: QX/T 152-2012 (Administration, 2012). spring starts when the daily average temperature permanently rose above 10\u00b0C, while summer comes when it rose above 22\u00b0C permanently. the unrooted Neighbor-Joining tree was reconstructed using the kimura 2 parameters distance. the parsimony tree was also built on the same dataset. the age of the population in this study varied from 18 to 97 years old. 70 360(27.7) 43(22.8) 317(28.5) Surveillance year 0.017 2014 299(23.0)

with bronchitis had fever (P 0.001) cases were determined to be positive with at least one of seven viruses. double infections were observed in 43 cases, while triple infection was found in six cases.

only symptom that showed statistically significant difference (p = 0.011) between the positive (38.1%, 72/189) and negative (48.1%, 534/1111) group of viral infections. median days in the hospital for the positive viral infection group was 12 (IQR 9\u201317), which was shorter than 13 in the negative group. overall, the viral detection rate was relatively lower in the chronic diseases group (11.7% vs. 16.9%) the overall detection rate of viral infection among hospitalized adult patients in this report is 14.5%. the dominant viral pathogen throughout this study period was PIV, with a detection rate of 7.2% followed by influenza virus. influenza virus had the highest detection rate of 8.0% in adult patients. this report showed that the PIV dominated epidemic seasons from 2014 to 2017 in adult patients in Harbin. this report showed that the PIV dominated epidemic seasons from 2014 to 2017 in adult patients in Harbin. hBoV (Human bocavirus), HMPV (Human metapneumovirus), HCoV (Human coronavirus), HRV (Human Rhinoviruses), \u201c-\u201d, not reported. asthma is related to viral infection, while detection rates varies among different pathogens. detecting respiratory virus in sputum samples has been proven effective on a small scale. this report provided a medium scale test on the validity or effectiveness of respiratory viral detection from sputum samples with 1,300 cases. two nearly identical strains were isolated from pneumonia patients in Harbin, possessing high similarity with the local strain Harbin04B and the strain GB. the enrolled population in this study consisted of adult patients only, while the samples from pediatric patients were not collected simultaneously. the bacterial culture results of the clinical samples were not included in this report, which prevents us from drawing a comprehensive picture."}
