{"summary": "secondary cases defined as those likely resulting from contact with a MERS-CoV-infected individual or contact with a setting associated with MERS-CoV transmission. cases were labeled unknown if available information was insufficient to determine a classification. 143 cases of MERS-CoV were reported by the SA MoH and CDC. median age of cases was 58 (range 2, 99) years, 91 (64%) were male, and 124 (87%) were of Saudi nationality. case fatality rate was 43%. a case with the 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion in open reading frame (ORF)5 is marked with. Clade-credibility values 70% are indicated above the respective nodes. number in brackets after some strain identifiers are the number of identical sequences with the same geographic location and sample collection year/month. 8 (6%) of 143 cases were classified as sporadic after telephone interview. sporadic cases ranged in age from 35 to 91 years, 7 of 8 were male. residence was reported from 6 regions: 3 from Riyadh and 1 each from Makkah, Eastern, Qasim, Asir, and Najran. deletion would predict a 147-aa protein consisting of the amino-terminal 129 aa of ORF5 plus 18 non-ORF5 residues prematurely terminating in an out-of-frame stop codon. no definitive link to camels was identified for this patient; however, the patient was deceased and the interview was conducted with a relative. a single unique deletion in ORF5 of the sequence from 1 patient mirrors a recent report by Lamers et al [11] that identified deletion mutations in ORF3 and ORF4a among MERS-CoVs obtained from an outbreak cluster in Jordan, 2015. the possible effect of the ORF5 frameshift mutation on the clinical course of infection in this particular patient is unknown. the 8 cases we classified as sporadic were not available for sequencing. we were unable to determine transmission chains and locations of transmission. additional cases linked to Hospital A outside of our defined study period were not included in the analysis."}
