{"summary": "wild boars are potential carriers of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases that can affect livestock, wildlife, and humans. the disease-status of Saskatchewan\u2019s wild boar population is unknown. wild boars are closely related to domestic swine. s were submitted from 7 hunts; in 2014, 6 boars were submitted from 2 hunts. boars were either as full carcasses or as tissue portions collected by hunters and/or conservation officers. blood was centrifuged and the serum extracted within 24 h of collection. in 2014, boars were also tested for influenza A virus by PCR. feces were tested via routine fecal flotation for parasites. samples were tested using commercially available kits. the PRRS PCR was performed using a commercial kit (Tetracore, Rockville, Maryland, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the nested PCR protocol used 20 pmol primer pairs and 4 L of template as described (9), but was modified to a 50 L reaction mix with the following master mix concentration changes. in 2009, 22 boars were submitted from 3 separate hunts; in 2013, 53 boars were submitted from 7 hunts; and in 2014, 6 boars were submitted from 2 hunts. blood was collected from the heart or jugular vein as soon as possible after death by hunters and/or conservation officers. illus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii were tested for influenza A virus by PCR in 2014. in all years, feces, when available, were tested via routine fecal flotation for parasites. the PRRS PCR was performed using a commercial kit (Tetracore, Rockville, Maryland, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the PCV-2 PCR and Influenza A virus matrix gene PCR were performed as previously described (7,8) 22 boars from 3 hunts in 2009, 53 boars from 7 hunts in 2013, and 6 boars from 2 hunts in 2014. 79 boars were killed in or near Moose Mountain Provincial Park, and 2 were killed near Melfort, Saskatchewan. all wild boars tested for A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 were either suspect or positive for serotype 13. all wild boars were frequently positive for > 1 serotype with 70% (14/20) positive for 2 or more serotypes. ND 0 (0/20) Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) serotypes present in 20 wild boars from Saskatchewan surveyed in 2013 Serotype Positive Suspect APP 1 (9,11) 0 0 APP 5a,5b 0 0 APP 2 0 0 APP 3 (6,8,15) 5 0 APP 7 (4) 1 0 APP 10 4 0 APP 12 15 1 APP 13 1 3 APP two boars were submitted as full carcasses with serum samples, 36 as full carcasses without serum samples, 21 as tissue samples without serum, and 9 as serum samples alone. fourteen of the boars were identified as adults, 31 as immature and 36 were not classified according to age; 27 were male, 48 were female and gender was unspecified for 6 animals. all wild boars that were tested for A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 were either suspect or positive for serotype 13. all 20 boars that were tested for A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 were either positive for TTV. ND 0% (20/20) Lawsonia intracellularis ND 80% (16/20) ND 5% (1/20) positive; 30% (6/20) suspicious PCV-2 \u2014 Porcine circovirus 2; PRRSV \u2014 Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; TGEV/PRCV \u2014 Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus; ND \u2014 testing not done. there are only 2 ways these boars could have become infected. contact with infected domestic swine, which would require close contact between the 2 species, or infection in the original escaped individuals. the high prevalence of serotype 14 is common in Europe but has not been previously reported in North America. the difference in the predominant serotypes between wild boars and domestic swine suggests that thus far there has been minimal or no transmission of A. pleuropneumonia between wild boars and domestic swine. the presence of antibodies that are likely against the atypical strain of serotype 13 may, at least in part, be due to cross contamination with domestic pigs. the absence of detection of PCV-2 contrasts with studies in the USA where PCV-2 infection is common in domestic swine in Canada. the current relatively low wild boar densities in Saskatchewan may also be contributing to the low PCV-2 prevalence. no previous studies have looked for TTV in wild boar in north America. wild boar specific TTSuV strains are capable of undergoing recombination events with TTSuV strains in domestic swine allowing the rapid emergence of novel strains. in the u.s. wild boar generally have a high T. gondii seroprevalence in comparison to other species (3). consumption of wild boar has caused outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in humans (3). none of the 22 boars tested had detectable larvae in their tongues or diaphragms. in canada, domestic swine are Trichinella-free and Canadian wildlife are not thought to carry T. spiralis (33). fortunately, wild boars are less readily infected with other Trichinella spp. than with T. spiralis and in experimental infections of wild boar there is establishment of only moderate numbers of T. pseudospiralis larvae. metastrongylus spp. are highly prevalent in wild boar in Europe and the southern USA (35) transmission of metastrongylus spp. to domestic swine is very unlikely, given the low prevalence in wild boar and indoor housing of commercial animals. wild boar population has low prevalence of diseases of concern to humans and domestic animals. increased sample sizes and sampling of wild boar from other areas of the province are needed to demonstrate the absence of disease."}
