{"summary": "compare genomes using only partial genomic information. graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting, and comparing various gene structures. this is an attractive and promising research direction. new two-dimensional graphical representation of gene sequences9 has no circuit or degeneracy. in this way, the original DNA sequence can be recovered from its graph mathematically without loss of biological information. in Fig. 2, we give the graphical representation of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of human, common chimpanzee, Norway rat, and hedgehog. these four DNA sequence graphical curves have no circuits or degeneracy and the correspondence between sequence and graphical curve can be mathematically proved to be one-to-one. we can compute a sequence of numbers 1 y1, 2 y2,..., n yn. if we know the sequence of numbers 1 y1, 2 y2,..., n yn, we can recover the graph (1, y1), (2, y2),..., (n, yn) each of which uses the global information of the sequence of numbers 1 y1, 2 y2,..., n yn. xi is the x-coordinate value of ith nucleotide on a DNA graph. xi should be equal to i. yi is the y-coordinate value of ith nucleotide on a DNA graph. the next step is to obtain yi from moment vector. the position of kth nucleotide on a graph (xk+1, yk+1) can be represented as (k + 1, yk + uk+1), where uk+1 may be any of y-coordinate value of the four nucleotides. zk+1 = xk+1 yk+1 = (k + 1) (yk + uk+1) = (k yk) + (1 uk+1) (k yk) we can use the first N components (M1, M2,..., MN) of the moment vector of a genome sequence graph to represent a genome as a point in an N-dimensional space. thus, we obtain an N-dimensional genome space as a subspace in RN. for circular single-strand genomes, we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. the two strands of some genomes are differentiated by their nucleotide content. the two strands have different masses because one has a higher proportion of heavier nucleic acids. in this case, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) genomes to make the genome space. X-value stands for the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence. X-value stands for the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence. human and common chimpanzee are very close (more than 1600 nt) theorem Consider the set of DNA sequences having the same number (n) of nucleotides. the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its moment vector is one-to-one. xi is the x-coordinate value of ith nucleotide on a DNA graph. j and zi are roots of the polynomial Let sd (d = 1, 2,..., n) be the elementary symmetric polynomials in z1, z2,..., zn, i.e.,,,, sn = z1z2zn, then s1 = an1, s2 = an2,..., sn = (1)na0. y-coordinate values of four nucleotides are between \u20131 and zk = xk yk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk = k yk, zk+1 zk = k yk = k yk, for circular single-strand genomes, we use the first N components (M1, M2,..., MN) of this normalized moment vector to represent a genome as a point in an N-dimensional space. so, we obtain an N-dimensional genome space as a subspace in RN. new methods for phylogenetic inference using biological sequences can be divided into two groups. the algorithms in the first group utilize various distance measures12\u201315 which are based on different models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement. the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating of different topologies. phylogenetic tree of mitochondrial genome sequences of 35 mammal species was reconstructed by the first 60 components of the moment vector (M1, M2,..., Mn) this tree was reconstructed by the first 60 components of the moment vector (M1, M2,..., Mn) to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space. reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) it was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different SIVs and therefore have different evolutionary origins. a single-gene sequence does not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms. the sequence graphs of the genomes of the 33 lentiviruses were obtained. they can be viewed as 33 points in a 12-dimensional genome space. both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 lineages fall within that of the SIVs which are isolated from other primates. our suggestion coincides with those found by Gao et al.26. for HIV-2, we find that the HIV-1 group O is closely related to the just one of these SIVcpz lineages, found in P. t. schweinfurthii. to study the classification and phylogeny of coronaviruses clearly, we apply our genome space to a large set of 30 complete coronavirus genomes from GenBank. the two newly sequenced human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, along with four genomes from Flaviviridae and Togaviridae which are not coronaviruses. four groups, group 1, group 2, group 3, and outgroups can be seen in this figure as four distinct clusters. to study the classification for coronavirus clearly, we expanded it and obtained Fig. 5B. complete genome/Group 3 EU095850 TCoV 27 657 Turkey coronavirus isolate MG10, complete genome/Group 3 AY278488 BJ01 29 725 SARS coronavirus BJ01, complete genome/Group 4 AY278741 Urbani 29 727 SARS coronavirus Urbani. complete genome/Group 4 AY278491 HKU-39849 29 742 SARS coronavirus HKU-39849, complete genome/Group 4 coronaviruses are divided into three distinct groups. human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a group 1 coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is a group 2 coronavirus. newly discovered human coronavirus NL63 is very close to the human coronavirus 229E, and thus it is classified into group 1. this result coincides with those found by van der Hoek et al.27 and Wang et al.29. HCoV-HKU1 belongs to a new group 5. we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses. this tree was reconstructed by the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2). phylogenetic tree of coronavirus genomes was reconstructed by the first 20 components of the moment vector (M1, M2,..., M20) this tree was reconstructed by the first 20 components of the moment vector (M1, M2,..., M20) the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged. phylogenetic analysis based on gene order requires detailed complex gene order data in genomes and intensive computation. we choose the human mitochondrion genome and then invert its two genes ATPase 6 and Cytochrome oxidase III to get a simulated genome. we randomly generate a genome sequence which has the same length and nucleotide content as the human mitochondrion genome, which we called random genome. the genome spaces constructed by the moment vector have advantages over the gene order phylogenetic analysis. we will apply the moment vector method on the detailed phylogenetic analysis using the large-scale genomic rearrangement data. among different genomes via viewing the graph of genome space."}
