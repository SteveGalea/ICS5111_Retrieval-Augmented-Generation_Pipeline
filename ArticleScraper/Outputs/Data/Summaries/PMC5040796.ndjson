{"summary": "an estimated 370 million people worldwide are infected with S. stercoralis. this longevity of Strongyloides is related to its unique and complex life cycle with its alternation between free-living and parasitic cycles. esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed mild reflux esophagitis. sigmoidoscopy showed no significant changes. rectal biopsy revealed chronic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltrates. no parasites were identified. portable chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates. CT scan revealed bilateral centrilobular nodules of ground glass opacity. there was no clinical or radiological improvement despite repeated ultrafiltration sessions. repeated sputum analysis and BAL specimen were negative for parasites. he was started on oral ivermectin 200 g/kg once daily for two weeks. his weight increased by 11 kg, pulmonary infiltrates regressed on CXR. strongyloidiasis is uncommon in Saudi Arabia. graft-related infection is increasingly reported from the Middle East. three Kuwaiti kidney transplant recipients died within 2 months from hyperinfection. the most common finding in HRCT scans included bilateral mixed areas of ground glass opacity, poorly defined centrilobular small nodules, and consolidation. hypersensitivity and superimposed bacterial infection could have contributed to the radiological changes that regressed prior to discharge. peripheral eosinophilia was present in only 12/73 cases (16.4%) of disseminated infection. the absence of eosinophilia while receiving corticosteroid therapy cannot reliably exclude underlying Strongyloides infection. serological methods are the most sensitive available diagnostic tools. a variety of antigens have been used to develop serological tests. a number of studies demonstrated high sensitivity with specificity of >90% in most of reports."}
