{"summary": "the family of natriuretic peptides exert important and diverse actions for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. the autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B) PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. results demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP. PDI has dithiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activities which can reduce, oxidize, and isomerize disulfide bonds. previous studies have identified PDI at the plasma membrane of lymphocytes, platelets, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and some cancer cells. human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2) with supplements (Lonza, Hopkinton, MA) primary human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) were grown in mesangial growth media with supplements (Cell Systems Inc.) primary cells from passage 3 to 7 were used in this study. siRNA transfection HMCs were seeded in 6-well plates at 1105 cells/cm2. the next day, 8 l of siRNA or scrambled oligomers (10 M) were diluted in 100 l siRNA transfection medium. 6 l of the siRNA transfection agent were diluted into 100 l siRNA transfection medium in separate tubes. protein concentrations of cell lysates and membrane fractions were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad) samples were aliquoted and kept at 80\u00b0C until use. western blotting was used to identify PDI in cellular proteins. 500 l of the solubilized membrane fraction containing 300 g of protein was incubated with 1 g of anti-GC-A, anti-GC-B antibodies or rabbit IgG for 4 hours to overnight at 4\u00b0C. the immune complexes were trapped on protein A/G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times with PBS, then boiled in sample loading buffer for 5 minutes. PDI was visualized using goat anti-rabbit Ab AF 488 1500. GC-B was visualized using goat anti-mouse AF 594 (Molecular Probes) cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma) primary human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) were grown in mesangial growth medium (EGM-2) with supplements (Lonza), LLC-PK1 cells were grown in dullbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium (DMEM). primary cells from passage 3 to 7 were used in this study. the next day, 8 l of siRNA or scrambled oligomers (10 M) were diluted in 100 l siRNA transfection medium. 6 l of the siRNA transfection agent were diluted into 100 l siRNA transfection medium in separate tubes. the two mixtures were combined, mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes. Membrane fractions of HMCs were prepared with the ProteoExtract Native Membrane Protein Extraction kit. samples were aliquoted and kept at 80\u00b0C until use. western blotting was used to identify PDI in cellular proteins. immunoprecipitation Membrane fractions from HMCs were solubilized with CHAPS Immunoprecipitation Buffer (FIVEphoton Biochemicals) 500 l of the solubilized membrane fraction containing 300 g of protein was incubated with 1 g of anti-GC-A, anti-GC-B antibodies or rabbit IgG for 4 hours to overnight at 4\u00b0C. PDI was visualized using goat anti-rabbit Ab AF 488 1500. GC-B was visualized using goat anti-mouse AF 594. cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma) bacitracin inhibited PDI attenuates NP-mediated generation of cGMP in vascular cells. bacitracin inhibited PDI attenuates NPs activation in vascular cells. new tab A shows partial knockdown of PDI in HMCs. data are expressed as mean+SEM vs control cells without PDI siRNA treatment. PDI inhibition by RL90 decreases ANP, BNP and CNP-mediated cGMP generation in HMC. expression of PDI was not detected on LLC-PK1 cells. B. Bacitracin had no effect on cGMP generation of LLP-CK1 cells stimulated by ANP. ANP showed moderate binding with PDI (Fig. 2B) while BNP had the highest binding affinity with PDI. the mean equilibrium dissociation constant for ANP was 125 nM, compared to 35 nM for BNP. PDI regulation of natriuretic peptide-mediated cGMP generation may be mediated through its effects on GC-A and GC-B. PDI regulation of NP-mediated cGMP stimulation in vitro. bacitracin inhibited PDI attenuates NP-mediated generation of cGMP in vascular cells. bacitracin inhibited PDI attenuates NPs activation in vascular cells. PDI inhibition by RL90 decreases ANP, BNP and CNP-mediated cGMP generation in HMCs. similar results were seen with cGMP stimulation by natriuretic peptides. expression of PDI was not detected on LLC-PK1 cells. B. Bacitracin had no effect on cGMP generation of LLP-CK1 cells stimulated by ANP. ANP showed moderate binding with PDI, while BNP had the highest binding affinity with PDI. the mean equilibrium dissociation constant for ANP was 125 nM. the mean equilibrium dissociation constant for ANP was 125 nM, compared to 35 nM for BNP. these studies suggest that PDI co-localizes with GC-A and GC-B in HUVEC and HMC respectively. PDI regulation of natriuretic peptide-mediated cGMP generation may be mediated through its effects on GC-A and GC-B. LLC-PK1 cells lack detectable PDI expression. addition of purified PDI to LLC-PK1 cells increased the ability of NP to stimulate cGMP. this suggests that PDI activity is not required in NP stimulated cGMP. the binding of ANP to the ECD affects GC-A homodimer quaternary structure. the quaternary structure of ECD is critical for the function (ligand binding and activation) of natriuretic peptide receptors. Figure S2 Bacitracin treatment does not affect GC-B expression on HMC. cGMP levels of ANP and CNP stimulated HMCs with and without bacitracin(Ba) there was no difference in GC-B expression with exposure to Ba."}
