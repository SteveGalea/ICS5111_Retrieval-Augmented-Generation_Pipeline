{"summary": "standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. the increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level. gene-level analysis ignores the difference between mRNA variants. diversity of genes is much higher than that of transcripts encoded by the same gene. alternative splicing increases mRNA diversity and over 60% of human genes are involved. the correctness of the suffix system has been in doubt [14,18] therefore it is not reliable to perform transcript-level analysis on the basis of this imperfect suffix system. we linked the probesets of two widely used Affymetrix arrays with the IPIs [20,21] through proper association and rigorous alignment procedures. probesets 22690 22283 Non-control probesets 22626 22215 Probesets associated with protein-coding mRNAs (Investigated probesets) 21097 16213 Probesets passing BLAST (Annotated probesets) 18894 (probeset retaining percentage: 83.5% of the non-control, 89.6% of the investigated) 15288 (probeset retaining percentage: 68.8% of the non-control, the proportion of genes covered by our annotated probesets to those covered by all non-control probesets are higher than the corresponding probeset retaining percentages. this is in support of our primary goal, that is to refine gene-level probeset annotations to transcript-level, but not simply remove the poor-quality gene-level annotations. the first two groups are comparable to our one-to-one and one-to-many probesets respectively. however, our one-to-one type accounts for only 53.7% and 43.3%. this suggests that some of _at probesets are not really specific for a transcript. the Affymetrix _a_at/_s_at group contains 42.0% one-to-one probesets. we attributed this to the trimming of the originally false transcripts during the update of sequence information. transcript-level synonymous probesets were supposed to be more consistent than those of gene-level synonymous probesets. transcript-level synonymous probesets were also named as protein-level synonymous probesets. probeset-protein mapping tables provided at NetAffx were used as comparison. the correlations of synonymous groups for 30 datasets at three different levels were depicted in parallel in Figure 1A. the synonymous probesets at Affy-protein level show higher correlations than those at gene level. the synonymous ones based on our protein level annotation show even higher correlations consistently over 30 datasets. the array and the cDNA sequences from the sample filtered the blast results according to a cutoff of E-value. a similar comparison was conducted for HG-U133A array, involving another transcript-level annotation by Harbig et al. three probesets were mapped to the mouse Prlr gene (GeneID: 19116). the first probeset correlating to protein IPI00321091, or PRL-R3, and the other two correlating to protein IPI00408593, or PRL-R2 showed similar expression profiles as expected. three probesets on the array MOE430A_2 are associated with the mouse gene Prlr. Probeset 1448556_at correlates to protein IPI00321091, or PRL-R3. probesets 1421382_at and 1451844_at both point to protein IPI00408593, or PRL-R2. reports on expression regulation of these two transcript variants of gene Alg14, and no function reports of the corresponding protein isoforms. this negative correlation suggested that these two proteins might perform different roles thus should be distinct annotated. many studies integrate other data sources into the functional characterization of PPI. the four probesets, Pst_a1, Pst_a2, Pst_b1, and Pst_b2, recognize transcript variants Ta1, Ta2, Tb1 and Tb2 respectively, producing proteins Pa1, Pa2, Pb1 and Pb2. the other three cross-gene pairs, (Pst_a1, Pst_b1), (Pst_a1, Pst_b2) and (Pst_a2, Pst_b2) pairs for all available 1,037 interactions evaluated the statistical significance of these PCC values under one-tailed t-test. we estimated the corresponding false discovery rates (FDR) using the SPLOSH FDR estimation method. x-axis indicates the PCC values of PPI pairs vs. those of corresponding GGI pairs. y-axis indicates the PCC values of the corresponding GGI pairs. a linear regression resulted in a regression line and a regression formula, which were shown in green. observations were made over all 28 datasets (see Additional file 4 and Additional file 5). based on these lists, we counted the significantly correlated PPIs or GGIs over each dataset, and the datasets on which a PPI or GGI demonstrates significant correlation (termed 'PPI-significant datasets' or 'GGI-significant datasets' 'Significant PPIs' are pairs detected by the PPI calculation. 'Significant GGIs' are those detected by the GGI calculation. table 5. Number of datasets on which a PPI or GGI demonstrate significant correlation.

'Affy-protein' level synonymous probesets were compiled at three different levels. expression correlations of all synonymous groups at one level were then averaged into an overall value for a dataset. the correlations of synonymous groups at one level were then averaged into an overall value. hybridization takes place between the probe sequences immobilized on the array and the cDNA sequences from the sample. in microarray experiment hybridization takes place between the probe sequences immobilized on the array and the cDNA sequences from the sample. mRNA sequences were mapped to the mouse Prlr gene (GeneID: 19116). the first probeset correlating to protein IPI00321091, or PRL-R3, and the other two correlating to protein IPI00408593, or PRL-R2 showed similar expression profiles as expected. three probesets on the array MOE430A_2 are associated with the mouse gene Prlr. probeset 1448556_at correlates to protein IPI00321091, or PRL-R3; probesets 1421382_at and 1451844_at both point to protein IPI00408593. expressions of these two variants are negatively correlated with PCC values of -0.7740 (P = 5.04e-5) for 1419116_at and 1419115_at, and -0.4402 (P = 0.0296) for 1419116_at and 1419114_at. this negative correlation suggested that these two proteins might perform different roles thus should be distinct annotated. the four probesets, Pst_a1, Pst_a2, and Pst_b2, recognize transcript variants Ta1, Ta2, Tb1 and Tb2 respectively, producing proteins Pa1, Pa2, Pb1 and Pb2 respectively. the other three cross-gene pairs, (Pst_a1, Pst_b1), (Pst_a1, Pst_b2) and (Pst_a2, Pst_b2), were also included ed in Figure 3, the probeset pairs corresponding to all possible cross-gene protein pairs are termed as GGI pairs. we calculated PCCs of both PPI pairs and GGI pairs for all available 1,037 interactions. we evaluated the statistical significance of these PCC values under one-tailed t-test. 1,037 interacting protein pairs from the HPRD were analyzed based on the GEO dataset GDS987. x-axis indicates the PCC values of PPI pairs, and y-axis indicates the PCC values of the corresponding GGI pairs. the PPI PCC calculation preserves the original positive or negative correlation tendency revealed by the conventional GGI PCC calculation, and strengthens it with larger absolute correlation values. similar observations were made over all 28 datasets (see Additional file 4 and Additional file 5). 1257 54 26 GDS1259 20 4 GDS1282 84 24 GDS1321 121 18 2 GDS266 7 0 GDS268 3 0 GDS395 476 35 GDS558 160 26 GDS564 13 0 GDS596 737 455 GDS690 462 163 GDS715 866 754 GDS737 7 1 GDS760 109 19 GDS810 33 4 GDS914 13 1 GDS946 22 5 G only PPI pairs with more than 14 'PPI-significant datasets' datasets are shown. the full table is provided in Additional file 6 and Additional file 7. a major trend among these efforts was to redefine probesets so that probes matching the same molecular target were placed into custom probesets. this strategy may be used to make distinction precisely at the level of genes, but not at the level of transcripts or splice variants. one-to-null probesets that do not recognize any transcript. one-to-many probesets that hybridize to multiple alternative transcript variants of the intended gene. alternative solution to the problematic standard annotation points out a new way to improve the interpretation and exploitation of Affymetrix microarray data. new field in bioinformatics and several recent large-scale studies have shown that alternative splicing can be analyzed in a high-throughput manner using DNA-microarray methods. most of these studies used arrays particularly manufactured for analyzing alternative splicing, such as genomic tiling array and exon-exon junction array. over 40% of all probesets could be mapped to transcripts in a one-to-one manner, so our work strongly validate that it is feasible to analyze alternative splicing using traditional gene expression arrays. re-annotated two popular Affymetrix gene expression arrays, MOE430_2 and HG-U133A, in a transcript-level perspective. Affymetrix 3' eukaryotic gene expression analysis arrays MOE430A_2 and HG-U133A were selected for this study. corresponding annotation files, 'Mouse430A_2_annot_csv.zip' and 'HG-U133A_annot_csv.zip' were downloaded from affymetrix website. mapping relationships between RefSeq mRNA accessions, RefSeq protein accessions, and Entrez GeneIDs were extracted from related flat files'mouse.rna.gbff.gz' and 'human.rna.gbff.gz', which were downloaded from RefSeq in April 2006. we downloaded 68,035 human PPIs from HPRD and 12,301 from HPRD. transcript-level annotation of the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array was obtained from the cancer center and research institute. the remaining probesets, 21,097 for MOE430A_2 and 16,213 for HG-U133A, were selected for the BLAST procedure. the probeset to transcript matches were accepted only if more than 90% of all probes within a probeset were mapped to the transcript in the same orientation. the probeset to transcript matches were accepted if no more than one mismatch was found. protein' level synonymous probesets reflects the probeset-protein association transformed from a recent alternative annotation of the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array. the downloaded annotation file mapped 33,579 probesets to 287,791 GenBank mRNA accessions, among which 21,669 were found on HG-U133A array. the probeset-mRNA associations related to HG-U133A array were further linked to IPI IDs. the maximum did not result in any difference, and the average aggregation was not as sensitive as the minimum in terms of differentiating the two groups. the mean of expression coherences of all synonymous groups over a dataset was calculated. the group-level averaging was devised to mimic the counterpart operation in PPI PCC or GGI PCC calculation. the group-level averaging was devised to mimic the counterpart operation in PPI PCC or GGI PCC calculation. for human, there are totally 201,206 sequences, with 41,128 from DDBJ, 62,701 from EMBL and 97,377 from GenBank. 'gene2accession' (updated on 2006-03-28), downloaded from Entrez Gene [54] provides the mapping relationship between the CoreNucleotide sequences, Entrez Gene IDs, and protein sequence accessions. all 31 GDS datasets profiled with MOE430A_2 were used in the analyses except for GDS1057, which contains only two samples. Array HG-U133A was associated with 8,698 samples in GEO, ranking the first among all registered Affymetrix human arrays. we filtered out 3.2% and 5.2% of non-control probesets in MOE430A_2 and HG-U133A. the remaining probesets, 21,097 for MOE430A_2 and 16,213 for HG-U133A, were selected for the BLAST procedure. probeset to transcript matches were accepted if no more than one mismatch was found. one probeset maps to two or more IPI IDs. only the one-to-one probesets were used in the subsequent analyses. probesets corresponding to a single protein according to gene ID (gene-level) Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) were calculated for the expression profiles of each probeset pair. the minimum value of these PCCs was taken as a measurement of the expression coherence of this group. the minimum value of these PCCs was taken as a measure of the expression coherence of this group. the distributions of the PPI PCCs and the GGI PCCs were plotted in a same figure to show the contrast. a background distribution of the PCCs of random probeset pairs was overlaid on the same figure. we repeated the process of calculating random PCC distribution 20 times. expression consistency within synonymous probeset groups for 30 (assayed with MOE430A_2) and 28 (assayed with HG-U133A array) GEO datasets, with synonymity defined at different levels: gene level, Affy-protein level, and our protein level. additional file 3 Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) calculated on dataset GDS987.
