{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Tuberculosis (TB) has variable presentations ranging from classic presentation of respiratory symptoms to less common presentations. hematological manifestations of TB vary from common presentations such as anemia and pancytopenia to rare presentations such as immune thrombocytopenia. multiple nontender, nonpalpable purpuric lesions were observed on the lower limbs. his initial investigations revealed severe thrombocytopenia up to 7.0 109/L. he was initially diagnosed as ITP to rule out thrombocytopenia secondary to viral infection. the patient was started on pulse steroid therapy in the form of methylprednisolone 1 g intravenously daily for 3 days followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg PO once daily for 2 days. he received a total of 14 units of platelets in the first 3 days. the computed tomography scan showed diffuse lymph node enlargements of different sizes. the patient was admitted to the isolation unit as a case of community-acquired pneumonia. he was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin and oseltamivir. the screening of H1N1 and corona virus were negative. the patient's condition continued to deteriorate with a repeat ABG showing a pH 7.38, PCO2 20 mmHg, PO2 57 mmHg, HCO3 11.9 mmol/L, oxygen saturation 90% on face mask 7\u201310 L/min. he was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy by the nephrology team for acute kidney injury. the most common site for extrapulmonary TB in Saudi Arabia is lymph nodes. TB-induced immune thrombocytopenia, as was the case, is rare. the absence of granuloma in the bone marrow biopsy also delayed the diagnosis of TB. the initial response to IVIG and steroids in this patient supports the immune bases of TB-induced thrombocytopenia. the mechanism of TB-related ITP remains unclear. pulmonary TB constituted 31% of all ITP cases, TB lymphadenitis 31% and miliary TB 27%. the primary treatment is anti-TB medications in addition to IVIG. the primary treatment is anti-TB medications in addition to IVIG. authors recommend that clinicians consider TB as a possible secondary etiology of ITP. it is important to recognize TB as a treatable cause of immune thrombocytopenia and to initiate anti-TB medications early to avoid a fatal."}
