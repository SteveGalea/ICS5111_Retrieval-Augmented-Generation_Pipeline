{"summary": "parainfluenza viruses (PIV) have been shown to contribute substantially to pediatric hospitalizations in the united states. there has been no systematic surveillance to estimate the burden among pediatric outpatients. surveillance was conducted year-round, with surveillance years defined from August to July. participants recruited 5 small to moderate sized outpatient healthcare providers to report weekly age-specific counts of ILI and all-cause patient visits. data analysis analysis was limited to children aged 18 years who met the ILI case definition. parainfluenza virus 4 detections were insufficient for analyses beyond overall proportions. a season was defined as the first of 3 consecutive weeks with 2% contribution. patients with ARI were defined as having at least 2 respiratory symptoms. these patients included fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. sites followed the same methodology as previously described for ILI surveillance. nasal, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal were collected from the first 10 ILI patients each week. the sampling of up to 10 ILI patients each week ensured a large proportion of all ILI patients would be sampled. the proportion of ILI patients who tested positive for each PIV type each week, or the weekly percent positive, was multiplied by the weekly count of ILI patients to extrapolate the number of PIV-associated ILI visits. incidence estimates were then calculated per 100,000 children, using the weekly population size as the denominator. 114 HCPs participated in IISP from august 2010 to July 2014. participants were primary care clinics (90%), urgent care (9%) and student health (1%) facilities. distribution of ages in the surveillance population was similar to the US population. parainfluenza virus co-detections were identified in 5 children (0.8%), including 1 PIV1/PIV2, 1 PIV3/PIV4, 1 PIV2/PIV3 and 2 PIV1/PIV3. 63% of ILI patients negative for PIV 1\u20133 tested positive for at least one respiratory virus. seasonal circulation of PIV 1\u20133 detections across 12 months, by surveillance year, August 2010 through July 2014. prevalence of parainfluenza virus-associated ILI visits varied significantly by surveillance year and age group. parainfluenza virus 3 affected significantly younger children than PIV1 or PIV2. PIV2 affected older children than other PIV types. burden of PIV3 tended to be highest among children aged 1 to 2 years in all years. PIV2 was detected more frequently among children with sore throat (71%) than were PIV1 (55%) or PIV3 (35%; P 0.05). children with ILI and PIV3 were 1.7 times as likely to report rhinorrhea compared with those with PIV1 or PIV2 (95% CI: 1.4\u20132.0). PIV1 and PIV2 were most frequently detected in the fall and winter. the PIV1 season generally lasted from October to January, with onset occurring between August 28 and October 29. the PIV2 season began between 16 September and 23 October, but demonstrated a wide offset range between November 27 and March 13. seasonal circulation of PIV 1\u20133 detections across 12 months, by surveillance year, August 2010 through July 2014. prevalence of parainfluenza virus-associated ILI visits varied significantly by surveillance year and age group. the burden of PIV3 tended to be highest among children aged 1 to 2 years in all years (range by season 222\u2013868 per 100,000 children) During biennial years of elevated circulation, the incidence of PIV1-associated and PIV2-associated visits was greatest in children aged 2 to 4 years. children with ILI and PIV3 were 1.7 times as likely to report rhinorrhea compared with those with PIV1 or PIV2 (95% CI: 1.4\u20132.0). DISCUSSION PIVs represented a substantial burden of respiratory illnesses among children in IISP. PIVs contribute substantially to the burden of medically attended ILI in children, accounting for 9% of pediatric outpatient visits and 12% among children aged 5 years. corresponding cumulative incidence estimates from IISP suggest that PIVs are detected among pediatric outpatients aged 5 years at a rate of 259\u20131307 visits per 100,000 children. tection may be attributable to immature immune systems and prolonged viral shedding in the very young. however, whether co-detections lead to increased severity among outpatients is unclear. the difference in fever presentation across PIV studies may be attributable to differences in study populations. syncytial virus in hospitalizations because of respiratory tract infections among children aged 5 years.2,3,6,16,25 Here we use population-based surveillance data to calculate the incidence of ILI visits."}
