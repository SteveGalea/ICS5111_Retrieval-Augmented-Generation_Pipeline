{"summary": "microRNAs are a group of small noncoding RNAs about 22 nt in length that down-regulate gene expression by either of the two posttranscriptional mechanisms. miRNAs have been implicated in a vast array of cellular processes including cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. links between miRNAs and human diseases have also been established [3] Vaccinia virus (VV), a member of the Poxviridae family, is an enveloped DNA virus with a genome of 192 kb encoding about 200 proteins [19]. Various cell lines can be infected by VV, including HeLa, CV-1, mouse L, and chicken CEF cells. cytopathic effects are observed several hours after infection. after PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (KpnI/ApaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (linearized by KpnI/ApaI). to construct I7L gene with mutation in amino acid 328 from Cys to Ala, additional primers (5\u2019-GAAGCCGGGATTTTTTTTG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CCCGGCTTCAGATTCC Vaccinia virus WR strain was used to infect HeLa and HuH 7 cells. vI7Li was added to the cells at a concentration of 40 g/ml. real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Total RNAs extracted from HeLa or HuH7 cells were converted into cDNAs using oligo-dT as the primer. primers (5\u2019 TGGAGACGCCAATAGCAATA 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 TGCTGCTGGAATTCTT 3\u2019) were used to detect TFRC mRNA as a control. DNA fragment for I7L gene coding region, vaccinia genomic DNA [22] was used as template and forward and reverse PCR primers (5\u2019-CGGGGTACCATGGAAAGATATACAGATTTAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-ATCGATGGGCCCTTTTTTACTATTC-3\u2019) after PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (KpnI/ApaI). the gene fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (linearized by EcoRI/XbaI) all of the expression plasmids were verified by sequencing. Vaccinia virus WR strain was used to infect HeLa and HuH 7 cells. 800 ug protein is needed to detect the endogenous Dicer protein. antibody was used to detect exogenous T7-Dicer protein from expressing plasmid. oligo-dT primers were used to detect mRNA122 and U6. Dicer mRNA level was not specifically reduced after VV infection. exogenously expressed Dicer protein with a T7 tag at its N-terminus was also reduced after VV but not influenza A virus infection. HuH7 cells were either mock transfected (lane 1) or infected with VV. MG132 (lane 7) or araC (lane 8) were also added in the culture. similar results were found in HCV replicon cells derived from HuH7 cells with HCV subgenomic RNAs. Cleavage of Dicer protein by I7 protease facilitates Dicer degradation. it is possible that during VV infection Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease. a band with smaller size was detected in the presence of MG132. expression of I7 protease could only be detected by Western blotting. plasmid expressing mutant I7 protease lack of protease activity. cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. cells were transfected with empty vector (Vec), plasmids expressing I7 protease (I7) or I7 protease containing C328A mutation (I7m) twenty-four hrs after treatment, cell lysates were analyzed with antibodies against the T7 tag. cell lysates were analyzed with antibodies against the N-terminal T7 tag of Dicer protein (upper panel), NPT protein as the transfection control or Erk2 protein as the loading control. it is possible that Dicer protein was cleaved by I7 protease after a.a. 1817. a plasmid expressing the protein with mutation in a.a. 1816 and 1817 was constructed. inhibition of miR122 processing either by vaccinia virus infection or by protease expression. degradation of Dicer protein should block formation of miRNAs. miRNA repertoires are highly cell type specific and change markedly during development or upon cell activation. twenty-four hrs after transfection, the cells with pre-miR122 were mock-infected or infected with VV in different M.O.I. (1, 5, and 10) real-time PCR assay was performed to detect miR122 using U6 mRNA as the internal control for normalization. degradation of miRNA122 would reduce the production of miRNA122. replication of HCV subgenomic RNA should be reduced in HCV replicon cells after VV infection. cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against Dicer protein, NS5A protein for the expression of HCV subgenomic RNAs. the thin arrow marks the position of NPT protein expressed from the transfected plasmids while the thick arrow marks the position of core-NPT fusion protein encoding from HCV subgenomic RNAs. HeLa cells were transfected with empty vector (2 ug, lanes 1 and 2). cells were mock-infected (lanes 1, 3 and 5) or infected with VV (M.O.I. = 10). cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. the amount of endogenous Dicer protein was reduced after VV infection in HeLa cells as detected by antibodies against its extreme C-terminus. this reduction could be recovered after AraC, an inhibitor of VV DNA replication, was added after virus infection (lane 3, Fig. 1A) cells were either mock transfected (lane 2) or infected with VV (M.O.I. = 3, lanes 3\u20135). after the time indicated, cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. MG132 (lane 7) or araC (lane 8) was also added in the culture. the amount of endogenous Dicer protein was also reduced after VV infection in HuH7 cells. similar results were found in HCV replicon cells with HCV subgenomic RNAs. the same samples were analyzed using antibodies against the extreme C-terminus of Dicer protein. expression of I7 protease could only be detected by Western blotting. expression of I7 protease could only be detected by Western blotting. cells were mock-transfected (lane 4), co-transfected with plasmids expressing T7-Dicer and empty vector (lane 1) or the plasmids expressing T7-Dicer and I7 protease (lanes 2 and 3) thirty-two hrs after transfection, 10 uM MG132 was also added (lane 3). cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against the T7 twenty-four hrs after transfection, cells were either mock infected (lanes 2 and 5), or infected with VV (M.O.I. = 5) in the presence (lanes 4 and 7) or absence (lanes 3 and 6) of 100 ug araC. cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HeLa cells were mock-infected, infected with wild-type vaccinia virus (WT) or recombinant virus vI7Li (M.O.I. = 5). cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. inhibition of miR122 processing either by vaccinia virus infection or by I7 protease expression. say was performed to detect the amount of miR122 using U6 mRNA as the internal control for normalization. twenty-four hrs after transfection, the cells with pre-miR122 were mock-transfected or infected with VV. the exogenous pre-miR122 level was also increased in the presence of I7 protease in a dose dependent manner. the Dicer mRNA level was not affected by I7 protease. it has been previously reported that miRNA122 could facilitate HCV replication. replicon cells were mock-transfected or transfected with the indicated amount of the plasmid expressing I7 protease (lanes 1\u20136) the indicated amount of the plasmid expressing I7 protease was also added. the plasmid expressing I7 protease was also transfected into the replicon cells. the number of secreted viral particles was reduced when the Dicer protein with mutations in a.a. 1816 and 1817 was exogenously expressed. on the other hand, knockdown of Dicer protein expression using siRNA technology did not increase the number of secreted viral particles significantly. a recent report indicated that Dicer protein was suppressed in VV-infected cells that was associated with a universal reduction of host miRNAs expression. reduction of Dicer protein during VV infection is probably one of the many factors responsible for the viral pathogenesis. I7 protease derived from expressing plasmid is much more labile. it could only be detected by Western blotting analysis in the presence of MG132. however, tiny amount of I7 protease should be sufficient for the cleavage of Dicer protein. RNAi could serve as an innate antiviral mechanism in plants, fungi and animals. human viruses encode suppressor proteins or RNAs that block or modulate the RNAi pathway."}
