{"summary": "retrospective case\u2013control study of children who had received medical care for any illness necessitating collection of nasopharyngeal specimens. children 21 years of age had acute neurologic illness characterized by focal weakness of >1 limbs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of spinal cord lesions largely restricted to gray matter, and no identified etiology. Specimens submitted for RPP and BP testing from the same child were considered for the RPP analysis only. we also analyzed results of FilmArray testing for all patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at CHCO during July\u2013November 2014. all specimens positive by pan-enterovirus RT-rPCR that were not EV-D68 were also molecularly sequenced for virus identification. samples from PICU patients were tested first with the filmArray panel at CHCO. positive samples were sent to CDC, where they underwent the same series of testing as controls. nasopharyngeal swab samples were similar, more pathogens might be identified in nasopharyngeal swab samples (17). Statistical analyses reported characteristics of the AFM case-patients and control children. all analyses were performed with SAS statistical software package version 9.3. children who had received medical care for any illness necessitating collection of nasopharyngeal specimens for respiratory pathogen testing in Colorado during august 3, 2014\u2013October 18, 2014. syncytial viruses A and B; enterovirus/rhinovirus; Bordetella pertussis; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. children who were evaluated as outpatients and who had nasopharyngeal specimens obtained for PCR testing for B. pertussis. filmArray testing was first conducted for the RPP- and BP-tested controls. all specimens positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus were sent to CDC. rRT-PCR assay performed similar to VP1 seminested PCR assay. nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasopharyngeal swab samples are similar. more pathogens might be identified in nasopharyngeal swab samples. medians and interquartile ranges were provided for age and days between symptom onset and collection. model 1 tested the association between EV-D68 and AFM. model 2 tested the association between enterovirus/rhinovirus excluding EV-D68 and AFM. the CDC AFM case definition resulted in exclusion of 2 patients with acute neurologic disease with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction, or both. all patients with acute flaccid myelitis had an antecedent acute illness; most (91%) reported respiratory illness. 0.69 221 (97) 0.25 Fever, no.

EV-D68 association with acute flaccid myelitis compared with BP-tested controls, Colorado, USA, 2014*. BP, Bordetella pertussis; EV, enterovirus; NA, not applicable; OR, odds ratio; RPP, respiratory pathogen panel; RV, rhinovirus. nasopharyngeal specimen was collected from only 1 of these 2 patients. results did not differ appreciably from those of the main analysis. EV-D68 association with acute neurologic disease compared with that of RPP-tested controls. al specimen was collected from only 1 of these 2 patients. EV-D68 association with acute neurologic disease compared with that of RPP-tested and BP-tested controls. RPP-tested controls were younger, reflecting the median 5 years of age reported during the 2014 EV-D68 respiratory outbreak (18). the older age of the AFM case-patients was similar to the median 7.6 years reported in the US description of AFM cases (10). however, data from Europe and Wales describe similar disease in younger children. the prevalence of EV-D68 among the controls was much lower than that seen among PICU patients. the official CHCO respiratory illness algorithm discouraged clinicians from testing all children with respiratory symptoms seen in emergency or outpatient settings for EV-D68. children with routine respiratory symptoms seen in emergency or outpatient settings were not being sampled for EV-D68. poliovirus and EV-A71 show tropism for the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. EV-A71 was initially linked to nonneurologic syndromes, specifically herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease. outbreak data concludesively revealed an association between EV-A71 and neurologic syndromes. respiratory specimens were obtained after a much shorter interval from patients in the RPP-control group than from patients in the AFM case-patient and BP-control groups. this delay might have led to a lower prevalence of EV-D68 in these latter 2 groups than would have been found if testing had been performed sooner (28). nasopharyngeal specimens are not sterile; presence of viruses in these samples might be coincidental and not causative of AFM. a gap remains between the epidemiologic data and the data from extensive testing of laboratory specimens. CDC recommends continued surveillance, and a revised case definition without age restrictions has been implemented."}
