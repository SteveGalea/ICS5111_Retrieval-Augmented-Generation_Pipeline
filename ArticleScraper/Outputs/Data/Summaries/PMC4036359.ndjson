{"summary": "PTX3 is a 45-kDa glycoprotein that can form an octameric structure, i.e. a complex quaternary structure with eight protomer subunits held together by both covalent (disulfide) and non-covalent interactions. PTX3 shares with short pentraxins a C-terminal pentraxin-like domain that can bind with ligands, such as complement component C1q, microbial HC-HA complex is a covalent complex formed by high molecular weight HA and HCs via an ester bond by a catalytic action of TSG-6 (16\u201318) infertility ensues in female ptx3-deficient mice because of the lack of PTX3 that is important to stabilize HC-HA in the COC matrix. from the human amniotic membrane (AM), we have isolated and characterized a HC-HA complex that exerts 3-(N,N-dimethyl palmitylammonio) propanesulfonate (Zwittergent3\u201316), protease inhibitor mixture (including 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, bestatin hydrochloride, E-64, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis recombinant human TNF, recombinant human Pentraxin 3/TSG-14, recombinant human TSG-6, and human/mouse TSG-6 mAb (catalog no.

(Waltham, MA) the RNeasy mini kit was from Qiagen. ELISA kits for murine IL-10 and IL-12p40 were from Biolegend. the culture medium was changed every 2 days. cells at 80% confluence were switched to DMEM/F12 containing 0.5% FBS for 48 h before being treated with 20 ng/ml of TNF or IL-1 for 4 or 24 h.

HA was initially covalently cross-linked to Covalink-NH 96-well plates (2 g/well) at 4 \u00b0C for 16 h, and the unbound HA was removed by washing with PBS containing 2 m NaCl and 50 mm MgSO4 followed by PBS. the wells were then washed three times with PBST and then three times with 6 m GnHCl. incubation with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA substrate solution and stop solution was read with 650 nm as a reference. cDNA was reverse-transcribed using a high-capacity reverse transcription kit and amplified by quantitative PCR. positive PTX3 staining was not only found in the apical surface of the epithelium, but also in the compact stroma. in contrast, PTX3 staining was markedly attenuated in the spongy stroma and the chorion and could not be unmasked by HAase digestion. positive HA immunostaining was specific to HA because it disappeared when the tissue section was predigested by HAase ouse, or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (green) or probed with biotinylated HABP with or without HAase digestion. non-immune rat or mouse serum was used as a control. the HMW PTX3-containing species in the loading well was likely associated with the HC-HA complex because NaOH cleaves off the ester covalent linkage between HC and HA in the HC-HA complex. to further confirm this notion, we purified the HC-HA complex by two and four successive runs of ultracentrifugation from the AM soluble extract. a 90-kDa PTX3 dimer was noted in AM second and fourth HC-HA PTX3 smear was not an artifact because of reoligomerization. recombinant human PTX3 control, purified human II control, AM extract and the AM HC-HA complex were treated with or without 50 mm NaOH at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h or HAase at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the immunoblot was first probed with rat anti-PTX3 antibody (A) and then stripped and repro HC-HA complex displayed as an HMW species at the bottom of the loading well. HC1 was released from the HC-HA complex after HAase digestion. a free 80-kDa HC1 band was detected only in the second HC-HA complex. the presence of HA in the fourth HC-HA complex was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. quantitative PCR showed that the expression of the PTX3 transcript was low in resting HSF but up-regulated by TNF and IL-1 4.1-fold and 2.0-fold respectively. the 45-kDa PTX3 protein band was detected in a small amount in lysates but undetectable in the medium of resting HSF by Western blot analysis. synthesis and secretion of PTX3 was further up-regulated by proinflammatory stimuli in resting AM cells but not HSF. total RNAs and proteins were extracted from HSF, AMEC, and AMSC cultures. expression of PTX3 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the endogenous control. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions in all three cultures. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions. agarose overlay reduces HA release into the medium. A, the HA concentration measured by ELISA assay was reduced. phase-contrast micrographs of HSF, AMSC, and AMEC cultured in both serum-free and FBS-containing conditions with or without agarose overlay. positive HC1 or HC2 staining was noted in AMSC and AMEC cultures. HC1 and HC2 staining was found in AMSC and AMEC even in the absence of FBS and TNF treatment. these results support the notion that extracellular HA-rich matrix was trapped by the agarose overlay in these cell cultures. kDa dimer, 45-kDa monomer, was readily detected in AMSC. results confirm that AMSC produced the HC-HA-PTX3 complex by constitutive production of PTX3. smear was generated by exogenous PTX3 in resting HSF without TNF. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were subjected to Western blot analysis for PTX3 with or without NaOH treatment. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were first immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human II polyclonal antibody (top panel), stripped, and reprobed with rat anti-human PTX3 monoclonal antibody (bottom panel) HAase digestion resulted in an increase of the 80-kDa HCs species and the HMW smear but not the 35-kDa species. the diffuse species at about 50 kDa corresponded to the heavy chains of rabbit IgG linked to Sepharose beads. after stripping, the same blot reprobed with the anti-PTX3 antibody showed a 45-kDa species, a 90-kDa species, and an H ELISAs confirmed no transfer of HCs from purified II to immobilized HA in the absence of TSG-6. without immobilized HA, no HC1 or HC2 was detected, even when II, TSG-6, and PTX3 were incubated in the wells. the amount of TSG-6 bound to immobilized HA greatly decreased when II was added together with TSG-6 to the immobilized HA compared with adding only TSG-6 to immobilized HA. PTX3 was detected dose-dependently when PTX3 was incubated along with II and TSG-6 with immobilized HA. AM HC-HA-PTX3 was up-regulated by rcHC-HA (p 0.01) but down-regulated by rcHC-HA-PTX3 and AM HC-HA-PTX3 (all p 0.01). the presence of PTX3 in the rcHC-HA complex contributes to the polarization of M2 macrophages, similar to what has been reported for AM HC-HA-PTX3 (24). HC2 (B), TSG-6 (C), and PTX3 (D) to immobilized HA respectively. results represent mean S.D. (n = 4) positive PTX3 staining was not only found in the apical surface of the epithelium, but also in the compact stroma. PTX3 staining was markedly attenuated in the spongy stroma and the chorion. HA staining was specific to HA because it disappeared when the tissue section was predigested by HAase. soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) and a minor 180-kDa species, resulting in an HMW smear of PTX3. the HMW PTX3-containing species in the loading well was likely associated with the HC-HA complex because NaOH cleaves off the ester covalent linkage between HC and HA in the HC-HA complex. to further confirm this notion, we purified the HC-HA complex by two and four successive runs of ultracentrifugation from the AM soluble extract. a 90-kDa PTX3 dimer was noted in AM second and fourth HC-HA PTX3 smear was not an artifact because of reoligomerization. recombinant human PTX3 control, purified human II control, AM extract and the AM HC-HA complex were treated with or without 50 mm NaOH at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h or HAase at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the control of PTX3 and the control of II were mixed just before loading to the same well of the gel the purified HC-HA complex displayed as an HMW species at the bottom of the loading well and disappeared upon HAase digestion. HC1 was released from the HC-HA complex after HAase digestion. a free 80-kDa HC1 band was detected only in the second HC-HA complex, but not in the fourth HC-HA complex. the 45-kDa PTX3 protein band was detected in a small amount in lysates. but the amount of PTX3 protein was undetectable in the medium of resting HSF. PTX3 protein was readily detectable in both lysates (45 kDa) and medium (45 kDa and 90 kDa) in resting AMEC. PTX3 was further up-regulated by proinflammatory stimuli in resting AM cells. total RNAs and proteins were extracted from HSF, AMEC, and AMSC cultured in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS for 48 h. expression of PTX3 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with GAPDH. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions in all three cultures. phase-contrast micrographs of HSF, AMSC, and AMEC cultured in both serum-free and FBS-containing conditions with or without agarose overlay for 5 days. scale bar = 50 m. we then performed double immunostaining for PTX3-HA, HC1-HA, and HC2-HA using biotin-labeled HABP, specific antibodies to HC1 and HC2 and anti-PTX3 antibody. positive staining for HC1 and HC2 was found in AMSC and AMEC. this was even in the absence of FBS and TNF treatment. these results support the notion that extracellular HA-rich matrix was trapped by the agarose overlay in these cell cultures. the HC-HA-PTX3 complex was formed by AMSC with endogenous PTX3 and by HSF with exogenous PTX3. this result resembles what was shown in AMSC (Fig. 6A, lane 5), suggesting that extracellular PTX3 was responsible for the formation of the HC-HA-PTX3 complex. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were first immunoprecipitated (IP) with rabbit anti-human II polyclonal antibody or control rabbit IgG. anti-II antibody revealed a major species of 80 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of free HCs. HAase digestion resulted in an increase of the 80-kDa HCs species and the HMW smear but not the 35-kDa species. the diffuse species at about 50 kDa corresponded to the heavy chains of rabbit IgG linked to Sepharose beads. after stripping, the same blot reprobed with the anti-PTX3 antibody showed a 45-kDa species, a 90-kDa species, and an H ELISAs confirmed no transfer of HCs from purified II to immobilized HA in the absence of TSG-6. without immobilized HA, no HC1 or HC2 was detected, even when II, TSG-6, and PTX3 were incubated in the wells. no binding of PTX3 to immobilized HA when PTX3 alone was incubated. PTX3 was detected dose-dependently when PTX3 was incubated. rcHC-HA and rcHC-HA-PTX3 complexes measured expression of IL-12 and IL-10 proteins as markers for the phenotypes. rcHC-HA-PTX3 and AM HC-HA-PTX3 down-regulated by rcHC-HA-PTX3 and rcHC-HA-PTX3. results suggest presence of PTX3 in rcHC-HA complex contributes to polarization of M2 macrophages. p 0.05 for II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (200 nm) versus II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (20 nm); ##, p 0.05 for II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (100 or 200 nm) versus II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (20 nm); ##, p 0.05 for II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (100 or 200 nm) versus II + TSG positive HA immunostaining was more intense in the AM stroma than in the AM epithelium and the chorion. such positive HA staining was specific to HA because it disappeared when the tissue section was predigested by HAase. these results suggest the predominant presence of PTX3 in the AM compact stroma and epithelium. soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) and a minor 180-kDa species (Fig. 2A, lane 3). in the loading well was likely associated with the HC-HA complex. we purified the HC-HA complex by two and four successive runs of ultracentrifugation from the AM soluble extract. a 90-kDa PTX3 dimer was noted in AM second and fourth HC-HA complex besides an HMW band at the bottom of the loading well. after HAase treatment, the 90-kDa dimer appeared in both HC-HA complexes PTX3 in the HC-HA complex was not an artifact because of reoligomerization. recombinant human PTX3 control, purified human II control, AM extract and the AM HC-HA complex were treated with or without 50 mm NaOH at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h or HAase at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the control of PTX3 and the control of II were mixed just before loading to the same well of purified HC-HA complex displayed as an HMW species at the bottom of the loading well and disappeared upon HAase digestion. HC1 was released from the HC-HA complex after HAase digestion. a free 80-kDa HC1 band was detected only in the second HC-HA complex, but not in the fourth HC-HA complex. the 45-kDa PTX3 protein band was detected in a small amount in lysates. however, the amount of PTX3 protein was increased only slightly in lysates. PTX3 protein was readily detectable in both lysates and medium (45 kDa and 90 kDa) in resting AMEC. total RNAs and proteins were extracted from HSF, AMEC, and AMSC cultured in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS for 48 h. expression of PTX3 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the endogenous control. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions in all three cultures. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both serum-free and FBS-containing conditions. phase-contrast micrographs of HSF, AMSC, and AMEC cultured in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions with or without agarose overlay for 5 days. scale bar = 50 m. we then performed double immunostaining for PTX3-HA, HC1-HA, and HC2-HA using biotin-labeled HABP, specific antibodies to HC1 and HC2 and anti-PTX3 antibody. hyaluronan (red), PTX3 (green), HC1 (green) and HC2 (green) were cultured with an agarose overlay for 5 days. cells were probed for hyaluronan (red), PTX3 (green), HC1 (green) and HC2 (green) HC-HA-PTX3 complex formed by AMSC with endogenous PTX3 and by HSF with exogenous PTX3. results confirm that AMSC produced the HC-HA-PTX3 complex by constitutive production of PTX3. recombinant human PTX3 was produced by constitutive production of PTX3. exogenous PTX3 helped HSF form an HMW PTX3 smear in the presence of FBS without TNF. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were first immunoprecipitated (IP) with rabbit anti-human II polyclonal antibody (bottom panel), stripped, and reprobed with rat anti-human PTX3 monoclonal antibody (bottom panel) HAase digestion increased the 45-kDa and 90-kDa species. the HC-HA complex exerts anti-inflammatory, antiscarring (21) and antiangiogenic (22) actions of the AM and can polarize macrophages to an M2 phenotype upon Toll-like receptor ligation. ELISAs confirmed no transfer of HCs from purified II to immobilized HA in the absence of TSG-6. both HC1 and HC2 were bound to immobilized HA when II was incubated with TSG-6. without immobilized HA, no HC1 or HC2 was detected. PTX3 did not directly bind to immobilized HA when HA coated the plate surface non-covalently (15) PTX3 was detected dose-dependently when PTX3 was incubated along with II and TSG-6 with immobilized HA from 20\u2013200 nm (all p 0.05). rcHC-HA and rcHC-HA-PTX3 complexes measured expression of IL-12 and IL-10 proteins as markers for the M1 and rcHC-HA-PTX3 was more effective by AM HC-HA-PTX3 than by rcHC-HA-PTX3 formed by different PTX3 concentrations (p 0.01). these results suggest that the presence of PTX3 in the rcHC-HA complex contributes to the polarization of M2 macrophages. p 0.05 for II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (100 or 200 nm) versus II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (20 nm); ##, p 0.05 for II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (100 or 200 nm) versus II + TSG-6 + PTX3 (100 nm) positive HA immunostaining was more intense in the AM stroma than in the AM epithelium and the chorion. such positive HA staining was specific to HA because it disappeared when the tissue section was predigested by HAase. these results suggest the predominant presence of PTX3 in the AM compact stroma and epithelium. soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a HMW species at the bottom of the loading well (mostly not entering the gel) soluble AM extract revealed 45-kDa, a 90-kDa, and a minor 90-kDa species corresponding to the soluble AM extract purified the HC-HA complex by two and four successive runs of ultracentrifugation from the AM soluble extract. a 90-kDa PTX3 dimer was noted in AM second and fourth HC-HA complex besides an HMW band at the bottom of the loading well. after HAase treatment, the 90-kDa dimer appeared in both HC-HA and fourth HC-HA complexes. recombinant human PTX3 control, purified human II control, AM extract and the AM HC-HA complex were treated with or without 50 mm NaOH at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h or HAase at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the control of PTX3 and the control of II (after NaOH treatment) were mixed just before loading to the same well of the gel. the immunoblot was first probed with rat anti-PTX3 antibody HC1 was released from the HC-HA complex after HAase digestion. the presence of HA in the fourth HC-HA complex was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis as a continuous HA smear from the top loading well to the bottom of the gel that disappeared after HAase digestion. the 45-kDa PTX3 protein band was detected in a small amount in lysates. but the amount of PTX3 protein was increased only slightly in lysates. PTX3 protein was readily detectable in both lysates (45 kDa) and medium (45 kDa and 90 kDa) in resting AMEC. PTX3 siRNA transfection was performed in AMEC and AMSC with or without 20 ng/ml of TNF after being cultured in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS for 48 h. the expression of PTX3 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the endogenous control. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both FBS-free and FBS-containing conditions in all three cultures. agarose overlay reduced the HA level in the medium more than 50% in both serum-free and FBS-containing conditions. free and FBS-containing conditions with or without agarose overlay for 5 days. we then performed double immunostaining for PTX3-HA, HC1-HA, and HC2-HA. we then performed double immunostaining for PTX3-HA, HC1-HA, and HC2-HA. immunolocalization of HA, PTX3, HC1 and HC2 in cells cultured under agarose overlay for 5 days. cells were probed for hyaluronan (red), PTX3 (green), HC1 (green) and HC2 (green) nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) the HC-HA-PTX3 complex formed by AMSC with endogenous PTX3 and by HSF with exogenous PTX3 smear. exogenous recombinant human PTX3 smear was generated by exogenous PTX3 in resting HSF without TNF. this result resembles what was shown in AMSC. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were cultured under an agarose overlay in FBS-containing medium with 100 nm human recombinant PTX3 or 5 ng/ml TNF for 5 days. then the extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis for PTX3. agarose-overlaid AMSC culture extracts with or without HAase digestion were first immunoprecipitate blot reprobed with anti-PTX3 antibody showed a 45-kDa species, a 90-kDa species, and an HMW species in the loading well. HAase digestion increased the 45-kDa and 90-kDa species, suggesting that PTX3 was coimmunoprecipitated with HC-HA by anti-II antibody. ELISAs confirmed no transfer of HCs from purified II to immobilized HA. HC1 and HC2 were bound to immobilized HA when II was incubated. without immobilized HA, no HC1 or HC2 was detected, even when II, TSG-6, and PTX3 were incubated. PTX3 did not directly bind to immobilized HA when HA coated the plate surface non-covalently (15) PTX3 was detected dose-dependently when PTX3 was incubated along with II and TSG-6 with immobilized HA from 20\u2013200 nm (all p 0.05) the results suggest that PTX3 was bound to rcHC-HA and formed the rcHC-HA-PTX3 complex, presumably by interacting with the presence of PTX3 in the rcHC-HA complex contributes to the polarization of M2 macrophages. this is similar to what has been reported for AM HC-HA-PTX3 (24) rcHC-HA and rcHC-HA-PTX3 complexes were seeded on the aforementioned complexes. the protein levels of IL-10 (E) and IL-12p40 (F) were measured in conditioned medium by ELISA. a Western blot analysis showed that PTX3 was readily detected and tightly bound to the AM HC-HA complex. the binding of PTX3 to AM HC-HA complex was strong to withstand four runs of ultracentrifugation in the presence of CsCl and 4 m GnHCl. a low level of PTX3 mRNA and production of PTX3 protein were detected intracellularly, despite treatment with or without FBS in HSF. previous studies have shown constitutive expression of PTX3 protein by human neutrophils (49), renal mesangial cells, and proximal tubular epithelial cells (50) cultured AM cells produce the HC-HA complex in the cell layer using their endogenously generated II (23). this notion was further substantiated by the production of an HMW PTX3 smear. the presence of recombinant PTX3 in the AM HC-HA-PTX3 complex is responsible for the biological function of the complex. edward et al."}
