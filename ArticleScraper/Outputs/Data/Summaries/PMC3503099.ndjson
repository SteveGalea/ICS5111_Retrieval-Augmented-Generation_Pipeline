{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus known to infect fowls, including turkey and pheasant (2, 3, 11) different serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been reported and identified to be generated by RNA recombination, insertions, and point mutations due to replication and evolution. sequence of GX-NN09032 (located at nt 20374 to 22011) showed the highest nucleotide acid sequence identities (99%, 98%, and 98%) to those of Chinese strains CK/CH/SD09/005 (GenBank accession no. HM230749.1), TC07-2 (GenBank accession no. GQ265948.1), and CK/CH/GD/KP10 (GenBank accession no. HQ the full-length genome sequence of GX-NN09032 has been deposited in NCBI GenBank under accession no. JX897900. Nucleotide sequence accession number."}
