{"summary": "questionnaire was adapted from the world health organisation\u2019s survey. results Nurses showed scores on knowledge (17.62.5), perception (69.30.8), self-reported HH performance of non-self (86.011.0), self-reported performance of self (88.211.0), and attitude (50.55.5) HH performance rate of non-self was Y1=36.678+ 0.555X1 (HH performance rate of self) the reported rates of HH performance among HCWs are low, ranging from 18.3 to 68.0%, which is insufficient to satisfactorily prevent HAIs. the study was conducted to assess the status of knowledge, perceptions, and performance of nurses in community-based hospitals in a small-to-medium-sized city. the enrolment criteria were hospitals affiliated with teaching hospitals. 5 community-based hospitals affiliated with teaching hospitals were enrolled in this study. subjects\u2019 participation was voluntary and anonymous. perceptions domain (B) was also adapted from the WHO questionnaire. three questions (B2, B3, and B4 in Table S2) were excluded from the total score because they reduced the reliability of the questionnaire. participants' time to complete questionnaire was recorded and within-domain reliability was calculated. participants' age, sex, religion, marital status, education level, department, and position. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to identify associations among knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and self-reported HH performance of self. a sample size of 270 would be required to achieve a power of 0.80 with an effect size of 0.15 with an alpha of 0.05. a total of 300 questionnaires were distributed and 293 were returned. questionnaire included 4 domains: (A) HH knowledge, (B) HH perceptions, (C) HH attitudes and role models, and (D) participant demographics and hospital characteristics. attitudes and role models domain (C) was adapted from a previous study. a self-report questionnaire consisting of 8 items on a 1- to 7-point scale from \u2018not effective\u2019 to \u2018very effective\u2019. participants' time to complete the questionnaire was recorded and within-domain reliability was calculated. yes/no answers were coded as \u2018yes\u2019=1, \u2018no\u2019=0. data analysis data were analysed using SPSS version 24.0. the Cronbach alpha values were 0.611 (domain A, knowledge), 0.932 (domain B, perceptions), 0.774 (domain C, attitudes) and 0.900 (domain C, role models) in this study. these values were 0.381, 0.532, 0.576, and 0.932 respectively, in the pilot study. the proportion of high and medium levels of correct answers for knowledge was 17.62.5. the proportion of high and medium levels of correct answers for knowledge was 68.0% (Table 2). perceptions and performance Participants\u2019 meanSD perception score was 69.30.8. the self-reported HH performance of non-self was 86.011.0 (meanSD) 'CR1: I think that the charge nurse is performing according to the hospital\u2019s regulations' and 'CR6: I think my colleague nurses are performing HH according to the hospital\u2019s regulations' both received a score of 6.60.6. the mean knowledge scores were significantly higher among participants who had received HH education within the past year. three-year college 68.68.7 136 0.012 Bachelor\u2019s 69.37.3 128 Master\u2019s or PhD 74.63.4 19 Unspecified 72.38.1 3 Position (nurse) Staff 68.78.2 230 0.0012 Charge 70.07.1 34 Head 74.24.6 25 Self-reported HH performance of self Received education within the past year Yes 86.510.7 241 0.001 No.76.412.2 14 HH performance was monitored Yes 86.71 titudes Role models Self-reported HH performance of self Knowledge 1.000 Perceptions -0.036 1.000 Attitudes -0.075 0.422*** 1.000 Role models 0.094 0.349*** 0.368*** 1.000 Self-reported HH performance of self 0.034 0.303*** 0.281*** 0.414*** 1.000 HH, hand hygiene. -1.488 0.14 -1.296, 0.180 -0.088 1.795 Perception Intercept 61.408 31.667 0.001 57.591, 65.226 0.078 (0.001) HH performance was monitored2 2.566 (0.123) 1.791 0.07 -0.255, 5.387 0.107 1.449 Monitored colleagues\u2019 HH performance2 1.054 (0.058) 0.835 0.40 -1.431, 3.540 0.050 1.467 HH campaign2 regression model for perceptions was calculated as Y3=61.408+2.566X31 (HH performance was monitored)+ 1.054X32 (monitoring colleagues\u2019 HH performance)+1.611X33 (HH campaign)+0.850X34 (marital status)+0.978X36 (position) (49.1) Married 147 (50.8) Education level 3-Year college 136 (47.1) Unspecified 3 (1.0) Department Internal medicine 41 (14.2) Surgery 63 (21.8) Obstetrics/pediatrics 75 (26.0) Emergency 9 (3.1) Outpatient 19 (6.6) Operating room 15 (5.2) Other 39 (13.5) Position (nurse) Staff 230 (79.6) Charge 34 (11.8) Head 25 (8.6) Received HH education within last year (yes) 273 (9 the self-reported HH performance of non-self was 86.011.0 (meanSD) the self-reported HH performance of self was 88.211.0 (meanSD) this was highest after body fluid exposure/risk (96.29.6) and lowest before touching a patient (81.317.6) some questions on attitudes showed extraordinarily low meanSD scores. in particular, the scores of \u201cC7: HH is convenient\u201d and \u201cC8: HH is protective\u201d were 5.91.3, and 5.21.9 respectively. knowledge Participants\u2019 meanSD score of knowledge was 17.62.5;

HH performance being monitored (yes), monitoring colleagues\u2019 HH performance (yes), and the presence of an HH campaign (yes) positively affected perceptions. self-reported HH performance rate was associated with perceptions, attitudes, and role models. the self-reported HH performance rate of self was associated with perceptions, attitudes, and role models."}
