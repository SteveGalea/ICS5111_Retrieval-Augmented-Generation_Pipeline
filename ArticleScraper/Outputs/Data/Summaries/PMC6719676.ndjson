{"summary": "contact networks consist of individuals (nodes) with connections (edges) between them representing interactions that may lead to infection transmission. social contact networks can be used to highlight potential transmission routes 2 and identify targeted intervention strategies. questionnaire method suffers several setbacks, key being recall bias and low participation rates 6, 14, 17. the majority of studies using this platform reported a high participation rate (75%), suggesting that an unobtrusive way of data collection requiring minimal participant intervention elicits better response rates compared to paper diaries 14. a feasibility study on acceptability and utility of using sensors within five households was conducted in Kilifi over three days of the week 26. studies have revealed the role of older siblings, mothers and other household members on the transmission of respiratory infections to infants. schools and households are locations where a high proportion of a population will spend most of their time and individual interactions are frequent and intense 4, 6, 11, 13, potentially leading to a high propensity to spreading of respiratory infections 38\u2013 40. social contact networks can be used to highlight potential transmission routes 2 and identify targeted intervention strategies. the questionnaire method suffers several setbacks, key being recall bias and low participation rates 6, 14, 17. low-powered radio frequencies have been used in \u2018closed\u2019 settings such as households 26, 27, schools 28\u2013 30, hospitals 25, 31\u2013 34, work-places 24, 35 and conferences 36. sensors provide a rich temporal data source, even for partial networks, that can be used to investigate plausible characteristics of infection spread. residents aged 15 years were under-represented due to being away at school or work. current sensors being deployed in recent studies are smaller, lighter, round in shape and with an on-board flash memory. these properties have made the sensors more suitable for use in larger population-based studies. larger studies that may capture contact events within and between households are suggested to provide empirical data that is needed in mathematical models that simulate transmission. this will provide key data for use in transmission dynamic models for common respiratory viral and bacterial infections such as RSV. illance system (KHDSS) area 49, namely Matsangoni and Kilifi Township, categorized as rural and urban, respectively. all household demographic information (births, deaths, migrations) and geographic location details have been linked to clinical surveillance data at the Kilifi County Hospital thus creating the KHDSS. the first point of entry will be two primary schools as identified in Figure 1C. for each site, the maximum number of participants is expected to be 350. this number is guided by the number of sensors available for deployment. households will be recruited into the study to give an expected minimum of 396 and 324 residents in rural and urban setting. average household size is 11 and 9 in rural and urban areas. individuals within households will be eligible to participate if: (i) they are a member of a household in which the index student lives, or of a household immediately neighbouring the house of an index student. the attenuation of the signals with distance is computed as the difference between the received and transmitted power. all individuals will wear a sensor attached to a lanyard around the neck so that it rests on the chest area or pinned to the front of a blouse/shirt especially for younger children. a considerable amount of time may be spent at the school since this will be the first point of entry for the study. the headteacher in consultation with the parent-teacher association will be asked to give written consent for the school to participate in the study. the publicly available version of the SocioPatterns tag firmware is a branch of the OpenBeacon firmware. a contact event is detected if one sensor records a radio packet from another sensor. a contact event is detected if the incoming radio power is higher than a given attenuation threshold, calibrated to correspond to 1.5 metres of separation distance 26. a contact event occurs if at least one data packet is exchanged between two devices during a continuous 20-second time window. a contact is considered broken if a 20-second time window passes without data exchange. the weight n ij of an edge between nodes i and j is the number of contact events recorded between these individuals during a given time window. j ( w i j, 1 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i j, 2 ) j ( w i

respectively. all household demographic information (births, deaths, migrations) and geographic location details have been linked to clinical surveillance data at the Kilifi County Hospital thus creating the KHDSS. household residents linked to a sub-selection of participating students will be recruited. for each site, the maximum number of participants is expected to be 350. a fixed number (350) of students will be randomly selected proportional to grade and gender. three index students will be selected by simple random sampling. each of the 9 households per setting will be linked to their households. an additional 3\u20135 neighbouring households will be recruited into the study. sensors exchange a maximum of 1 data packet per second and can store over 1,000 hours of continuous data collection in an on-board memory. the proximity between individuals and temporal resolution is estimated from the power levels and timestamps contained in the data packets. the head of the household will also be asked to ensure that the correct use of the devices will be maintained throughout the study. a considerable amount of time may be spent at the school since this will be the first point of entry for the study. the school will be asked to give written consent for the school to participate in the study. study will focus on basic hygiene such as hand washing, basic science principles of health research and informing the community on various research activities that KEMRI conducts. data analysis The sensor firmware and data cleaning procedures have been developed as part of the custom SocioPatterns software. links between two individuals i and j in contact will be weighted by the cumulative duration of interaction between them. temporary data will be aggregated into time windows of 10 minutes, hourly, daily and over the entire duration of the study (7 days). ity is defined as an individual\u2019s tendency to have repeated contacts with the same individual over two time points t 1 and t 2 29. each red horizontal line represents an interaction between two individuals i (1\u20135) and j lasting s-seconds. individual 1 has zero contact events since the duration of contact is 20 secs. force directed algorithms available in the igraph package in R will be used. force-directed algorithms act upon edges while repulsive forces act between nodes. the algorithm minimizes edge crossing and node overlap. participants will also benefit from health talks that focus on prevention of communicable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea. each household will then receive two bars of hand-washing soap at the end of data collection. participants will be free to leave the study or to request the withdrawal of their data at any time and for whatever reason without explanation and without penalty. parents who attend the engagement sessions at the school will be refunded travel expenses. participants will also benefit from health talks that focus on prevention of communicable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea. predictive modelling can be used to support decision making at the national level for control of infectious disease and important to be based on locally collected data. first, it is not possible to describe full social networks at participating school and households due to the limited number of sensors available. this protocol will investigate contacts within schools and households, settings that are important for spread of respiratory infections. data in de-identified format will be open access to support future use by the wider research community or replication. access to identifiable data by people outside the investigators and specific collaborators will require permission from the senior investigators, the Data Governance Committee in KEMRI-WTRP, and where necessary, national ethics committee."}
