{"summary": "endemic microbial community of a healthy host is important to characterize. pathogenic microbes often escape detection if the clinical consequences of infection are similar to known pathogens. the maintenance of unknown pathogens in wildlife species is particularly problematic. both bacteria and viruses have been detected in the circulation. lymph nodes should concentrate the commensal, endemic, and potential pathogenic microbial communities of a host species. the method is broadly applicable to any host species. 51% of total transcript-tags could be assigned to known taxa with a bit score cutoff of 50. of the assigned tags, 99.3% were of eukaryotic origin, predominantly matching to bos taurus and other close relatives of mule deer. genomic libraries prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node tissue of MD 72360, MD 80228, MD 84709, and MD 84730 were to non-coding regions. Xylella and Burkholderia were identified in MD 72360, acidovorax was found in both MD 84709 and MD 84730. three different libraries were Burkholderia, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae. the overall bacterial diversity and the number of unique transcripts assigned to each bacterial taxon varied among the samples. many of the single transcript-tags came from MD 80228, which had the highest bacterial diversity profile of all libraries analyzed. cDNA was derived from total RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA. but it retained a considerable amount of abundant ribosomal RNA (rRNA) these sequences contribute to the \u2018no hits\u2019 category in Figure 1 and Table S2. rRNA-tags supported the presence of Helicobacter in the MD 257 library. cDNA transcript-tags analyzed against the protein database (red) and the ribosomal database (blue) and of V6 amplicon 16S rRNA-tags analyzed against the ribosomal database (green) bit score cutoff for the protein database comparison was set at 50. confidence cutoffs for the ribosomal database comparisons were set at 80%. the number of rpo- sequences for Acinetobacter in the database is limited. however, we demonstrated that the MD 80228 transcript-tag clustered with those of Acinetobacter. the mule deer gamma retrovirus forms a distinct clade within the gamma retroviruses. amplicon amplicon libraries were generated from the 454 cDNA libraries of MD 257, MD 80228, and MD OCT-pool. amplicon rRNA tags were evaluated using the RDP classifier tool (Table S5). amplicon and cDNA sequencing were performed in MD 257, MD 80228, and/or MD OCT-pool. the overall taxonomic diversity in the V6 rRNA amplicon libraries was lower than that detected in the cDNA transcript libraries. the diversity within bacterial classes was higher. on average, 51% of total transcript-tags could be assigned to known taxa with a bit score cutoff of 50. 99.3% of the assigned tags were of eukaryotic origin, predominantly matching to bos taurus and other close relatives of mule deer. only four bacterial genera were identified in the comprehensive MEGAN analysis of the four genomic data sets. Xylella and Burkholderia were identified in MD 72360, acidovorax was found in MD 84709 and bartonella in both MD 84709 and 84730. many of the single transcript-tags came from MD 80228, which had the highest bacterial diversity profile of all libraries analyzed, and from MD 84730. the lowest diversity of bacterial genera was found in the MD OCT-pool, which was derived from eight different mule deer. ated RNA retained a considerable amount of abundant ribosomal RNA (rRNA) these sequences contribute to the \u2018no hits\u2019 category in Figure 1 and Table S2. rRNA-tags from each library can provide additional support for species identification. the support for Helicobacter in the MD 257 library was particularly compelling because there were 12 unique transcript-tags and one rRNA-tag to this genus. all analyses demonstrated that the Helicobacter detected in the mule deer lymph node is a unique organism that affiliates with the H. pylori cluster. the mule deer gamma retrovirus forms a distinct clade within the gamma retroviruses. the killer whale virus was described as an endogenous retrovirus based on its finding in various tissues and individuals. amplicon and 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were used to identify bacterial microorganisms present in lymph node tissue. the hypervariable region V6 of the 16S rRNA gene was used because it has been reported to differentiate between many bacterial species. newly identified genera comprised predominantly environmental soil, sediment and water inhabitants (e.g. Aeromicrobium and Bdellovibrio), and the potential pathogens Stenotrophomonas, Rhodococcus, Rothia, and Gardnerella [40]-[43]. these findings indicate that the V6 rRNA amplicon sequencing technology is a valuable tool in complementing information about the bacterial community. transcriptome sequencing yields bacterial ribosomal RNA, which is highly expressed in metabolically active microorganisms. rRNA sequencing increased the sensitivity to detect members of some bacterial classes. cDNA-based approaches can yield an abundance of small RNA produced by complex microbial communities. the bacteria were representative of organisms that are commensal to mule deer and to their external environment. we detected the common rumen and intestine dwellers, Ruminococcus and Abiotrophia, based on transcript- and rRNA-tags in most libraries. Legionella was identified only in an individual mule deer from the Yellowstone region. phylogenetic evaluation of Helicobacter transcripts and 16S rRNA from the MD 257 cDNA library placed the respective reads in close relationship to Acinetobacter schindleri. schindleri infections appear to be increasing in prevalence in hospitalized patients [37], [58]. endemic microbiota can be detected in lymph nodes of healthy animals. meta-transcriptomic analyses of secondary lymphoid organs could be valuable in monitoring endemic infections in wildlife or livestock. these studies have the potential to cast new light on the diversity of life within and among individuals. poly(A)+RNA and cDNA Lymph node tissue cores were dissected into small pieces and further disrupted, lysed and homogenized using a steel beads. Genomic DNA was isolated from lymph nodes of four individual Mule deer (MD 72360, MD 80228, MD 84709, and MD 84730) library preparation and pyrosequencing were performed on a Roche GS20 sequencer FLX. the runs were performed on either quarter or half plates, resulting in read numbers between 10,673 and 176,878 and base numbers in the range of 1,411,420 to 41,066,808. the MD OCT-pool cDNA library was run twice due to low read and base numbers of the first run. cDNA from MD 191, which was used in the MD Bonner pool, and genomic DNA from MD 80228 were subjected to PCR. PCR conditions were 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 90 sec. amplicon products were derived from mule deer specimen MD 257, MD OCT-pool, and MD 80228. the supernatant was cleared of small RNA molecules using the MEGAclear Kit (Applied Biosystems, Ambion, CA) and depleted of host ribosomal RNA performing two cycles of the MICROBEnrich protocol. ylated bacterial mRNA (MD 257) or cDNA sequencing library samples were used as templates for the generation of 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region-specific amplicons. PCR conditions were 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 45 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec. resulting individual amplicon DNA libraries were clonally amplified by multiplex emulsion PCR followed by sequencing using the GS FLX py five mule deer (MD 257, MD 72360, MD 80228, MD 84709, and MD 84730) from different regions were analyzed individually. genomic DNA, total RNA, poly(A)+RNA and cDNA Lymph node tissue cores were dissected into small pieces. Roche-454 GS FLX pyrosequencing up to 5.0 g of cDNA or genomic DNA was subjected directly to preparation of 454-DNA libraries. the runs were performed on either quarter or half plates, resulting in read numbers between 10,673 and 176,878 and base numbers in the range of 1,411,420 to 41,066,808. the selected output reads were classified by the RDP Classifier tool (Nave Bayesian rRNA Classifier Version 2.0) the output files were analyzed with MEGAN version 3.7.2 [32] for the MD OCT-pool, the combined data of three individual 454 runs was used. maximum likelihood (ML) trees were reconstructed using PhyML version 2.4.4 [63] using the same program (PhyML) nodal supports were estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates. the trees were visualized in FigTree version 1.2.2. cDNA synthesis was subjected to cDNA synthesis (Just cDNA Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit, Stratagene, CA) cDNA derived from RNA enriched for non-polyadenylated bacterial mRNA (MD 257) or cDNA sequencing library samples derived from reverse transcribed poly(A)+RNA were used as templates for the generation of 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region-specific amplicons phylogenetic affiliation of protein-coding transcripts obtained from 454 sequencing with Helicobacter reference sequences from GenBank.
