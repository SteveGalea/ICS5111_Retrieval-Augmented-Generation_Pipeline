{"summary": "HBoV is a small nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus of the family Parvoviridae. four different species of HBoV are currently known, designated HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 (3\u20135). HBoV1 is mainly detected in respiratory secretions, while HBoV2 to HBoV4 are frequently found in stool samples from children. HBoV1 DNA has been detected in different tissues from patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis. despite the evidence for HBoV persistence, not all sites harbor such persistence are currently known. despite the evidence for HBoV persistence, not all sites harbor such persistence are currently known. adenoids and tonsils to treat adenotonsillar hypertrophy with clinical evidence of obstructive sleep apnea, or who had recurrent adenotonsillitis. a second group with 12 control patients (7 males) 1 to 12 years of age (median, 3 years) without chronic adenotonsillitis who underwent surgery for cochlear implant placement. an adenoidectomy was not performed in 6 patients; therefore HBoV1 was detected by TaqMan real-time PCR, according to a previously published protocol. the reactions were assembled in a final volume of 10 l with 50 ng of DNA, 10 mM forward and reverse primers. tests for the housekeeping control genes -actin and RNase P were done in all samples. HBoV1 qPCR was considered positive when the threshold was reached before the 40th cycle. all qPCR assays for HBoV1 were performed in triplicate. the viral loads were determined as the number of copies of HBoV1 DNA per g of tissue or per ml of NPS or blood sample. TTCAGAATGGTCACCTCT-AMGBNFQ-3\u2032) and 5 l of TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), according to the same cycling parameters used for the detection of the HBoV1 gene. all samples were tested by qualitative real-time PCR for human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza (HPIV), human coron the enrolled patients were divided in two groups: one composed of 180 patients (93 males) 1 to 18 years of age (median, 5 years) who underwent surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils to treat adenotonsillar hypertrophy with clinical evidence of obstructive sleep apnea. a second group with 12 control patients (7 males) 1 to 12 years of age (median, 3 years) without chronic adenotonsillitis who under HBoV1 was detected by TaqMan real-time PCR. the reactions were assembled in a final volume of 10 l. the reactions were assembled in a final volume of 10 l with 50 ng of DNA. HBoV1 qPCR was considered positive when the threshold was reached before the 40th cycle. the detection limit was 1 copy of HBoV1 plasmid. all qPCR assays for HBoV1 were performed in triplicate. the detection of HBoV1 mRNA was done by the same protocol used for VP1 mRNA, except for primers targeting the NP1 gene. all samples were tested by qualitative real-time PCR for human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza (HPIV), human coronaviruses (HCoV 229E and OC43), human a the detection rate was higher in samples from the adenoids (25.3%) than in palatine tonsils (PT) (7.2%), nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) (10.5%), and peripheral blood (1.7%). 49 (27.2%) had HBoV1 DNA detected in tissue fragments from AD and/or PT. positive HBoV1 negative HBoV1 positive HBoV1 negative Patients 44 130 4 8 Male genderb 29 (65.9) 62 (47.7) 3 (75.0) 4 (50.0) Median age (yr)b 4.0 6.0 2.0 4.0 Viral coinfectionb 38 (86.4) 69 (53.1) 2 (50.0) 4 (50.0) Airway obstruction 0% to 50% 3 (6.8) 14 (10.8) 50% to 75% 17 (38.6) 60 (46.1) 75% hypertrophy 11 (84.6) 137 (82.0) Sleep apneab 11 (84.6) 93 (55.6) Secretory otitis media 1 (7.7) 29 (17.3) Allergies 2 (15.4) 46 (27.5) a Data are presented as no. (%), unless otherwise indicated. the high rates of HBoV1 genomic DNA detection in AD and PT samples are indicative of a lack of a causative role for respiratory viruses. median viral loads were not significantly different between the four sample sites. in most patients, there was a pattern of increased HBoV1 viral load in AD samples compared to those in the other sites. HBoV1 DNA was detected in the peripheral blood samples from only 3 patients. HBoV viral loads in adenoid (A), palatine tonsils (B) and nasopharyngeal secretions (C) were significantly higher in patients with more severe adenoidal hypertrophy and with sleep apnea (A), whereas differences were not present in palatine tonsils (B) or in nasopharyngeal secretions (C) oV1 viral loads in adenoid, palatine tonsils, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples from patients with HBoV1 as a single agent or simultaneously detected with 1 to 4 other respiratory viruses. boxes extend from 25th to 75th percentiles, middle whiskers mark median values, and upper and lower whiskers mark the highest and the lowest values. all 3 patients with HBoV1 in the peripheral blood had viral mRNA detectable in their AD samples. the detection of HBoV1 mRNA significantly correlated with high viral load. mRNA was detected in hypertrophic PT samples from only one patient. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in a PT sample from only 1 patient. the presence of HBoV1 VP1 and/or NP1 mRNAs in AD samples showed no association with age, gender, or specific clinical features. the detection of viral coinfections was not associated with the detection of HBoV mRNA. DNA was simultaneously detected in AD, PT, and NS samples, and AD and NS samples. in 3 (5.3%) patients, HBoV1 DNA was detected in the peripheral blood and simultaneously in AD samples. in 2 of those patients, the virus was detected also in PT and NPS samples. HBoV1 genomic DNA was not detected in PT samples from the control patients (Table 2). HBoV1 genomic DNA was not detected in PT samples from the control patients (Table 2). HBoV1 genomic DNA was not detected in palatine tonsilsa. median viral load in AD samples was 1.32 106 copies of genomic DNA/g of tissue. median viral load was 8.4 104 copies/ml in patients with chronic tonsillar disease. median viral load was 2.1 104 copies/ml in patients with chronic tonsillar disease. median viral load was 1.1 103 copies/ml in peripheral blood samples. median viral loads (red lines) of HBoV1 per gram of tissue were higher in adenoid (AD) than in palatine tonsils (B), and the viral loads per ml were higher in nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples. the HBoV1 genomic loads were higher in AD samples from patients with higher degrees of adenoidal hypertrophy and with sleep apnea than in those with lesser airway obstruction median HBoV viral loads (red lines) were significantly higher in patients with more severe adenoidal hypertrophy and with sleep apnea (A) differences were not present in palatine tonsils (B) or in nasopharyngeal secretions (C) the high rates of HBoV1 genomic DNA detection and high viral loads are indirect evidence that the adenoids are an important site for HBoV1 replication in patients with chronic tonsillar diseases. the adenoids appear to be the main site of HBoV1 replication in patients with chronic tonsillar diseases. mRNA was detected in hypertrophic PT samples from only one patient. the HBoV1 viral load in that one patient was much higher than the median load of 8.4 104 obtained in PT samples. the presence of HBoV mRNAs in AD samples showed no association with age, gender, or specific clinical features. adenoids are an important site for the maintenance and replication activity of HBoV1. HBoV1 has been reported worldwide in the respiratory secretions of patients with acute respiratory infections. adenoids are located in the nasopharynx. HBoV1 was detected in adenoid samples from control patients without tonsillar hypertrophy who received cochlear implants at a frequency similar to that observed in adenoid samples from patients with tonsillar hypertrophy. in addition, HBoV1 is prone to the establishment of prolonged shedding (27) and to be detected along with other pathogenic viruses. cGAS may trigger chronic inflammation and damage stimulated by prolonged HBoV1 infection, similar to that observed with HIV (29) and herpes simplex virus (30). HBoV1 DNA has been found in the nuclei of lung cancer cells, suggesting that this virus may contribute to the development of tissue hyperplasias. adenoids are a main site of HBoV1 replication in patients with chronic adenotonsillar diseases. higher HBoV1 viral loads but not the presence of HBoV mRNAs were associated with more severe adenoidal hypertrophy and sleep apnea. persistence of HBoV1 DNA may be a contributing factor in helping to maintain chronic inflammation in already hypertrophic tonsils. supplementary material supp_52_8_3030___index.html (1.5KB, html)."}
