{"summary": "molecular mimicry is a very common phenomenon in which a living being pretends to be what it is not. the presence of a molecule in a pathogen that is similar with a host antigen could inhibit the immune response of the host against the pathogen. there are number of well documented molecular mimicry events. phosphoprotein of measles virus and Herpes simplex type I can cross-react with human intermediate filament protein vimentin. Molecular mimicry can cause several immune-mediated disease such as Grave's disease. miPepBase is an open access database that provides comprehensive information about the mimicry proteins and peptides of both host and pathogen. miPepBase can be searched using keyword(s) or by autoimmune disease(s) or by a combination of host and pathogen taxonomic groups. miPepBase also provides information about physicochemical properties of proteins containing mimicry peptides. the data of miPepBase can also be downloaded in text file. it is anticipated that miPepBase would be helpful in understanding the details of molecular mimicry. miPepBase is built using MySQL (http://www.mysql.org), Perl (http://www.perl.org), and Apache (http://www.apache.org) to provide convenience in usage, the database was developed in a user-friendly manner. in the search result, the ID is a clickable link and can display detailed information of corresponding entry. all the information can be downloaded in the text format, using the \u201cdownload button\u201d in result table. a detailed step-by-step manual is also provided to assist users in smooth and efficient searching of miPepBase. miPepBase BLAST tool is incorporated to find homologous sequence(s) and similar peptide(s) present within miPepBase database. user has to paste the sequence in the text box or upload sequence in the FASTA file to find similar sequence(s) the interface component consists of webpages designed in HTML/CSS in a Linux environment. miPepBase provides interactive access to the data and the users can connect and access the database using any one among different search options. all the information can be downloaded in the text format, using the \u201cdownload button\u201d in result table. different information related to protein sequence, structure, gene ontology and source of article were linked to UniProt, RCSB PDB, EMBL-EBI QuickGO, and PubMed respectively. a detailed step-by-step manual is also provided to assist users in smooth and efficient searching of miPepBase. different tools are also incorporated in the miPepBase to help users miPepBase has 261 entries in total. it does not mean that miPepBase contains 261 host-pathogen peptide pairs. this is due to existence of multiple mimicry peptides. miPepBase contains information of molecular mimicry based autoimmunity events caused by organisms from all taxonomic groups. pathogens are divided into four taxonomic groups namely bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Bacteria is subcategorized into gram-positive, gram-negative, and others. miPepBase submit of UniProt accession number as a keyword to the \u201cKeyword search option\u201d and click the search button. the information related to P10809 protein was presented in tabulated form. more detailed information can be retrieved through miPepBase ID of P10809. the user can search query with following options: (A) Keyword search, (B) Search by disease, (C) Search by host and pathogen taxonomic group, (D) Search by host and pathogen name. the detail of result obtained from search options (A\u2013E) is displayed by corresponding small case. the search page would list the information related to proteins involved in the rheumatoid arthritis in a tabulated form. the information content and ways to navigate different sections remain same (Step a3\u2013a6) as explained earlier for keyword search (Step a3\u2013a6) the query sequence in FASTA format can either be pasted in the text box or uploaded as sequence file (Step e1). the default e-value and scoring matrix are 100 and BLOSUM 62 respectively (Step e2). two different proteins are associated with each event of molecular mimicry. one that is encoded by the host and second which is encoded by the pathogen. names of both the proteins are present with each entry. data statistics (A) Based on pathogen taxonomic group, (B) Based on autoimmune disease. users can get the information associated to miPepBase by querying miPepBase submission of UniProt accession number as a keyword. miPepBase provides direct link to UniProt, EMBL-EBI, RCSB PDB, and PubMed. all information described above can also be downloaded as \u201cText File\u201d (Step a6) search option i.e., \u201cSearch by Diseases\u201d lists a set of disease caused by molecular mimicry and whose information is present in miPepBase. on selection of rheumatoid arthritis as the disease whose information is desired, search result page (Step b3) would be displayed. the information content and ways to navigate different sections remain same. a result page would be display that contains the search result information in tabulated form. the information content of search page will remain same as explained earlier for keyword search. the query sequence in FASTA format can either be pasted in the text box or uploaded as sequence file (Step e1). miPepBase ID (1217), host name (human), host protein name (HSP60), host mimicry peptide sequence (HRKPLVIIAEDVDGE), pathogen taxonomy (Gram positive bacteria), pathogen mimic sequence (AGKPLLIIAEDVEGE) and autoimmune disease (Rheumatoid arthritis) all these details can also be downloaded as text file (Step a2) the detail of result obtained from search options (A\u2013E) is displayed by corresponding small case (the number indicates step number) the detail of result obtained from search options (A\u2013E) is displayed by corresponding small case (the number indicates step number) mic group This option provides an easy way to do comparative analysis among mimics encoded by different pathogens of same or different taxonomic group(s) this option provides an easy way to do comparative analysis among mimics encoded by different pathogens of same or different taxonomic group(s) the default e-value and scoring matrix are 100 and BLOSUM 62 respectively (Step e2). each BLAST hit protein entry is further linked to detailed information page. each entry in the miPepBase database is linked to other molecular biology data repositories. miPepBase is a database of linear amino acid epitopes derived from a comparative genomics approach. these epitopes were predicted to be a potential molecular mimicry peptide. further mimicDB is focused on a few selected human endoparasites. miPepBase contains information related to all autoimmune diseases caused by pathogens. miPepBase host's and pathogen's mimicry peptides were curated from literature. it is possible that few peptides might have been missed. AG and BK prepared the manuscript, collected and organized the data. AG, BK, RK, and MK conceived the idea."}
