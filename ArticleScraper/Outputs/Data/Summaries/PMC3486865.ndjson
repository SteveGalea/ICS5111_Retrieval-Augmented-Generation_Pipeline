{"summary": "there are 17 HA subtypes and 10 NA subtypes, designated H1-H17 and N1-N10. the species jumping ability of IVs can result in infections of poultry and mammals, such as chicken, swine, equine or whale species. HA of all subtypes consists of conserved structures, including the signal peptide, the cytoplasm domain, the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain [16] different subtypes of NA are composed of 450480 amino acids, displaying low sequence similarity. s in the RBD, the changing of antigenic sites or N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) and the variation of the topology of N-glycan structures. the factors that influence NA include deletion of the stalk domain, the mutations drug-resistance, and the changing of antigen sites or glycosites. the existence of N-glycosylation is necessary for viral membrane glycoproteins. a detailed investigation of the distribution and evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, especially in the H5N1 virus. the amino acid sequences of HA and NA were obtained from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) Influenza Resource. the phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA were constructed by these hundreds of sequences (File S1). the phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA were constructed by MEGA5.05 with N-J methods and a p-distance model with a bootstrap value of 1000 [41], [42]. structures of various HA or NA subtypes were processed with a VMD 1.9 transformation matrix using a Tcl script. most coordinate files of envelope glycoproteins are obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR. complete larger glycans are too flexible to yield sufficient electron density. a common node meet a bootstrap value of 60 at the clade-defining node and average percentage pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades of >1.5% and 1.5% respectively. the statistics of the glycosites of each HA, as well as the corresponding NA, were recorded according to their clades (Files S3, S4 and Figure S1). the phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA were constructed by these hundreds of sequences (File S1). the phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA were constructed by MEGA5.05 with N-J methods and a p-distance model with a bootstrap value of 1000 [41], [42]. the code for each representative structure of the various subtypes of HA and NA is shown in Table S2. most coordinate files of envelope glycoproteins are obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR. complete larger glycans are too flexible to yield sufficient electron density. de and average percentage pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades of >1.5% and 1.5%, respectively, could split into the second-, third-, or even fourth-order clades [50]. the current 17 HA subtypes were concentrated in two evolutionary groups. the current 17 HA subtypes were concentrated in two evolutionary groups. two highly conserved glycosites are located near the HA0 cleavage site. another highly conserved glycosite appears at C-terminal part of the HA1 sequence. their conservative rates were influenced by different internal evolution branches. long-term cross-species infections have resulted in the accumulation of adaptive mutations and glycosites. a disadvantageous mutation would be eliminated while a virus with the gains and losses of glycosites would be conserved. a virus with the gains and losses of glycosites would be conserved. the earliest H3 record had only one moderate conservative glycosite (79NCT) except for six highly conserved glycosites, which is also conserved in most seasonal human H3N2 virus and mammalian H3N8 virus. the occurrence of 294NSS has increased the glycosite numbers to 13 in parts of current HA of H3N2 virus from 2010. 142NHT glycosite after the 1990s (e.g., A/swine/Guangdong/1604/2010 (H1N1)), 142NHT glycosite after the 1990s (e.g., A/swine/Guangdong/1604/2010 (H1N1)), swine flu (e.g., Spanish flu (e.g., A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1)) and the 2009 influenza pandemic (H conserved 181NNT glycosites have been replaced by the 179NYT in parts of clade 7 viruses since 2005. it reminds us that although these glycosites were adjacent, their N-glycans would shield different antigenic sites. this would provide suggestions for the development of influenza vaccine. a large number of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N2 and H9N2 viruses have accumulated numerous glycosites in N1 and N2 especially in the global domain. one conserved glycosite, 12NTT (Conservative rate: 93%, e.g., A/turkey/Italy/3807/2004 (H7N3)), located in the transmembrane domain in N3 and N10. a similar deletion of 20 residues and two glycosites (I-E-60R-20-80N-I-I) appeared in most NA subtypes of the H6N2 virus (e.g., A/duck/Fujian/3193/2005 (H6N2)) a similar deletion of 20 residues and two glycosites (C-E-55P-16-72T-T-E) was a distinctive part of the H7N2 virus. cken/Scotland/1959 (H5N1)\u201d had four continuous basic residues in the HA0 cleavage site. the stalked deletion of NA also existed in A/turkey/Ontario/84/1983 (H5N1). the records of H5N1 virus have increased rapidly since 2003. the evolution of four conserved glycosites in the stalk domain and five unconserved glycosites showed the frequence and diversity have falled rapidly after 2007. both twelve glycosites were found in the HA and NA of the H5N1 virus, shown in the Tables 1 and 2 and Files S3 and S4. six highly conserved glycosites together with 170NST exist widely in clade 0. since 2003, the WHO has recorded a three-wave epidemic of H5N1, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and huge economic losses. most currently recorded H5N1 viruses were concentrated in the fourth-order clades. most viruses in clade 2.2, except for clade 2.2.1.1, lack the 170N glycosite created by the T172A mutation. the lack of 170NST would enhance the HA affinity for SA receptors, especially to SA2-6Gal sialoglycans, which could be one reason for the propensity of clade 2.2.1 to infect humans. the conserved glycosite is located at the apical -folding of HA. previous statistics have indicated that this glycosite has a lower level of conservation in avian IVs (e.g., A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-093/2008 (H5N1)) the patterns of stalk domain deletion have two stages, with difference in 50NQS. the deletion of the stalk domain in H5N1 NA is variable. a similar motif could be found even in 1983. phylogenetic trees of HAs and NAs were constructed using three to ten representative amino acid sequences in each subtype (File S1) the distribution charts of glycosites, colored according to the statistics of conservation in each HA or NA subtype (File S2), are shown in various strips. the red, green and blue color represent the levels of conservation of \u201c>95%\u201d, \u201c5%95%\u201d and \u201c5%\u201d, respectively. ERp53, which is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds during the folding of nascent proteins, would form a complex with calreticulin/calnexin, which depends on precursor N-glycans. long-term cross-species infections have resulted in the accumulation of adaptive mutations and glycosites. the pattern of stalk domain deletion in N2 NA is distinctive in different combinations of IVs. the representative NA sequences in each available N2 subtypes are aligned in the stalk domain. a new glycosite emerged in the restructured NA of the avian H2N2 virus. 179NKS glycosites identified were centralized in swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIVs, e.g., A/Swine/Guandong/1604/2010 (H1N1)) and parts of the 2009 influeza pandemic (H1N1). most glycosites were influenced by the deletion or insertion of the mutants in the upstream sequence. the 177NLS glycosite was found in the swine or human H1N2 viruses (e.g., A/New York/481/2003 (H1N2)) and most seasonal flu viruses (e.g., A/California/04/2007 (H1N1)) the conserved 181NNT glycosites have been replaced by the 179NYT in parts of clade 7 viruses since 2005. glycosite of 146N is conservative in all NA subtypes. it has been shown that the N-glycan at this glycosite affects NA enzymatic activity, causing a 20-fold decrease in activity. the variance of the glycosites was closely related to the deletion of the stalk domain. no deletions were found in the NA of the H3N2 virus. deletion of 3 residues and one corresponding glycosite with pattern \"E-R-61N-3-64T-V-H\" a similar deletion of 20 residues and two glycosites appeared in most NA subtypes of the H6N2 virus. the earliest H5N1 virus, \u201cA/chicken/Scotland/1959 (H5N1)\u201d, had four continuous basic residues in the HA0 cleavage site. the stalk deletion of NA also existed in A/turkey/Ontario/84/1983 (H5N1). the records of H5N1 virus have increased rapidly since 2003. the ealiest H5N1 virus record first appeared in 1957 and increased rapidly after 2004. the early H5N1 viruses belonged to clade 0 and diversified after 2002. the most common clade 2.2 and 2.3 became dominant after 2008. most H5N1 viruses were grouped into clade 0 before it appeared in hong Kong again in 2003. these original viruses contained the known glycosites, including four highly conserved glycosites in the stalk domain and seven in the global domain. since 2003, the WHO has recorded a three-wave epidemic of H5N1 which resulted in hundreds of deaths. clade 2.2 was involved in the outbreak that occurred near Qinghai Lake in 2005. in 2006, the virus appeared in africa for the first time, followed by hundreds of mortally infected humans in Egypt, Nigeria and Djibouti. d glycosites (>95%) are shown in red spheres, while the remainder are shown in cyan spheres. the deletion of the stem domain would decrease four Glycosites. ylated and non-glycosylated 170N and 181N co-existed even before 1997. most viruses in clade 2.2 and clade 2.3.2 displayed the deficiency of 158N glycosite. clade 1.1 and clade 2.3.4 exhibited the conservation of the 158N glycosite. viral glycoproteins can bind to one specific glycan structure known as the lectin or GBP. other viral glycoproteins, such as HN in the Newcastle Disease Virus or NA in IVs, function as the exoglycosidase in the release of virus particles. the HA or NA subtypes exhibited low similarities of amino acid sequences in all subtypes while maintaining identical structures. the cysteines take the main role in stabilizing the tertiary structure. conservation verifies that cysteines and N-glycans played an important role in protein folding and quality control. glycosites in HAs and NAs has provided basic information for vaccine design, host selection and changing virulence. however, infection is a complex process; the alternation of glycosites and glycan shapes may affect the functions of glycoproteins. there are other mutations also worthy of further consideration, such as the E627K in the PB2 protein that enhances the avian viral replication capacity in mammalian cells [76], [77]. asterisk represents sites that were only calculated in the full stem domain. the asterisk represents those sites that were only calculated in the full stem domain.
