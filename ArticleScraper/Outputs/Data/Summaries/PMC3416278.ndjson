{"summary": "PRRSV is caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) it is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales (14) the PRRSV genome encodes 7 structural proteins and 14 nonstructural proteins (51) IL-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in a wide range of biological activities. it is produced by a variety of cell types including activated monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes (8). IL-15 receptor shares the IL-2 and chain (IL-15/IL-2R) with IL-2 receptor complex. IL-15 regulates the number of the memory and nave CD8+ T cells. PRRSV induces a persistent viral infection, suggesting an inefficient cellular immune response. cytotoxic function of CD8+ and NK cells is downregulated. PRRSV N protein was proved to be involved in IL-15 production. we further cloned and identified a PRRSV-inducible region in the porcine IL-15 promoter. this region consists of IFN regulatory factor element (IRF-E) and NF-B motifs. monocytes from PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were washed with 10% FBS, recombinant porcine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. at day 6, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added (1 g/ml) (Sigma) IL-15 gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and presented as fold induction relative to medium control. PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+. the PRRSV N protein deletion mutants were constructed using specific primers. all of the deletion mutants' products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ vector. the fragment flanking the porcine IL-15 gene 5\u2032 sequence was obtained by using a genomic walking kit. the primers SP1 to SP3 were based on the Sus scrofa IL-15 gene (NM_214390.1) the fragment was subcloned into the pMD18-T vector and the nucleotide sequence was determined by DNA sequencing. the IL-15 promoter deletion mutants were generated by PCR using the forward primers 5\u2032-GCCCCCGGGAATATACCAAATAATAAGC-3\u2032 (for 579/77-luc), 5\u2032-TCCCCCGGGCATCATCATAGGGCTGTAAATGCTAAAC-3\u2032 (for 372/77-luc), and 5\u2032-TCCCCCCCGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 82 (1 M) for 1 h and then infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1 in the presence of the inhibitors. 24 h later cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 3 for 24 h in the presence or absence of the NF-B inhibitor. amounts of protein from each extract were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following primary antibodies diluted as indicated. the antibodies were visualized using the ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Marc-145 cells seeded on a 12-well plate were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) with IL-15 373/77-luc, 373/77(NF-B)-luc, 373/77(IRF)-luc, or pGL3-luc luciferase vector (1 g for each plasmid) cells were then harvested for luciferase activity analysis 24 h later. luciferase assays were performed with extracts prepared using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. all experiments were performed with at least three independent replicates. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. monocytes from PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were washed with 10% FBS, recombinant porcine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rpGM-CSF) at day 6, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added (1 g/ml) (Sigma) IL-15 gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and presented as fold induction relative to medium control. PCR products were subcloned using specific primers. the PRRSV N protein deletion mutants were constructed using specific primers. the deletion mutants' products were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1+ vector. the fragment flanking the porcine IL-15 gene 5\u2032 sequence was obtained by using a genomic walking kit (TaKaRa, Japan) the fragment was subcloned into the pMD18-T vector, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by DNA sequencing. IL-15 promoter sequence from nucleotides (nt) 1023 to +77 relative to the translation initiation site (+1) was inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic at the BglII site to create the IL-15 promoter (1023/77-luc) the IL-15 promoter deletion mutants were generated by PCR using the forward primers 5\u2032-GCCCCCGGGAATATACCAAATAAGC-3\u2032 (for 579 NF-B inhibitor BAY11-7082 (1 M) for 1 h and then infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1 in the presence of the inhibitors. 24 h later cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 3 for 24 h. similar amounts of protein from each extract were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following primary antibodies diluted as indicated. the antibodies were visualized using the ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Marc-145 cells seeded on a 12-well plate were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) with IL-15 373/77-luc, 373/77(NF-B)-luc, 373/77(IRF)-luc, 373/77(NF-B, IRF)-luc, or pGL3-luc luciferase vector (1 g for each plasmid) luciferase assays were performed with extracts prepared using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. all experiments were performed with at least three independent replicates. RESULTS PRRSV upregulates IL-15 production in PAMs, BMo, and DCs. IL-15 is upregulated in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), blood monocyte-derived macrophages (BMo) and blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR (A, C, and E) a 1,100-bp fragment of the 5\u2032-flanking region of porcine IL-15 gene was cloned. several putative transcriptional regulatory elements were found in the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pIL-15 gene. 1023/77-luc, 579/77-luc, 372/77-luc, and 172/77-luc porcine IL-15 promoter vectors were transfected into pGL3 basic luciferase vectors. twenty-four hours later, cells were inoculated with PRRSV (MOI = 3.0) or medium. IL-15 promoter construct 372/77-luc contains an IRF-E motif and an NF-B motif. the cells were cotransfected with 372/77-luc promoter plasmid and each of the PRRSV structural protein expression vectors. the cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase activity was measured. 3.1 vector control, were cotransfected into CRL2843 with pIL-15 372/77 promoter pGL3 vector. forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested for luciferase activity detection. IL-15 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. each mutant vector was cotransfected into CRL2843 cells with constructs encoding pIL-15 full-length promoter 1023/77-luc. the luciferase activities were measured 48 h later. pIL-15 promoter luciferase activity was as efficiently as the intact PRRSV N protein. NLS 41 to 47, N-N noncovalent interaction, and noLS domains of N protein were essential for pIL-15 promoter activation. the lack of any of these domains could lead to the decrease of pIL-15 promoter activation. MAPK inhibitor SB202190 had no effect on PRRSV-induced IL-15 production. these findings suggest that the PKC and NF-B pathways may be involved in PRRSV-induced IL-15 production. Marc-145 cells were pretreated with NF-B inhibitor (BAY11-7082 [BAY]) or DMSO control for 1 h. then transfected with pIL-15 372/77-luc pGL3 vector or pGL3-luc basic control vector. twenty-four hours later, cells were infected with PRRSV. PAMs infected with PRRSV for different time periods (0.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) were collected for Western analysis using a phospho-specific antibody for p-IB- and an antibody for IB. however, the IB protein level started to decrease 30 min post-PRRSV infection. PRRSV N protein was transfected with different amounts of PRRSV N protein. the cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. the results showed that in untransfected cells, p65 (green) existed in cytoplasm. the promoter region responding to PRRSV infection to 372/77 contains the binding elements for NF-B and IRF-E. we deleted either the NF-B or the IRF-E binding element or both from pIL-15 372/77. the mutants were identified as 372/77(NF-B)-luc, 372/77(IRF-E)-luc and 372/77(NF-B, IRF-E)-luc. pIL-15 372/77 promoter region impairs PRRSV-induced IL-15 production. NF-B binding motif in pIL-15 372/77 promoter region is essential for IL-15 production. mutants were cotransfected with PRRSV N expression vector into CRL2843 cells. cells were harvested and measured for luciferase activity 48 h later. without the NF-B motif, the IL-15 promoter was fully repressed (9-fold decrease) compared with that of intact 372/77-luc. similar results were obtained with other strains such as VR2332 (the prototypical North American type 2 isolate), AV (a type 2 isolate from China) and HV (an HP-PRRSV isolate) however, IL-15 induction by strain HV was postponed until 36 h postinfection. a 1,100-bp fragment of the 5\u2032-flanking region of porcine IL-15 gene was cloned using the genome walking kit. several putative transcriptional regulatory elements were found in the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pIL-15 gene. the 1,100-bp porcine IL-15 promoter gene 5\u2032-flanking region is shown in boxes. positions of the putative regulatory motifs relative to the translation initiation site ATG are shown (denoted as +1) IL-15 promoter construct 172/77-luc has a regulatory motif that downregulates its transcription. the construct 372/77-luc promoter was much more efficiently stimulated by PRRSV infection than the others. PRRSV N protein (ORF7) significantly induced IL-15 production. PRRSV N protein induces IL-15 production in CRL2843 cells. however, none of the PRRSV nonstructural proteins can increase IL-15 gene expression. PRRSV N protein contains two nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences. mutants included C85 (1 to 85 aa), C50 (1 to 50 aa), C43 (1 to 43 aa), C25 (1 to 25 aa), N18 (18 to 123 aa), N29 (29 to 123 aa), N40 (40 to 123 aa), and N69 (69 to 123 aa) luciferase activities were measured 48 h later. PRRSV N protein and its mutants to activate the pIL-15 372/77-luc promoter were stronger than that of the full-length promoter (1023/77-luc) this observation reinforced the presumption that the pIL-15 full-length promoter contains a negative regulatory element at the region of 1023/377. the expressions of IL-15 were analyzed by real-time PCR. GF-109203X (PKC inhibitor) and BAY11-7082 (NF-B inhibitor) significantly inhibited the induction of IL-15 gene expression by PRRSV infection. NF-B (BAY11-7082 [BAY]), MEK (PD98059 [PD]), PI3K (LY294002 [LY]), MAPK (SB202190 [SB]), or DMSO control for 1 h. twenty-four hours later, total RNAs were extracted for detecting IL-15 mRNA by real-time PCR (A), and cell culture supernatants were harvested for testing IL-15 protein by ELISA ( PRRSV and PRRSV N protein activate NF-B. it is well known that the activation of NF-B requires phosphorylation-mediated IB degradation. CRL2843 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 control vector (C) or transfected with PRRSV N protein expression vector (D and E) for 24 h. NF-B p65 (green) and PRRSV N protein (red) were then detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining by antibodies against p65 and PRRSV N protein. pIL-15 promoter has several regulatory motifs including NF-B and IRF-E binding sites. we have mapped the promoter region responding to PRRSV infection to 372/77, which contains the binding elements for NF-B and IRF-E. response to PRRSV infection was only slightly affected compared to that of the intact 372/77-luc. deletion of NF-B and IRF-E binding elements impairs PRRSV-induced IL-15 production. pIL-15 promoter deletion mutant constructs were inoculated with PRRSV. -luc, or pGL3 basic control vector, was cotransfected into CRL2843 cells. cells were harvested and measured for luciferase activity 48 h later. NF-B motif is critical for PRRSV-induced IL-15 production. NF-B signaling pathways significantly reduced IL-15 production in these cells. we also showed that PRRSV N protein could induce IL-15 in porcine IL-15 promoter. IL-15 release was reduced significantly by UV inactivation. NF-B could be activated 30 min after PRRSV inoculation. it was believed that this activation was independent of virus replication. however, the HP-PRRSV strain HV-induced IL-15 production was dramatically delayed, as IL-15 mRNA expression was not increased until 36 h postinfection. treatment of porcine alveolar macrophages with NF-B inhibitor significantly reduced IL-15 production compared with what was seen for cells infected by PRRSV only. NF-B defines a family of dimeric transcription factors, and the predominant species of the NF-B family is the p50\u2013p65 complex, which is retained in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IB (27). the IRF-E motif was demonstrated to be an essential element of the virus-inducible region of the mouse IL-15 promoter. deletion of the IRF-E motif dramatically reduced promoter activity in mouse cell line L929 infected by Newcastle disease virus (8). however, deletion of the IRF-E binding site only slightly reduced promoter activity induced by PRRSV and PRRSV N protein. the luciferase activity of full-length IL-15 promoter was low compared to that of the truncated (372/77) promoter. however, we suspect that other regulatory transcription elements may exist at the region of 1023/372. IL-15 knockout mice were significantly less antigen-specific CD44+CD8+ T cells in the lungs. however, the survival rate of these mice was reduced by adoptive transfer of the CD8+ T cells. IL-15-dependent CD8+ T cells are at least partially responsible for the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia caused by influenza A virus (42) further research will provide new insights into the molecular mechanism controlling the IL-15 production induced by PRRSV infection."}
