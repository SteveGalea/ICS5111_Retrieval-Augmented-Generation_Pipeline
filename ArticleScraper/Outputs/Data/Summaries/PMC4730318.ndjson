{"summary": "RNase-L is an endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded RNA as the effector portion of a two-component system regulated by the antiviral type I and III interferons. oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) generate 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A). 2-5A then binds to RNase-L, leading to its dimerization and non-canonical functions for RNase-L include induction of senescence and shortened lifespan, cellular differentiation, colitis susceptibility, the demyelination of axons, lipid storage, and the development of diabetes. innate immune regulation is activated by the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) IFN signals through its cognate receptor to induce the transcription of several hundred genes (IFN-stimulated genes, ISG) there are four human OAS genes that encode 8\u201310 isoforms as a result of alternative splicing, and 12 murine OAS genes [35] each of these genes and their isoforms are differentially expressed in various tissues and can occupy different subcellular compartments. OAS polymerizes ATP into 2-5A (px5\u2032A(2\u2032p5\u2032A)n; n 2) which can then bind to and activate RNase-L. 2-5A can be degraded within minutes by a 2\u2032-phosphodiesterase (2\u2032PDE) that breaks 2\u2032-5\u2032 bonds to remove 2-5A subunits from the activating multimer, or by phosphatases that remove the 5\u2032 phosphate groups from 2-5A. the kinase-extension nuclease domain (KEN) is normally repressed due to interactions between the ankyrin repeat domain and the enzymatic domain. however upon binding to 2-5A, a conformational change in the KEN domain occurs to expose the pseudokinase and ribonuclease domains. these interactions mediate dimerization and enzymatic activation within minutes. mRNA targeting can facilitate RNase-L-dependent regulation of gene expression through direct cleavage of transcripts or indirectly through the destabilization of transcriptional regulators. mRNA targeting can facilitate RNase-L-dependent regulation of gene expression through direct cleavage of transcripts or indirectly through the destabilization of transcriptional regulators. RNase-L has eight AREs, and deletion mapping indicates that there are both positive and negative regulatory elements in the 3\u2032UTR. the two AREs closest to the 3\u2032 terminus are stabilized by HuR. even low-to-moderate changes in RNase-L expression yield significant functional impact as RNA cleavage activity is disproportionately enhanced. eRF3 is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily. it is believed to be involved in translation termination and ribosome recycling. the mechanism for RNase-L inhibition is believed to be through direct binding with RLI. however, overexpression of RLI has inhibitory or promoting effects on the binding of RNase-L to 2-5A. RNase-L localization with this translation termination complex places it in close proximity to potential mRNA targets. when active, RNase-L can outcompete PABP for eRF3 interaction in the termination complex, displacing it and providing RNase-L access to mRNA substrates. if excess IF2mt was introduced to the system, the degradation of mtRNAs was suppressed. this resulted in an increase in proliferation and a decrease in apoptotic signaling. a third interacting protein may aid in providing this target specificity. the nuclease Regnase-1 contains both endoribonucleolytic activity like RNase-L and a CCCH-type zinc finger that mediates mRNA binding similar to TTP. it essentially combines the activities of RNase-L and TTP into a single enzyme, setting precedent for this cooperative function. AREBP post-transcriptional regulators are strong contenders because of its preference for UU and UA dinucleotides. the prototypical virus for demonstrating RNase-L activity is the picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) the prototypical virus for demonstrating RNase-L activity is the picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) the prototypical virus for demonstrating RNase-L activity is the picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) a relatively new mechanism for inhibiting RNase-L activity was identified in the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. the MHV ns2 gene encodes its own 2\u2032phosphodiesterase to degrade 2-5A. the MHV ns2 gene encodes its own 2\u2032phosphodiesterase. MHV-ns2 is a potent antagonist of the OAS/RNase-L pathway. a more detailed analysis of these and other viral evasion mechanisms are reviewed by Drappier et al. a new antimicrobial role for RNase-L helps maintain the intercellular barrier formed by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayers, preventing pathogen translocation from the gut into the host. many types of bacteria may activate RNase-L through endocytosis and either escape of the bacterium or leakage of RNA into cytosol during infection. Zhou et al. [15] confirmed this role for RNase-L in Fas, TNF, and -CD3 antibody-induced apoptosis. further characterization showed that RNase-L-dependent cell death resulted in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. this early described role may be partially coordinated with a newly discovered function in the induction of autophagy. the exact mechanisms for many of the cellular functions of RNase-L are unknown. it is widely believed that regulation of gene expression plays a major role in facilitating these activities, such as the modulation of the immune response. functions have shown that macrophages deficient in RNase-L exhibit decreased migration, endocytic activity, and proinflammatory gene regulation. these data clearly indicate that RNase-L has an important role in immune cell function, including the adaptive response. innate immune regulators also interact with the OAS/RNase-L pathway. RNase-L Antiviral Activity RNase-L was initially discovered and characterized as a mediator of type I IFN antiviral activity. other important pathways have become evident, such as regulation of host gene expression, stimulation of IFN production, activation of the NACHT, LRR, and PYD-containing protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and maintenance of the cell\u2019s structural barrier to infection. overexpression of RNase-L has been shown to suppress EMCV replication. dominant-negative RNase-L inhibits IFN-induced protection against infection. other members of the Picornaviridae family have adapted mechanisms for evading RNase-L activity. NS1 binds to and sequesters dsRNA in order to prevent activation of viral sensors RIG-I, OAS, and the IFN-induced protein kinase PKR. this mechanism may not be completely efficient throughout the course of infection, potentially resulting in low levels of free 2-5A. a relatively new mechanism for inhibiting RNase-L activity was identified in the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. in 2008, we demonstrated that RNase-L KO mice are more susceptible to sublethal infection by both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus anthracis (BA) than WT mice. multiple mechanisms were found to contribute to this sensitivity. many types of bacteria may activate RNase-L through endocytosis. RNA in actively replicating bacteria is not exposed to cytosolic RNase-L. many other antimicrobial functions of RNase-L may be more prominent in these types of infections. a double-membraned autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome in order to degrade its contents into reusable components. the signaling involved in activating this process involves both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and PKR, resulting in the degradation of p62 (SQSTM1), LCSBI/LCS3BII conversion, and the accumulation of autophagosomes. melanoma differentiation associated gene-5) stimulates mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and induces translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to the nucleus to drive transcription of IFN. KO mice have enlarged thymuses, likely due to defects in apoptosis. the possible involvement of RNase-L in immune cell function is not surprising. RNase-L is activated following virus infection to generate small RNA cleavage products that bind to the DExD/H helicase DHX33. this leads to the formation of a DHX33, NLRP3 and MAVS complex. overexpression of NOD2 when OAS is active leads to increased RNase-L activity. a 1998 study by Tnani et al. used biochemical methods to detect RNase-L in the cytoskeletal fraction of cell extracts. they demonstrated that RNase-L associated with the cytoskeleton in a conformation that did not allow it to bind 2-5A. this supports a model in which cytoskeletal association is incompatible with RNase-L activity. IQGAP1 is a 190 kDa protein that shares a number of biological functions with RNase-L. IQGAP1 alters TJ assembly by reducing recruitment of claudin 2 and increasing assembly of claudin 4 into TJ complexes. it also diminishes barrier function by inhibiting the Cdc42-JNK signaling pathway. ECyd is a cytotoxic nucleoside analogue that is active against cancer cells. both RNase-L and IQGAP1 were necessary for ECyd-induced apoptosis in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. the diminished uptake of virus in RNase-L-expressing cells was sufficient to inhibit overall virus production. this was complemented by similar results in the presence or absence of FLNA. this localization may also place RNase-L in immediate proximity to virus that is able to bypass this first layer of host defense. the interaction between LNX and RNase-L was confirmed in 293T cells and mapped to the C-terminus of RNase-L and the PDZ domain-containing C-terminus of LNX. a proteomic screen for potential LNX ubiquitylation substrates identified 64 candidate interactors, and yeast data suggest that the LNXp80 and p70 isoforms can form homo- or hetero-oligomers, potentially forming large complexes interaction with LNX validated our model for a role for RNase-L in the cytoskeleton. it does not ubiquitylate RNase-L, a known target of modification. this lack of regulation or modification may indicate that LNX is functioning as a scaffold when binding to RNase-L. FLNA and LNX are capable of interacting with each other in a manner that is not altered by RNase-L overexpression. the presence of Ub-HA-conjugated RNase-L was determined by Western blot. the presence of exogenous RNase-L did not alter the interaction. a model in which FLNA, LNX, and RNase-L form a complex associated with the actin cytoskeleton. this complex supports membrane integrity to inhibit endocytosis or viral entry. cytoskeletal interactions with components of innate immunity are key targets. the IFN and inflammasome pathways are key targets. arrows denote direct interactions and dashed arrows signify intermediary steps occur. in depolymerization leads to relocalization to punctate domains. TBK1 GEF-H1 RLR activation induces GEF-H1 dephosphorylation, release from microtubules, and binding to TBK1 Chiang et al. IFITM1 Occludin, Claudin1, and ZO-1 Enhances the interaction between HCV receptors occludin and CD81. RIG-I was found to localize to the apico-lateral cell junctions and tight junctions of polarized intestinal epithelial cells. FAK is a protein tyrosine kinase localized to focal adhesion (ECM) contacts with the extracellular matrix. FAK-deficient cells are defective in IFN expression and more susceptible to virus infections. NOD2 can be activated by bacterial PAMPs and viral ssRNA. it is sequestered in a latent state until actin disruption, potentially by infection, releases it to begin signaling. treatment of cells with cytD or the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B significantly increased NF-B signaling. in the absence of ASC, Dock2 levels are low, resulting in inactive Rac and deficient filamentous actin production. this inability to polymerize actin would severely diminish active processes like endocytosis and cell migration. KO cells contain less than one third of the amount of filamentous actin as WT cells. the suppression of gelsolin activity by PKR represents a novel antiviral mechanism. ADAP2 is an IFN-inducible, GTPase-activating protein for Arf6. it associates with and can control actin dynamics, as well as induce membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis, leading to the formation of ADAP2-associated vesicles. this shifts the endocytic association of Dengue virus and vesicular stomatitis virus into these ADAP2-positive vesicles. avSGs are linked to antiviral stress granules that form after virus infection. avSGs are linked to stress granules which form during cellular stress from inhibiting translation and are linked to the cytoskeleton. avSGs are related to stress granules which form during cellular stress from inhibiting translation. an alternative function of this association between members of the innate immune response and the cytoskeleton may be to sequester these proteins to prevent unintended activation. inflammasome activation requires a priming step to transcriptionally induce IL-1 and IL-18. this upstream role may explain why TLR signaling molecules that are activated by cytoskeletal perturbations have not yet been identified."}
