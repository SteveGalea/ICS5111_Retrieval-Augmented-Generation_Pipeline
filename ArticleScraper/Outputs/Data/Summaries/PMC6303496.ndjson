{"summary": "14 clinically diseased broiler flocks from western and central Algeria were sampled and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. results: QX (100%) and 4/91 (60%) IBV serotypes were the most prevalent in the kidney damaged broilers regardless of vaccination status. the IBV has been identified as the major cause of respiratory infections and poor zootechnical performances. it can also multiply in the renal tissue and cause nephritis. nephritis associated with infectious bronchitis has been observed in several vaccinated flocks. a large number of serotypes or variants of IBV have emerged. iler flocks were sampled and analyzed by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by phylogenic analysis. sample collection Fourteen commercial broiler flocks from western and central Algeria were sampled between January and December 2012. RNA purity and concentration were determined by nanoDrop\u00ae ND\u20131000 (Peqlab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). RNA purity and concentration were determined by nanoDrop\u00ae ND\u20131000 (Peqlab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). 0.1 M lyophilized oligonucleotides provided with the kit were dissolved in 1 mL RNase-free water. the PCR parameters were as follows: 45 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C, 20 s), annealing (51\u00b0C, 1 min) and polymerization (72\u00b0C, 1 min) the pre-denaturation step was done at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and post-polymerization step at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. a 20 L aliquot of each PCR product was electrophoresed at 120 V for 40 min in 1.5% agarose gel. HI test The specific IBV strains that were used in this study were M\u201341 (a US strain), 4/91 (European vaccine strain), D274 (a Dutch field isolate), and QX D388 (DQ674739). the results were reported as the GMT for a given flock against a particular IBV antigen. the samples were taken from 10 diseased chickens from each flock. they were directly applied to the FTA\u00ae cards during the acute phase of the clinical outbreak. the samples were transported and analyzed at the laboratory of Virology. 1 mL of the random primer solution was mixed with 4 L viral RNA. mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 55\u00b0C for 60 min. reaction was terminated by heating at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. the pre-denaturation step was done at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and post-polymerization step at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. a 20 L aliquot of each PCR product was electrophoresed at 120 V for 40 min in 1.5% agarose gel. the amplified cDNA was purified using the NucleoSpin\u00ae (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH, Germany) Gel and PCR Clean-up kit. HI test was performed using the FLOKSCREEN IB-HI TEST kit. the sera were serially diluted and mixed with an equivalent volume of the antigen. after 30 min of incubation, the red blood cells of SPF chickens were added. the plates were then tilted to observe inhibition of hemagglutination. all the broiler flocks (100%) tested in this study were seropositive for antibodies against the 4/91 and M\u201341 strains. the seroprevalence of IBV D\u2013274 was the lowest with only 7% of the broiler flocks testing positive. Flocks Mean titers (log2) Mean titers range (maximum-minimum) (log2) Qx M\u201341 D\u2013274 4/91 Qx M\u201341 D\u2013274 4/91 1 11.00 5.80 4.70 7.00 11\u201411 4\u20149 4\u20149 6\u201411 2 11.00 7.00 4.64 7.55 11\u201411 5\u201410 4\u20147 7\u20149 3 9.70 6.50 5.20 7.20 7\u201411 4\u201411 4\u20148 the IBDZ13a strain was characterized as an IB 4/91 variant IBV with 29 nucleic acid substitutions. the predicted epitopes with differences between the field virus and IB 4/91 vaccine strain are shown in Figure-1. new serotypes and genotypes of IBV frequently emerge and have been reported in different regions around the world. more recently, IBV has been associated with nephritis which is now a major problem in broiler flocks worldwide. no study has been performed so far on IB-associated nephritis. the serological analysis showed significantly lower titers of IB 4/91 compared to IB-QX. this is consistent with the lower anti-IB 4/91 antibody titers seen in the vaccinated flocks compared to the unvaccinated ones. cross-reaction between the different serotypes can reduce the sensitivity of HI. RT-PCR and HI results showed significant differences (20-50%) in the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit. the presence of multiple cross-reactive antibodies reduces the serodiagnostic value of HI. a combination of serotyping and genotyping is recommended to identify field strains. only two flocks received combined vaccine of IB ma5 and IB 4/91. failure to protect broilers against nephritis could also be related to shorter inter-vaccination interval of 7 days."}
