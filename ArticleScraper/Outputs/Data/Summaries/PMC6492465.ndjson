{"summary": "studies conducted in industrialized countries report a prevalence of respiratory tract infections ranging from 3.4 to 32.1% in the first year of life (1\u20134). breastfeeding is included among the protective factors for respiratory infections in infants. a case-control study was conducted in one large metropolitan pediatric hospitals, located in Rome, Italy, between June 2012 and February 2018. the study was supported by the ECDC (European Center for Disease Control) within the pertinent project (Pertussis in Infants European Network), a european hospital-based network dedicated to measuring pertussis burden. samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected within 24 h from hospital admission and processed immediately. nucleic acids were extracted from a 200 l sample of nasopharyngeal aspirates and purified. 0.05 was considered statistically significant. study included in same group artificial feeding + partial breastfeeding at symptom onset or at enrolment. patients admitted for a respiratory tract infection routinely underwent a nasopharyngeal aspirate, which was tested with a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 14 respiratory viruses. patients 6 months of age with a positive RT-PCR for one of these viruses were enrolled as cases. data were collected through a questionnaire administered to parents of patients at enrolment, after signing an informed consent. a sample of 490 patients was sufficient to show an odds ratio of 0.6 for exclusively breastfed infants vs. infants with partial breastfeeding. we enrolled a total of 496 patients: 238 cases and 258 healthy controls. healthy controls were older than cases (mean age of controls 2.38 months, mean age of cases 1.99 months, p 0.001) proportion of premature babies significantly higher in cases than in controls (21 vs. 7%, p 0.001) birth weight in kg (mean, sd) 3.0 (0.6) 3.2 (0.5) 3.11 (0.58) 0.001 Caesarean birth (n, %) 117 (49.2) 107 (41.5) 224 (45.2) 0.086 Employed mother (n, %) 138 (58.0) 158 (61.2) 296 (59.7) 0.460 Employed father (n, %) 221 (92.9) 238 (93.0) 459 (0.91) 0.0 a total of 74 patients (31.1%) had complications during hospital admission. nearly a half of these (49.4%) had a RSV infection. having at least one sibling was associated to a higher risk of viral respiratory infection (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.14\u20135.92) as well as having a smoking mother (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.33\u20134.89) being exclusively breastfed at symptom onset was associated with a higher risk of viral respiratory infection. the proportion of premature babies was significantly higher in cases than in controls (21 vs. 7%, p 0.001). the proportion of mothers and fathers with a university degree was higher in controls (for mothers 39.5 vs. 28.6% respectively, p = 0.010; for fathers, 31.4 vs. 21.9% respectively, p = 0.017). the number of households was higher in cases (mean 4.5) than in controls (mean 3.7, p 0.00 the median duration of hospital admission was 6 days with no differences by type of virus. a total of 74 patients (31.1%) had complications during hospital admission, and nearly a half had a RSV infection. symptom onset (n, %) 106 (44.5) 126 (48.8) 232 (46.8) 0.626 Days of exclusive breastfeeding prior to enrollment (mean, sd) 35.8 (42.97) 41.6 (36.97) 38.8 (40.02) 0.110 Never breastfed (n, %) 85 (35.7) 72 (27.9) 157 (31.7) 0.62 A proportion of 46.8% of enrolled patients were exclusively breastfed at enrollment. protection increased with breastfeeding duration (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97\u20130.99). study confirms association between maternal smoking and the risk of having a viral respiratory infection (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.33\u20134.89) mortality and hospitalizations for respiratory infection and other infectious diseases (31), SIDS (32), wheezing and asthma (33\u201335). the association of maternal smoking and respiratory conditions seems to be linked to the interference of nicotine on lung development (36). despite this, the multivariable analysis identified exclusive breastfeeding as a risk factor for VRI. we recently published a study exploring the pattern of contacts within the households of infants younger than 6 months. we showed that families in which the baby is exclusively breastfed tend to have a more intense contact pattern compared to families in which the infant receives artificial of mixed feeding. the influence of breastfeeding on contact patterns may vary depending on geographic contexts. exclusive breastfeeding should be promoted for the first six months of life. the longer the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, the stronger the protection. symptomatic mothers should thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before touching the infant. conflict of interest Statement AT has received research grants for vaccine studies from Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Pfizer and Glaxo SmithKline. the remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
