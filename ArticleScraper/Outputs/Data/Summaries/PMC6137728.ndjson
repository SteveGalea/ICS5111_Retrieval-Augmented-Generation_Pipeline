{"summary": "multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assays have improved diagnostic sensitivity for a wide range of pathogens. however, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. a commercial multiplex real-time PCR assay includes 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. XLS 311kb contains names, labels, and coding for individual variables."}
