{"summary": "studies examining associations of TNF and lymphotoxin- (LTA) single nucleotide polymorphisms with severe sepsis have produced conflicting results. the aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variation in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B was associated with susceptibility to or death from severe sepsis in Chinese population. individuals with AA+AG genotypes had significantly higher TNF- serum concentrations than those with GG genotype (Padj = 0.02) however, there were no significant associations between SNPs in the four candidate genes and 30 day mortality for patients with severe sepsis. rs1800629 (TNF 308) and rs909253 (LTA +252) have been the focus of many investigations on sepsis. TNFR2 influences the biological activity of TNF- and LT- both in a membrane-bound and. TNFR2 facilitates activation of nuclear factor (NF)-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades upon binding with TNF- and LT-. soluble TNFR2 is capable of binding and inactivating circulating TNF- and LT-. TNFR2 mediated protective effects in the development of severe sepsis [31] a total of 432 severe sepsis patients, 384 sepsis patients and 624 health volunteers were enrolled in this case-control study. the average age and proportion of male among the severe sepsis, sepsis and healthy control groups did not show significant difference. chronic renal failure N.A 14 (3.6%) 18 (4.2%) 0.70 12 (4.3%) 6 (3.8%) 0.80 Congestive heart failure N.A 22 (5.7%) 28 (6.5%) 0.66 18 (6.5%) 10 (6.4%) 0.96 Chronic pulmonary disease N.A 28 (7.3%) 37 (8.6%) 0.50 22 (8.0%) 15 (9.6%) 0.56 SOFA score N.A 1.40.3 8.21.6 0.001 6.91.8 10.51.9 0.011 Failing organs (s rs1800629 (308G/A), located in promoter region of TNF, was associated with significantly increased risk for severe sepsis. rs1800629 (308G/A), located in promoter region of TNF, was associated with significantly increased risk for severe sepsis. 29A in severe sepsis patients was significantly higher than that in both the healthy control subjects (P = 0.00028, OR = 2.08) and the sepsis patients (P = 0.00035, OR = 2.39), and the difference remained significant after Bonferroni correction. the difference of the allele and genotype frequencies of rs1800629 between subjects with sepsis and healthy controls was not statistically significant (P>0.05). rs1800630 (863) promoter C/A 0.39 rs1799964 (1031) promoter T/C 0.49 LTA (TNF-) rs909253 (+252) intron A/G 0.58 TNFRSF1A rs767455 (A36G) exon A/G 0.22 rs4149570 (G609T) 5\u2032UTR G/T 0.72 TNFRSF1B rs1061622 ( 810 (94.6%) T 48 (4%) 42 (5.6%) 46 (5.4%) rs1799724 0.21 1.18 (0.98\u20132.01) 0.52 1.06 (0.86\u20131.46) 0.12 0.85 GG 444 (73.6%) 263 (70.3%) 285 (67.9%) GA 149 (24.7%) 107 (28.6%) 130 (31%) AA 10 (1.7%) 4 (1.1%) 5 (1.2%) G 1037 (86%) 633 (84.6%) 700 (83.3%) A 87 (52.3%) 461 (55.4%) G 576 (48.1%) 353 (47.7%) 371 (44.6%) TNFRSF1A rs767455 0.16 1.20 (0.82\u20131.68) 0.72 1.04 (0.76\u20131.23) 0.27 0.76 AA 462 (76.4%) 276 (73.4%) 302 (71.4%) GA 131 (21.7%) 90 (23.9%) 112 (26.5%) GG 12 (2.0%) 10 (2.7%) 9 (2.1%) A 1055 232 (55.2%) AA 50 (8.2%) 23 (6.2%) 30 (7.2%) G 814 (66.8%) 506 (67.8%) 548 (65.2%) A 404 (33.2%) 240 (32.2%) 292 (34.8%) SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. 0.7%) G 291 (94.5%) 503 (92.1%) A 17 (5.5%) 43 (7.9%) rs361525 0.68 1.15 (0.59\u20131.98) 0.62 CC 135 (87.7%) 247 (90.1%) CT 19 (12.3%) 27 (9.9%) C 289 (93.8%) 521 (95.1%) T 19 (6.2%) 27 (9.9%) rs1799724 0.21 0.76 (0.49\u20131.21) 0.12 GG 109 (71.7%) rs1800629 genotypes were associated with higher levels of TNF- compared with GG genotype after LPS-stimulated condition.

PBMCs were derived by using Ficoll gradient density centrifugation method. multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. age, gender, history of diseases, source of infection and APACHE II scores were included in the multivariate models. 624 ethnic-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. the severe sepsis patients were those admitted to the emergency, Surgical and Respiratory ICU at Zhongshan Hospital. the sepsis patients were considered as at risk controls for severe sepsis. exclusion criteria included age below 18 years, pregnancy, severe chronic respiratory disease, severe chronic liver disease, malignancy, using of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and AIDS diagnosis. healthy controls were defined as individuals without any recent acute illness, chronic illness or history of sepsis and severe sepsis. four SNPs in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were selected and genotyped on the GenomeLab SNPstream high-throughput 12-plex genotyping platform. the primers for PCR and single base extension were performed with Beckman Coulter Autoprimer software and shown in Table S2. test for association with genotypes used the global genotype test. allele frequencies of cases and controls were used to calculate the OR and the 95% CI. the software used for statistical calculations was SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) unless specified. the software used for statistical calculations was SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)"}
