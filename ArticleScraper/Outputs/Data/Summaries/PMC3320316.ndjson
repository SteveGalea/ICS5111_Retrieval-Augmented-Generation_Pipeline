{"summary": "standardized telephone interviews were conducted with 1,755 confirmed SARS patients within 1 week of hospital admission. a close contact was defined as a person who cared for, lived with (in the same household) or came into direct contact with body fluids of the patients within 10 days before hospital admission. a total of 3,612 close contacts were recorded. ELISA detects antibody with IFA titer of >25 (i.e., sensitivity of 100%) and has a specificity of 95%. the reported sensitivity of 100% was for convalescent-phase serum samples taken a few weeks after onset of infection in SARS patients. the participants who consented to testing were broadly similar to those who declined, except that the first group had relatively fewer children and fewer of the first group were men. those who consented to testing were more likely to report more frequent contact and closer relationships with SARS patients, more febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February. 155 (14.6) 135 (19.3) No. of precautions adopted during SARS outbreakb 0.25 2 60 (6.6) 47 (8.6) 3\u20134 113 (12.4) 81 (14.8) 5\u20136 334 (36.7) 187 (34.1) 7\u20138 402 (44.2) 234 (42.6) No. of febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February 2003 0.02 0 643 (61.7) 471 (68.4) 1\u20132 351 (33.7) 193 (28.0) >3 ARS-CoV strains in Hong Kong almost always led to clinically apparent disease. almost all SARS patients had severe disease requiring inpatient treatment. we can infer that SARS-CoV inevitably caused severe disease requiring hospitalization. a survey of close contacts did not report a telephone number. they were mostly nonhousehold contacts who would have had less intense exposure to SARS patients. contacts who refused to participate (561) or refused to have serologic testing (708) might have done so because they were concerned about having had SARS. the participants who consented to testing were broadly similar to those who declined, except that the first group had relatively fewer children and fewer of the first group were men. but those who consented to testing were more likely to report more frequent contact and closer relationships with SARS patients, more febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February. no. of febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February 2003 0.02 0 643 (61.7) 471 (68.4) 1\u20132 351 (33.7) 193 (28.0) >3 48 (4.6) 25 (3.6) Presence of chronic medical conditions 0.10 Yes 270 (28.3) 149 (24.6) No 683 (71.7) 457 (75.4) close contacts indicates that the prevailing SARS-CoV strains in Hong Kong almost always led to clinically apparent disease. nearly all SARS patients (perhaps with very few exceptions in children [4]) had severe disease requiring inpatient treatment; thus, we can infer that infection with SARS-CoV inevitably caused severe disease requiring hospitalization. we can infer that infection with SARS-CoV inevitably caused severe disease requiring hospitalization. there is no reason to suspect close contacts had a systematically different serologic profile. there is no reason to suspect they had a systematically different serologic profile. contacts who refused to participate may have done so because they were concerned about having had SARS."}
