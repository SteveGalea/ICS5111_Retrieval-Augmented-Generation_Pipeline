{"summary": "HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. we identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. HCoV LRTD is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. METHODS Study Design We identified all HCT recipients and patients with HM with HCoV detected in clinical BAL samples from a previously reported cohort. we also compared HCT recipients with HCoV LRTD to previously reported cohorts of HCT recipients with LRTD caused by RSV, influenza virus, and PIV. HCoV LRTD was defined as HCoV detection in a BAL sample from a patient with signs of LRTD (eg cough, dyspnea) or new pulmonary infiltrates. all BAL specimens underwent broad diagnostic tests including conventional cultures for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses. only the first episode of HCoV LRTD per subject was used for outcome analyses. we also excluded 2 HCT recipients with a history of lung transplantation. RT-PCR was performed for HCoV on BAL samples, serum specimens, lung biopsy, and autopsy samples according to a previously published protocol. HCoV was identified from BAL specimens using the consensus HCoV assay. RT-PCR was performed using saved BAL samples as described previously. bacterial coinfection was defined as bacterial load of >103 colony-forming units per milliliter of BAL specimen with compatible radiological findings and clinical course. highest steroid doses in the 2 weeks prior to HCoV LRTD and cell counts most immediately prior to HCoV LRTD were recorded. the probability of overall mortality in HCT recipients by day 90 following the diagnosis of LRTD was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. the log-rank test was used to compare mortality curves among subgroups. 11 (48%) were identified as OC43, 5 (22%) as NL63, 4 (17%) as 229E, and 3 (13%) as HKU1. most episodes occurred in winter and spring regardless of strain type. patients with Hematologic Malignancy (n = 7) Respiratory symptomsb 34 (92) 27 (90) 7 (100) Abnormal lung examinationc 25 (68) 21 (70) 4 (57) Abnormal findings on chest imagingd 34 (92) 27 (90) 7 (100) HCoV strain OC43 11 (30) 10 (33) 1 (14) NL63 5 (14) 4 (13) 1 (14) 229E 4 (13) 0 HKU1 3 (11) 3 (10) 0 Un aTwo patients had separated LRTD episodes. the first patient developed LRTD 361 days and 415 days following hematopoietic cell transplant. the second patient developed LRTD 425 days before and 11 days after HCT. influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, human metapnuemovirus, NT, nontypeable strain due to unavailable sample; P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; PIV, parainfluenza virus; PJP, Pneumocystis jirovecii; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus only 1 sample (lung tissue) was positive for HCoV by RT-PCR. the bars indicate median values and first and third quartiles. compared between patients with and without respiratory copathogens. a total of 286 HCT recipients had a single respiratory virus identified in BAL samples for which comparable clinical data were available. a total of 286 HCT recipients with a single respiratory virus identified in BAL samples. mortality rates by day 90 following viral LRTD caused by HCoV, RSV, influenza virus, and PIV among HCT recipients without respiratory viral copathogens were not different. no difference was seen when the cohort was stratified by those with and without oxygen requirement at the time of LRTD diagnosis.

RT-PCR was performed on serum specimens, lung biopsy samples, and autopsy samples. the main limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size. further studies are needed to clarify if particular HCoV strains and viral load are correlated with clinical outcome. further studies are needed to clarify if particular HCoV strains and viral load are correlated with clinical outcome."}
