{"summary": "the entry step involves fusion of the viral and the cellular receptor membranes, which is mediated by the viral envelope (E) proteins. class I E proteins include influenza virus (IFV) hemagglutinin and retrovirus human immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) gp41; class II E proteins include a number of important human flavivirus pathogens. several hydrophobic peptides derived from the class II DENV and WNV E proteins exhibited potent inhibitory activities [16\u201320]. a potent peptide inhibitor derived from the domain III of JEV glycoprotein and a peptide inhibitor derived from the stem region of RVFV glycoprotein were reported [21, 22]. algorithm was employed to predict antiviral activities using physicochemical properties of general antiviral peptides. however, the mechanism of action of antiviral peptides is different from antimicrobial peptides. e.g. HIV-1 virus infection involves virus fusion, integration, reverse transcription and maturation, etc. non-active peptides comprised 75p+75n training set of SVM models. remaining 26 active peptides and 26 non-active peptides inhibitors were used as the test set. q a i i n a c t i v e is the probability of observing amino acid i in any peptide sequence, active or non-active. they are approximately estimated using the following forms: P ( q a i | C ) N o b s ( i, a ) N o b s ( i ) (2) P ( q a i ) N o b s ( if the amino acid sequence of an active peptide inhibitor is: DCPNGPWVWVPAFCQAVGWG, the statistical N values of the sequence would be: 2,2,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,3, 1,0,0,0,3,3,0. the results in the statistical function library based on the active peptide inhibitors are decided by Eq (1). 5-fold cross validation was performed to evaluate the performance of SVM models. the results were averaged over all five rounds of validation. data collection 202 peptide virus entry inhibitors of enveloped viruses were collected. acid composition Amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid in a peptide. the fraction of the 20 amino acids was calculated using the following equation: Fraction of amino acid X = Total number of X / peptide length Physicochemical properties. q a i i n a c t i v e is the probability of observing amino acid i in any peptide sequence, active or non-active. they are approximately estimated using the following forms: P ( q a i | C ) N o b s ( i, a ) N o b s ( i ) (2) P ( q a i ) N o b s ( if the amino acid sequence of an active peptide inhibitor is: DCPNGPWVWVPAFCQAVGWG, the statistical N values of the sequence would be: -0.0856, 0.5057, 0.4740, 0.4133, -0.0856, -0.0856, 0.6439, 0.2508, 0.2508, 0.8603, 0.330, 0.2261, -0.0115, 0.2761, 0.3288, 0.0479, -0.0115, 0, 0, 0, - peptides derived from E proteins bind competitively to their partner proteins, disrupt the forming of a-trimer-of-hairpin, and therefore inhibit the virus membrane fusion. the sequence-based scoring function is described in the following form: S ( q a i ) = ln P ( q a i ) is the probability of observing amino acid i in any peptide sequence, active or non-active. 20 columns of input are generated, corresponding to the occurrence of twenty natural amino acids at each position. each column is assigned a value of N * (log\u2013likelihood) where N is the number of amino acids and log\u2013likelihood is derived from the statistical function score. each of the features thus combines the propensity of the amino acid for being active or non-active with the corresponding amino acid composition. the default value is 1 for -c and 1/k for -g, where k is the number of input entries. 5-fold cross validation was performed to evaluate the performance of SVM models. the results were averaged over all five rounds of validation. SVM trains a dataset of experimentally validated positive and negative samples and generates a classifier to classify unknown samples into two distinct categories (positive or negative) 202 peptides were found, among them 101 are active peptides and 101 are non-active peptides.
