{"summary": "neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect children and young adults. the autosomal recessive juvenile form (JNCL), commonly known as Batten disease, is the most prevalent, presenting in roughly 1 in every 100,000 live births worldwide. gene augmentation for the treatment of the retinal degenerative disorder has been highly successful. a single subretinal injection of AAV2 (serotype 2) was shown to be well tolerated and sufficient to induce prolonged protein expression in humans. improvement in visual acuity, pupillary light reflex, visual fields and ambulatory vision was detected as early as 2 weeks postinjection. clinical-grade AAV2 virus carrying full-length CLN3 was generated in an FDA-registered facility using current good manufacturing practices. delivery of full-length CLN3 via adeno-associated viral vector restored full-length CLN3 transcript and protein to patient-specific fibroblasts. 395 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM)- (Cat.
