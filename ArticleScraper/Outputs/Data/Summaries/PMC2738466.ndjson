{"summary": "randomly selected 6,345 of the parish\u2019s 10,181 census blocks. the eliminated blocks were likely to be sparsely populated or to contain industrial buildings, commercial centers, or parks. a survey team navigated to a waypoint and identified the nearest home. each interview included an evaluation of respirator donning. interviewers were trained before the survey on proper donning. a participant with an N95 FF respirator appeared to be in good condition was permitted to use it. participants with at least 1 of the other donning errors were categorized as improperly donning the respirator. the remaining participants were categorized as properly donning the respirator. a survey team navigated to a waypoint and identified the nearest home. residents encountered at their own homes who were employed as remediators were not excluded. if unable to conduct an interview at the first encountered home, the team proceeded in a systematic manner to the next home. each interview included an evaluation of respirator donning. properly donned disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator. to be properly donned, the respirator must be correctly oriented on the face and held in position with both straps. for persons with long hair, the lower strap should be placed under the hair. most described previously using a mask or respirator, but few reported ever having a respirator fit test. most had participated in mold clean-up activities since hurricane Katrina. n/N (%) 372/551 (68) No. of homes cleaned (N = 368), median, range 2, 1\u201350 No. with mold extent 50% (N = 367), median, range 1, 0\u201325 Still participating in clean-up activities. participants could select >1 racial category; total >100%. 538 (97%) participants agreed to put on an N95 FF respirator. most of these (n = 489, 91%) used 1 of the 2 models offered by the interviewers. FF respirator were noted to have at least 1 donning error. more than half of these did not tighten the nose clip, and half incorrectly placed the 2 straps. 22% put the respirator on upside down, and 21% used only 1 strap. 129 (24%) of participants properly donned the N95 FF respirator. proper donning was associated with several personal factors. being male, being Caucasian, and being a nonrenter. ed certified respirator at interview 44 19 3.48 (2.23\u20135.43) 0.001 Participated in clean-up (N = 363) Used mask or respirator during clean-up 31 16 2.42 (1.15\u20135.74) 0.02 Used a mask or respirator during clean-up 35 22 2.02 (1.27\u20133.25) 0.01 Workplace source of mask or respirator 48 29 2.22 (1.00\u20134.95) 0.05 Workplace source of information 47 28 2.29 (1.24\u20134.23) 0.01 * proper donning was not associated with age, Hispanic ethnicity, level of floodwater, water incursion due to roof or window damage, extent of mold coverage, current employment in mold remediation, asthma diagnosis, smoking status, or respirator brand. participants We conducted 553 interviews at the 600 visited waypoints. half of the participants were male, with a median age of 50 years. about half identified their race as Caucasian and half as African-American or black. most had participated in mold clean-up activities since hurricane Katrina. 179/550 (33) Do not know 15/550 (33) Employed in mold remediation, n/N (%) 45/553 (8) Ever had respirator fit test, n/N (%) 80/543 (15) Activities in water-damaged/moldy home since Katrina Been inside, n/N (%) 467/551 (85) Participated in clean-up, n/N (%) 372/551 (68) No. of homes cleaned (N = 368) experience n/N (%) used mask or respirator 315/368 (86) Type of mask or respirator used Noncertified mask (dust or surgical) 143/315 (45) Certified respirator, type 233/315 (74) Disposable N95 filtering facepiece 192/233 (82) Reusable half-face with cartridges 87/233 (37) Reusable full-face with cartridges 4/233 (2) Source of mask or respirator Store 207/315 (66) Nongovernmental organization 433 (80%) of participants who donned an N95 FF respirator were noted to have at least 1 donning error that could contribute to a poor fit. more than half did not tighten the nose clip, and half incorrectly placed the 2 straps. the only noted donning error was a visible gap (n = 6) or facial hair (n = 18). 129 (24%) of participants properly donned the N95 FF respirator. proper donning was associated with several personal factors. 0.001 Ever had respirator fit test 58 18 6.10 (3.69\u201310.21) 0.001 Been inside water-damaged/moldy home (N = 536) 26 14 2.11 (1.12\u20134.35) 0.02 Participated in clean-up (N = 536) 29 14 2.58 (1.60\u20134.31) 0.001 Confirmed certified respirator at interview 44 19 3.48 (2.23\u20135.43) 0.001 Participated in clean-up (N = 363) Used mask or 367 of 372 who participated in clean-up donned an N95 FF respirator for the interviewer. male, Caucasian, ever had respirator fit test, had mask or respirator at time of interview, and used disposable N95 FF respirator during clean-up. proper donning was associated with use of respiratory protection during clean-up. subset used a certified respirator during clean-up (OR 5.17; 95% CI, 2.75\u201310.24); having had a respirator fit test (OR 3.38; 95% CI, 1.75\u20136.61); being Caucasian (OR 3.38, 95% CI, 1.97\u20135.91); and being male (OR 2.80; 95% CI, 1.58\u20135.13). despite this high level of motivation, most participants did not properly don an N95 FF respirator study of 18 different N95 FF respirator models found 74% of proper donnings would provide the full protection possible with an N95 FF respirator (range 31%\u201399%, depending on the model) the proportion of participants who achieved the full protection possible with an N95 FF respirator is likely to be lower than the proportion who demonstrated proper donning. study of 62 healthcare workers in 3 California hospitals found 40 (65%) improperly put on N95 FF respirators before entering the room of a patient in isolation for tuberculosis. errors included use of only 1 strap, incorrectly placed straps, and presence of facial hair (21) survey of nonoccupational respirator use found a minority of participants demonstrated proper donning of an N95 FF respirator. findings are of particular importance to public health agencies planning for future events, from floods to pandemic influenza."}
