{"summary": "URECA study was designed to test effects of urban environmental and lifestyle factors on immune development and the risk of asthma. entry criteria included residence in one of 4 urban areas (Boston, Baltimore, New York, and St. Louis) at least 20% of the population had incomes below the poverty line, as well as self-reported allergies or asthma. scores of 5 were assigned for wheezing, retractions, tachypnea, or cyanosis. parents were advised to call the study center when respiratory symptoms were noted. a second sample of nasal mucus was collected in the home or clinic. 80 URECA families were selected for calls every 2 weeks. the estimated rates of illness and infection were compared to those obtained for the entire cohort receiving telephone-based reminders every 6 weeks. a new multiplex PCR method for analyzing respiratory viruses was developed for the URECA study. in the URECA data only, Spearman correlations and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the association between number of illnesses reported on the quarterly questionnaires and certain environmental exposures and characteristics. logistic regression models were used to test whether the proportion of viruses detected differed by level of illness severity. the COAST study was approved by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Human Subjects Committee, and informed consent was obtained before enrollment. entry criteria included residence in one of 4 urban areas in which at least 20% of the population had income below the poverty line. parents were counseled to call the study center when respiratory symptoms were noted. scores of 5 were deemed to signify a moderate or severe illness. a second sample of nasal mucus was collected in the home or clinic. a substudy was conducted in 2007\u2013January 2008, when the children were 1\u20132 years of age. 80 URECA families were selected for calls every 2 weeks, during which questions were asked about respiratory illnesses. the estimated rates of illness and infection obtained were compared to those obtained for the entire cohort receiving telephone-based reminders every 6 weeks. RESULTS Demographic Characteristics of Study Populations At 12 Months of Age Characteristic URECA Cohort (n = 515) COAST Cohort (n = 285) P Mother's age, mean SD 24.4 5.9 31.4 4.8.001 Mother's education level. URECA and other children in the home, no., median (IQR) 1 (0\u20132) 1 (0\u20131).001 Data are % of study participants, unless otherwise indicated. rates of respiratory illnesses in the URECA study depended on the method. estimates of the frequency of respiratory illness in the main URECA cohort were also specified by the caretakers on quarterly questionnaires. the estimate of illness frequency in the frequently called group was comparable to those based on parental recall and recorded on quarterly questionnaires for the rest of the URECA cohort during the same period. the rate of virus detection increased with the severity of illness (P.001; Figure 2). HRVs alone were detected most often (in 24.1% samples [71 of 295]), followed by multiple respiratory viruses (in 18.0% [53 of 295]). virus only 2.7 2.6 1.00 Influenza virus only 1.4 2.6.33 Bocavirus only 1.0 0.2.11 Enterovirus only 1.7 1.2.55 2 viruses 18.0 25.3.02 Any virus 67.5 89.2.001. graphs include data from 656 specimens from URECA participants and 823 from COAST participants. these results were essentially unchanged when we restricted the analysis to URECA children born at 36 weeks of gestation. in contrast to HRV and RSV infections, adenovirus infections were found more frequently in the URECA study, compared with the COAST study. this was true for adenoviruses detected as the sole pathogen (4.3% of cases [28 of 656] vs 1.1% [9 of 823]; P.001) adenoviruses in both studies belonged to group C. there were no significant associations between adenovirus infections and demographic characteristics, breast-feeding, number of other children in the home, day care attendance, income, presence of eczema, allergen-specific IgE levels, or environmental exposure to allergens. 65 5.001 Breast-fed at birth 57 91.001 Attends day care for >10 h/wk 47 46.750 Other Children in the home, no., median (IQR) 1 (0\u20132) 1 (0\u20131).001 Data are % of study participants, unless otherwise indicated. estimates of the frequency of respiratory illness in the main URECA cohort were also specified by the caretakers on quarterly questionnaires. the estimate of illness frequency in the frequently called group was comparable to those based on parental recall and recorded on quarterly questionnaires. viruses were detected in 67.5% of samples (199 of 295) from URECA children with symptom scores of 5. the rate of virus detection increased with the severity of illness. HRV detection rates were highest among children with mild illnesses. adenovirus only 4.8 0.7.001 Parainfluenza virus only 4.4 6.1.35 Coronavirus only 3.4 4.9.39 Metapneumovirus only 2.7 2.6 1.00 Influenza virus only 1.4 2.6.33 Bocavirus only 1.0 0.2.11 Enterovirus only 1.7 1.2.55 2 viruses 18.0 25.3.02 Any virus 67.5 89.2.001. adenovirus infections were found more frequently in the URECA study. this was true for adenoviruses detected as the sole pathogen. this was true for adenoviruses detected either alone or together with another virus in the same specimen. the majority of adenoviruses in both studies belonged to group C. the majority of adenoviruses in both studies belonged to group C. there were no significant associations between adenovirus infections and demographic characteristics, breast-feeding, number of other children in the home. infections with adenovirus, either alone or with other viruses, were significantly more common in the urban population. the rates of overall viral recovery were positively related to the severity of illness, but for each illness category, including asymptomatic infections, viral detection rates were lower in the urban infants. it is possible that more of the urban than suburban children were infected with undetected viruses. adenoviruses most frequently cause either respiratory symptoms, gastroenteritis, or keratoconjunctivitis. in hospital-based studies of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract illnesses, adenoviruses caused 7%\u201315% of illnesses. in 60%\u201380% of these illnesses adenovirus was detected with another virus. adenovirus infections are spread by aerosol droplets, and risk factors for transmission of infection among military recruits include crowded conditions and smoking. in the URECA population, it is interesting that the highest rates of adenovirus infections were found in the participants from new york city. the URECA cohort focuses on urban children of low socioeconomic status who have high rates of respiratory morbidity in early life and of asthma in childhood. the cohort focuses on urban children of low socioeconomic status who have high rates of respiratory morbidity in early life and of asthma in childhood.
