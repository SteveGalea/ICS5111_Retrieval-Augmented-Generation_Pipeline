{"summary": "COPD is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. this is primarily caused by tobacco smoking, but there is gathering evidence that additional factors predispose patients to COPD. there may well be a genetic predisposition and also some food preservatives have also been implicated. spirometry is believed to correlate poorly with symptoms [17], quality of life [18], exacerbation frequency [19] and exercise intolerance [20]. a more recent and comprehensive method for assessing disease severity and prognosis of COPD is the BODE Index. a comparison between the BODE and GOLD classifications shows that the BODE is a better predictor of hospitalisation [22] and death [21] than by GOLD. spirometry measures the end result of what may be a number of disease processes. it is known that patients vary considerably in their response to treatments. it is possible that there are a number of pathways by which smoking leads to the final state of COPD. an alternative diagnostic approach may help identify disease subtypes. gene expression Several researchers have examined gene expression profiles in an attempt to identify biomarkers, distinguish disease sub-types and generate candidates for further genetic and biological studies. the authors have presented the first gene expression biomarker for COPD validated in an independent data set [45] the non-overlapping gene datasets from these studies are due to several factors, including differences in sample acquisition, disease severity, sample size, tissue and cell components, and expression platforms. a larger scale analysis of proteins in COPD has been undertaken using two different techniques. a recent genome-wide linkage analysis identified a region on chromosome 1p that showed strong evidence of linkage to lung function traits. a recent genome-wide linkage analysis performed by Hersh et al identified a region on chromosome 1p that showed strong evidence of linkage to lung function traits [36]. emphysema subjects were identified as a gene over-expressed in emphysema subjects by Zhang et al [46]. a combined microarray/SAGE approach validated Egr-1 induction associated with COPD severity. the authors have presented the first gene expression biomarker for COPD validated in an independent data set. pinto-Plata et al investigated 406 proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage. these proteins showed expression patterns that were both up- and down-regulated. this highlighted 24 proteins, which were up-regulated in disease. but it was acknowledged by the authors that the study was a proof of principle rather than a comprehensive analysis. potential COPD biomarkers also implicated in References Clara cell protein-10/16 Cystic fibrosis, general lung injury, lung cancer [51,70,71] C-Reactive Protein Lung cancer, asthma [50,72,73] Endothelin-1 Asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, heart disease [53,74] IFN-gamma Pulmonary sarcoidosis, viral infections [54,75,76 systems biology is a broad new paradigm that has recently entered the terminology of the life and biomedical sciences arena. it combines data from all these fields with bioinformatic, computational biology and engineering principles to examine organisms as systems of interconnecting networks. traditional '-omics' fields, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics examine only one strand of the information available about an organism. studies have started to apply systems biology approaches and principles to decipher pathways underlying diseases including Alzheimer's disease [124], polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [125], psychiatric disorders [126] and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [127]. Currently, our understanding of systems biology is reaching a point where patterns of molecular behaviour are far clearer indicators of pathophysiological conditions than individual molecular markers. a disease-specific molecular fingerprint would be a dynamic model that could be adapted to include such targets as new evidence becomes available of their involvement in COPD. multi-parametric technologies, including bead-based assays, 2D gel electrophoresis, microarray platforms and mass spectrometry, have provided the opportunities for a more holistic approach not previously possible. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) polaritons are electromagnetic waves that propagate in a direction parallel to the interface between the metal and the external medium. this phenomenon enables the label-free, real-time detection of the interaction of biological molecules to the metal surface (usually gold) polaritons are surface electromagnetic waves that propagate in a direction parallel to the interface between the metal and the external medium. the use of SPR-based detection modalities is that they are label-free and therefore do not require anything more for their identification apart from selective recognition on an appropriate chip surface. this flexibility coupled with the potential for increased sensitivity has led to an upsurge in the use of SPR technology. Cho et al used SPR detection of CSFV antibodies to identify pigs infected with classical swine fever [191] Cho et al devised an SPR assay for detection of the candidate pancreatic cancer marker activated cell leukocyte adhesion molecule (ALCAM) the measurements made during the latter two studies were demonstrated to have comparative specificity and sensitivity to those undertaken with classical detection techniques. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) polaritons are surface electromagnetic waves that propagate in a direction parallel to the interface between the metal and the external medium. this phenomenon enables the label-free, real-time detection of the interaction of biological molecules to the metal surface (usually gold) biomolecules within the sample bind to ligands immobilised on the gold surface. this change enables determination of both kinetic and analyte concentrations. the use of SPR-based detection modalities is that they are label-free. several studies have used SPR to detect biomarkers at clinically relevant concentrations. for example, Nagel et al have been able to differentiate Lyme borreliosis patients from healthy donors by SPR analysis of CSFV antibodies in blood serum samples [188] Cho et al used SPR detection of CSFV antibodies to identify pigs infected with classical swine fever [191] oglobin [170,186] osteoporosis N-telopeptide

\u2013 Implementation of a working COPD specific microarray chip. a small blood sample would be required, which would be separated into serum and both mRNA and protein species of a molecule will be examined even if only one of these has been associated with disease. mRNA and protein levels of a molecule will be examined even if only one of these has been associated with disease. the proposed use of whole blood as a sample would require steps for separation on the basis of size and the ability to lyse cells to extract intracellular components. this could be achieved by coupling a microfluidic system such as that previously described [209] to the chip to allow in-situ separation of the blood sample into plasma and cellular components. some major challenges with its implementation need to be overcome. protein microarray platform to identify 24 serum proteins that were up-regulated in COPD [50] while Shaker et al demonstrated that down regulation, as well as up-regulation, of plasma proteins was indicative of COPD [48]. fibronectin and CRP are significantly associated with all-cause mortality of COPD patients [52]. an observed biomolecular pattern from a suspected COPD patient is compared to a standardized 'healthy' pattern. this approach is much more powerful than a diagnosis based on the presence of an altered concentration of a singular molecular marker. the holistic measurement of a biomolecular pattern is more likely to reflect a disease condition than an individual molecular marker. mRNA and protein levels of a molecule will be examined even if only one of these has been associated with disease. mRNA and protein species of a molecule will be examined even if only one of these has been associated with disease. using blood samples would provide the opportunity to examine a full spectrum of molecular and cellular components within the disease-specific fingerprint. the proposed use of whole blood as a sample would require steps for separation on the basis of size and the ability to lyse cells to extract intracellular components. this could be achieved by coupling a microfluidic system to allow in-situ separation of the blood sample into plasma and cellular components. graft versus host disease [217], chronic pancreatitis [198], brain cancer [218], lung cancer [219,220] and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [221]. preliminary evidence that patterns of biomarkers in the peripheral compartment could be used to distinguish patients with COPD. implementing advanced detection modalities is to include analytical protocols that are able to recognise complex biomolecular patterns made up of different molecular species. the challenge is to determine the hidden (i.e., disease) parameters from the observable molecular data so that the target condition of COPD can be identified. the approach is particularly helpful with determination of the probability that any 'positive' result is actually a false positive. analysis of biomolecular patterns would provide information on the molecular and cellular basis underlying the onset of COPD in an individual. it would provide a means by which the health of a COPD patient could be efficiently monitored. early symptoms of COPD are chronic cough and sputum production. spirometric testing will be undertaken, by which time irreversible damage will have occurred. it is necessary to find ways in which to diagnose COPD when it is at a stage that is treatable and when smoking cessation will have an effect on prognosis. monitoring such individuals should facilitate significant improvements in early disease detection allowing enhanced drug intervention. authors' contributions JLR and RAU mainly wrote the manuscript, as well as the revision, and contributed equally to the
