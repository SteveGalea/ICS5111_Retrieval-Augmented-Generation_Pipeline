{"summary": "the traditional Chinese medicine Gancao (licorice root) is the dried roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch (licorice), G. inflata Bat., or G. glabra L. Gancao. the traditional use of Gancao involves a decoction of dried plant roots and stems. GA (Figure 1) and glycyrrhetinic acid (Figure 2) are well-characterized components of Gancao. GA can generate glycyrrhetinic acid through metabolic processes in the human body. the pharmacological effects of GA are the same as glycyrrhetinic acid. -GA is derived from -GA by isomerization, and the - and -forms differ only in their C18\u2013H\u2013, trans-, and cis-configuration. some scholars examined their distribution characteristics in rat tissue and found that the concentrations of -GA in the liver and duodenum were significantly higher than those of -GA after i.v. administration. however, the concentrations of -GA in the other tissues were significantly higher than those of acute onset autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) Fever, general malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant discomfort Recovery rate was higher in the SNMC group than in the SNMC + CS group (P = 0.035) Glycyrrhizin 200 mg, i.v., q.d., 52 weeks None 374/129 Chronic hepatitis C Inflammatory effect The proportion of patients with ALT reduction 50% the 10-year HCC appearance rates in histologic Stages I, II, and III were 3%, and 13%, respectively Other herbal medicines None [24] Glycyrrhizin 200 mg + NaCl 100 mL, i.v., q.d., 0.1\u201314.5 years None 1249/796 Interferon-resistant hepatitis C Chronic hepatitis effect Crude carcinogenesis rates in the treated and untreated group were 13.3%, TBil, ALT, AST, HA, and IVC are significantly ameliorated in treatment group (P 0.01) -glycyrrhizic acid Edema, blood pressure increased, and serum potassium mildly low [27] Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate 80 mg + 10% glucose injection liquid 250 mL, i.v., q.d., 4 weeks None 60/30 Chronic severe hepatitis B Fatigue GA has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects via suppression of TNF- and caspase-3. the anti-inflammatory activity of GA may rely on the inhibition of release of TNF-, myeloperoxidase activity, and translocation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) into the cytoplasm. glycyrrhizin compound chemotherapy inhibits hepatic fibrosis. hepatic lymphocytes inhibit the cascade leading to apoptosis. glycyrrhizin tablet Improving liver dysfunction augmented entire cytotoxic function mediated by hepatic lymphocytes. tic acid Antiviral anti-inflammatory Regulating the expression of inflammation-related factors. resistance to biologic oxidation and membranous protection neuroprotective effect. GA suppressed interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF- production induced by lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharides. transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT-3) reduce the upregulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and P-selectin expression. reduce formation of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) (PAR) and nitrotyrosine. GA inhibited the lytic pathway of the complement system and may prevent tissue injury caused by the membrane attack complex. GA can increase hepatic glutathione levels by the inhibition of biliary excretion of glutathione partly through the inhibition of MRP2 [53], an efflux transporter located at the canalicular membrane of a hepatocyte. GA can activate certain immune functions, such as IFN production, augmentation of NK cell activity. BD-1 production of EKs mediated via the suppressor molecules CCL-2 and IL-10 affects T cell dysfunction. GA regulates the burn-associated type 2 T cell responses to recover IL-12 and make it unresponsive. this restores the impaired cells. san nanoparticles (CMCNP) modified by GA with various substitution degrees can efficiently deliver paclitaxel (PTX) to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), which resulted in remarkably enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor efficacy. a case report showed that combined administration of GA and cilostazol caused pseudoaldosteronism [89]. hepatic apoptosis and necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) is an important cytokine, which is a key mediator of hepatic apoptosis and necrosis in hepatitis. plasma TNF- level is also elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis caused by hepatitis B viral [35] and acute alcoholic hepatitis [36]. GA can be effective chemopreventive agent against lead acetate mediated hepatic oxidative stress in rats because it binds lead. in concanavalin A- induced mouse model, GA alleviated conA-induced inflammation and fibrosis progression in livers via inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to ConA via the Jun N-terminal kinase. antiviral anti-inflammatory Regulating expression of inflammation-related factors. resistance to biologic oxidation and membranous protection neuroprotective effect. GA suppressed interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF- production induced by the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharides. GA can prevent the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT-3), reduce the upregulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and P-selectin expression, reduce formation of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) and nitrotyrosine, and reduce polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. GA inhibited the lytic pathway of the complement system and may prevent tissue injury caused by GA can increase hepatic glutathione levels by the inhibition of biliary excretion of glutathione partly through the inhibition of MRP2 [53]. treatment could significantly reduce blood immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-6), NO, TNF- levels, and nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) activity dose-dependently. cells exercise an inhibitory effect on MBD-1 production of EKs mediated via the suppressor molecules CCL-2 and IL-10. GA regulates the burn-associated type 2 T cell responses to recover IL-12 and make it unresponsive. this restores the impaired cells, thus restoring the impaired cells. -carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles (CMCNP) modified by GA with various substitution degrees can efficiently deliver paclitaxel (PTX) to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) this significantly facilitated the increased accumulation of PTX in hepatic tumor tissues and the targeted delivery of PTX to hepatoma carcinoma cells. GA treatment may inhibit the occurrence of HCC. GA is effective in combating hyperglycemia and associated pathological complications such as hyperlipidemia, abnormal histoarchitectures of different organs, and oxidative stress. the effects of GA on diabetes-associated changes are almost comparable with those of glibenclamide, a standard antihyperglycemic drug, suggesting a possible use of the herbal agent. GA improves resistance to C. albicans infection by inducing CD4+ T cells. regulation of neutrophil-associated M2M generation by GA may provide a new therapeutic strategy. drugs that include GA have been on the market for years. GA combined with matrine GA can improve liver fibrosis effectively. this is evidenced by lower levels of collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin (LN), less hepatic stellate cells (HSC) proliferation, collagen I, and HA levels secreted by HSC in vitro. glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the activity of mammalian polymerases, including pol. glycyrrhetinic acid also reduced TNF- production and NF-B activation and suppressed mouse ear inflammation stimulated by tissue plasminogen activator. studies indicate that GA could modulate various molecular pathways in liver disease. there are numerous patents for drugs including GA. there are numerous patents for drugs including glycyrrhizic acid. application of glycyrrhizic acid, glycyrrhetinic acid, or salt thereof as well as gel composition and preparation method for gel composition CN102614213 Aqueous pharmaceutical solutions with trisubstituted glycyrrhizic acid salts EP1226831 A1 Aspergillus niger bacterial strain and glycyrrhizic acid used for production thereof CN101255401 B Berber powder for livestock and preparation method CN102526082 B Dispersed compound tablet of glycyrrhizic acid and its salt and its preparing method CN100386086 C Enteric-coated formulation of glycyrrhizic acid and its salt and its preparing method CN1274309 C Film-coated tablet of glycyrrhizic acid monopotassium salt and method for preparing the same CN100341515 C rhizic acid sustained release drops pills and preparation method thereof CN101269020 A Glycyrrhizic acid transdermal formulation and preparation technique thereof CN101433529 A Glycyrrhizic acid, biogastrone acid or its salt, derivative temperature sensing gel rubber, preparation method, and application thereof CN101292952 B Glycyrrhizin high concentration preparation US2006160754(A1) Glycyrrh for measuring paeoniflorin, hesperidin, and glycyrrhizic acid in stomach-nourishing granules CN103175915 A Method for producing glycyrrhizin sodium aliphatate or glycyrrhizin potassium aliphatate CN101830962 B Method for producing glycyrrhizic acid through enzymolysis CN102219824 glycyrrhizic acid CN103159809 A Preparation method of high-purity glycyrrhizic acid CN101759757 A Process for extracting purified glycyrrhizic acid from licorice residue CN1450081 A Process for producing glycyrrhizic acid CN102617694 A Products sweetened with alpha-glycosyl glycyrr use of glycyrrhetinic acid and/or glycyrrhizic acid for producing cosmetic preparations for tanning the skin US2009280074(A1) Use of glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizic acid, and related compounds for prevention and/or treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."}
