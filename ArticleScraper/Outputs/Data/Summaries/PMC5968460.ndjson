{"summary": "the extents of replicative infidelity vary among different RNA viruses. the purified picornaviral RdRPs generally demonstrate high levels of nucleotide misincorporation, especially in the case of transitions. however, such a level of enzyme infidelity is consistent with the acquisition of one mutation by each newly synthesized molecule of RNA of these viruses. the level of heterogeneity depends not only on the intrinsic fidelity of the viral RdRPs but also on the mode of genome replication (35). the latter implies that all the progeny genomes within a given cell are templated just by the infecting genome(s), whereas the latter posits that the newly synthesized genomes serve as templates. a single infectious dose in tissue cultures, e.g., a PFU of poliovirus, may contain as many as hundreds of virions. there is no reason to believe that such genomes constitute a majority, let alone the overwhelming one. the number of physical particles needed to avoid a fitness decrease due to a natural bottleneck is generally unknown. population heterogeneity includes viral variants that exhibit enhanced fitness if the population meets unfavorable conditions. polioviruses are highly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of millimolar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. the presence of drug-resistant and drug-dependent variants in largely sensitive populations has also been reported for other inhibitors. picornaviruses are small (roughly 30 nm in diameter), nonenveloped, icosahedral animal viruses which are classified into >35 genera, 80 species, and hundreds of types. they include pathogens causing important human and animal diseases, such as poliomyelitis, hepatitis A, common cold, myocarditis, encephalitis, foot-and-mouth disease. the genomes of some picornaviruses also have additional, relatively small overlapping ORFs (78\u201380) the proteins characteristic of this viral group are encoded in two separate ORFs, corresponding to P1 and P2-P3, respectively. also, the existence of a potential second ORF downstream of the entire main polyprotein-encoding sequence was reported. ification of picornaviruses, genome segmentation, was demonstrated experimentally. the polyprotein-encoding part of picornavirus genomes is flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR) containing key cis-elements that vary markedly in structure in different picornaviral genera. the functional and structural features of these elements vary tremendously among different picornavirus genera. an essential component of this complex is the viral RdRP (3Dpol), which is recruited there in the form of its precursor, 3CD. this interaction involves the hairpin domain d of oriL and the 3Cpro moiety of 3CD. the interaction between these ligands is important for the initiation of the synthesis of both the viral (positive) and complementary (negative) RNA strands. picornavirus oriRs are polyfunctional (122), being involved in negative RNA strand initiation (116, 119, 123), polyadenylation of the genomic RNA (124), and control of translation through (primarily but not only protein-mediated) interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR. the oriR structures of various enteroviruses are in part responsible for cell-specific fitness differences. the enteroviral 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR appear to interact with one another. the picornavirus genomes also contain an additional important replicative cis-element, cre (cis-acting replicative element) (136\u2013138) it folds into hairpin-containing structures (139, 140) that are located in different regions of the polyprotein ORF. the 3\u2032-terminal poly(A) tract is synthesized by using the 5\u2032-terminal poly(U) sequence in the negative viral RNA strands as the template. the poly(A) stretches may be markedly longer than the poly(U) ones (161, 162) eukaryotic cells possess two families of nucleotide deaminases. double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminases convert adenosine into inosine. eukaryotic cells possess two families of nucleotide deaminases. the effects of these multifunctional enzymes on RNA viruses should not be underappreciated. ionizing radiation and other environmental mutagenic factors should not be ignored. ionizing radiation and other environmental mutagenic factors should not be ignored. recombination occurs via template switches, whereby a working molecule of RdRP prematurely terminates its elongation; the newly synthesized, uncompleted chain lands on a new template to serve as the primer for continuation of the synthesis. recombination involves joining fragments originating from distinct viral (or cellular) RNA molecules without involvement of the viral RdRP. replicative and nonreplicative recombination can generate homologous (precise) and nonhomologous (imprecise) recombinants. the nonreplicative mechanism is expected to produce predominantly nonhomologous ones. there are different reasons for experiments with selection of viable viruses from pools of viral RNA with randomized segments. such experiments can reveal structural features required to ensure viability of the virus and affecting its fitness. randomization of larger genome segments can be regarded as just the replacement of a functional part of the genome with irrelevant (but not necessarily inactive [204] sequences. indels are less common in natural viral populations due to their removal by negative selection because of generally strong fitness-impairing effects. these effects may be due to various mechanisms, the most important being interruption (or shifting) of ORFs, destruction of important protein structures and RNA cis-acting elements, and limitation in the RNA genome length (174\u2013176) recombination occurs via template switches, whereby a working molecule of RdRP prematurely terminates its elongation. the newly synthesized, uncompleted chain departs from its template and lands on a new template. this is a generally accepted model (54, 181\u2013185), and most recently, it was supported by demonstration of the dependence of recombination frequency on the fidelity of the viral RdRP. gene truncation is usually accompanied by a more or less marked loss of fitness. losses of genome integrity are expected to occur often enough due to several mechanisms, such as antiviral nucleases and endoribonucleases. environmental factors, such as ionizing radiation and alkylating agents, may also lead to RNA genome disruption. a significant proportion of point mutations in the genomes of picornaviruses (7) and various other RNA viruses (205\u2013208) are detrimental. many nucleotide alterations are fitness neutral or exhibit relatively mild fitness defects. this ability to more or less tolerate genetic alterations may stem from different roots. some mutations in the TGK peptide of the oriL-interacting motif of 3Cpro do not exhibit appreciable phenotypic alterations. some mutations in the TGK peptide of the oriL-interacting motif of 3Cpro do not exhibit appreciable phenotypic changes, at least in in vitro experiments. oligonucleotide elements with different primary structures may be conserved. cis-element oriL of poliovirus RNA interacts with viral nonstructural protein 3CD. apical tetraloop and two adjacent base pairs of domain d of poliovirus oriL (52) investigated viable plaque-forming viruses could be occupied by any nucleotide. tetraloops able to fold stably into a YNMG-like spatial structure appeared to be well-accepted partners for their protein ligands. many experimentally introduced deletions in other parts of the untranslated regions of picornaviral genomes did not result in appreciable functional deficiencies. even the entire deletion of two conserved secondary structure domains of the IRES still did not kill the virus (246). otides were registered for the 5\u2032 UTRs (60) and 3\u2032 UTRs (274, 275) of closely related representatives of polioviruses and FMDV. if they are associated with some fitness cost, the detrimental phenotypic changes are likely to be suppressed by some second-site mutations. TMEV was not markedly affecting the capacity of the virus to grow in nonneural cells. this attenuating effect was due to decreased affinity of the mutated IRES for the neural form of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein. a mutation can be truly neutral within a certain genetic context but may confer an altered fitness within another context owing to epistasis. a DV variant that accumulated various debilitating mutations during multiple plaque-to-plaque passages represented another example of conversion of a lytic virus into a noncytocidal one (290). a negative selection resulting in the elimination of less-fit variants can be counteracted by either reversions or compensatory second-site mutations, owing again to the infidelity of viral RdRPs. the picornaviral 5\u2032 UTRs contain at least two important functional elements, involved in genome replication (oriL) and translation (IRES), which exhibit marked structural differences in different representatives of this family. they may be separated from each other as well as from the downstream ORF by spacers with various structures and lengths. a factor underlying this inequality is the proportion of time during which the element really adopts the conformation recognizable by its ligand. the fitness of viruses with relatively \u201cpoor\u201d YNMG-like folding was enhanced by mutational \u201cimprovements\u201d increasing the probability of adopting the necessary conformation (52). reversion of adverse point mutations in the picornavirus IRES was well illustrated by early studies on the instability of the attenuating mutations in the picornavirus IRES. in the guts of vaccinees, such reversions occur very often and quite rapidly at positions 480, 481, and 472 in the RNAs of OPV serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. this leads to restoration of their somewhat impaired secondary (for serotypes 1 and 3) or 98-G481 interaction (green) in the genome of the wild-type predecessor of the vaccine virus was replaced with U398-A481 (red) in the organisms of recipients of the vaccine. similar deattenuating effects could be achieved by second-site mutations (pseudoreversions) resulting in the restoration of the impaired secondary or tertiary IRES structure. poliovirus IRES (structural type I) exhibits remarkable plasticity in the response to debilitating indels. a tandem of an oligopyrimidine (Yn) and a cryptic AUG (located at positions 559 to 563 and 586 to 588, respectively, in the Mahoney strain of serotype 1) separated by the 22-nt spacer (171, 325\u2013327) poliovirus IRES has a functionally important tandem of an oligopyrimidine (Yn; green rectangle) and a cryptic (noninitiator) A586UG (green circle) with a spacer of 22 nt. deactivated cryptic AUG and spontaneously acquired functional cryptic AUGs are shown as yellow and purple circles. some mutants exhibited a ts phenotype, while others were quasi-infectious. their \u201crevival\u201d was due to one or two second-site point mutations in the case of one such mutant and to an 150-nt large deletion in the downstream region of the 5\u2032 UTR in the case of another. large insertions between Yn and the initiator AUG of the TMEV RNA resulted in a significant attenuation of virus neurovirulence for mice. a 4-nt insert at position 220 of the 5\u2032 UTR resulted in a small-plaque phenotype, but different large-plaque variants were selected after passages (244) complete or partial deletions of the picornaviral oriR may result in a marked suppression of genome replication at normal or supra-optimal temperatures. however, an 8-nt insert in the poliovirus 3\u2032 UTR resulted in ts viruses, from which ts+ revertants were selected. a 14-nt deletion of the structurally different oriR led to a quasi-infectious genome (135) interaction led to quasi-infectious genomes which, after a relatively long period of marginal replication, could increase their fitness through either a single-nucleotide insertion, allowing an alternative, sufficiently strong kissing, or unexpectedly, the complete loss of the X and Y domains. a significant fitness gain could be achieved by the spontaneous destruction (rather than repair) of oriR through the deletion of domains X and Y. polyadenylation was achieved by the terminal adenylyltransferase activity of the viral RdRP. it was demonstrated to exist in the viral RdRP of a related poliovirus. it also cannot be ruled out that poly(A) was supplied by a still-undefined cellular mechanism. in any case, the virus was able to survive even such a severe trauma. the picornaviral 5\u2032 UTRs contain at least two important functional elements, involved in genome replication (oriL) and translation (IRES), which exhibit marked structural differences in different representatives of this family. they may be separated from each other as well as from the downstream ORF by spacers with various structures and lengths. the fitness of viruses with relatively \u201cpoor\u201d YNMG-like folding was enhanced by mutational \u201cimprovements\u201d increasing the probability of adopting the necessary conformation (52). a strong, though not fatal, debilitation of poliovirus caused by inversion of the sequence of stem-loop b of oriL could be partially ameliorated by spontaneous acquisition of nucleotide substitutions in the loop. reversion of adverse point mutations in the picornavirus IRES was well illustrated by early studies on the instability of the attenuating mutations in the picornavirus IRES. in the organisms of vaccinees, such reversions occur very often and quite rapidly at positions 480, 481, and 472 in the RNAs of OPV serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. this leads to restoration of their somewhat impaired secondary (for serotypes 1 and 3) or wild polioviruses of serotype 1 contain a destabilizing mutation at position 480 (A to G) contributing to its attenuated phenotype, but this destabilization is not usually conserved in vaccinees. the strengthening of this base pairing might be accomplished not only by the reversion (G480A) but also by a compensating pseudoreversion (U525C) (311, 322). poliovirus IRES (structural type I) exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to debilitating indels. genomes with 23-nt or 39-nt inserts or 8-nt deletions in this spacer proved to be quasi-infectious (171, 172) fitness recovery of genomes with shortened spacers may be accomplished in three different ways. the poliovirus IRES has a functionally important tandem of an oligopyrimidine (Yn; green rectangle) and a cryptic (noninitiator) A586UG (green circle) with a spacer of 22 nt. the initiator A743UG is marked as a red circle. the reversions appeared host dependent, since the quasi-infectious genomes generated different sets of pseudorevertants in HeLa and neuroblastoma cells. the replacement at positions 585 to 592, destroying an RNA helical structure and the cryptic AUG codon, generated a large deletion resulting in creation of a tandem of Yn and the initiator AUG. the rehabilitative capacity of the IRES elements of structural type II was studied less extensively, but a 4-nt insert at position 220 of the 5\u2032 UTR of Sabin-1 poliovirus resulted in a small-plaque phenotype, but different large-plaque variants were selected after passages (244). a strong ts phenotype caused by a 4-nt deletion at the same locus could be ameliorated spontaneously by enlarging this deletion to 41 nt (336). poliovirus oriL can sustain various internal alterations without significant functional impairments. different apical tetraloops of domain d potentially able to acquire a YNMG-like conformation are compatible with viability, but they endow different levels of fitness. a strong, though not fatal, debilitation of poliovirus caused by inversion of the sequence of stem-loop b of oriL could be partially ameliorated. harmful alterations of domain d of oriL may lead to fitness-restoring amino acid replacements in an RNA-binding motif of protein 3Cpro. if the original debilitating mutation completely prevents the replicative ability, then there is obviously no possibility for rehabilitation. in the parental Mahoney strain, the structure is partly stabilized by pairing between nt A480 and U525 (marked in green) while it is partially destabilized in Sabin-1 by the A480G substitution (red), contributing to the attenuation of neurovirulence. the strengthening of this base pairing might be accomplished by the reversion (G480A) but also by a compensating pseudoreversion (U525C), which also resulted in a similar increase in virulence (323) and in vitro translation efficiency (311). poliovirus IRES (structural type I) exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to debilitating indels. poliovirus genomes with 23-nt or 39-nt inserts or 8-nt deletions in this spacer proved to be quasi-infectious (171, 172) fitness recovery of genomes with shortened spacers may be accomplished in three different ways: acquisition of an insert (e.g., 9 nt); generation of a new, functional cryptic AUG downstream of the original cryptic AUG. deactivated cryptic AUG and spontaneously acquired functional cryptic AUGs are shown as yellow and purple circles. mutagenesis was used to generate 14 octanucleotide replacements in different loci of the poliovirus IRES (246) some mutants exhibited a ts phenotype, while others were quasi-infectious. destabilization of one of the helices of the IRES of EMCV could be compensated at least partially by acquisition of the true reversion or second-site mutations. the increased fitness of some pseudorevertants of this mutant could be ascribed to alterations outside the IRES. another kind of compensatory mutation concerns the above-mentioned A637C replacement in the TMEV IRES (286) the oriL and IRES in various picornaviruses may be separated by conserved spacer sequences with poorly defined functions. their alterations might also lead to adverse fitness effects, which may be ameliorated by second-site mutations. a 4-nt insert at position 220 of the 5\u2032 UTR resulted in a small-plaque phenotype, but different large-plaque variants were selected. oriR requires a tertiary (kissing) interaction between its X and Y domains. alteration of 4 nt in the loop of domain X destroyed this interaction. a significant fitness gain could be achieved by the spontaneous destruction (rather than repair) of oriR through the deletion of domains X and Y. the genome of a virus recovered after transfection with the 3\u2032 UTR-lacking RNA terminated with UAGUCGAn. it is possible that the polyadenylation was accomplished by the terminal adenylyltransferase activity of the viral RdRP, which was demonstrated to exist in a related poliovirus. in any case, the virus was able to survive even such a severe trauma. uaa cellular polyadenylation signal could be involved in the initial polyadenylation of the engineered genome. the origin of this segment is unknown, but it may come from a cellular RNA, e.g., the casein kinase II mRNA, by recombination (replicative or nonreplicative) after further passages, the additional fitness gain was followed by further transformation of the genome. a mutation in an RNA cis-element is compensated by alteration of its protein ligand. an even stronger fitness-increasing effect resulted from natural acquisition of a combination of this mutation with a mutation at another 3\u2032 UTR position (135). disruption of certain single base pairs in the kissing interaction of the coxsackievirus A-9 (CAV9) oriR may kill the virus (119), whereas more extensive destabilization of this interaction led to quasi- the genome of a virus recovered after transfection was terminated with ORF-N111-UCGAAU13AAUAAAAn. the genome of the virus recovered after transfection was terminated with ORF-N111-UCGAAU13AAUAAAAn. it is possible that poly(A) was accomplished by the terminal adenylyltransferase activity of the viral RdRP, which was demonstrated to exist in the viral poliovirus. the origin of this segment is unknown, but it possibly came from a cellular RNA, e.g., the casein kinase II mRNA, by recombination. after further passages, the additional fitness gain was accompanied by further transformation of the genome. reappearance of the poly(A) sequence in the engineered tailless genome of hepatitis A virus (having an entirely different oriR structure) was also reported. no intermediates with only some of the reversions could be detected on previous days. the genome of the revertant lacked a number of 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides (i.e., part of oriL) which were lost before the complete set of reversions had been acquired. reversion of a debilitating mutation in the poliovirus 3AB protein was described by de la Torre et al. (359) no intermediate genomes possessing only some of these synonymous mutations were detected, to some extent mimicking the above-described collective reversion in the cre element. a poliovirus with a 3-nt insert close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the 3Cpro coding sequence was detected. a 12-nt insert in the 2C coding region of poliovirus RNA resulted in the acquisition of a ts phenotype. a pseudorevertant able to grow efficiently at the supra-optimal temperature was shown to have two second-site substitutions in 2C. pseudorevertant exhibiting temperature dependence similar to that of the wild-type virus. its 2C coding sequence contained the two mutations present in the cold-sensitive variant and an additional second-site amino acid change, strongly suggesting that it originated from the intermediate cold-sensitive virus. however, many adverse amino acid alterations and short indels in poliovirus proteins appear to be readily curable by using different rehabilitation mechanisms. similar results were obtained after insertion of the luciferase gene at the same position of the RNA (370) the loss was usually imprecise, resulting in distinct partial deletions suggestive of nonhomologous recombination events. more or less similar results were obtained in other studies as well. genome segmentation may represent a mechanism for fitness recovery after genome damages. replacements of genomic regions, which may occur through recombination, are usually regarded as an evolutionary tool for adapting to new or unfavorable viruses. a poliovirus with the entire IRES exchanged for its counterpart from human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) exhibited a strong ts phenotype, rendering them highly inefficient at 37\u00b0C in neural (and murine) cells. the chimera proved to be highly attenuated with respect to neurovirulence. the capacity of the mutant to grow in neural cells was severely impaired. however, genetic determination of the phenotypic properties of these chimeric viruses was more complex. it indicates the existence of a complex network of functional interactions (epistasis) between different parts of the viral genome, i.e., the IRES, oriR, and several nonstructural proteins. a chimera in which the capsid-encoding part (P1) of CAV20 was replaced by its poliovirus analog proved to be quasi-infectious. the combination of these two mutations restored the fitness to a nearly wild-type level. the defect in the original chimera was traced to impaired encapsidation of the viral RNA, strongly supporting the role of the VP3-2A interaction in this process (402). cleolytic cleavage or incomplete copying is not infrequent during viral reproduction. RNA fragments that are large enough may serve as recombination partners to help the recovery of the disrupted viral genomes. ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog which suppresses a variety of RNA (and DNA) viruses. resistance was due to a significant increase in the fidelity of the mutated polymerase, which became more reluctant to use the inhibitor as a substrate. a particular FU-resistant mutant encoded an RdRP with a point mutation able to counteract the acquisition of just these transitions without markedly changing the mutant spectrum complexity in the viral progeny. mutation in the RdRP was also resistant to amiloride (410) the latter drug is not mutagenic but rather affects the intracellular ionic environment. it can be concluded that mutations altering RdRP fidelity may also modify some other properties of this enzyme. the above-mentioned guanidine-resistant mutants are a typical example. mutants may originate from quasispecies population with sequences different from the master (prevalent) one. the same point mutation in FMDV 2C confers resistance to guanidine (68) but also to ribavirin, ameliorating the mutagenic effect of the latter (425) a low fitness of one of the victims of this ratchet was associated with several point mutations scattered over the genome as well as with a significant extension of a penta-adenylate in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein ORF (428). the internal An stretch of the genome was invariably corrected either by true reversion to the original A5, by its shortening, or by an extended deletion of 69 nt that included it. the fidelity of alphavirus replication is also modulated by mutations in the helicase/protease (nsP2) (434) the Nidovirales exhibit a capacity for correcting replicative nucleotide misincorporation that is apparently unique among RNA viruses. a decrease in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus fidelity due to inactivation of this exoribonuclease wasaccompanied by a significant loss of viral fitness (441) intact RNAs 1 and 2, the altered RNA3 was regenerated by recombination (447) the genome of a potyvirus (a potyvirus) with engineered insertions of either its own genes (duplication) or foreign genes (pseudogenization) demonstrated either severe debilitation or even apparent death. passages of these low-fit mutants resulted in a more or less rapid enhancement of their reproductive (and competitive) capacity due to the removal of the different molecular mechanisms are operative in nonpicornaviral RNA viruses. different pathways for rehabilitation after adverse modifications of the 5\u2032 UTR were demonstrated for a chimera of VEEV with Sindbis virus (453) the 3\u2032 end of the viral negative RNA strand has a terminal unpaired dinucleotide. the repair of the damaged genomes may again involve different mechanisms, including RNA recombination, the use of the viral RdRP- or host-dependent polyadenylation activities. disruption of some such interactions resulted in a fitness loss, which could be restored at least partially by spontaneous reversions. -tRNA-like ends are terminated with the 3\u2032-CCCOH sequence. this trinucleotide and adjacent sequences are important for efficient genome replication. if modified or even absent, they may be spontaneously restored (479\u2013482) the error rate (487) and frequency of intermolecular recombination of viruses with double-stranded RNA genomes are relatively low due to peculiarities of their replicative machinery. this mutant was missing 36 nt in the RNA segment coding for the NS1 protein and exhibited ts and small-plaque phenotypes. gene of human respiratory syncytial virus (a pneumovirus) rendered the virus highly temperature sensitive (507) however, passages of its different lineages at stepwise increasing temperatures resulted in the selection of multiple, less-debilitated variants with mutations in various other viral proteins. the most significant compensatory effects were traced to each of the alternative amino acid changes in the viral M2-1 antiterminator protein. a decrease in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus fidelity due to inactivation of this exoribonuclease was accompanied by a significant loss of viral fitness (441) recombination frequency varies as well, being relatively high in nidoviruses (442\u2013445) and rather low in flaviviruses (185, 446). inactivating indels in the replicase gene of phage Q could be repaired by homologous recombination. in RNA viruses with non-IRES-dependent initiation mechanisms, recovery from significant translational defects may be based on different paths. a special case of mutational robustness was recently discovered in nidoviruses (452). the 3\u2032 end of the viral negative RNA strand has a terminal unpaired dinucleotide and adjoining hairpin with a short C/G-rich stem. mutations in two nonstructural VEEV proteins were also observed after a detrimental deletion of two stem-loops of another cis-acting replicative element located not far from the beginning of the ORF (454) the repair of the damaged genomes may again involve different mechanisms, including RNA recombination, the use of the viral RdRP- or host-dependent polyadenylation activities. disruption of some such interactions resulted in a fitness loss, which could be restored at least partially by spontaneous reversions. the damaged 3\u2032 terminus of a genomic segment may be repaired by making use of another segment as the recombination partner or as the template for the initiation of the complement of the defective segment. viable viruses with a marked variety of structures of the relevant stem-loop were selected (484) fidelity of replication of viruses with negative-strand RNA genomes appears to be comparable to that of positive-strand viruses. mutant was missing 36 nt in the RNA segment coding for the NS1 protein. mutations in another viral protein, phosphoprotein, and interferon-sensitive members of the quasispecies resulted in the selection of multiple, less-debilitated variants. RNA viruses are able to maintain their identity under constant conditions. replication errors are unlikely to increase fitness of well-adapted viruses but have a much higher chance of being advantageous for weak ones. instability opens opportunities for a debilitated virus to regain a wild-type-like genome. cross-species transmission appears to be a major factor of evolution of RNA viruses. to run ahead, it is sometimes useful to stumble. robustness can be defined as the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbation. in apparent contradiction with this fact, various alterations in these elements were reported to be lethal (52, 119, 121, 136, 341, 511, 512). this discrepancy may represent a manifestation of a significant rule formulated by the author Ilya Il'f. the fixation of the achieved results is done by selection, which is one of the key factors contributing to the conservation and evolvability of RNA genomes. this problem is closely related to the emergence/reemergence of pathogenic viruses, which has recently become a hot topic."}
