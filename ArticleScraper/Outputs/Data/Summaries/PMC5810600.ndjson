{"summary": "the risk of concomitant bacterial infection in febrile infants positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is unknown. of 10 964 febrile infants identified, 4037 (37%) had RVPCR. human rhinovirus (HRV) detection may indicate a lower risk of bacterial infection in febrile infants. it is unknown whether human rhinovirus (HRV) detection may indicate a lower risk of bacterial infection. infants who were evaluated between august 21, 2007 and august 20, 2016 after the institution of respiratory viral testing by multiplex PCR (RVPCR), were included. data collected included demographics and results of the evaluation for infection, including respiratory viral testing and bacterial cultures. in 2012, respiratory testing by using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT) was introduced at the Intermountain Central Laboratory by using the Luminex xTAG infants who had no bacterial cultures on initial evaluation and no subsequent positive culture results within 72 hours were considered negative for bacterial infection. culture results from 24 hours before through 72 hours after the febrile infant evaluation were included. the absolute frequency of infection in our cohort is indicated for each group, with the 95% CIs shown. a vertical line is drawn at a frequency of 10% as a reference. we compared infants with any non-HRV respiratory virus detected by multiplex PCR. the Enterprise Data Warehouse is shared across all facilities. infants who were evaluated at an Intermountain Healthcare facility were identified by using a previously validated algorithm. we excluded infants who were evaluated exclusively as outpatients because these infants infrequently underwent respiratory testing by PCR (15%; data not shown) the electronic medical records of all infants were managed for 72 hours after their initial evaluation to ensure there were no bacterial infections identified during subsequent evaluations. overall, 80.3% of infants in the baseline cohort had at least 1 bacterial culture performed. organisms present at 10 000 to 49 999 colony-forming units per milliliter were considered equivocal. skin flora (coagulase-negative Staphylococci, viridans streptococci, Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., or Propionibacterium spp.) were considered contaminants. we calculated relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all infants 1 to 90 days old as well as stratified by age (1\u201328 days old and 29\u201390 days old) the majority (72%) of infants were 29 to 90 days old. unknownb 413 (10.2) 1373 (19.8) Known 3624 (89.8) 5554 (80.2) Distribution of Known Ethnicity. infants with RVPCR were more likely to be admitted within 24 hours of presentation. a respiratory virus was higher among those tested by RVPCR compared with conventional methods. infants 29 to 90 days old had a significantly higher rate of respiratory virus detection than infants 1 to 28 days old (424 of 1091; 39%; P.001). HRV was the most common virus detected (1525 of 4037; 38%), and HRV was detected alone in 1392 (35%) infants. a higher proportion of infants 29 to 90 days old (1226 of 2946; 42%) were HRV-positive when compared with infants 1 to 28 days old. infants 29\u201390 d, n = 2946 n (%) RR (95% CI) n (%) RR (95% CI) n (%) RR (95% CI) n (%) RR (95% CI) All non-HRV virus\u2013positive 30 (3.7); 30 of 820 0.27 (0.19\u20130.39) 6 (4.4) 0.32 (0.15\u20130.71) 24 (3.5) 0.35 (0.24\u20130.51) HRV-positive only 21 (1.5 there were no infants 1 to 28 days old with a non-HRV virus detected with IBI, compared with 6.1% of those with no virus detected and 2.1% of infants with HRV. no infant 1 to 28 days old with any respiratory virus detected had bacterial meningitis. the majority of cases of meningitis (10 of 12; 83%) occurred in infants who were negative for respiratory viruses by RVPCR. infants 29 to 90 days old had a significantly higher rate of respiratory virus detection than infants 1 to 28 days old (424 of 1091; 39%; P.001). neumovirus 72 (1.8) 8 (0.7) 64 (2.2) influenza A 175 (4.3) 26 (2.4) 149 (5.1) influenza B 21 (0.5) 3 (0.3) 18 (0.6) high for infants with HRV detected alone (3.5% vs 7.5%; RR 2.12; 95% CI 1.43\u20133.15) and >3.5 times as high for infants who were negative by RVPCR (3.5% vs 13%; RR 3.66; 95% CI 2.53\u20135.31) TABLE 3. Frequency of Bacterial Infection by Type, Age, and Respiratory Virus Status. there were no infants 1 to 28 days old with a non-HRV virus detected. the detection of neither non-HRV nor HRV viruses was associated with a statistically lower risk of UTI. HRV detection in this age group was associated with a statistically decreased risk of IBI. the risk of BSI alone was lower when HRV was detected, but it was not statistically different. no infant 1 to 28 days old with any respiratory virus detected had bacterial meningitis. a number of studies have shown that respiratory virus detection is common in young children, particularly infants 1 to 90 days old. 55% of infants were positive for 1 or more respiratory viruses, and 38% had HRV detected. the decreased risk of bacterial infection in febrile infants with viral infections has been well documented. previous studies have shown a decreased risk of bacterial infection with both RSV and influenza virus as well as systemic EV. study demonstrates that the risk of bacterial infection remains markedly decreased with a PCR-based detection of respiratory viruses other than HRV. the duration of detection by PCR is 2 weeks. studies have shown that 50% of HRV detections are associated with symptoms. no infant 1 to 28 days old with a non-HRV virus detected had a BSI or IBI. this was not as large a decrease as that seen in infants with non-HRV viruses detected. a small proportion (2%) of infants included in this study were infected or colonized with respiratory EVs. none of the well-appearing study infants had clinical evidence of infection with EVs. more infants in the RVPCR group were admitted to the hospital within 24 hours of presentation. HRV is smaller than that seen with other respiratory viruses. it is possible that well-appearing infants 29 to 90 days old could be managed expectantly."}
