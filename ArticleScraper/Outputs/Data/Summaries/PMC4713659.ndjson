{"summary": "ischemia of osseous tissue could result in ischemic necrosis in bones. ischemia of osseous tissue was characterized by the damage in a single main blood vessel. circulating blood cannot satisfy the need of osteocytes, myeloid tissues were damaged and necrosis appears in osteocytes. 71 males, 42 females, and mean age 42.311.5 in Chinese Han population were collected from Lianyungang Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine. all the cases conformed to the diagnostic criteria of ONFH put forward by Mont et al. 116 controls (66 males, 50 females, mean age 40.111.3) were all healthy people visiting the same hospital and were comparable with the cases in age and gender. the written informed consent was obtained from each subject. initial denaturation 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 35 cycles of denaturation 94\u00b0C for 40 s, annealing 52\u00b0C for 1 min, extension 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C extension for 7 min. PCR products were digested by EcoO109I and Dpn II, respectively. arthralgia accompanied with knee pains in the main sites including groin, hip and thigh; limited internal rotation of the hip joint; histories of hip injury, corticosteroid use, alcoholism and diving. CT results reveal unequal-sized saccate photic zones with obscure margins and high-density sclerotic bones in the femoral head; irregular deformations of fracture and collapse of the femoral head. PCR-RFLP technology was adopted to distinguish the genotypes of ABCB1 C1236T and C3435T polymorphisms. initial denaturation 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing 54\u00b0C for 1 min, extension 72\u00b0C for 7 min. PCR products were digested by EcoO109I and Dpn II. the digested products were detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. control group (49.6%) suggested that T allele could inhibit the onset of ONFH (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.42-0.87) however, there was no relationship of C1236T polymorphism with ONFH susceptibility. TT genotype of C3435T showed strongly protective effects on the occurrence of ONFH (OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.15-0.75) TT genotype of C3435T showed strongly protective effects on the occurrence of ONFH (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.42-0.87) 1236T CC 27 (23.9) 25 (21.6) - - 1.000 CT 53 (46.9) 60 (51.7) 0.359 0.549 0.82 (0.42-1.58) TT 33 (29.2) 31 (26.7) 0.001 0.969 0.99 (0.47-2.05) C 107 (47.3) 110 (47.4) - - 1.000 T 119 (52.7) 122 (52.6) 0.000 0.988 1.00 (0.70-1.45) C3435T the incidence of ONFH is increasing year by year and the ONFH patients incline to the young man. it is urgent to find out high-risk population of ONFH, which will contribute to early diagnosis and timely treatment for the patients. TT genotype and T allele of C3435T seemed to be inhibitors for ONFH. TT genotype and T-T haplotype also a protective factor for ONFH."}
