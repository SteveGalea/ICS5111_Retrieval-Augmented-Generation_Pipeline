{"summary": "the overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%), followed by IBV (37.6%), ART (2.6%), and ILT (0.4%). in case of sonali, the seropositive percentage of all four pathogens was found higher in sonali than broiler. poultry industry is an important subsector of agriculture, has generated huge employment opportunity, increased the supply of good quality protein, ensured food security, involved in country\u2019s economic growth and reduced poverty level. there are several constraints that hinder the development process in poultry sector; among them, disease is the major one. ILT virus, an important virus, causes respiratory infection in birds belonging to the family Herpesviridae. mainly affects chickens and characterizes by sneezing, nasal discharge, swollen infraorbital, and nasal sinuses and sometime affects eye leads to conjunctivitis. 460 blood samples were collected from broiler and sonali chickens in four different districts. for broiler samples, six upazilas were selected. a total of 360 blood samples comprising 60 from six farms of each upazilas were collected. serum samples were diluted at 1:50 dilution in dilution buffer. final dilution of 1:500 was used as working samples for respective ELISA kits. 100 l of negative and positive controls was added into antibody coated plate wells. the optical density value of each sample was measured at 405 nm within 15 min after adding stop solution. the results were recorded by calculating sample to positive (S/P) ratio and antibody titer. all the sonali blood samples (100) were collected from ten farms of each upazila. each farm shared 10 samples. all the selected broiler and sonali farms had a history of respiratory problems. wells of microtiter plate were filled with substrate and incubated for 15 min at 22\u00b0C\u201327\u00b0C in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT. after incubation, contents of wells were aspirated and washed four times with wash buffer (350 l) the plate was then inverted and tapped firmly on absorbent paper to remove the moisture. 460 serum samples collected from broiler and sonali were tested against three viruses and one bacterium using indirect ELISA. overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%) and lowest in ILT (0.4%) viruses. no broiler samples were found positive for ART and ILT viruses. p value 0.000 0.038 0.007 0.000 ART = avian rhainotracheitis, ORT = Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, ILT = infectious laryngotracheitis, IBV = infectious bronchitis virus. seropositive percentages regarding age groups were as similar as types of birds mentioned in Table 1. the highest seropositive of ORT was observed in jamalpur. no broiler serum samples of all six study upazilas were found positive for ART and ILT viruses. the difference of ORT and IBV based on location was found statistically significant. inotracheitis, ORT = Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, ILT = infectious laryngotracheitis, IBV = infectious bronchitis virus. overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%) and lowest in ILT (0.4%) viruses. seropositive percentages regarding age groups were as similar as types of birds mentioned in Table 1. in case of broiler age was ranged from 3 to 4 weeks, sonali age was varied from 5 to 40 weeks. seropositive percentages regarding age groups were as similar as types of birds mentioned in Table 1. no broiler serum samples of all six study upazilas were found positive for ART and ILT viruses. in case of sonali, they were found to be seropositive for all the tested respiratory diseases with highest seroprevalence in IBV (60%). overall seropositive percentage of ART, ORT, ILT, and IBV viruses was 2.6%, 45.9%, 0.4%, and 37.6%, respectively. no samples were found positive against ART virus in case of broiler but 12% were recorded in sonali birds. comparatively higher or lower seropositivity of ORT in broiler was reported in different parts of the world. differences may be due to variation in geo-climatic condition, age and exposure of weather which might contribute to variable prevalence of respiratory diseases in birds. the seropositive of ORT in broiler and sonali was higher in later age. similar findings were also observed in some other studies of different parts of the world.
