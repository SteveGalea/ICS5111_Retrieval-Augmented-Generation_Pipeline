{"summary": "four human coronaviruses are currently known to infect the respiratory tract. human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) and the recently identified human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) OC43 (HCoV-OC43; group 2) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E; group 1) were identified in the 1960s. they are responsible for 10\u201330% of all common colds. infections occur mainly during winter and early spring. HCoV-NL63 is a new group 1 coronavirus, most closely related to HCoV-229E and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus [16]. the virus was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands in April 1988. 236 samples were collected from January to June 2003. 73 samples were recovered during the first trimester of 2004. a single HCoV-229E positive sample was isolated in April 2003. PCR-products were run on a polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide. followed by 50 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94\u00b0C; 30 sec at 48\u00b0C; 1 min at 72\u00b0C) a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in a thermal cycler. RT-PCR assays for HCoV-NL63 Samples that were found positive for HCoV-NL63 were confirmed using one-step RT-PCR assays. amplification of a 314-bp gene fragment in the nucleocapsid region was performed with two specific HCoV-NL63 primers. a 237-bp fragment in ORF1b was amplified using the primers repSZ-1 and repSZ-3 nested PCR was performed using 10 l of RNA-extract and 48\u00b0C annealing temperature. nested reaction mix was composed of 1 unit Taq polymerase, 1 l of a 25 mM dNTP-mix, 10 l 5X buffer C (PCR Optimizer Kit, Invitrogen, The Netherlands) and 30 pmol of forward and reverse primer in a 50 l reaction volume. the amplicons Chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with Chromas 2.2 (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Helensvale, Australia) the obtained consensus sequences were compared with the prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank database release 142.0 using BLAST analysis (NCBI BLAST server) annealing conditions during the RT-PCR assay were modified. the temperature was set at 55\u00b0C. isolates originated from bronchoalveolar lavages, pharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and sputum samples. a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene was amplified using the following primer set: Cor-FW (5'-ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC-3') and Cor-RV (5'-TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA-3') these one-step RT-PCR assays were undertaken in a 50 l reaction volume containing 10 L RNA-extract, 10 l 5x QIAGEN oneStep RT- the coordinates of Cor-FW and Cor-RV are 14017 and 14248, respectively, in the HCoV-NL63 complete genome sequence. RT-PCR assays for HCoV-NL63 Samples that were found positive for HCoV-NL63 were confirmed using one-step RT-PCR assays. amplification of a 314-bp gene fragment in the nucleocapsid region was performed. a 237-bp fragment in ORF1b was amplified using the primers repSZ-1 and repSZ-3 described by van der Hoek and colleagues. a third RT-PCR assay was carried out on the HCoV-NL63 positive samples amplifying a 839-bp fragment with ORF1a specific primers. amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. RT-PCR assays for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were deposited in the GenBank sequence database. positive results were confirmed by one-step RT-PCR using HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E specific primer pairs located in the membrane glycoprotein region. the annealing temperature was set at 55\u00b0C. sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA copies per l nasopharyngeal aspirate. sensitivity for HCoV-NL63 was a bit lower i.e. 5 103 RNA copies per l nasopharyngeal aspirate. a total of 244 samples were found negative for RSV by diagnostic testing. the 279 patients in this study comprise of 211 patients aged 2 years (75.6%), 68 aged 2\u201316 years (24.4%). one positive sample was collected at the end of January 2003 and coinfection with RSV type B was present.

HCoV-NL63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in February 2002, and in two oropharyngeal aspirates from December 2003 and January 2004, respectively. both HCoV-NL63 complete genome sequences show only 89% sequence identity in this spike insert region. the partial S gene sequences cluster together with the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences in two different groups. this confirms that the HCoV-NL63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are cocirculating. further research of complete genome sequences of these isolates is required. there are no data concerning cross-neutralization between HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. in theory, such cross-neutralization might be possible, since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1. the development of a pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay using a primer set that matches all known coronaviruses might be useful for the identification of new coronaviruses. LVDH, KP and BB developed the HCoV-NL63 RT-PCRs. all authors contributed to the final version of the manuscript, read and approved it."}
