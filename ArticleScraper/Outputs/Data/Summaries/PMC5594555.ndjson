{"summary": "the gene family is composed of CEA-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and secreted pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) the reason why PSGs exist only in a minority of mammals is still unknown. maternal ligands of PSGs may exist selective challenges by two distinct pathogens. rapid expansion of PSGs in certain bat species suggests that bat PSGs could be part of a pathogen defense system by serving as decoy receptors and/or regulators of feto-maternal interactions."}
