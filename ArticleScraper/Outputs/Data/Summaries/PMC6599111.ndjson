{"summary": "Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is classified in the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family. it is a small non-enveloped single-stranded circular DNA virus with approximately 2030 base pairs (bp) ambisense genome. the genome of PiCV contains at least two major open reading frames (ORFs) the YPDS is currently the biggest health issue in pigeon breeding. the global spreading of PiCV infections in pigeon population is probably due to pigeon racing and intercontinental trade. the aim of this study was to answer a question if subclinically infected with PiCV pigeons would develop a similar immune response to that developed by the uninfected birds. the study was carried out in strict accordance with the Act of 21 January 2005 on animal experimentation. mixed equal volumes of the adjuvant and PBS (400 L in total) were used as a vaccination control. three naturally infected pigeons were tested in order to select birds infected with a separate genotype of pigeon circovirus than the isolate used to produce PiCV rCP. pigeons were also screened for pigeon herpesvirus, pigeon adenovirus, salmonella spp., and endoparasites. each group of pigeons was housed in a separate unit. mononuclear cells isolated from spleen samples were divided into two parts. one part was used for determination of anti-PiCV rCP antibodies with ELISA. the second part was used for RNA extraction to evaluate the expression of genes encoding CD4 and CD8 T cells surface receptors. the multiScreen plates were coated with 100L/ well of a PBS solution of PiCV rCP (conc. 20g/ 1 mL) after incubation, 100 L of streptavidin, alkaline phosphatase (S-AP) were added to each well. the wells of Nunc-Immuno Module plates were coated with 100 L of PiCV rCP. the rabbit anti-pigeon IgG (dilution 1:30 000; Antibodies-online, USA) were used as primary antibodies. each rinsing step was performed with an ELx 405 automatic washer (Biotek, USA) disposable eight-channel DG8 cartridge (Bio-Rad, USA) was preloaded in a DG8 cartridge holder. the bottom wells were filled with 70 L of droplet generation oil. the prepared droplet emulsions were loaded into a semi-skirted, PCR-clean 96-well plate. the plate was then heat-sealed with pierceable foil. the birds were euthanized by intravenous administration of pentobarbital sodium at 70 mg/1 kg BW. the cap sequence of the pigeon circovirus representing the most common in the world genotype A was selected for the production of the PiCV recombinant capsid protein. three naturally infected pigeons were tested in order to select birds infected with a separate genotype of pigeon circovirus than the isolate used to produce PiCV rCP. pigeons were also screened for pigeon herpesvirus, pigeon adenovirus, salmonella spp., and endoparasite. the birds were housed in isolated units in a PCL3 biosafety facility. each group of pigeons was housed in a separate unit. pigeons were divided into 4 groups, 30 birds each. mononuclear cells were isolated and divided into two parts. one part was used for determination of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells. the second part was used for RNA extraction to evaluate expression of genes encoding CD4 and CD8 T cells surface receptors and IFN- (0\u201346 dpv). cell concentrations and the percentage of viable cells were determined in the Vi-cell XR analyzer. the multiScreen plates were coated with 100L/ well of a PBS solution of PiCV rCP (conc. 20g/ 1 mL) the samples were seeded directly to the wells of previously coated with PiCV rCP plates. after rinsing, 100 L of streptavidin, alkaline phosphatase (S-AP) were added to each well. the rabbit anti-rabbit IgG with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as primary antibodies. each rinsing step was performed with an ELx 405 automatic washer. data were expressed as mean OD450 +/- standard deviation in each group. the prepared droplet emulsions were loaded into a semi-skirted, PCR-clean 96-well plate (Bio-Rad, USA) using a multichannel pipette. the plate was then heat-sealed with pierceable foil using a PX1 PCR plate sealer (Bio-Rad, USA) each sample was analyzed in duplicate. the expression of this gene was significantly higher in group C1 than in all other groups on 23 dpv (p = 0.01 to 0.03) on 39 dpv, the expression of this gene in group C was significantly lower than in group V1 (p = 0.00 and 0.01) pigeons were vaccinated with PiCV rCP. expression of CD8 gene was higher in uninfected and immunized with PiCV rCP pigeons. difference was not statistically significant in both groups of naturally infected pigeons. similar tendency was not observed in both groups of naturally infected pigeons. group V1 was the highest on 2 dpv (approx. 200.0 +/-53.0 per 1 x 106 cells) the anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC number was the highest on 23 dpv. in control groups, the anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC number was constant throughout the experiment. anti-PiCV rCP IgY The pigeons from all investigated groups had low OD450 values before the immunization (0.27 +/- 0.15 on average) the OD450 value in group V1 pigeons on 23 dpv reached 1.28+/- 0.91 and was significantly higher than in group C birds (p = 0.00) all pigeons from groups V1 and C1 were positive for PiCV genetic material throughout the experiment. the PiCV viral loads were the highest on the day of the first vaccination in the sera of pigeons from both naturally infected groups. 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00 00.00

uninfected and immunized pigeons. no similar trend was reported in pigeons naturally infected with PiCV. expression of IFN- gene was higher in pigeons from groups V1 and C1. expression of this gene was also higher in pigeons from groups V1 and C1. pigeons were vaccinated with PiCV rCP mixed with adjuvant (groups V and V1) or adjuvant only (groups C and C1) on day 0 and boosted on day 21. samples were collected from pigeons of all groups on days 2, 23, 39, and 46 after first vaccination. pigeons were vaccinated with PiCV rCP mixed with adjuvant (groups V and V1) or adjuvant only (groups C and C1) on day 0 and boosted on day 21. samples were collected from pigeons of all groups on days 2, 23, 39, and 46 after first vaccination (dpv) there was no presence of PiCV genetic material in the sera of pigeons from both uninfected groups. the samples are divided by vertical dotted yellow lines. the unbroken pink line is the threshold, above which there are positive droplets (blue) with PCR amplification. no significant differences were observed in the percentage of T CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the blood and spleens between immunized with PiCV rCP and unimmunized pigeons. in the immunized pigeons, the percentage of T CD4+ lymphocytes was not significantly higher than in the unimmunized control birds. this method could provide reliable results and can be used as alternative to flow cytometry. the differences between naturally infected and immunized pigeons were not statistically significant. in the case of CD4 gene expression, this trend was noted only on 39 and 46 dpv. in the case of CD4 gene expression, this trend was noted only on 39 and 46 dpv. in the case of CD4 gene expression, this trend was noted only on 39 and 46 dpv. the presence of PiCV genetic material in the sera of both naturally infected groups of pigeons confirms the viremia. it also confirms that the increased expression of CD8 and IFN - genes was due to the viral infection, and not to the vaccination. this data is in accordance with the results obtained by Ferrari et al. in-house ELISA showed that the level of anti- PiCV rCP IgY increased successively in both groups of vaccinated pigeons. but seroconversion was detected earlier in the uninfected birds (23 dpv) the slight increase of antibodies in both groups of birds naturally infected with PiCV may be related to the subclinical infection with this virus. CP indicates that the specific humoral immune response in asymptomatically infected with PiCV pigeons appears later than in the uninfected birds. this suggests the immunosuppressive effect of PiCV on humoral component of the immunity. the depletion of B lymphocytes was also described in the case of PCV2 infection. pigeons infected with the PiCV isolate representing a genotype homologous with the vaccine responded correctly to vaccination. pigeons infected with the PiCV isolate representing a genotype homologous with the vaccine responded correctly to vaccination. pigeons infected with the PiCV isolate representing a genotype homologous with the vaccine responded correctly to vaccination. pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein elicits the immune response in both naturally infected and uninfected pigeons. pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein elicits the immune response in both naturally infected and uninfected pigeons. the rate of immune response varies depending on PiCV infectious status. the isolate used as a vaccine is marked with red. the strains isolated from birds considered for the experiment are marked with purple. the birds infected with isolate PiCV_2T were selected for the experiment."}
