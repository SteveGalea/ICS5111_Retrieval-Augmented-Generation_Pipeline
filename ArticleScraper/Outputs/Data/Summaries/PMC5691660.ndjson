{"summary": "viruses and their hosts have been involved in an eternal battle of adaptation and counter-adaptation for RNA synthesis since far before the emergence of humans. viruses coevolved many pathways to transcribe their own genetic material, meanwhile avoiding counter-adaptation of the host. RNAs are less immunogenic compared to proteins. nascent RNAs play a major role in gene regulation by viruses. nascent RNAs also play a major role in gene regulation by viruses. RNAPII is a 550 kDa multi-subunit enzyme complex. these subunits are arranged in a claw-like manner. RNAPII is a 550 kDa multi-subunit enzyme complex. RNAPII begins transcribing RNA in its active center (yellow dot) some viruses encode endonucleases that can cleave RNAs. ssRNA viruses are subdivided into negative or positive sense single-stranded (ss or +ss) classes. transcription and mRNA synthesis occur in three stages: initiation, elongation and termination. mRNA is terminated and released from the elongation complex. mRNA synthesis is promoted by factors that recruit RNAP to promoter. local unwinding of the dsDNA by the Ssl2 helicase subunit of TFIIH delivers the template strand into the RNAPII active center and creates a DNA bubble downstream of the TATA box. the TFIIK kinase module of TFIIH will subsequently phosphorylate RNAPII on the Ser5 of its CTD repeats, facilitating promoter clearance. many de novo transcription initiation events by RdRp are known to generate abortive transcripts during the initiation phase of RNA synthesis. however, the function of this small RNA is yet unknown. the polymerase can now scan the template and locate the conserved gene start signal (10\u201313 nt) of the first gene. 5\u2032-terminal capping of eukaryotic mRNAs is probably the first co-transcriptional RNA processing event. eukaryotes and some DNA viruses (e.g., vaccinia virus) and dsRNA viruses (e.g., reovirus) obtain this cap by processing the 5\u2032-triphosphate end (pppN-) of nascent RNA transcripts into a diphosphate (ppN-) using an the eukaryotic mRNA cap consists of a 7-methylguanosine linked to the initiator nucleoside of mRNA through the 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. the methyl group at the N7 position of the guanosine is shaded gray; the methyl group at the N7 position of the guanosine is shaded gray; the conventional RNA capping pathway. RNA viruses have evolved capping mechanisms that are different from capping during cellular transcription. most +ssRNA viruses encode capping enzymes that selectively cap the newly synthesized viral mRNAs. nidoviruses and flaviviruses encode capping enzymes that selectively cap the newly synthesized viral mRNAs. influenza uses a virally encoded heterotrimeric RdRp called FluPol. each genome segment is circularized by the base-pairing of the near complementary 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. FluPol is tightly docked into the 5\u2032 end of the vRNA by a pocket formed between the PA and PB1 subunits. the PB2 cap-binding domain associates with the 5\u2032 end of the cellular mRNA. the PA endonuclease domain next cleaves the mRNA. this creates a capped 11\u201312 nt small RNA primer that is loaded into the active site of FluPol [62,63,64] elongation is the repeated addition of a nucleoside monophosphate to the 3\u2032 end of the growing RNA chain. these transcriptional pauses can be used to create a time window for co-transcriptional events such as splicing, nucleotide modification, or RNA processing. major transcriptional pauses typically occur within 20\u201360 nt after transcription initiation. ficiency virus type 1 trans-acting region (TAR) contains an RNA genome that is reverse transcribed into DNA upon entry of the host cell. the 5\u2032 located long terminal repeat will act as the viral promoter. the promoter region contains binding sites for NF-B [77,78], activator protein 1 (AP1) [80,81] and variable other TFs dependent on the HIV-1 subtype. RNAPII is paused until it is reactivated, which may include refolding into the most stable TAR configuration. RNAPII is paused until it is reactivated, which may include refolding into the most stable TAR configuration. Tat recruits P-TEFb by outcompeting 7SK snRNP in several ways. first, the TAR-binding Arginine-rich motif region of Tat shows high similarity to the 7SK-binding of 7SK snRNP component hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced protein 1 (HEXIM1) [96], and third, both Tat and HEXIM1 bind CycT1 in a mutually exclusive manner due to the shared Cy EBV is a human -herpesvirus that persists as a mini-chromosome in the nucleus of B lymphocytes. two long ncRNAs called EBER1 (167 nt) and EBER2 (173 nt) are expressed in infected cells at high levels (EBER1: 106 copies; EBER2: 2.5 105). EBER2 localizes in the vicinity of a binding site for the paired box protein 5 (PAX5) host transcription factor. this co-localization suggested that these factors collaborate in some way. this co-localization suggested that these factors collaborate in some way. mRNAs carrying short poly(A) tails (25 nt) are recognized and poly-uridylated by terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTases) 4 and 7, which labels the mRNA for degradation. many +ssRNA viruses lack a poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032 end of their genome, but are still efficiently translated. retroviruses have to produce an alternative transcript as a miRNA-source. most of these sub-genomic transcripts are RNAPIII-encoded [125,126], but can also result from transcription termination of promoter-proximal paused RNAPII [127]. this nascent RNA will subsequently be exported to the cytoplasm, where it can enter the RNAi pathway at the Dicer step. the PA-X protein-encoding gene overlaps with the open reading frame (ORF) for the PA FluPol subunit. fusion protein with the 191-aa N-terminal mRNA endonuclease domain of PA and an alternative C-terminal X domain of either 41 or 61 aa. RNAPII complex and spare ncRNAs transcribed by RNAPI and RNAPIII are unknown. the mechanisms that allow viral mRNAs to escape from XrnI cleavage are unknown. viruses use their own nascent RNA as a scaffold to recruit host transcription factors."}
