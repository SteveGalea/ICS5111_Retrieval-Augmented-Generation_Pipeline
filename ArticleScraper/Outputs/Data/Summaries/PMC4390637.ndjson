{"summary": "the spectrum of the illness of dengue ranges from mild dengue fever (DF) to severe and fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DSS) (2). there are at least four known antigenically distinct DENV serotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 (4). each serotype contains several phylogenetically distinct genotypes (5). the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was reported to take 20 min to perform and requires a constant temperature of only 37\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C. both the RPA and RT-RPA assays have been used for the detection of various other infectious agents (15\u201336), but they have not been implemented for the detection of DENV. 203 serum samples from 203 patients clinically suspected to be infected with DENV at the UMMC during the period from June to August 2013 were obtained for this study. the majority of the patients from this cohort were adults, and the median age of the patients was 29 years. exo probe was validated using viral RNA extracted from different reference DENV strains. RT-RPA was performed in a final reaction volume of 50 l containing a lyophilized pellet dissolved with 45 l of TwistAmp RT exo rehydration buffer and 5 l of the extracted RNA template. all of the enzyme levels were optimized for performance with dengue-specific oligonucleotides. the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) fluorescence of RT-RPA was generated via the endonuclease-mediated cleavage of the TwistAmp exo probe at the tetrahydrofuran abasic site mimic. the fluorescence signal was measured using a Twista real-time fluorometer (TwistDx, Ltd.) the threshold limit was the mean fluorescence intensity (mV) plus 3 standard deviation the japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) were isolated from human and mosquito. no record was available for the origin of the JEV. a probit analysis was performed to calculate the detection limit of the RT-RPA assay at a 95% probability level. a chi-square test (McNemar's exact test, two-tailed) was performed to compare the sensitivities of all molecular and serological methods used. a total of 203 serum samples from 203 patients clinically suspected to be infected with DENV at the UMMC during the period from June to August 2013 were obtained for this study. the majority of the patients from this cohort were adults, and the median age of the patients was 29 years (range, 3 to 79 years) the coverage of the RT-RPA primers and exo probe was validated by evaluating the assay using viral RNA extracted from different reference DENV strains. the RT-RPA was performed in a final reaction volume of 50 l containing a lyophilized pellet dissolved with 45 l of TwistAmp RT exo rehydration buffer and 5 l of the extracted RNA template. the RT-RPA reaction mixtures were incubated at 40\u00b0C for 20 min. the 6-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence of RT-RPA was generated via the endonuclease-mediated cleavage of the TwistAmp exo probe at the tetrahydrofuran abasic site mimic. the cross-reactivity of the DENV RT-RPA primers and exo probe was evaluated using the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Sindbis virus (SINV) the CHIKV and SINV were isolated from human and mosquito, respectively. no record was available for the origin of the JEV. RT-RPA, RT-LAMP, and qRT-PCR were considered false-positive tests. all of the statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21 (IBM Corporation, NY, USA) the detection limits of the RT-RPA assay were determined using a panel of serially diluted viral RNAs extracted from infected cell culture supernatants. the RT-RPA assay detected all of the replicates of up to 10 viral RNA copies for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. the detection limit of the RT-RPA assay at the 95% probability level was 11 DENV genome copies. no amplification of the japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or Sindbis virus (SINV) was observed. the performance of the RT-RPA assay was compared to that of the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays. negative (n = 107) RT-RPA positive (50b) 17 (34.0) 33 (66.0) 16 (32.0) 34 (68.0) Negative (153) 74 (48.4) 79 (51.6) 80 (52.3) 73 (47.7) RT-LAMP positive (51c) 13 (25.5) 38 (74.5) 14 (27.5) 37 (72.5) Negative (152) 78 (51.3) 74 (48.7) 82 (53.9) 70 (46.1) qRT-PCR positive the proportion decreased to 51.9 to 63.0% (14 to 17 out of 20) for samples obtained before day 5 of illness. the IgM/IgG ELISA tested positive in 35.0% (7/20), 70.4% (19/27) and 92.3% (60/65) of the samples obtained before, during, and after day 5 of illness. the error bars indicate the detection limit of qRT-PCR. the performance of the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays in comparison to the qRT-PCR assays is summarized in Table 3. the RT-RPA assay detected the DENV genome in 63.8% (30/47) of the acute dengue samples obtained within 5 days of illness. the RT-RPA assay detected the DENV genome in 63.8% (30/47) of the acute dengue samples obtained within 5 days of illness. sensitivity between groups was compared using McNemar's exact test. three RT-RPA primers and one exo probe were designed to allow the simultaneous detection of all four DENV serotypes in a single-tube reaction. dT-BHQ1, thymidine nucleotide carrying black hole quencher 1; 3\u2032C3-Spacer, C3 spacer at the 3\u2032 end to block elongation. detection limits of the RT-RPA assay were determined using a panel of serially diluted viral RNAs extracted from infected cell culture supernatants. sixty-one of the 130 samples (46.9%) tested viremic by qRT-PCR. twenty-two of the samples (16.9%) were identified as secondary DENV infections, as viral RNA and dengue-specific IgG were detected concurrently. three RT-RPA-positive samples tested negative by qRT-PCR. d Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples. eight dengue IgG- and qRT-PCR-positive samples tested negative. the viral loads ranged from 2.97 to 6.67 log10 DENV RNA copies/ml of serum. the mean viral load was 6.04 log10 RNA copies/ml on day 3 of illness. the mean viral load was 5.73 log10 RNA copies/ml on day 4, 5.57 log10 RNA copies/ml on day 5, 4.58 log10 RNA copies/ml on day 7, 3.91 log10 RNA copies/ml on day 8, and 5.11 log10 RNA copies/ 3 and 5 samples were positively detected by the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays. but these samples were found to be negative by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR results (no.)a Sensitivity (% [95% CIb]) PPVc (% [95% CI]) NPVd (% [95% CI]) qRT-PCR, RT-RPA, and RT-LAMP assays detected the DENV genome in 63.8% (30/47) of the acute dengue samples obtained within 5 days of illness. both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays showed significant increases (P 0.001) in positive detection to 95.7% (45/47) and 97.9% (46/47), respectively. the detection limit of the RT-RPA assay (50 copies of DENV RNA) was similar to that of RT-RPA assays previously reported for other RNA viruses. the detection limits ranged from 10 to 100 copies of viral RNA (18, 21, 23, 24, 26, 34) more than 80% of the misdetected viremic samples were positive when detected by IgM/IgG ELISA. the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays still performed as well as qRT-PCR for increasing the diagnostic coverage of febrile dengue patients. however, the false-positive detection of the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays could reflect the false-negative detection of qRT-PCR, possibly due to mismatches most of the dengue-suspected patients from the community near the UMMC came to the hospital long after the onset of fever (49) the low percentage of early-phase samples obtained could be a reflection of the unavailability of molecular diagnostics for dengue at the hospital. the early detection of deNV infection would in turn improve the recognition of severe dengue warning signs, such as impending intravascular leakages (49). the RT-RPA assay reported here has several advantages compared to the RT-LAMP assay. the RT-RPA assay is more amenable to scaling down for point-of-care applications than the RT-LAMP assay. the RT-RPA assay has a rapid run time (20 min) and can detect diverse DENV strains at viral titers up to 10 RNA copies. the RT-RPA assay can greatly enhance the diagnostic coverage of suspected dengue cases."}
