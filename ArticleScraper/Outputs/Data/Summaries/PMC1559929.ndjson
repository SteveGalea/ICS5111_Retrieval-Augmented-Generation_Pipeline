{"summary": "in many cancers the upregulation of certain growth factors or growth factor receptors represents key elements in the process of malignant transformation and progression of normal cells towards tumor cells leading to uncontrolled proliferation and decreased apoptosis. many novel therapeutic strategies focus on the reversal of this effect, that is, the inhibition of these proteins or the downregulation of their expression. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved, sequence-specific, posttranscriptional gene silencing phenomenon. it is triggered by double-stranded RNA molecules as described in dsRNA. RNAi relies on a multistep intracellular pathway which can be roughly divided into two phases. se III-type protein [9\u201312] into short 21\u201323 nucleotide fragments called siRNAs. these effector siRNAs contain a symmetric 2 nt overhang at the 3\u2032-end as well as a 5\u2032-phosphate and a 3\u2032-hydroxy group. this complex becomes activated with the single-stranded siRNA guiding the RISC complex to its complementary target RNA. the siRNAs are incorporated into a nuclease-containing multiprotein complex called RISC. the single-stranded siRNA guides the RISC complex to its complementary target mRNA. the cleaved mRNA molecule is rapidly degraded due to its unprotected RNA ends. omitting the initiation phase, they can be delivered directly into the target cell. additional silencing-enhancing criteria include an A in position 3 and a G at position 13 of the sense strand, the absence of a C or G at position 19 and, most importantly, a U in position 10 of the sense strand. RISC is comparable to most other endonucleases in preferentially cleaving 3\u2032 of U rather than any other nucleotide. oligonucleotides or plasmid-based expression vectors can be used to downregulate the expression of a given gene of interest or of pathological relevance in vivo. oligonucleotides or plasmid-based expression vectors can be used to specifically downregulate the expression of a given gene of interest or of pathological relevance in vivo. nonviral systems have emerged as a promising alternative for gene delivery. main requirements are the protection of nucleic acid \u201cload\u201d as well as their efficient uptake into the target cells with subsequent release of the DNA or RNA molecules. the efficient protection against enzymatic or nonenzymatic degradation is particularly important for RNA molecules including siRNAs. sized, offers advantages over DNA-based strategies and may be preferable for in vivo therapeutic use. a large number of papers focuses the use of unmodified siRNAs (Table 1) whose administration is often performed IV by hydrodynamic transfection (high pressure tail vein injection) alternative strategies for the application of naked siRNAs include various delivery routes which often provide an only local administration. administration of unmodified siRNAs to induce RNAi in vivo. based on direct application of siRNAs to induce RNAi in vivo. administration of unmodified siRNAs to induce RNAi in vivo. virus infections [109] transfection Hydrodynamic Pancreas Ins2 Downregulation of the Ins2 gene [110] transfection Hydrodynamic Blood-brain barrier Organic anion transporter 3 Brain-to-blood transport [111] transfection Other delivery routes Intraperitoneal Fibrosarcoma xenografts bcl-2 Growth inhibition [113] Local injection Optic nerve stump c-Jun, Bax, Apaf-1 Antiapoptosis in retinal [ TGF-1 Glomerulonephritis [127] electroporation Intratracheal Lung Fas Hemorrhagic shock and sepsis [128] Stereotactic injection Brain Agouti-related peptide Increased metabolic rate [129] to hypothalamus Intrathecal infusion Brain Pain-related cation channel P2X3 Decreased mechanical hyperanalgesia [126] using mini-osmotic pump Infusion into the Brain intravenous HST-1/FGF-4 Tumor growth inhibition [157] tumor xenograft in testes Atelocollagen Bone-metastatic Intravenous EZH2 Inhibition of metastatic [158] prostate cancer tumor growth Inactivated HVJ Subcutaneous HeLa Intratumoral Rad51 Enhancement of cisplatin [159] suspension xenografts anticancer effect Protamin-antibody Subcutaneous melanoma growth inhibition Intravenous Kidney Liposomes V2R Role of V2R in water/ [136] sodium homeostasis Intravenous Subcutaneous tumor DOPC liposomes EphA2 Tumor growth inhibition [137] xenograft Intravenous Lung Liposomes caveolin-1 Increase in lung [138] vascular permeability Intravenous/intraperitoneal Various Liposomes \u2013 Detection of FITC cationic polymer polyethylenimines are synthetic polymers available in branched or linear forms. PEIs possess a high cationic charge density due to a protonable amino group in every third position. cationic charges are generated by protonation of the amino groups. PEIs have been successfully used for nonviral gene delivery in vitro and in vivo. high molecular weight PEIs may be due to a more efficient uptake of the resulting PEI/DNA complexes. a decrease in the molecular weight of the PEI leads to an increase in complex size which may be favourable at least for in vitro use. other PEIs with very low molecular weight ( 2 kd) display little or no transfection efficacy even at very high N/P ratios. the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects of PEI complexes is only poorly understood. polymers with an amino group in every third position are protonated. PEI is able to complex negatively charged siRNAs leading to a compaction. siRNAs are protected from degradation due to their tight condensation in the complex. a novel low molecular weight PEI based on fractionation of a commercially available polyethylenimine demonstrates high siRNA protection and delivery efficacies in vitro. a novel low molecular weight PEI based on the fractionation of a commercially available polyethylenimine demonstrates high siRNA protection and delivery efficacies in vitro. protect siRNAs against nucleolytic degradation and show in vitro activity. in vivo delivery of intact siRNAs upon PEI complexation. agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting, and autoradiography. radiolabeled siRNA molecules were found in several organs including subcutaneous tumors, muscle liver, kidney and, to a smaller extent, lung and brain. overexpression of the HER-2 receptor has been observed in a wide variety of human cancers and cancer cell lines. HER-2 is an attractive target molecule for antitumoral treatment strategies including anti-HER-2 antibodies, low molecular weight inhibitors, or HER-2-specific gene-targeting approaches. athymic nude mice with subcutaneous SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma tumor xenografts were injected IP with 0.6 nmoles HER-2-specific naked (open circles) or PEI-complexed (closed circles) siRNAs 2\u20133 times per week. differences in tumor growth reach significance at day 5. a receptor ligand, VEGF, is a mitogenic and angiogenic growth factor stimulating tumor growth and angiogenesis in several tumors including prostate carcinoma. a selective tumor uptake and a VEGF R2 downregulation were observed, resulting in decreased tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. the in vivo treatment of nude mice led to the delivery of intact siRNAs into subcutaneous tumor xenografts and a significant inhibition of tumor growth. the injection of PEI-complexed PTN siRNAs into the CNS exerted antitumoral effects. this establishes the potential of PEI/siRNA-mediated PTN gene targeting as a novel therapeutic option in GBM. siRNA delivery strategies must provide siRNA protection and transfection efficacy, the absence of toxic and nonspecific effects, they must be efficacious also when using small amounts of siRNAs. this requires to overcome biological barriers after their administration to reach their target tissue or target organ."}
