{"summary": "pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease involves defects in innate immunity, mucociliary clearance, and excessive inflammation. but the degree to which noninfectious processes contribute to lung disease progression in CF remains unclear. proteomics analysis of BAL defined a CF mucoinflammatory signature dominated by neutrophil pathways. CF ferrets with a CFTR exon-10 disruption (12) and non-CF littermates were reared as previously described (19), with changes per the online supplement. the study was performed according to protocols approved by the IACUC of the university of Iowa. stains were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or diastase-resistant periodic acid\u2013Schiff. Statistical analysis was conducted using Prism version 7.0c (GraphPad Software) and R (version 3.3.3; online supplement for packages used) bronchial wall thickness, ratio of airway to vessel diameter, and distance of distal cartilaginous airways from the pleural surface were obtained from the left cranial and right caudal lobes. for details, see the online supplement. CF ferrets developed features of bronchiectasis (Figures 1A\u20131H) contrary to expectations, CF ferrets developed features of bronchiectasis. quantitation of these imaging parameters in non-CF ferrets that did not receive antibiotic treatment demonstrated no differences in any of the endpoints. blinded quantification of previously described parameters from computed tomography examinations performed while on antibiotics. each data point represents one ferret (n = 7; P value by paired two-sided rank sum test). bacterial load in the BAL did not significantly differ between the CF and non-CF control animals. qPCR assay measuring fungal copies of internal transcribed spacer 1 in BAL (22) found no more fungal DNA in CF animals than in control animals. lifelong maintenance of antibiotics prevents microbial colonization of the cystic fibrosis (CF) ferret lung and prolongs survival. group 2 (n = 6; P value by paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, P > 0.9999) was reared on continuous antibiotics from birth. CF kits reared without antibiotics rapidly succumb to lung infections. only 2 of 10 CF animals survived to 6 months of age. study led to an average survival of more than 1,143 77 days (n = 7; SEM), whereas CF ferrets treated symptomatically with antibiotics (19) survived 105 27 days (n = 10; SEM) thus, continuous combinational antibiotics led to an approximately 10-fold increased life span. percentage of neutrophils in BAL had an estimated difference in proportion for non-CF versus CF of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51 to 0.16) active neutrophil elastase in the BAL supernatant (C) and cell pellet (D) had an estimated difference in proportion for non-CF versus CF of 0.1 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.21; P = 0.061) -based immunoassay (25) verified to be reactive to ferret NE. we found no significant differences in active NE between non-CF and CF. the number of alveolar macrophages was non-significantly lower. CF subjects showed elevations in muc5B, S100 proteins, matrix metalloprotease 9, LTF, ANXA, and declines in TTR, VTN, KNG1 and SFTPA1. ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed significant upregulation of inflammatory response pathways that promote the chemotaxis, adhesion, and activation of leukocytes. top diseases or functions pathways included leukocyte migration (P = 1 1017), inflammatory response (P = 2.7 1017), cellular infiltration (P = 2.2 1013), adhesion of neutrophils (P = 1.6 1021), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (P = 1.1 1012). findings demonstrate that there is significant neutrophil-dominated inflammation in CF ferret lung despite continuous bacterial eradication. bacteria were visible in airway mucus of CF animals symptomatically treated with antibiotics. the airways of CF animals reared on combination antibiotics from birth did not have visible bacteria despite accumulated mucus. age-matched CF ferrets treated with symptomatic and continuous antibiotic therapy were compared with non-CF control animals. however, at this younger age only symptomatically treated CF ferrets retained significantly greater mucus in the airways as compared with control animals. n = 5\u20136 ferrets per group; P value by two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test, *P 0.05. non-CF ferrets are age-matched as best possible to provide comparison. scores from all CF and non-CF ferrets in B and C plotted against age in days. quantitation of these imaging parameters in non-CF ferrets showed no differences in any of the endpoints. bronchiectasis develops in the CF Ferret Lung despite antibiotic protection. bacterial infection and antibiotic-resistance were the underlying cause of bronchiectasis. only one of the seven CF animals exhibited transient colonization on two sequential BALs. bacterial CFU counts in the BAL from naive non-CF animals lacking exposure to antibiotics were not significantly different. the ratio of non-CF to CF is 0.7 (95% CI, 0.29\u20131.87; P = 0.48) in the BAL pellet (C), the ratio is 0.79 (95% CI, 0.35\u20131.78; P = 0.57). in the CF pellet (C), the ratio is 0.79 (95% CI, 0.35\u20131.78; P = 0.57). all CF animals treated symptomatically with antibiotics developed lethal bacterial lung infections with culturable bacteria in lung lysates significantly (P 0.0001) and substantially (>6 106-fold) above that of non-CF control animals treated with the same antibiotic regimen. the remaining eight of the CF animals succumbed to lung infection despite antibiotics. BAL samples retrieved from CF ferrets were starkly different from their active control animals. analysis of BAL cellular material revealed that the number of neutrophils was significantly higher in CF versus non-CF BAL. macrophages in BAL exhibiting activated phenotype in non-CF and CF samples. n = 7 animals for each genotype; P value by linear mixed effects model, **P = 0.0085. CF BAL retained far more soluble muc5B (Log2FC = 14.6; P 0.0001) as determined by quantitative liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (20, 26), as determined by quantitative liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. NE inhibitors (27) were also elevated in CF samples, primarily OLFM4 (28) (>100,000-fold increase in CF/non-CF) and mucin (29) protein from A with statistically significant P value (P 0.05) and log2 (fold change) CF/non-CF of 2 (B) or 2 (C). heatmap depicts the log2 (fold-change) in protein content of the BAL. neutrophil-dominated inflammation in the CF ferret lung despite continuous bacterial eradication. CF ferrets maintained on antibiotics still develop mucus obstruction and inflammation in the lung despite lack of colonization. sections of large (F) and small (G) airways from CF ferrets stained with hematoxylin and eosin (C) or diastase-resistant periodic acid\u2013Schiff (D and E) revealed inflammatory cells (arrows) and mucus (asterisk) within the lumen. mucus accumulation demonstrated an age-dependent trend (Figure 6D) these histologic findings support the earlier observations by QCT and BAL analysis in these animals. linear regression was calculated for each group and displayed on graphs. graphs show mean SEM. Discussion These findings add to the understanding of CF lung pathogenesis in several ways. these studies lay the groundwork for understanding processes in both the host and microbe that control bacterial adaptation in the CF lung. first, although our microbial assays can detect bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi in the lung and these infectious pathogens were not greater in CF as compared with non-CF ferrets, we have not ruled out viral pathogens. however, we believe viral infections are an unlikely cause of the CF lung disease because our experience with viral outbreak this is the first analysis of chronic CF lung disease in an animal model that spans up to 4 years. our analyses used age-matched control animals to quantitatively assess multiple endpoints including structural changes consistent with bronchiectasis, microbe presence, and proinflammatory changes in the BAL proteome. our findings complement recent studies in the -ENaC\u2013overexpressing (36\u201338) and SLC26A9-knockout (39) mouse models, where mucus plugging and inflammation develop in the absence of detectable infection (40). however, our data diverge from these studies in that elevated active NE was not observed in the CF as compared with non-CF BAL (38). there was significant accumulation of mucus and airway obstruction histologically in the CF ferret lung lacking culturable bacteria. however, it remains unclear if mucus accumulation itself is proinflammatory, potentially through altered physical properties at the airway surface, or if CFTR dysfunction itself is proinflammatory. the two major secreted mucins in the lung are Muc5AC and Muc5B (32, 41, 42) mucin subtype is required for airway defense of the murine lung (51) further studies in muc5B- and muc5AC-knockout ferrets may lend mechanistic insights into how each of these mucin subtypes contributes to airway obstruction and/or inflammation in the CF ferret lung. a larger sampling of multiple regions of the CF lung at the time of sacrifice demonstrated the level of culturable aerobic or anaerobic bacteria on multiple medias was no different than that of non-CF control animals. however, a larger sampling of multiple regions of the CF lung at the time of sacrifice demonstrated the level of culturable aerobic or anaerobic bacteria on multiple medias (33) was no different than that of non-CF control animals. the proteomic studies in BAL used isobaric tags capable of directly referencing the fold-change in a given protein between a CF animal and its matched control. we were able to study lung histopathology in samples obtained from study animals at the conclusion of the study. a recent study in chronically infected adult G551D-CFTR CF patients showed only transient (1 yr) reductions in sputum bacterial loads, but sustained reductions in inflammatory factors (10). this interesting finding also suggests an apparent disconnect between infection and inflammation after the restoration of CFTR function. lium, whereas Muc5B is predominantly produced by the submucosal glands (43, 44) submucosal glands express abundant CFTR (45) and fail to secrete properly in CF humans (46) and ferrets (14). our BAL proteomics studies demonstrated elevation of Muc5B in the CF lung, as compared with age-matched non-CF control animals. a pathogenic process occurs in the CF ferret lung even in the absence of clinically apparent infections. however, it remains unclear whether reduced mucus clearance is the cause of enhanced inflammation or if enhanced proinflammatory responses to normal levels of bacteria leads to excessive mucus secretion.
