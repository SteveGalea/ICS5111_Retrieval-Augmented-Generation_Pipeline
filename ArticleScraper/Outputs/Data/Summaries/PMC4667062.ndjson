{"summary": "Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is characterized by the accumulation of subretinal fluid between the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium following the formation of a retinal break. the pathogenesis of the condition is complex and incompletely understood, involving age-related and/or molecular changes of the vitreous extracellular matrix and vitreoretinal interface. retinal detachment was created in the right eyes of six new Zealand red pigmented rabbits. the eyes were normal with no evidence of disease on examination. a pipette tip was inserted into the eye through a pars plana incision. the vitreous samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. there was no gross evidence of blood or other contamination of the samples at the time of tissue harvesting. the strips were rehydrated for 20 h at room temperature in 200 L lysis buffer each containing 20 g protein from individual vitreous samples. the strips were then transferred to 12% polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis, which was performed at a maximum voltage of 50 V for approximately 20 h. gels were fixed overnight in 50% (v/v) ethanol, 12% (v/v) acetic acid, and 0.0185% (v/v) formaldehyde. gels were washed 3 times for 20 min in 35% (v/v) ethanol and pretreated for 1 min in 0.2% (w/v) Na2CO3 and 0.028% (v/v) formaldehyde. peptides generated by trypsin digestion were separated on an inert nano-LC system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) the raw data was processed using proteinLynx Global Server 2.1 (Waters) the search was undertaken with doubly and triply charged ions with up to two missed cleavages. sham Biological processes 5104 Albumin (608) fragment CCSESLVDR (500\u2013508) TVVGEFTALLDK (570\u2013581) EACFAVEGPK (589\u2013598) 52 14 28 5.67; 66.5 2.62 Transport; cellular response to starvation; maintenance of mitochondrial location; negative regulation of apoptosis; cellular response to starvation. membranes were blocked overnight with 5% skimmed milk in 80 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 buffer, pH 7.5. no suitable antibodies were commercially available for the rabbit F isoform of -1-antiproteinase or the rabbit collagen-I1 fragment that was identified with LC-MS/MS. retinal detachment was created in the right eyes of six new Zealand red pigmented rabbits. the eyes were normal with no evidence of disease on examination. a pipette tip was inserted into the eye through a pars plana incision. vitreous samples were homogenized and dissolved in a lysis buffer containing 9 M urea, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient (pH 3\u201310 nonlinear) and 2% (w/v) dithiothreitol (DTT) the protein samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. hydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 0.3% (w/v) DTT, and 2% (v/v) IPG buffer. gels were fixed overnight in 50% (v/v) ethanol, 12% (v/v) acetic acid, and 0.0185% (v/v) formaldeh s were washed 3 times for 20 min in 35% (v/v) ethanol and pretreated for 1 min in 0.2% (w/v) Na2S2O35H2O. development was arrested in a fixative solution of 40% (v/v) ethanol and 12% (v/v) acetic acid. the 2D gels were then dried between cellophane sheets and sealed in plastic envelopes. peptides generated by trypsin digestion were separated on an inert nano-LC system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) the massLynx 4 SP4 (Waters) was used to obtain spectra. the raw data was processed using proteinLynx Global Server 2.1 (Waters) the search was undertaken with doubly and triply charged ions with up to two missed cleavages.

RD represents retinal detachment. ten protein spots were found to be significantly and at least twofold differentially expressed between the sham and detachment vitreous groups. three protein spots were upregulated and seven spots were downregulated. western blotting could not be reliably used for quantification due to a weak signal near the detection limit and variable background reaction. blot analysis of sham rabbit vitreous developed with anti-albumin and anti-peroxiredoxin 2. labeled arrows correspond to the respective full length proteins. the unlabeled arrows for the lower molecular mass bands may indicate the specific cleavage fragments. western blot analysis of sham rabbit vitreous developed with anti-albumin and anti-peroxiredoxin 2 revealed fragments of albumin to be upregulated in the vitreous following retinal detachment. albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma, aqueous, and vitreous humor, where in the latter it constitutes around 60\u201370% of total protein. albumin in the vitreous may arise from de novo synthesis in the retina. it is similar to the reported increased gene and protein expression of albumin in the corneal epithelium during wound healing [29, 30]. albumin can also act as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species and sequestration of metal ions. peroxiredoxin 5 is a group of ubiquitous antioxidant proteins that currently comprise six members in mammals. these proteins are found at high levels intracellularly, mainly within the cytosol. they are also present in the mitochondria, peroxisomes, and nuclei, and they may be exported. collagen-I1 fragment was identified in the vitreous of the rabbit. however, type I collagen has not previously been identified as a natural component of the mammalian vitreous. collagen is a significant component of both epiretinal and subretinal PVR membranes. al collagen have been found to be increased with RRD and PVR. further studies will be necessary to confirm the source and nature of collagen-I1 in the vitreous. the possible mechanisms of collagen fragmentation may be an important feature of vitreous liquefaction and RRD. rabbit isoforms so far identified that has been shown to have the oxidizable methionine residue site that is present in human -1-antiproteinase [67], 68. this process is thought to enhance the ability of proteinases such as elastase to locally degrade tissue debris that occurs at sites of inflammation. western blot analysis showed an intense band at approximately 60 kDa corresponding with the full length albumin protein. increased albumin and its fragments may signify increased proteolysis and the passage of albumin into the vitreous. it is also possible that albumin may arise from de novo synthesis in the retina. this variation may represent the well-studied property of these proteins to undergo oligomerization, which can be promoted by a number of factors including overoxidation of cysteine residues of peroxiredoxin. this is in keeping with another study, which also showed some peroxiredoxin 2 western blot bands appearing at molecular mass much higher than 20 kDa that was suggested to result from oligomerization. peroxiredoxin 2 and other members of this family of proteins are liable to have a significant role in the pathophysiology of retinal detachment. this may be in keeping with reported reductions in the levels of other members of the antioxidant defense system such as glutathione and ascorbic acid in vitreal and in blood samples of patients suffering from PVR. the presence of collagen in the subretinal space suggests certain cells are able to synthesize collagen under certain pathological conditions such as retinal detachment and PVR. the present analysis suggests collagen-I1 fragment to be found in sham vitreous, which furthermore showed a decreased concentration following retinal detachment that may indicate perturbed proteolytic activity. -1-antiproteinase has the ability to inhibit a large number of serine proteases. this protein has the ability to inhibit a large number of serine proteases. it has also been localized to the tear film, aqueous humor, and vitreous. the rabbit vitreous has identified a set of proteins that assist our understanding of the pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and its complications. it has been postulated that one of the main functions of corneal -1-antiproteinase is to protect against the damaging effects of neutrophil elastase produced during corneal inflammation."}
