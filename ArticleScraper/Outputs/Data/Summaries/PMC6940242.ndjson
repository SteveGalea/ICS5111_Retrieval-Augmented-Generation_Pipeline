{"summary": "a total of 394 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected prospectively from children aged 0\u20135 years old with ARTIs from hospitals in Kuala Lumpur. a total of 15 types of RNA viruses and a single type of DNA virus were detected. no coronavirus was detected among children between 3 and 5 years old. in 2000, an estimated 1.9 million children succumbed to ARTIs globally, with 70% of the death occurred in Southeast Asian and African regions (1). ARTIs are commonly caused by viruses; such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human bocavirus, and human coronavirus (5-10). there is limited epidemiological data available on viral ARTIs in Malaysia. the study aims to determine the aetiologies of viral ARTIs among young children in Malaysia. a comprehensive and up-to-date epidemiological data on viral ARTIs would be vital for clinical management especially in preventing unnecessary antibiotic usage and hospitalization. as much as 18 L xTAG bacteriophage MS2 needed to be injected into 182 L of sample. the mixture was later incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 20 minutes in the same machine. nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from the patients using flocked swabs. the swabs were then transported via cold chain to the virology laboratory. the laboratory technicians would process and test the samples immediately. the association between categorical data such as age, gender, and ethnic groups with respiratory viruses was analyzed using games-Howell post-hoc test. 380 viruses were found among 315 (79.9%) positive specimens. Respiratory virus identified (% of total positive samples within age/gender/ethnic group) Enterovirus/rhinovirus 71 (42.0) 35 (30.4) 6 (19.4) 112 (28.4) 67 (37.2) 45 (33.3) 13 (27.1) 1 (25.0) 91 (37.8) 7 (31.8) RSV 53 (31.4) 30 (26.1) 2 (6.5) 85 (21.6) 42 (23.3) 43 (31.9) 16 (33.3) 0 62 (25.7) the prevalence of different viruses detected was also presented in Table 1. the 5 predominant viruses were enterovirus/rhinovirus (n=112, 28.4%), RSV (n=85, 21.6%), adenovirus (n=64, 16.2%), human bocavirus (n=34, 8.6%), and human metapneumovirus (n=. the 27 typeable parainfluenza viruses can be categorized into 2 cases (0.5%) of parainfluenza 1 virus, 1 case (0.3%) of parainfluenza 2 virus, 17 cases (4.3%) of parainfluenza 3 virus, and 7 cases (1.8%) of parainfluenza 4 virus. enterovirus/rhinovirus (P0.05) and RSV (P0.01) were significantly more common in this age group. difference =1.15, SE =0.30, P0.001), human metapneumovirus (mean difference =1.82, SE =0.30, P0.001), and coronavirus (mean difference =1.97, SE =0.30, P0.001) from all positive samples, 45.7% were male and 34.3% were female patients. boys were significantly more susceptible to influenza A than female children (P0.05). enterovirus/rhinovirus + adenovirus 12 (3.0) Enterovirus/rhinovirus + human bocavirus 6 (1.5) Enterovirus/rhinovirus + human metapneumovirus 3 (0.8) Enterovirus/rhinovirus + coronavirus OC43 2 (0.5) Enterovirus/rhinovirus + parainfluenza 3 2 (0.5) RSV + adenovirus 3 (0.8) RSV + human meta enterovirus/rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus showed pronounced seasonality. peak infection rate occurred in mid-year (from April 2015 to July 2015), and lowest activity in early of 2015 (january\u2013March). enterovirus/rhinovirus was found to be the most predominant viral agent among young children. bocavirus (8.6%), human metapneumovirus (7.4%) and influenza A virus H1N1 (2.8%) were detected in this study. coronavirus 229E differs clinically from other respiratory viruses (34). 229E infections until they are able to develop antibodies between the age of 2.5 to 3.5 years old (38). boys were more vulnerable (45.7%) to ARTIs than girls. highest burden of viral infection (18.0%) was recorded in June. to implement the necessary prevention and management strategies for young children with ARTIs in Malaysia."}
