{"summary": "microbial nucleic acids are amplified by multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers labeled by a photocleavable link to molecular tags of different molecular weight. the identity of the microbe in the clinical sample is determined by its cognate tags. masscode tags have a modular structure, including a tetrafluorophenyl ester for tag conjugation to primary amines. a mass spectrometry sensitivity enhancer for photoredox cleavage of the tag from the analyte. a library of 64 different tags has been established. masscode tags were decoupled from amplified products through UV light-induced photolysis in a flow cell. detection threshold of 100 DNA copies was determined by using plasmid and synthetic RNA standards*. sensitivity of mass Tag PCR to detect live virus was reduced by the use of RNA instead of DNA templates. RNA extracted from serial dilutions of titered stocks of coronaviruses and parainfluenzaviruses was consistently positive in Mass Tag PCR. RNA was applied to RNA obtained from banked samples of cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue that had been previously characterized by conventional diagnostic RT-PCR. two of 3 cases of west Nile virus encephalitis were correctly identified. seven of 12 cases of enteroviral meningitis were detected. mass Tag PCR is a sensitive and specific tool for molecular characterization of microflora. the advantage of Mass Tag PCR is its capacity for multiplex analysis. potential applications include differential diagnosis of infectious diseases, blood product surveillance, forensic microbiology, and biodefense."}
