{"summary": "study focuses on hCoV-NL63 open reading frame 3 (ORF 3) which is highly conserved accessory protein among coronaviruses. expression in infected CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. hCoV-NL63 is one of four circulating prototypic human Coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 infection causes upper and lower respiratory tract disease. hCoV belongs to the Nidovirales. structural gene portion of coV genomes contains a variable number of accessory ORFs. accessory ORFs are not shared between different CoV groups. others may be dispensable for virus replication in cultured cells of primate or rodent origin. hCoV-NL63 has a homologous gene named ORF 4 that is split into two ORFs (4a and 4b) in cell culture but maintained in all circulating viruses. hCoV-229E has a homologous gene named ORF 4 that is split into two ORFs (4a and 4b) in cell culture. hCoV-NL63 encodes a 225 aa protein (approximately 26 kDa) with three putative transmembrane domains. hCoV-NL63 encodes a 225 aa protein (approximately 26 kDa) with three putative transmembrane domains. no O-glycosylation sites are predicted. the sequence of ORF 3 was analyzed using BLAST and MEGA4. the sequence of ORF 3 (GenBank accession no. AY567487.2) was analyzed using BLAST and MEGA4. a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide representing the C-terminal aa 211-225 of the predicted ORF 3 protein yielded fluorescence in the cytoplasm. overlapping subcellular localization was reported for SARS-CoV proteins 3a and M [50], it was analyzed whether hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 and M proteins were located in the same compartment. localization was also seen for anti-NL63 M and anti-ERGIC53 signals. hCoV-NL63 infected CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells by immunofluorescence assay. subcellular localization study of overexpressed hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 protein in Huh-7 cells. co-staining of cellular organelles with mouse-anti-ERGIC53 (A), mouse-anti-Golgi 58 K for the Golgi (B), goat-anti-LAMP-1 for trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and Lysosomes (LYS) together with goat (or donkey)-anti-mouse- the ERGIC compartment was stained in transfected cells as described above. GFP-E and GFP-M both showed extensive colocalization with FLAG-ORF 3 protein. protein complexes were localized predominantly within the ERGIC. analysis was performed with the help of a confocal laser scanning microscope (cLSM 510 Meta, Zeiss) bars represent 20 m. to exclude altered subcellular localization contributed by the fusion tags on the overexpressed structural proteins, experiments were repeated in HEK-293T cells using FLAG-ORF 3 in combination with HA tagged E, M and N proteins. hCoV-NL63 (MOI 0.01) cells were inoculated with hCoV-NL63 (MOI 0.01) and analyzed by Western blot after 4 days using antibodies against the ORF 3 protein C-terminus. larger bands ORF 3 g and M0 are assumed to be the result of posttranslational modification. a perinuclear distribution of fluorescence was observed with both antibodies. in non-permeabilized cells, only the anti-FLAG antibody yielded fluorescence at cell surfaces. a clear intracellular localization of the C-terminus could not be determined. a vector expressing ORF 3 protein with a C-terminal V5 tag, asparagine (N) at position 16 was changed into glutamine (Q) in-vitro translated 35S-radiolabelled proteins with and without the exchange were treated with endoglycosidase H prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.
