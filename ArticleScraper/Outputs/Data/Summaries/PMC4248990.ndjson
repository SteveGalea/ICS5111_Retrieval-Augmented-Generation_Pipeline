{"summary": "two HSV types have been identified so far, including HSV-1 and HSV-2. the two viruses can infect neurons and thereby cause neurological diseases. they can also establish latency in sensory neurons and result in the infected patient being a lifelong virus carrier. gD binding to receptor would displace its C-terminal profusogenic domain (PFD), thereby activating the gB/gH/gL fusion executor (20\u201322). gD is also an important contributing factor to a broad cell-type tropism of HSV by engaging diversified cellular receptors (23). thus far, a series of host molecules have been reported to be recognized by HSV gD. it was revealed that the gD molecule contains a V-set immunoglobulin-like (IgV-like) core that is wrapped by large terminal extensions. this forms a striking contrast to the binding mode of HSV-1 gD with HVEM. either way of receptor engagement by HVEM or nectin-1 should displace a \u201cprelocated\u201d C-terminal loop in gD as observed in a previous dimeric structure (38). analysis characterizing binding properties of nectin-1 with both viruses. soluble proteins of HSV-1 gD and nectin-1 were prepared as previously described. gD ectodomain proteins were expressed in Hi5 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. mutant proteins were prepared using the same refolding and purification procedure as described for the wild-type (WT) nectin-1. all the purified proteins were then exchanged to a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. the binding assay was carried out with a GE Healthcare system. binding data were fitted using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model or the steady-state affinity model for dissociation constant (Kd) calculations. the calculated kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. the chi-square (2) value is less than 1/10 of the maximum response unit (RUmax) crystallization and data collection for free HSV-2 gD/nectin-1 complex crystals were mixed at a 3:1 molar ratio and then used to screen the Hampton Research kits. the built structure models were further refined using REFMAC (49) and Phenix (50) and manually adjusted in Coot (51) for several cycles. in each cycle, the stereochemistry of the model was monitored by Procheck (52). values for the outmost resolution shell are given in parentheses. b Rmerge = ihkl | Ii I> |/ihklIi, where Ii is the observed intensity and I> is the average intensity from multiple measurements. luciferase activity was tested using a luciferase assay kit bought from Promega. the virus entry and entry inhibition assay follows the same procedure as the one described for the entry assay. the soluble proteins of HSV-1 gD and nectin-1 were prepared as previously described (35), and HSV-2 gD (strain 333) gD ectodomain proteins were expressed in Hi5 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. a GP67 signal sequence was engineered to the N terminus of gD to facilitate protein secretion. mutant proteins were prepared using the same refolding and purification procedure as described for the wild-type (WT) nectin-1. all the purified proteins were then exchanged to a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. the binding assay was carried out with a BIAcore 3000 system.

nectin-1 proteins were mixed at a 3:1 molar ratio. the conditions were then optimized. diffractable crystals were finally obtained by mixing 1 l of the protein preparation (3 mg/ml) with 1 l reservoir

Ramachandran plots were generated by using the program PROCHECK. the fusion mediated by HSV gB/gD/gH/gL and the receptors has been validated in various cell types. the virus entry and entry inhibition assays were tested using a luciferase assay kit bought from Promega. the virus was incubated with the WT or mutant nectin-1 proteins for 1 h before it was inoculated into the nectin-1-expressing cells. these amino acids are arranged into a nine-stranded (A\u2032, B, C, C\u2032, C\u2032\u2032, D, E, F, and G) IgV-like core in the center and several surface components of -helices (1, 1\u2032, 2) and loops wrapping the center core on the exterior. this observed structure is very similar to previously reported gD structures. the colored arrows mark, in the individual structures, the positions of the structure termini and the conformations of the loops referred to in the text. those elements that are invisible in our structure but are clearly traced in the reference structures are circled and labeled. despite a conserved fold as revealed by the low rmsd values, our HSV-2 gD structure exhibits an unexpected feature in the external extension region relative to the aforementioned gD structures. complex structure of HSV-2 gD bound to nectin-1 was solved at 3.2- resolution. gD residues P23 to P254 and nectin-1 amino acids V33 to E335 are successfully traced in electron density map. gD molecule shows a typical structure of an IgV core wrapped by extensive terminal extensions. in-1 CC\u2032C\u2032\u2032FG rear sheet and the gD terminal extensions are circled and labeled. the binding relies on the surface components in the terminal extensions of HSV-2 gD engaging the rear (CC\u2032C\u2032\u2032FG) sheet of the nectin-1 IgV domain. a high complementarity in both the shape and the hydrophobicity character is observed between the two molecules at this interface. the patch1 residues, including P23, L25 to Q27, F223, N227, V231, and Y234, locate in the distal N-terminal loop and the 3 helix. the remaining interface residues of R36 to H39, Q132, R134, P198, and V214 to R222 form the much more extended surface patch2. mutagenesis study on nectin-1 binding of HSV-1 and HSV-2 gDs. a total of 13 amino acids were selected and mutated individually or simultaneously. mutant proteins were prepared and purified as described for the wild-type protein and were further tested for the binding to gD (HSV-1 and HSV-2) proteins immobilized at 750 response units. a series of residues, including K61, T63, Q64, Q76, N82, L90, E125, P130, and N133, do not significantly affect the gD/nectin-1 interaction. this result is consistent with previous studies reporting the functional indispensability of nectin-1 N77, M85, and F129 in the receptor recognition by HSV-1 gD. the binding interface between HSV-2 gD (green) and nectin-1 (cyan) is highlighted for the intermolecule contacts contributed by these four residues. the 2|Fo|-|Fc| electron density map was contoured at 1.0. fusion executor of gB/gH/gL and the nectin-1 receptor are expressed separately in CHO-K1 cells. the fusion is specifically inhibited by the soluble gD protein of its original virus type in a dose-dependent manner. in each case, the fusion is specifically inhibited by the soluble gD protein of its original virus type in a dose-dependent manner. the dissociation constants (Kds) of nectin-1/I80A bound to HSV-1 and HSV-2 gDs were determined to be 1 M and 1.47 M, respectively. these values are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those observed for the WT nectin-1 protein (12.5 nM for HSV-1 gD and 19.1 nM for HSV-2 gD) mutations of N77A, M85A, and F129A were shown to dramatically impair the cell entry efficiencies of HSV-1. an approximate 2.5-fold decrease in the viral invasion was observed for the I80A mutant in comparison to that of the WT protein. tetra-TQEN mutant, however, is as capable of mediating virus entry as WT nectin-1. mutants with compromised gD-binding capabilities exhibit decreased capacities in inhibiting HSV-1 entry. the structure of free HSV-2 gD includes two gD molecules per asymmetric unit. the solved structure includes two gD molecules per asymmetric unit. over 156 C atoms to an HSV-1 gD structure binding with nectin-1 (PDB code 3U82) and an rmsd of 0.71 over 155 C atoms to the recently reported HSV-2 gD structure in the antibody-binding form (PDB code 3W9E). the two molecules (chains A and B) present in the asymmetric unit are shown. the IgV-like core is in green, while the N- and C- gD residues P23 to R36, A185 to P194 and nectin-1 amino acids V33 to E335 are successfully traced in the electron density map. the equivalent amino acids are consistently shown in the reference structures to form a long loop and a short strand (str2) in the N terminus, an intervening G-2 loop, and a long helix (3) in the C terminus. the binding interface involves the nectin-1 CC\u2032C\u2032\u2032FG rear sheet and the gD terminal extensions, which are circled and labeled. a superimposition comparison of a previously reported complex structure between HSV-1-gD (orange) and nectin-1 (magenta) with the bound structure of HSV-2-gD (green) with nectin-1 (cyan) is highlighted in the black box. the amino acids involved are shown in sticks and labeled. the binding relies on the surface components in the terminal extensions of HSV-2 gD engaging the rear (CC\u2032C\u2032\u2032FG) sheet of the nectin-1 IgV domain. the interface residues within a distance of 4.5 from the nectin-1 receptor were selected and aligned in a pairwise manner. as to the receptor, the identified gD footprint in nectin-1 is composed of 26 amino acids, including S59, K61, T63, Q64, T66, Q68, G73 to N77, I80 to N82, M85 to S88, L90, E125, A127 to T131. alanine-scanning mutagenesis in nectin-1 was characterized and compared by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) a total of 13 amino acids were selected (based on the complex structure solved in this study and our previously solved HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 structure) the mutant proteins were then prepared and purified as described for the wild-type protein. the gD proteins of HSV-1 (upper panel) and HSV-2 (lower panel) were immobilized on CM5 chips at 750 response units and were then tested for binding by 1 M the indicated nectin-1 (WT or mutant) proteins. the amount of bound protein in response units was recorded and presented as percentage of that of the WT nectin-1 using histograms. in the upper sheet region, where the remaining three amino acids reside, I80 and M85 are shown to extensively contact HSV-2 gD Y38, Q131, and P221 via strong hydrophobic interactions. N77 could contribute to the ligand binding by providing H-bond interactions via both the side chain and main-chain nitrogens with gD D215 and M219. cross-inhibition of the gD/nectin-1-mediated cell fusion by soluble HSV luciferase activity plotted as percentage of that without soluble gDs or hNUDT16 protein. nectin-1 I80 is a newly identified residue that affects the gD binding. binding affinities increased approximately 2- to 5-fold in comparison to WT nectin-1. the tetra-TQEN mutant, however, is as capable of mediating virus entry as WT nectin-1. nectin-1 I80 is an important interface residue involved in the gD binding. Flow-cytometric assay characterizing the expression level of each nectin-1 protein. CHO-K1 cells expressing individual nectin-1 proteins are infected with HSV-1 viruses. gD-receptor interaction is considered a key step bridging attachment and fusion processes. nectin-1 appears to play a more important role in mediating the infection by HSV-2, at least in in vivo models. soluble gD proteins of the two viruses could mutually inhibit the gD/nectin-1-mediated cell fusion. compared to the HSV-1 gD (free or bound) (35\u201337) or the bound HSV-2 gD structures (42), the unbound HSV-2 gD structure lacks traceable electron densities for a large portion of the terminal extensions at both the N and C termini. this could be either a result of cleavage\u2014re several studies also reported the replacement of the gD N-terminal loop by uPA, interleukin-13 (IL-13) and the HER2 antibody, the chimeric gDs derived from which are functionally active in mediating virus entry into cells expressing their respective cognate receptors. alanine substitution dramatically impairs the interaction between gD (HSV-1 or HSV-2) and nectin-1. similar phenomena have been reported in other protein-protein interactions. gD binds to the dimer interface of nectin-1 and would compete against its dimerization (35, 56)."}
