{"summary": "more than an estimated 700,000 children under the age of five died of RV in 2011. a case report from 2010 described the RV transmission from a RotaTeq vaccinated child to its unvaccinated sibling. the transmitted RV strain was a reassorted vaccine-derived strain. Virus-like-particles comprise a high density of epitopes on their surface. they can be recognized by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate a humoral and cellular immune response through similar pathways. vaccines based on purified VLPs, for example, are on the market. the assembly of RV structural proteins into rotavirus like particles requires the simultaneous expression of several recombinant RV genes in a single cell followed by multiple purification steps of these RVLPs. to circumvent these problems but maintaining the ease of application and safety, we decided to trigger the immune response using RVLPs produced within cells of the vaccinee. we aimed to increase the amounts of VLP-generating and immunizing proteins synthesized in situ. we optimized the amino acid sequence to the codon usage of human cells. the number of placental layers between mothers and their fetuses is different for various mammals, which affects or inhibits the ability to transfer antibodies during pregnancy. RV protein encoding HSV-1 amplicon vectors induce a RV specific antibody response detected in sera as well as in sera of vaccinated offspring nursed by vaccinated animals. full protection of the newborn against RV induced symptoms was not achieved under the present experimental conditions. the synthetic RV cassettes derived from the human Wa strain were adjusted to human codon usage (sWa, sWa) the RRV[VP7/6/2] was derived from the rhesus strain RRV. the sWa[VP2/6/7_V5] amplicon vector harbors a C-terminal V5 tag at VP7. RRV[VP7/6/2] or GFP HSV-1 amplicon vectors (MOI 2) or non-transduced (mock) and total cell lysates were harvested 24 hpt. all three RV proteins mediated by the synthetic HSV-1 amplicon vectors sWa[VP2/6/7. the tagged VP7 (VP7_V5) was detected using the V5 antibody in cells transduced with sWa[VP2/6/7_V5]. the codon-optimized vector sWa[VP2/6/7 induced an enhanced protein synthesis in human cells over the non-codon-optimized vector RRV[VP7/6/2]. this effect was not observed in the murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 (Figure 1C all three RV structural proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7 were synthesized from the newly designed HSV-1 cassettes in human and non-human cells. the codon-optimization led to an increased quantity of generated RV proteins in human cells. cells were transduced (MOI 5) with the HSV-1 amplicon vector sWa[VP2/6/7_V5. cells were harvested 24 hpt from monolayers by pelleting and fixation with 4% formaldehyde and embedded in LR White. we injected female mice with 106 transducing units per dose intramuscularly (i.m.) in a prime-boost regimen with sWa[VP2/6/7] or the GFP encoding amplicon vector as control. five days after the prime immunization, males were added to the females. nineteen days after the prime immunization, dams were boosted. 2.15% at 10 dpb, 1.38% at 14 dpb and 1.92% at 20 dpb. this indicates a RV specific antibody response was triggered upon sWa[VP2/6/7] vector immunization. time point 0 indicates relative sera IgG levels before booster immunization. time point 10 includes values from animals from 9 to 10 days post-booster immunization. time point 14 includes samples taken on 13 and 14 dpb and time point 20 from 20 to 21 dpb. dams obtained the booster dose 20 days after prime immunization. p-values of A versus C, D or E are indicated: ***, p 0.001. levels of RV-specific IgG in milk of sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized mice were found to be at 46.64%. swas immunized in a prime-boost regimen with either sWa[VP2/6/7] amplicon or as control GFP amplicon or Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS). a similar RV specific IgG titer was found in terminal sera of pups from sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams as in sera from pups nursed from HBSS control injected dams. the sWa[VP2/6/7] amplicon vector raises a RV specific immune response, detected as IgG in sera as well as in milk of immunized animals. this response is passed to the offspring via both the placental and the lactogenic route. suckling mice developed diarrhea within comparable periods of incubation time. Serum Antibodies Raised in Vaccinated Dams were Specific for Rotavirus Proteins VP2 and VP6. swa[VP2/6/7] comprised three RV antigens, the main structural proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7. to test this, immune fluorescence was performed using the sera from vaccinated mice. cinated dams served as primary antibodies (diluted 1:100) and were detected by the secondary antibody anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 594 (red). DAPI was used to stain the nuclei (blue) polyclonal anti-RV serum served as positive control. LPs using rabbit polyclonal anti-RV serum and a secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles confirmed the VLP\u2019s identity as RV-like. two days after transduction, RVLPs were purified over a sucrose cushion. western blot analysis of the isolated RVLPs was performed. VP7 is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized at the ER [29] and seemed to localize with the ER membranes. VP7 was abundantly present in transduced cells. herpes simplex virus type-1 amplicon particles deliver a DNA cassette. a single polycistronic messenger RNA contains the coding sequences of three RV capsid proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7 separated by internal ribosome entry sites. the HSV-1 origin of DNA replication (oriS) and packaging/cleavage signal (pac) and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (polyA) are indicated. the predicted migration lengths of VP2 (104 kDa), VP6 (45 kDa), VP7 (37 kDa), VP7_V5 (42 kDa), actin (42 kDa) and GFP (27 kDa) are indicated on the left with arrows. the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was stained using the Alexa-Fluor 405 conjugated lectin concanavalin A (grey) synthesis of the RV proteins mediated by the synthetic HSV-1 amplicon vectors sWa[VP2/6/7] and sWa[VP2/6/7_V5 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates. v5-tagged VP7 was detected in the cytoplasm as dot structures. the codon-optimization led to an increased quantity of generated RV proteins in human and non-human cells. hepG2 cells were transduced (MOI 5) with the HSV-1 amplicon vector sWa[VP2/6/7_V5. cells were harvested 24 hpt from monolayers by pelleting and fixation. orescence micrograph, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the nuclei (blue) and RV proteins were stained using the anti-RV serum and the secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 488 (green); (D) Enlargement of the area of interest of the stitched tileset showing the highly RV-positive-marked electron-dense region marked in (C) relative RV-specific IgG (rIgG) level of 54.85% at day 10 post-booster immunization (dpb) decreased to 37.89% rIgG at 14 dpb and then decreased to 23.78% rIgG at 20 dpb. rIgG levels of the GFP vector immunized control group were low over the entire duration of the experiments. positive control always the same sera of a sWa[VP2/6/7] or GFP amplicon vector immunized mouse from a previous study [17] (diluted 1:5000) was used. values from nave sera are plotted on the time point 19 as these samples were taken before the first immunization. vector immunized dams or Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) injected control dams was plotted in relation to the positive control (set as 100%) in group A, offspring was born from HBSS injected dams but raised by sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams. group C includes offspring born and raised by HBSS-injected control animals. swa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams showed higher levels of IgG2a. swa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams showed higher levels of IgG2a. swa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams showed higher levels of IgG2a compared to IgG1. titer was still elevated compared to the controls (Figure 3E, group \u201cD\u201d). we conclude that RV specific IgG antibody transfer via the placental route occurred. the level of antibody had to be maintained by the lactogenic route by immunized dams. pups from vaccinated dams had lowest DD50 (DD50/mL) titers. pups swapped had 20\u201350 times higher DD50/mL values. subsequent experiments indicated variables due to the age of the pups at the time of challenge. antibodies against the RV VP2 and the VP6 proteins were detected in sera of the sWa[VP2/6/7] vaccinated dams. only antibodies against the RV VP2 and the VP6 proteins were detected in the sera of the vaccinated dams. RVLPs formed upon transduction of sWa[VP2/6/7] gene expression cassettes were analyzed using electron microscopy. in a second step, the composition of purified particles was examined using Western blot analysis. cells were harvested 48 hpt and RVLPs were purified and concentrated from the supernatant over a sucrose cushion. the concentrated RVLPs (purified RVLPs, left panel) and the RV proteins remaining in the cell pellet obtained during RVLP harvesting were analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-RV antibody. con vector delivering a DNA cassette encoding a single polycistronic messenger RNA triggered the synthesis of all three encoded RV proteins. a cell-type dependent increase of the desired protein synthesis due to codon-optimization of the capsid protein coding sequences in the vector. a synthetic and codon-optimized DNA cassette maintained the original amino acid sequences of the three major capsid proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7. a rationale of structural vaccinology is to maintain the native three-dimensional structure and stabilize the conformation of antigens to induce an efficacious immune response. the viral structure is assembled by several proteins on the VLP surface mimicking the native virions. the structural aspect of RVLPs is important for RV specific generation of protective antibodies. a better understanding of the RV assembly process is needed to solve the problem of VP7 incorporation into VLPs in the future. protection against RV infection in adult mice can be measured by reduction of fecal virus shedding after oral challenge (adult mouse model) amplicon vector induced a Th1 type of immune response with an increased level of IgG2a over IgG1. this response might be an indication that our system would be able to induce mucosal IgA in humans. rotavirus diarrhea relied on the lactogenic transfer of IgA against VP7 or VP4. in the present case, the transfer of antibodies from the immunized mothers to their suckling mice seemed efficient. however, at least three factors may have influenced the protective outcome in a negative way. pigs, classified in group 3, show extensive absorption of all classes of immunoglobulins but only for the first 12 h. this property is even enhanced by the ability of the pigs to produce high amounts of IgA in response to vaccination. two possible future approaches emerge from these considerations. the human RV strain was obtained from Catherine Eichwald (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland); it was propagated in MA104 cells as previously described. the sequence for the construction of synthetic transgene cassettes of sWa[VP2/6/7] and sWa[VP2/6/7_V5 was derived from the human RV strain Wa (Dhaka isolate) vector stocks were generated by the Gateway L/R recombination between the attL sites containing entry vector pE_sWaRV_STOP and the attR sites containing destination vector pHSV-EYFP-RfC_C.1. the amplicon expression plasmids pHSV-EYFP-RfC_C.1 and pHSV-V5/His contain a transcription unit consisting of the HSV-1 immediate early early (IE cells were scraped into the medium, freeze/thawed, sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. for immunization of mice, vector stocks were further purified and concentrated by centrifugation over a 25% sucrose cushion. titers were determined as TU/mL. or sucrose purified RVLPs were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with primary antibodies. guinea-pig anti-rotavirus polyclonal serum raised against whole virus (1:4000, strain RF), mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:8000, JL-8, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) cells were fixed 24 hpt with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. cells were blocked with PBS supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin. the ER was stained using the Alexa-Fluor 405 conjugated lectin ConA. sera was diluted 1:100 and detected by staining with a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 594 (1:500; Molecular Probes) images were taken using the fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer inverted microscope, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) chemical Fixation and Embedding in Epon HepG2 cells were transduced (MOI 5) with the HSV-1 amplicon vector sWa[VP2/6/7. after 24 h, the cells were scraped into the medium and resuspended in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA), centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 g. ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and coated resulting cell pellet was fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M Na/K phosphate buffer for 4 h. the pellet was dehydrated with ascending ethanol series starting at 70%. then, the pellet was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1.5 h in a 2:1 mix of LR White/Ethanol followed by infiltration of LR White. Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 in 0.1% BSA-c for 1 h at RT. sections were stained with DAPI (0.1 mg/mL) for 15 min. after staining, the sections were sandwiched between a microscope slide and a coverslip in PBS. the whole grid was imaged in bright field and fluorescence. the entire area of interest was pre-irradiated with a high current (26 nA), large frame size (6144 4096 pixels) and short dwell time (50 ns) for about 30 min. 4.9. mice were mated by adding one male to two females per cage. ELISA plates were coated with sucrose concentrated wt RV (strain Wa), washed with PBS-Tween (phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated with the samples. a serum pool of a RV hyper immunized mice was used to normalize the values taking the hyper immune sera as 100%. IgG1; IgG2a; IgG2b monoclonal immunoglobulins were coated in identical concentrations directly to ELISA plates as antigen. serum samples of dams and their pups (diluted 1:1000) were reanalyzed with the antigen coated as above but the IgG isotypes were detected. primer probe mix was selected because it was the most sensitive kit. reaction was run in a thermal cycler (CFX96 C1000 Touch, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) two-way ANOVA with weighted means and Tukey ad hoc testing were performed using the open source program RStudio. cells and Viruses Vero 2-2 (African green monkey kidney epithelium cells, [42]), Hepa 1-6 (mouse epithelial hepatocytes, ATCC), MA104 (embryonic African green monkey kidney, ATCC) and HepG2 (human liver hepatocellular cells, AT the codon adaption index was calculated using The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) the attB flanked synthetic gene expression cassettes (sWaRV) encoding the RV proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7, separated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) either with or without stop codon (pE_sWaRV) were cloned. ids pHSV-EYFP-RfC_C.1 and pHSV-V5/His contain a transcription unit consisting of the HSV-1 immediate early (IE) 4/5 promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. the HSV-1 origin of replication (oriS) and the HSV-1 packaging/cleavage signal (pac) necessary for packaging into helper virus-free HSV-1 amplicon particles. cells were counted using an inverted fluorescence microscope. the titers were determined as TU/mL. cells were transduced with the indicated amplicon vectors.
