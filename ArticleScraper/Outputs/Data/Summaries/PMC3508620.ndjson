{"summary": "3D domain swapping is a novel structural phenomenon observed in diverse set of protein structures in oligomeric conformations. a distinct structural feature characterizes 3D domain swapping. 3D domain swapping was observed as a key mediator of numerous functional mechanisms. five major classes of disease were found to be associated with 3D domain swapping using functional disease ontology based enrichment analysis. KEGG pathways were found to be associated with 3D domain swapping using functional disease ontology based enrichment analysis. 3DSwap is the first database that catalogued proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. the database was developed using a literature-based protein structural curation strategy that used manual curation and a structural bioinformatics pipeline to gather data relating to 3D domain swapping. proteins involved in such diseases have higher aggregation propensities. from a clinical perspective, such diverse disease manifestations mediated by this single structural mechanism are of great interest. it still remains elusive whether 3D domain swapping is exclusively associated with such conformational diseases. enrichment analysis was performed using annotations derived from Pfam domains [56], GO [57-59], KEGG pathways [60] and Disease Ontology [61,62]. a nomenclature was proposed to classify enrichment tools in bioinformatics as singular enrichment analysis (SEA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [63] and modular enrichment analysis (MEA) [55]. a priori defined set of genes can be considered as a prior gene list. the background can be defined one or more datasets compiled in Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [70] 69 tools are currently available for the functional enrichment analysis. notations of protein domains (Pfam [56], SMART[77]), pathways (KEGG [60], GenMAPP[78]) and human gene-disease associations are currently used for enrichment analysis. any ontology maintained by Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) [80] foundry or its mapping or derivatives (for example: disease-ontology (DOLite) [61]) can be effective for enrichment analysis. P-values were derived from DAVID using a modified Fisher Exact P-value. disease enrichment analysis was performed using Functional Disease Ontology server. only two scenarios (domain swapped dimer and open-ended oligomeric swapping) of 3D domain swapping are provided in the figure. proteome-wide analysis of this unique structural mechanism was impossible due to the non-availability of proteome level curated dataset. 3DSwap offers a compendium of 293 protein structures with delineated hinge regions, swapped regions. an enrichment p-value was calculated by comparing the observed frequency of an annotation term with the frequency expected by chance and individual terms beyond the p-value cut-off (P-value 0.05). a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant differences, when compared between two biological states. 69 tools are currently available for functional enrichment analysis. a recent review cited 69 tools for such analysis. the list of tools is rapidly growing. open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) [80] foundry or its mapping or derivatives (for example: disease-ontology (DOLite) [61]) can be effectively used for enrichment analysis. study used four tools, two ontologies and two annotation databases. protein domain enrichment was performed using DAVID 6.7. methods Curated dataset of human proteins involved in 3D domain swapping Classification of proteins in 3DSwap knowledgebase based on SOURCE record from PDB. a cursory look at 3DSwap database would indicate that the largest fraction was from humans (25.6%). gene ontology enrichment analysis GO term enrichment analysis was performed using Ontologizer 2.0, a multifunctional tool for GO term enrichment analysis. GO enrichment tools calculate the enrichment of a GO term with respect to the list of genes in the dataset. a gene or gene product annotated with a term x is also annotated to all parent terms of x. this often leads to false enrichment calculations. dataset consisting of 45 Uniprot identifiers were used for species specific GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis. disease ontology tem enrichment analysis was performed using disease ontology server. list of 45 human genes mapped to UNIPROT identifiers were mapped using custom Perl scripts. 35 genes were found to be associated with at least one disease. bioinformatics pipeline employed to derive functional, pathway and diseases associations of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. a list of protein domains was obtained from proteins involved in 3D domain swapping and a list of protein domains was obtained. gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Ontologizer 2.0. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using Pfam annotations. ontologizer was selected due to improved statistical approximation methods. Gene Ontology was defined using 33,738 terms and 59,508 relations recorded in the gene_ontology.obo file. Background population for statistical tests was defined using 18,257 proteins encoded in the human genome with Gene Ontology annotations. pathways associated with these proteins were obtained from KEGG pathway database. oligomers often associated with aggregation diseases or proteinopathies in humans. no comprehensive study has been reported to analyze the impact of all proteins involved in 3D domain swapping from a whole proteome-wide or genome-wide perspective.

Availability of genome-scale sequence data and annotations was considered as the ideal resource for gaining new insights. functional mechanism may also gain new insight by using knowledge-based approaches employed in this study. new approaches will be required to target proteins or biochemical pathways with proteins in the swapped conformation. insights obtained from our disease ontology analysis indicates that 3D domain swapping is not just confined to neurodegenerative diseases, proteins in swapped conformation play a significant role in several other classes of diseases like cancer, vascular disease, pulmonary disease etc. 3D domain swapping is a functionally relevant phenomenon due to its primary role in protein oligomerization. proteins with swapped oligomeric states are being identified on a regular basis using crystallography experiments. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors thanks NCBS (TIFR) for financial and infrastructural support."}
