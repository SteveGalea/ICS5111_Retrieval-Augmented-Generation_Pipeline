{"summary": "vaginal infections can present with erythema, oedema, itchiness, burning, pain and vaginal discharge. BV, aerobic vaginitis (AV) and candidiasis are the most common infections in women of childbearing age. pathogens responsible for vaginal infections include bacteria, fungi and protozoa. vaginal candidiasis is associated with vaginal discomfort, irritation, vulvar burning, dyspareunia and dysuria. acute pruritus and smelly vaginal discharge are usual complains in vaginal candidiasis. the common therapeutic strategy for vaginal infections is an antibiotic treatment [6], [10], [11] in vitro study, we firstly assessed the antimicrobial activity of a novel organic sucrose octasulfate silver salt against vaginal pathogens isolated from clinical cases of human symptomatic vaginitis. we tested the antimicrobial properties of an innovative vaginal gel (SilSOS Femme) containing IASOS among the active ingredients. the IASOS IASOS antimicrobial activity was tested by the microtiter plate method. each liquid medium was adjusted to pH values of 4, 4.5, 5 and 5.5 by the addition of HCl or NaOH as needed, and then autoclaved. the vaginal pathogens were sub-cultured three times at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. IASOS Microbiocidal and microbiostatic assays were performed in triplicates. one volume of each 24-h cultured pathogen was mixed into a tube with one volume of fresh broth at pH 5 supplemented with IASOS. a 3 log reduction from the initial count was taken as a bactericidal activity. cipients but no active ingredients were prepared for comparative analysis. different amounts of SF, I-SF, PL were spread onto the entire surface of 90 mm diameter, 10-ml BHI agar plates. plates containing corresponding amount of Ag+ from IASOS were also run. each experiment was carried out in duplicate and repeated twice. each plate was incubated in the dark at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. plates were evaluated for any sign of growth inhibition around the pathogen spots. each liquid medium was adjusted to pH values of 4, 4.5, 5 and 5.5. the vaginal pathogens to be tested were sub-cultured three times at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. each medium was inoculated with 105 CFU/ml of each pathogen. aqueous gel containing IASOS 100 mg/L (i.e. 100 ppm) was tested on solid agar plates. different amounts of SF, I-SF, PL were spread onto the entire surface of 10ml agar plates, to achieve the final concentration of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/cm2. plates were allowed to solidify, incubated in the dark at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. they were then macroscopically evaluated for opacity of surface growth. the equivalent amount of silver ions contained in 32 mg of SF was tested by dropping directly the IASOS over 1-cm2 area of the agar surface. growth curves obtained in BHI broth at different final silver concentrations and at different starting pH values. each bar represents the mean of 24(OD), across two independent experiments performed in triplicates standard deviation. in BHI broth and at pH 5\u20135.5, C. albicans was significantly inhibited by IASOS concentration corresponding to 50, 150, 200 ppm Ag+. 200 ppm Ag+ induced the highest degree of inhibition (OD: 52%) at pH 5. increasing amounts of gels (mg/cm2) were spread on the surface of agar plates to detect E. coli and C. albicans growth inhibition by translucency. 32 mg/cm2 (i.e. 2080 mg per 90 mm Petri dish) was the lowest concentration capable to affect E. coli and C. albicans surface growth. no antimicrobial activity was detected for I-SF and PL at any mg/cm2. no antimicrobial activity was detected for I-SF and PL at any mg/cm2. I-SF and PL did not inhibit the growth of the pathogens. no differences were observed between the haloes formed by SF, I-SF+Ag+ and PLAg+ for each pathogen. in both BHI and LAPT broth, IASOS resulted effective in inhibiting bacterial growth with an almost complete growth arrest against all the pathogens tested at 50\u2013200 ppm Ag+. at the lowest silver ion concentrations (10\u201325 ppm Ag+), microbial strains were also differentially inhibited in growth. HI this dose was completely ineffective. a starting pH value of 5 was chosen to mimic the vaginal environment typical of many bacterial infections. IASOS produced a biocidal activity against the tested bacteria. IASOS SF I-SF PL 1 mg/cm2 (65 mg) 6.5 g 2 mg/cm2 (130 mg) 13 g +/ 4 mg/cm2 (260 mg) 26 g +/ 8 mg/cm2 (520 mg) 104 g +/ 32 mg/cm2 (2080 mg) + 208 g ++ *pathogen surface growth: completely opaque and equal to controls. plates spotted with IASOS or SF were run in parallel, at an equivalent amount of silver ions (Ag+) as per those contained in 32 mg of gel. differences induced by IASOS and SF in the boundaries and size of inhibition haloes were observed among the various pathogens. microbiocidal and/or microbiostatic properties were studied in three different concentrations of silver ions (50, 100 and 200 mg/L) all the three concentrations displayed a bactericidal action against all the bacteria tested. a fungistatic effect could be observed against C. albicans. organic matter and salts present in the culture media could interfere on the antimicrobial activity of silver ions because of their propensity to form complexes with silver ions. differences were limited to a lower antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT. ionic silver was the most sensitive to IASOS activity in both media and for all pH tested (MBC = 10 mg/L ionic silver) ionic silver was the most sensitive to IASOS activity in both media and for all pH tested (MBC = 10 mg/L ionic silver) in our experimental conditions we could not find the minimal concentration totally inhibiting growth of C. albicans. microbial membranes are damaged by silver-generated free radicals. this suggests that the vaginal gel could be less effective than the corresponding amount of Ag+ from IASOS. this suggests that all other SF ingredients but IASOS do not exert antimicrobial activity. KSOS and HYA may synergize IASOS\u2019s antimicrobial activity through their antiadhesion properties [36]. in vitro results highlight the antimicrobial activity of IASOS against vaginal pathogens."}
