{"summary": "noise levels in emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) are measured over about three days. the noise levels in an ICU range from 54 to 56 dBA. the noise levels in a patient room are found to be 47 dBA. there is no building legislation for Korean hospitals in terms of reverberation time, but other countries have building regulations. noise levels were measured in emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) in Seoul, Korea, for four days in 2017. questionnaire was distributed throughout the hospital in late November 2017, a month prior to the measurement campaign. the questionnaire basically asked to rank the noise sources, and how severe the noise and acoustics-related problems are. the noisiest room and the worst room in terms of room acoustics were asked and rated on a 5-point scale. otorhinolaryngology 2 0.5 63.7 Reception, internal medicine 3 0.2 62.2 Reception, children hospital 4 0.2 67.0 Main reception Patient room Single 0.3 37 Unoccupied, door & window closed Single 0.3 50 Unoccupied, window open/door closed Multiple 0.2 47 Occupied, door open/door closed. sound level meters were installed with logging function on for three days. at an operating room, background noise level, noise levels during three ear surgeries, and early decay time were measured. the dimensions were 5.8 m9.4 m 3.5 m (H) at an examination room, the background noise, noise during examinations, and the reverberation time (T20) were measured. some reverberation time measurements did not completely comply with ISO 3382 precision method [21] mainly due to the limited time permitted and small room size. for the same reason, T20 was chosen to be reported with some exceptions of EDTs at lower frequencies of 125 and 250 Hz. 0.1 49.2 Background noise Examination room 1 2 55-65 - Nurse station 1 0.5 58.0 Nurse station near patient ward 2 0.5 64.1 Reception area in nurse station 3 0.3 61.5 Preparation room, sterilizer off 4 0.1 62.4 Preparation room, sterilizer off 5 0.5 61.5 Open waiting area, children hospital 6 0.2 62.2 Open waiting area, children hospital 2 Reception 1 0.2 56.6 Reception, otorhinolaryngology 2 0.5 63.7 photos of ERs (A: sectional plan, B: a triage area) and ICUs (C: a treatment area, D: corriodor). in other rooms, we measured noise and reverberation characteristics for less than an hour at each measurement position. background noise level, noise levels during three ear surgeries, and early decay time (EDT) were measured. the noise level and the reverberation time were measured in an empty state. the other was a large room for 8 patients, and only the noise level with in an occupied state was measured. the noisy room rankings are shown in Fig. 4A. the noise level in the treatment ER was measured to be 54.5, 53.9, and 52.4 dBA for the same time intervals. for the first 22 hours, the noise level was quite high as 65.7 dBA, with several intervals with LCpeak of 112.4 dBC. the second surgery was a canal wall down mastoidectomy, where large drills and suctions were used. the average noise level was 59.3, 62.5, and 57.4 dBA. the background noise was measured to be 49.2 dBA. receptions were not ranked as a noisy or acoustically problematic room in the questionnaire. in the single patient room, the background noise level with all doors and windows closed was 37 dBA. in the single patient room, the background noise level went up to 50 dBA. the noisiest room was answered to be office/ nurse stations, followed by corridors, patient rooms, and examination rooms. office/nurse stations are again rated worst in terms of acoustics, followed by corridors, patient rooms, and corridors. for the first 22 hours, the noise level was quite high as 65.7 dBA, with several intervals with LCpeak of 112.4 dBC. for the next 15 hours, the noise level went down to 56.2 dBA. the third day data were lost for unknown reasons. the noise level at the nurse station ranged 58-64 dBA in several measurements near wards, examination rooms, and children department. the highest level measured was 64.1 dBA at a nurse station that also functions as a reception. the second highest value, 62.4 dBA was measured at a preparation room when a sterilizer is running. the noise level in the ICU at SNUH ranges from 56.2 to 65.7 dBA. noise by surgical drills and suctions in the operating room, 52.4, 59.3, and 62.5 dBA, were much lower than in most previous studies. this difference can be due to improved surgical devices over recent decades. noise levels were measured in ERs, ICUs, examination rooms, operating rooms, nurse stations, receptions, and patient rooms. noise levels were measured in an operation room, examination room, and single patient room. the noise levels at the nurse stations and reception areas were quite high."}
