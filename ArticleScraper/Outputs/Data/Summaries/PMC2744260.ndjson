{"summary": "33 porcine samples were confirmed as positive for PEDV by reverse transcription\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) (4) before virus isolation. published primers (5) were used for generating the PEDV 651-bp partial S gene. products were purified by using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) kornpathom (W) FJ196175/FJ196206 11 08CB03 2008 Jan Chonburi (E) FJ196168/FJ196199 12 08NP05 2008 Feb Nakornpathom (W) FJ196176/FJ196207 13 08RB04 2008 Feb Ratchaburi (W) FJ196185/FJ196216 14 08CB04 2008 Feb Chonburi (W) FJ196186/FJ196216 16 08RB06 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the 33 PEDV isolates were aligned, edited, and analyzed with ClustalX version 1.83, Bioedit version 7.0.5.2, and MegAlign software (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA) all recent PEDV isolates in Thailand had 99.3%\u2013100% nucleotide homology. the lowest sequence identity (95.7%) was with the Korean strain, Chinju99. the highest sequence identity of the S gene (98.6%) was with the Chinese strain, JS-2004-2. three major clusters based on the phylogenetic relation of the nucleotide sequences of the M gene were detected. the recent Thai PEDV isolates clustered in the same group were highly homologous with the Chinese strains, JS-2004-2 and LJB/03. they were responsible for the recent PED outbreak in Thailand and able to produce pathologic effects similar to the Chinese isolates. phylogenetic trees generated on basis of nucleotide of the M gene region (A) and the partial S gene region (B) trees constructed with neighbor-joining method by using neighbor-joining method."}
