{"summary": "the 2014\u20132015 west africa outbreak of EVD claimed the lives of more than 11 000 people and infected over 27 000 across seven countries. one entry into the human population is thought responsible for all cases seen. traditional Ebola treatment centres were often large purpose-built facilities with sizeable medical and nursing teams that undertook long-term EVD care for confirmed patients with EVD. these were often operated by international organisations with independent supply chains, and usually had a smaller distinct area for isolation and testing of suspect patients. KSLP is one of six UK academic health science centres. aims to strengthen the health system across a number of domains. KSLP was invited by MOHS to contribute to the national Ebola case management Taskforce. the original protocols for these units were adapted from pre-existing WHO international guidelines on EVD. KSLP and MOHS increased Connaught Hospital bed capacity to 9, then to 16 beds with two child cots. all patients were screened for EVD at the entrance and directed as appropriate to the general wards, outpatient clinics or the EHU. treatment, encouragement and assistance to eat and drink, regular assessment of hydration and clinical status, and symptomatic pain and sickness relief. this allows for the essential continuation of paediatric vaccination, maternal and child health, HIV and tuberculosis programmes and general medical and emergency surgical care within the hospitals. KSLP established a Western Area Ebola Response Centre on 8 September 2014. this coordinated the transfer of suspect cases from the community and from facilities already at capacity into EHUs. it communicated laboratory results with facilities, synchronised transfers of confirmed patients with EVD to treatment centres or burial teams, and informed relevant surveillance networks. start-up times were rapid, with average lead times of 1 week for units to become operational (see table 1). staffing was in the main performed by local HCWs and cleaners, though Connaught Hospital received more support in terms of international staffing and operational input than the other units. the 2014\u20132015 west africa outbreak of EVD claimed the lives of more than 11 000 people and infected over 27 000 across seven countries. EVD had infected under 2500 people in 30 outbreaks since its discovery in 1976. versions of these models were used throughout affected countries in west africa during the EVD response. none of these models were intended to work in isolation. the ideal response to an EVD outbreak with an exponential increase in cases is flexible, readily deployable, and replicable. KSLP is one of six UK academic health science centres. aims to strengthen the health system across a number of domains. aims to strengthen the health system across a number of domains. all patients were screened for EVD at the entrance and directed as appropriate to the general wards, outpatient clinics or the EHU. the EHUs isolated screened or referred suspect patients, provided initial clinical care, undertook laboratory testing to confirm EVD status, referred positive cases to an ETC or negative cases to the general wards, and safely stored corpses pending collection by burial teams. the MOHS had overall strategic leadership of the EHUs at all times. made buildings or space available for the facility; posting local health workers and cleaning staff; paying hazard pay and staff salaries. KSLP worked with local colleagues to: design and construct the facility; train local staff on safety and patient care; develop local clinical pathways; oversee clinical care and troubleshoot problems. nearly half (45%) of isolated suspects were EVD-positive, with limited discriminatory features seen in cases. a further 1412 patients were tested, and either discharged or entered the general medical system for onward care. KSLP-supported MOHS Ebola Holding Units (EHUs). KSLP-supported MOHS Ebola Holding Units (EHUs) a retrospective cohort study of negative patients discharged from five Ebola Holding Units in western area, Sierra Leone. the model has system-wide benefits. it was much less expensive to adapt existing structures than to build new sites. the model works well within a resilience framework. they can be multifunctional and adaptive, allowing for isolation and screening of other potential outbreaks such as cholera, marburg or Lassa fever. it might not be feasible to manage diseases transmitted through the airborne route. higher staff to patient ratios and more senior supervision would enable higher standards of care to be provided, and indeed this was achieved at some EHUs later in the outbreak. the function of EHUs was largely restricted to medical interventions, with limited involvement in community sensitisation or contact tracing. we believe the model achieved the four goals set out in the introduction above. we believe that the EHU model achieved the four goals set out in the introduction above. we believe that the EHU model achieved the four goals set out in the introduction above. many hospitals without an effective EHU saw high levels of health worker infections. but the infection rate was not eliminated completely in hospitals with an EHU. many health worker infections occurred when health workers provided informal care in the community. but the overall scale of the outbreak would likely have been greater. funding for any response soon starts to dry up once the height of the emergency is over. good command and control can enable a far more effective use of existing resources. for example, maximising the use of existing beds is more effective than building more beds."}
