{"summary": "the CFR is theoretically calculated as a proportion of deaths to infected individuals. but the actual calculation practice involves several technical problems owing to a few epidemiological features. the mild nature of influenza involves multiple steps of bias. a real-time serological study could offer the denominator based on all infected individuals. the seroepidemiological survey is costly and the diagnostic performance of serological testing in relation to the estimation of the CFR has yet to be fully clarified. the real-time estimation of the CFR has to take into account the time delay from illness onset to death. age with the highest estimate among elderly and infants and lowest among school-age children and young adults [15, 16]. fourth, during an early stage of a pandemic, the number of deaths still remains very small. it is fruitful to clarify the minimum number of cases required to determine if the estimated CFR in real time is significantly below a predetermined cut-off value such as 2.0%. from infection to death is independently and identically distributed and denotes the conditional probability density function as f(s) of length s days since infection. the event of death is assumed to be independent of the process of renewal. the estimation procedure of a homogeneous population is discussed in section 3. 2.2. function of the time from infection to death f(s) is known, the number of deaths d(t) is modeled as d ( t ) = p 0 i ( t s ) f ( s ) d s, (2) which can be rewritten as d ( t ) = p exp r ( t t 0 ) 0 exp ( r s ) f ( s ) d s 0 i ( t s) d s = l Q ( r ) i ( t ) = k i ( t ) is the density function of the time from infection to confirmatory diagnosis. h(s) is the density function of the time from infection to confirmatory diagnosis. k(r) represents the moment-generating function given the exponential growth rate r. the number of parameters would have to increase to capture the time variation (e.g., from a single r alone to r 0 and r 1 for two consecutive epidemic phases) the required sample size for estimation would also increase. however, all we have to do to cope with the time dependence is to update (1) and (2) using multiple growth rates and revise (6), accordingly. simulations enables us to estimate the CFR based only on confirmed cases and deaths. the estimation rests on limited epidemiological information as compared to other methods involving additional symptomatic case data. the growth rate of influenza A (H1N1-2009) is estimated as 0.08 [25] and 0.10 per day [18] in Japan and Mexico. the reference values of CFR, p, are set at 0.1%, 0.5%, and 2.0%. the CFR of seasonal influenza is thought to be below 0.1% [27] the proposed method can be extended to a heterogeneous population with differential risks of infection and death, perhaps by age and risk groups. we present the extended model analytically and demonstrate that the above-mentioned approach is directly applicable to a multihost population. we focus on the early stage of a pandemic and ignore the depletion of susceptible individuals during this particular time period. i(t) be the incidence of infection at calendar time t. let t 0 be the time at which an epidemic starts with a single index case. i(t) increase exponentially as follows. the exponential growth rate r quantifies the denominator of the above-mentioned estimator. to estimate r, we analyze the incidence of confirmed cases, c(t) an adjusted calendar time based on known t 0 (i.e., t + t 0), we simplify all the following equations by eliminating t 0. in addition to this adjustment, we discretize both the series of confirmed cases and deaths. the observed dataset is given with discrete time (i.e., daily data), that is, c t = t 1 t c ( x ) d x = k r. the likelihood function is given as follows: L 1 ( r, k ; m t ) = t = 1 T ( k / r ) m t exp ( r t ) exp ( r t ) exp ( r t ) exp ( r t ) exp r ( t 1 ) m t. we jointly estimate three parameters, T, r, and k. the 95% confidence intervals are derived from the profile likelihood. the estimation rests on limited epidemiological information as compared to other methods involving additional symptomatic case data. the CFR of the H1N1-2009 pandemic among all infected individuals is estimated to be smaller than 0.1% [28] we do not examine smaller estimates of the CFR. 0.1% may be most reasonably defined as the lowest cut-off value in practical setting to distinguish a mild influenza strain from severe ones. intervals with the assigned parameters, the CFR of 0.5%, and r = 0.15 per day are gradually narrowed down as the epidemic progresses due to reduced sampling errors. this indicates that the smaller the transmission potential is, the longer the time it would take to obtain a reproducible estimate of the CFR. the coverage probability converges earlier due to smaller sampling errors. the coverage probability appears to be more sensitive to variation in r than that in the CFR value. the proportion of successful simulation runs with the upper 95% confidential interval of CFR (p) falls below specified cut-off values. the proportion of successful simulation runs with the upper 95% confidence interval below the pre-specified cut-off value is shown. p s is the group-specific CFR (e.g., age-specific CFR) among all infected individuals of subgroup s. we use the confirmed coefficient k s, reflecting both the proportion of confirmed cases to all infected individuals of subgroup s and the time delay from infection to confirmatory diagnosis. the confirmed cases are c s ( t ) = k s i s ( t ). the likelihood function to estimate the next-generation matrix may partially account for stochastic dependence structure of the transmission dynamics. let Z represent the history of age-specific confirmed cases from time 0 up to time t 1 and thus, conditions for every future expectation on the past history of the epidemic. let t,s be a random variable which yields an estimate of the CFR of subgroups at day t since the start of an epidemic. 0 T 0 q R s q 0 i q ( t s ) g ( ) d f ( s ) d s d s d t D s ( T ) g ( ) d f ( s ) d s d s d t D s ( T ) g ( ) d f ( s ) d s d s a single simulation run and the joint estimation results of the case fatality ratio and exponential growth rate r is set at 0.15 per day. the epidemic day 0 is the date on which an index case is infected. the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths increase exponentially. the value was calculated as the proportion of successful simulation runs with the 95% confidence intervals that include the assigned CFR value among the total of 1000 simulation runs. the parameter r is the exponential growth rate of infection (per day). the ratio of assigned CFR value relative to the cut-off value is shown. the proportion of successful simulation runs with the upper 95% confidence interval below the pre-specified cut-off value is shown. the parameter r is the exponential growth rate of infection (per day) confirmed cases among subgroup s c s(t) are c s ( t ) = k s i s ( t ) c s ( t ) = k s i s ( t ) c s ( t ) c s ( t ) = k s i s ( t ) c s ( t ) c s ( t ) = the likelihood function to estimate the next-generation matrix may partially account for stochastic dependence structure of the transmission dynamics. let t,s represent the history of age-specific confirmed cases from time 0 up to time t 1. the conditional likelihood function is useful to describe the underlying epidemic dynamics of the heterogeneous population. g () d f ( s ) d s d s d t D s ( T ) s, t D s ( T ) s, t s ( t s ) d f ( s ) d s d s d t D s ( T ) s, t s ( t s ) d s d s d s the success of differentiation of CFR from cut-off values also takes about a few months. the growth rate may not be feasible, if the growth rate is 0.05 per day or smaller. this finding is attributable to the fact that the number of deaths is the result of binominal sampling of cases. a seroepidemiological study may be the only method to explicitly quantify transmission dynamics. a seroepidemiological study may be the only method to directly quantify the underlying transmission dynamics. a seroepidemiological study may be the only method to explicitly and directly quantify the underlying transmission dynamics. the proposed method relies on the observed number of deaths as the numerator of the CFR. if there are many undiagnosed deaths, the direct estimation of the CFR is not feasible. constant k over time is also an unsupported assumption for epidemics with time-varying ascertainment efforts. the proposed method is prone to uncertainties arising from low frequency of infection. the proposed method can be coupled with or supplement existing estimation frameworks."}
