{"summary": "humans have five IFITM loci, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 (1). mice have orthologs of all five human IFITM genes and two additional genes of unknown function: Ifitm6 and Ifitm7 (1). -5, and -6 combined (IfitmDel) are viable and have known deficiencies in the control of influenza in vivo. most murine Ifitm proteins exhibit some degree of viral restriction activity when overexpressed in vitro. only Ifitm3 appears to contribute to the control of influenza in vivo. IFITM proteins consist of a relatively long, hydrophilic N terminus, a conserved region consisting of a hydrophobic helix and cytosolic loop. both helices are palmitoylated, and the palmitoylation is necessary for optimal viral restriction activity (22) these proteins had been predicted to assume a type III, two-pass transmembrane topology with both N and C termini oriented toward the ER lumen or extracellular space. yount et al. (27) also proposed a cytosolic orientation of the IFITM3 C terminus based on the ability of a prenylation reporter to bind an artificial C-terminal CLVL motif. the CLVL mutant was studied only in conjunction with the introduction of an N-terminal myristoylation motif and simultaneous deletion of the palmitoylation sites. the antiviral activity of Ifitm3 in vitro and in vivo is well established. the amino acid sequence is similar to that of human IFITM3 (1). primary antibodies used were anti-Myc clone 9E10, anti-C9 clone 1D4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG clone M2 (Sigma), or mouse IgG1 isotype control clone P3.6.2.8.1 (eBioscience). secondary staining was performed with Alexa Fluor 488- or 633-labeled secondary antibodies of goat origin (Life Technologies). permeabilization experiments were performed using the FIX & PERM kit reagents (Life Technologies) at 1:1 and 1:3 dilutions in PBS, respectively, for 15 min each at room temperature. cells were fixed with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone for 10 min at 20 \u00b0C. m-filtered supernatants containing 5 g/ml Polybrene at 4000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then returned to the 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h. 24 h later, cells were harvested by trypsinization. secondary staining was performed with Alexa Fluor 488- or 633-labeled secondary antibodies of goat origin (Life Technologies) to assess membrane integrity, cells were incubated for 10 min on ice in the presence of 1 g/ml propidium iodide. Flow cytometry was performed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) cDNA was obtained from the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core. Myc-tagged Ifitm3 was stained with clone 9E10 or 9E11, C9 tag was stained with clone 1D4, and FLAG-tagged Sptlc1 was stained with clone M2. -Tubulin was detected with polyclonal rabbit antibodies. eGFP-positive cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. cells were transduced with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped retrovirus particles. Western Blots Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. peptide-N-glycosidase digestion was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. tubulin was stained with mouse clone SAP.4G5 (Sigma) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse. Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated antibodies of goat origin were used for secondary fluorescence staining. slides were coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade medium with DAPI. 16-bit grayscale images were pseudocolored, windowed, leveled, and composited. retrovirus genomes were derived from vector pQCXIP (Clontech) containing variants of Ifitm3. transduced cells were selected with either 2 g/ml puromycin (293T) or 4 g/ml puromycin (MEF) tubulin was stained with mouse clone SAP.4G5 (Sigma) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) images were captured at 16-bit depth using an LAS4000 mini chemiluminescence reader (GE Healthcare) retroviruses encoding eGFP were prepared as described previously (29) using the indicated viral entry proteins. envelope proteins included hemagglutinins derived from influenza virus A/Thailand/2(SP-33)/2004 (H5), neuraminidase from influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (N1), and glycoproteins from vesicular stomatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis cells expressing N- or C-terminal FLAG-tagged Ifitm3 were stained by indirect immunofluorescence. PI is a membrane-impermeant, nucleic acid-binding dye with a molecular mass of 0.7 kDa. PI-negative cells, therefore, are cells whose membranes are intact. expression levels of wild type and N- and C-terminally FLAG-tagged Ifitm3 were determined by Western blot with an antibody against the native Ifitm3 N terminus. e, total expression of the constructs was determined by Western blot with an antibody against the native Ifitm3 N terminus. eGFP gating could isolate populations of intact eGFP+ or eGFP cells. we could distinguish cells expressing tagged Ifitm3 (Ifitm3+/eGFP) or acquiring Ifitm3 from neighboring cells (Ifitm3/eGFP+) m3/eGFP+ cells were cultured separately from Ifitm3+/eGFP cells. the amount of FLAG acquired was minor, however, and not appreciably different from the amount transferred by simply mixing cells prior to staining. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of extracellular epitopes at the plasma membrane. MEFs expressing either Myc-Ifitm3 or Ifitm3-C9 were fixed and then either permeabilized with detergent or left with membranes intact prior to indirect immunofluorescence. ifitm3 was exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, a C-terminal KDEL motif would block egress of Ifitm3 from the ER lumen. cells were stained for both Myc (Ifitm3) and FLAG (Sptlc1) epitopes. a combination of cytoplasmic puncta and plasma membrane staining showed identical localization patterns. Ifitm3-KDEL co-localized nearly entirely with the ER marker. lysates from MEFs expressing an N- and C-terminally tagged Ifitm3 (myc-Ifitm3-C9) were examined with staining for the indicated epitopes. the plasma membrane is yellow/orange, indicating co-localization of the two epitopes (full-length Myc-Ifitm3-C9) C-terminal LEDK- and REDI-tagged Ifitm3 showed a double band pattern on Western blot. the ER-sequestered mutant, however, showed no evidence of C-terminal cleavage. we hypothesized that the Ifitm3 C terminus was exposed to the degradative interior of the lysosome. C-terminal tags interfered with eGFP-encoding retroviruses. transduced MEFs were then infected with eGFP-encoding retroviruses. bars show proportion of percentage of infected cells expressing each Ifitm3 construct relative to percentage of infected vector-transduced cells. cells effectively localized FLAG-TM2-C9 to the plasma membrane. TM2 clearly functions as a signal anchor, consistent with a transmembrane orientation of the second hydrophobic region of Ifitm3. the second hydrophobic region of Ifitm3 acts as a signal anchor sequence. surface staining of CD5SP/FLAG-tagged Ifitm3 and CD5SP/C9-tagged Ifitm3 showed that the CD5 signal peptide effectively reorient the N terminus toward the extracellular space. the addition of a signal peptide to the Ifitm3 N terminus mimics a type III topology. yount et al. (27) previously noted a lack of N-linked glycosylation on an NHT motif on the wild type N terminus of IFITM3 (residues 2\u20134, conserved in mouse) but the addition of the CD5SP provided a positive control to determine whether or not this motif was accessible to the cellular glycosylation machinery. cell lines from HEK 293T cells and Ifitm knock-out murine embryonic fibroblasts (IfitmDel MEFs) expressing epitope-tagged Ifitm3 were stained by indirect immunofluorescence. both N-terminal and C-terminal FLAG tags could be detected on the surface of PI 293T cells. a new tab FLAG-tagged Ifitm3 N and C termini can be detected at the surface of intact cells. to confirm staining of only extracellular FLAG antigen, PI-positive cells were excluded from analysis. fluorescence staining from the isotype control is shown in red. in Fig. 3B, we show both PI-positive and PI-negative 293T cells plotted against the forward and side scatter axes. intact (PI) and permeabilized (PI+) 293T cells could be clearly distinguished on the basis of scatter gating alone. by scatter gating followed by eGFP gating, we could isolate populations of intact eGFP+ or eGFP cells. Ifitm3/eGFP+ cells were co-cultured with Ifitm3+/eGFP cells for 18 h prior to flow cytometry. in the second, Ifitm3/eGFP+ cells acquired FLAG epitope from their Ifitm3+/eGFP counterparts. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of extracellular epitopes at the plasma membrane. al Myc staining was equally intense in both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells. we conclude that Ifitm3 N termini are intracellular but that the C termini are mostly or entirely extracellular. MEFs stably expressing these Ifitm3 mutants were transduced a second time with FLAG-tagged Sptlc1 (FLAG-Sptlc1) to serve as an ER marker. cells were stained for both Myc (Ifitm3) and FLAG (Sptlc1) epitopes. lysates from MEFs expressing an N- and C-terminally tagged Ifitm3 (myc-Ifitm3-C9) were examined by Western blot with staining for the indicated epitopes. lysates from MEFs expressing an N- and C-terminally tagged Ifitm3 (myc-Ifitm3-C9) were examined. the plasma membrane is yellow/orange, indicating co-localization of the two epitopes. the C9 tag remained intact within the enlarged vacuoles that accompany IFITM protein overexpression. assay using virus-like particles pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of a robustly Ifitm3-restricted virus (influenza A virus H5N1) and a weakly restricted virus (vesicular stomatitis virus), and two Ifitm3-insensitive controls. C-terminal tags interfered with neither Ifitm3 function nor expression levels. we transduced cells with these constructs and analyzed surface expression of the epitope tags. TM2 clearly functions as a signal anchor, consistent with a transmembrane orientation of the second hydrophobic region of Ifitm3. a minority population of Ifitm3 molecules with extracellular N termini led us to investigate this rare topology. the addition of a signal peptide to the Ifitm3 N terminus mimics a type III topology. a signal peptide derived from CD5 (CD5SP) effectively reorients the N terminus toward the extracellular space. s expressing C9-tagged Ifitm3 with or without a CD5 signal peptide. peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) were treated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) or mock-treated as indicated. localization of Ifitm3 N and C Termini to the Extracellular Space We first determined whether N- or C-terminal epitope tags added to Ifitm3 could be detected extracellularly at the plasma membrane. we included critical controls to rule out potential artifactual positive results. the results were not specific to the FLAG epitope; the same staining pattern was observed in both cell lines when the FLAG tags were replaced by Myc and C9 on the N and C termini, respectively. eGFP fluorescence spilled over into the PI channel, complicating our ability to identify intact cells by vital staining. intact (PI) and permeabilized (PI+) 293T cells could be effectively identified by morphology (i.e. forward and side scatter gating) alone. cells expressing either FLAG-Ifitm3 or Ifitm3-FLAG were co-cultured with Ifitm3/eGFP+ cells for 18 h (top panels) or mixed with Ifitm3/eGFP+ cells immediately prior to surface staining (bottom panels) ing for primarily intracellular epitopes would show a marked increase in intensity following permeabilization. co-staining was performed with an antibody against the cytoskeletal protein, -tubulin. with permeabilization, however, intense plasma membrane staining was observed. if the Ifitm3 C terminus were oriented toward the ER lumen, a C-terminal KDEL motif would block egress of Ifitm3 from the ER. as controls, we created two additional Ifitm3 mutants. one was terminated with the reverse motif (LEDK), and the other was terminated with a similar charge and hydrophobicity (REDI) lysates from MEFs expressing an N- and C-terminally tagged Ifitm3 (myc-Ifitm3-C9) were examined by Western blot with staining for the indicated epitopes. the brightness of this panel was adjusted independently to better visualize its co-localization with Sptlc1. Ifitm3-LEDK- and REDI-tagged Ifitm3 showed a double band pattern. the ER-sequestered KDEL mutant showed no evidence of C-terminal cleavage. the cleavage event occurred outside of the ER. C-terminal tags interfere with the topology of the Ifitm3. we performed a viral entry assay using virus-like particles pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of a robustly Ifitm3-restricted virus. both predicted transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) would function as signal anchor sequences. if it were a type II protein, only one of the two domains should be recognized as a signal anchor. if it were a type II protein, however, only one of the two domains should be recognized as a signal anchor. TM2-C9 but not FLAG-IM1-C9 could be detected by flow cytometry. permeabilized cells were excluded from analysis by PI gating. analysis of forced transmembrane topology Mutant of Ifitm3. the N terminus of Ifitm3 can be glycosylated but is not normally accessible to cellular glycosylation machinery. cells were transfected (293T) or transduced (MEF, bottom) with constructs expressing C9-tagged Ifitm3 with or without a CD5 signal peptide (CD5-SP) and with or without introduction of an additional NGT motif (+NGT (51\u201353) SP-Ifitm3 was inefficiently glycosylated, but the NGT insertion was fully glycosylated. no corresponding peptide-N-glycosidase F-sensitive bands were noted for constructs lacking a signal peptide. both N-terminal and C-terminal FLAG tags could be detected on the surface of PI 293T cells. staining of the Ifitm3 N terminus was very weak despite a robust signal for the C terminus. the surface staining observed in Fig. 2 was the result of adherent cellular debris deposited on the plasma membrane. eGFP fluorescence spilled over into the PI channel, complicating our ability to identify intact cells by vital staining. intact 293T cells (blue) could be clearly distinguished from cells with compromised membrane integrity (red) by scatter gating alone. cells were further sorted based on eGFP expression. cells expressing either FLAG-Ifitm3 or Ifitm3-FLAG were co-cultured. Flow cytometry cannot exclude the possibility of intracellular epitopes at this location. staining for primarily intracellular epitopes would show a marked increase in intensity following permeabilization. staining for primarily extracellular epitopes should be equally bright under both conditions. the Ifitm3 C terminus was exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. we created an N-terminally Myc-tagged Ifitm3 with the addition of a C-terminal GSSG linker and a KDEL motif. a C-terminal KDEL motif would block egress of Ifitm3 from the ER. the addition of a C-terminal KDEL motif to Myc-Ifitm3 results in its retention in the ER. top panels show staining of cells expressing Ifitm3 with or without the indicated C-terminal additions. Western blot examined tagged Ifitm3 (myc-Ifitm3-C9) with staining for indicated epitopes. dotted lines indicate sites of reassembly of the membrane after staining. lysosomal acid hydrolase activity prevented degradation of the Ifitm3 C terminus. fluorescence microscopy for the Myc-Ifitm3-C9 construct revealed that the C-terminal degradation occurred in punctate cytoplasmic structures consistent with lysosomes. expression levels of the constructs were determined by Western blot against the native Ifitm3 N terminus. if Ifitm3 were a type III transmembrane protein, both predicted transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) would function as signal anchor sequences. /transmembrane domains were subcloned from Ifitm3. 293T cells or MEFs expressing these constructs were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for both tags. FLAG-TM2-C9 but not FLAG-TM1-C9 could be detected by flow cytometry. e were stained for appropriate epitopes and analyzed by flow cytometry. western blot shows relative expression of each construct in 293T cells. peptide-N-glycosidase F removed N-linked glycosylation of the N terminus. peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion of the cell lysate was ineffectively glycosylated. the N terminus is inserted into the ER lumen and degraded within the interior of the lysosome. Ifitm3 contains an extracellular C terminus and cytosolic N terminus. lines of evidence from this study are listed next to the N and C termini of the molecule. us consists of a single residue (Arg-104) and its TM2 may therefore be relatively poorly anchored. the presence of this alternate topology is probably not relevant to the restriction activity of Ifitm3."}
