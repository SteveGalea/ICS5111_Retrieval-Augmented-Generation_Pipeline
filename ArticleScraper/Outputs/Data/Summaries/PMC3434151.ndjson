{"summary": "studies of the association between the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene and HIV-1 susceptibility have produced controversial results. the findings demonstrate that the VNTR polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene is associated with a moderate effect on host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. up to now, nearly 34 million people suffered from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. an estimated 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus in 2010. the natural course of HIV-1 infection and the susceptibility to infection after exposure are highly heterogeneous among individuals [1], [2]. DC-SIGNR is a homolog of DC-SIGN with 77% amino acid identity and preferential expression in liver and lymph node epithelial cells. DC-SIGNR functions similarly to DC-SIGNR in capturing HIV-1 and enhancing HIV-1 infection of T cells by HIV-1. meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between the VNTR polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. we also performed a stratified analysis by ethnicity and sample size to explore the variation in the relationship between VNTR polymorphism and HIV-1 infection risk among different ethnic populations. Statistical Analyses ORs with 95% CI were calculated to assess the association between VNTR polymorphism in the DC-SIGNR gene and HIV-1 susceptibility. in the primary analysis, an allelic association test was performed for the prevalent alleles, which represented the four most prevalent alleles in human population. to correct for multiple testing for these 4 alleles, a Bonferroni correction was also applied to determine the corrected p-value. a high heterogeneity is considered present when I2>50% and much higher when I2>75% [27] the pooled OR was calculated by a fixed effect model. the statistical significance of OR was analyzed by the Z test. studies were excluded if they did not contain enough data for meta-analysis. authors perused papers and extracted the data according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. data was collected from eligible studies. the other genotypes, (5) the 6/7 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (6) the 7/9 genotype vs. the other genotypes, (6) the 7/9 genotype vs. the other genotypes. no Bonferroni correction was performed in this stage. a total of 115 results were identified after an initial search from the selected electronic databases. 40 articles were selected for further review. a total of 10 studies were suitable for meta-analysis [13]\u2013[18], [20]\u2013[23]. HESN, HIV-exposed seronegative individuals. the value of X2 was 9.52 with 7 degrees of freedom. p was 0.22 in a fixed effect model (Figure 2A) the association between 5-repeat allele had a corrected P value of 0.05. in the genetic models, we analyzed the heterogeneity of 5/5 vs. the other genotypes by using the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative samples subjects. a summary of the results of all the comparisons with different genetic models was listed in Table S1. for ethnicity, the studies were divided into two subgroups, one subgroup of Asian descendants (7 studies) and the other subgroup of European-American descendants (2 studies). the comparison was carried out between the HIV-1 patients and the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) samples under the allelic risk model of 5/5 vs. other genotypes. for sample size, the studies were stratified into two subgroups, one comprising studies with more than 200 subjects. risk model of 5-repeat allele vs. other genetic models did not reveal significant results. a total of 115 results were identified after an initial search from the selected electronic databases. a total of 10 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. in the 10 eligible studies was 5946, which included 2683 HIV-1 patients and 3263 controls (2130 healthy controls and 1133 HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls) the characteristics of each study are listed in Table 1. Figure 1. Flow diagram of the study selection for the meta-analysis. using the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) samples as controls, the value of X2 was 8.84 with 6 degrees of freedom, and p was 0.18. the pooled OR was significant at 0.84 (95% CI = 0.73\u20130.96, p = 0.01, Figure 2B) the Bonferroni corrected P-value was 0.05. we analyzed the heterogeneity of 5/5 vs. the other genotypes by using the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative samples subjects (HESN) as controls. the results indicated a low to moderate heterogeneity (X2 = 7.09, I2 = 29%, p = 0.21) the fixed effect model was then used to synthesize the data. the 5-repeat allele presented the trend of having the protective effect among Asian (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71\u20131.00, p = 0.05, Pheterogeneity = 0.20 and I2 = 33%). the sample size of the Asian population in present study was not large enough to achieve enough statistical power. p = 0.03) was found in the subgroup with a sample size of more than 200 subjects, but not in the subgroup with less than 200 subjects (Table S2). publication bias Publication bias was assessed by Begg's test and Egger's test (data not shown) in the total population and all the subgroups. both the Begg's test (p = 0.462) and the Egger's test (p = 0.215) did not present any significantly statistical evidence of the strength of the present analysis is based on the accumulation of published data. using different genetic models, we could preliminarily estimate the effect of the allele frequency, genotype frequency, and homozygous proportion. the protective effect was most predominant in HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. the association between the DC-SIGNR VNTR polymorphism and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection has not been fully explored. results of this meta-analysis suggest that the DC-SIGNR VNTR polymorphism had an impact on host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may influence host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may influence host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. this is first meta-analysis to assess the relationship between the DC-SIGNR polymorphism and HIV-1 infection risk. ethnic populations and with clear infection routes should be performed to evaluate these associations.
