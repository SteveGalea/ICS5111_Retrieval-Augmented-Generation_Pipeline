{"summary": "interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) were identified as potent inhibitors of different viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), west Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. human and mouse IFITM3 have been studied with regard to their antiviral potential but also their mechanisms of viral restriction. swine and human IFITM2 and IFITM3 share an N-terminal extension of about 20 amino acids that contains the endocytosis motif YEML. this alignment suggests that the swine IFITMs may have antiviral properties similar to those of their human counterparts. affl method (24) using swine GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) mRNA as reference. error bars representing 95% confidence interval. swIFITM1a, swIFITM1b, swIFITM2 and swIFITM3 were induced less than 3-fold in NpTr cells. swine MX1 and swine OAS, both known to be upregulated by IFN, displayed only low levels of swIFITM induction. we transfected human A549, swine NpTr, or swine NSK cells with constructs encoding flag-tagged human or swine IFITMs. IFITMs were stained using an antibody against the Flag tag, while late endosomes were marked using an antibody recognizing LBPA (20). swIFITM1a and -1b localizing predominantly to the plasma membrane but with swIFITM2 and -3 accumulating IFITMs were stained using an antibody against the Flag epitope (red) late endosomes using an antibody against the late endosome marker LBPA. cell nuclei were marked using DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to evaluate the antiviral potential of swIFITMs, we performed an IAV reporter assay with cells transiently transfected with the different swIFITMs. the reporter plasmid encodes luciferase in complementary reverse orientation flanked by IAV noncoding regions. this assay provides the advantage that only reporter activity from transfected cells is measured, enabling us to assess the impact of the different IFITMs on IAV in a transient expression of swIFITMs potently inhibits IAV. hek293-T (A) and NpTr (B) cells were transfected with an IAV-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and firefly luciferase activity was measured. at 48 h p.i., supernatants were harvested and viral titers determined via plaque assay on MDCK cells. expression levels of swIFITMs were confirmed by Western blotting. swIFITM2 was the most potent, with reducing titers of around 1,000-fold. we were not able to generate stable NpTr cell lines expressing high levels of swIFITM3 and -5 (Fig. 3E and D) swIFITM2 showed the most potent antiviral activity. cells were either mock treated or treated with universal type I IFN. knockdown of swIFITM had no effect on virus titers. in IFN-treated cells, viral titers were increased by 10-fold. FITMs constitute an important part of the IFN response against IAV in porcine cells. at 36 h posttransfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with universal type I IFN (1,000 U/ml) at 12 h posttreatment, cells were either left untreated or treated with universal type I IFN (1,000 U/ml) swIFITM1 to -3 are upregulated by type I IFN and IAV infection in porcine PK-15 and NSK cells. swIFITM2 and swIFITM3 display the strongest antiviral activities."}
