{"summary": "influenza pandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel triple reassortant influenza virus, A(H1N1)pdm2009, which first emerged in pigs in pigs in Mexico but spread rapidly across the globe. asthma was the most common comorbidity among patients hospitalized with influenza during this pandemic. phenotypes of infectious diseases on animal model may differ slightly from human diseases. existing murine models of asthma with respiratory virus infection have shown influenza viruses are involved in asthma development [11]. however, other murine models developed to examine the pathogenesis of influenza/allergic asthma show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection. NC/Nga mice are more sensitive to several types of allergic disease/reaction (including allergic airway inflammation) than BALB/c mice [24, 25]. using the mouse model, we have investigated the impact of allergen challenges on lung pathology in the pandemic influenza virus infected mice. mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of morbidity and mortality up to 21 days post infection. the human endpoint was used for mice that lost 25% or more of their initial body weight during the study. six to eight week old female NC/Nga mice were sensitized by two consecutive weekly intraperitoneal injections of 100 g of OVA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight and challenged IN with 20 l of pH1N1 virus. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight and challenged IN with 20 l of pH1N1 virus. on the next day after the second IN challenge with OVA the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine. anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight and challenged IN with 100 g of OVA with or without 800 g of zanamivir (ZAN) the mice were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia on 3 or 21 days. the levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the BALF were measured using the mouse Cytokine Twenty-Plex Antibody Bead Kit. the assays can determine the concentrations of the following 20 cytokines and chemokines in the BALF. histopathology and immunohistochemistry Animals were sacrificed at 3 days or 21 days post-infection. excised lung tissues were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. all the lobes of fixed lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of morbidity and mortality. the human endpoint was used for mice that lost 25% or more of their initial body weight during the study. the virus was grown in the allantoic cavities of 10-to-11-day-old fertile eggs. the number of plaques was counted by crystal violet staining at 2 days post-inoculation. the virus titer was expressed as pfu/ml. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. they challenged IN with 100 g of OVA in 20 l of PBS for 2 consecutive days. mice were inoculated with diluted allantoic fluid lacking virus. the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight and challenged IN with 20 l of pH1N1 virus. the mice were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia on 3 or 21 days (pH1N1-infected mice) after infection and subjected to collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (n = glass slides at 1000 rpm for 10 min using a Shandon cytocentrifuge. the cells were then stained with Giemsa and analyzed by microscopy. the rest of the BALF was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g at 4\u00b0C. immunohistochemistry was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibody for type A influenza nucleoprotein (IAV NP) antigen. peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (EnVision/HRP, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as the secondary antibody. parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test. data considered statistically significant at p0.05. first murine model of allergic airway inflammation was set up. the lungs of pH1N1/PBS mice showed limited inflammation of perivascular alveolar areas. the lungs of Mock/OVA mice also showed mild eosinophilic inflammation around bronchioles while those of Mock/PBS mice remained intact. the difference between the proportions of neutrophils, which is triggered by influenza virus infection, was not significant. weight change data were combined from three (pH1N1 infection groups) or two (Mock groups) independent experiments. data are expressed as scatter plots with the mean viral titer SD. cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection or allergic response are crucial molecules that regulate inflammation processes in the lung. expressions of MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1/CCL3 and IP-10/CXCL10 were significantly higher in pH1N1/OVA and Mock/OVA mice than in Mock/PBS mice. exacerbation of the lung pathology observed in this model may be attributable to synergistic increase of chemokines production induced by both of pre-existing influenza virus infection and subsequent allergic airway inflammation. concentrations of chemokines and cytokines in BALF from mice were measured on day 2 and 3 post-infection (5 mice/group) the mice were infected with a sublethal dose of pH1N1 on the day of the last OVA challenge. inflammation was limited and similar to that in the lungs from the pH1N1-infected mice that were not pre-challenged with OVA. the lungs showed subtle eosinophilic infiltrations around bronchioles, confirming that the allergen challenges in this protocol induced acute allergic airway inflammation. a significant increase in the proportion of neutrophils, which is triggered by influenza virus infection, was observed in the BALF from both OVA/pH1N1 mice or PBS/pH1N1 mice at Day 3 post-infection. the difference between the proportions of neutrophils in OVA challenged mice was not significant at Day 3 post-infection. the levels of IL-5 and IL-13, which are Th2 cytokines, were significantly higher in the BALF of OVA mice. however, they declined after infection (Day 3) regardless of virus infection. a pre-existing acute allergic immune response inhibited the replication of influenza virus, decreased virus-induced cytokine and chemokine production. ers in the BALF were measured in a plaque assay (5 mice/group) data are expressed as scatter plots with the mean viral titer SD. concentrations of chemokines (F), proinflammatory cytokines (G), interferons (H), Th2 cytokines (I) in BALF from influenza virus-infected mice with pre-existing allergic airway inflammation. olar and alveolar epithelium of pH1N1/OVA and pH1N1/PBS mice at Day 3 post-infection. compared to mice not pre-challenged with OVA (PBS/pH1N1), we observed a marked reduction in the amount of influenza virus antigen in the bronchiolar epithelium. pre-existing acute allergic airway inflammation suppressed the influenza virus replication specifically in the bronchiolar airway epithelium influenza virus infection and subsequent induction of acute allergic airway inflammation promote goblet cell metaplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium Asthma. bronchiolar epithelium of control mice was ciliated and cuboidal, and was not stained by Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) the same was true for pH1N1-infected mice not challenged with OVA at Day 21 post-infection. a few PAS-positive epithelial cells were also observed in the bronchioles of pH1N1-infected mice with pre-existing allergic airway inflammation. the difference of the number of PAS-positive cells compared to that of PBS/pH1N1 mice was not statistically significant. the number of PAS-positive cells in the bronchiolar epithelium of OVA/pH1N1 mice was significantly lower than that in pH1N1/ numbers of PAS positive epithelial cells in lung tissues from PBS, OVA, pH1N1/PBS, pH1N1/OVA, PBS/pH1N1 and OVA/pH1N1 were obtained by visual estimation. treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor reduces influenza virus-induced inflammatory responses, but does not inhibit infection of the bronchiolar epithelium or subsequent epithelial metaplasia in influenza virus-infected levels in infected mice not infected with influenza virus (Mock/OVA) were significantly lower than those in infected mice that were not treated with ZAN, again, irrespective of OVA challenge. results suggest that although ZAN treatment reduced influenza virus-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting viral replication, it had no effect on acute allergic airway inflammation. NC/Nga mice were sensitized twice (via the IP route) with OVA (Day -14 and Day -7) and then infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 (pH1N1) or Mock infected with allantoic fluid (Day 0). on the day following infection, mice were administered OVA or PBS with or without 800 g of ZAN (via the IN route) for two consecutive days. numbers of PAS positive epithelial cells in lung tissues from pH1N1-infected/OVA-challenged or pH1N1-infected/PBS-challenged mice (treated or not with ZAN) on day 3 post-infection were obtained by visual estimation over the entire section. the lung tissues of pH1N1/OVA mice showed massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils. by contrast, the lungs of pH1N1/PBS mice showed limited inflammation of perivascular alveolar areas. the lungs of Mock/OVA mice also showed mild eosinophilic inflammation around bronchioles while those of Mock/PBS mice remained intact. NC/Nga mice were sensitized twice by IP injection of OVA on Day -14 and Day -7. on the 2 days following infection, the mice were challenged again with OVA or PBS via the IN route. weight loss was monitored after infection (20 mice in the pH1N1 infection groups and 10 mice in the Mock groups) influenza virus infection and subsequent allergic airway response synergistically enhance chemokine production. expressions of cytokines and chemokines in the BALF of mice were significantly higher in pH1N1/OVA and Mock/OVA mice than in Mock/PBS mice. the levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were significantly higher in Mock/OVA mice. but they were markedly lower in pH1N1/OVA mice than in Mock/OVA mice. the exacerbation of the lung pathology may be attributable to synergistic increase of chemokines production induced by both of pre-existing influenza virus infection and subsequent allergic airway inflammation. mice were first sensitized with OVA by repeated IP injection of OVA with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant. on the day of the last OVA challenge, the mice were infected with a sublethal dose of pH1N1. inflammation was limited and similar to that in the lungs from the pH1N1-infected mice that were not pre-challenged with OVA. a significant increase in the proportion of neutrophils was observed in the BALF from both OVA/pH1N1 mice or PBS/pH1N1 mice at Day 3 post-infection. however, the difference between the proportion of neutrophils was not significant at Day 3 post-infection. expression of IL-6, IL-12, GM-CSF, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- was significantly higher in mice not pre-challenged with OVA. levels of IL-5 and IL-13, which are Th2 cytokines, were significantly higher in the BALF of OVA mice than those of PBS mice before infection (Day 0) eosin (H&E) staining was monitored after infection (10 mice/group). Error bars represent the mean SEM. weight change data were combined from two independent experiments. we performed immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues using an anti-influenza NP antibody to examine the distribution of viral infected cells. we detected similar levels of influenza virus antigens in both the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium of pH1N1/OVA and pH1N1/PBS mice at Day 3 post-infection. by contrast, compared to mice not pre-challenged with OVA (PBS/pH1N1), we observed a representative sections of lung tissue from mice infected with influenza virus followed by induction of allergic airway responses using OVA (pH1N1/OVA) or from mice infected with influenza and subsequently challenged with PBS (pH1N1/PBS) the data are representative of 3 mice/group from two independent experiments. a few PAS-positive epithelial cells were also observed in the bronchioles of pH1N1-infected mice with pre-existing allergic airway inflammation (OVA/pH1N1). the difference of the number of PAS-positive cells in the bronchiolar epithelium was significantly lower than that in pH1N1/OVA mice. the data are representative of 5 to 11 mice/group from three independent experiments. treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor reduces influenza virus-induced inflammatory responses, but does not inhibit infection of the bronchiolar epithelium. levels of MCP-1/CCL2 in the influenza virus-infected mice on day 3 post-infection were significantly lower than those in infected mice that were not treated with ZAN. however, levels in infected mice not infected with influenza virus were not affected by ZAN treatment. NC/Nga mice were sensitized twice (via the IP route) with OVA. mice were then infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 (pH1N1) or Mock infected with allantoic fluid (Day 0). representative PAS-stained sections of lung tissue from pH1N1-infected/OVA-challenged mice obtained on Day 21 post-infection. the data are expressed as scatter plots with the mean SD of results for 5 to 10 mice/group from two independent experiments. comorbidity show seemingly contradictory findings [11\u201314, 32\u201334]. some models demonstrate that influenza virus infection plays a role in inducing asthma development and increases airway sensitization during the acute phase of infection. others show that acute allergic airways are resistant to influenza virus infection. asthmatic model mice showed significant weight loss after influenza virus infection. virus-infected mice in which acute allergic airway inflammation was not induced developed less severe weight loss. this is the most important clinical sign of deterioration when assessing the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection. airway remodeling is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of asthma. asthmatic patients show an increase in the number of goblet cells. goblet cell metaplasia is not caused by the proliferation of pre-existing goblet cells. influenza virus infection induces bronchial epithelial regeneration with the formation of a nonkeratinizing stratified squamous metaplasia. some recent reports indicate that acutely allergic airways are highly resistant to influenza virus infection. a novel murine model of asthma and influenza comorbidity was produced. we found that influenza virus infection followed by induction of allergic airway responses in asthmatic mice led to an exacerbation of lung pathology. pre-existing allergic airway inflammation protected from subsequent influenza virus infection."}
