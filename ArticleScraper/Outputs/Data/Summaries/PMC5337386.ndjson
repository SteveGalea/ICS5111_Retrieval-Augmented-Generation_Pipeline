{"summary": "acute cerebellitis is an inflammatory process in the cerebellum. the clinical manifestations consist of mild or high-grade fever, headache, altered mental state, and acute onset of cerebellar symptoms. the etiology of acute cerebellitis is usually viral. blood tests revealed white blood count: 9350/mm3 with neutrophil predominance (68%); hemoglobin: 11,4 g/dL; platelet counts: 251.000/mm3, C- reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL; sedimentation rate: 21 mm/h. blood tests revealed white blood count: 9350/mm3 with neutrophil predominance (68%); truncal titubation, dysmetria. the patient was diagnosed with influenza-associated cerebellitis based on the clinical findings. the patient's fever and vomiting regressed, but his intermittent hallucinations and ataxic gait continued. after the immunglobulin therapy, the patient improved. acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) is described as a clinical syndrome of acute onset of cerebellar dysfunction, with good long-term prognosis. ACA must be differentiated from tumor, abscess, polyneuritis, intoxication, metabolic disease, hereditary degenerative disorders, meningitis, encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. in etiological studies of encephalitis, influenza A and/or influenza B have been identified in up to 10% of pediatric patients [21], while another study by Khandaker et al. showed 9.7% of all children admitted with influenza had neurological complications. other neurologic manifestations of influenza are quite varied such as febrile seizures, myositis, cerebellitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and Guillain-Barre Syndrom/Fisher initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed increased intensity on T2W and flair sequences of the cerebellar gray matter. MRI showed a high signal lesion in the cerebellar cortex Pleocytosis Oseltamivir Truncal ataxia normalized after 3 months 2010. a case of a 31-year-old woman with high serum hemagglutination inhibition titer to influenza B and positive CSF polymerase chain reaction [PCR] for influenza B nucleoprotein gene in cerebrospinal fluid. there are reports that present query AC cases with cerebellar signs, where viral RNA cannot be found in the cerebrospinal fluid. a patient was evaluated with MRI and lumbar puncture because he presented with mild encephalopathy, hallucinations, and seizures together with ataxia. there is no accepted consensus for the treatment of cerebellitis. 8-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with vertigo, headache, vomiting, and ataxia. dexamethasone treatment could be a good therapeutic option for mild cases. acute cerebellitis has good prognosis in childhood. Acute cerebellitis is an inflammatory process of the cerebellum. this neurological disorder has uncertain etiology and heterogeneous pathogenesis. however, AC is mostly considered in association with viral and bacterial infections."}
