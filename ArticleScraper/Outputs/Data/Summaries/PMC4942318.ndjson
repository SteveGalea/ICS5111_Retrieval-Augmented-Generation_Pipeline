{"summary": "plasma is a complex mixture of water, inorganic salts, nutrients (such as carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids), organic waste products, peptides, enzymes, hormones, and more than 1,000 proteins1,2. there are four major categories of plasma proteins3: (i) albumins; (ii) globulins; (iii) fibrinogen; and (iv) coagulation factors. FP and thawed plasma have a shelf-life of 24 hours once thawed5,8. in FP, the levels of FVIII, alone, are lower (65\u201380% respect to FFP), although adequate for haemostasis8. thawed plasma is made from a frozen product (FFP or FP) plasma may be used to prepare cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement and the treatment of von Willebrand\u2019s disease. typical therapeutic use of plasma for correction of coagulopathy involves transfusion of approximately 10 to 20 mL/kg per transfusion, resulting in exposure to multiple donors. the history of Transfusion Medicine is essentially that of a continuous and relentless pursuit of procedures to make blood transfusion safe and effective. safety is based on the prevention of the two main risks associated with allogeneic transfusion. the traditional serological tests for the detection of donor carriers of antigens of infectious agents have been progressively improved over years and especially in the last decade16. NAT have contributed to the reduction of the risk of TTI since NAT technologies have the potential to detect viraemia earlier than serological methods. despite progress made in screening for blood-transmitted diseases, both the post-infection diagnostic window and the appearance of novel infective agents remain critical issues for the safety of blood transfusions26. many pathogens that have the potential to invade the blood supply are not yet screened for because of the low prevalence of the disease in the general population. pathogens such as west Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus, or variant Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) prion have emerged as transfusion-transmissible infectious agents. pathogen reduction technologies are able to reduce the risk of known and unknown pathogens. photoactive substance for inactivation of pathogens and leucocytes in human platelet concentrates has been introduced. theraflex\u00ae UV-Platelets system was developed by the research foundation of the german red cross blood services. the method is not discussed in this HTA42. the guidelines and instructions for the use of pathogen-inactivated plasma are currently the same as those for FFP. a more evidence-based approach to the assessment of the safety and efficacy of these new pathogen-reduced plasma products is required. the application of PRT to individual plasma units has been preferred since 2002. the use of a plasma was introduced in the Blood Transfusion Centre of Mont Godinne in October 2003. the use of a plasma was then used for plasma apheresis in 2007, followed by buffy coat platelets in 200945. Germany MB treatment to inactivate viruses in plasma was originally developed by the German Red Cross Blood Centre, Springe, Germany. the MB system allows treatment of individual units of plasma. the current system (theraflex MB\u00ae plasma system, MacoPharma, Tourcoing, France) has a number of improved features. only in some Italian regions have specific indications for the use of SD plasma been given. since 2002, MB treatment of plasma can be performed \u201cin-house\u201d in single Blood Transfusion Units that acquire all the necessary equipment, reagents and materials. since 2004, the United Kingdom Blood Services have been importing FFP from the USA for all neonates and children born after 1 January 1996. Switzerland Switzerland is moving towards nationwide application of PRT to plasma and platelets. SD treatment of plasma for clinical use has been licensed and is currently being used60. MB plasma, R plasma and A plasma are currently not used in either country. there is no SD plasma currently available in Canada. a particular type of SD plasma, named PLAS+SD\u00ae, was once available. PLAS+SD\u00ae (Vitex, Watertown, MA, USA) was licensed in the USA in 1998. but subsequently withdrawn from the market. significant product differences can be ascribed to the production methods. the first evidence of human-to-human transmission of vCJD via a blood transfusion was obtained in the united kingdom. early in 2004, the UK Department of Health excluded all subjects known to have had blood transfusions since 198071. individuals who lived in the united kingdom for a total period of 6 or more months between 1980 and 1996 are ineligible to donate blood. reducing the dose rate has been reported to improve the balance between protein recovery and virus inactivation. the principal challenge in using gamma irradiation is the inactivation of the desired quantity of virus while maintaining the structural and functional integrity of proteins76. there is still a residual risk of infections by pathogens for which no detection system exists. in the united states, epidemiological data are evaluated, but out of the scope of marketing authorisation for plasma-derived medicinal products. current pathogen-reduction methods cannot, however, inactivate or destroy most spores and non-conventional agents such as prions. studies on inactivation of HIV, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (PVB19) by pasteurisation have demonstrated viral reduction of at least 6.4, 4.2, and at least 3.9 log. lyophilised concentrate at 100 \u00b0C for 30 minutes inactivated HAV and HIV to below detectable levels within 10 minutes. lyophilisation and vapour heat at 60 \u00b0C inactivated approximately 6 log of HAV in spiked FVIII concentrates within 8 to 10 hours. however, vapour heat at 60 \u00b0C may be insufficient to inactivate HBV completely. iodine Iodine is a strong oxidising agent and therefore a powerful microbicidal agent. but it is not sufficiently selective in its free form. in these bound forms, the virucidal action of iodine is more controlled. in-process viral inactivation treatments SD treatment remains the most frequent viral inactivation procedure for plasma products. lipid-enveloped viruses are inactivated in a few minutes and the functional activity of even the most labile plasma proteins is well preserved. viruses that adhere to resins cannot be completely washed out. equipment and materials must be sanitised with validated chemical and/or physical treatments to inactivate and remove viruses. heat treatment of lyophilised products (dry heat) is used in modern plasma fractionation. filtration may not be feasible for products containing proteins of a size comparable to or larger than the viruses or pores of the filter. however, a VWF concentrate filtered through 35 nm pore membranes had a reduction of enveloped viruses (HIV, BVDV and PRV) of at least 5.0 log, although filtration removed large VWF multimers as well. the use of PRT for labile blood components is increasing slowly but steadily. concerns about reduced component quality and toxicity have limited or prevented the routine use of PRT in many countries. increasing use and development of these novel technologies suggests that pathogen reduction has entered a stage of maturity. psoralens such as psoralens such as amotosalen and amotosalen. the latter compounds interfere with nucleic acids by alkylation chemistry. they become activated by mechanisms other than an external light source. MB plasma was first produced routinely for clinical use in 1992. intercept\u00ae plasma has been available on the european market for more than a decade. the option of using Mirasol\u00ae to treat previously FP has been validated more recently. but few data have been published on its clinical efficacy and safety2. in the early 1990s, SD plasma was considered a blood product in Germany and France. in most of the other European countries, it is treated as a medicinal product95. in most of the other European countries, it is treated as a medicinal product. the introduction of PLAS+SD\u00ae with the American Red Cross logo and the fact that the American Red Cross was the exclusive US distributor provoked strong reactions from members of America\u2019s Blood Centres. the American Red Cross set the price for PLAS+SD\u00ae 30% higher than expected and remarkable differences between PLAS+SD\u00ae and the European SD plasma were demonstrated. the current legislation in the united kingdom does not require independent formal pathogen reduction validation. the current legislation in the united kingdom does not require independent formal pathogen reduction validation other than occasional studies on individual pathogens. in the united states, the FDA approved the Intercept\u00ae Blood System. the system is currently approved and used in Europe for platelets and plasma100. the system is currently used in more than 50 blood centres in 15 countries. the option of treating FP with Mirasol\u00ae has also been validated. the SD process is the most widely used, best validated and robust pathogen inactivation technology known today. many million doses of SD-treated plasma proteins have been transfused without any report of transmission of enveloped viruses91,104. the process is preceded by filtration with a 1 m filter to remove cells and debris. in 1991\u20131992 manufacturing of SD plasma began, initially at Melville Biologics. manufacturing was transferred to a spin-off, V.I. Technologies, Inc. VITEX (Watertown, MA, USA), which subsequently produced the American SD plasma, PLAS+SD\u00ae. Octapharma has launched an SD plasma whose manufacture involves an additional chromatographic step combining a specific prion-binding ligand gel with SD treatment. the treatment is then performed at 31 \u00b0C for 4 hours, followed by two or three oil extraction steps optionally followed by hydrophobic chromatography. the treatment is then performed at 31 \u00b0C for 4 hours, followed by two or three oil extraction steps optionally followed by hydrophobic chromatography. in vitro studies have demonstrated that the SD method applied to plasma eliminates all lipid-enveloped viruses, including WNV, with high safety margins. the existing literature demonstrates the inactivation of several marker viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, Sendai virus) SD plasma production process eliminates bacteria, protozoa, cells and cellular fragments. however, it has no effect on non-lipid-enveloped viruses. SD treatment prevents transmission of HAV and PVB19. light excites the phenothiazine dye and produces highly reactive singlet oxygen. the latter oxidizes guanosine and thereby breaks nucleic strands. the MB system does not remove the viral nucleic acid that has been inactivated. assays that are based on NAT could remain positive. the springe process requires a 1 M concentration of the photosensitiser and a red light (600\u2013700 nm) fluency rate of approximately 10 mWcm2. the original protocol was in use for more than a decade. over one million MB plasma units were transfused before the Paul Ehrlich institute withdrew the license126. the Theraflex\u00ae MB system incorporates an 85-g (0.227 M) pellet of MB hydrochloride per plasma unit. a plasma volume between 235 and 315 mL is acceptable, resulting in a final concentration of 0.72 to 0.97 M/L MB plasma. the filtration further decreases the MB content in the plasma to a final concentration of about 19 nM/L, which is less than 2% of the initial MB concentration. MB is not considered useful for inactivating intracellular viruses or for reducing bacteria and protozoa. the MB plasma system has produced a reduction of 5 logs of PVB19 virus131. MB without illumination was also able to lower PVB19 levels by 1\u20132 log. additional illumination enhances this by 3\u20134 log132. amotosalen is a tricyclic molecule consisting of a furan and a pyrone moiety. it quickly cross cell membranes, bacterial walls or viral envelopes and readily interact with nucleic acids without interacting with proteins or cellular lipids. the reaction with nucleic acids does not depend on the generation of active oxygen species, which damage the cell. intercept\u00ae technology for pathogen inactivation of platelets or plasma components is based on two major steps: the alkylating agent (150 mol/L, final concentration) penetrates cellular and nuclear membranes and binds to double-stranded DNA and RNA. when activated by low-energy UVA light (320\u2013400 nm), amotosalen cross-links nucleic acids, thus blocking DNA/RNA replication86. HTLV and CMV can be inactivated to a very marked extent61,140. the wide spectrum of enveloped viruses for which very efficient inactivation has been demonstrated also includes duck HBV, BVDV, PRV, vaccinia virus and the influenza strains H1N1 and H5N1141. the number of infections with emerging protozoa has been increasing. the protozoa of greatest concern are Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), Leishmania spp. and Babesia microti143. this association of riboflavin/UV light has been used for a very long time as standard phototherapy of neonatal jaundice, without any reported problem66. riboflavin/UV light treatment has proven to be effective against a range of pathogens. psoralen/UVA and riboflavin inactivated with psoralen/UVA. inactivation of infectious agents in plasma and platelets using psoralen/UVA. different methods of pathogen inactivation in plasma are compared in Table V. the different methods of pathogen inactivation in plasma are compared in Table V. pheresis plasma must be split if >360 mL. shelf life 4 years at below 18 \u00b0C 2 years at 30 \u00b0C 2 years at below 25 \u00b0C Illumination time Not applicable 15 min new Mecotronic B2; 20 min with older equipment 3\u20136 min for 2 bags 5\u20138 min for 1 bag Primary target Lipid membranes Nucleic acids Nucleic acids Compound toxicity Low Low High None Removal of active compounds Yes, oil extraction and hydrophobic psoralen-UVA and riboflavin-UV light are examples of treatments applicable to single-donor plasma or mini-pools of plasma. the current technology requires a plasma fractionation facility. the current technology requires a plasma fractionation facility. the processing bag is then immerged into a water bath to warm the TNBP-plasma mixture at 37 \u00b0C and then treated for 4 hours under constant gentle stirring. the TNBP-plasma mixture is then transferred aseptically in a biological cabinet into a 300-mL bag filled with 15 mL of sterile castor oil. the bag is then suspended to ensure gentle stirring for at least 15 minutes. the introduction of novel technologies into manufacturing processes may have an impact on the quality of plasma-derived products. a new chromatographic step for the selective binding of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) to an affinity ligand was developed and optimised for PrPSc capture and attached to synthetic resin particles. the differences between Uniplas\u00ae/OctaplasLG\u00ae and Octaplas\u00ae lie in the time of exposure to SD (i.e. universal plasma vs blood group-specific plasma) in Italy, SD virus-inactivated plasma is derived from pooled FFP (from up to 2,500 blood donors) by treatment with TNBP solvent and Triton X-100 detergent (PlasmaSafe\u00ae) theraflex\u00ae MB-Plasma System includes an active compound, which is integrated into the bag system as a pill containing 85 g of MB. it is a pathogen-inactivation system capable of treating both single units and pools of many plasma units. ated products are filtered twice (Plasmaflex PLAS4\u00ae; MacoPharma), resulting in virtually cell-free plasma155. blueflex\u00ae reduces the concentration of MB and its derivatives in the treated plasma by more than 1 log. the combined use of MB and Blueflex\u00ae ensure minimal exposure to MB or its derivatives154. methylene blue (MB) relies on oxidative chemistry to achieve pathogen reduction. if air is present in the viral reduction studies, it can lead to greater levels of reduction. however, if absent in the plasma protein quality studies, results on maintenance of protein quality would be better. the system is adaptable, giving many options for implementing it into unique settings; - intuitive, icon-based user interface; - possibility of using one or several illuminators to support production requirements. the process: - can be used on single-unit plasma volumes; - can be applied to both apheresis and whole blood-derived plasma products; - can treat previously FP, removing time constraints associated with plasma processing. plasma exchange with fluid replacement is most effective treatment for acute idiopathic TTP12\u201314. Cryoprecipitate is an allogeneic blood product prepared from human plasma. it contains FVIII, VWF, fibrinogen, fibronectin and FXIII. in the 1960s, cryoprecipitate is used to replace fibrinogen in patients with acquired fibrinogen deficiency11. inappropriate indications Plasma should not be used13,15: (i) to expand the circulatory volume; (ii) to correct hypoproteinaemia; (iii) to correct an immune deficiency; (iv) for nutritional purposes; (v) to correct congenital or acquired deficiencies of clotting factors. transfusion-related transmission of pathogens has decreased significantly in the past years18,19. the risk of the most frequent transfusion-transmitted infections is currently low. processes to inactivate contaminating viruses, bacteria and protozoa may improve the safety of transfusion even further. NAT have contributed to the reduction of the risk of TTI. viraemia precedes seroconversion by several days in the case of HIV and several weeks in the case of HCV. tests that detect viral nucleic acids are considered a significant technological advance. the procedure, referred to as \u201cquarantine\u201d (Q), can reveal viral agents that escaped previous screening performed during the window period. it is applied to the plasma obtained by decomposition of whole blood, but is also suitable for productive plasmapheresis. the most appropriate name for the plasma that, regardless of the collection procedure is \u201cdonor-retested plasma\u201d or \u201cQ plasma\u201d27. pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) are able to reduce the risk of known and unknown pathogens. the major pathogen reduction methods currently available for plasma involve the use of a solvent/detergent (SD) treatment, methylene blue (MB), and an amotosalen (A) or riboflavin (R) based photochemical process35\u201341. the effectiveness of a technique is based on the destruction of a targeted functional element of the pathogen. most PRT use agents that target membranes or envelopes of the pathogens or their nucleic acids. agents with a mechanism of action targeting nucleic acids are stopped by blocking transcription and translation without affecting the cell membranes of therapeutic products. 16 member states of the Council of Europe employed PRT for plasma. nine of these countries used a mixture of quarantine and PRT. most frequent PRT were solvent/detergent treatment and exposure to MB44. a haemovigilance survey of 2005\u20132009 raised concerns because of the high rates of allergic reactions following transfusion of MB plasma. the french regulatory authority decided to discontinue the use of MB plasma and prohibited its transfusion from March 201247\u201350. but statistical analysis of the updated 2010 data did not confirm a significantly higher incidence of severe allergic reactions with MB plasma50. over 99% of FFP transfused in Ireland has been subjected to SD pathogen reduction. all the plasma for this product used in Ireland comes from the South Texas Blood and Tissue Centre in San Antonio (TX, USA)54. the health authorities of each of the 17 Autonomous Regions can choose between Q plasma and MB plasma as the preferred method for reducing the risk of virus transmission by plasma transfusion. for this reason, clinical teams have a very limited influence on the type of plasma they use. country Pathogen-inactivated plasma A-plasma R-plasma MB-plasma SD-plasma Australia x Austria x x Azerbaijan x Bahrain x Belarus x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x a particular type of SD plasma, named PLAS+SD\u00ae, was once available, but it is no longer available in Canada. the European SD plasma named Octaplas\u00ae (Octapharma, Vienna, Austria) was introduced into Canada in 1992. the FDA approved the use of the SD plasma named Octaplas\u00ae in the USA in January 2013. the application of PRT to individual plasma units has been preferred since 2002 and became mandatory in 2003. Finland Finland started to use SD plasma in 2007 and since 2013 all units administered are pathogen-reduced by SD treatment. three types of plasma are authorised by the Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00e9. MB plasma was first produced routinely for clinical use in 199251. the MB system allows treatment of individual units of plasma. the current system (theraflex MB\u00ae plasma system, MacoPharma, Tourcoing, France) has improved features. only in some Italian regions have specific indications for the use of SD plasma been given. since 2002, MB treatment of plasma can be performed \"in-house\" in single Blood Transfusion Units that acquire all the necessary equipment, reagents and materials55,56. Switzerland Switzerland is moving towards nationwide application of PRT to plasma and platelets. MB-treated plasma has been registered since 200751. amotosalen treatment for platelets and plasma44 has been approved. a recent analysis of haemovigilance data reveals a trend towards a higher incidence of severe allergic reactions with MB plasma50. amotosalen treatment was introduced in 2006 for apheresis and buffy coat platelets. MB plasma was first produced routinely for clinical use in 199251. the blood transfusion Committee has strongly recommended the implementation of PRT for plasma and platelet concentrates44. over 99% of FFP transfused in Ireland has been subjected to SD pathogen reduction. all the plasma for this product used in Ireland comes from the South Texas Blood and Tissue Centre in San Antonio. uk Imported plasma for internal use is currently pathogen-reduced with MB technology. the decision is a precautionary approach to the risk of transfusion-transmitted vCJD44. plasma Australia x Austria x x Azerbaijan x Bahrain x Belarus x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x the European SD plasma named Octaplas\u00ae was introduced into Canada in 1992. it can be considered as an alternative to standard plasma for certain indications63. the FDA approved the use of the SD plasma named Octaplas\u00ae in the USA for plasma exchange in patients with TTP. the European SD plasma named PLAS+SD\u00ae was once available, but it is no longer made. the thromboembolic adverse reactions that had not been observed with European SD plasma resulted in the interruption of SD plasma production in the USA in 2002\u2013200366. the FDA recently approved the use of the SD plasma named Octaplas\u00ae in the USA. measures against potential TTI by prions (infectious proteins) have been introduced. in 2003, the first evidence of human-to-human transmission of vCJD via a blood transfusion was obtained in the united kingdom. early in 2004, the UK department of health excluded all subjects known to have had blood transfusions since 198071. studies have been conducted to determine the virological and bacteriological safety of irradiated blood products and protein blood preparations. the first is the rupture of covalent bonds in target molecules, including both proteins and nucleic acids. the second is an indirect mechanism that uses water to produce reactive free radicals and other active radiolytic products. biosensors, nanoparticle-based DNA and protein biobarcode amplification assays are emerging diagnostic tools that may be used for screening donated blood78,79. only plasma that is serologically and NAT negative for HIV-1, HBV and HCV is provided to industry for treatment. inactivate or destroy most spores and non-conventional agents such as prions39. it must be ensured that the pathogen inactivation techniques do not cause toxicity in transfused patients43. dry heat treatment of lyophilised products has been demonstrated to give favourable results regarding inactivation of relevant or model viruses of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV38,83. dry heating of a lyophilised FVIII concentrate at 80 \u00b0C for 72 hours inactivated a wide range of viruses; dry heating of a lyophilised FVIII concentrate at 100 \u00b0C for 30 minutes inactivated a wide range of viruses. vapour heating of lyophilised products targets enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. lyophilisation and vapour heat at 60 \u00b0C inactivated 6 log of HAV in spiked FIX concentrates within 8 to 10 hours. none developed markers for infection with HCV or HIV during 6-15 months of follow-up. iodine-cross-linked dextran gel followed by a bed of cross-linked dextran gel used to trap and remove free iodine76. virus can be physically removed from plasma-derived products by fractionation (precipitation or chromatography) the extent of viral inactivation is influenced by the temperature, duration, and pressure during the treatment. the risk of neo-antigen formation, which can enhance protein immunogenicity, should be considered when using heat-based inactivation processes82. the fatty acids, caprylate, and tryptophanate protect albumin from heat denaturation are added at doses compatible with therapeutic use. nanofiltration is a specific viral filtration process applied to protein solutions. it involves multilayer membranes of 15 to 75 nm to remove viruses mostly by a sieving mechanism. Viral filtration alone resulted in virus reduction factors of at least 3.6 log10. a combination of SD, chromatography and viral filtration yielded reduction factors of at least 5.1 log for all tested viruses. dry heat treatment of lyophilised products has been demonstrated to give favourable results regarding inactivation of relevant or model viruses of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV38,83. dry heating of a lyophilised FVIII concentrate at 80 \u00b0C for 72 hours inactivated a wide range of viruses; dry heating of a lyophilised FVIII concentrate at 100 \u00b0C for 30 minutes inactivated HAV and HIV to below detectable levels within 10 minutes. lyophilisation and vapour heat at 60 \u00b0C inactivated 6 log of HAV in spiked FVIII concentrates within 8 to 10 hours. none developed markers for infection with HCV or HIV during 6 to 15 months of follow-up. vapour heat at 60 \u00b0C may be insufficient to inactivate HBV completely. iodine at a concentration of 1.05 mg/mL resulted in more than 7 log10 inactivation of model lipid-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. more than 70% of the activity of the clotting factors in plasma was retained. virus can be physically removed from plasma-derived products by fractionation (precipitation or chromatography) and filtration. heat treatment of protein solutions can inactivate both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. stabilisers can be removed by ultrafiltration, protein precipitation or chromatography. extent of viral inactivation is influenced by temperature, duration, and pressure. the treatment is applied to some coagulation factor concentrates. performed at 80 \u00b0C for 72 hours or at 100 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. fatty acids, caprylate, and tryptophanate protect albumin from heat denaturation. nm pore membranes had a reduction of enveloped viruses (HIV, BVDV, and PRV) of at least 5.0 log, although filtration removed large VWF multimers as well. viral filtration alone resulted in virus reduction factors of at least 3.6 log10. PRT are widely available with multiple CE-marked products to treat both plasma for transfusion (Intercept\u00ae, Mirasol\u00ae, Octaplas LG\u00ae, Octaplas LG\u00ae, Plasmasafe\u00ae, Theraflex\u00ae, Uniplas\u00ae, theraflex\u00ae, theraflex\u00ae, theraflex\u00ae, theraflex\u00ae, theraflex\u00ae, Uniplas\u00ae) raflex\u00ae MB plasma system has been successfully and routinely used by blood centres in several countries. the plasma is exposed to white-light to inactivate viruses and then filtered to reduce the MB89. the SD process is the most widely used, best validated and robust pathogen inactivation technology currently known. some countries (e.g. Switzerland and Belgium) have adopted PRT nationwide. other countries (e.g. France, Germany and Spain) only perform pathogen reduction in some regional blood transfusion services86. the FDA approved the use of Octaplas\u00ae (ligand gel)64. it is a blood group-specific, pooled human plasma product developed by Octapharma. in several European countries and in Australia, OctaplasLG\u00ae has been marketed since 2009 and its previous versions since 1992. the emerging Theraflex\u00ae MB plasma system (MacoPharma, Tourcoing, France) has a number of improved features and has been used routinely by blood centres in several countries. the current legislation in the united kingdom does not require independent formal pathogen reduction validation. in Spain approximately 250,000 units of plasma are transfused annually and 65% are MB plasma. the springe method is currently used in Spain by Grifols. the Intercept\u00ae Blood System gained the CE mark for platelets in 2002 and for plasma in 2006. the option of treating FP with Mirasol\u00ae has also been validated and enables sites to treat products already in their inventory103. the SD method of treatment is standardised and usually occurs in a centralised manufacturing centre in which plasma is processed as a large pool. the SD treatment requires that plasma is thawed rapidly and treated for 4 hours at 30 \u00b0C with TNBP solvent and Triton X-100 (or Tween-80) detergent107, both at 1%. the TNBP is then removed by extraction with ricin oil and the Triton X-100 by hydrophobic chromatography. a universal SD plasma (Uniplas\u00ae) has been developed by Octapharma. it is obtained by optimal mixing of plasma of different blood groups in order to neutralise unwanted anti-A and anti-B antibodies (of both IgM and IgG classes) the treatment at 31 \u00b0C is effective at inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses in plasma and cryoprecipitate115. the data confirm that the treatment at 31 \u00b0C is effective at inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses in plasma and cryoprecipitate115. u\u00e9 SD\u00ae (France) Apheresis plasma 60 litres (100 apheresis units) 4 h at 30 \u00b0C (1% TNBP + 1% Triton X-100) Bioplasma FDP\u00ae (South Africa) Recovered plasma 200 litres 4 h at 30 \u00b0C (1% TNBP + 1% Triton X-100) the first procedure described for inactivating pathogens in plasma involved the use of MB. MB is a positively charged phenothiazine derivative. it consists of a thiazine ring and two dimethylamino groups. at room temperature, MB is soluble in cold water. infectivity assays using cell cultures or animal models are most suitable for assessing the pathogen inactivation capacity of the MB system124. the rationale for the use of phenothiazine for pathogen inactivation of blood components is based on the absence of nucleic acids in red cells or plasma. in 1991, lambrecht et al. described a method to inactivate virus in plasma using MB dye and visible light125. awing of plasma units to disrupt leucocytes and release intracellular viruses has eliminated the need for freezing and thawing of the plasma. there are also differences among the systems to add MB to plasma. a microprocessor-controlled device (Macotronic V; Macropharma) was developed for the illumination of the Theraflex\u00ae MB system. it was equipped with high-intensity, low-pressure sodium lamps emitting yellow light at a wavelength of 590 nm. RT involve a sterile connection to a bag system equipped with a leucocyte-reduction filter, addition of MB and filters to remove the residual MB and its by-products52. there is still concern about the potential genotoxicity of MB. MB treatment provides a log reduction of >3.4 and 4.9\u20135.8, respectively. the effect of the MB system on malaria, caused by an intracellular parasite, has not been characterised. leucocyte filtration and the freeze-thawing process remove and disrupt parasite-containing cells. these benefits are also applicable to CMV and HTLV 1 and 2. amotosalen-nucleic acid cross-linking occurs in the presence of UVA light, but not in its absence. intercept\u00ae technology for pathogen inactivation of platelets or plasma components is based on two major steps: the alkylating agent (150 mol/L, final concentration) penetrates cellular and nuclear membranes and binds to double-stranded DNA. amotosalen solution container is illuminated with a compound adsorption device. the plasma mixture is passed through a compound adsorption device. the adsorption step takes approximately 20 minutes138. it is still debated whether the residual amotosalen and its degradation products could have some long-term side effects. adenovirus 5 and bluetongue virus are very susceptible to the treatment. PVB19 shows an intermediate level of inactivation, but calicivirus is only poorly susceptible. the capacity of the Intercept\u00ae technology to inactivate emerging and re-emerging pathogens is of great interest. riboflavin, also called vitamin B2, is a dietary nutrient with a known pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile145. it interacts directly with nucleic acids, resulting in the formation of pyrimidine dimers that block the elongation of nucleic acid transcripts146. clinical studies using the Mirasol\u00ae PRT for plasma are underway66. data from some studies indicate that the system can effectively be used to inactivate dengue and Chikungunya viruses in contaminated plasma and platelets.

MB is a positively charged phenothiazine derivative. infectivity assays using cell cultures or animal models are most suitable for assessing the pathogen inactivation capacity of the MB system124. in 1991, Lambrecht et al. described a method to inactivate virus in plasma using MB dye and visible light125. two different methods for MB treatment of human plasma for viral reduction are currently in use. the original Springe MB plasma process, described by Lambrecht51, used freezing and thawing of plasma units to disrupt leucocytes and thereby release intracellular viruses. there are also differences among the systems to add MB to plasma. a microprocessor-controlled device was developed for the illumination of the Theraflex\u00ae MB system. it was equipped with high-intensity, low-pressure sodium lamps emitting yellow light at a wavelength of 590 nm. both sides of the plasma pack were exposed to the illumination. the filtration further decreases the MB content in the plasma. MB is not considered useful for inactivating intracellular viruses or for reducing bacteria and protozoa, even though it does penetrate cells. MB plasma system has produced a reduction of 5 logs of PVB19 virus131. MB treatment provides a log reduction of >3.4 and 4.9\u20135.8, respectively. the effect of the MB system on malaria, caused by an intracellular parasite, has not been characterised. leucocyte filtration and freeze-thawing process remove and disrupt parasite-containing cells, thus preventing multiplication of the parasite. amotosalen-nucleic acid cross-linking occurs in the presence of UVA light, but not in its absence. intercalates into double-helical structures of DNA or RNA where covalent bonds between its reactive groups and pyrimidine bases are formed upon UVA illumination. even intrastrand reactions are possible. all the plasma is allowed to flow through the amotosalen solution container. the plasma mixture is illuminated with a compound adsorption device. the adsorption step takes approximately 20 minutes138. it is still debated whether the residual amotosalen and its degradation products could have some long-term side effects. adenovirus 5 and bluetongue virus are very susceptible to the treatment. PVB19 shows an intermediate level of inactivation, but calicivirus is only poorly susceptible. the capacity of the Intercept\u00ae technology to inactivate emerging and re-emerging pathogens is now of great interest. riboflavin is a dietary nutrient with a known pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile145. this essential natural vitamin absorbs both visible and UV light86. riboflavin mediates selective damage to nucleic acids without binding to cells or proteins. this new PRT facilitates processing and shortens the time of storage of plasma in the liquid state. this method provides levels of viral reduction in excess of those required to successfully close the window period of transmission for HIV, HBV and HCV. this method eliminates the viraemic period for WNV and possibly the chronic phase of transmission of human PVB19. the different methods of pathogen inactivation in plasma are compared in Table V. the different methods of pathogen inactivation in plasma are compared in Table V. cleic acids and induces covalent cross-linking upon UVA exposure Riboflavin associates with nucleic acids and mediates an oxygen-independent electron transfer upon UV exposure Blood components Plasma Plasma Plasma and platelets Plasma and platelets Plasma and platelets Products Octaplas\u00ae, OctaplasLG\u00ae, Uniplas\u00ae (Octapharma); Plasmasafe\u00ae (Kedrion); Plasmavitro-att\u00e9nu\u00e9 solvent/detergent (French Blood Service toxicity Low Low None Removal of active compounds Yes, oil extraction and hydrophobic chromatography Yes, by compound absorbing device Not required Residual level of active compounds Undetectable or trace amounts far below the toxicity level. Mutagenic effects improbable, but not excluded Very low levels of free S-59 and photoproducts. SD plasma is produced by incubating pools of hundreds or thousands of plasma donations with 1% TNBP and 1% Triton X-100 at 30 \u00b0C for 4 hours. the pooled SD plasma is sterile-filtered and aseptically dispensed into its final containers41. a 50\u201350% mixture of TNBP and Triton X-45 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) is used to fill a syringe. the process is then performed as described for the 2% TNBP treatment. the final centrifugation step is not performed. the selective binding of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) to an affinity ligand was introduced into the manufacturing process of the SD-treated biopharmaceutical plasma Octaplas\u00ae113. Uniplas\u00ae is a novel, universally applicable, blood group-independent, prion-depleted, SD-treated and human pooled plasma. the SD technique is derived from pooled FFP (from up to 2,500 blood donors) by treatment with TNBP solvent and Triton X-100 detergent (PlasmaSafe\u00ae) it is applied to single plasma units without the need to pool plasma donations. commercial systems that can be set up in standard blood centre GMP conditions are available. theraflex\u00ae MB-Plasma system is a pathogen-inactivation system. it is capable of treating both single units and pools of many plasma units. it is available as fully integrated systems for use from donation through to blood product storage. methylene blue (MB) relies on oxidative chemistry to achieve pathogen reduction. if air is present in the viral reduction studies, it can lead to greater levels of reduction. however, the pathogen reduction under these conditions may also be less. intercept\u00ae blood system for plasma includes an active compound, the illumination device, a sterile connecting device and treatment steps. each Intercept\u00ae processing set can produce up to three 200 mL transfusion units with less than 10 minutes hands-on time per processing set. SD treatment of plasma was the first method developed for the inactivation of viruses in plasma for transfusion. the current technology requires a plasma fractionation facility and is applied to large plasma pools. the pooled SD plasma is sterile-filtered and aseptically dispensed into its final containers. the TNBP-plasma mixture is then transferred aseptically in a biological cabinet into a 300-mL bag filled with 15 mL of sterile castor oil. the bag is then suspended to ensure gentle stirring for at least 15 minutes. the extraction procedure is repeated twice. the introduction of novel technologies into manufacturing processes may have an impact on the quality of plasma-derived products. a new chromatographic step for the selective binding of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) to an affinity ligand was introduced into the manufacturing process of the SD-treated plasma Octaplas\u00ae113. the differences between Uniplas\u00ae/OctaplasLG\u00ae and Octaplas\u00ae lie in the time of exposure to SD (i.e. 1\u20131.5 hours vs 4 hours) and in the prion removal step (i.e. with vs without prion removal)155. in Italy, SD virus-inactivated plasma is derived from pooled FFP. theraflex\u00ae MB-Plasma System includes an active compound, which is integrated into the bag system as a pill containing 85 g of MB. it is a pathogen-inactivation system capable of treating both single units and pools of many plasma units. the blueflex\u00ae filter reduces the concentration of MB and its derivatives in the treated plasma by more than 1 log. the combined use of MB and Blueflex\u00ae ensures minimal exposure to MB or its derivatives154. methylene blue (MB) relies on oxidative chemistry to achieve pathogen reduction. if air is present in the viral reduction studies, it can lead to greater levels of reduction. if absent in the plasma protein quality studies, results on protein quality would be better. illuminators can be set up in the same work area or distributed throughout a facility for optimal workflow and equipment layout. illuminators can be networked for centralised data capture. clinical studies using prototype devices for whole blood pathogen reduction are ongoing. a domain-specific search for efficacy aspects was merged with a basic search on Medline to obtain efficacy data on technical approaches to pathogen inactivation in plasma for clinical use. no publication date restrictions were applied and no safety-specific search was applied to the whole search strategy. amotosalen treatment resulted in a variable decline of between 0% and 30% in the activity of the plasma proteins. treatment resulted in a variable decline of between 0% and 30% in the activity of the plasma proteins. clinical studies using Mirasol\u00ae (riboflavin) pathogen inactivation technology are still underway. riboflavin light treatment Poor evidence on the effectiveness of solvent-detergent technology when used on plasma. three patients with acute TTP received SD-FFP plus prednisolone. all patients reached platelet counts of >50109/L. all patients maintained a stable remission 1 year later. each patient developed one or more deep vein thrombosis while receiving 100% SD-FFP or 50% SD-FFP and 50% cryosupernatant plasma as replacement fluid. the use of SD-FFP alone or in 50% combination with cryosupernatant plasma may lead to difficulty in maintaining safe protein S activity levels. 20 patients with TTP underwent plasma exchange using either standard FFP (group A, n=13) or MB-FFP (group B, n=7) the use of MB-FFP to treat TTP seems to be associated with a higher number of plasma exchange sessions and greater transfusion requirements without improving clinical results. fibrinogen, FVIII, antithrombin, protein C, free protein, -antitrypsin and plasminogen did not differ significantly between the two study arms. however, protein S activity did not increase after SD-FFP infusion. Neither SD-FFP nor FFP had significant influence on prothrombin fragments. intraoperative plasma samples from patients treated with FFP or ESDEP\u00ae were analysed. plasma levels of D-dimer (6.58 vs 1.53 g/mL; p=0.02) and fibrinogen degradation products (60 vs 23 mg/L; p=0.018) were significantly higher in patients treated with ESDEP\u00ae. the same subjects received warfarin over 4 days to lower FVII levels then received 1 L of either pathogen inactivated or standard FFP. after 2 weeks, subjects underwent a regimen identical to that with the other type of FFP. the effect disappeared after 8 hours. post-transfusion prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and clinical haemostasis were evaluated before and after the A-FFP transfusions. the mean pre-transfusion prothrombin time (20.7 22.2 seconds) was corrected after A-FFP (13.82.4 seconds, p0.001) patients were treated with A-FFP for a maximum of 35 days until remission was achieved. no significant differences in time to remission, relapse rates, time to relapse, total volume and number of study plasma exchanges between the two groups. icacy of SD-FFP treatment in 17 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders was determined in a non-bleeding state. the mean plasma half-lives of FV, FVIII, FX, FX and fibrinogen were 18, 43 and 33 hours. all patients underwent replacement therapy for elective procedures at risk of bleeding. episodes treatment was started with cryosupernatant and changed to Octaplas\u00ae. it was used exclusively in 24% and Octaplas\u00ae exclusively in 42% of all episodes. no significant difference in median number of plasma exchanges to achieve remission. Q-FFP in 39 of 102 episodes of idiopathic TTP included daily plasma exchange and corticosteroids. patients who received more than two units of red blood cells, more than four units of Octaplas\u00ae and more than eight units of platelets had the highest stroke rate of 21%. transfused Octaplas\u00ae, platelets and history of extra-cardiac arteriopathy were significantly associated with post-operative stroke. the same author, in another study176, found that blood product transfusion is independently associated with all-cause mortality. SD-FFP was the only one associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. the 63 patients undergoing liver transplantation were divided into two groups. both groups achieved the thromboelastography goals but with a lower number of transfusions in the SD plasma group (p0.0001) fewer units of MB-FFP were transfused than either SD-FFP or MB-FFP. Table VIII summarises clinical studies comparing technologies for the inactivation/reduction of pathogens in fresh-frozen plasma. low/moderate de la Rubia J, 2001 Patients with TTP Total 20 13 patients received standard FFP (group A) 7 patients received MB-FFP (group B) Bilirubin values were higher in group A (p0.05 vs MB-FFP) Mean number of procedures was higher in group B (217 vs 113, p0.01) Mean duration of hospitalisation was also longer. /mL for ESDEP vs FFP (p=0.002); Fibrinogen degradation products, 161 vs 57 mg/L for ESDEP vs FFP (p=0.001); Alpha2-antiplasmin levels significantly lower in patients receiving ESDEP during the anhepatic phase (0.37 vs 0.65 IU/mL; p0.001) and after reperfusion (0.27 vs 0.58 IU/mL; p=0.00 MB-FFP seems to be less effective than FFP in the treatment of TTP. it is therefore prudent to avoid MB-FFP until therapeutic equivalency to FFP has been established by randomised controlled trials. mean pre-transfusion prothrombin time (51.229.3 sec) corrected after A-FFP (32.05.1 sec, p0.001) the kinetics and therapeutic efficacy of the replacement coagulation factors in A-FFP were consistent with those of conventional FFP. 81 procedures: 172 cryosupernatant (median 1.5 per admission, IQR 0.0\u20136.2) and 509 with Octaplas\u00ae (median 8.0 per admission, IQR 0.8\u201316.5). patients with TTP Total of 102 TTP episodes. use of blood products ranging from no transfusion to combined transfusion of red blood cells, platelets and Octaplas\u00ae was associated with a significant increase in post-operative stroke incidence. there was a significant difference (p0.001) in the increase in pre-transfusion vs post-transfusion INR per transfusion of two plasma units. the use of SD-plasma provided the same clinical results (thromboelastography goals) but with a significant reduction in the amount of plasma transfusions. no significant differences were found in the changes in fibrinogen, factor V, and prothrombin time among the three arms. plasma pools before and after SD treatment were assessed for parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. the stability of fibrinogen, FV, FVII, and FVIII after thawing was also examined. a marked decrease of FVIII activity was found without significant variations of fibrinogen, FV and FVII. the authors concluded that the efficacy and safety of SD-FFP were maintained because the reductions of the activities of clotting factors and inhibitors were not critical. prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, FVII and protein C levels were within the normal reference range for both SD plasma and FFP. the difference in coagulation factor levels may have been further exacerbated by the smaller volume of the SD plasma units compared with the units of standard FFP (250 mL) depasse et al. (2005)183 studied the influence of MB treatment on fibrinogen activity and fibrinogen polymerisation indices. they split ten apheresis plasma bags into two equal aliquots, both of which were leucofiltered and virally inactivated. one was processed using a blueflex\u00ae MB removal filter to remove residual MB and its by-products. all investigated coagulation factors and protease inhibitors were stable for at least 8 hours during storage of Octaplas\u00ae at +4 \u00b0C. the optical density values of stored Octaplas\u00ae were more stable during the storage period than those of FFP. study by Singh et al. (2006)185 evaluated the pathogen-inactivation efficacy of A-FFP and the effect of photochemical treatment with the Intercept\u00ae Blood System on plasma function. factor activity after photochemical treatment, expressed as a proportion of pre-treatment activity, was 72 to 73% of baseline fibrinogen and FVIII activity. thrombin generation was more impaired following the use of local MB inactivation systems in blood banks than following industrial MB treatment. no clear-cut correlation between coagulation factor levels in MB-FFP and impaired thrombin generation capacity was found, suggesting a composite effect. ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lower in cryosupernatant [median (range): 87% (70\u2013107%)] than in FFP (p0.05). levels of VWF antigen decreased after photo-oxidation by both methods. concentrations of fibrinogen, FII, FII, FVII, FVIII, FIX, and IL-10 differed significantly in SD-FFP and FFP. higher concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-, IL-8, and IL-10 were found in SD-FFP. 14 plasma units were analysed after 6 months and 1 year of storage at 18 \u00b0C. total protein, FII, FII, 88%, FIX, FX and FXII levels were modestly affected by storage for 1 year at 18 \u00b0C. 93 IU/unit, 262 mg/unit and 250 IU/unit were found in cryoprecipitate units prepared from R-FFP. clotting factor levels and bacterial contamination were investigated using 20 units of SD plasma. FVII and FVIII showed a critical drop of more than 20%. clotting factors in thawed SD plasma remained stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 4 \u00b0C. MB-treated plasma could turn plasma itself and the cryoprecipitates obtained from it into a useful therapeutic option for the treatment of von Willebrand disease. the efficacy and safety of SD plasma is not impaired by reduced activities of protein S and plasmin inhibitor. MB removal by either of the available filters has little impact on the coagulation factor content of plasma. freezing plasma before MB treatment resulted in a futrher small loss. ation factor activity was 72 to 73% of baseline fibrinogen and factor (F)VIII activity. 78 to 98% for FII, FV, FVII, FIX, FIX, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and 2-antiplasmin. all proteins were well preserved during storage at 18 \u00b0C for 1 year. all clotting factors in thawed SD-FFP remain stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 4 \u00b0C. fibrinogen, FII, FV, FVII, FVIII as well as FIX, FX, FXIII decreased significantly over time. protein C and VWF-antigen levels were slightly elevated after 6 days of storage. Osselaer et al. (2008)45 compared plasma units made from a pool of two ABO-matched fresh apheresis units treated with either A-FFP or MB-FFP. plasma coagulation function was assessed immediately after treatment, after 30 days of frozen storage and after an additional 24 hours at 4 \u00b0C after thawing. MB-FFP exhibited higher FIX retention than the A-FFP after 24 hours of storage at 4 \u00b0C after thawing. overall coagulation factor levels and stability were better preserved than those of MB-FFP. plasma exchange was carried out in patients with a diagnosis of acquired idiopathic TTP. ADAMTS-13 enzyme activity and inhibitor levels, VWF multimers and platelet count were analysed in correlation with patients\u2019 outcome. patients diagnosed with primary idiopathic TTP 89 (41 given SD-FFP vs 48 given cryosupernatant plasma) Survival at 6 months not significantly different between groups. protein S, ADAMTS-13, the inhibitor and VWF multimers levels were not significantly different between groups. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating coagulation variables. Variations of haemoglobin concentration were comparable between treatments and within the normal range. the 90% CI was within predefined limits of equivalence. plasmapheresis (600 mL) preceded the transfusion. the primary efficacy end-points were changes in coagulation factors and haemostatic variables compared to baseline. all 90% confidence intervals were within the equivalency interval (10% to 10%). significantly higher 2-antiplasmin levels were found at 15 minutes (p=0.001) and 2 hours (p=0.019) after transfusion of the LG product compared to its predecessor Recovery is indicative of the efficacy of the studied products to restore clotting factors and inhibitors. plasmaSafe\u00ae is a pharmaceutical-like product with a standardised content of coagulation factors. it is effective in correcting coagulation defects and in treating patients with TTP. aPTT ranged from 24\u201341 seconds. the first developed method to inactivate enveloped viruses in plasma protein preparations was SD treatment. the major advantages of SD plasma over FFP and other pathogen-inactivated plasmas are its extreme safety with respect to TRALI and the significantly lower likelihood of allergic reactions. the photosensitisers and their photoproducts are absolutely safe, robust in daily routine practice, cost-effective and have controllable efficacy. clinical experience with PRT-treated plasma has substantiated the product\u2019s safety. work in this field is in an early stage and the full potential of these technologies has yet to be determined. publication date restrictions were applied and no safety-specific search was applied to the whole search strategy in the Cochrane and Call Detail Recording databases. some inclusion/exclusion criteria were defined: - language: papers in languages other than English were excluded; - relevance: studies focusing on safety and/or lacking clinical data were excluded; - study design: literature reviews were excluded. five articles were excluded because they were written in a language other than English, 40 were not relevant, 24 were not clinical studies, five did not consider the efficacy domain and one was not available as a full text. the level of evidence of the selected studies was appraised by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale. adulescu L, et al. Pharmacokinetic study of FFP photochemically treated with amotosalen (S-59) and UV light compared to FFP in healthy volunteers anticoagulated with warfarin. able to improve haemostasis in all of the included studies. compared with FFP to reduce the risk of transmitting lipid-enveloped viruses. each patient developed one or more deep vein thrombosis while receiving 100% SD-FFP or 50% SD-FFP and 50% cryosupernatant plasma as replacement fluid. the use of SD-FFP alone or in 50% combination with cryosupernatant plasma may lead to difficulty maintaining safe protein S activity levels. the use of MB-FFP was associated with a 56% increase in the aggregated demand for plasma. transfusion of non-virus-inactivated cryoprecipitate doubled the first year. 20 patients with TTP underwent plasma exchange using either standard FFP or MB-FFP (group B, n=7) free protein S levels, protein S activity, prothrombin fragments F1+2, plasminogen, protease inhibitor and 1-antitrypsin were measured. the decrease in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time did not differ significantly between the two study arms. Uniplas\u00ae has a similar effect as Octaplas\u00ae in the treatment of bleeding in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. a retrospective observational study was performed to clarify an increased incidence of hyperfibrinolysis. intraoperative plasma samples from patients treated with ESDEP\u00ae were analysed. 92 healthy volunteers donated plasma by apheresis. half of the collected plasma was treated with the psoralen amotosalen hydrochloride (A-FFP) the same subjects received warfarin over 4 days to lower FVII levels then received 1 L of either pathogen inactivated or standard FFP. an open-label, multicentre trial was conducted by de Alarcon et al. (2005)170 to measure the kinetics of specific coagulation factors, haemostatic efficacy, and safety of photochemical treatment with amotosalen hydrochloride (S-59) FFP (A-FFP) in patients with congenital coagulation factor deficiencies. thrombosis: obesity and bed rest. he started anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin. the deficient factors were replaced with MB-FFP. deficient clotting factors and haemostatic efficacy of SD-FFP treatment in 17 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders. the authors suggest that therapeutic plasma exchange with SD-FFP should be preferred in patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders. in 12 episodes only cryosupernatant was used. in 15 episodes treatment was started with cryosupernatant and changed to Octaplas\u00ae. there was no significant difference in the median number of plasma exchanges to achieve remission. MB-FFP was used in 63 and Q-FFP in 39 of 102 episodes of idiopathic TTP. the treatment programme comprised daily plasma exchange and corticosteroids. the main end-point was remission status on day 8. patients who received more than two units of red blood cells, more than four units of Octaplas\u00ae and more than eight units of platelets had the highest stroke rate of 21%. increased amount of transfused Octaplas\u00ae, platelets and history of extra-cardiac arteriopathy were significantly associated with post-operative stroke. the relationship between pre-transfusion and post-transfusion was linear (r=0.97; p0.001) plasma treated with riboflavin and UV light is haemostatically competent, but larger volumes are required compared to those necessary when using non-inactivated FFP. the 63 patients undergoing liver transplantation were divided into two groups depending on whether they were transfused with FFP. the median number of transfused plasma units was 10, 10, and 8 units. the difference between groups decreased and the excess plasma volume transfused with MB-FFP was reduced from 24 to 14%. results suggest that the use of MB-FFP was associated with a moderate increase in volume transfused compared to Q-FFP. low Lerner RG, 2000 Patients with acquired coagulation deficits Total 45 22 treated with SD-FFP vs 23 treated with FFP Ability to reduce a prolonged prothrombin time to 15 s. no clinical or statistically significant differences were observed after infusion with SD-FFP or FFP. 3 mg/mL for ESDEP vs FFP (p=0.02); Fibrinogen degradation products, 161 vs 57 mg/L for ESDEP vs FFP (p=0.001); Alpha2-antiplasmin levels: significantly lower in patients receiving ESDEP during the anhepatic phase (0.37 vs 0.65 IU/mL; p0.001) patients with TTP Total 56 MB-FFP was used for fluid replacement in 27 episodes and FFP in 29 Recurrence under treatment: 14 (52%) vs 5 (17%) Adjusted OR (95% CI): 4.6 (1.2\u201317) Lack of remission by the 9th day of treatment: 18 (62%) vs 11 (38%) Adjusted OR (95% CI): 5.2 (1.3\u201320) Death from unresponsive disease: 4 (15%) vs 1 (3 patients with congenital coagulation factor deficiencies 34 Factor (F) II, FV, FVII, and FX replacement: p0.001 Mean pre-transfusion prothrombin time (20.722.2 sec) corrected after A-FFP (13.82.4 sec, p0.001) Mean pre-transfusion partial thromboplastin time (51.229.3 sec) corrected after A-FFP (32.05.1 sec, p0.001) MB-FFP is safer than the untreated product even in patients who require large quantities of plasma transfusion. the use of cryosupernatant and SD-FFP was equally efficacious in this cohort of patients. patients after coronary artery bypass surgery 2,226 Risk of stroke was significantly increased with SD-FFP. use of blood products ranging from no transfusion (stroke rate 1.6%) to combined transfusion of red blood cells, platelets and Octaplas\u00ae was associated with a significant increase in post-operative stroke incidence. factors V (p=0.001 vs FFP) and XII (p=0.02 vs FFP) blood levels were lower in the SD-plasma patients who also showed lower INR (p=0.007 vs FFP), activated partial thromboplastin time (p=0.002 vs FFP) and antithrombin III levels (p=0.01 vs FFP) differences in conditioning volume per plasma unit as well as bleeding risk factors preclude definitive conclusions on a differential efficacy between MB-FFP, SD-FFP, and Q-FFP in the setting of liver transplantation. in 1998, 12 plasma pools, 12 batches of SD-treated plasma, and 12 units of Q-FFP were extensively analysed. a marked decrease of FVIII activity was found without significant variations of fibrinogen, FV and FVII. no significant reductions of the activities of clotting factors and important plasma proteins due to the SD treatment were observed. authors suggest clinical studies are needed to confirm loss of clotting factors in SD-FFP. they measured procoagulant factors (fibrinogen, FV and FVIII), anticoagulant factors (protein C and protein S), prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. mL), FIX (0.12 IU/mL), FXI (0.16 IU/mL), FXII (0.15 U/mL), VWF antigen (0.06 U/mL), and fibrinogen (0.79 g/L) apheresis plasma bags were leucofiltered and virally inactivated in a standardised way. the aim of Heger et al. (2005)184 was to study the quality of SD-FFP, Octaplas\u00ae, and single-donor FFP units during 48 hours of storage after thawing. all investigated coagulation factors and protease inhibitors were stable for at least 8 hours during storage of Octaplas\u00ae at +4 \u00b0C. study by Singh et al. (2006)185 evaluated the pathogen-inactivation efficacy of A-FFP and the effect of photochemical treatment with the Intercept\u00ae Blood System on plasma function. factor H concentrations were normal in all the plasma samples studied, without significant differences. ema pallidum, greater than 5.9; Borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; Plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; Trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and Babesia microti, greater than 5.3. no clear-cut correlation between coagulation factor levels in MB-FFP and impaired thrombin generation capacity was found. ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lower in cryosupernatant [median (range): 87% (70\u2013107%)] than in FFP (p0.05). levels of VWF antigen decreased after photo-oxidation by both methods. theusinger et al. (2011)188 compared the concentrations of coagulation factors and cytokines in SD-FFP and FFP. FII, FII, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FXIII, VWF, D-dimers, ADAMTS-13 protease. Ettinger et al. (2012)189 evaluated the in-vitro protein quality of apheresis-derived plasma products processed between 8 and 8.5 hours after collection. plasma (2055 mL) was combined with 355 mL of 500 M riboflavin, and exposed to UV light (6.24 J/mL) clotting factor levels and bacterial contamination were investigated using 20 units of SD plasma. clotting factor levels and bacterial contamination were investigated. clotting factor levels and bacterial contamination were investigated. VIII 70% (16%, p0.0001), FIX 96% (8, p0.0001), FXI 119% (4%, p=0.3666), FXIII 89% (1%, p=0.0019), free protein S 76% (4%, p=0.0019), protein C 96% (+1%, p=0.0371), antithrombin 92% (3%, p0.0001) and VWF antigen 137% (+2%, p=0.2205). the authors concluded that VWF integrity was better preserved when using A-FFP than when using either the original SD method or the MB method. Table IX summarises the above-described in vitro studies, comparing technologies for the inactivation/reduction of pathogens in FFP. before vs after Bluflex removal (p0.01) for: PT (ratio), fibrinogen, factor (F) V, FVII, FX, FXIIa, C3a; (p0.05) for aPTT (ratio), FII. freezing plasma before MB treatment resulted in futrher small loss. low Singh Y, 2006 Apheresis- derived plasma units Not specified Retention of coagulation factor activity was 72 to 73% of baseline fibrinogen and factor (F)VIII activity. the study confirmed maintenance of adequate plasma coagulation and antithrombotic protein function after inactivation. clotting factor levels in thawed SD-FFP remained stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 4 \u00b0C. all proteins were well preserved during storage at 18 \u00b0C for 1 year. low/moderate Octaplas\u00ae plasma bags 20 From 6 to 24 hours after thawing. Slight decreases were shown for factor (F) II, FV, FVII, FVIII, FX, FX, FXIII, free protein S and plasmin inhibitor (p0.0001). Clotting factors remain stable in thawed SD-FFP stored for up to 6 days. low/moderate SD-FFP: solvent/detergent-treated fresh-frozen plasma; MB-FFP: methylene blue-treated fresh-frozen plasma; aPT: prothrombin time; aPT: activated partial thromboplastin time; amotosalen-treated fresh-frozen plasma; amotosalen-treated fresh-frozen plasma; amotosalen-treated fresh-frozen plasma. MB-FFP contained higher mean levels of plasminogen, antithrombin, and plasmin inhibitor than A-FFP. overall coagulation factor levels and stability were preserved better in A-FFP than in MB-FFP. plasma exchange was carried out in patients with a diagnosis of acquired idiopathic TTP. ADAMTS-13 enzyme activity and inhibitor levels, VWF multimers and platelet count were analysed in correlation with patients\u2019 outcome. ADAMTS-13 activity and inhibitor level at baseline could not differentiate the response of TTP patients\u2019 response to plasma exchange therapy. the study was closed prematurely due to removal of one of the interventional products from the market. primary safety outcome was change in haemoglobin concentration. secondary outcomes were direct antiglobulin test, complement activation, free haemoglobin, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating coagulation variables. 60 healthy adult volunteers received single transfusions of 1,200 mL of the parent product (Octaplas\u00ae) in period 1 and of the LG plasma product (Octaplas LG\u00ae) in period 2 or vice versa. plasmapheresis (600 mL) preceded transfusion. 60 subjects received single transfusions of 1,200 mL of Octaplas\u00ae (in period 1) and the LG plasma product (in period 2) or vice versa. all 90% confidence intervals were within the equivalency interval (10% to 10%) protein S was assayed showed no increase in the concentration of this haemostatic protein. plasmaSafe\u00ae is a pharmaceutical-like product with a standardised content of coagulation factors, effective in correcting coagulation defects and in treating patients with TTP. the use of riboflavin for inactivation of pathogens in blood products is well within the accepted norm. amotosalen treatment is an effective method for treating plasma. riboflavin light treatment Poor evidence on the effectiveness of riboflavin light treatment technology when used on plasma. clinical studies using Mirasol\u00ae (riboflavin) pathogen inactivation technology is still underway. the 49 patients with coagulation deficits due to liver disease were randomly assigned to receive either FFP or SD-FFP. each patient developed one or more deep vein thrombosis while receiving 100% SD-FFP or 50% SD-FFP and 50% cryosupernatant plasma as replacement fluid. each patient developed one or more deep vein thrombosis while receiving 100% SD-FFP or 50% SD-FFP. the use of MB-FFP was associated with a 56% increase in the aggregated demand for plasma. the transfusion of non-virus-inactivated cryoprecipitate doubled the first year and increased by three times the second year. the use of MB-FFP to treat TTP seems to be associated with a higher number of plasma exchange sessions. the use of MB-FFP to treat TTP seems to be associated with a higher number of plasma exchange sessions and greater transfusion requirements without improving clinical results. significant reductions in plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex levels caused by both types of plasma can indicate a reduction in hyperfibrinolysis. no significant difference in clinical haemostasis between the two treatment regimens. the levels increased to 23.5 vs 4.7 g/mL (D-dimer, p=0.002) and 161 vs 57 mg/L (fibrinogen degradation products, p=0.001) the amount of plasma received per packed red blood cell concentrate, clotting tests and levels of individual clotting factors were not significantly different between the groups. alvarez-Larr\u00e1n et al. (2004)169 studied 56 episodes of TTP treated with MB-FFP (27 episodes) as an alternative to FFP. patients who received MB-FFP had an higher risk of death from progressive TTP (OR=31; 95% CI: 1.2 to >100), than those treated with FFP. authors concluded that MB-FFP seems less effective than FFP in the treatment of TTP. a patient who developed a pulmonary embolism during treatment with MB-FFP for a suspected haemarthrosis had homozygous inherited FV deficiency. after 8 days of treatment the patient developed severe respiratory failure and the anticoagulant therapy was suspended due to a suspicion of pulmonary haemorrhage. an inferior vena cava filter was placed and corticosteroid therapy was started, leading to a diagnosis of TRALI. controlled, double-blind phase III trial was conducted by Mintz et al. (2006)172 with A-FFP or control FFP for therapeutic plasma exchange in patients with TTP. patients were treated with FFP for a maximum of 35 days until remission was achieved plus an additional 5 days after remission. inogen were 1.3, 1.2, 1.5, 1.3 and 1.5 dL/kg, respectively. all patients underwent replacement therapy for elective procedures at risk of bleeding. SD-FFP treatment was judged fully effective in 13/16 cases (81%) 8,500 units of MB-FFP were issued for transfusion. 88 units were evaluated for coagulation factor activity and cytokine concentrations. post-MB treatment values of fibrinogen and FV and FVIII appeared to be correlated with their pre-MB values. the use of MB-FFP was associated with a lower likelihood of remission on day 8 (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.06\u20130.47) and a higher risk of recurrence while on treatment (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.6\u201310.8) use of blood products ranging from no transfusion to combined transfusion of red blood cells, platelets and Octaplas\u00ae was associated with a significant increase in post-operative stroke incidence. experimental group (30 patients) were treated with Mirasol\u00ae-inactivated FFP. control group (30 patients) were transfused with non-inactivated FFP. 68 units of FFP were transfused to patients in the control group (2.240.83 units/patient) in cirrhotic patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, SD-FFP provides the same clinical results as FFP, but with a significant reduction in the amount of plasma transfused. the results examined were the volume of plasma transfused during transplantation, intraoperative blood loss, correction of haemostasis variables. patients with TTP 3 100% of patients achieved complete remission. all patients were in stable remission 1 year later. SD-FFP is an efficacious source of coagulation factors. low/moderate de la Rubia J, 2001 Patients with TTP Total 20 13 patients received standard FFP (group A) 7 patients received MB-FFP (group B) Bilirubin values were higher in group A (217 vs 113, p0.01) Mean duration of hospitalisation was also longer (3712 days vs 2211 days (p0.01) Remission rate was higher in group A than B (69% vs 57%). moderate Hambleton J, 2002 Healthy volunteers anticoagulated with warfarin Total 54: 27 treated with A-FFP vs 27 treated with FFP Parameters: - t50 (h); - clearance; - recovery; - volume of distribution No statistically significant differences. kinetic properties of short-lived factor VII remained the same in FFP prepared with a method for inactivation of infectious pathogens as in standard FFP. SD-FFP (n=36) - FFP (n=31) plasma levels following administration of SD-FFP or FFP were significantly different (p=0.0002) the levels of plasmin-PI complexes dropped as a result of treatment (SD-FFP, p=0.001; FFP, p=0.0002) the difference in mortality between groups was statistically significant (p=0.040). patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders 17 SD-plasma was effective in 13/16 cases (81%) MB-FFP units 88 units out of a total of 8,500 MB-FFP units produced and issued for transfusion Losses after MB inactivation and leucoreduction. Q-FFP (n=39) Remission on day 8 of treatment (69% Q-FFP vs 38% MB-FFP, p=0.002) Recrudescence, 29 MB-FFP (46%) vs 8 (20%) Q-FFP (p=0.02). N. of plasma exchanges to remission 11 (2\u201352) MB-FFP vs 5 (2\u201325) Q-FFP (p=0.002) transfusion of two plasma units was 0.66 (range, 0.33\u20131.68) for R-FFP and 0.83 (range, 0.32\u20132.40) for FFP. there was a significant difference (p0.001) in the increase of INR values. MB-FFP: 2,254 (1,446\u20134,148) - SD-FFP 1,905 (1,400\u20133,259) - Q-FFP 1,798 (1,289\u20133,468) no significant differences were found in changes in fibrinogen, factor V, and prothrombin time among the three arms. in vitro studies analysed 12 plasma pools, 12 batches of SD-treated plasma. stability of fibrinogen, FV, FVII, and FVIII after thawing, storage at room temperature and storage at +4 \u00b0C was also examined. FVIII function or activity, VWF activity, VWF antigen, VWF multimeric structure, fibrinogen, and FXIII were analysed in paired samples of control fresh (untreated) plasma and of the same fresh plasma treated with MB. plasma was frozen within 8 hours of collection, thawed, MB photo-inactivated. fresh plasma (16 units) and plasma leucoreduced before freezing (19 units) were MB inactivated. neither MB removal filter resulted in significant loss of activity of any factor studied. leucofiltered and virally inactivated in a standardised way. control plasma samples were obtained after filtration but before MB light treatment. thrombin clotting time increased by 6 seconds after MB light treatment. the optical density values of stored Octaplas\u00ae were more stable during the storage period than those of FFP. the study results suggest that Octaplas\u00ae maintains high quality levels for 8 hours when stored at +4 \u00b0C. treatment expressed as a proportion of pre-treatment (baseline) activity was 72 to 73% of baseline fibrinogen and FVIII activity. 78 to 98% for FII, FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and 2-antiplasmin. levels of inactivation expressed as log-reduction were cell-free HIV-1, greater than 6.8; cell-associated HIV-1, greater than 6.4; no clear-cut correlation between coagulation factor levels in MB-FFP and impaired thrombin generation capacity was found. ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lower in cryosupernatant [median [range]: 87% (70\u2013107%)] than in FFP (p0.05). global haemostasis was assessed by a thrombin generation test. mean levels of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII and XIII, VWF antigen, antithrombin, protein C and free protein S were all >75 U/dL. FII, FVII, FVIII, FIX, and FXIII levels did not differ significantly in SD-FFP. higher concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-, IL-8, and IL-10 were found in FFP. the average percent protein retention in R-FFP samples after 1 year of storage was 103%; FII, 88%; FVII and FXI, 62%; FV 60%; FVIII and FIX, 77%; fibrinogen, 75%; FX, 85%; and FXII, 82%. the results after 6 months (double the European Union guidelines\u2019 recommended storage time) showed that all proteins were well preserved. ifugation method contain levels of fibrinogen, FVIII and VWF ristocetin cofactor activity. clotting factor levels and bacterial contamination were investigated using 20 units of SD plasma. bacterial contamination was found in thawed SD plasma. all clotting factors in thawed SD plasma remained stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 4 \u00b0C. the efficacy and safety of SD plasma is not impaired by reduced activities of protein S and plasmin inhibitor. MB-treated plasma could turn plasma itself and the cryoprecipitates obtained from it into a useful therapeutic option for the treatment of von Willebrand disease. Thawed Octaplas maintains its high quality, even with a time safety margin, for 8 h at +4 \u00b0C and for 6 h at room temperature. Fibrinogen antigen: increased by 2% after MB inactivation (p=0.0058) P II, 3 Uniplas\u00ae FFP vs MB-FFP I (B), FFP vs MB-FFP I (D), MB-FFP I vs MB-FFP II (E), MB-FFP II (F), MB-FFP I vs II (F) all clotting factors in thawed SD-FFP remain stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 4 \u00b0C. storage of thawed SD-FFP may improve availability in emergency situations. in thawed SD-FFP stored for 24 hours at 4 \u00b0C. low/moderate Ettinger A, 2012 74 Fibrinogen: 295102 control. paired t-tests and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. mean levels of FII, FXII, FXIII, VWF antigen, ADAMTS-13, D-dimers, and protein C were statistically equivalent in A-FFP and MB-FFP at all three time points. thrombin time was shorter for A-FFP than for MB-FFP (p0.05). MB-FFP exhibited higher FIX retention than the A-FFP after 24 hours of storage at 4 \u00b0C after thawing (p0.05). randomised trial was intended to compare outcome in 280 patients treated with either cryosupernatant or SD plasma. primary end-point was survival at 6 months. ADAMTS-13 enzyme activity and inhibitor levels varied considerably among patients. plasmapheresis preceded infusion of 1,200 mL of Uniplas LG\u00ae or 1,200 mL of Octaplas LG\u00ae or vice versa. the primary safety outcome was variation in haemoglobin concentration. the universal plasma represents an advance over the currently available blood group-specific plasma transfusion products. the universal plasma represents an advance over the currently available blood group-specific plasma transfusion products. coagulation factors and haemostatic variables over time were within the normal range and similar with the two treatments. 90% CI for the derived recovery data were within predefined limits of equivalence. Octaplas LG\u00ae demonstrated comparable safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers. de Silvestro et al. (2007)55 evaluated the clinical effectiveness of plasmasafe\u00ae in 490 patients (879 transfusion events); performed pre- and post-treatment monitoring of indices of coagulation (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, proteins S and C, FVIII) in 15 patients; and treated three TTP patients undergoing plasma-exchange. plasmaSafe\u00ae is a pharmaceutical-like product with a standardised content of coagulation factors. low/moderate TTP: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; PT: prothrombin time; aPT: activated partial thromboplastin time. thrombosis or hyperfibrinolytic bleeding triggered by reduced protein S or low plasmin inhibitor potencies have not withstood critical review. the first developed method to inactivate enveloped viruses in plasma protein preparations was SD treatment. the major advantages of SD plasma over FFP are its extreme safety with respect to TRALI and the significantly lower likelihood of allergic reactions. transfusion has long been directed towards preventing the transmission of infections, particularly HBV, HCV and HIV. the procedures used for this purpose are highly effective, but a zero-risk level has not been reached. improvements in the sensitivity of tests, such as NAT, have contributed significantly to decreasing this risk. the clinical events are classified into three macro-classes: non-infective, infective and mixed (Table XVI)198. most frequent adverse events occurring during transfusion of plasma. the rates of ATR associated with FFP in two retrospective studies were 1:591 and 1:2.184 plasma units transfused200. other common causes of adverse events associated with the transfusion of plasma are errors. d viruses Incomplete removal of the reagent Does not inactivate prions Possible removal of leucocytes A-FFP Single unit pathogen-reduced plasma Photochemical treatment; \u201cin house\u201d Not inactivation of emerging viruses Effect regarding prion inactivation is not known FFP: fresh-frozen plasma; SD-FFP: solvent/detergent-treated FFP; R-FFP: riboflavin-treated FFP; HAV: transfusion-related acute lung no safety-specific search was performed in the Cochrane and CDR databases. a manual search of the references of selected literature, documents released by monitoring authorities (haemovigilance) and grey literature included in safety research. literature was searched using the \u201cGoogle Scholar\u201d search engine. a number of elements in the reference lists of selected articles were also evaluated. the definitions of clinical and processing safety outcomes are reported in Table XVIII. at least one component received by the infected recipient was donated by a donor who had evidence of the same transmissible infection. at least one component received by the infected recipient was shown to contain the agent of infection. a patient is transfused with plasma that was intended for another patient. the patient was transfused with a blood component intended for that patient. but during the transfusion process, the handling and storage may have rendered the component less safe for transfusion. decision leading to the transfusion is flawed, - a transfusion of blood was clinically indicated but not undertaken or significantly delayed. a total of 17 studies of the primary literature search were eventually included in the analysis. the secondary literature search, which included grey literature (such as haemovigilance reports) led to the detection 35 further studies. the level of evidence of the studies was appraised by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale. no seroconversion for HTLA, CMV, parvovirus B19, HIV, HBV or HCV was observed in 201 patients transfused with SD-FFP or in 55 patients transfused with FFP. the adverse events and safety of SD-FFP and FFP were comparable to those of FP or FFP. the authors of one study concluded that the impact of the two alternatives on the Canadian Health Service could not be determined. incidence of adverse reactions following transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) or methylene blue-treated fresh-frozen plasma (MB-FFP) no TRALI or seroconversion was reported in relation to either MB-FFP or FFP. MB-FFP is safer than FFP Low/moderate AR: allergic reactions; SAR: serious allergic reactions; TRALI: transfusion-related acute lung injury. no TRALI or seroconversion was reported in relation to either MB-FFP or FFP. the authors reported that no patient resulted positive to A-FFP antibodies. Table XXIII shows the number of mild and moderated acute reactions associated with transfusions of A-FFP. a limited literature search was conducted on major databases. one randomised controlled trial on the safety of A-FFP compared to that of FFP was also included. no comparative studies between the technologies analysed were included in the report. skin rash 7 Urticaria 16 Bronchospasm 3 Chills 3 Nausea 1 Moderate: Urticaria 3 Haemoglobinuria 1 Chills 4 Nausea 2 Cazenave JP, 2010 Case series 3,232 transfusions with A-FFP Adverse events The total number of adverse events was very low and the authors concluded that the relevance of the treatment of A-FFP regarding these events is dubious. an effective haemovigilance system collects and reports transfusion-related adverse reactions and events for a rigorous management of the information related to the transfusion process. not all haemovigilance programmes collect the same type of information. in the united kingdom and in Ireland they only collect information on the most serious risks connected to transfusions, while in france they collect all haemovigilance data, regardless of the severity of the reactions. german haemovigilance clinical data The Paul-Ehrlich-Institute211 summarised data reported since 2010. compared the data of the preceding 13 years (1997\u20132009) with the current haemovigilance data. 96106 1.152106 Serious acute (allergic) TR (grade III and IV) 0.47 (3) 2.51 (12) 2.91 (13) 13.69 (15) 17.36 (20) Immune-mediated TRALI 1.42 (9) 5.23 (25) 11.18 (50) 4.56 (5) 0 TTI (bacterial)** 0.63 (4) 0 0.22 (1) 0 0 TTI (viral) 1.42 (9 HCV transmissions) 0.63 (3 HBV transmissions) 0 0 0 FFP a total of 80 cases associated with plasma transfusions were confirmed during the period 2006\u20132010. 75% of these were immune-mediated and 25% were non-immune-mediated. the rate of TRALI per million units transfused was 12.7 in 2006/2007. the authors concluded that a significant reduction of immune-mediated TRALI has been achieved through the implementation of risk minimisation measures. the UK haemovigilance report SHOT collects and analyses anonymised information on adverse events and reactions to blood transfusion. total acute transfusion reactions in the UK in the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. 2010 2011 2012 2013 FFP SD-FFP MB-FFP MB-FFP FFP SD-FFP MB-FFP FFP SD-FFP MB-FFP Unclassified 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hypotensive 3 0 0 2 0 0 2* 0 0 3 1 0 Mixed allergic/febrile 2 0 TAD associated with anaphylactic reactions; FFP: fresh-frozen plasma; SD-FFP: solvent/detergent-treated FFP. Table XXXIII. Total transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) associated with plasma in the UK in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. acute transfusion reactions In 2011, SD-FFP was implicated in three reactions. in the united kingdom rates of TRALI remained lower than in 2003\u20132004. no cases of TACO were associated with SD-FFP or MB-FFP in the united kingdom during the period 2010\u20132013. the most frequent ATR are anaphylactic and allergic reactions and are uniquely associated with SD-FFP and MB-FFP. the most frequent ATR are anaphylactic and anaphylactic TR 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 TRALI 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 TTI (bacterial) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 over 99% of all plasma transfused in Ireland has been subjected to a pathogen reduction process in the form of SD-FFP (Octaplas\u00ae) the use of SD-FFP is safe and the rare adverse reactions are ATR and TACO. the total risk of allergic transfusion reactions to plasma increased in 2012 compared to 2011. in 2013, there were 23 (3% of total) high-imputability reactions to plasma tranffusion and the total risk of allergic transfusion reactions to plasma increased to 1:2,600. ND 83,163 SD-FFP, 52,692 A-FFP, 246,460 MB-FFP. ND: no data; FFP: fresh-frozen plasma; SD-FFP: solvent/detergent-treated FFP; Q-FFP: quarantined FFP; amotosalen-treated FFP. MB plasma was withdrawn from the french market from 1st March, 2012. many retrospective studies conducted in Greece, UK, Spain and Austria report rare allergic events. in a retrospective study conducted in a single centre in Austria, Nussbaumer et al. (2012) found a significantly lower incidence of adverse events due to MB plasma than to Q-FFP. the total number of severe allergic/anaphylactic reactions following transfusions of MB-FFP is very low and that the rate of severe reactions to plasma was always below 1 per 4,700224.

MB-FFP has been introduced in 2008, and relevant numbers of MB-FFP units were used in 2009 for the first time. these imbalances in the use of the different types of FFP limit the validity of comparative analyses.

Table LI describes the recommendations of \u201cThe Transfusion of Plasma in Adults\u201d guidelines of the San Giovanni Hospital of Turin201. E* Plasma should not be used to correct deficiencies of coagulation factors when there are specific completely inactivated or recombinant factors. the SD-method of inactivating pathogens in plasma generally has a low toxicity for biological components and low permanent binding. amotosalen bound to lipids and 2% to proteins Does not appear to bind. a better understanding of donors\u2019 medical histories and the performance of blood tests have decreased the risk of transmitting infections by transfusion of blood products. improvements in the sensitivity of tests, such as NAT, have contributed significantly to decreasing this risk. systematic surveillance encompasses the entire transfusion chain. the clinical events are classified into three macro-classes: non-infective, infective and mixed (Table XVI)198. the most frequent adverse events occurring during transfusion of plasma. the rates of ATR associated with FFP in two retrospective studies were 1:591 and 1:2.184 plasma units transfused200. other common causes of adverse events associated with the transfusion of plasma are errors. inactivation of enveloped viruses Inactivation of non-enveloped viruses Inactivation of non-enveloped viruses Inactivation of lymphocytes Incomplete removal of inactivating agent and its products R-FFP Single unit pathogen reduced plasma Photochemical treatment. no safety-specific search was performed in the Cochrane and CDR databases. a manual search of the references of selected literature, documents released by monitoring authorities (haemovigilance) and grey literature was included in the safety research. the definitions of clinical and processing safety outcomes are reported in Table XVIII. the definitions of clinical and processing safety outcomes are reported in Table XVIII.

Descriptions of clinical and processing safety outcomes. a donor who had evidence of the same transmissible infection was shown to contain the agent of infection. at least one component received by the infected recipient was shown to contain the agent of infection. a patient is transfused with plasma that was intended for another patient. a transfusion of blood was clinically indicated but was not undertaken or significantly delayed. there was avoidable use of emergency blood when group-specific or crossmatched blood was readily available for the patient HBV: hepatitis B virus. no safety-specific search was performed in the Cochrane and CDR databases. a manual search of the references of selected literature, documents released by monitoring authorities (haemovigilance) and grey literature included in the safety research. the list of european haemovigilance systems was obtained from the web-site of the international haemovigilance network. grey literature was searched using the \u201cGoogle Scholar\u201d search engine. a number of elements in the reference lists of selected articles were also evaluated. the respiratory distress should not be explained by the patient\u2019s underlying condition or any other known cause. transfusion-transmitted infections An infection is classified as transfusion-transmitted if, following investigation: - the recipient had evidence of infection following transfusion with blood components. at least one component received by the infected recipient was shown to contain the agent of infection. administration with incorrect or incomplete/missing patient\u2019s details on the label Transposition of labels between units intended for the same patient Absence of a patient\u2019s identification wristband Transfusion of a blood component that was intended for the patient. during the transfusion process, the handling and storage may have rendered the component less safe for transfusion. decision leading to the transfusion is flawed, - a transfusion of blood was clinically indicated but not undertaken or significantly delayed. literature search revealed 497 potentially relevant citations for the safety domain evaluation. nine studies were excluded because they were not in English and four because they were duplicate. 102 studies included were then screened by reading their abstracts and full texts. a total of 64 further studies were excluded because alternatives compared, outcomes or the study design were not consistent with the aim of this analysis. no seroconversion for HTLA, CMV, parvovirus B19, HIV, HBV or HCV. Chekrizova V, 2006 Multicentre observational study Liver transplantation/disease 32 N/A No adverse events were observed. no seroconversion for HIV, HBV or HCV was observed in 201 patients transfused with SD-FFP or in 55 patients transfused with FFP. a patient in the FFP group showed seroconversion for PVB19 but no patient transfused with SD-FFP had this complication. 25 adverse reactions, five of which were classified as serious, were recorded in patients treated with MB-FFP. the serious adverse reactions were: - two cases of anaphylactic shock in patients not previously known to be IgA deficient. methylene blue-treated fresh-frozen plasma (MB-FFP) vs untreated fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). MB-FFP is safer than FFP Low/moderate AR: allergic reactions; SAR: serious allergic reactions; TRALI: transfusion-related acute lung injury. thirty patients received 77 transfusions of pathogen-inactivated plasma during surgery. reactions were classified as mild if there were no changes in the patient\u2019s capability to carry out activities, moderate if some change occurred, and severe in the case that important impairments to the performance of usual activities developed. one case of nausea was considered to be serious, resulting in a medical emergency. a systematic review209 compared the safety of MB-FFP to A-FFP (Mirasol\u00ae Pathogen Reduction Technology) a limited literature search was conducted on major databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ECRI, EuroScan, international health technology agencies. methylene blue-treated fresh-frozen plasma (MB-FFP) vs amotosalen-treated fresh-frozen plasma (A-FFP) the authors concluded that the safety profile of A-FFP was not different from that of control FFP. the authors concluded that the safety profile of A-FFP was not different from that of control FFP. a haemovigilance system requires traceability of blood and blood products from donors to transfused patients. an effective haemovigilance system is bi-directional tracking that collects and reports transfusion-related adverse reactions and events for a rigorous management of the information related to the transfusion process. not all haemovigilance programmes collect the same type of information. serious adverse reactions were reported by the 28 Member States, Liechtenstein and Norway. the report did not specify whether the units of plasma were pathogen-inactivated and, if so, which method had been used for the inactivation. the serious adverse reactions were not split by type210. in 2010 29 events were confirmed, 20 of which were classified as serious. in 2009 and 2010 no bacterial and viral infections were reported. data before and after the introduction of risk-minimisation measures (2008\u20132009) were compared. the risk minimisation strategies, limited to FFP, consisted of: - use of female donors without a history of pregnancy for the production of FFP. - use of female donors without a history of pregnancy but without detectable white blood cell antibodies for FFP production. the reported rate of TRALI-induced fatalities decreased from 2.97 cases per million FFP units transfused in 2006\u20132007 to 2.13 cases per million FFP units transfused in 2008\u20132009. the authors concluded that a significant reduction of immune-mediated TRALI has been achieved through the implementation of risk minimisation measures.

Q-FFP, SD-FFP, and MB-FFP were not included in the analysis because of the relatively low numbers of units for this period. Q-FFP and A-FFP were not included in the analysis because of the relatively low number of units for this period. the authors showed that when the 2010 haemovigilance data were included in the analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidences of severe allergic reactions associated with the different types of plasma. they concluded that the currently available haemovigilance data do not support the hypothesis of additional allergenic mechanisms specifically related to the MB/light pathogen inactivation process. authors concluded that FFP is safe and plasma inactivation with SD, MB or amotosalen can lead to fewer adverse events than those associated with Q-FFP. all types of FFP were associated with extremely low incidence of adverse events. the authors concluded that the adverse effects of particular relevance for patients are probably TRALI and sepsis, due to inadvertent bacterial contamination. the authors concluded that the adverse effects of particular relevance for patients are probably TRALI and sepsis. use of MB-FFP in 2001\u20132011 was 290,951 units. 73,778 (25.4%) were MB-FFP units. no deaths related to plasma transfusions were reported. the incidence of adverse events was lower with MB-FFP (1:24,593) than with Q-FFP (1:3,620). other adverse events, such as 18 febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions, 6 leucoreduced post-storage at the bedside (1:7,601) and three leucoreduced pre-storage (1:28,956) were reported for Q-FFP. the data on Finnish immunological reactions were not published in the haemovigilance report. the authors determined that the number of cases of TRALI in other countries that use SD-FFP method is greater than in Norway. non-fatal TRALI cases associated with plasma transfusion decreased significantly in 2008 compared to 2006 (6 cases; p=0.01) and 2007 (5 cases; p=0.03) the incidence of TRALI associated with plasma decreased by approximately 80% in 2008 with respect to 2006. the frequency of each adverse effect was recalculated per 10,000 transfusions. non-haemolytic transfusion reaction 0.22 (Danish data); 0.35 (French data); 2.35 (Quebec data) TACO 0.1 (Danish data); 2.06 (French data); 0.02 (Quebec data) Sepsis due to inadvertent bacterial contamination 0.02 (French data); 0 (Quebec data) TR the authors concluded that the adverse effects of particular relevance for patients are probably TRALI and sepsis, due to inadvertent bacterial contamination. the total clinical use of FFP in the study period 2001\u20132011 was 290,951 units. the rate per 10,000 units of MB-FFP was estimated to be 0.41 with a 95% CI of 0.10\u20131.06. there were no serious adverse reactions (grade 2 or 3) to MB-FFP. other adverse events, such as 18 febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions, were classified as mild. the results considered were immunological transfusion reactions, in particular TRALI. in 2004, there were 241 reports of transfusion complications in Norway. the number of immunological transfusion reactions associated with the transfusion of SD plasma was two (5:100,000 transfusions), of which only one was classified as a serious complication. suspected TRALI cases reported to the American Red Cross in 2006, 2007 and 2008. in total, the American Red Cross distributed 1,638,055 plasma components in 2006, 1,702,419 in 2007, and 1,729,128 in 2008. non-fatal TRALI cases associated with plasma transfusions in the USA. the aim of the american red cross was to continue the assessment of the effectiveness of the male-predominant plasma donor strategy. there are always risks of HIV, HCV and HBV infections in relation to blood and plasma transfusions. however, these risks appear to be low in all developed countries. the rate of immune-mediated TRALI decreased during the transitional period: - 12.7/1,000,000 in 2006/2007 - 6.81/1,000,000 in 2008/2009 No cases in 2010.

Riedler et al.235 also included the risk of severe or minor allergic reactions. the higher age of plasma recipients and their poor short-term prognosis are important factors that negatively influence the cost-effectiveness of virus-inactivated plasma. the widespread implementation of these approaches may have significant public health and economic implications. in publicly-funded health care systems, such as the Italian one, finite resources imply that not all possible technologies can be provided in any situation for all those who may need or want them. the search strategy was based on cost, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, economic evaluation, ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) the search strategy was based on cost, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, economic evaluation, ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). literature search was conducted to obtain economic data on technical approaches to pathogen inactivation of FFP for transfusion use. a literature search was conducted to obtain economic data on technical approaches to pathogen inactivation of FFP. the search strategy was: ECONOMIC DOMAIN ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( results Results Results Results Results of the literature search The literature search revealed 343 citations that were potentially relevant for the economic domain. 316 were excluded because not relevant to the research question. eight studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. three economic studies and the CADTH report63 described both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. authors also reported results in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained236,238,241. two economic studies also reported only cost-utility analyses. hepatitis, follow-up of chronic hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis and AIDS. Riedler et al.235 and the CADTH63 estimated only costs associated with TRALI. the most important driver of cost-effectiveness was TRALI, because of its relatively high incidence and associated mortality rate. a unit of SD-FFP produced a net benefit of 35 minutes expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy. the ICER of SD-FFP was $ 289,300 per QALY, with an incremental cost of $ 142.5 million per 147 incremental QALY. the authors concluded that virus-inactivated plasma produced benefits but at a very high cost. the cost increment of using SD-FFP instead of FFP was $ 75.00 per unit. the cost per death prevented was approximately $17,000,000 dollars. SD plasma was a comparatively expensive approach to reduce mortality from transfusion complications. s\u00ae replaced all forms of FFP, plasma from ongoing donations would go for fractionation. in relative terms the yearly net loss would be C$ 13.5 million. the high incremental cost per QALY resulted from low transfusion-related risks for FP or FFP. ALI was most cost-effective in children, as a result of their long life expectancy. cost-effectiveness ratios were lower than those previously reported238,239. if a value of \u00a3 50,000/LYS is taken as an \u201cacceptable\u201d cost-effectiveness threshold, the model suggests SD-FFP is a cost-effective treatment for all patients up to the age of 48. the cost per life year and QALY gained were \u00a3 968,909 ($ 1,535,654) and \u00a3 868,172 ($ 1,375,993) since TRALI is underreported in SHOT242 these results need to be interpreted with caution. the cost of using Octaplas\u00ae rather than FFP was reduced. the second scenario analysis using a historic (lower) price of FFP showed that Octaplas\u00ae would have been cost-effective in comparison to FFP even if the latter had not undergone a price increase over the last 5 years. Octaplas\u00ae yielded 0.0007 additional life years (95% CI: 0.0003\u20130.0012) and 0.013 additional QALY (95% CI: 0.007\u20130.019) compared to FFP at a lower cost (C$ 148.09 vs C$ 761.00) the authors also performed a budget impact analysis. three economic studies and the CADTH report63 described both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. the authors also reported results in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained236,238,241.

Riedler et al.235 used a decision-tree model simulating a hypothetical cohort of patients aged up to 70 years. in neonates it amounted to \u00a3 22,728 while in the population 70 years old it was \u00a3 98,465. the cost/LYS was very sensitive to variations in incidence of TRALI. study showed SD-FFP was most cost-effective in children as a result of their long life expectancy. the cost-effectiveness ratios calculated in this study were lower than the ones previously reported238,239, which ignored non-infectious events such as TRALI. the model suggests SD-FFP is a cost-effective treatment for all patients up to the age of 48. the cost per life year and QALY gained were \u00a3 968,909 ($ 1,535,654) and \u00a3 868,172 ($ 1,375,993) since TRALI is underreported in SHOT242 these results need to be interpreted with caution. the study suggested that Octaplas\u00ae represents good value for money vs FFP. aplas\u00ae was reduced as the risk of this complication was zero for both products. the second scenario analysis using a historic (lower) price of FFP showed that Octaplas\u00ae would have been cost-effective in comparison to FFP even if the latter had not undergone a price increase. 0.0007 additional life years (95% CI: 0.0003\u20130.0012) and 0.013 additional QALY (95% CI: 0.007\u20130.019) compared to FFP at a lower cost (C$ 148.09 vs C$ 761.00) Octaplas\u00ae had an ICER of C$ 2,551 per life year and C$ 1,085 per QALY gained, far below the generally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold. $ 2,156,398/QALY Virus-inactivated plasma produces little incremental benefit and very high incremental cost due to low current risk of infection with transfusion-transmitted viruses. the advanced age and poor short-term prognosis of most plasma recipients Blumberg N, 2000 USA, Baxter, Pall Biomedical, Ortho Biotech P: N/A I: SD-FFP was a comparatively expensive approach to reduce mortality from transfusion complications CADTH, 2011 Canada.

MB-FFP is contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women, premature babies and for intrauterine transfusions, patients with severe renal failure, patients with severe renal failure. the contraindications to R-FFP and SD-FFP are the same as those to FFP58,86. the contraindications to SD-FFP are the same as those to FFP58,86. the contraindications to SD-FFP are the same as those to

process of donor recruitment and screening, and collection and preparation of blood units are performed in a primary care setting. a centralised storage site enables a more streamlined system of governance of the plasma. pathogen inactivation involves standardisation of procedures that reduce associated risks and facilitate control255,278. cost drivers in all processes are related to adverse events derived from plasma transfusion. research shows that the organisational model and network generated around SD-FFP creates a better structured and controllable organisational environment. this greater control is of benefit not only to the safety of the final product (industrial pathogen inactivation is guaranteed by GMP authorisation from national health authorities) but also to the planning of regional and national governmental bodies that have the goal of ensuring plasma self-sufficiency13,241,245. the risk-benefit balance and cost-effectiveness of PRT could be positive in the long run283. the gradual introduction of PRT into guidelines worldwide can be taken as a measure of the adoption and diffusion of these technologies. many studies have investigated organisational aspects of PRT. method guarantees standardisation of the final product. in europe, quality control and validation of procedures for producing pathogen-inactivated FFP are guided by the guidelines of the european community and the EMA. this fact underlies the difference between the regulatory systems for the two groups of technologies. in europe, quality control and validation of procedures for producing pathogen-inactivated FFP are guided. the aim of this section is to discuss the impact of the implementation of any kind of PRT for plasma (SD-FFP, MB-FFP, A-FFP, R-FFP) on organisational aspects (i.e. workflow, work process, patient flow, centralisation or decentralisation, human resources, training, collaboration, communication, teamwork, management) inclusion criteria Publications

retrieved using the search process. further scientific papers and different types of literature were retrieved from other sources specified in the methods section and included according to inclusion criteria. transfusion chain is a process that covers the whole pathway of plasma, from its extraction from the donor to the actual transfusion and follow-up. the steps of this process are common to all FFP, pathogen-inactivated or not. blood donors are selected based on their history and clinical evaluation. plasma is fractionated by high speed centrifugation (preferably within 6 hours of collection and no later than 18 hours for cool blood units) all products are packed separately in pre-connected bags. collected plasma is rapidly frozen to 30 \u00b0C, which is the recommended temperature for storage. samples of 60\u2013380 L of plasma are then pooled to create a standardised biopharmaceutical product with uniform plasma protein concentrations. batches of 60\u2013380 L of plasma are then pooled to create a standardised biopharmaceutical product. the plasma is then packed and refrozen86. inactivated plasma is transported in certified vehicles at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C or below76,256,257. the pathogen inactivation process is carried out within the hospital blood centre. the decision to perform a transfusion must be based on clinical practice guidelines. all plasma and plasma products In Europe, Directive 2002/98/EC254,257\u2013263 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27th January 2003 sets standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components. activities related to blood components and production and transfusion of plasma derivatives are regulated in Italy by

plasma-derived products (EMA)270 do not allow the clinical use of plasma and plasma the process of donor recruitment and screening is performed in blood establishments where \u201cin-house\u201d pathogen inactivation procedures are performed. the SD-FFP method for pathogen inactivation is standardised and carried out at a centralised manufacturing centre where plasma is processed as a large pool (500\u20132,500 donations) and provided to users frozen in 200 mL bags35. dilution and neutralisation of antibodies and allergens during the industrial process of SD plasma pooling can reduce the incidence of allergic reactions and TRALI in recipients. it has been reported that the transition from FFP to SD-treated plasma significantly reduces the incidence of adverse reactions. a series of concerns within the medical community limited the acceptance and diffusion of pathogen inactivation when it was an emerging technology. there were doubts about blood safety including risks resulting from the presence of residual chemicals in the final product. there were doubts about blood safety including risks resulting from the presence of residual chemicals in the final product. a total of 110 records were retrieved using the search process. following review, three of these scientific papers were eventually included in the present analysis. transfusion chain is a process that covers the whole pathway of plasma, from its extraction from the donor to the actual transfusion and follow-up. the steps of this process are common to all FFP, pathogen-inactivated or not, are: (i) collection; (ii) testing and other procedures to minimise risk of infections; (iv) storage; (v) distribution; and (vi) transfusion. companies authorised to fractionate blood collected in Italy are indicated in Table LVI252. companies authorised to fractionate blood collected in Italy and locations of their respective industrial establishments are indicated in Table LVI. batches of 60\u2013380 L of plasma are then pooled to create a standardised biopharmaceutical product with uniform plasma protein concentrations. a sample of the pool is tested for infections and the inactivation process is applied to the whole pool. all industrial processes must respect quality requirements set by the european GMP and must obtain Plasma Master File certification253\u2013255. MB-FFP is contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women, premature babies and for intrauterine transfusions. the contraindications to R-FFP and SD-FFP are the same as those to FFP58,86. the limits of selecting donors are well known, including those concerning the recognition of donors at risk of transmission of prions responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) all products are packed separately in pre-connected bags. plasma is rapidly frozen to 30 \u00b0C, which is the recommended temperature for storage. these procedures must be designed to avoid contamination and are performed either within hospital blood centres or regional blood centres86. batches of 60\u2013380 L of plasma are pooled to create a standardised biopharmaceutical product with uniform plasma protein concentrations. the plasma is then packed and refrozen86. all industrial processes must respect quality requirements set by the european GMP. the decision to perform a transfusion must be based on clinical practice guidelines. a qualified specialist in transfusion medicine supervises the entire process. each unit must be immersed in a water bath at a maximum temperature of +37 oC or it may be kept for a maximum of 6 hours at +4 oC before transfusion. the directive 2002/98/EC254,257\u2013263 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27th January 2003 sets standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components. the directive 2005/61/EC267 of 30th September 2005 implements Directive 2002/98/EC254 with respect to a quality system for blood establishments. law n. 10 of 26th February 2011 determined the procedures for plasma and all other blood products to be compliant with european standards. law n. 10 of 26th February 2011 determined the procedures for plasma and all other blood products to be compliant with European standards. the agreement between the Italian State and the Regions defined the \u201cStructural, technological and organizational requirements for health care institutions that offer blood transfusion and/or blood collection services\u201d and the \u201cModel for monitoring visits of blood establishments\u201d disposed by Legislative Decree n. 261 of 20th December 2007 (Art. 5), incorporated the European Directive 2002/98/EC. it is therefore mandatory that all regions and autonomous provinces check facilities on-site at least every 2 years. EMA270 does not allow clinical use of plasma and plasma-derived medicinal products after donation reports of CJD. equipment, kits and reagents are CE-labelled and are subject to the regulations for medical devices entering the market. plasma must comply with European Pharmacopoeia Monographs and Good Manufacturing/Laboratory Practices.

- the alternatives to transfusion, which may include the possibility of an autologous transfusion; - clarification of the risks associated with the trans the available cost-effectiveness studies on different pathogen inactivation approaches show contradictory and sometimes incomparable results. most of these studies are limited to the comparison of only two different PRT, i.e. SD and riboflavin. however, it is not possible to determine whether broad implementation of any of the technologies is acceptable in terms of justice. the study does not include this analysis. the working group on ethics oversaw the whole HTA process. the results of the analysis do not explicitly include the set of issues. four focused searches relating to specific issues were found in PubMed. four focused searches relating to specific issues were found in PubMed. sixty-four articles were considered of possible interest. sixty-four articles were considered of possible interest. none contained a section on the ethical domain. but even the contribution of the health council of the Netherlands was considered not relevant. the four PRT currently available for plasma, i.e. SD, MB, amotosalen and riboflavin. the first step in conducting an ethical analysis concerning health technologies is in considering risks (principle of non-maleficence) and benefits. studies on the safety and efficacy of PRT for plasma are difficult to perform. however, long-term side effects remain a matter of debate88. however, studies are particularly difficult to perform in this case. in the field of transfusion medicine, there is lively debate on whether separate informed consent should be obtained from patients for transfusion of blood/blood components and plasma-derived medicinal products. there is generally agreed that the minimum elements to be discussed with a patient before requesting his or her consent to a transfusion should include 303: - clarification of the reason for the transfusion, i.e. the purpose and anticipated benefit of the transfusion; - clarification of the risks associated with the transfusion; - clarification of the cost-effectiveness studies on different pathogen inactivation approaches show contradictory and sometimes incomparable results. most of these studies are limited to the comparison of only two different PRT, i.e. SD and riboflavin. cost-effectiveness studies for plasma need to be performed and new data should be collected. significant progress has been made in reducing or preventing transmission of blood-borne pathogens in plasma by implementing different methods, i.e. PRT. these seem to be a promising alternative to expanded testing of FFP and donor deferral. studies on the safety and efficacy of PRT for plasma should be done. however, only the latter can demonstrate the added value of these technologies. a common system of notification of serious adverse events and reactions should be established in Member States. in the field of transfusion medicine, there is lively debate on whether separate informed consent should be obtained from patients for transfusion of blood/blood components and plasma-derived medicinal products294\u2013302. however, it is generally agreed that the minimum elements to be discussed with a patient before requesting his or her consent to a transfusion should include 303: - clarification of the reason for the transfusion, i.e. the purpose and anticipated benefit of the transfusion; - clarification of the risks associated with the trans cost-effectiveness studies on different pathogen inactivation approaches show contradictory and sometimes incomparable results. most of these studies are limited to the comparison of only two different PRT, i.e. SD and riboflavin. however, it is not possible to determine whether the implementation of any of the technologies is acceptable in terms of justice. analysis of legal aspects of HTA concerning PRT for plasma was carried out at national and european levels. despite different degrees of detail, we found common elements in the discipline of information and consent and access to treatment. SD-FFP was first introduced in 1991 in the german Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. it replaced FFP in 1993 following a successful clinical trial in 1992 in Norway. now, ordinary medicinal licensing is required for SD-FFP in european countries except for France307. Directive 2002/98/EC outlines specific requirements for the processing of blood supplies. it sets out standards for blood establishments in reference to responsibilities, quality management, documentation, record keeping, traceability, adverse events, storage and transport. Directive 2001/83/EC253 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6th November 2001 set out technical requirements for blood and blood products in all Member States. Articles 11\u201313 define a quality system for blood establishments and the requirement to keep a record of the previous year\u2019s activity. in accordance with Annex II of Directive 2002/98/CE254, 22 Member States receive annual reports from blood establishments on the previous year\u2019s activities. EUDAMED contains registration data of manufacturers, authorised representatives and devices. data relating to certificates issued, modified, supplemented, suspended, withdrawn or refused. SISTRA enhances the flow of information between the italian Ministry of Health, the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano and the National Blood Centre. o convention report310 the information must be appropriate with respect to the goals, the nature of the intervention and the potential consequences and risks for the patient. clause 13 and 14 regulate the information to be provided to patients, as well as their informed consent. the declaration of Helsinki is another important document concerning informed consent317. the practice of obtaining a valid consent for blood transfusion is still highly heterogeneous across the country. patients should be informed of potential damages due to the PRT. patients should be informed of residual risks concerning pathogens for which no detection method exists. the right to have access to full information and to safeguard one\u2019s privacy imposes on authorities the duty to guarantee proper, safe access to personal data, as affirmed in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council313. paragraph 1 shall not apply where processing of the data is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, provision of care or treatment or management of health-care services. a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of an official authority. derogations from paragraph 1 provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be notified to the Commission. european dispositions do not establish time limits for the provision of informed consent. effective informed consent implies allowing the patient the time necessary to consider alternatives. there are situations in which a patient\u2019s health state requires immediate action. the european Union has produced many documents on healthcare matters within Member States. the most relevant documents include the 2011/24/UE Directive of the European Parliament and the Council, concerning the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare. it is also worth recalling the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union issued on 28th April 1998. application of guidelines/criteria for appropriate management and clinical utilisation of blood resources is of paramount importance as it represents a fundamental \u201cparallel tool\u201d for blood and blood product self-sufficiency. however, greater legislative uniformity among regions and specific provision for the application of the best PRT are still crucial. a number of models and frameworks can be used to conduct legal assessments within the HTA framework284,287. the legal evaluation was conducted by a group composed of three bioethicists, two of whom are jurists and one a physician. the european regulatory framework, which sets high standards for establishing pathogen reduction and harmonising the procurement of safe blood, is still under development. the french haemovigilance report of 2009 described a relatively higher incidence of allergic events connected to MB-FFP than to Q-FFP. the authors of a case report found evidence of potential cross-reactivity between patent blue V, a food colourant widely used in Europe, and MB, which may explain such allergic reactions to MB-FFP. SD-FFP was first introduced in 1991 in the german Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. it was often permitted during the registration process on the basis of its obvious viral safety, although no efficacy against non-enveloped viruses had been found. now ordinary medicinal licensing is required for SD-FFP in European countries except for France307, where it is a labelled blood product. allergic reactions in patients receiving blood products have become a special focus of interest in the french haemovigilance programme. it should be specified that this focus has emerged from sentence n. 357463 of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, between MacoPharma and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9308. Directive 62/2005/CE262 was adopted by the italian Legislative Decree n. 208 of 9th November 2007261. the quality and safety of technologies are regulated by articles 20 and 25 of the Italian Legislative Decree 261/2007259 and, at the European level, by Directive 2002/98/CE254. Clause 6 regulates hospital blood banks, while clause 8 defines the inspection and control measures. each member state must ensure that the competent authority organises inspections and appropriate control measures in blood establishments. aims of EUDAMED are to strengthen market surveillance and transparency in the field of medical devices. the principle of informed consent consists in the right of patients to obtain all necessary information in order to make a well-informed and responsible decision. the information must be appropriate with respect to the goals, the nature of the intervention and the potential consequences and risks for the patient. in italy, informed consent to blood transfusion is required by the ministerial Decree of 3rd March 2005. the practice of obtaining a valid consent for blood transfusion is still highly heterogeneous across the country. patients should be informed of potential damages due to the PRT. all haemovigilance data are collected on SISTRA and are available on the websites of both the national health service and the national blood centre. Directive 2002/98/EC states that \"member States must ensure that blood establishments implement a system for identifying each single blood donation and each single blood unit and components thereof\" the right to have access to full information and to safeguard one\u2019s privacy imposes on authorities the duty to guarantee proper, safe access to personal data. a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of an official authority. a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept under the control of an official authority. the processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject or are necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. european dispositions do not establish time limits for the provision of informed consent. effective informed consent implies allowing the patient the time necessary to consider alternatives. there are situations in which a patient\u2019s health state requires immediate action. justice and equity is one of the main principles for the provision of health care in systems based on solidarity. limited health care resources do, therefore, compel cost-effectiveness considerations and prioritisation of health care measures. the use of technologies may influence the fairness of healthcare systems, or require special considerations. directive 2002/98/EC outlines specific requirements for the processing of blood supplies. directive sets out standards for blood establishments in reference to responsibilities, quality management, documentation, record keeping, traceability, adverse events, storage and transport. directive 2001/83/EC253 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6th November 2001 set out technical requirements for blood and blood products in all Member States. Articles 11\u201313 define a quality system for blood establishments and the requirement to keep a record of the previous year\u2019s activity. in accordance with Annex II of Directive 2002/98/CE254, 22 Member States receive annual reports from blood establishments on the previous year\u2019s activities. EUDAMED contains registration data of manufacturers, authorised representatives and devices. data relating to certificates issued, modified, supplemented, suspended, withdrawn or refused. SISTRA enhances the flow of information between the Italian Ministry of Health, the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano and the National Blood Centre. the information must be appropriate with respect to the goals, the nature of the intervention and the potential consequences and risks for the patient. clause 13 and 14 regulate the information to be provided to patients, as well as their informed consent. the declaration of Helsinki is another important document concerning informed consent317. the practice of obtaining a valid consent for blood transfusion is still highly heterogeneous across the country. patients should be informed of potential damages due to the PRT. patients should be informed of residual risks concerning pathogens for which no detection method exists. the right to have access to full information and to safeguard one\u2019s privacy imposes on authorities the duty to guarantee proper, safe access to personal data, as affirmed in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council313. paragraph 1 shall not apply where processing of the data is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, provision of care or treatment. a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of an official authority. a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept under the control of an official authority. derogations from paragraph 1 provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be notified to the Commission. european dispositions do not establish time limits for the provision of informed consent. effective informed consent implies allowing the patient the time necessary to consider alternatives. there are situations in which a patient\u2019s health state requires immediate action. the most relevant documents include the 2011/24/UE Directive of the European Parliament and the Council, concerning the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare. it is also worth recalling the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union issued on 28th April 1998 (C-120/95)324. application of guidelines/criteria for appropriate management and clinical utilisation of blood resources is of paramount importance as it represents a fundamental \u201cparallel tool\u201d for blood and blood product self-sufficiency. but there is still a relevant lack of homogeneous guidelines in Italy. the social analysis addresses aspects that are also important for all the other domains of the HTA328. there are several theoretical frameworks for carrying out a social analysis. the social analysis was carried out by the EUnetHTA model. the main sources of information for the social analysis were literature identified in international databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CRD) a three-step literature search was applied: (i) all participants in the HTA project were asked to notify the social analysis group if they found specific contributions discussing social issues. no contributions were notified; (ii) a search was made for HTA reports on the topic in online databases. socially relevant issues identified were summarised and then organised into two main paragraphs according to the EUnetHTA social domain table of issues. social areas concerning the patient (family life, hospital/home care, work, leisure time, lifestyle, cultural activities) are directly influenced to variable extents, by the technologies in question, because the availability of plasma that is as safe as possible implies a longer and better quality life for the patient. patients may react to a technology in a positive or negative way, for example with preferences/perceptions (such as a critical attitude towards \u201cscientific\u201d medicine in favour of \u201calternative\u201d medicine) and existential experiences/feelings (e.g.: the person\u2019s values as a human being, or depending on his/her social status) current use of technology, safety and ethical domains are needed. continuous updated cost-effectiveness analyses on the technology in question are needed to understand financial outlay required from the national health service. the available cost-effectiveness analyses seem to suggest that the best option for plasma pathogen inactivation is the SD method. inactivation in plasma and PRT-treated plasma has been in clinical use for several years. the evidence-based indications for the use of plasma and PRT-treated plasma are few and specific. the evidence-based indications for the use of plasma and PRT-treated plasma are few and specific. a single-centre retrospective haemovigilance investigation in france did not confirm this finding. two other technologies, based on a photochemical process involving a psoralen or riboflavin, both plus light treatment, have been developed more recently. there are few studies available on these technologies and the level of evidence they provide is low or moderate. the results of the literature search did not enable a direct comparison between the different pathogen-reduction methods. a good cost-effectiveness profile was observed only in certain subgroups of patients. a good cost-effectiveness profile was observed only in certain subgroups of patients. different outcome measures should be considered to improve effectiveness estimates. value-specific thresholds for interventions to improve blood safety should be defined also for clinical outcome measures. analysis of organisational aspects of PRT was carried out by dividing infectious risk prevention procedures into three groups. quality control and validation of SD-FFP are guided by the guidelines of the European Council and the EMA. the risk-benefit ratio of using these PRT seems to be favourable. it is still uncertain whether the use of SD-FFP, MB-FFP, A-FFP and R-FFP fulfil the criteria of just resource allocation. the social domain, just as the ethical analysis, can support the HTA process as a whole (e.g., by prioritising topics/issues, defining/framing research questions) social analysis addresses aspects that are also important for all other domains of the HTA328. the social domain assessment was carried out by a team of four ethicists. the main sources of information for the social analysis were literature identified in international databases. the PubMed query was based on the following scheme: SOCIAL ASPECTS (\u201cfamily\u201d OR \u201ccaregiver\u201d OR \u201cdaily life\u201d OR \u201ccommunication\u201d OR \u201cinformed consent\u201d OR \u201creturn to work\u201d OR \u201cperceptions\u201d OR \u201cpreference\u201d OR \u201cexpectation\u201d OR \u201cquality of life\u201d\u201d). Twenty-six contributions of possible interest for the social domain were identified. twenty-six contributions of possible interest for the social domain were identified. none of the 916 papers contained a specific section on the social domain. none explicitly addressed the social issues related to PRT for plasma. safe plasma is relevant to health professionals involved in different levels of the health care service in which daily clinical routine requires the use of blood components. human, technical, economic, cultural, physical, emotional, personal, social, juridical, and organisational support and resources are needed, in general. social knowledge and understanding of PRT-FFP are crucial both for an adequate perception of the technology in question and for the socially accepted cost-effectiveness ratio. traditional media (radio, television, newspapers, magazines) and web-based media (social networks, blogs, institutional/patients\u2019/citizens\u2019 websites) offer a large amount of information, which is not synonymous with providing full, real knowledge, understanding and awareness of all the aspects of PRT-FFP. social information campaigns should be aimed at avoiding public mistrust towards the technology or towards medicine in general. patients should be involved and empowered in decision-making processes, also through citizens/patients\u2019 associations (cf. also organisational and ethical domains) the eu directive 2002/98/EC states the need to set up organised surveillance procedures to collect/evaluate information on adverse/unexpected events/reactions resulting from the collection and transfusion of blood or blood components. it is socially relevant to address the matter of which economic/financial resources the patient can (or cannot) count on to activate the use of the technology. inactivation technologies, but also the fact that the risk of transmission of pathogens is very low but not absent. continuous updated cost-effectiveness analyses on the technology in question are needed to understand the financial outlay required from the national health service. at present, the available cost-effectiveness analyses seem to suggest that the best option for plasma pathogen inactivation is the SD method. the study did not reveal a dominant strategy for pathogen inactivation of FFP. the vast majority of the studies considered investigated safety, efficacy and economic aspects of SD-FFP, MB-FFP, R-FFP and A-FFP. however, comparative studies among the pathogen inactivation technologies were limited. SD-FFP has proven to be non-inferior to untreated FFP in management of a wide range of congenital and acquired bleeding disorders. the major advantages of SD plasma over FFP and other types of pathogen-inactivated plasma are its extreme safety with respect to TRALI and significantly lower likelihood of provoking allergic reactions. the number of cases of TRALI has been very low in recent years. the results of the literature search did not enable a direct comparison between the different pathogen-reduction methods. however, there are few studies that compare the various techniques with each other or with the conventional method. analysis of organisational aspects of PRT was carried out by dividing infectious risk prevention procedures into three groups. most of the information was retrieved from documents released by monitoring authorities, grey literature, manufacturers\u2019 handbooks and experts\u2019 opinions, which creates a bias due to insufficient or selective inclusion of information and data. a single infected bag, while plasma prepared with the industrial method requires EMA plasma Master File certification. this guarantees full traceability of the plasma, simplification and standardisation of the transfusion chain and the quality of information at the european level. ethical domain Important points to consider during decision-making about SD-FFP, MB-FFP, A-FFP and R-FFP are that the risk-benefit ratio of using these PRT seems to be favourable."}
