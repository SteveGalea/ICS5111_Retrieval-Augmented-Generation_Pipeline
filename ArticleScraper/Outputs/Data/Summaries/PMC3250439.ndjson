{"summary": "mouse model of ARDS induced by 2009 H1N1 virus has been widely reported. no animal model has been developed for ARDS caused by 2009 H1N1 virus. mice were inoculated with A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09) ARDS caused by 2009 H1N1 virus results in 17.3\u201356% mortality [4], [6], [7], [8], which was regarded as the major cause of death by 2009 H1N1 virus infection [9]. ARDS is the result of acute injury to lung tissue, commonly resulting from sepsis, trauma, and severe pulmonary infections. a virulent variant 2009 H1N1 virus was isolated from a pig and possessed a virulence-associated HA-D222G mutation. the model established here provides a useful tool to explore the mechanism of ARDS, as well as screening and therapeutic options. the virus titers in the lung gradually increased between days 2 and 6 p.i. only one of three mice possessed detectable virus in the lungs on day 10 p.i. no viruses were detected in other organs. the results indicated that the SD/09 virus could induce acute lung edema in mice. on day 4 p.i., lung lesions were characterized by dropout of mucous epithelium and inflammatory cells adhering to the bronchiolar surface. interstitial pneumonia was also observed that showed interstitial edema. on day 8 p.i., the virus caused more severe interstitial pneumonia (G, H, ), bronchiolitis (G, H, solid arrows) and peribronchiolitis (G, H, open arrows) on day 8 p.i., the interstitial tissue was thickened with fibrin exudation and organization (I, ). immunohistochemistry revealed viral antigens in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, and alveolar epithelial cells. SD/09 virus could infect the epithelia of the lower airway and cause viral pneumonia in mice. most infected mice showed severe clinical signs of respiratory distress on day 8 p.i. the number of leukocytes in the BALF from virus-infected mice showed an increase from day 4 p.i. the number of leukocytes from SD/09-infected mice showed an increase from day 4 p.i. compared with the control group on day 8 p.i. control 1.490.29 90.652.71 6.972.25 0.690.35 8 H1N1 9.162.21** 26.632.19** 40.43.22** 28.931.98*** Control 1.850.59 88.664.34 7.651.20 1.580.48 10 H1N1 8.592.81** 33.232.70** 42.254.42** 21.627.90*** Control 1.690.48 89.324.8 6.931.2 0.990. p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, comparison between virus-infected and control groups. all five were significantly different between virus-infected and control mice. interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 reached peak levels as early as day 2 p.i. by day 2 p.i., most mice showed more severe clinical signs of respiratory disease. most mice were nearly unable to respond to exterior stimuli. Approximately 60% of mice died between days 8 and 10 p.i. mice were inoculated with 102.5 pfu SD/09 viruses. tissues were collected at indicated times p.i. and viruses were titrated in MDCK cells. body weight, lung wet and dry weight were determined and recorded. lesions in the lungs of infected mice were still severe on day 14 p.i., with extensive alveolar collapse. remaining alveoli were filled with fibrin, desquamated alveolar cells, and inflammatory cells. lungs from mock-infected mice had no apparent histological changes. immunohistochemistry revealed viral antigens in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles (Figure 3D), terminal bronchioles, and alveolar epithelial cells. most infected mice showed a slightly decreased partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), saturation of arterial oxygen (SaO2), and slightly increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). these results suggested acute respiratory dysfunction and severe hypoxemia in virus-infected mice. the number of leukocytes in the BALF from SD/09-infected mice showed an increase from day 4 p.i. these data indicate a dramatic increase in inflammatory cells in the lungs of SD/09-infected mice. the peak was 18-fold greater than that of the control group on day 8 p.i. leukopenia was detected on day 4 p.i., and was statistically significant on day 6 p.i. (p0.05); the lowest value appeared on day 8 p.i. (p0.001). differential blood counts revealed that the number of lymphocytes sharply decreased in infected mice. infection with SD/09 viruses resulted in elevated amounts of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of mice. mice were euthanized at indicated times p.i. the collected lungs were weighed, and 10% homogenates were prepared in cold PBS. swine isolate, SD/09, had a D222G mutation in HA. compared with swine isolate, SD/09 showed significantly increased virulence in mice. pathological changes presented a progressive pattern. infected mice developed hypoxemia consistent with the appearance of clinical signs and lung lesions of ARDS. previous studies showed that mice infected with typical 2009 H1N1 virus only showed mild interstitial inflammatory infiltration and limited alveolitis [18], [21], whereas severe lung damage was found in the SD/09-infected mice. type II pneumocytes are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant to lower the surface tension of water and allow membrane separation. insufficient pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli may result in alveolar collapse [28], [29] alveolar macrophages may play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. viral cell tropism may determine the processes of ARDS. the hallmarks of disease severity were elevated levels of IL-6, IL-15, IL-8 and TNF- in infected mouse lungs. it has proved that high levels of IL-6 were able to mediate acute lung injury [37] and had a negative correlation with the PaO2FiO2 ratio in severely affected patients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection. the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09), was isolated from swine in china in December 2009. all the eight gene segments from the swine isolate have a close relationship to 2009 H1N1 influenza virus circulating in the human population. mock-infected mice were lightly anesthetized and inoculated i.n. with 50 l 102.5 pfu SD/09 virus in PBS. twenty mice (10 infected with SD/09 virus and 10 inoculated with PBS) were used to investigate clinical signs and mortality for 14 days. an anti-influenza nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody was used to identify influenza A virus nucleoprotein in sections. three mice were anesthetized with Zoletil (tiletamine-zolazepam; Virbac; 20 g/g) on days 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 p.i. the number of leukocytes in the BALF was counted with a hemacytometer. for differential counts, the samples from each mouse were stained with Wright stain. the numbers of monocytes, neutrophil and lymphocytes were determined, on the basis of morphologic criteria. data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) pairwise comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni post-hoc test. all data are reported as mean SD. 10 mice in each group were infected with 101.5, 102.5 or 103.5 pfu viruses. a dose of 102.5 pfu was optimal because the course of the disease was prolonged and the mice presented with obvious signs of respiratory illness. three mice were euthanized on days 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 p.i. the lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the lungs were lavaged twice in situ with the chest cavity opened by midline incision with a total volume of 1.0 ml saline (4\u00b0C) inserted through an endotracheal tube. aliquot of BALF was diluted 11 with 0.01% crystal violet and 2.7% acetic acid for leukocyte staining and erythrocyte hemolysis. ifugation at 200 g at room temperature for 5 min. supernatants were discarded and 300 l wash buffer was added. data were analyzed using BD CBA Software."}
