{"summary": "the primary roles of this class of proteolytic enzymes have long been assumed to be in late-stage processing of intracellular proteins through protein degradation pathways. however, new functions for aminopeptidases have been identified. these include roles as an antivirulence factor in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (33), a virus receptor (42), and a regulator of cellular stress response (8). three-liter cultures of V. fischeri strain ES114 were grown overnight in LBS medium (16) at 24\u00b0C with shaking to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. the aminopeptidase activity was eluted with 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) aminopeptidase activity was visualized by soaking the gel in buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing 10 M L-Leu-AMC, followed by illumination with 340-nm UV light. a single fluorescent blue band appeared after about 5 min. a single fluorescent blue band appeared after about 5 min. 1% (wt/vol) porcine mucin was incubated at 28\u00b0C for 48 to 72 h. colonies were stained with 0.1% (wt/vol) amido black in 3.5 M acetic acid. a zone of clearing surrounding the resultant colonies indicated casein hydrolysis. pepN was transferred to pET26b(+) vector and subcloned in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. cultures containing the pET26b(+)PepN recombinant plasmid were grown at 30\u00b0C in LB containing kanamycin (50 g/ml) and glucose (0.5%) to an OD600 of 0.6. mM Tris-Cl with 0.5 M NaCl and fractions containing the aminopeptidase were pooled and applied to a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B column. the purified aminopeptidase was collected and concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell ultrafiltration device fitted with an YM30 membrane. a sample of protease was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column. reactions of aminopeptidase with AMC substrates were observed at 440 nm. fluorescence intensity was converted to concentration changes using a standard curve developed from free 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin. transconjugates that underwent homologous recombination were selected on LBS supplemented with erythromycin at 5 g/ml (final concentration) the insertion was confirmed genetically by PCR and phenotypically by the fluorescent aminopeptidase assay described previously. the complete pepN gene, including promoter and terminator, was amplified using primers PepN orf R (5\u2032 CCCCATATGGCTGCACCAGAATAATGGCT heroplasts were resuspended in sterile seawater and disrupted by sonication. the total membrane fraction was then collected by centrifugation for 1 h at 13,000 g. the supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction (18) squid light organs were homogenized and then homogenates were serially diluted and plated on SWT to determine symbiont concentration per squid. 200 isolated colonies from squid colonized with the pepN mutant were patched onto SWT and SWT supplemented with 5 g/ml erythromycin (SWT erm5). fluorescently labeled light organs (red) and GFP-producing bacteria (green) were visualized using a confocal microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) identification of aminopeptidase activity. three-liter cultures of V. fischeri strain ES114 were grown overnight in LBS medium (16) at 24\u00b0C. oresces at 440 nm upon cleavage of the peptide bond were pooled and applied to a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B column. fractions containing the activity of interest were concentrated using Amicon YM30 Centricon concentrators. the partially purified proteins were then separated on a Tris-glycine gel under nondenaturing conditions. a 5-l loopful of mid-log-phase cells was streaked onto a basal medium. cells were subsequently stained with 0.1% (wt/vol) amido black in 3.5 M acetic acid. a zone of clearing surrounding colonies indicated casein hydrolysis. the PCR product was gel purified and cloned using the procedure described in the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit. pepN was transferred to pET26b(+) vector and subcloned in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. the aminopeptidase enzyme was eluted with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. the protein of interest was eluted with 20 mM Tris-Cl with 0.5 M NaCl. fractions containing the aminopeptidase were pooled and applied to a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B column. aminopeptidase concentration in the cuvette was held constant at 1.1 nM. excitation wavelength was set at 365 nm, and emission was monitored at 440 nm. reactions of protease with PNA substrates were monitored at 440 nm. the fragment was cloned into pCR-BluntII TOPO and subcloned into pEVS122 (a suicidal vector in V. fischeri) the suicide vector was conjugated into V. fischeri using pEVS104 as the helper plasmid. the insertion was confirmed genetically by PCR and phenotypically by the fluorescent aminopeptidase assay described previously. each strain grown in HMM with shaking at 24\u00b0C was pelleted in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in a sucrose-salt solution. an aliquot of the spheroplasts, when diluted in deionized water, lost turbidity almost immediately. the total membrane fraction was then collected by centrifugation for 1 h at 13,000 g. ymbiont-free seawater (SFS) or seawater containing roughly equal concentrations (between 1,000 and 4,800 cells/ml) of either wild-type V. fischeri (strain ES114), the pepN mutant, or the complemented pepN mutant grown in SWT (12) after 3 h of exposure to the bacteria, squid were rinsed in SFS and then placed into separate vials of SFS. newly hatched squid were placed in scintillation vials containing 3 ml of filter-sterilized instant ocean (FSIO) and exposed to 106 cells per ml WT V. fischeri GFP+ or the pepN GFP+ mutant in FSIO with 20 g/ml chloramphenicol for 3 h. they were then anesthetized in 2% ethanol in FSIO, the mantles and funnel the cell-free supernatant contained less than 10% of the aminopeptidase activity of whole cells. the cell-associated aminopeptidase activity was completely inhibited by the addition of 500 M zincov, a zinc metalloprotease inhibitor. gene annotated VF_1282, aminopeptidase N, or PepN. translated protein is 867 amino acids long and lacks a Sec or TAT signal peptide. pepN gene is immediately upstream of VF_1284 and VF_1285. pepN hydrolyzes a variety of para-nitroanilide and 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) amino acid substrates. the aminopeptidase has broad activity, with a preference for basic and hydrophobic side chains (Arg > Lys > Phe > Met > Leu > Val) pepN encodes the major aminopeptidase activity. inactivation of pepN did not result in any decrease in mucinolytic or caseinolytic activity displayed by strain ES114. whole mutant cells produced less than 10% of the aminopeptidase activity of the wild-type strain. the periplasmic fraction contained low levels of both aminopeptidase (0.3%) and luciferase (0.04%) activity. expression of pepN from its native promoter on pVSV105 completely restored aminopeptidase activity to the mutant cells. this is likely due to multiple copies of pVSV105 being maintained in these cells (11) initiation defects are typically exacerbated during head-to-head competition with the wild type. at 12 h after initial infection, the wild type significantly outcompeted the mutant in roughly 75% of the squid. however, after 24 h, the competitive edge for the wild type was no longer apparent. colonization efficiency by the pepN mutant suggests impairment at the earliest stage of colonization, initiation, which includes aggregation, migration to the pores, and early growth in the light organ prior to the first venting (32). the first of these events, aggregation, was observed by incubating newly hatched squid with 106 GFP-labeled wild-type (A) or pepN mutant (B) V. fischeri. the cell-free supernatant contained less than 10% of the aminopeptidase activity of whole cells. the activity was completely inhibited by the addition of 500 M zincov, a zinc metalloprotease inhibitor. gene annotated VF_1282, aminopeptidase N, or PepN (>99% identity over 17% of the complete PepN protein) translated protein is 867 amino acids long and lacks a Sec or TAT signal peptide (3, 34). pepN gene is immediately upstream of VF_1284 (NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase) recombinant PepN is a monomeric protein of approximately 96,200 Da. it is a molecular mass of 97,904 Da calculated from mass spectral data. pepN hydrolyzes a variety of para-nitroanilide and 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) amino acids. kcat/Km (s1 M1) Leu-AMC 17 106 3 106 5.7 0.8 3.4 105 Phe-AMC 60 106 13 106 6.5 1.6 1.1 105 Met-AMC 25 106 2 106 11 1.5 4.4

these cells (11) initiation defects are typically exacerbated during head-to-head competition with the wild type. however, after 24 h, the competitive edge for the wild type was no longer apparent. the wild type significantly outcompeted the mutant in roughly 75% of the squid. newly hatched squid were incubated with 106 wild-type wild-type (A) or pepN mutant (B) V. fischeri or pepN mutant bacteria. the pepN mutant produced aggregates, but they were consistently smaller in size than those of the wild-type strain. squid light organ is rich in host-derived mucus, amino acids, and peptides capable of nourishing populations of up to 1011 cells per ml in adult squid (17, 31, 32) a pepN-type enzyme is responsible for the majority of the aminopeptidase activity detectable by cleavage of L-Leu-AMC substrate. kcat values for all substrates are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those of E. coli PepN. pepN enzymes do not possess an N-terminal signal sequence and are generally accepted to be cytosolic (14, 15) the vast majority of PepN activity was associated with the cytoplasm, with much of the remaining activity found in the cell membrane fraction (Table 2). however, some of the membrane-associated aminopeptidase reported in this study might be due to cross-contamination with cytoplasmic contents. the membrane fraction also contained a small amount of cytoplasmic luciferase activity. the mutant was outcompeted by the wild type in the first 12 h after initial infection. however, the competition defect was no longer apparent after 24 h. this could not explain the early colonization defect by the mutant in single-strain inoculations. squid mucus and the light organ interior are protected from nonspecific colonization by a variety of host defenses, including nitric oxide (NO). squid mucus and the light organ interior are protected from nonspecific colonization by a variety of host defenses, including nitric oxide (NO). pepN was detected by liquid chromatography/MS in the light organ of adult squid (37) the bacteria are expressing the enzyme in squid well beyond 24 h, but its role is unclear."}
