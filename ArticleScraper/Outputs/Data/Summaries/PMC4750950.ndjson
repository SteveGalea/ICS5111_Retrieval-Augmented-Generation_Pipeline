{"summary": "infections with respiratory viruses are a common cause of usually mild respiratory illness in all age groups. in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, respiratory viruses cause higher rates of lower respiratory tract disease and are associated with a higher mortality rate [5\u20139] in immunocompromised patients respiratory viruses tend to persist longer due to a constrained immune response and therefore spread more easily into the lower respiratory tract. there is only limited information regarding the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adults combined with the prevalence, duration and clinical impact of viral shedding. only patients with very severe or not otherwise explicable symptoms are tested due to the lower prevalence of respiratory virus infections in that season. standard screening was escalated in February 2013 and all patients were screened for infection with influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and RSV on admission to one of the wards regardless of respiratory symptoms. additional screening for other community acquired viruses such as rhino-, adeno- or coronavirus was not performed. nasopharyngeal swabs of all inpatients and outpatients screened for the respiratory viruses influenza, parainfluenza and RSV during the winter season 2012/2013 were retrospectively analysed. readily available medical records were retrospectively reviewed from all patients to obtain basic characteristics, clinical and laboratory data. za virus 3, primers PIV3-4885s (5\u2019- AAAGAGGTCAACACCAACAACT-3\u2019) and PIV3-5285a (5\u2019- TGTATTGCTTTTGGTC-3\u2019) were used. a phylogenetic tree was constructed in MEGA using the maximum-likelihood method and the Tamura-Nei algorithm. a given infection was calculated from the first positive to the final positive sample. a previously infected patient was considered to have cleared the infection when he/she was asymptomatic. a previously infected patient had two nasopharyngeal samples taken a week apart that tested negative Statistical analysis. all patients with proven viral infection were retested until clearance of virus. infected patients were isolated in single rooms or isolated in cohorts. analysis was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) verse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) RNA was extracted from respiratory specimens using the QIAamp\u00ae viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the real-time RT-PCR kits distinguished influenza A, B, H1N1, RSV A, and RSV B. the realStar RT-PCR kit cannot differentiate between parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 and between types 2 and 4. multiple alignments from influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and RSV nucleotide sequences were carried out with the MEGA software version 5.05. a phylogenetic tree was constructed in MEGA using the maximum-likelihood method and the Tamura-Nei algorithm for influenza virus phylogenetic analysis. a few sporadic cases of patients with respiratory virus infection were detected by PCR. the total number of patients admitted for any reason to one of the four hematologic wards was 421 (148 female, 273 male) from November 2012 to January 2013, and 341 (123 female, 218 male) from February to April 2013. infection control measures were intensified to isolation of all newly admitted patients as well as all patients who developed respiratory symptoms until a negative swab was obtained. the number of visitors allowed was reduced to two visitors per person and children under the age of twelve were no longer admitted to the wards. however, visitors with respiratory symptoms were not admissible to the wards. five of the fatal cases were infected with influenza virus, one with parainfluenza virus and seven with RSV. no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between influenza, parainfluenza and RSV infected patients. risk factor assessment amongst all infected patients showed by univariate analysis for the endpoint LRTI uncontrolled hematological disease (OR 4.39 [95% CI 1.70;11.84], p = 0.001), presence of co-infections (OR 5.82 [95% CI 2.07;17.82, p = 0.0002) as significant risk factors; a trend was seen for severe leukopenia (i.e. leukocytes 1/nl group 1 represents the reference strain A/California/7/2009. the here identified A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to the subgroups 6A (n = 1), 6C (n = 2), and group 7 (n = 2). the here detected A(H3N2) viruses belonged to group 5 (n = 1), subgroup 3C.2 (n = 2) and 3C.3 (n = 4) patient numbers are indicated, reference sequences for infuenza virus selected from GISAID are indicated by their accession numbers. also, HA sequences from german national influenza sentinel are presented. two clusters identified within genotype ON1 subgroup, cluster 1 with 15 patients harboring identical RSV A ON1 strain G gene sequence. cluster 2 comprising 12 patients with another set of identical G gene sequence. 27 (50%) of 54 infected patients carried similar virus strains. long-term virus detectionfor more than 30 days was detected in 20 (29%) infected patients, i.e. two influenza virus infections, two parainfluenza virus infections, and 16 RSV infections. 5 out of 6 patients with extreme long-term virus detection for 90 days had received an allogeneic transplant; the one without allogeneic transplantation (P52) had experienced graft-failure with long-term leukopenia.

LRTI: lower respiratory tract infection; MM: multiple myeloma; MDS: myelodysplastic syndrome; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; NHL: non-Hodgkin lymphoma; NHL: non-Hodgkin lymphoma; NHL: non-Hodgkin lymphoma; NHL: non-Hodgkin lymphoma; LRTI: lower respiratory tract infection; MM: multiple myeloma in regard of the endpoint severe LRTI only presence of co-infections (OR 4.89 [95% CI 1.31;19.39], p = 0.008) was a significant risk factor. a trend was seen for uncontrolled hematological disease (OR 3.42 [95% CI 0.93;13.28], p = 0.06) by multivariate analysis no significant influence factors could be identified. these viruses belonged to group 5 (n = 1), subgroup 3C.2 (n = 2) and 3C.3 (n = 4) since the 2001/02 season, influenza B viruses of the Victoria- and Yamagata-lineage co-circulated with different seasonal prevalence. Phylogenetic tree of parainfluenza virus sequences from the fusion gene was constructed with MEGA version 5.05 using the maximum likelihood method. patient numbers are indicated, reference sequences for parainfluenza virus type 3 selected from GenBank are indicated by their accession numbers. atic/URTI only, 47% vs 33% non-severe LRTI, 12% vs 25% severe LRTI, and 12% vs 8% fatal outcome in cluster 1 and 2, respectively. all RSV-B strains clustered with strains previously assigned to the BA genotype with a 60 nucleotide duplication. autologous transplant but experienced graft-failure with long-term leukopenia. no significant difference in the rate of LRTI development between patients with and without long-term virus detection. allogeneic LRTI RSV A ON1 cluster 1 91 d yes P82 f 63 MM auto/allo LRTI RSV A ON1 cluster 1 38 d yes P88 m 62 AML allogeneic URTI parainfluenza 3 30 d yes P95 m 51 pancr. cancer allogeneic LRTI RSV A ON1 cluster 1 91 d yes P102 m 49 ALL allogeneic URTI R 12 (75%) of 16 long-term RSV shedding patients were infected with identical RSV G gene sequences found in phylogenetic genotype ON1 clusters 1 and 2. patient P48, diagnosed with multiple myeloma, had received autologous and allogeneic transplantation and was persistently infected for 334 days. a broader screening for respiratory pathogens in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients has been recommended by several experts. nine of the fatal cases underwent blood stem cell transplantation, three were autologous and six were allogeneic. the contribution of these agents to the fatal outcome is difficult to assess. a similar prevalence of co-circulating influenza virus types/subtypes during the season 2012/13 was reported by the national influenza surveillance system in Germany. the same variants were identified in our population-based surveillance and within our study cohort. no difference between variants causing mild and severe clinical cases could be detected. studies on RSV strains show an accumulation of amino acid changes over the years, suggesting antigenic drift-based immunity-mediated selection. the european pattern in seasonal activity of RSV usually alternates in a regular biennial rhythm; an early season with strong RSV activity is followed by a weaker late season. the novel genotype appears to be beneficial for the virus. it shows an improved ability to evade previously induced immunity in the population suggesting an immune-escape strategy. the presence of two distinct clusters points to nosocomial transmission. a median viral shedding duration as long as 12 weeks has been reported. this is the first time that for RSV a median shedding duration as long as 12 weeks has been reported. the development of a vaccine could prevent RSV-related pneumonia in adults. the study population is a heterogeneous group in regard to a variety of aspects. patients and samples were obtained based on a routine screening for respiratory viruses. a mixed cohort of in-patients and outpatients were included in this study. phylogenetic clusters of genotype RSV ON1 strains and identical HA sequences of influenza viruses identified in these patients might indicate nosocomial transmission. prolonged virus shedding was observed especially in patients with RSV infection and following allogeneic transplantation."}
