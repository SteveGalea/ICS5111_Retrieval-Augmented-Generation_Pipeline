{"summary": "the public health agency of Sweden identified the need to use a structured method that takes relevant aspects into account. some attempts have also been made to prioritize among pathogens causing communicable diseases. the method we identified to be most appropriate to our needs was one developed at the Robert Koch Institute in 2011 [8\u201310] the scores and motivations were anonymized and sent out in a second round so each participant could change their answers in light of the other experts\u2019 replies. the panel could reach a consensus without letting \u201cgroup dynamics\u201d affect the process. risk perception of this pathogen by the gernal public is moderate and informal political expectations/agenda is present This pathogen implies international duties or its risk perception by the general public is high or it is explicitly high on political agenda 9 Prevention possibilites and needs. the criterion \"Treatment possibilities and needs\" refers to availability and adequacy of treatment. internal and external experts were then asked to give a weight of 0 to 10 for each criterion. the score for each pathogen was multiplied by the weight and re-scaled from 0\u2013100. five experts were invited to participate in the scoring procedure. one expert from the national board of health and welfare, one from the public health agency of Sweden and three experts who were County Communicable Disease Control Officers. compared the outcome of the prioritization process in Sweden to the outcome in Germany. the national public health agency asked all epidemiologists to estimate how many full-time equivalents (1 year of full time work = 1 FTE) were spent on surveillance activities for each pathogen, as an average over a year. time spent on surveillance was not included in this estimation. Delphi process Five experts were invited to participate in the scoring procedure. one expert from the national board of health and welfare, one from the Public Health Agency of Sweden and three experts who were County Communicable Disease Control Officers. the national public health agency estimates how many full-time equivalents (1 year of full time work = 1 FTE) were spent on surveillance activities for each pathogen, as an average over a year. time spent on surveillance of typing results was not included in this estimation. mycobacterium (non-tuberculosis) (3) (M) Calicivirus (noro- and sapovirus) (2) (V) Bordetella pertussis (3) (M, TP) Adenovirus (2) BK-virus (5) Campylobacter spp (1) (M) Candida spp. (3) (M) Aspergillus spp. (3) (M) Candida spp. (3) (M) Aspergillus s enterococcus spp. (blood) incl. vancomycin resistant (VRE) (1) M, TP, TC) Coronaviruses (3) Helminths (flukes)** (4) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1) (M) Giardia lamblia (2) (M) Coxiella burnetii (3) (M) Hepatitis E virus (2) (M) Influenza virus (1) (M, V, TP) Haem Sindbisvirus (5) SARS- and MERS coronavirus (2) (M) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1) (M, TP) Hepatitis A virus (2) (M, TP) Parvovirus B19 (3) Staphylococcus aureus incl. methicillin resistent (MRSA) and Staphylococcus aureus, toxogenic (1) (M, TP, TC) Mycoplasma spp. (2) Hepatit cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, cyctis jiroveci, trichinella spp. was scored as a separate pathogen ****Helminths (tapeworms) group includes: Diphyllobotrium latum, Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis, Hymenolepsis nana, Taenia saginata, Taeniasolium. 106 pathogens were prioritized in Sweden but not in Germany. 31 pathogens were prioritized of the 63 pathogens under surveillance through notification of cases 19 (30%) were in the highest priority group, 19 (30%) in the high priority group, 17 (27%) in the medium priority group and 8 (13%) in the low priority group. two pathogens, (Borrelia and varicella-zoster virus) were in the highest priority group. in the low priority group there was only surveillance through typing for Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi. 21 pathogens were in the highest priority group, 28 in high priority group, 37 in the medium priority group and 20 in the low priority group. ESBL (1) (M, TP, TC) Citrobacter spp. incl. ESBL (3) (M, TC) Burkholderia cepacia (3) Clostridium perfringens (3) Echinococcus multilocularis (3) (M) Corynebacterium diphtheriae (2) (M) Chlamydia pneumoniae / Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3) Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis Hepatitis E virus (2) (M, V, TP) haemophilus influenzae (2) (M, TP, TC) Cytomegalovirus (HHV-5) (3) HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma associated) (3) Measels virus (1) (M, TP) Helicobacter pylori (1) Echinococcus granulosis (5) (M, TP) Klebsiella spp incl V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and V. cholerae (non O1 and O139) (3) (M) Tick borne encephalitis virus (2) (M) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2) (M) Vibrio cholerae (3) (M) Varicella zoster virus (1) Mumps virus (2) (M, TP) Humant T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) (3) ( Trichophyton spp, Microsporum spp and Epidermophyton spp. (dermatophytes) (5) Yersinia enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis (2) (M) **Helminths (flukes) group includes: Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis felineus, Opisthorchis viverrini, Fasciolopsis gigantica and Fasciolo 106 pathogens were prioritized compared to 127 in Germany. 12 pathogens were prioritized in Sweden but not in Germany. 31 pathogens were prioritized in Germany but not in germany. atypical mycobacteria, Chlamydiophila psittacci, Entamoeba histolytica, hepatitis E virus, JC-virus, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio non-cholerae. work-time for epidemiologist for surveillance corresponded to 7.0 FTE per year. we excluded the weighting step described in the original procedure. the reason for excluding the weighting step was that in the experience from Germany there was a high variation in the weight given by different groups of experts in Germany. True differences in incidence could explain why \u201cWork and school abseentism\u201d and \u201cHealth care utilization\u201d was scored lower in Sweden than in Germany for S. epidermidis. the incidence for Borrelia could also be higher in Sweden. for salmonella our method divided Salmonella spp and Salmonella Typhi and non-Typhi but the law requires surveillance for all forms of Salmonella. 95% of FTEs were spent on surveillance through notifications for pathogens in the highest and high priority group. surveillance through typing was to a large extent focused on the highest and high priority group. despite the modifications to the procedure, the Delphi process was very time consuming and took over a year to carry out. despite the associated costs, it could have led to \u201cexpert fatigue\u201d and a changing interpretation of the ranking criteria over time. the results indicate that other countries with a similar panorama of communicable diseases could consider using the list from either Sweden or Germany in order to save time. for countries who plan to conduct the prioritization method we recommend to consider additional modifications of the prioritization method."}
