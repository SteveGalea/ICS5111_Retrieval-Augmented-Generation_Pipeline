{"summary": "viral nucleic acids are the main pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by the innate immune system (1). double-stranded dsRNA (dsRNA) is sensed by receptors such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and different members of the RIG-I-like receptor family. 5\u2032ppp end are preferentially recognized by RIG-I, long dsRNA lacking the triphosphate moiety, such as poly(IC), are recognized by TLR3 and MDA5 (13). the selected aptamers contained poly(U) motifs that were crucial for RIG-I activation of the immune response but unexpectedly activated RIG-I in a 5\u2032-triphosphate-independent manner. treatment with agonists of TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 inhibited hepatitis B virus as well as herpes simplex virus-2 replication in a type I IFN-dependent manner (25\u201327). treatment with agonists of TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 inhibited hepatitis B virus as well as herpes simplex virus-2 replication in a type I IFN-dependent manner (25\u201327). dengue fever is already a leading infectious disease in tropical areas. chikungunya fever is a lesser-known disease also affecting the same subtropical regions of the world. chikungunya fever has reemerged with millions of estimated cases since 2005. RNA was prepared using the Ambion MEGAscript T7 kit. 5\u2032pppRNA was purified using the Qiagen miRNA minikit. a RNA with the same sequence but lacking the 5\u2032ppp moiety was purchased from IDT. MRC-5 cells were grown in Earle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids (PAA) and antibiotics. mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. confluent monolayers of C6/36 insect cells were infected with DENV NGC. after 7 days of infection, medium was harvested, cleared by centrifugation. after 2 washes, the virus was resuspended in DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. cell culture supernatants from 5\u2032ppp-treated were incubated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the sample in a total volume of 500 l of DMEM without serum. after 1 h of infection, the inoculum was removed and cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 2% agarose in complete DMEM. the percentage of cells infected with DENV was determined by standard intracellular staining (ICS) with a mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for DENV-E protein (clone 4G2) followed by staining with a secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) cell surface expression of phosphatidylserine was measured using an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) protein concentration was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic protein assay anti-ISG15 (Cell Signaling, MA, USA), anti-pSTAT1 (Cell Signaling, MA, USA), anti-STING (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-DENV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and anti--actin (Odyssey, USA) protein expression levels were determined and normalized to -actin using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) PCR primers were designed using Roche's Universal Probe Library assay design center. RT-qPCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 probes master (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) total RNA was isolated by lysis in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% (wt/vol) lithium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 g/ml proteinase K. RNA samples were separated in 1.5% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels using the CHIKV genomic and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) were visualized with probe CHIKV-hyb4 (5\u2032-TGTGGGTTCGGAGAATCGTGGA-3\u2032) negative-stranded RNA was detected with probe CHIKV-hyb2 (5\u2032-AACCCATCATCATCATGGATCCTGTGTACGTGGA-3\u2032) an RNA with the same sequence but lacking the 5\u2032ppp moiety was purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., IA, USA) this RNA generated results identical to those obtained with 5\u2032pppRNA that was dephosphorylated enzymatically with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. MRC-5 cells were grown in Earle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids (PAA) and antibiotics. mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. confluent monolayers of C6/36 insect cells were infected with DENV NGC. the virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 28\u00b0C in a minimal volume of serum-free DMEM. the monolayer was washed once with serum-free medium and covered with DMEM containing 2% FBS. cells in 6-well clusters were incubated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the sample in a total volume of 500 l of DMEM without serum. cells were fixed and stained, and plaques were counted 5 days postinfection. all procedures with live DENV were performed in a biosafety level 2+ facility at the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute\u2013Florida. cells were analyzed on an LSRII flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) cell surface expression of phosphatidylserine was measured using an allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V antibody. annexin V binding was achieved by incubating A549 cells in annexin V binding buffer (Becton, Dickinson, NJ, USA) EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. protein concentration was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic protein assay kit. protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 20% acrylamide mini-protean TGX precast gels. anti-DENV (Odyssey, USA) and anti-actin (Odyssey, USA) antibody signals were detected by immunofluorescence using the IRDye 800CW and IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies (Odyssey, USA) protein expression levels were determined and normalized to -actin using ImageJ software. all data are presented as a relative quantification with efficiency correction based on the relative expression of target gene versus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) the N-fold differential mRNA expression of genes in samples was expressed as 2CT. CHIKV RNA isolation, denaturing agarose electrophoresis, and in-gel hybridization were performed. total RNA was isolated by lysis in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% (wt/vol) lithium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 g/ml negative-stranded RNA was detected with probe CHIKV-hyb2 (5\u2032-AACCCATCATCATCATCATCATGGATCCTGTGTGGA-3\u2032). prehybridization (1 h) and hybridization (overnight) were done at 55\u00b0C in 5 SSPE (0.9 M NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) pretreatment of cells with 5\u2032pppRNA also led to an 8.5-fold decrease in DENV RNA synthesis. release of infectious DENV was completely suppressed by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment. treatment with 1 ng/ml of 5\u2032pppRNA almost completely suppressed DENV infection. antiviral potential of 5\u2032pppRNA against DENV infection in nonimmune cells. pretreatment with 5\u2032pppRNA inhibits DENV replication in vitro. percentage of deNV-infected cells was determined by intracellular staining. data are the means SEM from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. the percentage of A549 DENV-infected cells and cell viability were assessed by flow cytometry and determined at 24 h (black bars), 48 h (gray bars), and 72 h (white bars) after DENV challenge. cells were pretreated with 5\u2032pppRNA (1 ng/ml) for 24 h before DENV challenge. A549 cells were treated with 5\u2032pppRNA (1 ng/ml) 4 h (black bars) or 8 h (gray bars) after infection. the percentage of DENV-infected cells was determined by intracellular staining. data represent the means SEM from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment elicited a strong antiviral response in uninfected and deNV-infected A549 cells. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment elicited a strong antiviral response in uninfected and deNV-infected cells. alpha (TNF-) were drastically decreased in the absence of a functional RIG-I sensor. expression of these immune sensors was knocked down in A549 cells by siRNA. efficacy of poly(IC) in preventing DENV infection was reduced to a larger extent in the absence of TLR3/MDA5. TBK1-deficient MEFs were more susceptible to DENV infection than wild-type MEFs. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment efficiently generates a RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1-dependent antiviral response. expression of IFIT1, RIG-I, and -actin was evaluated by Western blotting. cells were then infected with DENV (MOI, 0.5), and at 24 h p.i. the percentage of infected cells was assessed by intracellular staining of DENV E protein. data are the means SEM of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFN-/R) and the type III IFN receptor (IL-28R plus IL-10R) was knocked down using siRNA in A549 cells. expression of both type I and III IFN receptor was efficiently reduced. knockdown of type I IFN signaling was highly efficient. STAT1 was depleted in a549 cells using siRNA (Fig. 4D, lanes 5 to 8) but not a low dose (0.1 to 1 ng/ml) of 5\u2032pppRNA. the increased expression of IFIT1 following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment was not impacted. IFNAR2, or IL-28R siRNA, and 48 h later mRNA levels of IFNAR1, IFNAR2 and IL-28R were evaluated by RT-qPCR. expression of IFIT1, RIG-I, and -actin was evaluated by Western blotting. cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 5\u2032pppRNA (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) and then infected with DENV (MOI, 0.1) the percentage of DENV-infected cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. data are the means SEM from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. MDDC treated with 5\u2032pppRNA at 4 h p.i. were assessed for markers of activation of the innate immune response. increased levels of phosphorylated IRF3 and STAT1 were observed. a 2- to 10-fold increase in the expression of ISGs RIG-I and IFIT1 following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment were observed. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment protects human myeloid cells from primary and ADE deNV infection. Negatively selected monocytes were challenged with DENV (MOI, 20) in the presence or absence of the enhancing antibody 4G2 (0.5 g/ml) for 4 h. they were subsequently transfected with 5\u2032pppRNA (100 ng/ml) using Lyovec. CHIKV replication was strongly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with 5\u2032pppRNA 1 h prior to infection. as little as 1 ng/ml completely blocked CHIKV EGFP reporter gene expression. 5\u2032pppRNA concentration required to completely block CHIKV replication was 10-fold lower than that required to inhibit DENV in A549 cells. transfection of 0.1 ng/ml 5\u2032pppRNA led to 4-fold reduction in nsP1 and E2 expression. higher doses of 5\u2032pppRNA reduced nsP1 and E2 expression over 30-fold. effect of 5\u2032pppRNA treatment on production of infectious progeny was determined. MRC-5 cell viability measured 24 h posttransfection of 5\u2032pppRNA or control RNA lacking the 5\u2032 triphosphate. CHIKV E2, E3E2 and nsP1 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting of lysates of MRC-5 cells treated with 5\u2032pppRNA. several key proteins of the IFN signaling pathway (RIG-I, STAT1 and STING) were depleted in MRC-5 cells using siRNAs. Knockdown levels were assessed by Western blotting. /ml 5\u2032pppRNA and 24 h later the IFN signaling response was analyzed by monitoring the upregulation of IFITI or STAT1. postinfection treatment with 5\u2032pppRNA inhibits CHIKV replication and stimulates the RIG-I pathway in both uninfected and CHIKV-infected cells. CHIKV titers in the medium of untreated infected cells were 6 106 PFU/ml at 24 h p.i., while treatment from 1 h p.i. onward led to a more than 2-log reduction in infectious progeny. titers of 2 105, 7 105, and 1 106, respectively, were measured at 24 h p.i. expression levels of STAT1, RIG-I, and IFIT1 were analyzed by immunoblotting. CHIKV infection alone did not lead to increased STAT1, RIG-I, and IFIT1 expression. 5\u2032pppRNA inhibits DENV infection. antiviral effect was strictly dependent on the 5\u2032ppp moiety. pretreatment of cells with 5\u2032pppRNA also led to an 8.5-fold decrease in DENV RNA synthesis. release of infectious DENV was completely suppressed by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment. the viability of uninfected cells and cells protected from DENV infection by 5\u2032pppRNA was indistinguishable. the results demonstrate the antiviral potential of 5\u2032pppRNA against DENV infection in nonimmune cells. cells were determined by FACS 24 h after infection. data are the means SEM from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. cells were pretreated with 5\u2032pppRNA for 24 h before DENV challenge. A549 cells treated with 5\u2032pppRNA (1 ng/ml) 4 h (black bars) or 8 h (gray bars) after infection. percentage of DENV-infected cells was determined by intracellular staining. data represent the means SEM from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment elicited a strong antiviral response in uninfected and deNV-infected A549 cells. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment elicited a strong antiviral response in uninfected and deNV-infected cells. induction of type I and type III IFNs, as well as the inflammatory response, were all dependent on intact RIG-I signaling. IL-29 and tumor necrosis factor alpha significantly decreased in absence of a functional RIG-I sensor. expression of these immune sensors was knocked down in A549 cells by siRNA. efficacy of poly(IC) in preventing DENV infection was reduced to a larger extent in the absence of TLR3/MDA5 than in the absence of RIG-I. TBK1-deficient MEFs were more susceptible to DENV infection than wild-type MEFs. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment efficiently generates a RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1-dependent antiviral response that limits DENV infection in vitro. DA5 (white bars) siRNA (30 pmol each), and 48 h later they were treated with 5\u2032pppRNA (10 ng/ml) or poly(IC) (1 ng/ml) cells were then infected with DENV (MOI, 0.5), and at 24 h p.i. the percentage of infected cells was assessed by intracellular staining of DENV E protein using flow cytometry. expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFN-/R) and the type III IFN receptor (IL-28R plus IL-10R) was knocked down using siRNA in A549 cells. knockdown of type I IFN signaling was highly efficient. 49 cells stimulated with a higher (10 ng/ml) but not a low dose (0.1 to 1 ng/ml) of 5\u2032pppRNA. STAT1-independent induction of the antiviral response was sufficient to block DENV infection in A549 cells stimulated with a high 5\u2032pppRNA concentration. only IRF1 knockdown resulted in inhibition of the protective antiviral response generated by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment. mRNA levels of IFNAR1, IFNAR2 and IL-28R were evaluated by RT-qPCR. expression of IFIT1, RIG-I, and -actin was evaluated by Western blotting. cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 5\u2032pppRNA (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) and then infected with DENV (MOI, 0.1) the percentage of DENV-infected cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. MDDC treated with 5\u2032pppRNA at 4 h p.i. were assessed for markers of activation of the innate immune response. increased levels of phosphorylated IRF3 and STAT1 were observed. a 2- to 10-fold increase in the expression of ISGs RIG-I and IFIT1 following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment were observed. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment protects human myeloid cells from primary and ADE deNV infection. Negatively selected monocytes were challenged with DENV (MOI, 20) in the presence or absence of the enhancing antibody 4G2 (0.5 g/ml) for 4 h. they were subsequently transfected with 5\u2032pppRNA (100 ng/ml) using Lyovec. CHIKV replication was strongly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. as little as 1 ng/ml completely blocked CHIKV EGFP reporter gene expression. 5\u2032pppRNA concentration required to completely block CHIKV replication in MRC-5 cells was 10-fold lower than that required to inhibit DENV in A549 cells. ural proteins (translated from genomic RNA) and structural proteins (translated from the sgRNA) cells were pretreated with 5\u2032pppRNA or control RNA. transfection of 0.1 ng/ml 5\u2032pppRNA led to a 4-fold reduction in nsP1 and E2 expression. higher doses of 5\u2032pppRNA reduced nsP1 and E2 expression over 30-fold. MRC-5 cell viability measured 24 h posttransfection of 5\u2032pppRNA or control RNA lacking the 5\u2032 triphosphate. data represent means SEM from a representative experiment performed in quadruplicate. expression levels of RIG-I, STAT1, and IFIT1 were monitored by Western blotting. CHIKV replication in cells depleted for RIG-I, STAT1, or STING was similar or slightly increased compared to those transfected with a scrambled control siRNA. RNA-treated cells were transfected with 1 ng/ml 5\u2032pppRNA. a strong reduction of 5\u2032pppRNA-induced IFITI upregulation resulted in a strong reduction of 5\u2032pppRNA-induced upregulation of IFITI. the 5\u2032pppRNA-induced upregulation of IFITI was not affected by STAT1 depletion. CHIKV titers in the medium of untreated infected cells were 6 106 PFU/ml at 24 h p.i. treatment from 1 h p.i. onward led to a more than 2-log reduction in infectious progeny, i.e., 5 104 PFU/ml. postinfection treatment with 5\u2032pppRNA inhibits CHIKV replication in an addition-dependent manner. at 24 h p.i., cell lysates were prepared and STAT1, RIG-I, and IFIT-I protein levels were determined by Western blotting. expression levels of STAT1, RIG-I, and IFIT1 were analyzed by immunoblotting. CHIKV infection alone did not lead to increased STAT1, RIG-I, and IFIT1 expression. a 5\u2032pppRNA derived from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of VSV blocked the replication of multiple viruses both in vitro and in vivo (35). the antiviral effect was observed when 5\u2032pppRNA was administered both pre- and postinfection, with demonstrated inhibition of DENV and CHIKV protein expression, RNA levels, and production of infectious progeny. infection of mice lacking IFNAR led to a significantly higher lethality after DENV (51) or CHIKV infection (52, 53) RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3 are activated upon DENV infection. CHIKV-induced IFN- expression was more strongly reduced in RIG-I-deficient MEFs than in those lacking MDA5 (53) poly(IC)-mediated DENV antiviral response was dependent primarily on IFN- induction and was reversed by IKK inhibitors. poly(IC) prevented DENV infection in vitro but also decreased DENV viremia in vivo through increased inflammatory and humoral responses. new studies have shown that type I and III IFNs activate similar components of the JAK-STAT pathways. but type III IFNs induced a delayed and stronger induction of ISGs than type I IFNs (67). we did not find a significant antiviral role for type III IFN in deNV-infected A549 cells."}
