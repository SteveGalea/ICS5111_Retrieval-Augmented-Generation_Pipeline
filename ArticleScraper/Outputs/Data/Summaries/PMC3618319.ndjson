{"summary": "leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier. the chemokine CCL5/RANTES is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and mainly CCR5. wild type and mice lacking CCR5 were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 PFU of neurotropic HSV-1. current guidelines for the treatment of HSV-1 recommend intravenous acyclovir. however, there is some evidence that modulation of inflammatory response may be beneficial. the severity of the disease depends at least in part on the inflammatory response. receptors CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 are known to be promiscuous and redundant. chemokines bind to several chemokines, including: CCL3 (MIP-1alpha/Macrophage Inflammatory Protein b-chemokine), CCL4 (MIP- 1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL16 (HCC CCR5 receptor is constitutively expressed in astrocytes, microglia and neurons [18-20] it seems to regulate leukocyte maturation and trafficking in models of brain disease [21]. results showed 100% of mortality at 4 days post-infection. Statistically significant results were indicated by ***p 0.001, **p 0.01 and *p 0.05. CCR5-/- infected mice present changes in viral load. compared to infected mice at 1dpi. number of leukocytes (A), neutrophils (B), T lymphocytes CD8+ (C) and CD4+ (D) were evaluated in WT and CCR5-/- mice. results are expressed as mean SD and *p 0.05, ***p 0.001. infected mouse (A) and CCR5-/- animal (D) showed infiltration of immune cells in the meninges (B-C); intense meningitis characterized by infiltration of polimorphonuclear and mononuclear in CCR5-/- mouse (E-F). intravital microscopy, the brain was removed to evaluate the levels of the chemokines KC/CXCL1, MIG/CXCL9, MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5 and the cytokine TNF- by ELISA. at 1dpi, all chemokines and cytokine TNF- were significantly increased in infected CCR5-/- mice when compared to infected WT mice. WT and CCR5-/- mice were intracerebrally inoculated with 104 PFU of virus HSV-1. survival was assessed daily. brains were collected, macerated, and inoculated into vero cell cultures. WT and CCR5-/- mice were infected with 104 PFU of HSV-1 by intracranial route and brain removed at 1dpi (n = 4) brain-sequestered cells were counted and then stained with specific antibodies. Flow cytometry, according to size and granularity, was performed as analysis. polimorphonuclear cells, mainly neutrophils, were the predominant inflammatory leukocytes found in the brain of CCR5-/- infected mice. brain histopathological changes after intracerebral inoculation of 104 PFU of HSV-1 in WT and CCR5-/- mice, at 1 dpi. intravital microscopy was used to assess rolling (A) and adhesion (B) of leukocytes on the brain microvasculature, at 1 dpi. data indicate mean SD of cells per minutes (A) and 100 mm (B) CCR5-/- mice infected with HSV-1 virus present increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brain, composed mainly of neutrophils. a lower HSV-1 load was observed in CCR5-/- infected mice by ocular route. this might suggest either that the virus presented a diminished replication rate or that the inflammatory response could be enhancing viral clearance in the brain. this neutrophil response is known to both inhibit viral replication and induce corneal lesion [27,28]. the number of recruited neutrophils in the cornea became similar in WT and CCR5-/- mice only at day 7 p.i. this was probably secondary to defective neutrophil trafficking. TNFR1 seemed relevant for the control of HSV-1 replication in the periphery. the use of intracranial route is a way to elicit an immune response directly from the CNS. TNFR1 seemed relevant for the control of HSV-1 replication in the periphery. one study reported no significant differences in viral load or viral reactivation when the virus was injected in cornea of mice lacking CD8+ T cells. another showed persistent elevated viral titers in the brain of CD8-deficient mice. this suggests a role for CD8+ T cells in the control of HSV-1 replication. infected mice showed a significant elevation in chemokines MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, MIP1-/CCL3 and IP10/CXCL10 in the trigeminal ganglion and brainstem. the increase in chemokine concentration within the brain was also found in a study addressing the role of CXCR3 in HSV-1 infection. the absence of CXCR3 expression would suppress the capacity of T cells to respond to HSV-1 infection through limited trafficking to the trigeminal ganglia. however, it is not clear whether the virus depends on this receptor to enhance viral multiplication or the immune system mounts a different response in its absence. titers obtained were 1.1 108 PFU/mL for HSV-1. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (150 mg/Kg) and xylazine (10 mg/Kg) a craniotomy was performed using a high-speed drill. the dura mater was removed to expose the underlying pial vasculature. the exposed brain was continuously superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid buffer. the 5 m paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined at the optical level with an Olympus Microscope. the description of cells was performed in a blind fashion by a single observer using image processing software. the brain was homogenized in extraction solution (100 mg of tissue per 1 mL), containing: 0.4 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA, 0.1 mM brains were removed and adherent leukocytes isolated using a previously described protocol with minor modifications. each sample corresponds a pool of 2-3 mice brains. 20,000 cells from the lymphocyte population were scored for each sample. limits for the quadrant markers were always set based on negative populations and isotype controls. titers obtained were 1.1 108 PFU/mL for HSV-1. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (150 mg/Kg) and xylazine (10 mg/Kg) and the tail vein was cannulated for administration of fluorescent dyes. leukocytes were fluorescently labeled by intravenous administration of Rhodamine 6 G- Sigma (0.5 mg/kg body weight) three vessels were analyzed for animal. the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes was determined offline during video playback analysis. ELISA of the proteins in the CNS Brain tissue extracts was obtained from control and experimental mice after intravital microscopy. the brain was homogenized in extraction solution (100 mg of tissue per 1 mL), containing: 0.4 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA, 0.1 mM Phenil metil sulfonil fluoride, 10 mM EDTA and 20 KI aprotinin. cells were centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes. the pellet was resuspended on a 35% Percoll gradient. cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer. analysis in FlowJo software took into account size (forward light scatter) and granularity (side light scatter) of populations. Frequency in number of an analyzed population in front of total acquired events was used in construction of graphs."}
