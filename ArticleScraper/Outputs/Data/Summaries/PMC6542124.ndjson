{"summary": "influenza viruses infect 5% to 15% of the global population. heaviest burden is among high-risk groups that include pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions. this study aimed to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza virus among SARI patients. it was based on the analysis of the surveillance data of SARI patients who were admitted in the 2 sentinel sites from January 2011 to December 2016. the total nucleic acid (TNA) is extracted from 200 L of each sample using the MagMAXTM Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit with the MagMAXTM Express-96 Deep Well Magnetic Particle Processor (Applied Viosystems1) the TNA is analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for adenovirus (AdV) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) to multivariate analyses of factors associated with ICU admission and fatal outcome among SARI patients were assessed by using binary logistic regression. a P value of less than.05 was considered statistically significant. based on the analysis of the surveillance data of SARI patients who were admitted in the 2 sentinel sites from January 2011 to December 2016. the total nucleic acid (TNA) is extracted from 200 L of each sample using the MagMAXTM Express-96 Deep Well Magnetic Particle Processor (Applied Viosystems1) the TNA is analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for adenovirus (AdV) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) to detect viral RNA for respiratory syncytial virus ( results Patients\u2019 Characteristics During 2011 to 2016, a total of 1811 SARI patients were tested for respiratory virus. about 78% of patients were 15 years old. of those, 74% were admitted to Aden site, 47% were males, and 18% had chronic disease. 7 6 1 74 8 Male 895 49 43 5 18 2 129 14 39 4 72 8 6 1 44 5 P =.013 P =.002 P =.247 P =.003 P =.445 P =.967 P =.006 Site Aden 1084 60 36 3 9 1 176 16 63 6 103 10 2 0 64 6 Sana\u2019a 727 40 31 4 13 2 103 14 46 6 34 5 10 1 54 7 P =.291 P =.068 89 (5%) of SARI patients, 76 (4%) influenza type A and 22 (1%) influenza type B. noninfluenza viruses were detected in 655 (36%) of SARI patients. a total of 731 (40%) patients were admitted to ICU. there was no significant difference in the rate of ICU admission according to patient\u2019s characteristics and respiratory viruses. the fatality rate was 8% among SARI patients 15 years old compared with patients 15 years old. higher fatality rate was seen among SARI patients 15 years old. 15 years old (9% vs 5%) among SARI patients who were admitted to Aden site compared with Sana\u2019a site (10% vs 5%), among SARI patients who had chronic disease compared with patients without chronic diseases (13% vs 7%.001) and among patients with positive influenza B compared with patients not infected with the same virus (23% vs 8%). increased age significantly associated with lower fatality. a total of 1811 SARI patients were tested for respiratory virus. about 78% of patients were 15 years old. of those, 74% were admitted to Aden site, 47% were males, and 18% had chronic disease. 340 P =.001 Gender Female 916 51 24 3 4 0.4 150 16 70 8 65 7 6 1 74 8 Male 895 49 43 5 18 2 129 14 39 4 72 8 6 1 44 5 P =.013 P =.002 P =.247 P =.003 P =.445 P =.967 P =.006 Site Aden 1084 60 36 3 9 1 176 16 63 6 103 10 2 0 64 6 Sana\u2019a 727 40 31 4 13 noninfluenza viruses were detected in 89 (5%) of SARI patients, 76 (4%) influenza type A and 22 (1%) influenza type B. influenza type B was significantly more common among patients 15 years old except hMPV. ICU admission and Fatality Outcome Table 2 shows the ICU admission and fatality according to patients\u2019 characteristics and respiratory viruses. there was no significant difference in the rate of ICU admission according to demographic or clinical characteristic of SARI patients. 1.0.16 53 13 2.1 (1.5-3.0) 1.0.001 No 1400 553 40 92 7 Influenza viruses Type A +ve 67 10 14 0.2 (0.1-0.5) 1.001 3 5 0.5 (0.2-1.7) 1.27 \u2013ve 1744 721 41 142 8 Type B +ve 22 2 9 0.1 (0.03-0.6) 1.002 5 23 3.5 (1.2-9.5) 1.01 \u2013ve 1789 729 41 140 8 Noninfluenza viruses higher fatality rate was seen among SARI patients 15 years old compared with 15 years old (9% vs 5%) among SARI patients who had chronic disease compared with patients without chronic diseases (13% vs 7%.001) among SARI patients who had chronic disease compared with patients without chronic diseases (13% vs 7%.001) and among patients with positive influenza B compared with patients not infected with the same virus (23% vs 8%). study analyzed data for 1811 SARI patients. 78% were 15 years old, 60% were admitted to Aden site, 51% were females, and 23% had chronic diseases. this result was similar to previous reports in Yemen and Jordan. this finding had been reported in other EMARIS network countries including Oman, Jordan, and Egypt. however, RSV was found to be predominant in this study but it is less frequent than what had been reported in other studies. study found 18 chronic diseases were associated with fatality outcome. not all cases were tested for viral respiratory pathogens. other viral and bacterial etiologies might contribute to severity of disease."}
