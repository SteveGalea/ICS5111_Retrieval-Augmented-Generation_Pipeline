{"summary": "HBoV has been reported worldwide to be present in 1.5% to 11.3% of respiratory samples tested from individuals with acute respiratory illness [7-10] there have been no studies reporting the detection of HBoV DNA in children with LRTI from china. this has demonstrated a presence of HBoV DNA in children with respiratory tract infection in china. blood samples tested negative for antibodies directed against influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. all the blood samples tested negative for antibodies directed against influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. the amplicon and the TaqMan probe for this HBoV specific quantitative PCR were designed by Primer Express 2.0.0 software(Applied Biosystems) the sequences are as follows: forward primer, 5' AGC TTT TGA TTC AAG GCT ATA ATC (HBoV nts 1417 to 1444); reverse primer, 5' TGT TTC CCG AAT TTG TTC A'3 (HBoV nts 1500 to 1480); and the probe aspirated sputum F 13 mo Fever with cough for 10 day 1.46 107 Pneumonia WL108 Aspirated sputum F 1 yr Fever with cough for 5 day, seizure once 3.95 109 Pneumonia WL109 Sputum F 7 yr Fever for 2 days, 4.01 103 Bronchitis WL221 Aspirated sputum M 2 yr Fever and cough for 2 days 6.95 105 Bro a reliable means to screen samples with high titers of genomic copies for virus isolation and to address the relationship between HBoV and LRTI in children in china. author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."}
