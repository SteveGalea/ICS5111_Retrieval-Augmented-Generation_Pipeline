{"summary": "a total of 4.0 g of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 g of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells. the mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. from 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among six tested tissues. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1."}
