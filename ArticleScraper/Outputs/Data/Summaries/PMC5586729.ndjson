{"summary": "synthetic biology includes technologies for DNA synthesis and assembly of fragments of DNA for gene synthesis. synthetic genomics can be applied to microorganisms to produce chemicals more efficiently than by genetic engineering. synthetic biology devices contribute not only to improve understanding of disease mechanisms, but also provide novel diagnostic tools. the concept of personalized medicine as systems medicine is the best way of integrating new technologies and translating them into clinical application for improving healthcare. nanobiotechnology has already helped in the development of personalized medicine [5]. Biological therapies are making significant contribution to personalized medicine. new cells have expected phenotypic properties and are capable of continuous self-replication. synthetic bacteria have 14 \u2018watermark sequences\u2019 attached to their genome. they behaved and divided in laboratory dishes like natural bacteria. transcriptional biosensors are built by linking environment-responsive promoters to engineered gene circuits for programmed transcription. posttranslational biosensors consist of membrane-bound protein receptors that trigger signal transduction cascades. ability to control expression in target areas within a genome is important for synthetic biologists who are developing chemical-producing organisms for commercial applications. team of scientists made more than a million stably folded strings of amino acids from genetic sequences distinct from those known to occur naturally. they then screened these synthetic proteins in dozens of E. coli strains missing essential genes. 18 of the artificial proteins could rescue the growth of 4 E. coli mutant strains missing essential enzyme-coding genes serB, gltA, ilvA or fes. the genome sequence is an organism's blueprint: the set of instructions dictating its biological traits. it is more relevant for synthetic biology as well as translation into diagnostics and clinical applications. researchers built up the synthetic genome of mycoplasma mycoides. synthetic biosensing is an important activity due to myriads of cell signaling pathways and circuits in cells. transcriptional biosensors are built by linking environment-responsive promoters to engineered gene circuits for programmed transcription. synthetic proteins have been created that can function in Escherichia coli. they are molecular machines that function quite well within a living organism. the synthetic proteins are substantially less active and may function by different mechanisms than natural proteins they replace. synthetic biology and microencapsulation have opened the door to novel and innovative cell-based biomedical applications. synthetic biology is more versatile than genetic engineering for the development of biopharmaceuticals such as oral vaccines and engineered stem cells. systems medicine can reconstruct genome-scale models for study of the function of specific enzymes and pathways in the context of the complete metabolic network. biosynthesis of artemisinin has led to manufacture and commercialization of the drug at low cost for developing countries. synthetic biology enables redesigning of cells to produce desirable molecules with higher efficacy and lower toxicity. synthetic biology enables redesigning of cells to produce desirable molecules with higher efficacy and lower toxicity. synthetic biology can be used for pathway modeling to improve understanding of the mechanisms of cellular signaling. it is necessary to chart sequence specificity of natural and engineered DNA-binding molecules in a programmable manner. to achieve these goals, it is necessary to chart the sequence specificity of natural and engineered DNA-binding molecules. aptamer-binding proteins are versatile and powerful building blocks for the construction of artificial genetic switches. an aptamer-based construct regulating the Tet Off system in a tetracycline-independent manner has been shown to achieve control of transgene expression. it could also be used as a safeguard for regulation of gene expression in microencapsulated cell implants. new systematic methods for de novo biosynthetic pathway prediction are enabling the exploration of the metabolic chemical space beyond metabolic engineering. computer-assisted design of modular assembly lines in polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases may enable the development of tailor-made antibiotics. advances in metabolic engineering provide novel strategies for engineering antimicrobial agents with desired specificities. synthetic biology is more versatile than genetic engineering for the development of biopharmaceuticals such as oral vaccines and engineered stem cells or bacteria to detect and treat tumors. elucidation of molecular mechanisms is important for developing an effective and personalized approach for human metabolic disorders. synthetic biology can be used in drug discovery, e.g. translation of signals identified in genome-wide association studies. next generation sequencing is also being used directly in drug discovery to identify variants associated with common traits. synthetic biology can be used to design drugs with less adverse effects and improved efficacy. pharmacogenomics implies the use of genetic sequence and genomics information of the host (normal or diseased) or of the pathogen to enable therapy decisions. synthetic biology can be used for pathway modeling to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of cellular signaling. a synthetic multi-enzyme glyoxylate shunt has been used to protect mice. this shunt prevents the complete oxidation of fatty acids in plants and bacteria. but when introduced in mice, it increases fatty acid oxidation. synthetic homing endonuclease-based gene drive system can be used to spread genetic modifications, e.g. as resistance against malaria from engineered mosquitoes to the field population. advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology provide novel strategies for engineering antimicrobial agents with desired specificities. ing devices with the body's endogenous network and novel therapeutic approaches generate numerous opportunities for future biomedical applications. different types of cells including embryonic stem cells are now being employed for therapy. many new technologies are used to modify as well as synthesize cells. reprogramming and directing cell fate can be applied for basic research and regenerative medicine. synthetic microenvironments offer new ways to control stem cell fate, e.g. differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into tissues that most closely match the mechanical properties of the substrate upon which they are cultured. the development of new vaccines is limited by several drawbacks. risks associated with the use of attenuated pathogens and difficulties altering vaccine target specificity. synthetic biology can help develop improved vaccine candidates in considerably less time compared to conventional approaches. system combines antigen production, adjuvants and delivery in one system. Availability of genome sequences, high throughput technologies and synthetic biology has enabled reverse vaccinology (RV) the empiric approach to vaccine development is being replaced by vaccine design. ign and results indicate that Vaxign is an accurate and efficient vaccine design program. in situ generation of enzymes and proteins is a prerequisite for constructing functional cells. liposomes have been studied as the most likely precursors of biological cells. complex biochemical reactions have been described inside liposomes. synthetic biology-based vaccines focus on live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated microorganisms, and subunits thereof. the development of new vaccines is limited by several drawbacks, including risks associated with the use of attenuated pathogens. synthetic biology can help develop improved vaccine candidates in considerably less time compared to conventional approaches. peptide nanoparticles are multifunctional with high binding affinity and specificity. this platform was used to design and produce a prototypic malaria vaccine that can display a tandem repeat of the circumsporozoite protein of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei [32] reverse vaccinology (RV) is one of the most powerful examples of biotechnology applied to the field of vaccinology for identifying new protein-based vaccines. the application of RV to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B represents the first success of this novel approach.
