{"summary": "EGCG and other catechins contribute to these effects mainly through their antioxidative and prooxidative properties [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. CMDA has been used to reveal further intricacies of the interaction between SA and catechins. Ikeda et al. demonstrated that a gallate ester moiety at the C-3 position enhanced the binding ability of catechins to bovine SA by interacting with both Trp134 and Trp213 via - stacking. EGCG was also shown to interact with Glu130, Glu165, and Glu284, located on the surface of BSA, through hydrogen bonds. catechin aggregates are loosely packed with a rough surface, suggesting a role of the gallate moiety in aggregate formation. findings provide a basic understanding of catechin-induced formation and aggregation of protein complexes. they discussed catechin-protein interaction as part of the mechanism of catechin\u2019s beneficial actions in health. DA demonstrated a binding interaction between EGCG and several amino acid residues in EGCG. a galloyl moiety in EGCG interacts with amino acid residues such as Phe201, His401, Glu402, His 411, and Pro421. EGCG and ECG had 1.5-fold higher binding affinity with MMP-9 than EC and EGC. EGCG exhibited much stronger inhibitory activity than catechin. CMDA showed that methylation causes the ester carbon in these catechins to move away or be blocked entirely from Thr1 of this subunit. Kongpichitchoke et al. examined the effect of gallic acid on protein kinase C (PKC) [25]. they showed that the content of gallic acid increased depending on the degree of fermentation of tea and that gallic acid reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phorbol ester-activated macrophages. thus, gallic acid at certain concentrations may protect cell death. chromenylchalcone 11 showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 93.1 nM. the compound inhibited aurora kinases, and the mechanism could be examined by CMDA. CMDA of a -catenine-catechin complex may be useful for screening -catenin inhibitors as anticancer drugs [29]. phytochemicals such as wedelolactones and catechin were analyzed by several methods, including CMDA. farhan et al. found the relative efficiency of cellular DNA breakage in the order of EGCG > EGC > EC > catechin. the order of DNA binding affinity was confirmed by CMDA and a thermodynamic study using calf thymus DNA. their results suggest that the synthesis of any novel anticancer molecule should have as many galloyl moieties as possible. LT-1A1 found that EGCG could control the opening and closure states of SULT-1A1 [36]. findings may be useful to understand allosteric regulation by EGCG and other compounds, and develop a drug that can enhance or diminish SULT activity. flavonoids have been found to possess anticancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors such as CDK6. flavonoids have been found to possess anticancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors such as CDK6. pKi values were 3.81 1.94, 0.20 0.06, 0.31 0.07, 0.65 0.27 for BP-1-102, gingektin, withaferin A, and EGCG respectively. the amino acids involved in binding of the compounds to STAT3 are located in the Src homology 2 domain of the protein. sirtuin-6 (SIRT6) is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase. flavonoids can affect SIRT6 activity in a structure-dependent manner. cyanidin produced a 55-fold increase in SIRT6 activity, while other flavonoids induced the 3\u201310-fold increase. a cross-sectional study on 1143 patients with a mean age of 68.9 in japan found an association between low green tea consumption (p for trend = 0.032) with a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment [58]. a cross-sectional study on 1143 patients with a mean age of 68.9 in Japan found an association between low green tea consumption (p for trend = 0.58\u20130.73) [57] CMDA showed that catechin present in U. rhynchophylla, and dopamine and norepinephrine present in P. oleracea, had the best docking scores and interaction energy, suggesting that these compounds may be used to treat AD. EGCG is the most promising lead to develop as a multitarget drug against PD. CMDA suggested that EGCG prevents fibril formation by stabilizing the molecule in its native-like state. EGCG is a generic inhibitor of amyloid-fibril formation. this finding may be useful to understand catechin\u2019s inhibitory effect on protein fibril formation. EGCG binds either to Pro59 (P59) with low affinity and no precipitation. more EGCG molecules are recruited to the binding site. this leads to the association of further proteins. this makes EGCG a promising lead structure. CMDA has revealed the mode of interaction of catechins with proteins related to MetS and related diseases. the -glucosidase inhibitor acarbose is a common oral antidiabetic drug. CMDA indicated that EGCG can inhibit glucose generation by binding to the active site of -amylase, leading to a caloric restriction-like effect. sun et al. examined the interactions between pancreatic -amylase (PPA) and tea polyphenols by biochemical and physicochemical methods. XCA showed that flavonoid ring systems and their hydroxyl substitutions are important for the binding of flavonoids to kinases. the findings by Wright et al. predict that quercetin would inhibit the activity of Src family kinases with greater potency than apigenin and catechin. CMDA has provided a molecular basis to explain how catechins exert anti-microbial effects. EGCG inhibited enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with an IC50 of 17.4 M by interfering with the binding of NADH to the enzyme. CMDA suggested that the benzopyran ring of EGCG penetrates deeply into the active site. the galloyl moiety anchors it to the cleft through interactions with its hydroxyl groups. EGCG and similar polyphenolic ligands likely bind to the channel at the surface of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B. DA predicted that EGCG binds to the toxin\u2019s A-6 region. but the hydroxyl group in the A-ring is involved in binding to Tyr91. EGCG inhibited the major functions of these proteins, leading to the inhibition of B. subtilis. EGCG directly inhibited PLY mediated haemolysis and cytolysis by blocking the oligomerization of PLY and simultaneously reducing the peptidase activity of SrtA. CMDA predicted that EGCG binds to Glu277, Tyr358, and Arg359 in PLY and Thr169, Lys171, and Phe239 in SrtA. EGCG bound with CD4 in such a way that the calculated binding affinity of gp120 with the CD4\u2013EGCG complex was negligible. it was suggested that EGCG can block CD4-gp120 binding, with an IC50 of about 100 M. these findings would be useful for the development of next-generation anti-HIV-1 drugs. procyanidin B2-digallate was identified as the main active principle of RA. RA and PBD blocked the attachment of IAV and interfered with viral penetration at higher concentrations. chikungunya fever is a viral disease that may cause chronic arthritis. CMDA studies on interactions between catechins and cholera toxin, dengue virus envelope glycoprotein E, and papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein have already been discussed. EGCG and catechin derivatives are suggested to have a role as preventive agents for immunological disorders such as food allergy and rheumatoid arthritis. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that green tea containing O-methylated catechins reduces binding of EGCG to 2S albumins affected protein conformation by causing a transition from an -helix to a -structure. binding of EGCG to 2S albumins affected protein conformation by causing a transition from an -helix to a -structure. the effect of EGCG on anaphylactic reactions remains unknown. CMDA and molecular dynamics simulation suggest tannin can make close contact with a variety of amino acid residues on the peptide. both enzymes have some common substrates, but each also has specific substrates. EC and catechin exhibited a high affinity to both enzymes. synthetic MMP inhibitor Batimastat exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor growth, tissue invasion, and intrahepatic and lung metastasis. EGCG and ECG have been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of MMPs. CMDA demonstrated a binding interaction between EGCG and several amino acid residues in EGCG. binding of EGCG to trypsin\u2019s catalytic cavity involves hydrogen bonding provided by the hydroxyl groups in the galloyl residue, whereas that of catechin uses those in the B-ring. EGCG exhibited much stronger inhibitory activity than catechin. CMDA showed that methylation causes the ester carbon in these catechins to move away or be blocked entirely from Thr1. methylation inhibits the binding of these catechins to the proteasome 5 subunit, which would reduce their anticancer activity. dutta et al. synthesized novel catechin/EC-based conjugates with resorcinol and phloroglucinol to increase the number of phenolic OH groups. the conjugates were more effective inhibitors of ribonuclease A than parental catechins. CMDA revealed the precise protein-catechin interactions. CMDA found binding energy of known inhibitors isorhamnetin, fisetin, genistein and silibinin is about 5 kcal/mol. interactions of catechin and -catenin involved six hydrogen bonds, two with -catenin residue Lys312, and one each with Tyr306, Gly307, Lys345 and Arg386. a ligand-based search was carried out, showing 90% similarity in the Pubchem database. a new candidate (Pubchem CID: 11363378) that demonstrated considerable affinity towards Hsp90 was identified. their study can serve as a model for searching for anticancer drugs based on protein-ligand interaction. sulfotransferases are phase II detoxification enzymes that regulate the activity of more than hundreds of small molecules with an allosteric effect. genetic variation in SULT1A1 is associated with the risk of certain types of cancer including lung cancer. findings may be useful to understand allosteric regulation by EGCG and other compounds. hesperidin and rutin had the highest fitting scores in the active sites of CYP3A4 with binding energy of about 74 and 71 kcal/mol. the corresponding value of catechin was about 39 kcal/mol, showing that it is a very weak inhibitor. flavonoids have been found to possess anticancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors such as CDK6. a41, Glu61, Phe98, Gln103, Aap163, and Leu152 contributed to the binding affinity. these binding features of flavonoid inhibitors may provide valuable insight into the development of CDK6 inhibitors as chemopreventive agents. these amino acids involved in binding of the compounds to STAT3 are located in the Src homology 2 domain of the protein. the sample compounds provided in this study would be very useful for selecting and designing phytochemicals and drugs for cancer chemoprevention [40]. factor-1 receptor [43], vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF1-receptor and VEGF2-receptor [44], zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70 [45], tyrosine kinases [46], tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [47], urokinase [48], lipase [50], hydroxymethylglutaryl inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) have potential in the treatment of AD. CMDA revealed polyphenols inhibit the binding to AChE and BChE. EGCG is the most promising lead to develop as a multitarget drug against PD. previous studies reported that EGCG can bind to unfolded native polypeptides and prevent conversion to amyloid fibrils. CMDA suggested that EGCG prevents fibril formation by stabilizing the molecule in its native-like state. EGCG is known to interfere with fibril formation by inducing protein aggregations. CMDA identified two distinct EGCG binding sites, both of which include proline as a binding residue. EGCG reacts selectively with amyloidogenic mutants. tkowska et al. proposed an additional way in which EGCG might affect trisomy 21. EGCG was reported to inhibit urokinase [48] and docked well with it. thus, EGCG may inhibit MMP-9 in the brain and slow the degradation of NGF, thus preventing DS [72]. -glucosidase inhibitor acarbose is a common oral anti-diabetic drug. three selected polyphenolic compounds inhibited the activities of these enzymes when applied at less than 0.5 mM. three selected polyphenolic compounds inhibited the activities of these enzymes when applied at less than 0.5 mM. chi and isothermal titration calorimetry are very similar among these polyphenols. they suggest that the galloyl moiety in these polyphenols binds to PPA and promotes polyphenol entering and association with the active site of the enzyme. flavonoids may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting the activity of kinases such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase. catechins have antibacterial activity and can modify properties of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. incubation of MRSA with ECG inhibited bacterial growth. green tea powder greatly potentiated the effect of interferon/rivabirin therapy in intractable chronic hepatitis C patients. curcumin showed highest binding energy (about 9 kcal) with universal stress protein. quercetin and catechin had the larger binding energy values. EGCG had the highest activity, followed by ECG and EC. the galloyl group in EGCG was responsible for binding to Tyr91 in the A-6 region of the toxin\u2019s active site [89]. the hydroxyl group of the A ring of EGCG forms a hydrophobic bond with Tyr91. CMDA also predicted that EGC binds to the toxin\u2019s A-6 region, similar to EGCG, but that the hydroxyl group in the A-ring is involved in binding to Tyr91. CMDA showed that EGCG binds to basic amino acids located in the inner wall of OPPA through hydrogen bonding. CMDA predicted that EGCG binds to Glu277, Tyr358, and Arg359 in PLY and Thr169, Lys171, and Phe239 in SrtA. gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to cell surface CD4 is the initial step of viral entry into cells. EGCG is an inhibitor which blocks gp120-CD4 binding. gp120\u2013CD4\u2013EGCG binding complexes in water were negligible. proanthocyanidin-enriched extract inhibited growth of IAV strain PR8 (H1N1) and clinical isolate of IAV(H1N1)pdm09 with IC50s of 2.5 and 2.2 g/mL. RA extracts were also active against an oseltamivir-resistant isolate. kcal/mol and rosmarinic acid had slightly larger binding energy. these compounds may serve as lead compounds to develop antiviral drugs.

XCA of EGCG-Protein Complexes Lipoxygenases are non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. XCA of soybean lipoxygenase-3 complexed with EGCG revealed an inhibitor depicting EGC that lacks the galloyl moiety. four diketo compounds can chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. differences in substituent groups on the basic metal binding scaffold can be orientated to bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity. their findings may be important in optimizing the design of more potent inhibitors targeting virus polymerases. XCA of Ara h 8 binds EC, and their complex was determined in 2.0 resolution. leucoanthocyanidin reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of flavan-diols. the structure of the ternary complex indicates the - interactions between (+)-catechin and the nicotinamide ring of NADPH. this result indicates that catechins could bind to the active site and interact directly with the cofactor. XCA of EGCG-Protein Complexes Lipoxygenases are non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. XCA of soybean lipoxygenase-3 complexed with EGCG revealed an inhibitor depicting EGC that lacks the galloyl moiety. CMDA revealed that the EGCG binding site on the C-terminal domain of troponin C lies in the hydrophobic pocket in the absence of troponin I. this interaction of EGCG with the C-terminal domain of troponin C-troponin I complex has not been shown with other cardiotonic molecules. previously, EGCG was shown to bind directly to peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1) which plays a critical role the highest incidence of hydrogen bonding was found in the EGCG-PA endonuclease complex. the hydrophilic nature of the galloyl group might be involved in the interaction with water molecules. CMDA and XCA have provided detailed information about the interaction between catechins and proteins. DA, Farhan et al. proposed that the synthesis of any novel anticancer drug should have as many galloyl moieties as possible. conformational changes in protein induces further binding of EGCG to serum immunoglobulin light chains as shown in Figure 7 [32]"}
