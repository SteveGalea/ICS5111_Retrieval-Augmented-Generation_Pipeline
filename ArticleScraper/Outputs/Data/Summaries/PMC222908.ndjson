{"summary": "the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed model cannot account for patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. this has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. this outbreak started a world-wide epidemic after a medical doctor infected several persons at an hotel in Kowloon around February 21st, 2003. the pattern of the outbreak became puzzling after an estate in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected by the virus apparently causing the disease. this pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic pattern for reasons that have to be analyzed. the most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recombination event from virus B [4-6], but would cause an overlapping immune response of the host. both epidemics would spread in parallel, and it can be expected that the epidemic caused by virus B protects against SARS. this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do not include isolated infectives in the class R. the progress of individuals is schematically described by S I R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. the limiting value R, called the total size of the epidemic, is the total number of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. r0 = r/a is the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population. the graph has several peaks and it looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. however, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a curve whose values are within a narrow range (say 15 to 25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. the SIR model is \"hidden\" in the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contributing to the propagation of the epidemic. a small change in the parameters can result in a large difference in the values of R. this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. another possibility is that a different, but similar disease that spread before (or is spreading simultaneously with SARS) has immunized some of the population against SARS. as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. we assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. the population can then be divided into six distinct classes. the rate of removal of infectives in class I to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of people in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. the rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of people in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. an average infective of disease A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN others per unit time. the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. we are interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. the \"dynamic\" protection is given by a protective epidemic or a vaccine leaving some of the population immune. the \"dynamic\" protection is when the protective epidemic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. we will apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usually highly contagious. we assume that IP(0) = 0.5 million, that is 0.5 million people are infected by disease B. only 10 people infected by disease B are infected by disease B. the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. the observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. case b We consider the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 people are infected by disease B. the statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Beijing are obtained from http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. the initial population was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to obtain the best fit. the graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. the first approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. the second approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. the value of the b parameter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus the onset to admission interval. the usual number of social contacts of a person is higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong. we assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. the population can then be divided into three distinct classes. the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease, the infectives, I, who have the disease and can transmit it. the removed class, R, is those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. the function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. the time t0 is the critical point of the function at which. it follows from the equation SIR-2 that the relation rS(t0) = a holds. figure 2 shows the daily number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003. the graph can be considered as an approximation of. the graph has several peaks and it looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. the limiting case of the SEIR model is when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero. for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic is the same in the two models. the same level of admissions per day will result in a higher total epidemic size for the SEIR model than for the SIR model. sensitivity in the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic. we are lead to consider a model for which the effective population, i.e. the total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. a large portion of the total population is protected during the epidemic. governing the SEIRP model can decay extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. we assume that two groups of infected individuals are introduced into a large population. one group is infected by virus A and the other by virus B. the gain in the exposed class E is proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the susceptibles S, that is rS(t)I(t) where rP > 0 is a constant. the susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t) the incubation period is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. the model mechanism is then governed by the following system of non-linear ordinary differential equations. an average infective of disease A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN others per unit time, where N is the total population. two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can be seen as particular cases of a double epidemic model. the \"dynamic\" protection is when the protective epidemic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. we will apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. most of the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from the community stayed around 15 to 25. we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus. we assume that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus. we fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003. Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. the limiting value of the curve R is 1011. both the parameters rP and a are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much smaller than the previous case. disease B needs to spread much faster in order to \"protect\" people from being infected. the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. the observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. case b We consider the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 people are infected by disease B. the statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Beijing are obtained from http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. the initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that characterise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit. the graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. the first approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. the second approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. the value of the b parameter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus the onset to admission interval. the usual number of social contacts of a person is higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong. the first epidemic of the XXIst century is the severe acute Respiratory syndrome. we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic. they may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the immediate future. we explored two major situations: one when the epidemics pneumonia types exist. socio-political constraints cast significant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the population of pigs in Europe [10,15] a discrete model involving stochastic parameters would be more adapted. a second constraint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior of the epidemic is so complex that it would require many parameters to be represented, implying that a very large set of causes would account for the observations. a double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single epidemic. the double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single epidemic. a second, perhaps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible. if our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. this may also account for some of the variability observed at different places. this might be substantiated by sequencing CoV genomes isolated from many patients. this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of predicted curves with actual recent data indicate that the containment measures are effective. this model, that assumes a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created."}
