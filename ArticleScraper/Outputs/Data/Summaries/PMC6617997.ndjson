{"summary": "viruses have evolved a plethora of strategies to shape host-cell metabolism. this is often accompanied by upregulation of the ingestion of an extracellular carbon source (e.g., glucose or glutamine) and a redirection of these carbon supplies to metabolic pathways crucial for viral replication. glucose and glutamine: Virus-induced Feeding of the Tricarboxylic acid cycle. cells maintain their energy production mainly by aerobic glycolysis. pyruvate is converted to lactate, which is then eliminated by efflux from the cell. this phenomenon can be observed even under normal oxygen conditions. 2-DG is a glucose analog that impairs the function of phosphoglucose isomerase and thus results in both an inhibition of glycolysis and the processing of glucose toward the TCA cycle. a possible explanation could be that the uptake of glucose mainly shifted to nucleotide synthesis pathways rather than glycolysis or the TCA cycle. further carbon flux analysis delineated how an increase in glucose uptake results in a fast processing through glycolysis and the TCA cycle toward fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis. early HCMV gene expression was shown to be responsible for the changes in glycolytic flux. calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (AMPK) inhibition abolished the HCMV-induced metabolic alterations. iter virus replication could be restored by the addition of TCA cycle metabolites. recent research has also established a role of the viral protein UL38 in the upregulation of glucose and glutamine (and other amino acid) consumption. EBV causes infectious mononucleosis, and its latent infection is associated with the development of various malignant diseases. glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 were needed to support cell proliferation in KSHV-transformed cancer cells. de-novo and latent KSHV infection of endothelial cells and B cells induces glutaminase expression, partly c-Myc dependent. inhibition of glutaminase by CB-839 impaired adenovirus, HSV-1, and influenza A replication (35). all DNA viruses discussed so far induce glycolysis and/or increase glucose uptake in the course of infection. however, an exception to this is the vaccinia virus (VACV) amplification of glucose uptake was detectable as fast as 1.5 h upon infection. however, the enhanced uptake was reversible by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition. this suggests a role of this pathway in mediating RV's effects. RV infection activates the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in elevated nucleotide levels that support viral replication. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NS1) stimulates and requires glycolysis for optimal replication. hepatitis C virus (HCV) was also shown to increase glucose demand and enhance glycolysis in infected cells (44, 45). hepatitis C virus (HCV) was also shown to increase glucose demand and enhance glycolysis in infected cells (44, 45). phospholipase D1 (PLD1) was found to be a crucial regulator of the HIV-1-induced metabolic alterations in CD4+ T cells (48). the pharmacologic inhibition of PLD-1 led to a reduction in HIV-1 replication (48). the alterations induced by both viruses induced similar changes in infected macrophages. but there were differences observed in the levels of quinolinate, a tryptophan pathway component (56) abrantes et al. found that HSV-1 increased the glucose uptake, lactate efflux, and ATP content of HSV-1 infected cells. the virus instead triggered anaplerotic (glutamine-dependent) feeding of the TCA cycle and an enhancement of pyrimidine synthesis. further carbon flux analysis delineated how an increase in glucose uptake results in a fast processing through glycolysis and the TCA cycle toward fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis. early HCMV gene expression was shown to be responsible for the changes in glycolytic flux. calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase kinase (AMPK) inhibition abolished the HCMV-induced metabolic alterations. the viral protein UL38 was mediated by the modulation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) but was mTOR independent (23). latently infected cells were found to enhance glucose and glutamine uptake and to have deregulated glycolysis (24, 25) these changes were described to have been induced by EBV's latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and were associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling. glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 were needed to support cell proliferation in adenovirus-transformed cancer cells. the authors proposed that glutamate may act as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor during the course of KSHV-induced oncogenic transformation. inhibition of glutaminase by CB-839 impaired adenovirus, HSV-1, and influenza A replication (35). all DNA viruses discussed so far induce glycolysis and/or increase glucose uptake in the course of infection. however, an exception is the vaccinia virus (VACV) amplification of glucose uptake was detectable as fast as 1.5 h upon infection. however, the enhanced uptake was reversible by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition. this suggests a role of this pathway in mediating RV's effects. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) stimulates and requires glycolysis for optimal replication. hepatitis C virus (HCV) was also shown to increase nucleotide levels. the NS5A protein interacts with hexokinase 2 to increase the glycolytic flux (45), and the HCV-regulated microRNA 130a enhances the activity of pyruvate kinase, another key enzyme in glycolysis (46). phospholipase D1 was found to be a crucial regulator of the HIV-1-induced metabolic alterations in infected CD4+ T cells (48\u201353). alterations induced by both viruses induced similar changes in infected macrophages. differences observed in levels of quinolinate, a tryptophan pathway component (56). virion production requires re-orchestration of entire biosynthesis machinery. RCs critically depends on reprogramming of host's sterol synthesis via recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III beta and oxysterol-binding protein (PI4KB\u2013OSBP) axis. disruption of cellular cholesterol homeostasis impairs viral replication. rol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) represent the most important family of transcription factors that transactivate lipogenic genes in order to increase FA and cholesterol syntheses. despite homeostatic conditions, SREBPs are synthesized in an inactive form and are attached to the ER membrane. this binding of the activated SREBP to SRE DNA motifs governs transcriptional control of key lipogenic metabolic enzymes, such as FASN and ACC. inhibition of ELOVL7 impairs HCMV replication. HCMV-infected cells upregulate low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in an mTOR/SREBP-dependent manner. interference with LRP1 disturbs intracellular cholesterol availability. stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is a critical target that regulates the composition of intracellular membranes to induce a favorable microenvironment for optimal DENV2 replication. the pharmacologic inhibition of SCD1 interrupted the generation of monounsaturated FAs, such as oleic acid (C18:1) or palmitoleic acid (C16:1) (69, 83, 84), which consequently affected an optimal lipid membrane composition and membrane fluidity treatment with an inhibitor of FADS2 impaired HCV virion production. inhibition of FASN with C75 reduced HCV replication in vitro. ribavirin suppresses expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP-1c. pharmacologic targeting of SREBP caused the inhibition of several post-viral-entry steps. treatment with AM580 also restricted SREBP-dependent lipogenesis in influenza H1N1-infected cells. elevated levels of multiple long-chain mono- and polyunsaturated FAs have been associated with RV infection. inhibition of FASN with a novel potent inhibitor (TVB-3166) decreased the replication of RV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV 3) (102). both the upstream interference in the glucose flux (using 2-DG) (39) and the downstream inhibition of lipogenesis (101, 102) can serve as new therapeutic targets for treating RV- or RSV-induced respiratory infections. existing evidence has proposed an essential role for several post-translational lipid modifications of HIV-1 structural proteins. this indicates a role for FASN in HIV-1-mediated viral budding or in post-translational modifications of HIV-1 structural proteins. lipid-based antiviral strategies may guide future antiviral therapies. cleavage and downstream targets of HCMV-induced lipogenesis impaired HCMV replication. inhibition of ELOVL7 impairs HCMV replication. HCMV-infected cells upregulate low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in a SREBP-dependent manner, and interference with LRP1 disturbs intracellular cholesterol availability. both DENV and WNV are highly sensitive to the inhibition of ACC or FASN (74\u201378) as well as interferences with cholesterol uptake (79), homeostasis (80), and biosynthesis (81, 82). an urgent need for de novo lipogenesis as well as changes in the intracellular lipid distribution and accumulation of unsaturated FAs have also been proposed to be essential prerequisites for DENV type 2 (DENV2) infection. metabolomic profiling revealed that unsaturated long-chain FAs, such as oleic acid (C18:1), specifically accumulated upon HCV infection. inhibition of FA elongases or desaturases restricted HCV replication. lipidomic analysis has broadened our understanding regarding the metabolic reprogramming that ensues upon human coronavirus (99) and MERS-CoV infections (99, 100). the authors claimed that the Coronaviridae specifically fine-tuned the host lipid profile to achieve optimal viral replication (99) the cells were treated with several inhibitors of enzymes engaged in FA synthesis, elongation, and modification. inhibition of FASN with a novel potent inhibitor decreased the replication of RV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV 3) (102). the inhibition of FASN was shown to impair CHIKV replication. this could be rescued upon exogenous palmitic acid supply (103) the authors were not able to delineate how those de novo-synthesized lipids fuel HIV-1 replication. the current data point toward a dichotomy between DNA and RNA viruses when looking at their respective strategies for host cell manipulation. a distinct virus-specific fingerprint can be found for each virus, which mirrors the needs of the respective pathogen for specific molecular compounds in the process of its replication. we still have limited knowledge on the role of metabolism in the pathogenesis of a plethora of pathogenic viruses, which requires further research. insights into these and other questions will help us to greatly advance our understanding of this crucial host\u2013pathogen interaction.
