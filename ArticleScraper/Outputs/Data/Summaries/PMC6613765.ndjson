{"summary": "coVs represent a group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded viruses with large genomes (27 to 33 kb) they are capable of causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of different severities in diverse animal species, including humans. only alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-CoVs can infect humans. several drugs, such as ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, and corticosteroids, have been used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV. contradictory findings on their efficacy and concerns over tolerability and clinical benefit have limited the use of antiviral therapeutics for CoVs. silvestrol was a potent and nontoxic inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in coV-infected human primary cells. a nucleotide prodrug (GS-5734) could inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems at submicromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Optimal screening conditions were established using the rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc reporter virus to infect BHK-21 cells in 96-well plates. under this condition, the coefficient of variation and Z factor were 2.9% and 0.86, respectively. 56 hits were found to significantly inhibit rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc replication. 5 l of rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 72 h. the percentage inhibition of Rluc activity of rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc is displayed along the vertical axis versus the percentage inhibition of BHK-21 proliferation displayed along the horizontal axis. phenazopyridine, lycorine, pyrvinium pamoate, monensin sodium, cetylpyridinium chloride, oligomycin, loperamide, harmine, and conessine exhibited antiviral activity against severe CoV (MERS-CoV) the

rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc in the mouse brain at 72 h postinoculation. data represent the mean standard deviation (error bars) of the results of three independent experiments. combining antiviral peptides with beta interferon (IFN-) can enhance antiviral therapeutic effects. several reports of enhanced therapeutic effects of combinations of other antiviral agents for the treatment of MERS-CoV. lycorine was confirmed as showing strong anti-CoV activity in vivo. lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate showed inhibitory activity against multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. lycorine is an alkaloid isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants and reportedly exhibits anticancer, antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and emetic activities. emetine is reportedly a potent inhibitor that suppresses replication of several RNA viruses without generating drug-resistant variant viruses (54\u201356). emetine inhibits human cytomegalovirus replication by disrupting the HCMV-induced interaction between p53 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (57). monensin sodium, which affects IBV and MHV-A59 assembly (61, 62), was also identified as an inhibitor of other CoVs. lycorine showed strong antiviral activity against multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro and protected mice against lethal HCoV-OC43 infection in vivo. vero-E6, LLC-MK2, DBT, 293FT, DPP4-expressing Huh7.5 cells, and 17Cl-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium.
