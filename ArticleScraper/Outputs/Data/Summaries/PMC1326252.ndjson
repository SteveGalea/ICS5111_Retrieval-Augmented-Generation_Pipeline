{"summary": "a wide range of biological assays have been well established and are currently used in a wide range of biological assays (1\u20135) the critical need for advanced diagnostic systems in microbiology is to detect rapidly genetic information within the known and unanticipated pathogenic microrganisms associated with the human health (i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi) several groups have immobilized molecular beacons on a solid surface to construct a molecular beacon array to resolve the target DNA sequences spatially (15\u201318) these pioneering works provide a new opportunity in quantitative, label-free and high-throughout detection of nucleic acid analysis. however, a high fluorescent background because of incomplete quenching of the molecular beacons greatly decreases the signal-to-background ratio. the structure of this unique TaqMan probe consists of an amino group at the 3\u2032 end for immobilization, poly(T)20 as a linker arm, 6-FAM-labeled phosphoramidite at the middle as the reporter dye and a dabcyl group at 5\u2032 end as the quencher. the cleavage occurs on the array and causes an increase in reporter fluorescence intensity because the reporter is no longer quenched. 3\u2032-Amino-modified TaqMan probes and other oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized and purified with double reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. the probes were synthesized and purified with double reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography by the department of chemistry. the laser moves from point to point to produce the scanned images at medium speed and in unidirectional scan mode. the slide is imaged with a zoom factor of 1 and the image size of the scanning field area is 1 mm 1 mm. adjust the gain and offset of PMT1 until the image is bright enough. the slides were washed thoroughly in 0.1% Tween, rinsed in distilled water and dried by a flow of nitrogen gas. the probe array can be used for immediately 5\u2032 nuclease PCR assays on a solid surface or stored at 4\u00b0C for future use. the microscope glass slides were put into the 16 16 twin tower block thermocycler. thermocycling was carried out as follows: an initial 2 min at 50\u00b0C for optimal UNG enzyme, and 10 min denaturation at 95\u00b0C. a 193 base oligomer of the hexon gene fragment was designed to be complementary to the 3\u2032 amino-modified TaqMan probe TM2. enylmethoxycarbonyl protected 3\u2032-amino-modifier C7 CPG was used as the solid support for synthesis. the probes were synthesized with UltraMild CE phosphoramidites. the probes were cleaved from the CPG with 50 mM K2CO3 in anhydrous MeOH. images were analyzed by ImageJ version 1.3 (NIH) the slides were cleaned with deionized distilled water and incubated in 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH = 7.4) for 2 h. the slides were thoroughly washed twice with methanol, acetone and deionized distilled water. the TaqMan probe array can be used for immediately 5\u2032 nuclease PCR assays on a solid surface or stored at 4\u00b0C for future use. the PCRs were performed in a total volume of 25 l containing 1 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. the amplification condition consists of an initial 2 min at 50\u00b0C for optimizing the UNG enzyme. a 193 base oligomer of the hexon gene fragment was designed to be complementary to the 3\u2032 amino-modified TaqMan probe TM2. this was obtained via gene synthesis method (20) service provided by Shanghai Sangon Co., China. the instrument, reaction condition and the acquisition of fluorescence images are identical to those described above. a surface immobilized TaqMan probe was designed and synthesized with an amino group at the 3\u2032 end, fluorescein-dT at the middle as the reporter dye and Dybcyl at the 5\u2032 end as a quencher. a CPG with Fmoc protected amino group and UltraMild CE phosphoramidites were used for synthesis. a 20 base T was used as a linker to minimize space hindrance for enzyme clea the laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP) obtained the scanned images at stable speed. the image size of the scanning field area is 1 mm 1 mm. the physical distance between the two dyes in solution is crucial. primers and TaqMan probes used in this study CovF 5\u2032-AAATGAATTACCAAGTCAATGG-3\u2032 CovR 5\u2032-TACCCACAGCATCTCTAGT-3\u2032 EF
