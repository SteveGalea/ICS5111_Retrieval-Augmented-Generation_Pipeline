{"summary": "most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. but the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins. this new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance. cytomegalovirus is a DNA virus of the herpesviridae family. cyclosporin A can be used as an immunosuppressive drug in organ transplantation and as an anti-CMV agent. the high risk of infection in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients is associated with serostatus of the donor and recipient, type of transplanted organ, host immune status, and viral factors. in pregnant women, among factors that increase the risk of CMV infections are socioeconomic status, parasitic infections, CMV viral load and serostatus. vertical transmissions mostly occur in the third trimester, and fetuses are mostly born healthy. there seems to be no difference in symptoms among babies born of pregnancies affected with primary and non-primary CMV infections. mortality is between 20 and 30% in symptomatic congenital infections. virus can establish latent infections in myeloid cells that eventually infiltrate the brain and develop into microglia cells. CMV induces injuries by interfering with cell differentiation, morphogenesis and survival, controlling apoptosis mechanism, infecting neural stem cell and interfering with brain developmental process. 117,118 Cyclophilin A (CyPA), which can bind cyclosporin A (CsA), was first isolated from bovine thymocytes. 115,119 CyPA resembles the high abundance CyPs in eukaryotic cells119. CyPA maintains the integrity and function of BBB. in brain injuries, CyPA induces endothelial cell proliferation and migration as well as recruiting monocytes for the repair of brain blood vessels. 159,162,163 CsA also affects the expression of AP-1 and NF-B. 164\u2013166 modulates the antigen-specific immune and Ca2+-independent responses. causes abnormal glomerular filtration, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatoxicity, and cardiovascular disorders. calcineurin controls JNK while in complex with PKC-u.191\u2013193 CsA derivatives. alisporivir (Debio-025) was synthesized to contain sarcosine instead of d-methylalanine at position 3 of the PPIase domain. methyl-leucine instead of ethylvaline at position 4 of the calcineurin domain. 196,199 This CsA derivative inhibits HCV infection201 without detectable inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. treatment with this drug is associated with transient increases in interferon, 1, and 3, the cytokines responsible for the clearance of the viruses. alisporivir still results in side effects including reversible hyperbilirubinemia and pancreatitis when used in combination with PEG-IFNa2a and ribavirin to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. CyPA and viral diseases CyPA is an essential protein for the HCV and hepatitis B virus replications. interactions between CyPA with NS5A and NS5B stimulate viral genome replication. inhibition of virus replication by CsA and its non-immunosuppressive derivatives involves both the CyPA-dependent and independent pathways.241,242 The inhibition of virus replication can also be achieved with the non-immunosuppressive analogs of CsA such as SCY-635. CyPA and CMV replication Cell signals and CMV cellular entry and replication involve several factors including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), integrin 1 and 2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor- (PDGFR)271\u2013273 Binding to these receptors initiates Ca+2 homeostasis, activation of phospholipase C and A2, the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites. repression occurs through factors including those involved in post-translational modification of histones299,300 and TNF.301,302 In HCMV-permissive cells, MIEP associate with acetylated histone H4. HCMV remains latent in monocytes that serve as carriers for the virus. HCMV IE1-72 and IE2-86 bind to p53, although only HCMV IE2-86 can block its function. both HCMV IE1-72 and IE2-86 stimulate the anti-apoptotic PI3-K/Akt signalling pathway and delay the onset of p53 activity. the virus uses these cytokines to activate CXCR1 and CXCR2, and preferentially attract neutrophils that can serve as virus carriers. 330,331 HCMV genome contains the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), UL33, UL78, US27, and US28.333\u2013336 The GPCRs prevents leukocytes from recognizing HCMV-infected cells. 159,160 Most of the cellular pathways mediated by CyPA are sensitive to CsA. they are fully controlled by CMV during viral infection and replication. 133,370 that CD147 operates as a legend for CyPA. the interaction was established between CMV and ectodomain of CD147.373 When CMV enters the cell, it stimulates CyPA production that interacts with CD147 to mediate virus replication and early immune response. the CD147\u2013CyPA activates NFB through ERK1/2 pathway. expression.372 CsA can affect IE1 expression and CyPA activity but not CyPA expression.372 CsA as CyPA target drug inhibited the CyPA-mediated P38/MAPK pathway. the antioxidant compound can also control and limit virus replication. the IE2 expression will eventually decline, allowing for the inhibition of CyPA by CsA. no late (L) gene encoding structural protein will be expressed. this leads to the blockage of virus replication and production of virus progeny. the virus activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, also known as MAPK, through the ERK/MEK1/2 pathway. the NF-B specific promoter 1 protein (Sp1) can be activated by HCMV IE1-72 and IE2-86 either independently or synergically. infected cells are arrested at the G1 phase310,311 of the cell cycle. both HCMV IE1-72 and IE2-86 can transactivate p53 promoter and induce p53 accumulation. however, HCMV IE1-72 represses p53 transactivation activity. UL36, a viral inhibitor of caspase-8-induced apoptosis (vICA) and UL37 gene encoding viral mitochondria-localized inhibitors of apoptosis (vMIA) affect permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, preventing the release of cytochrome c necessary for the activation of the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 pathway. HCMV inhibits production of IFN by blocking the IFN-stimulated responses and disrupting the IFN signal transduction pathway. the HCMV inhibits NF-B signaling responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, CCL5, and TNF. CsA is a common immunosuppressive drug used during organ transplantations and mediates HCMV reactivation in vivo. this response may result from overall immunosuppression. gene ISG15, NFB, IL-6, and TNF-induced above inhibit immune response mediated by CD147.374 This inhibition is also mediated by CsA as it blocks CyPA function. many viruses successfully replicate by inducing oxidative stress. IE1 and IE2 also play a role in controlling gene activation factor to mediate viral replication and its response to CsA as an antiviral drug. the virus also binds to v3 integrin, another receptor that mediates actin depolymerization, facilitating virus translocation to the nucleus,281. the NF-B specific promoter 1 protein (Sp1) can be activated by HCMV IE1-72 and IE2-86 either independently or synergistically. the cell transcription factor stimulates or represses transcription of NF-B, CREB/ATF, AP1,292 Ying Yang1 (YY1), and Ets-2 repressor factors (ERF) the virus also responds to alterations in cell growth and activation of host genes by interacting with histone deacetylases and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins via the LxCxE-dependent pathway. the binding of Rb protein to the E2F transcription factor partially controls cell growth in the HCMV-infected cells and other pocket proteins, such as p107. egument protein contains the UL146 and UL147 genes encoding for the CXC chemokines, vCXCL1 and vCXCL2. the virus uses these cytokines to activate CXCR1 and CXCR2 and preferentially attract neutrophils. Cyclosporin A, CyPA, and CMV CsA is an immunosuppressive agent22,352 that can potentiate CMV infection. 159,160 Most of the cellular pathways mediated by CyPA are fully controlled by CsA during viral infection and replication. the other immune response to CMV is carried out by toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) stimulated by glycoproteins364 and CD147.369. the other immune response to CMV is carried out by toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) stimulated by glycoproteins364. the p38/MAPK pathway is necessary to activate the NFB transcription factor Elk-1, Sap-1, ATF-2, CREB, CHOP, and Max. IE1 and IE2 also play a role in controlling gene activation factor to mediate viral replication. the ability of IE2 to overcome CsA inhibition by CyPA can stimulate viral gene expressions. chemokine-like receptor proteins, US3 and US6, interact with HL-AC and HL-AG and affect the expression of MHC class 1 antigen. IE2 expression will eventually decline, allowing for the inhibition of CyPA by CsA through the formation of the CsA\u2013CyPA complex. the IE2 protein is encoded by the CMV IE gene UL122. IE2 expression depends on which proteins or cellular signals it interacts with during the cascade of events. the inhibitory effect of CsA is most effective in early stages of the viral replication cycle. the authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. the authors are grateful to Taiz University and Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific research (MoHESR), Yemen for the financial support of Ashwaq\u2019s scholarship."}
