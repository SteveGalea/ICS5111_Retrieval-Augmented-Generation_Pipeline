{"summary": "the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI H5N1) has emerged and spread broadly in the past decade. a vaccine based on the current strain of H5N1 may not be effective in the case of a future pandemic. new and better antiviral therapies are needed as alternatives for when drug resistance emerges. the development of siRNA delivery systems would further enhance the potential utility of siRNAs for prophylaxis and therapy of human influenza virus infections. the use of antibodies as targeting agents to direct the delivery of siRNA-liposomes to particular cells represents a promising method for enhancing the efficiency and specificity of siRNA delivery. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) the sequences of siRNA targeting NP mRNA of influenza virus, green fluorescent protein (GFP) siRNA were the following: 1496NP siRNAs (sense, 5\u2032-GGAUUUUUUUCGG huscFv was derived from a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody against HA of H5N1 influenza virus. the mouse scFv gene was synthesized using a VH-linker-VL format. a cysteine residue was added to the C terminus of scFv to facilitate the site-directed coupling to liposomes. the huscFv had a cysteine residue at the C terminus was first reduced using 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) after mixing by rotation at room temperature for 30 min, DTT was removed by dialysis against PBS buffer. the unconjugated huscFv was removed by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 g for 30 min. liposome was calculated based on a formula described previously (17). lyophilization/rehydration method was used to entrap siRNA specific to virus NP mRNA (1496NP siRNA) to the immunoliposomes, as well as to the nontargeted liposomes. FITC-1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes or FITC-1496NP siRNA-liposomes (0.5 M siRNA) were treated with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Axiovert 200M LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss, Germany) the cells were further analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) the cells were seeded into 24-well plates (6 104 cells per well) and then incubated overnight. the cells were transfected with siRNA-immunoliposomes, siRNA-liposomes, or naked siRNA for 48 h. at 48 h after infection, cell growth and viability were determined by adding 0.4% trypan blue to PBS. the presence of viral NP was detected in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for the influenza virus NP. the plates were washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and the anti-NP antibody was then added to each well. wells with an absorbance reading higher than 2 times the mean absorbance of only MDCK cells were scored as positive for viral replication. PCRs were performed within the linear range of amplification for each amplicon (30 cycles for NP and 35 cycles for GAPDH) the primer sequences were as follows: for NP (252 bp), forward, 5\u2032-GGTTCTACATACAGATGTGCAC-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-CTGTTTTTGTC-3\u2032. images were captured with a G:Box Chemi XR5 apparatus (Syngene) the sequences of siRNA targeting NP mRNA of influenza virus, green fluorescent protein (GFP) siRNA were the following: 1496NP siRNAs (sense, 5\u2032-GGAUUUUUUUCGGAGdTdT-3\u2032; antisense, 5\u2032-CUCCGAAGAAAUAAAGAUCCdT-3\u2032), 949 GFP siRNA (sense, 5\u2032-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCAUU-3\u2032; antisense, huscFv was derived from a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody against HA of H5N1 influenza virus. the mouse scFv gene was synthesized using a VH-linker-VL format. a cysteine residue was added to the C terminus of scFv to facilitate the site-directed coupling to liposomes. the huscFv had a cysteine residue at the C terminus was first reduced using 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) the mixture was then mixed with the nontargeted liposomes at a huscFv/Mal-PEG\u2013DSPE molar ratio of 1:20. the pellet was then incubated for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere. a lyophilization/rehydration method was used to entrap siRNA specific to virus NP mRNA (1496NP siRNA) to the immunoliposomes. the immunoliposomes were rehydrated with a specific amount of diluted siRNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, at a weight ratio for DC-Chol:siRNA of 60:1, to obtain a 70% encapsulation efficiency. cells were visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope. FITC-1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes or FITC-1496NP siRNA-liposomes (0.5 M siRNA) for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. the percentage of viable MDCK cells after incubation with siRNA-immunoliposomes was determined via trypan blue exclusion staining (20). the cells were seeded into 24-well plates (6 104 cells per well) and then incubated overnight. the cells were transfected with siRNA-immunoliposomes, siRNA-liposomes, or naked siRNA for 48 h. the presence of viral NP was detected in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the plates were washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. the anti-NP antibody was then added to each well. wells with an absorbance reading higher than 2 times the mean absorbance of only MDCK cells were scored as positive for viral replication. PCRs were performed within the linear range of amplification for each amplicon (30 cycles for NP and 35 cycles for GAPDH) the primer sequences were as follows: for NP (252 bp), forward, 5\u2032-GGTTCTACATACAGATGTGCAC-3\u2032; for GAPDH (496 bp), forward, 5\u2032-CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3 immunoliposomes exhibited a size increase of approximately 10 nm after lyophilization and rehydration with PBS buffer. the immunoliposomes showed a size increase to approximately 266 nm and had a slightly net positive surface charge of +6.28 mV. HA-expressing Sf9 cells were incubated with either rhodamine B-labeled immunoliposomes or nontargeted liposomes at 4\u00b0C to prevent cellular uptake. the cells were then analysed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. the red fluorescence was diffusely distributed over the entire surface of the HA-expressing Sf9 cells after treatment with immunoliposomes. huscFv reduced the siRNA transfection level to the level observed in control Sf9 cells incubated with siRNA-immunoliposomes. huscFv mediated target-specific binding and increased siRNA delivery into HA-positive target cells. no significant effect on cell viability was observed after incubating MDCK cells with various concentrations of siRNA-immunoliposomes. the 1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes were transfected into MDCK cells. at 24 and 48 h postinfection, culture supernatants were harvested to determine the viral titers. the cell pellets were used for determination of the viral NP mRNA transcription levels. siRNA delivery was achieved either before or after the viral infection. transfection by 1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes at 6 or 12 h after infection significantly reduced the viral titer compared to that with the 1496NP siRNA-liposomes delivery method (P 0.05) huscFv improved the potency of siRNA delivery by directing internalization of siRNA into the virus-infected cells. the cells were incubated with soluble huscFv, 1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes, or free 1496NP siRNA. free huscFv, at a concentration equivalent to the amount present on immunoliposomes, had no effect on the viral titers in H5N1-infected cells. the transfection with 1496NP siRNA-immunoliposomes was most effective. RT-PCR was used to detect the NP mRNA transcripts of infected MDCK cells. the RT-PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel. the data are presented as means SD from three independent experiments. the siRNA-immunoliposomes were used, compared to siRNA-liposome results. NP mRNA sequences of 1496NP siRNA guide strand 3\u2032-dTdTCCUAGAAAAGAAGCCUC-5\u2032a H5N1 virus isolates obtained from the GenBank database. the 1496NP siRNA guide strand contains a single mismatch (underlined) at position 15 (G:U) of the target site. a single mismatch between the 1496NP siRNA and NP mRNA resulted in the reduction of the siRNA efficiency. the siRNA-immunoliposomes reduced the viral titer 2- to 4-fold better than siRNA-liposomes. the siRNA-immunoliposomes reduced the viral titer 2- to 4-fold better than siRNA-liposomes.

MDCK cells were transfected with either siRNA-immunoliposomes or siRNA-liposomes (0.5 M siRNA) at the indicated time points both before and after VSMU-5 infection. the data are presented as means SD from three independent experiments. osomes (P 0.05) and 1,000-fold lower than transfection with free 1496NP siRNA. huscFv significantly enhanced the anti-H5N1 activity of the 1496NP siRNA against viral replication. VSMU-3 has a polymorphism of nucleotides at position 1510, with thymine (T) instead of cytosine (C) the 1496NP siRNA was still effective in reducing the virus titer in MDCK cells infected with the H5N1 single-mismatch strain.
