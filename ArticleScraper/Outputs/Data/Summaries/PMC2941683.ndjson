{"summary": "155 adult patients with confirmed infection of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in 23 hospitals in china from October 1 to December 23, 2009. the most common organ dysfunctions included acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, septic shock, and acute renal failure. corticosteroids use was associated with a trend toward higher hospital mortality. 155 adult hospitalized patients with confirmed infection of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in china from October 1 to December 23, 2009. a variable proportion of patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection were hospitalized [5], or both adult and pediatric patients [7,8], or all cases with confirmed, suspected, and probable diagnoses [8-10]. the heterogeneous patient population in the above studies might preclude the possibility of reporting valid risk factors for mortality. e-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay performed at a laboratory operated under the auspices of the Chinese CDC. all reviewers were trained during a 1.5-hour course before the study. data were recorded: sex, age, major diagnosis, comorbidities, clinical presentation at symptom onset and on hospital admission, major laboratory results on hospital admission, complications, antiviral and antibiotic treatment, supportive treatment, and outcome. two separate models were constructed using stepwise conditional forward entry. one for demography, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and laboratory tests on admission. one for complications including organ failures and infections, if p 0.1. value Male sex 73 (57.0%) 17 (63.0%) 90 (58.1%) 0.570 Age, year 42.4 18.2 45.9 20.7 43.0 18.6 0.388 Ethnicity Han Chinese 127 (99.2%) 25 (92.6%) 152 (98.1%) 0.079 Smoker 28 (21.9%) 7 (25.9%) 35 (22.6%) 0.647 No comorbidity 60 (46.9%) 14 (51.9%) 74 (47.7%) 0.609 Com rhea 21 (16.4%) 3 (11.1%) 24 (15.5%) 0.770 Hemoptysis 15 (11.7%) 4 (14.8%) 19 (12.3%) 0.746 Diarrhea 6 (4.7%) 1 (3.7%) 7 (4.5%) 1.000 Vomiting 5 (3.9%) 0 5 (3.2%) 0.588 Time from symptoms to hospital admission, day* 5.0 (3.0, 7.0) 6.0 (3.5, 7.0) 5.0 (3.0, 7.0) aspartate transaminase, CK-MB, creatine kinase-MB; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CPK, creatine phosphokinase; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; CXR, chest-X ray. most common presenting symptom was fever (> 37.8\u00b0C) followed by cough (91.6%), dyspnea (47.1%), sore throat (29.7%), large-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed in 139 (89.7%) patients as empiric or definitive therapy.
