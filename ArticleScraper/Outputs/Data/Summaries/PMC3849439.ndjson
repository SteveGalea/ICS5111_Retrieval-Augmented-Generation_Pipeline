{"summary": "five analogous overlapping peptides were designed and synthesized based on the putative heptad repeat 2 sequence of the spike protein of FCoV. peptide (FP5) at concentrations below 20 M inhibited viral replication by up to 97%. antiviral drugs have been developed to control SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) peptides, carbohydrate-binding agents, cathepsin inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, nitric oxide, siRNA and interferons. all the above-mentioned drugs have been tested for their ability to inhibit FCoV replication. the combination of nelfinavir and galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) has a synergistic antiviral effect that inhibits FCoV replication. peptides based on the putative HR2 of the S protein were designed and tested for their inhibitory effect. 104 cells/mL were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. the cells were then pre-incubated with or without different concentrations of peptides. the cells in each well were incubated with MTT reagent (10 mg/mL) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. the supernatants were collected 48 h postinfection and incubated with fcwf-4 cells. after 1 h of incubation, the supernatants were removed, and DMEM containing 2% FBS was added. the cells were fixed and stained at 72 h postinfection. fcwf-4 cells (3 104 cells/mL) were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. the cells were then pre-incubated with or without different concentrations of peptides. the cells were then incubated with or without different concentrations of peptides in triplicate at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. the amino acid sequences of peptides (FP1-FP5) in HR2 are shown. ss, signal sequence. TM, transmembrane domain. CY, cytoplasmic tail. the numbers of amino acid residues are indicated. the supernatants were removed after 1 h of incubation for titration. the viral titer in the presence of each combination of peptide/IFN- was determined using a plaque reduction assay. FP5 was the most potent inhibitor of FCoV replication among the tested peptides. the data are the meansstandard errors of triplicate wells. one representative experiment of more than two experiments is shown. a complete inhibitory effect was observed, and viral titer reduced by up to 4.08 LogPFU/ml. these combinations showed synergetic effects, as determined by a two-way analysis of variance. a representative experiment of more than two experiments is shown. the IC50 values of FP4 and FP5 were 1.8 M and 1.33 M respectively. FP5 was the most potent inhibitor of FCoV replication among the tested peptides. the data are the meansstandard errors of triplicate wells. a complete inhibitory effect was observed when 20 M FP5 was combined with 10 to 1000 IU of IFN- and when 10 M FP5 was combined with 1000 IU of IFN-, a complete inhibitory effect was observed. this inhibitory effect is higher than the additive effect mediated by the two agents alone. the inhibitory efficacy is not correlated with the lengths of these reported HR2 peptides. the central helix region of HR2 containing amino acid residue 1161 to 1175 are critical to inhibit SARS-CoV infection. truncation of N-terminal was found to be more related to the loss of potency than the C-terminal. the treatment of this disease also requires IFN, immune inhibitors, or cytokine antagonists to achieve a better prognosis. this study used in vitro experiments to demonstrate that an HR peptide can inhibit FCoV replication."}
