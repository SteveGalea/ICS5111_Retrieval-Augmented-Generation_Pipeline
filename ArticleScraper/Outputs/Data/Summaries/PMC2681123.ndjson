{"summary": "a quantified CHIKV in vitro RNA transcript was used as a positive control. a quantified RNA transcript containing 9 1010 subgenomic RNA copies/L was used as a noninfectious positive control. additional measures were taken to provide proper primers and probes because these components are most vulnerable to variation when assays are adapted from protocols. participants were asked to test the material with any molecular assay routinely used for detecting CHIKV in human plasma or with the preformulated test. a total of 36 sets of results were received by the study coordinator, including 3 double sets from 3 laboratories that used 2 methods each. samples containing 10,487,171 RNA copies/mL were correctly detected by all participating laboratories. only 22.6% correctly detected the sample with 1,076 copies/mL. seventeen laboratories missed the proficiency criteria because of a lack of sensitivity. 1,288 RNA copies/mL (95% CI 416\u20132,344) data fit into the model with p0.00001. to evaluate critical criteria in laboratory practice. we evaluated automated versus manual RNA extraction methods. commercial firms did not rapidly prioritize development of CHIKV test kits. ENIVD attempted to assist implementation of molecular diagnostics on an ad hoc basis."}
