{"summary": "a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in different regions of the world. we fit the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data. a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R0) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories. this suggests an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. a total of 466,815 suspected and 111,333 confirmed autochthonous transmission cases have been reported in 47 countries/territories in the Americas since 2015. a total of 466,815 suspected and 111,333 confirmed autochthonous transmission cases have been reported in 47 countries/territories in the Americas from Mexico to Argentina. Currently without vaccines or medication for treatment, the global Zika outbreaks have prompted the world health organization to declare for most countries, both confirmed and suspected data are given. for most countries, both confirmed and suspected data are given. we choose to use the confirmed data only. the criterion for a good model fit is that the NLS estimation converges with p-value 0.05. the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimated parameters are positive. if a wave is achieved, we repeat the fitting procedure starting from the endpoint of this wave to attempt to obtain a subsequent wave. the former is the weekly laboratory confirmed case data from April 1 to July 29, 2007 in Yap Island (Duffy et al., 2009), while the latter is that of weekly number of suspected Zika cases in six main archipelagos (Tahiti, Iles sous-le-vent, Moorea, Tuamotu-Gambier, Marquises, and Australes) in French Polynesia. the Richards model is a phenomenological model which describes the growth of the cumulative case number. K, r, and the turning point ti are three model parameters of epidemiological importance. these parameters can be estimated by fitting the Richards model to the epicurve of the outbreak using standard software with nonlinear least-squares approximation subroutines. results We fit the Richards model to time series data of zika cases from 2015 up to week 18 of 2016. only six of these 13 time series data can provide good fit with the Richards model with at least one distinct wave of cases. only Colombia and Guatemala have two waves of cases while all other data only result in one wave. 0.78 (0.49,1.08) 9380 (9286,9473) 7.1 (6.8,7.4) 6.00 (0.06,11.95) 0.999 Colombia 32/2015\u201343/2015 0.25 (0.22,0.27) 619 (571,668) 8.1 (7.6,8.5) 1.75 (1.34,2.16) 0.998 49/2015\u201316/2016 0.26 (0.19,0.32) 6288 (6110,6465) 7.1 (6.4,7.8) 1.79 (1.29,2. we fit the Richards model to the weekly number of suspected Zika cases in the six main archipelagos in French Polynesia. the results of the fittings are given in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Table 2. Summary of parameter mean estimates for weekly Zika case fitting. a downward turning point of 8.1 pinpointed the week of October 11\u201317 in 2015. a downward turning point of 8.1 pinpointed the week of October 11\u201317 in 2015. the model fit for the six island populations in French Polynesia reveals synchronous waves between week 41, 2013 to week 13, 2014. the turning points for the waves vary substantially from week 48 of 2013 in Tahiti (6.5 weeks after week 41) to week 3 of 2014, a range of almost 2 months. this discrepancy indicates that the outbreak had occurred during the same time in all six archipelagos. however, from Fig. 3 it appears that Tahiti might be missing data from early stage of the wave before week 41. the respective wave of reported Zika cases are almost synchronized in time with exactly the same week for a turning point, and with similarly high transmissibility and wide 95% CI ranges. the confirmed case data are typically confirmed either clinically or in laboratory and could underreport true symptomatic cases. the suspected case data often contain cases that cannot be confirmed and thus tend to overstate the true magnitude of outbreaks. ardot, Colombia 2015/10/192016/01/22 1.41 (1.15\u20131.74) San Andres Island, Colombia 2015/09/062016/01/30 4.61 (4.11\u20135.16) Dinh et al.

(2015) demonstrates that using the cumulative data superficially suggests a higher degree of precision in the estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. a potentially overly optimistic estimate of its precision as quantified by the range of its confidence interval. a.
