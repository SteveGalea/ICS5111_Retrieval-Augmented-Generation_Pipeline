{"summary": "RABV is the most prominent member of the Rhabdoviridae family. it is introduced to peripheral muscle tissue through an animal bite. it replicates locally before crossing into the peripheral nervous system via a neuromuscular junction. RABV pathogenicity is unusual among neurotropic viruses. short- and long-term genetic changes in RABV-infected neurons have been characterized but not yet connected to the specific disease phenotype. RABV-specific G antibodies reliably prevent development of rabies after exposure (8). RABV activates type I IFN genes (IFN- class and IFN-) through a RIG-I pathway (1, 17) Ifit1 is an in vivo restriction factor for the positive-stranded RNA viruses WNV (22) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (23) but not the negative-stranded influenza virus (24), La Crosse encephalitis virus, or Ebola virus. Ifit2 is also a restriction factor for several negative-stranded RNA viruses. targeting Ifit2 or a generic control sequence and then 24 h later were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with BNSP-Cre, a Cre recombinase expressing recombinant RABV based on the SAD-B19 rabies vaccine vector (13). data related to live viral load and gene expression represent the averages from three independent experiments. qPCR results and live virus titers represent the outcome of three independent experiments. Ifit2 knockout mice exhibit increased mortality and pathogenicity. mice in wild-type, Ifit1/, Ifit2/, and Ifnar/ B6 mice were included. overall survival was 75% the for wild-type, 50% for the Ifit1/, 25% for the Ifit2/, and 40% for the Ifnar/ groups. overall survival of wild-type, Ifit1/, Ifit2/, and Ifnar/ mice after intranasal infection is shown. mRNAs were detected in uninfected wild-type mice at low quantities. expression of Ifit1 in Ifit2/ mice started from a slightly lower basal level to become upregulated by approximately the same magnitude. this test also confirmed complete elimination of Ifit2 expression in Ifit2/ mice. GFP appeared in olfactory bulbs of wild-type and Ifit2/ mice at the same time point (day 6) but was restricted in wild-type mice from reaching other regions until a later time point than in Ifit2/ mice. overall, spread of RABV appeared to be accelerated in Ifit2/ mice, which displayed patterns roughly corresponding to those of the wild-type mice. interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Ifit2 or a generic control sequence and then 24 h later were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with BNSP-Cre, a Cre recombinase expressing recombinant RABV based on the SAD-B19 rabies vaccine vector (13). siRNA-mediated depletion of Ifit2 in uninfected mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2A) cells results in decreased Ifit2 RNA (A) and protein expression (B) compared to those for the negative control in IFN-treated cells and in infected Neuro2A cells results in increased RABV positive-sense mRNA (C) and increased live RABV load (D) overall survival was 75% the for wild-type, 50% for the Ifit1/, 25% for the Ifit2/, and 40% for the Ifnar/ groups. wild-type and Ifit2/ mice infected with 105 FFU of RABV were sacrificed randomly. s. Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNAs were detected in uninfected wild-type mice at low quantities, becoming upregulated approximately 100-fold and 20- to 30-fold after infection. expression of Ifit1 in Ifit2/ mice started from a slightly lower basal level to become upregulated by approximately the same magnitude. this test also confirmed complete elimination of Ifit2 expression in Ifit2/ mice. run in a separate experiment showed viral spread in more visual detail. GFP appeared first in olfactory bulbs of wild-type and Ifit2/ mice at the same time point (day 6) but was restricted in wild-type mice from reaching other regions until a later time point than in Ifit2/ mice. d disease may depend on the route of administration or the cell type infected (20). we tested the hypothesis that an Ifit2-dependent antiviral effect occurs during RABV infections, despite differences in the biology of RABV and viruses studied before. a block of axonal transport is the least likely of these explanations. a block of intracellular replication is the least likely of these explanations. a block of axonal transport is the least likely of these explanations. in vitro results point toward an intracellular replication block as the Ifit2 anti-RABV mechanism, because all cells in the system are synchronously infected. studies of the closely related protein Ifit1, which is a prominent Ifit2 binding partner, seem to point in this direction as well. Ifit2 requires the participation of other proteins (or other Ifits) to have an effect on RABV infection. BNSP-Cre, which expresses a Cre recombinase transgene, was originally recovered from an infectious clone of RABV. Ifit1/, Ifit2/, and Ifnar/ mice, described previously (29), were crossed with mice expressing the Cre-inducible Tdt/GFP cassette described previously (13), generating lines of mice positive for the Tdt transgene and homozygous knockouts at an Ifit or Ifnar locus. mice were housed under approved IACUC guidelines at laboratory animal facilities of Thomas Jefferson University. the live RABV titer was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pBS) to 10% (wt/vol) and homogenized by hand with a glass column. RNA extraction was carried out on Qiagen RNeasy columns. brain samples marked for sectioning were submerged immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde and left overnight at 4\u00b0C. cryoprotection of samples was carried out by submerging samples sequentially overnight at 4\u00b0C in 10%, 20%, and finally 30% sucrose prior to freezing. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a universal mRNA RT primer (poly-dT21V) qPCR results for each independent experiment represent the averages from assay triplicates. qPCR results for each independent experiment represent the averages from assay triplicates. antigen was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) BNSP-Cre expresses a Cre recombinase transgene inserted between the RABV N and P genes. it was originally recovered from an infectious clone of the SAD-B19 vaccine strain of RABV. titers in brain tissue and infected-cell supernatants were determined. the endpoint criterion for pathogenicity experiments was either observed neurological symptoms (grade 4) or greater than 25% weight loss from the start of the experiment. brains of infected mice were collected for virus isolation, histological analysis, and RNA extraction as described below. the interferon (IFN) used for pretreating cells was mouse IFN- (575302; BioLegend) at a concentration of 1,000 U/ml. siRNA and IFN were added to cells simultaneously and at 24 h prior in infection with RABV. RNA extraction was carried out on Qiagen RNeasy columns. feron beta (IFN-) and RPL13a were quantified using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (204145; Qiagen) the sequences of the forward primer, reverse primer, and TaqMan probe were as follows, 5\u2032 to 3\u2032. in vitro transcription was carried out with the MAXIscript T3/T7 kit (AM1326; Thermo Fisher) qPCR results were run in qPCR parallel to experimental samples. levels of IFN- and RPL13 were quantitated relatively using the CT method."}
