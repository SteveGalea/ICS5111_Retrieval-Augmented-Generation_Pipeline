{"summary": "subunit vaccines are a cost-effective and powerful weapon against human and animal infectious diseases. many diseases have been neutralized, but potential vaccine-preventable diseases continue to threaten human and animal health. the orientation of antigen epitopes is critical for activation of B cells. the orientation of antigen epitopes is critical for activation of B cells. an ideal immunogen should have multiple copies of epitopes, and bind to multiple BCRs. the decoy epitope, an immunodominant region consisting of residues 169\u2013180 (Cap) exposed on the surface of the Cap protein monomer, allows PCV2 to evade humoral immunity by inducing low-level NA and high-level non-protection antibodies. the effectiveness of cellular uptake of Cap-AuNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells and DC2.4 dendritic cells and subsequent cytokine secretion were measured. our study lays the foundation for the development of a human and animal subunit vaccine based on antigen structural analysis. oligopeptide 169-STIDYFQPNNKR was synthesized by GL Biochem. a cysteine was added to the N-terminal end of the oligopep-tide. then conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. pUC57 vector was synthesized by Sangon Company (Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China) the coding sequence of Cap protein was amplified. the PCR product and PET28a vector were doubly digested with BamHI and HindIII (NEB), treated with T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) the stability of the conjugate was assessed by adding 10% sodium chloride. the conjugates were confirmed by UV-Vis, DLS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the quantification of Cap-AuNPs was measured as follows. the OD value of each well was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. the uptake of Cap-AuNPs by antigen-presenting cells was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. the cells were seeded at 5104 cells/well on 96-well cell culture plate. one hundred L of AuNPs (10 g/mL), Cap (1.2 g/mL), or Cap-AuNPs (11.2 g/mL) was added to incubate. each mouse was subcutaneously immunized with 100 L of the indicated vaccines. Cap-AuNPs were lyophilized and stored for 3 months at 4\u00b0C. before immunization, Cap-AuNP powder was resuspended in water and CpG was added. each group received an identical booster immunization 3 weeks after primary immunization. titers of PCV2 neutralizing antibody (NA) in sera were determined by the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. after incubation, the mixtures were added to 96-well plates containing 20% confluent PK15 cells. splenocytes were seeded into 96-well plates at 100 L per well. resuspended at 5105 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 complete medium containing 10% FBS. cells were stimulated with 100 L complete medium containing Cap protein (20 g/mL) milli-Q water with a resistance of 18.2 M was used in all experiments. fully cytosine-phosphate-guanine-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) 1826 with a sequence of 5\u2032-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3\u2032 were synthesized and purified. auNPs were synthesized by the Turkevich\u2019s method of reduction of HAuCl43H2O with Na3C6H5O72H2O. 1 mL of 1% HAuCl4 (10 mg/mL) was added to 100 mL ddw and brought to boiling. then water was added to bring the nanoparticle solution to a volume of 100 mL. isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. the concentration was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. the supernatant was collected and the concentration of Cap was measured. the spatial structure of Cap conjugated to AuNPs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Cap or Cap-AuNPs were diluted 10-fold by DMEM. 100 L of Cap protein (1.2 g/mL) or Cap-AuNPs (11.2 g/mL) containing the same amount of Cap protein was added to incubate with the cells. after incubation, the cells were fixed in precooled methanol for 10 min at room temperature. one hundred L of AuNPs (10 g/mL), Cap (1.2 g/mL), or Cap-AuNPs (11.2 g/mL) was added to incubate with the cells. cytokine concentration of IL-1, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF- was measured. each group received an identical booster immunization 3 weeks after primary immunization. sera were harvested at 0, 21, and 42 days post immunization. all efforts were made to alleviate and minimize animal suffering. sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and serially diluted at 2-fold. the mixtures were added to 96-well plates containing 20% confluent PK15 cells. after incubation, the cells were fixed for 30 min with cold ethanol at 20\u00b0C. the stimulation index (SI) was calculated using the following formula: SI = (the mean of OD450 nm values of Cap-stimulated wells) cells were prepared and stimulated as already described. after incubation for 60 h, the culture supernatants were collected to determine the amounts of IL-4, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- using ELISA kits (R&D Systems) as already described. extract of BL21 cells transformed with pET28a-Cap plasmid induced by IPTG. pET28a-Cap protein was stained with silver nitrate. Cap-AuNPs aggregated when they were lyophilized and resuspended. zeta potential had a positive shift from 47.9 mV to 34.7 mV. the FTIR spectrum showed a weak peak near 2,550 cm1 region. ELISA results showed that Cap-AuNPs were more easily recognized by 9F4 and 6A5 than Cap; on the contrary, Cap was more easily recognized by anti-His-tag mAb and 8A10 than Cap-AuNPs. the neutralizing epitopes located on the outer surface were exposed when Cap protein was conjugated to AuNPs via the Au-S bond. the number of AuNPs was calculated under the assumption that all gold chloride trihydrate reacted completely and that all resulting nanoparticles were of uniform size. the surface area of Cap-AuNP conjugates was about 6-fold to PCV2. the mean diameter of Cap-AuNPs is 42 nm. compared to the Cap protein group, the Cap protein group had higher fluorescence intensity. more Cap protein was internalized when Cap protein was adsorbed on AuNPs. IL-12, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-18 secretion from inflammatory-related cytokines. IL-12 and TNF- play pivotal roles in eliciting innate immune responses. the concentration of IL-1 and IL-18 were low indicating no inflammasomes were produced after uptake of AuNPs by RAW264.7 cells. AuNPs did not selectively enhance antibodies against certain epitopes. however, enhancing phagocytosis by APCs is not the underlying reason for AuNPs in enhancing NA levels. antibodies level induced by Cap-AuNPs with or without three adjuvants at 42 dpi. cap-specific IgG level, serum samples of mice diluted at 1:50. CpG weakly promoted levels of anti-Cap and PCV2 IgG. however, AuNPs played a key role rather than CpG. similar results have been found by Tao et al.36. AuNPs significantly enhanced NA, rather than Cap-specific antibodies. these data indicated that AuNPs promoted NA mainly due to reasonable display of neutralizing epitopes and masking of the immunodominant epitope. Cap-AuNPs induced significantly higher SI than Cap or AuNPs. IL-4 and IL-10 are the archetypal Th2 cellular immune response cytokines that improve the production of IgG1. Cap-AuNPs resulted in markedly higher level of IFN- than either the Cap or AuNPs. we speculate that the increase in IFN- secretion may be due to the initial interaction of AuNPs with NK cells after AuNPs were injected into mice. AuNPs had an absorption maximum of 522 nm (Figure 2B and E) original AuNPs had an absorption maximum of 522 nm (Figure 2B and E) the mean diameter of AuNPs was 23.2 nm (23 nm) the FTIR spectrum showed a weak peak near 2,550 cm1 region. the peak disappeared when AuNPs were coated with Cap protein. this coincides with that of Aryal et al, who discovered the absence of S-H representative peak. Binding of 9F4 mAb directed to neutralizing epitope on outer surface of Cap protein was measured by ELISA. Binding of anti-His mAb directed to the inner surface of Cap protein was measured by ELISA. AuNPs was calculated under the assumption that all gold chloride trihydrate reacted completely and that all resulting nanoparticles were of uniform size. we estimated that 358 molecules of Cap protein were conjugated on each AuNP. this is approximately six times the amount of Cap protein on PCV2 (60). the uptake of Cap-AuNPs by DC2.4 and RAW264.7 cells in culture for 1 h. images from left to right show DAPI fluorescence (blue, 200), FITC fluorescence (green, 200), merged panel of the two images (400) the % of Cap that was internalized was determined (n=3 per group) IL-12 and TNF- play pivotal roles in eliciting innate immune responses. IL-12 and TNF- play pivotal roles in eliciting innate immune responses. auNPs did not selectively enhance antibodies against certain epitopes. AuNPs significantly increased the Cap-specific antibody levels in the no-adjuvant and CpG groups. there was almost no effect in the Carbopol and Freund\u2019s adjuvant groups. auNPs significantly improved the PCV2-specific antibody levels. antibodies against PCV2 were part of the antibody against Cap protein. the candidate vaccine used in animal experiments contained large amounts of uncoupled Cap protein (99.4%) high levels of anti-Cap antibodies is the result of host recognition of Cap protein monomer or fragments produced during virus replication. Cap protein is attached to AuNPs via an Au-S bond, thus masking some epitopes. the ratio of IgG against Cap (169\u2013180)/IgG against PCV2 was significantly reduced. PCV2-specific and NA levels in lyophilized group were markedly higher than in non-lyophilized group. the ratio of IgG against Cap (169\u2013180)/IgG against PCV2 in lyophilized group was obviously lower than in non-lyophilized group. the significant difference was compared between group Cap and group Cap-AuNPs. IL-4 and IL-10 are the archetypal Th2 cellular immune response cytokines that improve the production of IgG1. the mechanism that AuNPs improved the NA level of PCV2 subunit vaccine can be attributed to two aspects: first, although Cap protein bound to AuNPs at a very low percentage (0.6%) of total immunized protein, this part of binding protein was efficiently taken up by APCs. each AuNP was capable of displaying 6-fold the amount of Cap protein than PCV2, resulting in a higher degree of BCR cross-linking. a protein carrier is immunogenic, which is disadvantageous for the development of similar vaccines. the basic principle of designing such nanovaccines is to efficiently orient and repetitively display the neutralizing epitopes. if possible, naturally occurring sites can be utilized, such as the unique thiol groups. this takes into account that most neutralizing epitopes are formed from residues that are discontinuous in the primary amino acid sequence or buried by other residues. the introduction of structural-based antigen design methods combined with nanoparticles will contribute to the development of subunit vaccines. orientationally displaying antigen epitopes appears to be feasible."}
