{"summary": "the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in several target organs. this system is activated by the conversion of the angiotensinogen to the inactive peptide angiotensin (Ang) I through the renin action. Ang II is cleaved by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) generating Ang II. Ang-(1\u20137) is a biologically active component of the RAS which binds to Mas inducing many beneficial actions, such as vasodilatation, antifibrosis, and antiproliferative effects. ACE2 can form Ang-(1\u20137) less efficiently through hydrolysis of Ang-(1\u20139) with subsequent Ang-(1\u20137) formation [24]. ACEi and ARBs cause substantial increases in plasma Ang-(1\u20137) levels. some effects of ACEi and ARBs can be blocked or attenuated by a Mas antagonist, confirming the role of Ang-(1\u20137) in the actions of these compounds. in this review, we will focus on the recent findings related to the pathophysiology actions of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis. crackower and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that genetic ablation of ACE2 results in severe blood-pressure-independent systolic impairment. disruption of ACE2 was able to accelerate cardiac hypertrophy and shortened the transition period to heart failure in response to pressure overload. pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in Ang-II-infused rats [59, 60]. Ang-(1\u20137) induces an antiarrhythmogenic effect against ischemia/reperfusion injuries in rats [17, 68] and prevents atrial tachycardia and fibrillation in rats and dogs [69, 70] treatment with Ang-(1\u20137) improved coronary perfusion and cardiac function in rats after myocardial infarction [71] and after ischemia/reperfusion injury [72]. cardiomyocytes present slower [Ca2+]i transients accompanied by a lower Ca2+ ATPase expression in the sarcoplasmic reticulum [66, 76]. Ang-(1\u20137) via Mas increases the synthesis of NO through a mechanism involving the activation of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis is present in vascular endothelial cells and modulates its function promoting vasorelaxation [82], reduction of the oxidative stress [83, 84], and antiproliferative effects [85, 86]. ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis is present in vascular endothelial cells. aortic rings, canine [87] and porcine [88] coronary arteries, canine middle cerebral artery, canine middle cerebral artery, porcine piglet pial arterioles [90], feline mesenteric vascular bed [91], rabbit renal afferent arterioles [92] and mesenteric microvessels of normotensive [93] and hypertensive [94] rats. Ang-(1\u20137) inhibits the vasoconstriction induced by Ang II in human internal mammary arteries. ang-(1\u20137) negatively modulates the Ang II receptor-mediated activation of c-Src and its downstream targets ERK1/2 and NAD(P)H oxidase. ACE2 is the major enzyme involved in Ang-(1\u20137) formation. it has also a crucial role in vessels. the effect was attenuated by A-779 [111]. ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary hypertension (PH), fibrosis, and lung cancer. ACE2 activator XNT or ACE2 gene transfer has shown that these strategies induce beneficial pulmonary outcome without changes in systemic blood pressure in rats and mice. rhACE2 is widely expressed in the pulmonary endothelium, vasculature, and pneumocytes. also, rhACE2 inhibited the increase of Ang II and TNF- levels. also, rhACE2 attenuated the arterial hypoxemia and PH. a growing body of studies has focused on the relevance of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis in the pulmonary cancer pathophysiology. overexpression of ACE2 in cultured lung cancer cells and in human lung cancer xenografs inhibited the cell growth and the vascular endothelial growth factor-a expression induced by Ang II. subcutaneous injections of Ang-(1\u20137) were administered in 18 patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. there were no treatment-related deaths. clinical benefits were observed in 27% of the patients. ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis activates the renin-angiotensin system. the figure highlights the renin inhibitors, the Ang-(1\u20137) formulations. ang-(1\u20137) has a short half-life (approximately 10 seconds) since it is rapidly cleaved by peptidases. oral administration of Ang-(1\u20137) significantly attenuates heart function impairment and cardiac remodeling induced by isoproterenol treatment and myocardial infarction in rats. cyclized Ang-(1\u20137) induced relaxation in precontracted aorta rings of rats which was blocked by Ang-(1\u20137) receptor antagonist D-Pro7-Ang-(1\u20137). AVE 0991 mimics the Ang-(1\u20137) effects in several organs such as vessels [140, 141], kidney [101] and heart [142, 143]. AVE 0991 potentiated the acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in conscious normotensive rats. AVE 0991 induced NO release which was blunted by A-779 and not by AT2 or AT1 antagonists. CGEN-856S induced beneficial cardiovascular effects similar to those caused by Ang-(1\u20137). this compound competes with Ang-(1\u20137) for the same bind site in Mas-transfected cells. this was confirmed by the inhibition of the CGEN-856S effects by the Mas antagonist A-779. ACE2 promotes its beneficial effects due to increased Ang-(1\u20137) production with concomitant degradation of Ang II. coadministration of A-779 abolished the protective effects of XNT on PH. however, off-target effects of XNT on these beneficial outcomes cannot be ruled out. oral administration of HPCD/Ang-(1\u20137) significantly increases plasma Ang-(1\u20137) levels and promotes an antithrombotic effect that was blunted in mice [135]. cyclized Ang-(1\u20137) induced a relaxation in precontracted aorta rings of rats which was blocked by the Ang-(1\u20137) receptor antagonist. AVE 0991 potentiated the acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in conscious normotensive rats. this effect was abolished by the two Ang-(1\u20137) receptor antagonists. AVE 0991 protects the heart against cardiac dysfunction and remodeling caused by isoproterenol treatment or by myocardial infarction in rats [142, 143] this compound competes with Ang-(1\u20137) for the same bind site in Mas-transfected cells. this was confirmed by the inhibition of the CGEN-856S effects by the Mas antagonist A-779. this was confirmed by the inhibition of the CGEN-856S effects by the Mas antagonist. the antifibrotic effect of XNT observed in hearts of SHR was associated with increases in cardiac Ang-(1\u20137) expression [48]. there is growing evidence that changes in the novel components of the RAS may take part in the establishment and progression of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases."}
