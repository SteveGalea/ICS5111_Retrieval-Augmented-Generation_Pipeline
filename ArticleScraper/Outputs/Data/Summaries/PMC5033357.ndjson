{"summary": "TNF- is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine playing pivotal roles in both physiological and pathological processes. the primary function of TNF- is to regulate immune cells in inflammation as well as in protective immune responses against a variety of infectious pathogens. a cyclic TNF- epitope peptide (aa 80\u201396) conjugated to KLH elicits a stronger neutralizing antibody response than the linear counterpart. this suggests that stabilizing the conformation of the peptide epitope epitope is a key criterion in the vaccine design. mice were euthanized on a daily-basis for signs of ill health and distress. the mice were inspected for signs of ill health and distress. the mice were euthanized at the end of the experiments. DTNF7, aa 89\u201396 were replaced with TNF- epitope VSRFAISYQEKVNLLSAV (aa 80\u201397) the inter residue distances were calculated in Swiss-Pdb Viewer 4.0.1 based on the X-ray crystal structures of mouse TNF- and diphtheria Toxin. DD stands for the interatomic distance between end residues of the replaced segment. immunoogenicity of DTNF proteins 50 g of purified DTNF proteins mixed with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (InvivoGen) were injected into female BALB/c mice (6\u20137 weeks old) intradermally followed by three boost injections with 30 g, 20 g, 20 g proteins plus aluminum hydroxide adjuvant on day14, 28, 42. mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation according to IACUC. mice were injected intradermally with 50 g DTNF7 formulated with alum. mice were boosted with 25 g immunogen formulated with alum. Statistical analysis The means SEM or means SE were calculated in Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) from three to ten replicates. *P 0.05,**P 0.01, or ***P 0.001 was considered significant. mice were purchased from SLAC Laboratory Animal Centre. proteins denoted as DTNF proteins were named DTNF1 to DTNF7. amino acid residues corresponding to DTT aa 95\u201396, aa 94\u201396, aa 93\u201396, aa 92\u201396, aa 91\u201396, aa 90\u201396 were replaced with TNF- epitope VSRFAISYQEKVNLLSA (aa 80\u201396), respectively. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS and sonicated. the supernatant was applied to GST-column (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. the tertiary structure of DTNF proteins were modeled in Modeller9V7 based on the X-ray crystal structure of DT and the mouse TNF- mentioned above. the protein structures were visualized using pyMOL 0.99 software. protection of collagen-induced arthritis CIA was induced. hematoxylin-eosin staining and Safranin O staining were diluted 4-fold. the concentration of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IFN-, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF-) were measured using Luminex multiplex technology (Bio-Rad Laboratories). nf. the neutralizing epitope-containing peptide was green colored. the position of conformational perturbation in DTNF2, 5, 6 is colored in yellow. DTNF4 is colored in blue. a combination of universal Th epitopes promises more population coverage. aa 69\u201388, 119\u2013138, 129\u2013148, 149\u2013168, corresponding to DT aa 271\u2013290, 321\u2013340, 331\u2013350, and 351\u2013370. DTNF7 is generated by replacing DTT 89\u201396 with. DTNF proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. all of them are highly soluble at the concentration greater than 10 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4, 25\u00b0C. DTNF7 elicited most robust antibody response against mouse and human TNF-. samples were diluted 1:100. data are presented as the mean SD. in DTNF7 immunized mice, over 98% of antibodies on day 49 were IgG1 subclass. the weaker antibody responses against TNF- would indicate the conformational constraint caused by the transplantation affect the immunogenicity of the epitope. however, the weaker anti-TNF- response of DTNF4 cannot be explained by the conformational constraint as D value of DTNF4 is lower than that of DTNF7. Fig 4A shows that conformations of the TNF- epitopes in all DTNF proteins are stable and close to that of TNF- except DTNF1 whose Ser 81 adopts coil conformation instead of extended conformation. conformational stability of the scaffold is perturbed to various degrees in all DTNF proteins with that of DTNF7 the least affected. DTNF7 vaccination inhibits arthritis development in collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. mice immunized with purified protein 2-weeks after collagen administration. DTNF7 vaccination delayed the onset of arthritis by 15 days, reduced arthritis incident rate by 46%. cytokine levels in mice sera immunized with alum formulated DTT or DTNF7 on day 14, 28, and 42. data are presented as the mean clinical score SEM. tope peptide (aa 80\u201396) elicits weak antibody response against the native TNF- [21]. the cyclic form induced stronger antibody response. the interatomic distance between end residues (aa80 and aa96) is 8.76. the function of T-domain is engaged in translocation of the catalytic domain of DT across the endosomal membrane in low pH-dependent manner. therefore, it potentially tolerates transplantation of a foreign peptide and renders the peptide a more stable conformation [24, 25]. DTNF7 is generated by replacing DTT 89\u201396 with the epitope peptide. the inclusion of one more residue in the epitope peptide increases TD to 12.11. DTNF proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. anti-mTNF- antibody titers in sera of mice immunized with DTNF proteins on day 49. serum samples were diluted 1:100. data are presented as the mean SD. the sustained anti-TNF- antibody response is beneficial to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. no redness at injection sites were observed in DTNF7 immunized mice. this data implicate that the vaccine formulation is safe. DTNF4 and DTNF5 have Tm values slightly higher than that of DTNF7. their poor immunogenicity cannot be explained by their thermal stabilities. Fig 3 shows the stability of DTT and DTNF proteins. conformation of the scaffold is unfavorable for the epitope presentation. the solubility of the recombinant proteins varies after storage at 4\u00b0C for 10 days. DTNF2 becomes completely insoluble after the storage. serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that persist in rheumatoid arthritis were decreased, although the level changes had not reached statistical significance. DTNF7 suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis in mice. serum samples were collected from CIA mice on day 28 and 56. the average of four mice with standard variation was plotted for each cytokine. no epitope-peptide vaccine has reached the commercial market yet. a stable secondary structure of the transplanted peptide is preferred. the length of the peptide should optimize to keep the span difference (D) to a minimum. the solubility of purified molecules after storage at 4\u00b0C is a good indication of its overall stability. DTNF7 is the first cytokine shown to be effective therapeutic target. antigen-specific regulatory T cells activated by therapeutics antagonizing TNF- or GM-CSF have been shown to play major immune suppressive roles in RA and other autoimmune diseases."}
