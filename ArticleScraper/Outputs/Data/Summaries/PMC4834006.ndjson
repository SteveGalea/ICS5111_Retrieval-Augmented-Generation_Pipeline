{"summary": "the aim of this research was to evaluate long-term pulmonary sequelae on paired inspiration-expiration thin-section computed tomography (CT) scans 3 years after influenza A (H1N1) virus-associated pneumonia. the patients underwent thin-section CT 3 years after recovery. patients who need more steroid therapy, need more mechanical ventilation therapy, had higher laboratory tests results (maximum levels of AST, LDH, and CK) and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs are more likely to develop lung fibrosis. thin-section computed tomographic scanning is more sensitive than chest radiography and provides more detailed radiological features. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiological changes on paired inspiration-expiration thin-section chest CT scans in patients 3 years after H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia during the postdischarge period. ninety patients who received an initial diagnosis of H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia were included in the study. four patients had coronary heart disease, two patients had cirrhosis, and two patients had diabetes. follow-up pulmonary function testing was performed in all 24 patients. patients complained of exertional dyspnea and/or reduced exercise tolerance. thin-section CT findings were described on the basis of the recommendations of the nomenclature committee of the Fleischner Society. the observers assessed the presence of ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation (interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines), parenchymal bands, honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, air trapping, and architectural distortion. the presence of architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing each lung was divided into three zones: upper, middle, and lower. each of the three zones spanned one-third of the craniocaudal distance of the lung on a frontal radiograph. nasopharyngeal or nasopharyngeal specimens from all patients were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the center for disease control and prevention, china. eight patients died during hospitalization; the remaining 82 patients were discharged after clinical improvement. four patients had coronary heart disease, two had cirrhosis, and two had diabetes. follow-up pulmonary function testing was performed in all 24 patients. patients complained of exertional dyspnea and/or reduced exercise tolerance at clinical follow-up. observers assessed presence of ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation (interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines), parenchymal bands, honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, air trapping. the presence of architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing was considered as evidence of fibrosis. each lung was divided into three zones: upper, middle, and lower. each of the three zones spanned one-third of the craniocaudal distance of the lung. the average percentage of each zone was 100%. twenty of the 24 patients underwent 31 chest CT scans between 1 and 3 weeks after the onset of H1N1 symptoms. nine patients had only one chest CT scan and 11 patients had two CT scans within the 3 weeks. ground-glass opacity and consolidation were noted in 100% (12/12) and 58.3% (7/12) of patients in the 1st week and in 100% (11/11) and 72.7% (8/11) of patients in the 2nd week. CK level 429.3 618.7 Chest radiographs Peak radiographic opacification (%) 41.3 32.5 Unless otherwise specified, data are the mean SD. CT: Computed tomography. 7 of the 24 (29.2%) patients showed no abnormalities on thin-section CT. most common pattern was ground-glass opacity along with superimposed architectural distortion in Group 1 patients (100%; 10/10) and ground-glass opacity in Group 2 patients (35.7%; 5/14). alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were most pronounced in the anterior nondependent portions of the lung. a portable chest radiograph obtained 4 days after the onset of clinical symptoms showed widespread consolidation, with central and lower lung zone predominance. the patient without mechanical ventilation therapy received cumulative prednisolone-equivalent doses of 700 mg. the maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were 90 U/L, 69 U/L, 486 U/L, and 1747 U/L respectively. the normal range of AST, LDH, and CK level at our institution is 0\u201340 U/L, 114\u2013240 U/L, and 0\u2013190 U/L respectively. the peak opacification on chest radiographs was higher in Group 1 patients compared with that in group 2 patients (Z = 2.743, P = 0.006) twenty of the 24 patients underwent 31 chest CT scans between 1 and 3 weeks after the onset of H1N1 symptoms. nine patients had only one chest CT scan and 11 patients had two CT scans within the 3 weeks. the predominant radiographic findings in the 20 patients were unilateral or bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacity. n = 24 Age (years) 40.4 12.7 Sex Male* 15 Female* 9 Treatment modalities Days in hospital (days) 17.8 18.2 Intensive care unit admission* 9 Mechanical ventilation* 6 Cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose (mg) 745.3 445.9 Blood test results (U/L) Maximum ALT level 42.3 20.8 Maximum AST level 52.6 28.9 Maximum LDH level 429.3 618.7 Chest radio 7 of the 24 (29.2%) patients demonstrated no abnormalities on thin-section CT. ten patients with the CT finding of architectural distortion were designated as Group 1 (10/24; 41.7%) traction bronchiectasis in 2/24 (8.3%) patients with mechanical ventilation therapy typically had pulmonary sequelae. the two patients typically had pulmonary sequelae and were most pronounced in the anterior nondependent portions of the lung, which showed only mild involvement during the acute phase. the patient without mechanical ventilation therapy received cumulative prednisolone-equivalent doses of 700 mg. the maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase in the acute stage were 90 U/L, 69 U/L, 486 U/L, and 1747 U/L respectively. the maximum AST level, LDH level, and CK level were also higher in group 1 than in group 2 patients. the normal range of AST, LDH, and CK level at our institution is 0\u201340 U/L, 114\u2013240 U/L, and 0\u2013190 U/L respectively. pulmonary sequelae occurred in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients. fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients. the main pathological change associated with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia is diffuse alveolar damage. thin-section CT evidence of architectural distortion (10/24; 41.7%) and traction bronchiectasis (2/24; 8.3%) were found. traction bronchiectasis represents irregular bronchial and bronchiolar dilatation caused by surrounding pulmonary fibrosis. air trapping is defined as parenchymal areas with less than normal increase in attenuation seen on end-expiration CT scans. it has been reported that the extent of air trapping assessed by expiratory CT significantly correlate with airflow obstruction. differences between patients with CT evidence of fibrosis and those without are most likely a reflection of the severity of influenza pneumonia. CK is also a biomarker of severity in H1N1 infection. the need for pulsed steroid therapy may reflect the magnitude of the cytokine \u201cstorm\u201d elicited by the viral antigen. ARDS frequently is followed by fibrosis in lung. fibrosis has developed in the anterior portion of the lungs, which showed only mild involvement during the acute phase. it is difficult to compare the changes in serial thin-section CT from patients with novel swine-origin H1N1 infection between short-term and long-term follow-up."}
