{"summary": "the lining is a simplified columnar epithelium made up of non-ciliated secretory cells called Clara cells, and a few ciliated and basal cells. in mouse, the pseudostratified epithelium is limited to trachea and extrapulmonary main bronchi, while Clara cells make up over 80% of the epithelium. CCSP is the most abundant secretory protein found in the airway surface fluid. it is widely used as a marker of the cells in the airway epithelial response to environmental stimuli. subpopulations of CCSP-expressing cells may function as true stem cells. mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. all procedures used in this study were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. two month old mice were euthanized by CO2, lungs removed and lobes collected. after washing in PBS, lobes were minced on ice and incubated in a small cell culture dish with 3 mg/ml collagenase in PBS (total 5 ml) goat anti-rabbit- FITC secondary antibody was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. cells were resuspended in the same but fresh media. CCSP staining was used as an isotype-matched negative control. Approximately 1105 sorted cells were washed twice in PBS with 1% FBS. 3 l of the cell mixture was mounted on glass slides, dried for 2 minutes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes. both fixed cells and tissue sections were blocked with 1% goat or rabbit normal serum for 1 hour. PCR was performed in triplicate in a MyiQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) the expression of each target gene was normalized to the expression of 18 S RNA, expressed as 2Ct. DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), 10 g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) 106 M hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml gentamycin/0.5 ng/ml amphotericin B 49 TBs and 26 BL structures were analyzed in lung sections of five mice. mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-h light/dark cycle. all the procedures used in this study were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. n B (Cascade Biologicastm, Portland, Oregon) plated in 100 mm dishes and placed to recover in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 18 hours. after washing in PBS, lobes were minced on ice and incubated in a small cell culture dish with 3 mg/ml collagenase in PBS (total 5 ml) two microliters of the rabbit anti-CCSP antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was added. cells were washed twice in PBS with 3% FBS, then 2 L goat anti-rabbit- FITC secondary antibody was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Approximately 1105 FACS sorted cells were washed twice in PBS with 1% FBS and resuspended in 30 l of cell Adherence Solution (Crystalgen, Commack, NY) both fixed cells and tissue sections were blocked with 1% goat or rabbit normal serum for 1 hour. slides were washed in PBS three times and secondary antibodies were added. one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 l using the QuantiTect RT kit (Qiagen) PCR was performed in triplicate in a MyiQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. well ultralow attachment plates at 10000, 5000, 2500,1250, 625, 313, 156, 78 viable cells/well in serum-free DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), 10 g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ terminal bronchioles (TBs) contained an intact bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) and visible alveolar duct. TB quantification of staining included all cells within 200 m of the BADJ. pan-cadherin expression is along the cell membranes, CCSP in the cytoplasm and cell membranes, mostly on outer surface. cells adherent to culture dishes were trypsinized and sorted using flow cytometry sorter. 97% of cells in CCSP+ sorted fraction expressed pan-keratin. only small population of CCSP cells expressed pan-keratin. expression of stem cell markers in CCSP+ and CCSP populations. mRNA expression of stem cell markers in sorted cells was detected by qRT-PCR. levels of CD44 mRNA were similar in CCSP+ and CCSP cells. efficiency of sphere colony formation was higher in CCSP cells than in CCSP+ cells. label-retaining cells can be used to identify populations that contain stem cells. a subpopulation of CCSP+/pro-SPC+ cells are capable of differentiating into Clara cells and alveolar type II cells. 1.1% of TB epithelial cells contained BASCs while no CCSP+/pro-SPC+ double positive epitheliums were detected in BLs. CCSP is widely used as a Clara cell marker. it is a cytoplasmic secretory protein. CCSP+ cells from bone marrow were isolated using flow cytometry. cells adherent to culture dishes were trypsinized and sorted using a flow cytometry sorter. in mice, about 25% of the lung cells sorted from one whole lung suspension were CCSP+ (Figure 1). Typical yields of sorted cells per mouse were 2.5105 of CCSP+ cells and 4105 of CCSP cells. sorted cell fractions with minimal (CCSP fraction) expression of CCSP mRNA. CCSP (green fluorescence) was expressed in almost all cells of the CCSP+ fraction, but rarely in the CCSP fraction. able CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 mRNA levels in CCSP+ cells. both CCSP+ and CCSP cellular fractions were able to form sphere clones. however, following 10 days of culture CCSP- cells demonstrated a larger colony size and higher efficiency of colony formation than CCSP+. 1.59% (39/2450) of cells in TBs and only 0.39% (12/4138) of them in BLs were BrdU+/CCSP+. the results suggest that the majority of mouse airway CCSP+ stem/progenitor cells may reside in TBs. a subpopulation of CCSP+/pro-SPC+ cells known as bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are capable of differentiating into Clara cells and alveolar type II cells. in the current study, a rare portion of sorted CCSP+ cells were also found to express the type II cell marker pro-SPC. in order to confirm the existence of BASCs in vivo, we performed CCSP/pro-SPC double stain the distribution of CCSP expression in non-ciliated Clara cells is described as cytoplasmic [23], [24], [25] bronchiolar Clara cells secrete such large quantities of CCSP that part of it remains stuck to the outer surfaces of cell membranes. a reproducible source of considerably purified Clara cells is necessary for airway stem/progenitor cell research. collagenase for lung tissue digestion followed by flow cytometry sorting, we achieved 98% pure CCSP+ cell population. we evaluated the expression of pan-keratin protein in CCSP+ cells. all cells expressed pan-keratin indicating that all the CCSP+ cells were epithelial. 1.59% of CCSP positive cells in TBs were label-retaining cells. 1.1% were CCSP/SPC double positive BASCs. in vitro, CCSP+ cells demonstrated stem cell-like features."}
