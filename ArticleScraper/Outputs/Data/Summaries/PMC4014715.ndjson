{"summary": "research conducted in the last 15 years revealed that host cells can express antiviral effector molecules, which inhibit spread of certain viruses by interfering with discrete steps in the viral life cycle. single restriction factors have been identified by screening approaches seeking to determine the molecular mechanism underlying a specific antiviral activity. tetherin antagonizes tetherin by removing it from the site of viral budding. this process depends on interactions between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and tetherin [15], which allow for a Vpu-dependent alteration of tetherin trafficking. this process depends on interactions between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and tetherin [16,17,18,19], which allow for a Vpu-dependent alteration a direct interaction of the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP and tetherin has been documented. EBOV-GP unlike Vpu can counteract artificial tetherin [28]. EBOV-GP in contrast to Vpu does not reduce tetherin expression at the cell surface. EBOV-GP/MARV-GP and LASV-GPC impeded tetherin counteraction by the filovirus GPs. a previously described virus-like particle system was employed to determine whether the glycoproteins were able to counteract tetherin. a previously described virus-like particle system was employed to determine whether the glycoproteins were able to counteract tetherin. Efficient release of Gag into the supernatants of cultured cells was observed. coexpression of tetherin markedly reduced release of Gag. this effect could be partially rescued by expression of Vpu, EBOV-GP and MARV-GP but not LASV-GPC. 293T cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HIV-1 p55 Gag, empty plasmid (pCAGGS) or tetherin encoding plasmid jointly with plasmids encoding Vpu or the indicated glycoproteins. expression of -actin in cell lysates was determined as loading control. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. vectors bearing EBOV-GPCD or MARV-GPCD showed a reduced capacity to transduce 293T cells when compared to vectors equipped with the wt protein. despite their modestly reduced expression, both EBOV-GPCD and MARV-GPCD were readily able to counteract tetherin. the cytoplasmic tail of filoviral glycoproteins is dispensable for tetherin antagonism by filoviral glycoproteins. Western blot analyses with anti-V5 antibody revealed that the exchange of the transmembrane domain between EBOV-GP/MARV-GP and LASV-GPC was compatible with robust expression. a signal comparable to that detected for wt EBOV-GP was observed when expression of ELE with V5 tag was visualized. the results were confirmed in at least two separate experiments. in order to analyze whether the exchange of the transmembrane domain modulated the cellular localization of the glycoprotein variants studied, we employed spinning disk confocal microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. despite readily detectable expression and particle incorporation of all mutants with exchanged transmembrane domain, none of the mutants were positive for mutant ELE. the transmembrane domain of EBOV-GP and MARV-GP is required for tetherin counteraction. the reverse exchange abrogated tetherin counteraction by EBOV-GP and MARV-GP. the transmembrane domain of the glycoproteins studied is essential for their ability to mediate virus-cell fusion. mutated residues in the transmembrane domain of EBOV-GP are conserved among filovirus GPs. all GP mutants were efficiently expressed in 293T cells. mutations in FP invariably reduced the ability of GP to drive virus-cell fusion. mutations in FP invariably reduced the ability of GP to drive virus-cell fusion. conserved amino acids in the transmembrane domain of EBOV-GP dispensable for tetherin antagonism. tetherin antagonism was analyzed as described in the legend to Figure 1A. a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with these glycoproteins (without V5 tag) was able to efficiently transduce 293T cells. no appreciable transduction was observed upon inoculation of cells with a vector bearing no glycoprotein. a previously described virus-like particle system was employed to determine whether the glycoproteins were able to counteract tetherin. mutagenic analysis of tetherin glycoproteins might reveal domains required for tetherin antagonism. mutagenic analysis of tetherin glycoproteins might reveal domains required for tetherin antagonism. expression of -actin in cell lysates was determined as loading control. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. cytoplasmic tails of EBOV-GP and MARV-GP comprise four and eight amino acids. the indicated glycoproteins harboring a C-terminal V5 antigenic tag were transiently expressed in 293T cells. expression of -actin in cell lysates was determined as loading control (lower panel) similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. ELE was observed upon detection with an antibody directed against the V5 tag. however, a signal comparable to that detected for wt EBOV-GP was observed when expression of ELE with V5 tag was visualized with an EBOV-GP specific antibody. expression of -actin in cell lysates was determined as loading control. the exchange of the transmembrane domain between EBOV-/MARV-GP and LASV-GPC is largely compatible with glycoprotein expression at the cell surface and particle incorporation. the indicated glycoproteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells and GP expression was detected by staining with V5-specific antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibody. despite readily detectable expression and particle incorporation of all glycoprotein mutants with exchanged transmembrane transmembrane domain of EBOV-GP and MARV-GP is required for tetherin counteraction but not sufficient to confer tetherin antagonism to a heterologous glycoprotein. the filoviral transmembrane domain is necessary but not sufficient for tetherin antagonism. -GP block membrane fusion and thus viral entry into target cells. all GP mutants were efficiently expressed in 293T cells. expression of mutants I666A + A667I + L668A, C670A + C672A was slightly reduced compared to expression of EBOV-GP wt. antibody raised against EBOV-GP was used for detection. results were confirmed in two separate experiments. cellular entry driven by the GP mutants was assessed as 100%. similar results were obtained in five separate experiments. the filoviruses EBOV and MARV induce a severe and frequently lethal hemorrhagic fever in infected human patients and non-human primates. the GPs of these viruses mediate entry into host cells and facilitate transduction of a broad range of target cells upon incorporation into retroviral or rhabdoviral vectors. deletion of the cytoplasmic tail was dispensable for tetherin counteraction. this is in keeping with previous results showing that amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail believed to be important for lipid raft localization of GP are dispensable for tetherin counteraction. the cytoplasmic tail seems to be required for GP function during viral entry but is dispensable for counteraction of tetherin during viral release. residues within the EBOV-GP transmembrane domain were dispensable for tetherin counteraction. this suggests that the role of the transmembrane domain in tetherin antagonism by filoviral GPs might be due to its potential impact on GP conformation or cellular localization rather than the presence of specific amino acids within this domain. all fusion peptide mutants tested were able to counteract tetherin. integrity of the fusion peptide and the ability of GP to efficiently drive virus-cell fusion is dispensable for tetherin counteraction. all PCR products were inserted into pCAGGS expression vector [53]. EBOV-GP mutants with point mutations in FP and TM were also generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were cotransfected with plasmids encoding Gag, tetherin, and the respective tetherin antagonist in a ratio of 2:1:1. the pelleted VLPs as well as the producer cells were lysed and boiled in SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. 105 293T cells were seeded in 22 mm glass bottom culture dishes. calcium phosphate was transfected with 3 g of V5-tagged glycoprotein expression plasmids. cells were permeabilized with 1 % Saponin for 10 min at RT. the day prior transfection cells were seeded at a density of 2.8 105 cells/6 well format or 7 105 cells/T25 flasks. cells were transfected using 6 g DNA in total for one well of a 6-well plate. medium was exchanged eight to 16 h post transfection. EBOV-GP mutants with point mutations in FP and TM were also generated by PCR-based mutagenesis and inserted via XbaI, MluI into pCAGGS. the integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was analyzed by automated sequencing. the Gag protein was detected with an anti-p24 hybridoma supernatant (183-H12-5C, 1:500) and a goat anti mouse-HRP antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; 1:1000) using a commercially available kit (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and permeabilized with 1 % Saponin for 10 min at RT. cells were stained for V5 using a 1:200 dilution of anti-V5 specific antibody and 1:500 diluted goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody."}
