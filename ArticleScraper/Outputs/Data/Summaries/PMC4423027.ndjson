{"summary": "polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been determined as an adequate tool for the identification of respiratory viruses. the frequency of mixed respiratory viral detection varies from 10% to 30% in hospitalized children. all patients hospitalized with URTI were screened during the period from September 2010 to April 2014. specimens were collected in the hospital and stored at 70\u00b0C until processing. the age of the patients ranged between 3 days and 80 years. the majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter. duplex PCR was carried out to detect influenza A and B viruses. triplex PCR was carried out to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses. PCR buffer containing 0.02 pg of each forward and reverse primer. 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. water was used instead of nucleic acids as a negative control. the age of the patients ranged between 3 days and 80 years. the majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter. autumn in Kuwait is between September and November, and winter is between December and March. PCR and RT-PCR for the Detection of newly discovereded Respiratory Viruses was performed using primers described by Ord\u00e1s et al. [27]. HCoV-NL63 RNA was detected using primers described by Mos et al. [28] and Boca DNA was detected using primers described by Allander et al. the specificity of the PCR was established for each PCR format using a panel of ATCC reference viruses to check for cross-reactivity to old respiratory viruses. DNA templates (110\u2013140 bp, Thermo Scientific) were used as positive controls for the detection of nucleic acid from HCoV-NL63, hMPV, Boca, WUV, and KIV. hMPV RNA was detected using primers described by Ord\u00e1s et al. [27] Boca DNA was detected using primers described by Mos et al. [23]. primers used to detect KIV and WUV DNA were previously described by Allander et al. and Bialasiewicz et al. [25, 26]. the specificity of the PCR was established for each PCR format using a panel of ATCC reference viruses. DNA templates (110\u2013140 bp, Thermo Scientific) were used as positive controls for the detection of nucleic acid from HCoV-NL63, hMPV, Boca, WUV, and KIV. is Bronchiolitis Pneumonia LRTI Total L LLTotal (%) Mixed detection Single detection Mixed detection Single detection Mixed detection Single detection Viral detection WUV 2 0 0 3 2 3 2 1 4 7 6 (1.7) 7 (2) 13 (3.7) KIV 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 3 1 4 (1.1) 2 (0.6) 6 (1.7) 7 (2) 13 (3.7) 19 (5.4) HCoV-OC43 1 9 1 13 4 3 7 5 12 21 four patients had triple viral mixed detection. highest combination of viral mixed detection was identified with HRV and AdV in 7 patients (2%), followed by HRV and HCoV-OC43 in 5 patients (1.4%), and HRV and FluA in 4 patients (1.1%). from the 49 (14%) patients with mixed detection, 33 (9.4%) of them were males (32 patients (9.1%) with double detection and one patient (0.3%) with triple detection) 16 (4.6%) were females (14 patients (4%) with double detection and 2 patients (0.6%) with triple detection) median age was 1 years for Boca, HCoV-OC43, and RSV. for the rest of the respiratory viruses KI, HCoV-229E, and hMPV it was 15 years of age. mixed detection was identified in 17 patients (4.8%) with pneumonia (15 patients (4.3%) with double viral detection and 2 patients (0.6%) with triple detection), 15 patients (4.8%) with bronchiolitis (14 patients (4%) with double viral detection and one patient (0.3%) with triple detection viral detection, and 7 patients (2%) with respiratory distress (RD) all suffered from double viral mixed detection. the majority of infections by the investigated respiratory viruses affected the lower respiratory tract (39 patients or 11.1%) rather than the upper respiratory tract (10 patients, or 2.8%). of 720 samples from inpatient and outpatients with RTI during a one-year period identified viral mixed detection in 95 samples (13.19%) in this study the virus positive rate was approximately 20% higher in LRTIs than in URTIs [9]. the majority of viral mixed detection was among children 1 years of age (20 patients or 5.7%) this is comparable with other recent studies [8\u201310, 31]. this may be due to an immature immune system of the infants and the absence of earlier exposure to respiratory viruses. a single WUV detection presented with cough, moderate fever, and wheezing and they were also diagnosed with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, URTI, and bronchitis. these findings suggest that polyomavirus can cause URTI and LRTI [43], compared with that of the immunocompetent population. mixed respiratory virus detection is not uncommon in patients with RTI. mixed detection may increase clinical severity of patients with pneumonia or bronchiolitis."}
