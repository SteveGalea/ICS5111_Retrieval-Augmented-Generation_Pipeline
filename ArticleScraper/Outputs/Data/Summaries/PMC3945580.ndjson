{"summary": "HSI was classified as a statutorily notifiable disease in 2009. a high number of children under the age of 6 years required hospitalization. a high number of children under the age of 6 years required hospitalization. a high number of children under the age of 6 years required hospitalization. HSI poses both a serious threat and has poorly understood effects. a knowledge gap has been identified between parental acceptance and HSIV. a local study was needed to investigate factors influencing parental acceptance of a new vaccination. four kindergartens with not less than 100 children were selected from the available school list. all of the kindergartens were located near public estates and parents that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years were selected. the questionnaire was based on the health belief framework and a study conducted by Mok et al.

You would be more willing to give your children HSIV shots if the injection was cheap. three researchers in public health and community nursing, as well as advanced practice nurses in child and adolescent health were invited to assess the content validity index (CVI) 80% of the total items were judged content valid, which is considered acceptable. the impact of variables related to demographics, preferable price of HSIV, perceived and actual parental knowledge of HSIV, and parental acceptance of HSIV were examined using the Chi-square test/Fisher exact test. factors with p-values less than 0.2 obtained from the above bivariate analysis were further examined using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. more than half of the subjects preferred HSIV to be free. 66.1% (n = 78) perceived knowledge of HSIV was insufficient at best. there was a significantly higher proportion of parents in the group against HSIV that preferred the vaccine to be provided free of charge. a logistic regression analysis showed that two aspects of the HBM and a motivating factor of vaccination taking were predictors for vaccine acceptance. the odds ratios were 2.367 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.272, 4.404] and 0.321 (95%CI: [0.149, 0.691]; p 0.01), and 3.675 (95%CI: [1.745, 7.742]; p 0.01), respectively. cause unknown side effects to children 0.321 (0.149, 0.691) 0.004 Motivating factors of vaccination taking: 3.675 (1.745, 7.742) 0.001 You would be more willing to give your children HSIV shots if the injection was cheap Note: Sensitivity = 73%; Specificity = 91.4%; Overall = 85.6%; OR: Odds Ratio. more than half of subjects preferred HSIV to be free, and 66.1% (n = 78) perceived knowledge of HSIV was insufficient at best. there was a significantly higher proportion of parents in the group against HSIV that preferred the vaccine to be provided free of charge. this eliminated the possibility that parents might be against the vaccine due to the concern of vaccine quality if it is free of charge. a logistic regression analysis showed that two aspects of the HBM (i.e., perceived benefits and perceived barriers) and a motivating factor of vaccination taking were predictors for vaccine acceptance. the regression model also had a very high Nagelkerke R2 of 0.631. 1.675 (1.745, 7.742) 0.001 You would be more willing to give your children HSIV shots if the injection was cheap. the following items were considered but finally removed by the forward stepwise (Wald) variable selection method from the regression model. HSI vaccination history of the children in their family had a positive impact on parental acceptance of HSIV. finding could help the government to increase vaccination rates by presenting vaccination as a social norm to encourage parents to vaccinate their first child. a significant number of parents that accepted HSIV believed that HSI could worsen underlying medical conditions in their children. however, this health belief factor of perceived severity of HSI might be weak in determining parental acceptance of HSIV. the fact that it disappeared from the final logistic regression model also supports the above argument. parents said they questioned the efficacy of HSIV and were unsure about adverse effects. this reinforces the notion that the two factors are key elements in the perceived barriers to vaccination. evidence on safety and efficacy is critical in increasing the uptake of vaccination. parents who accepted HSIV had a significantly stronger agreement (p 0.001) with the statement \"You would be more willing to give your children HSIV if the injection was cheap\" this result confirms the findings of a previous study stating that the uptake of vaccination against AH1N1pdm09 infection was unlikely to be high due to related personal cost. the government could explore the feasibility of increasing the subsidies for HSI vaccinations. the overall vaccination acceptance rate was 31.4% (n = 37), and this did not differ by education level. some studies have also noted that education is not associated with the acceptance of vaccination in developed countries [15] a previous study predicted that the uptake of the vaccination against AH1N1pdm09 infection was unlikely to be high and would be sensitive to personal cost [19] this indicates that the high-risk group of children was not fully protected by the limited subsidy coverage in private clinics. the factor of preferable price was ultimately excluded from the final logistic regression model. a lack of belief in the safety and efficacy of vaccines is the most commonly perceived barrier to vaccination. a lack of belief in the safety and efficacy of vaccines is the most commonly perceived barrier to vaccination [20,21]. a lack of belief in the safety and efficacy of vaccines is the most commonly perceived barrier to vaccination. a significant number of parents that accepted HSIV believed that HSI could worsen underlying medical conditions in their children. this could indicate that they believe HSI causes serious long-term effects in children. however, this health belief factor of perceived severity of HSI might be weak in determining parental acceptance of HSIV. studies have indicated that the perceived barriers to vaccination included the efficacy of vaccinations, adverse effects of vaccinations, and previous experiences with side effects of vaccinations. parents pointed out that the reasons for not accepting HSIV were that they questioned the efficacy of HSIV and were unsure about adverse effects. this strengthens the notion that the two factors are key elements in the perceived barriers to vaccination. parents who accepted HSIV had a significantly stronger agreement (p 0.001) with the statement \"You would be more willing to give your children HSIV if the injection was cheap\" this result confirmed the findings of a previous study stating that the uptake of vaccination against AH1N1pdm09 infection was unlikely to be high due to related personal cost. only the fourth statement, \"You would be more willing to give your children HSIV if the vaccination location was easy to access,\" was retained in the the government could explore the feasibility of increasing the subsidies for HSI vaccinations. the small sample size could be a major limitation of this study. some researchers have suggested that 10 observations are required for each predictor. to fight pandemics and enhance vaccination acceptance, it is essential that the government understands the above factors determining parental acceptance."}
