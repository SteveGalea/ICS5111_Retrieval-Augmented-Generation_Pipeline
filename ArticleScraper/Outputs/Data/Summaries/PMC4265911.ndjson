{"summary": "we identified key features of infectious disease reporting laws from sources such as the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act and the Council of state and territorial Epidemiologists. features included which categories of clinicians or other entities were required to report disease cases, whether reporting was required for suspect as well as confirmed cases, what authority health departments had to access additional case medical information, and if clinical specimens or materials were required to be forwarded to public health laboratories. clinical material must be submitted to the public health laboratory for at least some diseases, as a matter of routine or upon health department request. clinical material must be submitted to the public health laboratory for at least 1 of the following: all influenza, novel influenza, or influenza-associated hospitalization. only 9 of the 52 jurisdictions we studied mandated reporting of enumerated data elements. most (85%) required submission of specimens to public health laboratory as a matter of routine for specific diseases or upon request. most (85%) jurisdictions required reporting for at least a subset of influenza cases such as deaths or laboratory-confirmed cases. report individual cases for at least some subset of casesb 44 (85) Influenza-associated pediatric mortality 26 (50) Laboratory-confirmed influenza 23 (44) Novel influenza 19 (37) Influenza-associated hospitalizations 7 (13) Influenza-associated deaths 5 (10) Avian influenza 5 (10) Influenza-associated infant mortality 1 (2) Suspect cases reportablec 35 (80) Physicians and laboratories are mandated reportersc 40 (91) Specific mandated reporting by medical examiners, coroners, or veterinariansc 17 in the prepandemic period, 8 jurisdictions (15%) had robust influenza-specific reporting laws; the number rose to 14 (27%) afterward. in all, 19 jurisdictions (37%) made postpandemic changes to the reporting laws we examined. of the 46 jurisdictions responding to our survey on adoption of public health recommendations, the vast majority adopted CDC recommendations relating to antiviral use and vaccine prioritization without modification. fewer jurisdictions adopted CDC\u2019s K\u201312 school and day care recommendations without modification, ranging from 44% to 96% for various recommendations. in the prepandemic period, 2 jurisdictions (4%) had robust new or emerging disease-specific reporting laws. afterward, this increased to 3 (6%; Figure 1). 19 jurisdictions (37%) made postpandemic changes to the reporting laws we examined. the percentage of jurisdictions that adopted the recommendations ranged from 83% to 100%. fewer jurisdictions adopted CDC\u2019s K\u201312 school and day care recommendations without modification. some had widespread cases earlier than much of the rest of the country. 85% had an explicit mandate to report individual cases of influenza for at least a subset of cases. only 25% of these had an explicit requirement to submit clinical specimens for at least a subset of influenza cases. more than one third of states changed their laws since the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. officials may rely more on jurisdiction-specific case data than on aggregated national case data, leading to more jurisdiction-generated public health recommendations. a truly novel pathogen, perhaps one that infects members of a historically stigmatized group (as happened with HIV in the early 1980s), might present surveillance challenges. a new or emerging disease outbreak has emerged."}
