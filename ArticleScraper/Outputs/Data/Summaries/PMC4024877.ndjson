{"summary": "study of pathology and progression of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has been hampered by lack of a primate model that experiences severe respiratory response to the disease. rhesus macaques developed severe respiratory disease, including coughing, rapid breathing, and chest crackles within 3 weeks of infection. intergenic accumulation of 5-hmC in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex creates a unique epigenetic state conducive to experience-dependent gene expression. the 5-hmC modification is known to shape neuronal differentiation and aid the reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells. the findings suggest that Tet3-mediated accumulation of 5-hmC in the adult cortex is also required to establish epigenetic states that promote gene expression. the vulnerable spike protein\u2013cellular receptor interface might serve as a target for protective vaccines. 3B11 might serve as a potent ingredient in a therapeutic antibody cocktail. infested plants produced more HexVic than uninfested plants grown next to other uninfested plants. the results demonstrate a mechanism of plant defense in which insect-infested plants signal neighboring healthy plants with VOCs.
