{"summary": "the genus Ebolavirus includes five species (each represented by a single virus) the genus marburgvirus includes a single species, marburg marburgvirus. the first cases of filoviral infection were documented in three simultaneous outbreaks in west Germany and Yugoslavia. a single, 19-kb negative-sense RNA genome encodes seven proteins. the seven filoviral proteins are the glycoprotein (GP), the polymerase (L), the nucleoprotein (NP), a secondary matrix protein (VP24), the transcriptional activator (VP30), the polymerase cofactor (VP35), and the matrix protein (VP40) rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been the most highly characterized and utilized for therapeutic and vaccine development. the starting point of vaccine and therapeutic development remains small animal models due to the cost, ethical, and time-associated benefits. current clinical standard for filoviral infection is supportive care. breakthroughs have solidified the potential for this strategy of intervention. there have been a number of immunotherapies developed for other agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can provide potential roadmaps or precedence to facilitate the advancement of these products. a human recombinant antibody was generated and subsequently shown to protect 100% of mice against a lethal EBOV challenge. this antibody was then modified to generate h-13F6, a human recombinant antibody. this antibody also significantly protected mice against a lethal challenge of EBOV. the potential for benefit in combination with direct antiviral measures has yet to be assessed. a number of immunotherapies developed for other agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have solidified the potential for this strategy of intervention. nal antibodies range from murine monoclonal antibodies to recombinant-derived cloned human monoclonal antibodies from survivors of filovirus infection [37,43] development of new antibodies to be used for post-exposure treatment is on-going. an antibody (13F6) targeting the EBOV GP mucin-like domain was generated and subsequently shown to protect 100% of mice against a lethal EBOV challenge. DNA Vaccine DNA vaccine Adaptive Immune Response Cynomolgus macaque 100% EBOV 3 i.m. injections, 4 weeks apart Ebola rAd5 vaccine Vector-based vaccine, blend of 4 vectors expressing 5 different genes Adaptive Immune Response Cynomolgus macaque 100% EBOV 2 i.m. injections, 9 weeks apart 100% SUDV 100% MARV VSVG/EBOV-GP vaccine Vector-based vaccine the first clinical trials involving filovirus vaccines were based off of plasmids expressing EBOV NP and GP as well as SUDV GP. this strategy proved safe in 27 subjects involved with phase I testing. however, the prime/boost DNA vaccine strategy covering four separate plasmid doses administered three times each was ineffective at creating durable immunity. significant antibody titers were observed at 48 weeks post-vaccination. 100% and 55% of participants receiving 2 1010 viral particles were positive for GP (S/G) and GP (Z). CD4+ activation was observed with greater frequency than CD8+ activation in those receiving the vaccine. both implementations of the CAdVax technology demonstrated significant antibody titers. improvements led to three- to seven-fold increases in EBOV glycoprotein expression. adenovirus-based EBOV vaccine technology is promising. rad5 vectors were capable of stimulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the context of NHPs pre-vaccinated with rAd5. antibody titers reached an order of magnitude above those achieved in rAd5 vaccinated subjects (1:32,000 compared to 1:6,800), and CD8+ intracellular cytokine staining was 4.7-fold greater among heterologous prime/boosted subjects. only one vaccinated NHP showed signs of viremia as assayed by RT-PCR. titers ranging from 1:32 to 1:100 for all three glycoprotein components of the blended vaccine. MARV-rVSV was administered 20\u201330 min post-challenge with MARV. EBOV GP was effectively expressed from an attenuated vaccine used for wildlife against rabies virus in place of the wild-type rabies envelope glycoprotein, G. recombinant vector was unobserved in suckling mice when compared to the unaltered vaccine [68] this versatility offers increased storage options with an inactivated vaccine. in vivo studies with the MARV VRP offered the first demonstration of a fully protective filovirus vaccine. the technology offers several advantages, including high expression levels of heterologous genes, dendritic cell tropism, induction of robust cellular and antibody immune responses. xovirus-based Vaccines have demonstrated the capacity to protect NHPs from infection and stimulate strong immune responses. two candidates for this category of vaccines have been investigated to date. strategy produced IgG titers ranging between 1:1,600 and 1:25,600, much higher than the single dose. compared the immunogenicity of EBOV GP expressing HPIV-3 vector among nave and pre-immune NHPs. baculovirus-produced VLPs containing EBOV GP, NP, and VP40 were vaccinated three times at 42-day intervals with 250 g of VLP with RIBI adjuvant. EBOV specific antibodies possessed an 80% plaque reduction at titers between 1:20 and 1:160. three i.m. injections of 1 mg of VLP in 0.1 ml of QS-21 adjuvant spaced 42 days apart offered 100% protection against MARV and RAVV. one animal challenged with RAVV did exhibit slight morbidity. virus-like particles (VLPs) of EBOV and MARV can be easily generated in mammalian systems. EBOV-like particles (VLPs) can be efficiently generated in mammalian cells after expression of VP40 alone, but other filovirus proteins can be co-expressed. a recent report sought to utilize GP itself as the vaccination agent. in order to efficiently produce the protein, an expression vector was constructed. this protein induced both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. mice vaccinated with ZEBOVGP-Fc demonstrated 90% protection against a lethal EBOV challenge. a replicating vaccine that could spread through the target population after initial inoculation would be an attractive, alternative approach to filovirus development. a replicating vaccine that could spread through the target population after initial inoculation would provide high coverage with minimal initial vaccinations. a CMV-based vaccine would allow for this type of spread. compared to both HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP, and immunogenic, as 67% developed neutralizing antibodies against EBOV. a 4 106 PFU i.n. inoculation of HPIV3/F-HN/EboGP was able to protect 100% of guinea pigs against a lethal EBOV challenge. ive Immune Response Cynomolgus macaque 100% MARV 3 i.m. injections, 4 weeks apart HPIV-3 vaccine, replication competent Adaptive Immune Response Rhesus macaque-immune response evaluation (not challenged) Less immunogenic than HPIV-3 but could augment HPIV-3 in prime/boost strategy 2 i.n./i.t. inoculations, 4 weeks apart VLP Non-replicating virus particle vaccine. adenovirus vector vaccine used broad-tropism of the adenovirus vector to infect cells and once inside the inserted ebolavirus genes are expressed. the host immune system will recognize them as foreign and mount a response against them. cynomolgus macaques vaccinated 28\u201335 days prior to challenge. involving filovirus vaccines were based off of plasmids expressing EBOV NP and GP as well as SUDV GP. this strategy proved safe in 27 subjects involved with phase I testing. the prime/boost DNA vaccine strategy covering four separate plasmid doses was ineffective at creating durable immunity. ers were observed at 4 weeks post-vaccination with 100% and 55% of participants receiving 2 1010 viral particles being positive for GP (S/G) and GP (Z), respectively.

MARV-rVSV was administered i.m. 20\u201330 min post-challenge with MARV. surviving NHPs experienced significant rises in aspartate aminotransferase. EBOV GP was effectively expressed from an attenuated vaccine used for wildlife against rabies virus in place of the wild-type rabies envelope glycoprotein, G. recombinant vector was unobserved in suckling mice when compared to the unaltered vaccine. this versatility offers increased storage options with an inactivated vaccine. in vivo studies with the MARV VRP offered the first demonstration of a fully protective filovirus vaccine. NHPs exhibited 100% survival after vaccination with 107 focus forming units (FFU) of VRP in three consecutive doses spaced prior to challenge with MARV. human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) of these systems, the HPIV-3 system has been evaluated in NHP models of EBOV infection. each of these vectors was used to vaccinate NHPs both intranasally (i.n.) and intratracheally (i.t.) bukreyev et al. compared the immunogenicity of EBOV GP expressing HPIV-3 vector among nave and pre-immune NHPs. in these experiments EBOV-specific IgG levels were substantially decreased among HPIV-3 pre-immune NHPs. however, this hindrance was overcome when the NHPs were vaccinated with two doses of recombinant vector. VLPs are constructed through the matrix protein VP40\u2019s ability to drive the budding process. co-expression of additional filoviral proteins, such as GP, can dramatically enhance and stabilize the production of VLPs from target cells. all animals had no detectable viremia as determined by plaque assay. two injections of the VLPs correlated with a peak in homologous antibody titer. three injections correlated to peak heterologous antibody titer.

AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 are in phase I clinical trials. rNAPc2 Severe coagulation disorders are one of the most prominent features of filoviral infection. rhesus macaques and a 17% survival rate in MARV-infected rhesus macaques. rNAPc2 showed a clear benefit to survival as an increase in the mean time-to-death was observed. rNAPc2 has completed phase II clinical trials with a good safety record. rhesus macaques were infected with a lethal dose of EBOV. 11 were then treated with IV rhAPC 30\u201360 min after challenge. all control animals died on day 8 post-exposure; 2 survived (20% survival). for rhAPC-treated animals was 12.6 days, which is significant compared to the 8.3 days observed in placebo and historical controls. RNAi interferes with the translation of mRNA to protein products by either sterically blocking mRNA or by triggering RNase H-mediated cleavage of the DNA/RNA duplex, resulting in inhibition of gene expression. a mixture of lipids forming a bilayered liposome was designed. the SNALP ensures cell entry by preferential fusing with the endosome upon exposure to the decreasing pH of the endosome. the encapsulation was initially shown to completely protect guinea pigs when administered shortly after a lethal EBOV challenge. treatment of patients with severe sepsis with recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) resulted in improved survival. rhesus macaques were infected with a lethal dose of EBOV. rhAPC-treated animals died on day 8 post-exposure. coxsackieviruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV), human papillomavirus, RSV, influenza A virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, polioviruses, and sARS-CoV. recent developments in nanotechnology have made nanoparticles the solution to increasing rhesus macaques were given siRNAs targeting EBOV L polymerase, VP24, and VP35. two of the three monkeys given four doses survived lethal infection. all four monkeys given seven doses survived infection. there was little to no evidence of side effects associated with the treatment. innate immunity functions relies on identification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. PAMPs consist of unique carbohydrate moieties on external surfaces of foreign microbes, such as hexose and mannose, which are not expressed on the surfaces of the host cells. host proteins recognize these high hexose and mannose contents. a second screen was done using a collection of 1,990 small molecule compounds obtained from the NCI and the EBOV-GFP pseudotyped virus. this suggests that FGI-106 probably acts on a conserved pathway common to these four viruses, and potentially makes for a very intriguing antiviral. cohex-treated mice had a significant increase in mean time-to-death. highest concentration treatment group had a 20% survival rate. this suggests that Cohex has the potential to be an effective treatment against EBOV infection. compound FGI-103 was identified during a screen with an EBOV-GFP pseudotyped virus. it has shown strong antiviral activity in vitro against high doses of EBOV and MARV. compound FGI-106 also protected mice against a lethal challenge of EBOV. hexamminecobalt chloride (III) chloride (Cohex) is a complex of a cobalt (III) ion surrounded by six ammonia ligands in a full octahedral coordination. cohex was initially reported to have antiviral activity against adenovirus and Sindbis virus, and was subsequently thought to have potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities.
