{"summary": "the 2013\u20132016 outbreak in west africa exposed many failings in the international community's ability to respond swiftly and effectively to an emerging infectious disease. the failure to provide effective treatments for EVD is destined to be repeated for other epidemic-prone infections unless there are improvements in the way therapeutics are developed and evaluated. EVD is one of the few diseases in the highest priority category for national security and public health threat. all of the most developed candidate drugs were advanced with funding from military agencies. the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) allocated 300 million USD for medical countermeasures. EVD: 100% survival in non-human primate model [11] 26 million as part of a consortium NIH BCX4430 hepatitis C, yellow fever 2005a 20 million NIAID other applications: yellow fever\u2014100% survival in hamster model [12] EVD: none AVI-7537 target specific to EVD, closely related to precursor drug for marburg disease 2010 28 million DTRA other applications. despite non-human primate trials demonstrating 100% efficacy for TKM-100802 and ZMapp, these results had not yet been published. in 2014, at least 70 million USD was spent on EVD drug development [19] some of this was pipeline progression on existing candidates, including a number of new animal studies. some of this was pipeline progression on existing candidates, including a number of new animal studies. a variety of reports have been released that suggest ways to strengthen global financing for R&D for neglected and epidemic diseases and ensure affordable access [21\u201323]. a recurrent suggestion is to better lever the existing public sector funding already spent on drug development, in particular by ensuring that the resulting products are affordable and accessible. research response to EVD was slowed by 'insufficient collaboration and transparency'. a possible solution exists in adopting the new collaborative models developed for vaccine development. an efficient, robust drug development pipeline should be viewed as an integral component of global health preparedness. the average annualized economic loss from pandemics is estimated at 60 billion USD [20]. the 2003 SARS outbreak that resulted in 800 deaths cost an estimated 54 billion USD. it is unclear to what extent product accessibility and affordability were negotiated as a condition of this funding. alternative incentive mechanisms are required to replace drug patenting. there is also general agreement that alternative incentive mechanisms are required to replace drug patenting. demic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) provides one such initiative aimed at approaching gaps in the vaccine pipeline for emerging diseases. the diversity of representation in the founders should help prevent unnecessary duplication of effort by producing a unified strategic direction. collaboration between different sectors should also improve the quality of horizon scanning, so that efforts and financing are directed toward most likely threats. the first registered therapeutic clinical trial (favipiravir) did not begin until 17 December 2014, by which time, over 18 600 cases had already been reported to WHO [29] overall, seven trials opened to patient recruitment [30] and fifteen different therapeutics have been used in humans [31]. in, irbesartan and amiodarone were planned but did not recruit patients. assessment of other agents provided insufficient details to WHO to make an assessment of efficacy. a trial of TKM-130803 conducted in Sierra Leone found no survival benefit compared with historical controls. adaptive bayesian trial designs may be a solution, where numbers of cases are small, but the initial focus is on estimating the treatment effect and safety rather than hypothesis testing. adaptive \u2018platform trials\u2019 may be an efficient option, which allows the testing of multiple agents simultaneously. in each of these regions, the possible number of patients eligible for recruitment and the time in which to enrol them differ markedly. the most significant limitations include the evolving understanding of the natural history of an emerging disease, and that the research priorities of the affected populations may differ depending on the location and circumstances of the outbreak. this is a wasted opportunity to improve seasonal influenza care. it would be particularly suited to studies of host-directed therapies and trials of supportive care interventions. this approach would be particularly suited to studies of host-directed therapies and trials of supportive care interventions. the safety and efficacy of individual components remains unknown. there remains contention regarding optimal fluid resuscitation strategy, use of empiric antimicrobials, anti-diarrhoeals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and vitamin K. a fractured research response can lead to inadequate sample size enrolment in each trial. there is the risk of overwhelming regulatory authorities in the affected region. the number of applications to the national ethics committee increased fourfold in 2014\u201315 compared with the previous year. the most significant difficulty in generating \u2018peace time\u2019 protocols is ensuring that local governments and populations are adequately represented when the location of the next epidemic is not known. early recognition of the most appropriate local representatives during an outbreak is therefore critical, but often can be hindered by poor research infrastructure or unclear government organization. possible epidemiological patterns for diseases with epidemic potential, as demonstrated by MERS-CoV cases in three different regions. in each of these regions, the possible number of patients eligible for recruitment and the time in which to enrol them differ markedly. data adapted from that publicly available at https://public.tableau.com/profile/ian.m.mackay#!/vizhome/MERS-CoV_0/. the most significant limitations include the evolving understanding of the natural history of an emerging disease. there is a risk that the forward momentum of EVD research wanes. experimental agent FX06 was provided on a compassionate care basis to two patients medically evacuated to high income settings. the drug demonstrated encouraging results in a mouse model of dengue virus-induced shock syndrome (DVISS). similarities in the dosing and toxicity profile of the drug between diseases may help produce effective trial protocols if and when emergency trials are implemented. resuscitation strategy, use of empiric antimicrobials, anti-diarrhoeals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and vitamin K are key benefits to prioritization of supportive trial therapies. there are several key benefits to prioritization of supportive trial therapies. there are multiple consequences of too many clinical trials enrolling simultaneously. a fractured research response can lead to inadequate sample size enrolment in each trial. the number of applications to the national ethics committee increased fourfold in 2014\u201315 compared with the previous year. the most significant difficulty in generating \u2018peace time\u2019 protocols is ensuring that local governments and populations are adequately represented when the location of the next epidemic is not known. the most significant difficulty in
