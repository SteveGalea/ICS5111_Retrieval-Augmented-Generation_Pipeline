{"summary": "two castrated male calves from the herd, a 6-month-old (calf 1) and a 3-month-old (calf 2) presented with diarrhea, temporary anorexia, and blindness of a week\u2019s duration. neither the physical condition nor the appetite of either calf was suppressed by the condition of the calves. no abnormalities were observed except for complete blindness noted in the two calves from among 11 cattle. indirect ophthalmoscope and a portable fundus camera revealed swollen optic discs bilaterally in both calves. no retinal changes, except for papilledema and an enlargement of the retinal veins, were observed. fecal and (B) serum samples (M, marker; FS1 and FS2, other farm samples; FS3, fecal sample for calf 1; SS1, serum sample for calf 1; SS2, serum sample for calf 2; NC, negative control; PC, positive control) a level below 20 g/dl is classified as hypovitaminosis A. both calves had papilledema, accompanied by vision loss. changes in optic nerve and optic nerve head have been reported to be caused by necrosis. the RT-PCR tests for viral diseases, including the BVD virus, rotavirus and coronavirus, were negative. in a previous study, the clinical signs of hypovitaminosis A were observed in male cattle. among the herd of 11 cattle, it was the 2 youngest calves that were affected with blindness from vitamin A deficiency. cattle fed with a diet composed of white lees, rice straw and concentrate feed without green forage were affected with hypovitaminosis A. the vitamin A content of the cattle diet was demonstrated to be far below normal values. blindness can be classified into one of three types: night blindness related to the deficiency of the visual pigment rhodopsin made from vitamin A. iu/kg (for cattle on a high energy ration) or 100 iu/kg (for a pregnant cow or a growing heifer) vitamin A daily has been recommended in previous studies. 5,000 iu/head vitamin A added to the ration daily and the administration of a long-acting vitamin A preparation during winter can prevent ocular problems as well as abortion or infertility."}
