{"summary": "intercellular communication uses secreted molecules including nucleotides, lipids, short peptides, and proteins to relay messages between cells. these molecules can be bundled into membrane-bound vesicles or nanoparticles that transmit information (1, 2). a naming convention remains to be defined. glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. it has been shown to play an important role in protein trafficking to specific membranes. a similar signature was observed by mass spectrometry in EMVs. this suggests that glycans may be a sorting motif.

EWI-2 Knock-out Experiments Generation of EWI-2 Knock-out Cell Line Lentiviral stocks of the mission shRNA clone against EWI-2 were prepared by the shRNA core service. Sk-Mel-5 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Costar, Fisher) with shRNA-containing lentivirus (multiplicity of infection = 3) in growth media. after 24 h growth media were replaced with selection media (growth media containing 1 EMV Isolation Cells were grown in selection medium to 80% confluency in 150-mm plates. cells were then washed, and selection medium without FBS was added. after 24 h, medium was collected for EMV isolation. we chose to use Sk-Mel-5 for our EMV experiments throughout this work. to determine whether EMV-enriched glycans colocalize with protein markers of EMVs in microdomains, we examined the effects of genetic and biochemical manipulation of glycans on protein content. colocalization between Venus-CD63 and DSA-Cy5 was less strong. the correlations were in line with those observed for CD81 staining. staining was specific for complex N-linked glycans. the cells were imaged in multiple z-planes with fluorescence microscopy. the two channels were overlapped to show co-localization of CD63 and DSA. the overlap coefficients were determined for CD63 positive cells only. we confirmed the enrichment of EWI-2, G3BP, ADAM10, and the EMV markers CD81 and CD63 in Sk-Mel-5 EMVs. metallopeptidase ADAM10 and galectin-3-binding protein (G3BP) were previously identified in EMVs. a C-terminal FLAG-tagged EWI-2 construct was overexpressed in Sk-Mel-5 cells. it was immunoprecipitated from the total cell membrane fraction with an -FLAG antibody. the blot was stripped and re-probed for the FLAG tag using a different -FLAG antibody. a, EWI-2 FLAG recruitment to EMVs is similar to native EWI-2. Sk-Mel-5 cells were transfected with wt EWI-2-FLAG. TCM (25 g) and EMVs (10 g) were analyzed for FLAG. E, inhibition of complex N-glycan does not alter CD63 levels in EMV. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody. cell surface localization of EWI-2 is not affected by treatment. Sk-Mel-5 cells treated for 48 h with 1 mm DMJ had normal growth and morphology. no differences in the amounts of EMV isolated from DMJ-treated versus untreated cells. both EWI-2 and CD63 from DMJ+ EMVs showed a shift in molecular weights indicating a loss of complex glycosylation. we overexpressed the FLAG-tagged constructs in Sk-Mel-5. we examined their distribution in cells by fluorescence microscopy. all constructs showed predominantly cell surface binding and no colocalization with an ER marker. EWI-2-FLAG intensity from MV samples was normalized to the corresponding TCM samples to account for differences in expression. all data were then normalized to the WT. no effect was observed on CD63 trafficking to EMV in transfected cells. the results agree with previous results and provide strong evidence that N-linked glycans are a determinant of protein trafficking to EMV. this use assumes that CD81 levels are related to EMV amounts. overexpression of the mutants (N1, N12, and N123) should have a similar effect on CD81 if CD81 trafficking to EMV were EWI-2-dependent. to the contrary, we found that overexpression of the mutants had no effect on the levels of CD81 observed in EMV. blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. B, CD81 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts (by protein) of DMJ-treated and -untreated TCM samples. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. galectins are a polyLacNAc-binding lectin family. members of which have been shown to regulate protein trafficking in polarized epithelia. lycosylation alters galectin-3 recruitment to EMV. glycans enriched in EMVs colocalize with a lipid marker of membrane microdomains associated with EMVs. tetraspanins CD63, a glycoprotein, and the non-glycosylated CD81 are the most common markers of EMVs (8). poly/multiantennary LacNAc lectin DSA (22, 23) was enriched with tetraspanins CD63 and CD81. cells were grown in glass-bottomed dishes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde under mild, non-permeabilizing conditions. we used a CD63-Venus C-terminal fusion construct for our microscopy studies. colocalization between Venus-CD63 and DSA-Cy5 was less strong. the correlations were in line with those observed for CD81 staining. staining was specific for complex N-linked glycans. Mel-5 cells were transfected with CD63-Venus construct (green), incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, fixed with PFA, and stained with DSA (biotin-DSA, Cy5--biotin mAb, red). the cells were imaged in multiple z-planes with fluorescence microscopy and deconvoluted. we confirmed the enrichment of EWI-2, G3BP, ADAM10, and the EMV markers CD81 and CD63 in Sk-Mel-5 EMVs. equal amounts by protein of EMV and total cell membrane (TCM) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. the -FLAG blot was stripped and re-probed for the FLAG tag. it showed a diffuse band for the untreated sample, typical of glycosylated proteins bearing complex glycans. this band condensed to a single, strongly stained band at 70 kDa. Sk-Mel-5 cells were transfected with wt EWI-2-FLAG. TCM (25 g) and EMVs (10 g) were analyzed for FLAG. western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. E, inhibition of complex N-glycan does not alter CD63 levels in EMV. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody. Sk-Mel-5 cells treated for 48 h with 1 mm DMJ had normal growth and morphology. no differences in the amounts of EMV isolated from DMJ-treated versus untreated cells. both EWI-2 and CD63 from DMJ+ EMVs showed a shift in their molecular weights indicating a loss of complex glycosylation. -Mel-5 cells examined their distribution in cells by fluorescence microscopy. all constructs showed predominantly cell surface binding and no colocalization with an ER marker. the protein is properly folded and exported to the cell surface. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody for detection. no differences in the levels of EMV isolated from transfected cells were observed. CD81 Trafficking to EMV Is Modulated by Glycosylation in an EWI-2-independent Manner in Sk-Mel-5 CD81 is commonly used as an EMV marker in tandem with CD63. this use assumes that CD81 levels are related to EMV amounts and not other factors such as glycosylation. expression of the glycan site mutants (N1, N12, N123) should have a similar effect on CD81 if CD81 trafficking to EMV were EWI-2-dependent. to the contrary, we found that overexpression of the N1, N12, and N123 mutants had no effect on the levels of CD81 observed in EMV. immunoprecipitated samples were run on SDS-PAGE then analyzed for CD81. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. galectins are a polyLacNAc-binding lectin family. members of which have been shown to regulate protein trafficking in polarized epithelia. galectin-3 was not enriched in EMVs compared with total cell membrane. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. in contrast, DMJ treatment greatly enhanced the trafficking of G3BP into EMVs. the enhancement was surprising and was not due to increased availability of a cryptic epitope to the antibody. poly/multiantennary LacNAc lectin DSA (22, 23) colocalized with tetraspanins CD63 and CD81 by fluorescence microscopy. cells were grown in glass-bottomed dishes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde under mild, non-permeabilizing conditions. in initial experiments we observed diffuse staining with multiple -CD63 antibodies. the correlations were in line with those observed for CD81 staining. staining was specific for complex N-linked glycans, but not endoglycosidase H. the cells were imaged in multiple z-planes with fluorescence microscopy and deconvoluted. the two channels were overlapped to show co-localization of CD63 and DSA. the overlap coefficients were determined for CD63 positive cells only. we confirmed the enrichment of EWI-2, G3BP, ADAM10, and the EMV markers CD81 and CD63 in Sk-Mel-5 EMVs. in brief, Sk-Mel-5 EMVs were isolated as previously described by differential centrifugation. equal amounts by protein of EMV and total cell membrane (TCM) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. the blot was stripped and re-probed for the FLAG tag using a different -FLAG antibody than that used for the immunoprecipitate. the blot showed a diffuse band for the untreated sample, typical of glycosylated proteins bearing complex glycans. TCM (25 g) and EMVs (10 g) were analyzed for FLAG by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. a higher amount of TCM was used to allow visualization on the blot. AGE and Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. E, inhibition of complex N-glycan does not alter CD63 levels in EMV. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody. both EWI-2 and CD63 from DMJ+ EMVs showed a shift in molecular weights indicating a loss of complex glycosylation. a strong reduction in the EWI-2 levels in EMV was observed upon loss of poly/multiantennary LacNAc-containing complex epitopes. this is unlikely to be due to a general effect by DMJ on EWI-2 folding. all constructs showed predominantly cell surface binding and no colocalization with an ER marker (ER tracker, red, Fig. 4B) was observed. the protein is properly folded and exported to the cell surface. E, TCM and EMVs from FLAG construct transfected cells were obtained. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody for detection. no differences in levels of EMV isolated from transfected cells were observed. CD81 Trafficking to EMV Is Modulated by Glycosylation in an EWI-2-independent Manner in Sk-Mel-5 CD81 is commonly used as an EMV marker in tandem with CD63. this use assumes that CD81 levels are related to EMV amounts and not other factors such as glycosylation. overexpression of the mutants had no effect on the levels of CD81 observed in EMV. the EWI-2 knock-out cell line produced equivalent levels of EMV as wild type. based on this data, EWI-2 is not involved in the observed glycan dependence of CD81 trafficking. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. a stable EWI-2 knockdown of the Sk-Mel-5 cell line was generated using lentiviral stocks of shRNA. galectins are a polyLacNAc-binding lectin family. members of which have been shown to regulate protein trafficking in polarized epithelia. galectin-3 was not enriched in EMVs compared with total cell membrane. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. in contrast, DMJ treatment greatly enhanced the trafficking of G3BP into EMVs. the enhancement in the signal observed was surprising and was not due to increased availability of a cryptic epitope to the antibody. we examined the colocalization of the poly/multiantennary LacNAc lectin DSA (22, 23) with the tetraspanins CD63 and CD81 by fluorescence microscopy. cells were grown in glass-bottomed dishes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde under mild, non-permeabilizing conditions. in initial experiments we observed diffuse staining with multiple -CD63 antibodies; therefore, we used a CD63-Venus y5 was less strong although still highly significant. correlations were in line with those observed for CD81 staining. staining was specific for complex N-linked glycans. the cells were imaged in multiple z-planes with fluorescence microscopy. the two channels were overlapped to show co-localization of CD63 and DSA. the overlap coefficients were determined for CD63 positive cells only. we confirmed the enrichment of EWI-2, G3BP, ADAM10, and the EMV markers CD81 and CD63 in Sk-Mel-5 EMVs. equal amounts by protein of EMV and total cell membrane (TCM) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. the blot was stripped and re-probed for the FLAG tag using a different -FLAG antibody than that used for the immunoprecipitate. it showed a diffuse band for the untreated sample, typical of glycosylated proteins bearing complex glycans. this band condensed to a single, strongly stained band at 70 kDa. TCM (25 g) and EMVs (10 g) were analyzed for FLAG by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. representative blot of three biological replicates is shown. E, inhibition of complex N-glycan does not alter CD63 levels in EMV. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody. cell surface localization of EWI-2 is not affected by DMJ treatment. both EWI-2 and CD63 from DMJ+ EMVs showed a shift in molecular weights indicating a loss of complex glycosylation. a strong reduction in the EWI-2 levels in EMV was observed upon loss of poly/multiantennary LacNAc-containing complex epitopes. this is unlikely to be due to a general effect by DMJ on EWI-2 folding. all constructs showed predominantly cell surface binding and no colocalization with an ER marker. a schematic of WT and mutant (N1, N12, N123) EWI-2 constructs was observed. blots were probed with an -CD63 antibody for detection. no differences in the levels of EMV isolated from transfected cells were observed. CD81 Trafficking to EMV Is Modulated by Glycosylation in an EWI-2-independent Manner in Sk-Mel-5 CD81 is commonly used as an EMV marker in tandem with CD63. this use assume that CD81 levels are related to EMV amounts and not other factors such as glycosylation. overexpression of the N1, N12, and N123 mutants had no effect on the levels of CD81 observed in EMV. the EWI-2 knock-out cell line produced equivalent levels of EMV as wild type. in concordance with previous results, we saw no effect on CD81 recruitment to EMV. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. C, cell surface localization of CD81 is not affected by DMJ treatment. cells were fixed and stained with an -CD81 antibody. lectins are a polyLacNAc-binding lectin family. lectins are a polyLacNAc-binding lectin family. galectin-3 was not enriched in EMVs compared with total cell membrane. Western blots shown are representative of two biological replicates. in contrast, DMJ treatment greatly enhanced the trafficking of G3BP into EMVs. cleavage of N-glycans on EMVs from untreated Sk-Mel-5 cells had no effect on the level of antibody binding. tetraspanins enriched in EMVs colocalize with high levels of poly/multiantennary LacNAc epitopes (DSA) on melanoma cells. this strongly suggests that EMVs arise from membrane domains that are characterized by the enrichment of these glycans. gene ablation of the glycan attachment sites in EWI-2 also caused a loss of EMV recruitment. a likely mechanism for carbohydrate-mediated glycoprotein trafficking to EMV is through lectin-mediated oligomerization. several lectins known to be involved in protein trafficking are good candidates for recruiting glycoproteins into EMVs. in-3 in our EMVs found that it is associated with them in a glycan-dependent manner. previous work also identified galectin-1 in these EMVs. this suggests a mechanism for this trafficking event. this finding has important implications for the use of this tetraspanin as an independent marker for EMVs. further work is needed to fill in the details of how N-linked glycans control glycoprotein recruitment into EMVs."}
