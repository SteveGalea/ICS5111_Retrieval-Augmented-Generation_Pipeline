{"summary": "west Nile virus (WNV) and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are the leading causes of acute viral meningoencephalitis in the united states and worldwide (1, 2). following peripheral infection, these viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS), where they readily infect multiple cell types (including neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells) there are no current effective treatments for flavivirus-induced CNS disease. microglia become morphologically active following WNV infection, phagocytose WNV-infected neurons and antigenic debris. minocycline in these studies to inhibit microglial activation improved neuronal survival, suggesting that microglia act to promote disease following WNV infection. RESULTS PLX5622 treatment depletes microglia from the brains of adult Swiss-Webster mice. mice were fed with PLX5622 or control chow for 10 days before examining expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1). microglia levels were observed to be reduced >80% compared to those in control mice. PLX5622 depletes microglia from the CNS of Swiss-Webster mice. mice were pretreated for 10 days with PLX5622 followed by staining of brain sections for Iba1+ cells. microglia were observed to be decreased in both the cortex and striatum at magnifications of both 10 and 20. PLX5622 treatment significantly increased mortality following infection with WNV (n = 12 animals per group) mouse body weight during infection was also monitored, and there was no significant difference between untreated and treated mice. significantly increased WNV levels were detected in microglia-depleted PLX5622-treated mice versus untreated controls at all time points. viral loads in the spleens of PLX5622-treated and control-treated WNV-infected mice at 6 and 9 days pi were below the limit of detection for accurate interpretation. PLX5622 treatment did not decrease virus-induced expression of any of the cytokines/chemokines tested, indicating that microglia are not required for virus-induced expression of these genes. PLX5622 treatment increases mortality of mice infected with JEV. microglia-depleted PLX5622-treated animals showed an increase in mortality following JEV infection (P = 0.01) compared to untreated controls. PLX5622-treated mice took longer than their WNV-infected counterparts to progress to a moribund state. only PLX5622-treated mice that showed overt clinical illness had a detectable viral titer in the brain. PLX5622 treatment significantly increased mortality following infection with JEV (n = 15 animals per group) mouse body weight during infection was also monitored and showed no significant difference between untreated and treated mice (n = 5 per group at each time point) PLX5622 treatment depletes microglia from the brains of adult Swiss-Webster mice.

PLX5622 treatment increases mortality of mice infected with JEV. microglia-depleted PLX5622-treated animals showed an increase in mortality following JEV infection (P = 0.01) compared to untreated controls. there was no significant change in body weights between the PLX5622-treated and untreated groups. only PLX5622-treated mice that showed overt clinical illness had a detectable viral titer in the brain. PLX5622 treatment significantly increased mortality following infection with JEV (n = 15 animals per group) mouse body weight during infection was also monitored and showed no significant difference between untreated and treated mice (n = 5 per group at each time point) expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is not blocked following JEV infection of PLX5622-treated mice. PCR analysis of relevant cytokines and chemokines using indicated primers is shown. Graphs show the relative expression of genes in control-fed, infected mice (black bars) compared to PLX5622-treated, infected mice (gray bars), with values normalized to -actin. depletion of microglia has been shown to affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which could also affect viral loads within the CNS. earlier studies suggest that PLX5622 does not alter the integrity of the BBB (36). Interestingly, we found no difference in CD3 expression in PLX-treated brains compared to untreated controls. the disruption in chemokine and cytokine responses in PLX5622-treated mice may contribute to dysfunctional T-cell responses. the measured neuroinflammatory cytokines and chemokines following microglial depletion make it clear that many other cells may be responsible for facilitating neuroinflammatory responses. PLX5622 was generously provided by Plexxikon for in vivo experiments. mice were fed for 14 days before infection and monitored following 21 days postinfection. RT-qPCR was done on a CFX1000 instrument (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Bio-Rad software. titers were transformed to log10 value; undefined titers were arbitrarily given a value of 1 and thus become 0 on each graph. PLX5622 was generously provided by Plexxikon for in vivo experiments. mice were fed for 14 days before infection and monitored following 21 days postinfection. mice were perfusion fixed with 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. whole-brain homogenates were made using either zirconium beads followed by 2 cycles through a beadBug homogenizer or a Tenbroeck glass homogenizer. RNA was quantified on a CFX1000 instrument, and 1,000 ng was converted to cDNA using the Qiagen iScript kit. undefined titers were arbitrarily given a value of 1 and thus become 0 on each graph."}
