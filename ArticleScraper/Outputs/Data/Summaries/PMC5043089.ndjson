{"summary": "the purpose of this study was to obtain a natural antibiotic from Phenol-rich compounds; for the dressing and the treatment of chronic wounds. the combination of a sweet gel medium, including honey, maple saps, Phoenix dactylifera L. (date), pomegranate extract and Azadirachta indica gum. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an aerobic gram-negative bacterium. it is ubiquitous, exist in aqueous habitats, take advantage of humid environments. it is naturally resistant to antibiotics (beta-lactams, hydrophilic) it is also saprophytic and naturally resistant to antibiotics. biofilm formation seems to facilitate the survival of P. aeruginosa. the biofilm bacteria can withstand the immune response of the host. the presence of biofilms during infections has emerged as one of the greatest threats to global health. secondary metabolites include proteins, lipids and carbohydrates that are used for subsistence and reproduction. phenol and flavonoids compounds are involved in plant-plant interactions (allelopathy, and inhibition of both germination and growth) these compounds include lignin, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and anthocyanins. Tannins are phenol compounds that precipitate proteins. they are common in gymnosperms and angiosperms. they are more common in dicotyledons than monocotyledons. several studies have manifested the antibiotic activities of some phenol compounds in natural plants extracts. honey, maple saps, Phoenix dactylifera L. (dates) extract and pomegranate have also shown promise as novel antimicrobial agents. no effort has been made to evaluate the synergic effects of combined natural sweeteners on enhancing the antibiotic activities. the processing of the plants performed in this study was the same as the traditional method used by the people in the Iranian Bakhtiari tribe. phenol-rich compound sweet gel was prepared by blending four natural herbal extracts. eight mm wells were drilled into the agar by using a sterile stainless steel borer. no Scientific name Common name Site of collection Parts used 1 Acacia catechu (L.F.) anti-bacterial activity was indicated by an inhibition zone surrounding the well (including the well diameter) containing the plant extract. the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters. phenol-rich compound sweet gel produced a greater inhibition of Pseudomonas spp. than cloxacillin did. phenol-rich compound sweet gel had a greater inhabitation had a greater inhabitation on Pseudomonas spp. than the individual ingredients did an indication of synergic effects. phenol compound exhibited good antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. greater inhibition due to the compound compared to the inhabitation due to the individual ingredients on Pseudomonas spp. indicates significant synergic effects. no significant benefit for wound healing is seen with nutritional supplements. topical administration of zinc appears superior due to its action in reducing super infections and necrotic material. zinc oxide in paste bandages protects and soothes inflamed peri-wound skin. topical use of phenol-rich compound sweet gel should be safer than the other formulations. the phenol-rich compound sweet gel is an alternative medicine and bioactive dressing material. it is used to treat chronic ulcers, including burns, venous leg ulcers, ulcers of various etiologies, diabetes induced ulcers on the feet, unhealed sampling sites grafts, abscesses, boils, surgical wounds, necrosis process, post-operative and neonatal wound infection. and fibrosis to be maintained."}
