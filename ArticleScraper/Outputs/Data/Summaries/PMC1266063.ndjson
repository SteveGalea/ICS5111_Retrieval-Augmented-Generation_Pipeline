{"summary": "draft sequencing requires that the order of base pairs in cloned fragments of a genome be determined usually at least four times (4 depth of coverage) at each position for a minimum degree of draft accuracy. Finished sequence, without gaps or ambiguous base calls, usually requires 8 to 10 coverage, along with additional analyses, often manual, to close the gaps between them. variola was selected as the best available surrogate for bacteria at the time we began these analyses because: it is double-stranded DNA; it has a relatively low mutation rate, more like bacteria than like the RNA or shorter DNA viruses that have higher mutation rates and thus higher levels of variation. only recently have a fairly large number of Bacillus anthracis genomes become available to us. WGASA is the software used in the analyses here to create an alignment. each run of the SAP requires many runs of the DNA or protein signature pipelines with different random samples. each run of the SAP requires many runs of the DNA or protein signature pipelines with different random samples. protein signature pipeline Protein signature prediction and SAP methods have previously been described in detail (6). first, target genomes are aligned using WGASA. a set of gene pairs for both the plus and minus strands relative to the reference genome is required. WGASA, or Whole Genome Analysis through Scalable Algorithms, is used to align multiple sequences. it is the only available tool that enables multiple sequence alignment of draft genomes. WGASA requires at least one finished reference genome and the others may be draft. the algorithm functions most efficiently if anchors are frequent and dispersed across the genomes to provide even coverage. clustalw is slower and more memory intensive for large amounts of sequence data. draft SAP simulations are nearly identical to those using finished genomes. each run of the SAP requires many runs of the DNA or protein signature pipelines with different random samples. the DNA signature pipeline identifies sequence regions that are conserved among target genomes by creating a consensus based on a multiple sequence alignment. conserved fragments are then compared with the NCBI GenBank non-redundant database of amino acid sequences. resulting conserved, unique peptides that are at least six amino acids long from open reading frames are considered to be protein signature candidates. signature regions may be used as targets for antibody or ligand binding. WGASA can efficiently align large (e.g. bacterial) genomes. the developers have created a parallel version that runs in minutes. it allows the simulations to complete in a feasible time frame. a total of 10 random samples of size t targets and n NNs were selected. we ran the DNA Signature Prediction Pipeline for each sample. signature prediction based on conservation among the t target strains and uniqueness relative to a >1 Gb database. only Figures 3, 5 and 6 have the incremental n values, because for other plots of target sequence conservation only, the number of NNs was not relevant. results of the number of signature candidates or the fraction of the target genome that is conserved are plotted along the x-axis. plots for the number of TaqMan signature candidates for variola virus (A) finished sequence, (B) simulated draft target sequence with a low error rate and (C) draft target sequence with a high error rate. the best estimate of the true value is the quality measure determined using the entire target and NN pools. the protein signature prediction pipeline is run on each random sample. the range, median, 75th and 90th quantiles of the number of protein signature candidates for the samples of a given target size t is plotted in range plots. this is because composing the lists of NN proteins for random, temporary exclusion from the protein nr database would be difficult to automate for rapid, high-throughput computations. the SAP performs Monte Carlo sampling from the target and NN genomes, runs each sample through the signature pipeline and summarizes the results of the hundreds of signature pipeline runs in a single plot. the fraction of the target genome that is conserved is plotted along the x-axis as horizontal lines spanning the range. a 90% chance that the number of signature candidates for that sample would be less than or equal to 90% quantile mark. the expected outcome is a reduction in the number of signature candidates or the fraction of the genome that is conserved as the number of target and NN sequences used in the simulations increases. quality measure determined using the entire target and NN pools. best estimate plus constant c = 20 is at the location of the vertical dashed line. the 75% quantile for each range is shown with a black, vertical tick mark. variola virus We had sequence data for four strains of marburg virus, both the actual draft and the finished versions of those same isolates. the identities of these sequences are provided in the appendix. draft simulator program randomly cuts a genome into contigs of a size randomly selected from an exponential distribution. the size of the contig is selected randomly from an exponential distribution with a non-zero minimum contig size and a maximum contig size that is a fraction of the mean genome length for the species. we performed six sets of analyses using simulated variola draft. three sets of simulated variola draft runs of the SAP used the following parameters: probability of a gap between contigs = 0.95; probability of overlap between contigs = 0.05; minimum gap size if there is overlap (uniform distribution) = 20 bp; maximum overlap = 40 bp; minimum contig size = 0.5 (mean genome length) bp mean contig size = 0.5 (mean genome length the other three simulated variola draft runs used all the same parameters as above, except that the sequencing error rates were dramatically lower. these runs were referred to as low error rate, or high-quality draft. in the first, only the target sequences were simulated into draft. WGASA requires that one of the sequences be a finished genome for reference. for each random sample from the pool of target genomes, one genome was randomly selected to be the finished genome. the other genomes in the sample simulation are replaced with simulated draft versions of the actual finished sequences. this is merely a rough estimate, and the actual costs of sequencing any given organism may differ substantially from this rule-of-thumb calculation. in Equation 1, it is assumed that the cost of sequencing viruses does not decline for sequencing second and subsequent isolates. variola virus was the only organism for which we could obtain sufficient number of draft genomes for the SAP Monte Carlo simulations. a total of 814 simulations for DNA signatures, i.e. individual runs of the DNA signature pipeline, and 48 simulations for protein signatures were performed using Marburg finished and draft data. a random Bernoulli trial again determines whether there is a gap or overlap between the first and second contigs. the size of the gap or overlap is selected from the appropriate uniform distribution. additional contigs are simulated in a similar manner. three sets of simulated variola draft runs of the SAP used the following parameters. probability of a gap between contigs = 0.95; probability of overlap between contigs = 0.05; minimum gap size if there is overlap (uniform distribution) = 1 bp; maximum gap size = 2000 bp; minimum overlap if there is overlap (uniform distribution) = 20 bp; maximum overlap = 40 bp; probability of sequence errors inside large contigs = 0.01; probability the intermediate quality simulated draft is consistent with error rates for draft sequencing cited in the literature (1,3). in the first, only the target sequences were simulated into draft. in the second, both target and NN sequences were simulated into draft. simulation involved selecting the subset of target and NN sequences to be included. each of the draft runs repeated for both low and high sequencing error rates. the combination (iv) was also run with intermediate quality simulated draft variola and draft NNs. RESULTS Marburg virus It may be substantially less expensive, on the order of 3-fold, to generate draft compared with finished sequence data for an organism like Marburg virus. draft sequencing of this low quality (3 to 6) causes a dramatic decline in the ability to computationally eliminate regions of poor conservation. 57.79 0 4 23 Variola major virus Simulated draft, high error rate Simulated draft, high error rate 58.68 58.36 0 8 23 Variola major virus Finished Simulated draft, high error rate 98.90 3.91 1 71 49 Variola major virus Simulated draft, low error rate Simulated draft, low error rate Simulated draft, low error rate 98.65 4.43 0 86 49 Variola major virus Simulated draft, low the conservation range plots are virtually identical for finished and high-quality draft, and indicate that 98% of the genome appears to be conserved among sequenced isolates. the range plots for the number of TaqMan signature candidates are very similar for finished and high-quality draft. at least four NN sequences are necessary to ensure that signature regions are unique, whether the NN data are low- or high-quality draft or finished. this results because errors in the NN sequences occur at random locations that differ in each NN sequence. this results because errors in the NN sequences occur at random locations that differ in each NN sequence. conserved bases in the conservation gestalt may break up a region into conserved fragments of 18 bases long. the conserved+unique fraction is 4% with finished variola target data, but is overestimated at 58% with low-quality draft. if there is a low level of conservation then we may overestimate the fraction of the genome that is unique. 97 peptides are highly conserved among all currently sequenced variolas. this pattern indicates that there is a set of 97 peptides that are unlikely to be eroded even as more sequence data are obtained. draft sequencing of this low quality (3 to 6) for an organism like marburg causes a dramatic decline in the ability to computationally eliminate regions of poor conservation. the deficiencies of draft data give a false impression that there is 92.6% sequence conservation. each additional finished genome reduces the conserved fraction by 5% compared with a reduction of only 2% per genome for the draft data. 43 250 198 Marburg virus Finished Finished 75.19 74.36 0 38 41 The percent of the target genome that is conserved varies slightly among the runs using finished target sequences. overestimation of conservation also results in overestimation of the number of signature candidates. plots for the number of TaqMan signature candidates are very similar for finished sequence data, high or intermediate quality draft target, and high or low-quality draft NNs. with low-quality draft target, it appears that only 58% of the genome is conserved among isolates. with low-quality draft target, only 58% of the genome is conserved among isolates. a low-quality draft gives the false impression that there are fewer and shorter regions that are conserved and suitable as signature regions than is actually the case. a conservation gestalt is generated from the sequence alignment, in which non-conserved bases are replaced by a dot (\u2018). if there is a low level of conservation, then we may overestimate the fraction of the genome that is unique. 97, 14, 6 and 0 protein signatures are predicted using finished, low error, intermediate error and high error draft target data. this means that sequencing errors substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation. with finished data, there is a large range in the number of peptide signature candidates predicted with 17 or fewer variola genomes. variola simulations with intermediate to high-quality draft deliver virtually the same results as finished genomes. NN sequencing may be of low coverage, and thus of low quality, without serious detriment to signature prediction, as long as there are at least four NN draft genome sequences. a base to be considered \u2018conserved\u2019 if it is present in only a fraction of the genomes (e.g. 75%) rather than the standard requirement for 100% conservation when finished sequence data are used. we have used this \u2018ratio-to-win\u2019 option to generate signature candidates for some highly divergent RNA viruses."}
