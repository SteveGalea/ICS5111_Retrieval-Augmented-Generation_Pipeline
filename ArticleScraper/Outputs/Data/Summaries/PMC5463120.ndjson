{"summary": "HRSV is the most common causal agent of respiratory infections in infants. it is an enveloped virus (genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae) its genome consists of a nonsegmented single-stranded RNA that encodes 11 proteins. the authors describe the main genotypes of HRSV A and B, which caused infections in infants hospitalized in the university hospital of Universidade de So Paulo. the genotype characteristics and clinical and epidemiological features of HRSV are analyzed. the infections caused by the new genotype HRSV AON1 are compared to other genotypes that were circulating during the study period. samples were shipped within 48 hours under refrigeration and analyzed by in-house singleplex real-time RT-PCR assays. the one-step qPCR was carried out with the AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR kit in the 7300 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using the super Script III kit. the amplified products of gene G were 490 bp, were purified by ExoSap-IT. the amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. the null hypothesis was rejected when the probability was less than 5% (P 0.05). we used IBM SPSS Statistic software, version 23. 2.1. HRSV = human rhinovirus; PV = parainfluenza virus; HMPV = coronavirus HKU; OC43 = coronavirus OC43; RV neg = result was negative for respiratory viruses. most of the HRSV isolates were found to cluster in the ON1 genotype. the topology of the HRSV A tree shows the study samples identified (PEG) compared to the specimens from GeneBank, identified by their access number. Clades in red show samples that belong to genotype NA2 and clades in green show samples that belong to genotype NA1. the comparative clinical analyses included 32 infants with a HRSV single infection. study showed the strong predominance of HRSV infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, predominance of the HRSVA ON1 genotype, and occurrence of the NA1 and NA2 genotypes, previously unidentified in southeast region of Brazil. cocirculation of HRSV A and B was observed, with a predominance of HRSVA (76.7%), as reported in most studies conducted in other countries. previous studies showed the cocirculation of different genotypes of HRSV A and B during the same viral season. all of the sequenced HRSVB isolates were found to cluster in the BA genotype. the sequenced isolates had the signature 60-bp duplication in the G protein when aligned with representative sequences from all of the B subgroup. some authors suggest the occurrence of a greater number of cases during seasons in which new genotypes predominate. a mean age at 2 months showed the precocity of the infection, which was independent of the infecting genotype. some prognostic factors that are relevant in respiratory infections were also similar, such as exposure to tobacco smoke and breastfeeding. study showed a high rate of HRSV detection in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. five genotypes were found, with a predominance of genotype A ON1."}
