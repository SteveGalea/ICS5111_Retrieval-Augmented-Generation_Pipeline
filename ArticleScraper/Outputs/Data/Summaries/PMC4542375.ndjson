{"summary": "emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 demonstrates the zoonotic potential of this family of viruses. there is still much that is unclear regarding the role of the CoV E protein in infection. three roles for CoV E protein have been proposed. a role for CoV E in assembly has been suggested. residues in the HD of SARS-CoV E have been shown to promote viral fitness. the precise function of E as an ion channel in infected cells and animals is unknown. the best evidence for the ion channel activity of the CoV E protein during infection comes from experiments demonstrating that the drug hexamethylene amiloride, a known channel inhibitor, reduces the titer of MHV grown in cultured cells. the pBluescript, pCAGGS IBV E, pCAGGS IBV E, pCAGGS IBV E-T16A, pCAGGS IBV M, pCAGGS IBV N, and pCAGGS VSV G plasmids have been previously described. the plasmid was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis of the pBluescript IBV E expression plasmid. the rabbit polyclonal and rat polyclonal antibodies recognizing the C terminus of IBV E have been described previously (32) the rabbit anti-IBV M and anti-IBV N antibodies have also been described. the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies were from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ) heLa cells transiently expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant IBV E or VSV G were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 16 h posttransfection. the cells were lysed for 10 min on ice with 100 l of DDM lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM a 4-concentrated sample buffer was added to 15% of each fraction collected. the samples were heated at 100\u00b0C for 3 to 5 min in the presence of 2 to 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) s were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-rat immunoglobulin (1:10,000) after washing, the membranes were incubated with the HyGlo Quick Spray chemiluminescent detection reagent. images were collected using a Versa Doc model 5000 imaging system. virions were pelleted with a 50-min spin as described above. virions were resuspended in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. cross-linking and anti-IBV E Dynabead immunoprecipitation performed. the Dynabeads were placed on a magnet for 1 min, the supernatant was removed, 100 l of 1 sample buffer was added to each sample, and then the mixture was split in half. one half was treated with 5% BME to reverse the cross-links, and the other half was left unreduced. e complexes were collected using 20 l of washed Staphylococcus aureus Pansorbin cells. immunocomplexes were eluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing. the cells were spun out, and the supernatant was diluted with an equal amount of 150 mM Na-citrate (pH 5.5) with endo H (50 units per sample) the samples were boiled for 5 min at 100\u00b0C in the presence of 3.75% BME and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Labeled VSV G was visualized using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimager (Bio-Rad) and quant t 33285 (0.1 g/ml) to stain the DNA, rinsed twice in PBS-Gly, and mounted on slides in glycerol containing 0.1 M N-propyl gallate. data analysis was performed using iVision (BioVision Technologies) and Microsoft Excel software. the supernatant was loaded on a 20% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 234,000 g in a TLA-110 rotor for 60 min. the pellet containing VLPs was resuspended in 2 glycoprotein denaturation buffer (New England BioLabs) the cell fraction was pelleted in PBS at 4,000 g for 2 min. pBluescript, pCAGGS IBV E, pCAGGS IBV E-T16A, pCAGGS IBV M, pCAGGS IBV N, and pCAGGS VSV G plasmids have been previously described. the cells were used in experiments at 16 to 22 h after transfection, unless otherwise noted. antibodies recognizing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and VSV glycoprotein (G) have been previously described. rabbit anti-IBV M and anti-IBV N antibodies have also been described. lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatants were loaded onto 5-ml 5 to 20% linear sucrose gradients. gradients were spun at 192,000 g for 24 h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman SW55Ti ultracentrifuge rotor. samples were heated at 100\u00b0C for 3 to 5 min in the presence of 2 to 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) Immobilon membranes (Millipore) membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS); 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween vero cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. lysed in DDM lysis buffer and protease inhibitor cocktail at 8 h postinfection. the step gradients were spun at 198,000 g for 90 min in an ultracentrifuge rotor at 4\u00b0C. fractions representing low-molecular-weight pool and high-molecular-weight pool were combined. cross-linked samples were then added to 1 mg of washed rabbit anti-IBV E IgG-conjugated Dynabeads. the beads were prepared by conjugating 20 g of protein G-Sepharose-purified rabbit anti-IBV E IgG per mg of Dynabeads. cells were starved in cysteine-methionine-free DMEM for 15 min. labeled with 250 Ci of EasyTag Express protein labeling mix. labeled IBV E was visualized using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimager. cells were starved in cysteine-methionine-free DMEM for 15 min. labeled with 60 Ci of EasyTag Express protein labeling mix. lysed in 500 l of 1 detergent solution with protease inhibitor cocktail. cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 22\u00b0C. the fixative was quenched in PBS containing 10 mM glycine (PBS-Gly) the cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min. the percentage of cells with a disassembled Golgi complex was determined. for each IBV E protein, the percentage of cells with a disassembled Golgi complex was determined by dividing the number of cells scored as disrupted. all samples were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs) ten percent of the cell fractions and 100% of the VLP fractions were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. proteins were detected using rabbit anti-IBV E (1:10,000), rabbit anti-IBV M (1:5,000), rabbit anti-IBV N (1:10,000) primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti- we refer to the two IBV E peaks as the low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) pools. the molecular mass of the HMW pool of IBV E was in the range of 65 to 75 kDa, potentially representing a higher-order oligomer of the protein (e.g., homopentamer) we followed the newly synthesized pool of IBV E protein by metabolic labeling. cells transiently expressing IBV E were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]cysteine-methionine and chased for 0 or 60 min. the cells were lysed and run over sucrose gradients as described above. heLa cells expressing IBV E were lysed at 12, 16, or 20 h posttransfection. cell lysates were separated on 5 to 20% sucrose gradients. eluates were treated with or without reducing agent to reverse cross-links. IBV E from HeLa cells expressing IBV E were cross-linked with a reducible cross-linker (DSP), immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV E antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting. the dots on the nonreduced panel indicate cross-linked species. vero cells infected with IBV were lysed at 8 h postinfection and run on a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient. virions were purified from infected cell supernatant at 24 h postinfection. virions were solubilized with DDM and run over a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient. the majority of IBV E in both virions is in a higher-order homo-oligomeric state. we used cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the HMW fraction from secreted virions to show that the majority of IBV E in both is in a homo-oligomeric state. we mutated IBV E A26 to phenylalanine to determine the effect on the cellular secretory pathway. the residue at the position equivalent to V25 in SARS-CoV E is A26. the residue at the position equivalent to V25 in SARS-CoV E is A26. IBV E-A26F, or IBV M (as a control) were pulse-labeled and chased for 10 min. VSV G was immunoprecipitated at the indicated times of chase and digested with endo H. we then tested the effects of the IBV E-A26F mutant on the trafficking of the model cargo protein VSV G. we also made for IBV E expressed during infection. preliminary data suggested that IBV E-T16A in fraction 15 exists in a distinct peak and is not a heterogeneous aggregate. the bead lane indicates antibody-conjugated beads that were analyzed in parallel as a negative control. this blot is representative of the blots from two independent experiments with similar results. we observed a window of IBV E-T16A for the two HD mutants. affect ion channel activity and oligomerization of the E protein, did markedly reduce the predicted oligomerization in the HMW pool. we previously reported that cells expressing IBV E and IBV E-T16A produce VLPs to a similar extent when coexpressed with IBV M and IBV N. this suggests that T16 in IBV E is required for secretory pathway disruption but not for virion assembly. IBV E-T16A supports VLP production, while IBV E-A26F does not. a representative immunoblot showed the amount of IBV N, M, and E coexpressed in 10% of HeLa cell fractions and 100% of VLP fractions. the amount of M released with WT E was set equal to 1. VSV G ran slightly further into the gradient than the LMW pool of IBV E, while the HMW pool of IBV E ran slightly further than VSV G. this led us to predict that the molecular mass of the HMW pool of IBV E was in the range of 65 to 75 kDa. in the absence of SDS, IBV E was again enriched in two peaks. we followed the newly synthesized pool of IBV E protein by metabolic labeling. cells transiently expressing IBV E were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]cysteine-methionine and chased for 0 or 60 min. the cells were run over sucrose gradients as described above. HeLa cells expressing IBV E were lysed at 12, 16, or 20 h posttransfection. cell lysates were separated on 5 to 20% sucrose gradients. eluates were treated with or without reducing agent to reverse cross-links. cells expressing IBV E were cross-linked with a reducible cross-linker (DSP), immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV E antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting. input lanes represent 2.0% of each immunoprecipitated sample to demonstrate the relative amount of IBV E in the LMW and HMW pools. a new tab IBV E is present in two pools in infected cells and virions. vero cells infected with IBV were lysed at 8 h postinfection. virions were purified from infected cell supernatant at 24 h postinfection. virions were resuspended in lysis buffer containing DDM. we used cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the HMW fraction from secreted virions to show that the majority of IBV E in this pool consisted of higher-order oligomers. we previously reported that the wild-type (WT) IBV E protein alters the cellular secretory pathway during transient expression in HeLa cells. the residue at the position equivalent to V25 in SARS-CoV E is A26. we mutated IBV E A26 to phenylalanine to determine the effect on the cellular secretory pathway. the residue at the position equivalent to V25 in SARS-CoV E is A26. we then tested the effects of the IBV E-A26F mutant on the trafficking of the model cargo protein VSV G. we then tested the effects of the IBV E-A26F mutant on the trafficking of the model cargo protein VSV G. preliminary data using steeper sucrose gradients suggested that IBV E-T16A in fraction 15 exists in a distinct peak and is not a heterogeneous aggregate. experiments to characterize this form of IBV E are in progress. the bead lane indicates antibody-conjugated beads that were analyzed in parallel as a negative control. this blot is representative of the blots from two independent experiments with similar results. we observed a window of IBV E expression for the two HD mutants by [35S]cysteine-methionine metabolic labeling. the effects of IBV E on the cellular secretory pathway correlate with the LMW pool. we previously reported that cells expressing IBV E and IBV E-T16A produce VLPs to a similar extent when coexpressed with IBV M and IBV N. this suggests that T16 in IBV E is required for secretory pathway disruption. IBV E-T16A supports VLP production, while IBV E-A26F does not. a representative immunoblot showed the amount of IBV N, M, and E coexpressed in 10% of HeLa cell fractions and 100% of VLP fractions. the amount of M released with WT E was set equal to 1. Error bars represent the SEMs from three independent experiments. a small host protein interacting with IBV E could explain migration of the LMW pool further into the gradient than the E monomer. if an interacting host protein is present, it is possible that IBV E does indeed form a homopentamer in the HMW pool. we hypothesize that the two pools of IBV E may represent populations of IBV E with distinct functions. the sucrose gradient profiles of the IBV E-T16A and -A26F mutants support this idea. the findings of pulse-chase analyses of the HD mutants correlate with the findings for the WT protein. phenotypes in transfected cells correlate with the LMW pool. suggest that T16 in the HD is required for putative ion channel activity. this interaction is crucial for modification of the host cell environment. the IBV E-T16A mutant released 4-fold more IBV M into the supernatant of IBV E-T16A-expressing cells in our VLP assay. virions with the T16A mutation would travel more quickly through the secretory pathway, leading to damage from host proteases and reduced infectivity. the hepatitis c virus p7 viroporin is required for the assembly and release of infectious virus (41, 45\u201350) the secretory pathway phenotypes induced by the WT IBV E protein in transfected cells are likely to be independent of virus ion channel activity. this could occur through a regulated interaction with a host cell protein. we determined that the IBV E in the LMW pool is slightly larger than the predicted monomer present on the gradient in the presence of SDS. the HMW pool contains a monomer or dimer, whereas the HMW pool contains a homo-oligomer up to a hexamer. a model for homopentamer formation by IBV E has been reported by Parthasarathy et al., who demonstrated by perfluoro-octanoic acid-PAGE that IBV E purified from bacteria can form an oligomer consistent with a homopentamer. the findings of pulse-chase analyses of the HD mutants correlate with the findings for the WT protein, suggesting the existence of distinct populations of IBV E. we hypothesize that formation of the LMW pool of IBV E during infection may be a regulated event, which would suggest that T16 could take part in this regulatory event during infection. the secretory pathway phenotypes are induced by the fraction of IBV E in the LMW pool. the lack of VLP production by the IBV E-A26F mutant suggests higher-order oligomerization is required for VLP production. the lack of VLP production by the IBV E-T16A mutant suggests that higher-order oligomerization is required for VLP production. the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E has been shown to be a pathogenic determinant in a mouse infection model (20) other viroporins have been shown to have interactions with host and other viral proteins (41). the HIV-1 Vpu1 viroporin has been shown to interact with and induce the degradation of CD4, tetherin, and the tetraspanin protein CD81 (42\u201344). understanding the dynamics of oligomerization, secretory pathway disruption, ion channel activity, and E-protein interactions during infection will help resolve some of the interesting questions posed by this study."}
