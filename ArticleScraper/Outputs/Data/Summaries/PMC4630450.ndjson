{"summary": "surveillance for children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia through the Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) Program. in february 2009, SARI surveillance began in 3 of the 9 provinces of south africa. controls were enrolled from May 2012 at 2 outpatient clinics serving the same population as 2 of the sentinel sites. piratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 10 respiratory viruses (PIV types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; influenza A and B viruses; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; and rhinovirus) when available, HIV-infection status data were obtained through routine standard of care testing at the treating hospital. in our third analysis, we used multinomial regression to compare and contrast demographic and clinical characteristics and severity among patients infected with the 3 PIV types. for the multinomial analysis, we used multinomial regression to compare and contrast demographic and clinical characteristics and severity among patients infected with the 3 PIV types. controls were enrolled from May 2012 at 2 outpatient clinics serving the same population as 2 of the SARI sentinel sites. this surveillance, including testing for influenza and HIV, received human subjects review and ethics approval by the Universities of the Witwatersrand, KwaZulu-Natal, and Pretoria, all of South Africa. we did not test for adenovirus from august to October 2009 because of unavailability of reagents. when not available, HIV testing was implemented at NICD through anonymized, linked dried blood spot specimen testing. data analysis We conducted 3 multivariable logistic regression models. nonsignificant variables were removed from the model one at a time starting with the variables with smallest magnitude of effect. statistical significance was assessed at P.05 for all multivariable models. for each univariate analysis, we used all available case information. 3 (0.3%) tested positive for both types 1 and 2, 13 (1.1%) for types 1 and 3 and 12 (1.0%) for both 2 and 3. males were slightly more likely to test positive for PIV (7.1%, 637 of 9018) than females (5.9%, 540 of 9168, P =.001) a statistically significant AF was seen among both HIV-infected (57.1%; 95% CI, 9.9\u201376.1) and HIV-uninfected individuals of any age (76.1%; 95% CI, 60.9\u201398.7) all agesc 97/1472 (6.6) 28/1538 (1.8) 2.91 (1.89\u20134.48) 65.6 (47.1\u201377.7) HIV-Infected Individualsd 1 6/71 (8.5) 1/24 (4.2) 2.11 (.24\u2013101.72) 52.6 (0\u201399.0) 1\u20134 8/59 (13.6) 6/168 (3.6) 3.91 (1.10\u201314.84) 74.4 (9.1\u201393.3) 5\u201324 1/42 (2.4) the AF was 73.1% (95% CI, 41.2\u201387.8) for PIV type 1, 61.1% (95% CI, 0\u201392.9) for PIV type 2, and 60.3% (95% CI, 33.3\u201376.5) for PIV type 3 separately. the age and HIV-status subgroup analysis results for PIV types 1 and 3 separately were similar to those found for parainfluenza overall. compared with children 5 years of age, individuals 5 years of age with PIV-associated SARI had a higher rate of HIV infection (79.0% [150 of 190] in 5 years and 11.9% [80 of 675] in 5 years, P.001) and higher case/fatality ratio (6.4% [14 of 219] in 5 years and 1.6% [15 of 952] in 5 years, P.001; table 2 and 3).
