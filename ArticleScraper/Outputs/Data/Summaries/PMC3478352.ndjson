{"summary": "influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 25% to 41% across ethnic groups. black and white Canadians have the lowest uptake of influenza vaccine of ethnic groups represented in our study. the survey uses a multistage stratified cluster design that samples 98% of the population. we combined 5 cycles to increase the size of our sample of ethnic groups. the response rate across cycles ranged from 73% to 81%. potential confounders included age, sex, survey cycle, use of health services, immigration status, percentage of years spent in Canada, household income, education, self-perceived health status, living in a jurisdiction with a universal influenza vaccination program during all or most of the study period. we tested highly correlated variables in and out of the saturated model to determine their impact on parameter estimates and on the Akaike information criterion. to minimize the potential for multicollinearity, we removed variables that were highly correlated or resulted in complete separation of data. white, Chinese, South Asian (e.g., Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan), black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian (e.g., Cambodian, Indonesian, Laotian, Vietnamese), Arab (e.g., Egyptian, Lebanese), West Asian (e.g., Afghan, Iranian), Japanese, Korean, Aboriginal (North American Indian [i.e., First Nations], M\u00e9tis, Inuit) and other. we estimated ethnicity-specific influenza vaccine coverage for the overall population, for people aged 65 years and older, and for people aged 12\u201364 years with and without chronic conditions. we also estimated coverage stratified by the presence of a universal influenza vaccination program throughout most of the study period. the survey respondents, weighted to the Canadian population of 26.0 million people aged 12 years and older, by ethnicity (2003\u20132009) Ethnicity, %* Characteristic White Chinese South Asian Aboriginal Black Filipino West Asian/Arab Latin American Southeast Asian Korean Japanese Multiracial/Other Unweighted sample, no. 385 800 7355 5778 19 286 4478 2360 2324 2123 1643 884 614 5843 Weighted population, no.
