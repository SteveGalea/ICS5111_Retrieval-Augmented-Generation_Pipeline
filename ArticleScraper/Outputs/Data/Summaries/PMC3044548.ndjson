{"summary": "Molecular detection methods were used for a subset of outbreaks registered during October 1, 2008\u2013April 19, 2009. intensified tracking of respiratory infection outbreaks in Ontario was undertaken. Specimens from 83 of the 112 outbreaks were tested by the RVP assay. most of the remaining 83 outbreaks submitted for molecular testing originated from LTCFs (91%); hospitals (2%), child care centers (2%) and psychiatric care facilities (1%) comprised the remainder. etiologic agent was identified in 89% of the 161 outbreaks tested by molecular methods. influenza season is delineated as April 20\u2013June 12; influenza season is delineated as October 1\u2013April 19. seven of the 15 outbreaks were confirmed as rhinovirus by the Seeplex RV12 detection kit (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea). 1 patient had a co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus/rhinovirus. coronavirus subtypes 229E and NL63 were the most common. one of the 2 outbreaks identified as caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 originated from a LTCF. respiratory viruses during the 2007\u201308 season may have been more active than those of the 2008\u201309 season because the number of outbreaks registered with PHL decreased from 1 year to the next. the number of outbreaks registered with PHL decreased from 1 year to the next. older persons may have less contact with the age group (children 10\u201319 years of age), with most cases being in Ontario. centers for disease control and prevention guidelines for vaccination with monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine."}
