{"summary": "pharyngeal swabs of 40 cats were sampled (10) on day 8 and tested for H5N1 virus by PCR. positive results were obtained for 3 cats (cats 1, 2, and 3) all positive results were confirmed at the OIE reference laboratory in weybridge, united Kingdom. pharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained and transported in phosphate-buffered saline containing antimicrobial drugs. blood was obtained on days 22, 29, 36, and 50 for all cats at the quarantine station. we obtained 64 additional pharyngeal swabs on day 29 from cats with upper respiratory symptoms. we tested them for nucleic acids specific for feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1)\u2013 and feline calicivirus (FCoV) antigen was detected by using an ELISA (ViraCHEK/FeLV, Synbiotics Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) three dilutions (1:10, 1:100, and 1:400) of each plasma sample were tested for antibodies to group 1 coronaviruses by a modified indirect immunofluorescence assay (15). two cats that seroconverted for H5N1 virus (cats 1 and 4) were humanely killed on day 50. antibodies against influenza virus A H5N1 were detected in 2 cats. cat 1, 2, and 4 had negative test results for FeLV and FIV. all 3 cats had high antibody titers against FCoV. a double infection with FCV and FHV-1 was detected in cat 4. a long (12 hours) and uncomfortable transport to the quarantine area may have caused such a high level of illness. twelve cats died or were humanely killed while in a moribund state between days 22 and 50. no information was reported on the duration of virus shedding. the reason for limited horizontal transmission in our study could be low-level virus shedding by the initially infected cats. the lack of illness would be unusual because several cats in the study had immunodeficiencies caused by other infectious diseases. avian flu in cats is rarely documented and there is no evidence to date that cats are responsible for transmitting the virus to humans. the risk posed by cats could change because the virus can rapidly undergo genetic mutation and reassortment."}
