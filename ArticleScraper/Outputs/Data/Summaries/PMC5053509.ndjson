{"summary": "degradation pathways eliminate aberrant mRNAs, and act to control gene expression levels. mRNAs are typically degraded by the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 cytoplasmic exonuclease, Xrn1 [2,3]. mRNAs can be subject to 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 degradation by the cytoplasmic exosome. RNAs produced by the L-A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lack both a cap structure [23,24] and a poly(A) tail [25], and are vulnerable to degradation by yeast Xrn1 (denoted Xrn1p) [8] and the cytoplasmic exosome [14,26]. 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 degradation of viral RNAs by the cytoplasmic exosome is linked to the action of the SKI complex ( capped viral +ssRNA is encapsidated to form viral particles by interaction with the L-A polymerase protein. packaged +ssRNA is used as a template during negative strand synthesis to produce viral genomic dsRNA. a metric looks for codons that have accumulated a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous mutations (dN) than even synonymous mutations (dS) the signature of dN/dS > 1 commonly results from the repeated cycles of selection that occur in genetic conflict scenarios [33], but has not been shown to be driven by subtler processes. Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae was most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae. Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii was most efficient at controlling the L-A virus. we analyzed each alignment for evidence of codons with dN/dS > 1. only XRN1 and the exosome subunit gene RRP40 passed all four tests. other genes are determined to be under positive selection by some tests. catalytically-dead versions of Xrn1p (E176G and 1206\u20131528) did not suppress L-A dsRNA levels. Xrn1p from S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, or S. bayanus into the S. cerevisiae xrn1 strain. sRNA extraction from S. cerevisiae xrn1 with or without complementation by XRN1 from different species of Saccharomyces (S. cerevisiae; S. mik\u2014S. mikatae; S. kud\u2014S. mikatae; S. kud\u2014S. kudriavzevii; S. bay\u2014S. bayanus) from same agarose gel, the first two lanes were s the killer virus is a satellite dsRNA of L-A that is totally dependent on L-A proteins for replication. it uses L-A-encoded proteins to encapsidate and replicate its genome. the killer virus encodes only a single protein, a secreted toxin referred to as the killer toxin. transformation of xrn1 L-A+ Killer+ with S. cerevisiae XRN1 produced an average kill zone that covered 0.68 cm2 (n = 14) however, transformation with XRN1 from S. mikatae, S. bayanus, or S. kudriavzevii produced significantly larger kill zones covering 0.92 cm2 (n = 11), 0.96 cm2 (n = 17) and 0.97 cm2 (n = 17) XRN1 from all Saccharomyces species have the ability to cure the killer phenotype. over-expression of XRN1 from S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus was unable to cure the killer phenotype. XRN1 orthologs vary in their ability to cure S. cerevisiae. XRN1 orthologs successfully complemented the severe growth defect of S. cerevisiae xrn1 by measuring the doubling time of S. cerevisiae xrn1 with or without a complementing XRN1-containing plasmid. XRN1 homologs convey equal resistance to benomyl on solid medium. 2% galactose was equivalently reduced for strains carrying GAL1 inducible XRN1 genes from each species. 2% galactose was equivalently reduced for strains carrying GAL1 inducible XRN1 genes from each species. Xrn1p is not a restriction factor for Ty retrotransposons, but rather promote their replication. cells are grown on medium containing either raffinose or galactose as the sole carbon source to control the activity of the promoter. XRN1 retrotransposition within S. cerevisiae xrn1 complemented by XRN1 from different species, relative to XRN1 from S. cerevisiae. a structured protein domain within Xrn1p is responsible for species-specific antiviral activity. amino acids 354\u2013503, 979\u20131109, and 1240\u20131528 are unresolved. XRN1 chimera encoding last 775 amino acids from S. cerevisiae was sufficient to cure 56% of clones analyzed. only 9% of clones were cured when the last 777 amino acids were used to replace the same region within S. cerevisiae XRN1. n1p were unable to convey efficient L-A restriction to S. kudriavzevii Xrn1p. we swapped into the D2+D3, D1, or D1-D3 domains of S. cerevisiae Xrn1p. all chimeric XRN1 genes were functionally equivalent with respect to their cellular functions. we introduced epitope tags onto Xrn1p (HA-tag) and the major capsid protein of L-A, Gag (V5-tag), and expressed both tagged and untagged versions of each protein from plasmids introduced into S. cerevisiae xrn1. Xrn1p-HA from both S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii immunoprecipitated Gag-V5. n1p appear similar in all assays, which seems at odds with our model that suggests evolutionary differences within Xrn1p are a direct determinant of totivirus interaction. first, there may be a third component in this interaction which makes manifest the species-specificity of Xrn1p. a new totivirus from S. cerevisiae has been shown to have limited susceptibility to XRN1 from a different strain of S. cerevisiae [28] we also wanted to test viruses of other species, but the only fully characterized totiviruses within the Saccharomyces genus are from S. cerevisiae. phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide and protein sequences firmly places SkV-L-A1 within the clade of Saccharomyces totiviruses represented by L-A and L-A-lus [28,63], as opposed to the more distantly related Saccharomyces totivirus L-BC. the major product of the extraction method is a single 4.6 kbp dsRNA species. the exact phylogenetic relationship of the \u201cL-A-like\u201d viruses is somewhat ambiguous due to low bootstrap support within the clade. S. kudriavzevii was used to express XRN1 from different Saccharomyces yeasts. plasmids expressing XRN1 orthologs were introduced via LiAc transformation into S. kudriavzevii infected with SkV-L-A1. heterospecific XRN1 were expressed within S. kudriavzevii and analyzed for their ability to spontaneously cure SkV-L-A1. we did not observe any virus curing by any orthologs of Xrn1p. but we believe that this could be because the high-copy plasmids that we used in this experiment in S. cerevisiae are unable to drive Xrn1p high enough to actually cure the virus. S. cerevisiae XRN1 was able to reduce SkV-L-A1 RNAs by 27%. this is in contrast to XRN1 from S. mikatae (n = 9) and S. bayanus (n = 8) that only showed a 13% increase or 15% decrease in SkV-L-A1 RNAs. this is due to the close evolutionary relationship between SkV-L-A1 and other L-A-like viruses from S XRN1 and the exosome subunit gene RRP40 passed all four tests. other genes are determined to be under positive selection by some tests. the impact of XRN1 on viral replication has been more directly substantiated. Xrn1p from S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, or S. bayanus was capable of slightly reducing L-A dsRNA abundance. Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae appears to have levels of dsRNA similar to xrn1. dsRNA extraction from S. cerevisiae xrn1 expressing wild type XRN1 (E176G) or truncation mutants of Xrn1p (all derived from S. cerevisiae) the effect of Xrn1p expression on the diameter of the kill zones around killer yeast. killer virus encodes only a single protein, a secreted toxin referred to as the killer toxin. resistance to the killer toxin is provided by the pre-processed, immature form of the toxin, supplying killer yeast cells with an antidote to their own poison. transformation with XRN1 from S. mikatae, S. bayanus, or S. kudriavzevii produced significantly larger kill zones covering 0.92 cm2 (n = 11), 0.96 cm2 (n = 17) and 0.97 cm2 (n = 17) the smaller kill zones in the strain expressing S. cerevisiae XRN1 are consistent with lower levels of killer and L-A derived RNAs. copy of S. cerevisiae XRN1 cured 49% of clones (n = 159). over-expression of XRN1 from S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus was unable to cure the killer phenotype. loss of L-A from cured strains was also verified by RT-PCR. non-quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm loss of L-A and killer RNAs from strains deemed to have lost the killer phenotype from Fig 3A and 3B. XRN1 orthologs successfully complemented the severe growth defect of S. cerevisiae xrn1 by measuring the doubling time of XRN1 with or without a complementing XRN1-containing plasmid. Xrn1p is not a restriction factor for Ty retrotransposons, but rather promotes their replication. no significant difference between mean values for retrotransposition in the presence of Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, or S. bayanus. Xrn1p housekeeping functions have been conserved during yeast speciation. xrn1 retrotransposition within S. cerevisiae xrn1 complemented by XRN1 from different species, relative to XRN1 from S. cerevisiae. error bars represent SEM, n>3. modeled domains contained three of the residue positions that we identified as evolving under positive selection. structural model of S. cerevisiae Xrn1p generated by Phyre analysis. amino acids 354\u2013503, 979\u20131109, and 1240\u20131528 unresolved. a killer S. cerevisiae strain expressing chimeric Xrn1p were assayed for their ability to cure the killer phenotype from S. cerevisiae. we replaced portions of S. kudriavzevii XRN1 with the equivalent portions of S. cerevisiae XRN1 and assayed for a region of S. cerevisiae XRN1 that would convey the ability to cure the killer chimeric XRN1 genes were functionally equivalent with respect to their cellular functions. Xrn1p targets uncapped viral RNA transcripts rather than affecting dsRNA propagation. Xrn1p targets uncapped viral RNA transcripts. the major capsid protein of L-A, Gag (V5-tag) expressed both tagged and untagged versions of each protein from plasmids introduced into S. cerevisiae xrn1. bead-bound antibodies specific for either HA or V5 were used to immunoprecipitate Xrn1p. g may be antagonizing Xrn1p rather than being the species-specific target of Xrn1p. a trivial explanation could be that coimmunoprecipitations are not very quantitative. a previously undescribed interaction that goes beyond Xrn1p interaction with viral RNA. iavzevii screened a 4.6 kbp dsRNA molecule within the genus of Saccharomyces. we cloned the 4.6 kbp dsRNA molecule using techniques described by potgieter et al. [62]. dsRNA extraction from different species of Saccharomyces yeasts. the major product of the extraction method is a single 4.6 kbp dsRNA species. a schematic representation of the genome organization of the totivirus. S. kudriavzevii was used to express HA-tagged XRN1 from different Saccharomyces yeasts. expression measured by Western blotting relative to expression of ADH1. plasmids expressing XRN1 orthologs were introduced via LiAc transformation into S. kudriavzevii. cDNA samples were amplified using random hexamer priming. expression of XRN1 from S. kudriavzevii (n = 10) reduced relative levels of SkV-L-A1 RNAs by 40%. expression of XRN1 from S. mikatae (n = 9) reduced relative levels of SkV-L-A1 RNAs by 40%. Xrn1p is a species-specific restriction factor in different Saccharomyces yeasts. Xrn1p, the SKI complex, and exosome are all important for controlling the abundance of totivirus RNAs. the totivirus Gag protein has a cap-snatching activity that cleaves off caps from host mRNAs and uses them to cap viral transcripts. we have found that Xrn1p interacts with L-A Gag, and that this interaction is not mediated by the presence of single-stranded RNAs. we cannot clearly define the observed role of sequence variation in Xrn1p by coimmunoprecipitation. Xrn1p has been reported to have activity against mammalian viruses [9,16], yeast viruses [8,24], and plant viruses [46]. the potent 5\u2019-3\u2019 exonuclease activity of Xrn1p has resulted in viruses developing a rich diversity of strategies to protect their RNAs. Xrn1p degradation, Xrn1p relocalization, virus-encoded capping enzymes, cap-snatching mechanisms, RNA-protein conjugation, recruitment of host micro-RNAs, and viral RNA pseudoknots are all used to prevent Xrn1p-mediated viral RNA destruction. if an infected yeast cell can kill other yeasts around it using the killer toxin, it no longer has to compete for resources within that environmental niche there is a measurable fitness cost to killer toxin production by S. cerevisiae. a virus of the fungi Cryphonectria parasitica has been shown to antagonize and escape restriction by RNAi without crippling its host. a virus of the fungi Cryphonectria parasitica has been shown to antagonize and escape restriction by RNAi. several mammalian housekeeping proteins engaged in evolutionary arms races with viruses. many viruses hijack cell surface receptors to assist replication in the cell. Xrn1p appears to be an antiviral protein, but must evolve new antiviral specificities. pAG425-GAL-ccdB was amplified by PCR to produce a 5000 bp product lacking the GAL-1 gene and the ccdB cassette. both PCR products were used to transform BY4741, with correctly assembled plasmids selected for by growth on complete medium (CM)\u2013leucine. XRN1 genes were sub-cloned into the destination vector pAG426-GAL-ccdB. the same pCR8/Gateway workflow was also used to clone and tag GAG from a cDNA copy of the L-A totivirus (pI2L2) to produce pPAR330 and pPAR331. Strains of S. kudriavzevii and S. mikatae were grown at room temperature. all other strains were grown at 30\u00b0C. cell pellet was used as an approximate measure of cell number relative to S. cerevisiae. centrifugation at 16,000 x g for an additional 30 sec. dsRNA was eluted from the column by the addition of 100 l of 0.15 mM EDTA (pH 7.0) and incubation at 65\u00b0C for 5 min before centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 30 sec. cDNA was created using a primer specific for the negative strand L-A genomic RNA. primers were used to detect L-A and killer virus specific cDNAs. we assayed Ty1 retrotransposition in S. cerevisiae xrn1 using the previously described Ty1 retrotransposition reporter system. multiple protein sequence alignments were created using tools available from the EMBL. protein alignments were manually curated to remove ambiguities before processing with PAL2NAL to produce accurate DNA alignments. GARD analysis found no significant evidence of homologous recombination within any dataset. MEGA6 was used to infer the evolutionary history of totiviruses using the Maximum Likelihood method. YPD \u201ckiller assay\u201d agar plate supplemented with methylene blue (final concentration 0.003% w/v) and pH balanced to 4.2 with sodium citrate were freshly inoculated and spread with S. cerevisiae K12. 1.5 l of water containing 6 x 105 cells was spotted onto seeded YPD plates and incubated at room temperature for 72 h. co-immunoprecipitation of Xrn1p and L-A Gag Strains was grown in CM lacking the appropriate amino acids in order to retain the relevant plasmids. cells were harvested at OD600 0.7, after 14 h of growth at 30\u00b0C. RNAse is in excess in co-IP experiments because RNA degradation occurred at concentrations of RNase 8-fold lower than we used.
