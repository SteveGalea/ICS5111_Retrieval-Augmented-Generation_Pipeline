{"summary": "ebolavirus particles attach to cells through the binding of their glycoprotein (GP) to cell surface receptors or lectins, such as TIM-1 and DC-SIGN, expressed on the plasma membrane (1, 22, 27, 29, 37) membrane-bound particles are taken up into cells by a macropinocytosis-like mechanism and transported to late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/LY) (20, 30, 31, 34), which contain essential entry host factors. cleaved, but not uncleaved, GP1 binds to purified LE/LY membranes in an NPC1-dependent manner and coimmunoprecipitates with NPC1 (10). we identified small molecules that target NPC1, inhibit infection, and block the binding of cleaved GP1 to NPC1-containing membranes. this suggests that the conserved N-terminal domain of GP1 is a ligand for NPC1. plasmids for mouse cathepsin B, mouse cathepsin L, EBOV-May GP, and mucin deletion-containing (Muc) were obtained from Anthony Sanchez (CDC) and subcloned into pCAGGS. PCR added a silent XbaI site at the site of the deletion in each GP. Chimeric EBOV-May GP1/Reston ebolavirus GP2 and Reston ebolavirus GP2/EBOV-May GP2 were created by restriction digestion of the parental plasmids with XbaI. the fragments were gel purified and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs) flow cytometry was used to determine the relative ratio of infected to uninfected cathepsin B/ cathepsin L+/+ MEF cells. cells were transfected using 4 g total DNA and 10 l Lipofectamine 2000. cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fresh medium containing 10% FBS was added. 8,000 cells were added to each well of a 48-well dish. a pseudotyped VSV encoding luciferase (VSVluc) was added at dilutions within the linear range of infection. cells were lysed using standard conditions for the firefly luciferase kit (Promega) psin B and L activity in cathepsin B/ cathepsin L+/+ and wild-type MEF cells were confirmed. the presence of similar levels of cathepsin L activity in cathepsin B/ cathepsin L/ MEF cells was confirmed. VSVluc particles bearing mucin domain deletion-containing GPs from the indicated ebolaviruses were digested in the presence or absence of chymotrypsin. after 1 h, the digestion was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mM. aved SUDV GPTM was created by incubation in the presence of chymotrypsin in chymotrypsin reaction buffer. after 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail. final PCR product was cloned into pCAGGS MCS using NsiI and XhoI. plasmid was restricted with KpnI and religated to create mucin deletion-containing BDBV. clone was verified by sequencing. plasmids for mouse cathepsin B, mouse cathepsin L, EBOV-May GP, and mucin deletion-containing (Muc) EBOV-May GP were described previously (7). mucin plasmids were encoding ebolavirus Cote d'Ivoire GP, ebolavirus Sudan-Boniface GP, ebolavirus Reston-Pennsylvani EBOV-May and Reston ebolavirus muc mutations were made using site-directed PCR mutagenesis. the sequences of the primers used were 5\u2032-CTCTAGAGCCTCTCTCTGCTAACCA, 5\u2032CATTACAGGTTAGTGAAGTCGACAAACTAGTTTGT, 5\u2032-GTCGACTTCACTAACCTGTAATGT, 5\u2032-TCAATATCTGTTGCTTTGAGAGT. two-color flow cytometry was used to determine the relative ratio of infected to uninfected cathepsin B/ cathepsin L+/+ MEF cells. cells were cotransfected with an mRFP-expressing plasmid and a sham plasmid, mouse cathepsin B, or mouse cathepsin L. after 4 h, cells were transfected using 4 g total DNA and 10 l Lipo twenty-four hours after the addition of the virus, cells were lysed using standard conditions for the firefly luciferase kit (Promega) protease inhibitors E-64, E-64d, and CA074 (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dispensed into culture medium immediately before use. after 1 h, the virus inoculums were removed by washing and fresh medium containing E64d or vehicle was added. ebolavirus NP RNA was measured using a standard curve obtained using a virus stock of known titer. virus particles were deglycosylated by overnight incubation in the presence of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England BioLabs) GP1 digestion products were analyzed using immunoblot assay against a conserved N-terminal region of ebolavirus GP1 using polyclonal rabbit anti-ebolavirus GP1 antibody. LE/LY were disrupted by incubation with methionine methyl ester (Sigma) and used to coat high-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates. unbound GPTM protein was removed, membranes were washed, and membrane-bound GPTM protein was recovered in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblot assay using GP1 antiserum. plasmid was restricted with KpnI and religated to create mucin deletion-containing BDBV. RESULTS Endosomal cysteine proteases are host factors for filovirus entry. previous studies show that EBOV-May infection is reduced by >99% by E-64. the results were confirmed in studies of viruses bearing GPs lacking the mucin-rich domain in GP1. the production of new virus was reduced by more than 99% in the presence of E-64d. infection by EBOV-May, ebolavirus Sudan-Gulu, and lake Victoria marburgvirus Musoke in vero cells was reduced by more than 99%. after 3 days, the titer was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. data are means of three wells SD (n = 3) after 72 h copies of the viral L gene per cell were determined. analysis of the amino acid sequences of GPs from EBOV-May suggests that the domain structures of GP1 and GP2 are conserved. RESTV removes the carboxyl-terminal domains of GP1 to create an N-terminal 18- to 20-kDa fragment. we analyzed the function of chymotrypsin-cleaved virus particles on CHO cells. they are infectious and dependent on both NPC1 and cysteine protease activity. NPC1 or treated with chymotrypsin-cleaved muc GP from EBOV-May, CIEBOV, SUDV, RESTV, or VSV. after 16 h, infection was measured in RLU. GP infection was not as sensitive to CA074 inhibition as EBOV-May or CIEBOV GP. neither RESTV nor MARV GP-mediated infection was significantly reduced when cathepsin B activity was inhibited. data presented were determined as follows: (infection [IU/ml] of cathepsin B-deficient cells)/(infection of wild-type MEF cells) 100%. showsn is a representative of three independent experiments. cathepsin L is an E-64-sensitive endopeptidase that is expressed in cells expressing cathepsin B (15, 17, 32, 40, 42, 43) infection of vero cells treated with the inhibitor FYdmk was reduced when concentration of FYdmk exceeded >1 M. cathepsin B and L activities were determined by fluorogenic substrates (n = 2). after 24 h, GFP-positive cells were manually counted using fluorescence microscopy. infectivities from two replicates are shown. infectivity was determined by measuring the RLU in cell lysates. data are means SD (n = 6) in cathepsin-transfected cells. expression of cathepsin L is not a substitute for the essential role of cathepsin B in EBOV-May and CIEBOV infections. expression of either cathepsin L or cathepsin B enhanced the RESTV infection of cathepsin B/ cathepsin L/ MEF cells. RESTV-GP1/EBOV-GP2 particles on vero cells were similar to RESTV. the titer of RESTV-GP1/EBOV-GP2 particles was similar to that of RESTV-May. the determinants of cathepsin B dependence are not localized exclusively within either GP1 or GP2. RESTV was incubated in the presence of CA074 (80 M), E-64 (300 M) for 3 h. infectivity was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. cathepsin B dependence of EBOV-May maps to residues D47 and I584. GPs of EBOV-May and CIEBOV are cathepsin B dependent, but not in those of SUDV and MARV (N47 and L584). analysis of the BDBV sequence revealed the presence of D47 and I584, thus predicting that BDBV is cathepsin B dependent. infection by BDBV GP particles was inhibited by increasing concentrations of CA074 (0 to 80 M) in a pattern closely correlated with that of EBOV-May. increased concentrations of CA074 (0 to 80 M) or the vehicle for 3 h prior to the addition of VSVluc particles bearing Muc GP from EBOV-May (Z), BDBV (B), or RESTV (R) after 6 h, cells were lysed and relative luminescence (RLU) was measured. infection by EBOV-May, ebolavirus Sudan-Gulu, and lake Victoria marburgvirus Musoke in vero cells was reduced by more than 99% in the presence of E-64d. the production of new virus was reduced by more than 99% in the presence of E-64d, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. after 3 days, the titer was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. data are means of three wells SD (n = 3). copies of the viral L gene per cell were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. analysis of amino acid sequences of GPs from EBOV-May suggests that the domain structures of GP1 and GP2 are conserved. SUDV removes the carboxyl-terminal domains of GP1 to create an N-terminal 18- to 20-kDa fragment. we analyzed the function of chymotrypsin-cleaved virus particles on CHO cells. they are infectious and dependent on both NPC1 and cysteine protease activity. CHO cells were challenged with VSV particles encoding luciferase (VSVluc) and bearing GPs from uncleaved or chymotrypsin-cleaved Muc GP from EBOV-May, CIEBOV, SUDV, RESTV, or VSV. infection was measured in RLU after 16 h. SUDV GP infection was not as sensitive to CA074 inhibition as EBOV-May or CIEBOV GP. neither RESTV nor MARV GP-mediated infection was significantly reduced. cathepsin B is not an essential host factor for all filoviruses. data presented were determined as follows: (infection [IU/ml] of cathepsin B-deficient cells)/(infection of wild-type MEF cells) 100%. showsn is a representative of three independent experiments. cathepsin L is an E-64-sensitive endopeptidase that is expressed in cells expressing cathepsin B (15, 17, 32, 40, 42, 43) infection of vero cells treated with the inhibitor FYdmk was reduced. cathepsin B and L activities were determined by fluorogenic substrates. after 24 h, GFP-positive cells were manually counted using fluorescence microscopy. infectivities from two replicates are shown and are representative of four independent experiments. infectivity was determined by measuring the RLU in cell lysates. data are means SD (n = 6). showsn is representative of four independent experiments. expression of cathepsin L is not a substitute for the essential role of cathepsin B in EBOV-May and CIEBOV infections. expression of either cathepsin L or cathepsin B enhanced the RESTV infection of cathepsin B/ cathepsin L/ MEF cells. RESTV-GP1/RESTV-GP2 particles on vero cells were similar to RESTV. the titer of RESTV-GP1/EBOV-GP2 particles was similar to that of RESTV. the findings indicate that the determinants of cathepsin B dependence are not localized exclusively within either GP1 or GP2. infectivity was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. infectivity was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. cathepsin B dependence of EBOV-May maps to residues D47 and I584. GPs of EBOV-May and CIEBOV are cathepsin B dependent, but not in those of SUDV and MARV (N47 and L584). c fever occurred in Uganda due to a filovirus that is sufficiently different from EBOV, CIEBOV, RESTV, and MARV. analysis of the BDBV sequence revealed the presence of D47 and I584, thus predicting that BDBV is cathepsin B dependent. infection by BDBV GP particles was blocked by the treatment of cells with E-64 and in cathepsin B/ MEF cells. in the presence of increasing concentrations of CA074 (0 to 80 M) or the vehicle for 3 h prior to the addition of VSVluc particles bearing Muc GP from EBOV-May (Z), BDBV (B), or RESTV (R), cells were lysed and relative luminescence (RLU) was measured. a model of infection based on this progress has been proposed (10). new findings show that as in EBOV-May, the carboxyl-terminal domain of SUDV GP1 is a substrate for proteolytic cleavage, that cleaved particles are infectious and NPC1 dependent. the protease-resistant N-terminal domain of GP1 binds to purified LE/LY membranes in an NPC1-dependent manner. endosomal cysteine proteases are a family of 11 acid-dependent proteases that reside in LE/LY (15, 17, 32, 40\u201343) little is known about the roles individual members of this family play during filovirus infection. EBOV-May requires cathepsin B, but not cathepsin L, for entry (7). the presence of multiple proteases with overlapping substrate preferences in late endosomes and lysosomes of host cells may provide for redundancy in the conditions for cleavage of GP. this scheme may explain the virus-specific differences in dependence on cathepsins B and L observed in our studies."}
