{"summary": "infected subjects release a wide size range of particles during breathing, coughing, sneezing, and talking. exhaled breath of seven subjects infected with influenza was collected on Teflon filters and exhaled particle concentrations measured using an optical particle counter. the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for N95 FFRs is 50 nm (electrical mobility diameter) in the case of SMs, both electrostatic and mechanical types are available. SMs are fit-tested before use in workplaces whereas SMs are not. test aerosol size was assumed to be about 0.1\u20130.3 m based on the comparison of the filtration efficiency obtained for N95 FFRs and SMs in their study. results showed both N95 FFRs and SMs gave 95% or greater filtration efficiency, and N95 FFRs had about 2% filtration efficiency higher than the SMs. both SMs and N95 FFRs were significantly effective in reducing the risk of SARS infection among staff. SMs will have a larger faceseal leakage than SMs when used by workers. the difference in face-fitting characteristics is to measure the TIL under controlled leak sizes. two N95 FFR models and two SM models were tested in the study. the SM models were: Primed (model PG4-1073,) and 3M (model 1800) labeled as SM1 and SM2 respectively. none of the models tested in the study had exhalation valves. a silicone sealant sealed to a manikin head form using a silicone sealant. the head form was connected to a breathing simulator through an isolation chamber. a metal tube (2.5 cm diameter) from the back of the mouth was connected to an inflatable rubber bladder, which mimics a human lung. excess aerosol exited through a hole (1.3 cm diameter) in the back of the test chamber. a small fan was installed at the bottom of the chamber to ensure an even distribution of particles throughout. a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was equipped with a sample probe to measure aerosol concentration inside the FFR. two SMPS systems scanned the particles in the 20\u2013800 nm size range three times each three min. samples were withdrawn simultaneously during manikin breathing at 8 and 40 L minute volumes with tidal volumes of 0.5 and 1.5 L. a Plexiglas test box (L 20 cm W 20 cm H 10 cm) with a hole (2.5 cm diameter) in the center was used for measuring penetration. a silicone sealant was used to seal the top and bottom plates to make the Plexiglas box airtight. the back of the mouth was connected to an inflatable rubber bladder. the breathing simulator allows air to go back and forth into the glass container. in response, ambient air enters the bladder through the FFR sealed to the manikin head form during inhalation and exits during exhalation. so, the isolation chamber prevented particles created by the breathing simulator pump from getting inside the breathing zone. size monodisperse particles (20\u2013800 nm, electrical mobility diameter) over 240 sec and repeated after a 30 sec interval, using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) with a long differential mobility analyzer (DMA), and an ultra-fine condensation particle counter (UCPC, TSI 3776) the test aerosols were filled with non-hardening putty. RESULTS Filter Efficiency NaCl aerosol penetrations for N95 FFR models were lower than the penetrations for the SM models at 85 L/min flow rate. penetrations for N1 and SM1 were relatively lower than the values obtained for N2 and SM2 respectively. 0.1 1.482.1 1.010.3 3.581.5 2.911.5 45.0820 87.5528 40 1.560.9 0.310.2 4.962.9 2.551.9 9.332.4 2.272.1 68.4414 96.5910 Two 3 mm 8 10.674.6 9.943.1 11.527.7 10.141.6 14.765.1 9.7010.3 67.017.0 100.0395 40 8.563.1 8.452.4 11.754.6 9.141.6 14.023.8 9.253.95 71.576.1 99 particle size (MPPS) was 45 nm for both FFR models. the MPPS was 45 nm with no leaks and with a smaller leak size (23 mm), which can be seen at 40 L/min. SM2 showed higher TIL values for 45 nm particles than for 300 nm size particles at smaller leak sizes as reported previously. for SM2, TIL values were smaller at 45 nm than at 300 nm at all test conditions. N1 and SM1 are described as higher-efficiency FFR and SM models. based on the penetration values, N1 and SM1 are described as higher-efficiency FFR and SM models, respectively, throughout the article. the size distribution of NaCl aerosol used for TIL measurement showed a CMD of 82 nm and a mode size (peak size) of 75 nm. the most penetrating particle size was 45 nm for both FFR models. the symbols indicate sealed with no leaks (\u2022), two 1.18 mm leaks () and two 1.80 mm leaks. the solid vertical line corresponds to the mode of the challenge aerosol (75 nm) larger leak holes (43 mm and 63 mm) tend to produce similar TIL values for different size particles. symbols indicate sealed with no leaks (\u2022), two 3 mm leaks (), four 3 mm leaks () and six 3 mm leaks (). the solid vertical line corresponds to the approximate MPPS (45 nm) of the two surgical models SM1 and SM2 at 8 L/min and 40 L/min breathing minute volume. the results can be explained by the large difference in filter efficiency between the filtering devices (FFRs and SM1 vs. SM2) and the inverse relationship between efficiency and TIL. the results are consistent with the data for four different N95 FFR models tested previously. filter penetration and faceseal leakage may influence the TIL of different size particles. results are consistent with previous finding() that faceseal leakage acts as a gatekeeper. filter penetration or filter media characteristic assigns the TIL values for different size particles. five different N95 FFR models with different filter efficiencies were tested on 35 human subjects performing the oSHA fit-testing exercises. a portaCount Pro (TSI, Shorewood, Minn.) measured the Cout /Cin ratio which was then converted to TIL values based on the relationship between the two parameters. tested with 100 nm diameter non-neutralized polystyrene latex spheres (PSL) at 1 to 25 cm/sec face velocity. SMs are expected to show lower TIL values than do SMs. limitations include the small number of N95 FFR and SM models tested for TIL measurement. additional models, including those equipped with an exhalation valve, need to be tested to obtain conclusive information on filter efficiency dependence of TIL. a manikin setup showed a MPPS of 45 nm for N95 FFR models N1 and N2 and SM1 models, and 350 nm for the SM2 model at different flow rates and leak sizes. higher-efficiency N95 and SM models showed lower TIL values than lower-efficiency models, indicating potential influence of filter efficiency."}
