{"summary": "eukaryotic cellular mRNAs and viral mRNAs contain a modified 5\u2032-terminal \u201ccap\u201d structure that is essential for efficient splicing, nuclear export, translation, and stability of the mRNAs (1, 2). the cap structures are usually formed by three sequential enzymatic reactions: the 5\u2032-triphosphate end of the nascent mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase (TPas coronaviruses have the largest and most complex genome (27 to 31 kb of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA) among RNA viruses. many of them are identified as important pathogens of humans and animals, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8). coronavirus GTase is linked with a unique 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain in nsp14. the functional domain of coronavirus is different from that of other viral MTases which can execute their MTase activity independently from other functional domains on the same protein. nsp14 mutants were cloned into yeast vector pMceK294A (2m, TRP1). cloned mutants are fused in frame with an N-terminal leader peptide. yeast strain YBS40 carries a deletion at the chromosomal Abd1 locus encoding the yeast cap MTase (25) mutants of nsp14 were generated as described for yeast screening plasmids. expression gave rise to recombinant proteins with an N-terminal 6His tag. protein was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl -d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16\u00b0C for 12 to 16 h. clease P1 (which cleaves capped RNAs into 3\u2032-OH-terminated cap structures and 5\u2032-pNOH) were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose-F plates (Merck) for thin-layer chromatography. methylated cap structure (m7G*pppA) could be readily separated from nonmethylated cap structure (G*pppA) denosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine (67.3 Ci/mmol, 0.5 Ci/l) were pipetted into wells of a microtiter plate. the reaction mixtures were incubated on ice and irradiated with 254-nm UV light. the samples were then analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. mutants of nsp14 of SARS-CoV were generated by overlap PCR with mutagenic primers from SARS-CoV strain WHU (24) the cloned mutants are fused in frame with an N-terminal leader peptide (MGSHHHHHHSGHMRI) and the C-terminal mouse capping enzyme Mce1 with an inactivating K294A mutation. mutants of nsp14 were generated as described for yeast screening plasmids. expression gave rise to recombinant proteins with an N-terminal 6His tag. protein was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl -d-thiogalactopyranoside. ed with 5 g of nuclease P1 (which cleaves capped RNAs into 3\u2032-OH-terminated cap structures and 5\u2032-pNOH) were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose-F plates (Merck) for thin-layer chromatography. the methylated cap structure (m7G*pppA) could be readily separated from nonmethylated cap structure (G*pppA) reaction mixtures were incubated on ice and irradiated with 254-nm UV light. gels were soaked in Enlightning solution (Perkin-Elmer) and used for fluorography. the bonds between nsp14 and SAM were calculated with Discovery studio2.1. the final images were presented with PyMOL.

for complementing yeast growth corresponds to the activity of nsp14 N7-MTase. truncation of the N-terminal 61 aa, which are outside the core domain of ExoN, did not impair the N7-MTase function in cells. this increased the enzymatic activity in biochemical assays compared with that of wild-type nsp14. the markers m7G*pppA (lane 6) and G*pppA (lane 7) were prepared with commercial vaccinia virus capping enzymes. the positions of origin and migration of m7G*pppA and G*pppA are indicated on the left. analysis of ExoN activity of wild-type nsp14, nsp14 mutants, and truncations in 10% urea-PAGE using single-stranded RNA deletions at the same sites disabled the N7-MTase activity. these results suggest that the global structure rather than the specific amino acids at the ExoN active site is important for the MTase activity. the ratios of digestion products to input RNA within each lane were quantitated. the global structure of aa 62 to 527 of nsp14 is essential for both N7-MTase and ExoN activities. 60 mutations mainly with alanine substitutions for 57 amino acid residues from aa 61 to aa 523 of nsp14 were generated. residues corresponding to those identified in temperature-sensitive

and C414) were previously identified from the MHV ts strains. cherichia coli cells purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. the results are shown in Fig. 2 and are also summarized in Table 2. treatment of G*pppA-RNAs with nsp14 mutants K61A, F73A, N256A, and D273A resulted in nuclease P1 cleavage products that comigrated with m7G*pppA. se activities of 10 nsp14 mutants were attenuated, causing incomplete conversion from G*pppA-RNA to m7G*pppA-RNA. the nsp14 mutants D352A and N388A were lethal in the yeast genetic system. a discrepancy was observed in biochemical and genetic assays. the ratios of conversion of G*pppA to m7G*pppA are shown at the bottom. we also tested the nsp14 mutants in another biochemical system. the reaction products were purified and quantified by liquid scintillation. the results are in accord with those obtained in TLC analysis. 3H-labeled SAM was incubated with the nsp14 mutants. nsp14 mutants abolished the SAM-binding activity of nsp14. nsp14 mutants retained partial SAM-binding ability. mutant T428A showed the same SAM-binding capacity as wild-type nsp14. but was lethal in yeast cells at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. mutants (F73A, D243A, H268L, and C382Y) attenuated the SAM-binding affinity (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 7, 9, and 13) but sustained high enzymatic activities both in cells and in the in vitro assay. mutant P335A possessed weak SAM-binding capacity (Fig. 3) but retained relatively high enzymatic activity both in vivo and in vitro. mutations at the nonconserved residues did not disrupt either the SAM-binding capacities of nsp14 (Fig. 3B, lanes 8, 11, and 15) or the enzymatic activities of N7-MTase. coronavirus nsp14 was modeled by homologous modeling on the basis of the structure of a cellular mRNA cap N7-MTase. the ligand SAM lies at the C termini of strands 1 and 2 similar to that of most SAM-dependent MTases. the experimentally confirmed critical residues within 5 from SAM are shown in Fig. 4B. the carbonyl O atom of the methionine moiety of SAM has two polar contacts with the side chain carboxyl group of D331. based on the model, these residues are located at the bottom of the SAM-binding pocket. the residues such as D331 and G333 in the DxG motif are critical for SAM-binding and enzymatic activities of nsp14. the pocket consists of the flexible loop 401-410 as the right flanking wall. the loop 381-386 as one part of the long flexible region 380-397 between strands 3 and 4. it is conceivable that the conformation and stability of the pocket may affect the SAM-binding affinity. truncations of 78 amino acids (aa) from the N terminus (nsp14N78) and 6 aa from C terminus (nsp14C6) of nsp14 already attenuated the MTase activity dramatically. truncations of 90 aa from the N terminus (nsp14N90) and 17 aa from C terminus (nsp14C17) completely abolished the MTas the ability of nsp14 mutants for complementing yeast growth corresponds to the activity of nsp14 N7-MTase. the truncation of the N-terminal 61 aa, which are outside the core domain of ExoN, did not impair the N7-MTase function in cells, but instead increased the activity in biochemical assays. 85% of the RNA substrate was methylated by nsp14N61 within 5 min. incubation for 30 min yielded entirely methylated RNA substrate. this indicates that the N7-MTase activity of nsp14N61 is remarkably higher than that of wild-type nsp14. the values on the y axis indicate the ratios of digestion products to input RNA within each lane. input RNA represents digestion products plus undigested full-length substrate. we further generated a set of internal deletion mutants of nsp14 by removing 1- to 5-aa stretches inside the N-terminal ExoN domain. these deletion mutants were analyzed in the yeast genetic system at 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C. aa 62 to 527 of nsp14 is essential for both N7-MTase and ExoN activities. terminal truncations (N61 and C17) and active-site mutations of both ExoN and MTase (D331A) were tested. 57 amino acid residues from aa 61 to aa 523 of SARS-CoV nsp14 were generated. we chose the residues for mutation based on the following rules: (i) the most conserved residues revealed in the primary sequence alignment of coronaviral nsp14. ++ ++ 97 G68A 68 +++ +++ ++ ND F73A 73 ++ ++ ++ ++ 91 T75A 75 +++ +++ ++ ++ ND V83A 83 +++ ++ ++ ++ ND R84A 84 6

the growth status of yeast cells on the selection medium is correlated with the N7-MTase activities of nsp14 and its mutants. the critical residues are clustered mainly at aa 331 to 336 and aa 414 to 428. the second region, ranging from aa 73 to 86, is located at the N terminus of the ExoN domain. the identification of critical residues of N7-MTase from the ExoN domain reinforces a role of the ExoN domain in the N7-MTase enzymatic function. migrated with m7G*pppA (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 17), indicating that these four mutations did not significantly affect the N7-MTase activity of nsp14. treatment of G*pppA-RNAs with nsp14 mutants R84A, W86A, R310A, D331A, D331Y, G333A, Y368A, C414R, L419A, and nsp14 mutants retained 47% and 83% of N7-MTase activity in biochemical assays. this discrepancy could be explained by the high concentrations of SAM and GpppA-RNA included in the cap methylation reaction mixtures in the in vitro assays. this could be explained by changes of protein stability or localization in yeast cells. two sets of biochemical assays of the nsp14 mutants consolidated the findings in the genetic assays. the nsp14 mutants did not affect the activity of N7-MTase of nsp14. glutamate could replace conserved aspartate (D331E) and enhanced the SAM-binding activity of nsp14. but it attenuated the enzymatic activity of the N7-MTase and reduced viability of yeast cells. mutant T428A showed the same SAM-binding capacity as wild-type nsp14. aa 331 to 333 of nsp14 is involved in the SAM binding of coronavirus nsp14. residues W86, R310, and Y368 are also essential for SAM binding of nsp14. mutant P335A possessed weak SAM-binding capacity. insertion into the DxG site abolished the SAM-binding ability (Fig. 3B) and inactivated the N7-MTase activity (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the structural patterning of the SAM-binding motif or distance between the critical residues is more important than the properties of the specific residues. the ligand SAM lies at the C termini of strands 1 and 2 similar to that of most SAM-dependent MTases. the experimentally confirmed critical residues within 5 from SAM are shown in Fig. 4B. nsp14 is shown as surface (C) and surface with 40% transparency (D) nsp14 is colored in cyan, nsp14 is colored in orange, loop 381-386 is colored in green, loop 354-357 is colored in blue. the model suggests why mutations in these loops disrupted or attenuated the activity of nsp14 N7-MTase. in previous studies, SARS-CoV nsp14 was shown to possess 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (20, 21, 39) and N7-MTase activity (19) the critical residues for MTase activity are shown inside the domain boxes of nsp14 (with residue positions above the boxes) the boxed residues indicate the conserved motif I (SAM-binding site) and motif II of the MTase. all amino acids are mutated to alanine except H268L, C414R, and G416R. a large portion of nsp14 (aa 62 to 527) is essential for full activity of both N7-MTase and ExoN. deletions of even a few amino acid residues throughout the N-terminal ExoN domain could abolish the activity of N7-MTase. the function of the N7-MTase is also strongly dependent on the ExoN domain structure on the same polypeptide. two critical residues (R84 and W86) were identified at the N terminus of the core ExoN domain (aa 62 to 297) but no critical residues were found in other parts of the ExoN domain (aa 90 to 297). deletion of one amino acid (A79) at the N terminus of the ExoN domain abolished the N7-MTase activity of nsp14. ten of the 12 critical residues identified are distributed throughout the core domain of N7-MTase. removal of 6 aa from the C terminus already severely attenuated the enzymatic activity of nsp14 N7-MTase. this suggests that the C-terminal part of the N7-MTase domain contains the conserved cleavage site of 3CLpro. modeled structure of the nsp14 MTase domain shows an MTase fold similar to that of other MTases. only residues that are highly conserved in the SAM-binding region of the core fold are the glycine-rich sequence E/DxGxGxG. alanine substitutions of 6 other residues affected the SAM-binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Y368 and C382 are predicted to reside in the B helix and one loop. these residues may not be in direct contact with SAM but may play a structural role in stabilizing the SAM-binding pocket. MHV mutations C376Y and C408R led to a temperature-sensitive phenotype of the mutant viruses (30) these mutants grew well at low temperature (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) but attenuated or abolished the viability of yeast cells at higher temperature (30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C), which may destabilize the structure of the MTase fold."}
