{"summary": "CF is the most common recessive lethal genetic disorder in Caucasian populations. dysfunction of CFTR in CF airway epithelium disrupts normal regulation of ion transport. failure of effective mucus clearance initiates and exacerbates CF lung disease. in non-CF human airways, CFTR is expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells of the surface and submucosal gland ductal epithelium [3], and in fluid-secreting cells of the submucosal glands [4]. ciliated cells are the predominant luminal epithelial cell type present throughout the proximal and distal conducting airways and are critical cell types for facilitating MCT. currently available gene transfer vectors approved for clinical testing are inefficient at delivering CFTR to sufficient numbers of surface epithelial cells. the target number of cells needed to express CFTR for restoration of ASL and MCT is currently unknown. human parainfluenza virus selectively targets ciliated cells of HAE after luminal delivery. CFTR gene delivery to ciliated airway epithelium is sufficient to correct the fundamental physiological dysfunctions that precipitate CF lung pathogenesis. PIVGFP infects ciliated cells of an in vitro model of human airway epithelium that recapitulates the morphology of the human ciliated airway epithelium in vivo. CF ciliated cells were targeted in vitro and ex vivo by PIV. bar represents 20 m in (A); and 5 m in (B, C, and D) a PIV with CFTR inserted into the viral genome was constructed. f glycoprotein was detected by indirect immunofluorescence with a murine monoclonal anti-F Ab and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red) fluorescence was viewed using a Texas Red filter only (A and B) bars represent 200 m and 10 m for (A and B, and C and D), respectively. the vector replicates in ciliated cells and by 24 h pi, sheds progeny virions onto the culture surface, resulting in further rounds of ciliated cell infection. however, when low viral titers were used to inoculate HAE, evidence of further rounds of infection was not apparent until 48 h pi [17] CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR produced a 236-fold increase in CFTR mRNA compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP or mock. CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR expressed large amounts of mature CFTR (Figure 3B, lane 3, band C), while no mature CFTR protein was detected in CF HAE inoculated with vehicle alone (lane 1) or PIVGFP (lane 2). two independent measures of CFTR abundance indicate a significant overexpression of both CFTR mRNA and protein in transduced CF HAE. we estimate an approximately 50-fold increase in mature CFTR protein in transduced CF HAE was achieved compared to non-CF HAE. CFTR was detected with CFTR monoclonal Ab (clone 596) and secondary Abs conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red). CFTR was detected with CFTR monoclonal Ab (clone 596) and secondary Abs conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red). CFTR was detected with CFTR monoclonal Ab (clone 596) and secondary Abs conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red CFTR delivery to ciliated cells resulted in restoration of functional Cl channel activity in CF HAE to levels exhibited in non-CF HAE. each bar represents at least 11 cultures from four different patients. ns denotes not significantly different. CFTR (endogenous or PIV-delivered), GFP, or PIV antigens were never detected in cell types that did not posses cilia. we maximally stimulated cAMP-mediated anion transport capacity using forskolin (Fsk), an activator of CFTR. for comparison, a I sc trace from a non-CF HAE is also shown. overexpression of CFTR in CF ciliated cells does not increase anion transport beyond that of non-CF HAE. CF HAE overexpressing CFTR showed identical anion secretion as measured in non-CF HAE with endogenous CFTR levels. overexpression of CFTR resulted in mislocalization of a fraction of CFTR. CFTR immunoreactivity was restricted to the apical domains of ciliated cells. CFTR immunoreactivity was restricted to the apical domains of ciliated cells. addition of CFTR172 to apical and/or basolateral compartments resulted in rapid and complete inhibition of secretion. Fsk-induced I SC in non-CF HAE inoculated with mock (black bars), PIVGFP (green bars), or PIVCFTR (red bars) compared to non-CF HAE (white bars) (n = 8) al Cl substitution, Fsk again stimulated similar responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR compared to non-CF HAE. these observations strongly suggest that overexpressed levels of CFTR do not produce reduction in Cl secretory driving forces that offset the additional quantity of CFTR in the apical membrane. k treatment in mock-treated non-CF HAE, no significant differences in resistance were measured before/after forskolin treatment after PIVCFTR versus PIVGFP inoculations. the results suggest replacement of a corrective CFTR gene to CF ciliated cells is the only manipulation required for correction of the CF defect. expression of CFTR in CF ciliated cells restores normal ASL homeostasis and MCT to CF HAE. each bar represents eight cultures derived from three different patients. each bar represents nine cultures from three patients. each bar represents at least nine cultures derived from three patients. the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is rate-limiting for Na+ absorption and is negatively regulated by CFTR expression. expression of CFTR, but not GFP, in CF ciliated cells significantly reduced the contribution of CF HAE Na+ transport to levels measured in non-CF HAE. ENaC and CFTR both reside in ciliated cells in the human airway epithelium. delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells restored regulation of ASL height to levels maintained by non-CF HAE. we investigated whether the depletion of ASL over time impaired cilia beat by measuring ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of CF HAE. effective CBF was reduced 48 h later in CF HAE compared to non-CF HAE. a small bolus of 1-m fluorescent beads added to the apical surfaces and cultures maintained at >95% humidity for 24 h. in contrast, PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE showed significant rotational flow of beads, indicating that MCT had been restored. a possible explanation may relate to potentially subtle cytopathic effects of PIV infection at 48 h pi. PIVCFTR-mediated bioelectric correction showed significant functional correction for at least 1 wk with detectable, but decreased levels of function remaining at 21 d pi. previously, we have shown that PIV-infected ciliated cells are shed from the epithelium by a poorly understood process of extruding infected ciliated cells onto the lumenal surfaces of HAE [17]. CF HAE were inoculated with PIVCFTR (red bars) or PIVGFP (green bars) at day 0, and ion transport studies were performed at days specified (n = 8 cultures derived from 3 different patients) no significant CFTR function was detected in CF HAE inoculated with PIVGFP. more ciliated cells remained compared to PIVGFP. we speculate that ciliated cell shedding is related to the rate of virus replication and that identification or generation of PIV vectors with further attenuated replication may provide delivery vectors that prolong functional CFTR correction. measurements were made 24 h after inoculation with different concentrations of PIVCFTR (103\u2013106 PFU) and correlation of percentage of PIV F-positive cells to: (B) increased CFTR mRNA expression levels. ASL height and MCT were measured in CF HAE 24 h after inoculation. PIVCFTR resulted in concurrent increases in ASL height and MCT rates. a plateau occurring at approximately 40% of PIV-positive cells. this discrepancy is likely related to the cytotoxic effects of PIV infection on MCT, but not ASL measurements. this suggests that 48 h, but not 24 h, of infection with this prototypic PIV vector had detrimental effects on MCT. gene delivery vectors capable of targeting at least 25% of the surface airway epithelial cells will be sufficient to restore ASL height regulation. GFP was detected by indirect immunofluorescence with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Ab) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein (green) Ciliated cells were identified using mouse primary Ab against acetylated -tubulin and detected with anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red (red) PIVGFP or PIVCFTR revealed that similar numbers of ciliated cells were infected by each virus. the percentage of ciliated cells per square centimeter of epithelium surface area determined by -tubulin IV immunodetection showed approximately 70% of surface cells were ciliated cells. ated cell infection by PIVCFTR assessed at 24 h was similar with 5-min, 2-h, or 8-h inoculation times (n = 6) responses positive/negative reflect CXCL8 secretion into apical/basolateral compartments. asterisk (*) denotes p0.05; ns, not significantly different. high numbers of cells with only 5-min inoculation time highlight the high efficiency of PIV infection. short exposure times in the airways will be sufficient for efficient targeting of ciliated cells in vivo. CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR expressed large amounts of mature CFTR (Figure 3B, lane 3, band C) no mature CFTR protein was detected in CF HAE inoculated with vehicle alone (lane 1) or PIVGFP (lane 2). t of CFTR protein in lysates of CF HAE 48 h pi with mock. non-CF HAE lysates also included to detect endogenous CFTR levels. CFTR was detected with CFTR monoclonal Ab (clone 596) and secondary Abs conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red) a representative Fsk-induced I sc response by a non-CF HAE is shown for comparison. no responses were seen in CF HAE inoculated with PIVGFP or mock. each bar represents at least 11 cultures from four different patients. CFTR immunoreactivity was detected after PIVGFPCFTR. ciliated cells positive for GFP were negative for CFTR immunoreactivity. CFTR (endogenous or PIV-delivered), GFP, or PIV antigens were never detected in cell types that did not posses cilia. experiments using CF cells derived from four different donors revealed that the kinetics and magnitudes of the Fsk responses in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE were indistinguishable from those observed for non-CF HAE. an additional control using PIV expressing the nonfunctional CFTR mutant confirmed that functional CFTR was required for bioelectric correction of CF HAE. immunofluorescent localization revealed clear targeting of transduced CFTR to apical domains of CF ciliated cells. it is possible that not all correctly trafficked CFTR was inserted into the apical membrane in regions that facilitate function. CFTR is present in subapical membrane structures likely representing recycling endosomes. CFTR activity was inhibited by apical, but not basolateral, addition of CFTR172 for at least 15 min (n = 4) driving force for Cl secretion does not dictate magnitude of the Fsk response determined by measurement of Fsk-mediated I sc in CF HAE 48 h after inoculation by PIVGFP. Fsk responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR and non-CF HAE were similar under conditions of physiological Cl secretory driving forces (KBR) these observations strongly suggest that overexpressed levels of CFTR do not produce reduction in Cl secretory driving forces that offset additional quantity of CFTR in the apical membrane. CFTR insertion into the apical membranes of ciliated cells is tightly regulated with CFTR-rich recycling endosomes. it is likely that CFTR insertion into the apical membranes of ciliated cells is tightly regulated with recycling and replenishment of CFTR governed by CFTR-rich recycling endosomes. measure of basal contribution of Cl transport to Vt by blocking basolateral membrane cellular Cl entry with bumetanide (104 M) showed that 40% of the Vt in non-CF HAE was accounted for by Cl ion transport. however, in CF HAE, there was no detectable bumetanide-sensitive Vt. height measurements 24 h after apical addition of 25 l of PBS to CF HAE 48 h pi with mock (black), PIVGFP (green), or PIVCFTR (red) each bar represents at least nine cultures derived from three patients. CFTR delivery to CF ciliated cells affected the activity of ENaC under thin-film conditions using microelectrodes. the change in Vt, in response to the Na+ channel blocker, benzamil (105 M), indicated that Na+ transport accounted for approximately 40% of the total Vt in non-CF HAE (Figure 5A, white bars) and approximately 80% of transport in CF HAE (black bars) CF epithelia absorbed almost all fluid from their surfaces, resulting in an ASL height of 3 m, i.e., the minimal space of compacted folded-over cilia. delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells fully restored the regulation of ASL height to levels maintained by non-CF HAE. CFTR expression in CF Ciliated Cells Restores Effective MCT. the cilia beat produces rotational flow of mucus over hydrated epithelial apical surfaces. in CF HAE, the rotational flow is abolished due to ASL depletion. a possible explanation may relate to potentially subtle cytopathic effects of PIV infection at 48 h pi. to address this possibility, we inoculated non-CF HAE with PIVGFP. PIVGFP decreased MCT to 403% (n = 5) of normal levels, whereas PIVCFTR decreased MCT to approximately 7411% (n = 5) of normal levels. CFTR functional activity in CF HAE-corrected CF HAE likely reflects shedding of infected ciliated cells. the loss of PIV-positive ciliated cells paralleled the loss of Cl transport. the magnitude of correction was indeed directly proportional to the number of CF ciliated cells expressing CFTR. ciliated cell shedding was delayed for PIVCFTR versus PIVGFP by day 8 pi. the numbers of ciliated cells were similar at day 2 and 4 pi for both transgenes (CFTR or GFP) by day 8 pi, significantly more ciliated cells remained compared to PIVGFP. inoculation of CF HAE with different concentrations of PIVCFTR (range 103\u2013106 PFU) resulted in inoculum-dependent increases in the percentage of PIV-positive cells at 24 h pi. 80% of surface cells were ciliated cells. CFTR and ENaC modulate ENaC activity in non-CF airway epithelium. absence of CFTR reduces fluid secretion and leads to dysregulation of ENaC activity overall. CFTR restores CFTR function, ENaC regulation, and ASL homeostasis. at least 25% of surface epithelial cells required CFTR expression to restore ASL height regulation to non-CF HAE levels. for MCT, approximately 40% of cells (50% of ciliated cells) required CFTR expression to approach MCT rates measured in parallel non-CF HAE. cytotoxic effects of PIV infection on MCT, but not ASL measurements. ciliated cells facilitate effective MCT and airway mucus clearance. ciliated cells facilitate effective MCT and airway mucus clearance. this cell type is a logical target for CF lung gene delivery strategies. a critical variable for restoration of CFTR functional activity by PIV is the percentage of cells expressing CFTR. CFTR expression in approximately 25% of ciliated cells corrects the ENaC hyperabsorption defect. CFTR expression in approximately 30% of ciliated cells corrects ASL volume homeostasis in CF HAE. human airway epithelium models are more representative and relevant to the required efficiency of CFTR delivery to human airway epithelium in vivo. we are not aware of gene delivery vectors capable of delivering CFTR exclusively to nonciliated cells of HAE. we propose targeting at least ciliated cells provides efficient and effective CFTR function that is sufficient for restoration of MCT. if these regions respond similarly to CFTR delivery, then it is possible that delivering CFTR to fewer than 25% of CF cells may provide sufficient MCT to maintain healthy airways. however, testing our PIV vectors in vivo in appropriate models is difficult. the recent generation of a CF pig model may be beneficial for testing such vector systems. CFTR was transgenically overexpressed in mouse airway epithelium without deleterious results in terms of cell or organ toxicity. the study represents the first demonstration of the functional safety of CFTR overexpression in human ciliated cells. the lower replication capacity 10-fold reduction of PIVCFTR compared to PIVGFP suggests that further attenuation of PIV will continue to provide sufficient CFTR for correction of the CF MCT defect. thelium overcomes a major hurdle to gene transfer approaches for CF lung disease. the results so far have not shown significant improvement in the ability to deliver transgenes to human ciliated airway epithelium. similar vectors can be envisioned using the glycoproteins of PIV to target lentiviruses. CFTR cDNA or GFP and CFTR as separate genes was generated from the cDNA antigenome of full-length hPIV3 JS strain. after rescue, PIV replicated in HEp2 cells to a titer comparable to the JS wild-type strain. titers generated by CF HAE were determined in duplicate by procedures previously described. human tracheobronchial tissues with 1 cm2 of epithelial cell surface area were inoculated with 100 l of PIVGFP (107 PFU/ml) or vehicle control for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after fixation in 4% PFA, tissues were paraffin-embedded, and histological sections were prepared. immunodetection of GFP was performed as described below. CF and non-CF HAE inoculated with PIVGFP were scraped with pipette tips and cell suspensions in PBS. CFTR was detected with anti-human CFTR mouse monoclonal Ab #596. goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor594 (Invitrogen) confocal images and DIC were taken with leica SP2 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Western blot analyses of CFTR protein were performed on HAE lysed in M-PER buffer (Pierce) quantitative PCR was performed using a Roche LightCycler. levels of CFTR mRNA were normalized to the level of GAPDH. CFTR172 did not affect forskolin-activated responses even when left 15 min until addition of CFTR172 to the contralateral surface. all CF HAE were inoculated with either PIVGFP or PIVCFTR at day 0, and on specific days, cultures were mounted in Ussing chambers for analyses. images of the Texas Red\u2013labeled ASL are acquired by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss Model 510) using the appropriate filters. perfluorocarbon was added to the airway surface 10 min after the addition of the dye to avoid evaporation of ASL. one-way ANOVA was performed when more than two groups were compared with a single control. differences between individual groups within the set assessed by a multiple-comparison test. tracheobronchial tissues with 1 cm2 of epithelial cell surface area were inoculated with 100 l of PIVGFP (107 PFU/ml) or vehicle control for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after fixation in 4% PFA, tissues were paraffin-embedded, and histological sections were prepared. immunodetection of GFP was performed as described below. rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal Ab (Ab-Cam) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein (Jackson ImmunoResearch) both in vitro and ex vivo, GFP colocalized to cells that were also positive for acetylated -tubulin. confocal images and DIC were taken with a leica SP2 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. the apical surfaces of CF HAE inoculated with PIVGFP or mock were washed in 200 l of PBS for 30 min. slides were then counterstained with Giemsa or probed with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal Ab. RNA from three individual CF HAE per inoculation was pooled. cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) and superScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) levels of CFTR mRNA were normalized to the level of GAPDH. CFTR172 (105 M) was added to the apical or basolateral bath 15 min before or during forskolin-activated CFTR ion transport. the electrometer output was digitized online, and I sc, Rt, and calculated Vt displayed on a video monitor. 100 l of perfluorocarbon (Fluorinert-77; 3 M Corporation) was added to the airway surface 10 min prior to recording. perfluorocarbon was added to the airway surface 10 min prior to recording. images of the Texas Red\u2013labeled ASL are acquired by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. the rate of microsphere displacement was measured from time-lapse fluorescent images acquired for 3 s with an inverted epifluorescence microscope. angular bead transport velocity was calculated as previously described. unpaired Student t-test was used to assess the difference between groups. PIVGFP-CFTR expresses two transgenes, GFP and CFTR, simultaneously. CF HAE secreted inflammatory mediators into apical and basolateral compartments of CF HAE 48 h pi with mock (vehicle control alone), PIVGFP (hatched bars), PIVGFP (green bars), or PIVCFTR (red bars). CF HAE, PIVCFTR only infected ciliated cells. arrowheads show absence of CFTR in nonciliated cells. arrowheads show absence of CFTR in nonciliated cells."}
