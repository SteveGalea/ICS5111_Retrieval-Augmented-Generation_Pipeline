{"summary": "ZIKV is an emerging Flavivirus which was first isolated from Uganda in 1947. it is transmitted through bite of Aedes mosquitoes. spiky spread of ZIKV and its epidemic potential are especially problematic in countries with endogenous ZIKV circulation. the aim of this manuscript was to describe the Zika Virus epidemiology, current phobia, and the required preparedness for its prevention during the upcoming mass gathering events. many articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant articles were utilized. people can catch infection through person to person transmission. ae. mosquitoes usually bite during the day times (after sunrise and before sunset) kb single stranded RNA arbovirus member of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. it is related to dengue fever, Yellow Fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis, and Chikungunya viruses. in 2014, ZIKV was proven to be capable of reproducing itself. it was found in the semen of a man at least two weeks (may be up to 10 weeks) after he became ill. ten countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus. the cause of phobia about Zika is due to its suspected implication with increased neonatal microcephaly. the cause of phobia is due to its suspected implication with increased neonatal microcephaly (as discussed), and other neurological conditions as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. more than 7 million people come every year to the KSA for Hajj and Omra. Until now there is no confirmed ZIKV cases in the KSA. epidemic was described in the Pacific in 2007 and 2013 (Yap and French Polynesia, respectively), and Cook Island and New Caledonia in 2014.7 During May 2015, the WHO notified the first local transmission of ZIKV in the Americas, with circulation in Brazil. since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and other countries in the Pacific. 6,12,13 Zika antibodies were detected also in ducks, goats, cows, horses, bats, and carabaos. ten countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus. microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations associated with ZIKV congenital infection have been reported from 10 countries or territories. it was suggested also that ZIKV can be transmitted through breast feeding. the majority of cases with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic, and among them are some blood donors. MGs have diverse public health challenges and need more international considerations. this occurs in era of widely accessible air travel, and the world globalization. this occurs in era of widely accessible air travel, and the world globalization. dengue fever virus in KSA.5 Standard measures applied every year prevent many diseases that can occur during Hajj and Omra.7,20 Collaborative efforts are also needed this year to prevent transmission of the ZIKV into KSA. development and assessment of models for integrated risk management for local and international mass gatherings is also required. females from infected areas can post-pone pregnancy until more is known about relation of ZIKV to infants\u2019 microcephaly, abortion and miscarriage. anyone who has Zika infection should avoid mosquito bites during the first week of illness to protect others from getting sick through this mosquito. there is no specific treatment, sero- prophylaxis, or chemo-prophylaxis for ZIKV. most of these are in preclinical trial development and many are expected to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2017.35 Intensifying compulsory vaccination against yellow fever This is needed for travelers to areas infested with Aedes Aegypti mosquito."}
