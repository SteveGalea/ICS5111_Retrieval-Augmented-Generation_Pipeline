{"summary": "study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. a third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. interleukin-18 (IL-18) is related to the IL-1 family in terms of structure and function. IL-18 induces low levels of IFN-, but in the presence of co-stimulants, IFN- production is greatly enhanced. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the interleukin-18 gene is associated with the presence of psoriasis, but not atopic dermatitis. this suggests that the SNP is associated with susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris, but not by affecting the production of IL-18. those included in the study were adult psoriatic patients 18 years old who should not have received a topical therapeutic modality apart from petrolatum for the last four weeks. three patients were hypertensive, three had psoriatic arthropathy, one had hepatitis C virus with anaemia of chronic disorder type and one had diabetes mellitus with hypertension. patients receiving systemic methotrexate were subjected to monitoring liver tests monthly. eight patients with mild to moderate degrees of psoriasis were maintained on topical steroid creams and ointments in the form of betamethasone dipropionate, twice daily. a third psoriatic lesional skin biopsy was taken from all patients. amplification of gene for glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydro\u00adgenase (GAPDH), a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene, was performed on all samples. mRNA levels were expressed in picograms/microlitre (pg/l) RNA extraction and complementary (c) DNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted using QIA amp RNA extraction kit provided from QIAGEN worldwide companies. cDNAs were stored at \u201320\u00b0C until real-time quantitative PCR was performed. protocol was 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, then 40 cycles for 15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. all genes were subsequently normalized against GAPDH levels. range of PASI score in different types of psoriasis Type of psoriasis PASI score grades Mild* Moderate* Severe* Total (%) Plaque-type 3 2 1 6 (37.5) Erythrodermic 1 1 (6.3) Guttate 1 1 (6.3) Flexural 1 1 (6.3) Palmoplantar 2 2 (12.5) Plaque and gutt 2 2 (12.5) Plaque and p.p 1 1 (6.3) Plaque and patients on MTX IL-18 NL 8 0.592.1 0.17\u20136.4 0.2275 0.53 2.53 IL-18 LA 8 0.61.58 0.012\u20131.6 0.1275 0.415 1.2 Patients on MTX IL-18 NL 8 1.932.84 0.012\u20137.9 0.1625 0.685d 3.775 IL-18 LB 8 4.897.56 0.49\u201322.7 0.602 1.385 6.2 IL-18 LA 8 2.953.52 the IL-18 expression in the psoriatic skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023) the highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. the highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. signi\u00adficantly lower IL-18 expression was detected in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.018) the change of expression levels in non-lesional skin after treatment was not statistically significant when compared to non-lesional skin (P = 0.069) and lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.12) all studied patients IL-18 NL 16 1.102.14 0.01\u20137.90 0.0300 0.1850a 1.2675 IL-18 LB 16 3.245.63 0.17\u201322.70 0.4900 0.9050 4.9000 IL-18 LA 16 1.782.72 0.01\u20138.10 0.2750 0.4600b 1.5250 Patients on TS IL-18 NL 8 0.260.44 0.01\u20131.3 0.014 0.051c 0.337 IL-18 LB 8 significantly lower IL-18 expression in uninvolved skin than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.001) and lesional skin after treatment (P = 0.002) was demonstrated in all studied patients as one group. highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. skin before treatment (P = 0.012) and after treatment (P = 0.012) no statistical significance could be obtained when comparing the change of expression before and after topical treatment (P = 0.069) in patients receiving methotrexate, signi\u00adficantly lower IL-18 expression was detected in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.12) keratinocytes are capable of synthesizing low levels of IL-18 mRNA even under non-stimulated conditions. this is consistent with previous studies showing that human keratinocytes are capable of synthesizing low levels of IL-18 mRNA. levels in lesional psoriatic skin were reduced after 14 days. but the reduction became statistically significant only after 28 days. this is supported by studies demonstrating a decrease of IL-18 levels after narrowband UVB therapy. gene expression profiles in psoriasis did not reveal any correlation. however, IL-10 expression was correlated significantly with disease duration. cytokine appears crucial in the development of the active psoriatic lesion itself."}
