{"summary": "myocarditis is defined as a subclinical inflammation of the heart muscle. enteroviruses represent one of the most common groups of viruses detected in the myocardium [2] 1% of the population were found to have lymphocytic myocarditis. the CVB group includes serotypes, in particular CVB3, that are frequently associated with infections of the heart. a persistant CVB3 infection and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can be developed. the pathogenic mechanisms of CVB3 induced myocarditis are yet not fully understood. wessely et al. generated transgenic mice that expressed a replication restricted CVB3 cDNA exclusively in the heart. these animals expressed the coxsackieviral genomes in their cardiomyocytes at low-level without forming infectious virus particles. this study confirmed that non-replicative coxsackieviruses are sufficient to induce DCM. the protease 2A cleaves the eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) eIF4GI and eIF4GII, leading to cessation of host protein synthesis. impaired dystrophin functions lead to the disruption of the extra-sarcomeric cytoskeleton and loss of transmission of mechanical force to the extracellular matrix [29,30] the first essential step of viral infection is the interaction of the viral capsid with the receptor on the surface of the host cell. coxsackievirus capsids are assembled from 60 identical protomers, each composed of the four structural proteins VP1\u2013VP4. WIN compounds are antiviral drugs interacting with the hydrophobic pocket at the bottom of the canyon [42] WIN 54954 is one of the first WIN compounds to be clinically tested. it can reduce picornavirus titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. in vivo administration in mice experimentally infected with CVB3 led to a reduction of the proportion of cardiomyocytes containing viral RNA by about 90%. WIN 63843 (pleconaril) represents a novel, orally available, systemically-acting compound of the WIN series with a high oral bio-availability and long plasma half-life. the compound has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against clinical isolates and prototypic strains of enteroviruses. Pleconaril has not yet been used explicitly for the treatment of enterovirus induced myocarditis. but in vivo studies showed an efficient antiviral efficacy of the compound in enterovirus induced mouse myocarditis. mice showed reduced mortality and a reduction of the CVB3 titer in the heart by about 4 to 7 orders of magnitude [60] a single mutation in the viral 2C protein is sufficient to confer resistance against the antiviral treatment. their antiviral activity against coxsackieviruses was only investigated in in vitro experiments. a single mutation in the viral 2C protein is sufficient to confer resistance against the antiviral treatment. ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside, structurally related to inosine and guanosine. when ribavirin is incorporated into viral RNA it induces mutations that can be lethal for the virus. ribavirin has a broad antiviral activity against several RNA viruses in vivo. the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major intracellular pathway for protein degradation. over 80% of cellular proteins are recycled through this pathway. several inhibitory substances targeting the UPS were analyzed for their ability to inhibit coxsackievirus infections. coxsackievirus capsids are assembled from 60 identical protomers, each composed of the four structural proteins VP1\u2013VP4. the viral shell is formed by VP1 to VP3, and VP4 lies on the inner surface and establishes a connection between the capsid and the RNA genome.

WIN 54954 is one of the first WIN compounds to be clinically tested. it reduces picornavirus titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. in vivo administration in mice experimentally infected with CVB3 led to a reduction of the proportion of cardiomyocytes containing viral RNA by about 90%. WIN 63843 (pleconaril) represents a novel, orally available, systemically-acting compound of the WIN series with a high oral bio-availability and long plasma half-life. it has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against clinical isolates and prototypic strains of enteroviruses. mice showed reduced mortality and a reduction of the CVB3 titer in the heart by about 4 to 7 orders of magnitude. a series of compounds, such as guanidine hypochloride, HBB, MRL-1237 and TBZE-029, interact with the viral protein 2C. they interact with non-structural proteins, viral proteases or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibit viral replication in infected cells. coxsackieviruses was only investigated in in vitro experiments. a single mutation in the viral 2C protein is sufficient to confer resistance against the antiviral treatment. the NO donors are able to inhibit enterovirus proteases 2A and 3C by S-nitrosylation. ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside, structurally related to inosine and guanosine. it induces mutations that can be lethal for the virus. ribavirin has a broad antiviral activity against several RNA viruses in vivo. in the last few years several inhibitory substances targeting the UPS were analyzed for their ability to inhibit coxsackievirus infections. peptide-aldehyde MG132 and lactacystin reduced coxsackieviral RNA synthesis, protein expression and progeny release up to 170-fold and 20-fold respectively, in vitro. the role of IFNs in CVB3 infections became obvious when IFN knockout mice proved to be highly susceptible to CVB3 infections. in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of IFN treatment for coxsackievirus infections of the heart. antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded molecules composed of DNA monomers and modified variants thereof. they bind to a complementary (virus) RNA and prevent its translation or induce its degradation by RNase H. the only antisense oligonucleotide that has been approved by the regulatory authorities to date is fomivirsen, a phosphorothioate-modified DNA oligonucleotide. morpholino oligomers do not induce RNase H cleavage of the target RNA. their mechanism of action is based on a steric blockade of the target RNA function. short double-stranded RNA molecules were found to efficiently inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells. RNAi-mediated therapies against HIV-1 and HBV are based on shRNA expression systems [113], the most advanced clinical phase II trial makes use of chemically synthesized siRNAs against RSV. RNAi has been evaluated as novel strategy to inhibit CVB3 because of the highly efficient nature of RNAi. a major problem for the long term inhibition of viruses is the emergence of escape mutants. this limitation is well known for conventional antiviral therapy with low-molecular weight drugs. three counter-strategies have been followed to counter the problem of viral escape. the cis-acting replication element (CRE) is located in the 2C protein coding region. an siRNA directed against this region conferred sustained protection against CVB3 and prevented the emergence of viable escape mutants. a widely employed strategy to minimize viral escape in conventional virus therapy is to combine various agents with antiviral activity. inant Dicer was found to be significantly more effective than single-site siRNAs. it is currently unclear whether the pool of siRNAs will induce more severe off-target effects than single-site siRNAs. the third strategy for sustained inhibition of viral spread is silencing genes of the host cells that are required by the virus to enter cells and replicate. knock-out mice showed a complete atrio-ventricular block and various phenotypes in other organs as well. no direct conclusions can be drawn from knockout experiments for RNAi applications. knock-out animals completely lack CAR while RNAi only results in a partial knockdown of target gene expression, possibly leaving enough to prevent these defects from occurring. an artificial micro RNA (amiRNA) targeting the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the CVB3 genome was used as the silencing mediator. the amiRNA was designed to contain mismatches to the central region of the target site. the amiRNA was shown to tolerate mutations, thus having the potential to suppress viral escape mutants. lentiviral vector delivered shRNA expression cassette against highly conserved CRE region. mice were injected intraperitoneally with the lentiviral vector. mice with CVB3 myocarditis, RNAi treatment significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction. RNAi has been evaluated as novel strategy to inhibit CVB3. all of the initial studies showed that only siRNAs against the coding region of the virus genome revealed significant antiviral activity, but not those against the untranslated regions. silencing of the viral plus-strand is key to inhibit CVB3. several groups have initially directed siRNA against the 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019UTR) of the CVB3 genome. a possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that tight structures such as the IRES are detrimental to siRNA-mediated gene silencing. a systematic investigation of viral escape in cell culture revealed that cocktails of three siRNAs targeting distinct sites of the virus genome could maintain therapeutic efficacy. virus inhibition with dual- or single-molecule-based RNAi was abrogated by viral escape. recently the idea was advanced to use a pool of siRNAs covering 3.5 kb of CVB3 genomic sequence. CAR is located in the tight junctions of epithelial cells [132,134] and its constitutive knockout was found to result in an embryonic lethal condition associated with cardiac defects. animals with a conditional knockout of CAR at a later time point of embryonic development (E11) survived to adulthood and did not have evident cardiac abnormalities. a block of atrio-ventricular conduction developed in the absence of CAR in the adult mouse heart. siRNAs containing LNA, as well as unlocked nucleic acids (UNA) have been tested against CVB3 [142] further studies have shown that the introduction of UNAs into an siRNA minimizes off-target activity. a second major hurdle for the application of RNAi is efficient cellular delivery of the siRNAs. plasmid-derived shRNAs were used to inhibit CVB3 in balb/c mice. the siRNAs and shRNA expression plasmids were applied by hydrodynamic transfection. this method involves high pressure injection of the nucleic acid into the tail vein. viral vectors can be directed by the use of pseudotyped, self-complementary AAV vectors. they consist of a genome based on the standard serotype 2 and capsid proteins from a different serotype. delivery of the shRNA double expression cassette by a pseudotyped, self-complementary AAV vector into primary rat cardiomyocytes inhibited CVB3 replication. the antibody Fc-region promotes the solubilization of the SRA. the half-life of the fusion protein increases up to 100-fold in vivo. recognition of the IgG-Fc domain by Fc receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages enables clearing of the virus shortly after the virus is bound to the soluble receptor peptide. sCAR-Fc induces the formation of altered (A)-particles lacking VP4 and the viral RNA. sCAR-Fc induces the formation of altered (A)-particles. the protective effect of SRA has been described for several viruses. sCAR-Fc binds to CVB3 with 5,000- to 10,000-higher affinities. sCAR-Fc induces A-particles, whereas sDAF-Fc forms reversible complexes with CVB3 [158]. sCAR-Fc inhibits CVB3-induced pancreatitis in vivo. sCAR-Fc expression was induced by addition of Dox 2 days before, concomitant and 1 day after CVB3 infection. a significant improvement of systolic and diastolic cardiac parameters was detected in animals in which sCAR-Fc expression was induced prior to or concomitant with the virus. the mechanisms leading to these auto-immunologic side effects are not yet understood. there may be specific immunological reactions related to the specific sequence of CAR4/7, or perhaps it relates to the fact that recombinant CAR4/7 was produced in bacteria. this altered its glycosylation pattern and increased the risk of co-purifying pro-inflammatory substances. cell therapy aims at the restoration of the physiological cellular composition of diseased organs. transplantation of exogenous cells is therefore considered to be the likely next generation of cardiac cell therapies. a wide panel of pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances with strong antiviral activity have been developed but none are in routine clinical use. more recently biologics such as SRA, siRNAs or MSC have been found to be suitable to inhibit viral replication and inhibit coxsackievirus myocarditis. receptor analogues soluble receptor analogues sDAF-Fc sDAF-Fc sCAR-sDAF-Fc cell therapy cell therapy MSC Based on our understanding of the pathogenesis of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. antiviral therapy and its combination with immunomodulatory therapies may hold the greatest potential for improving the therapeutic outcome of coxsackievirus infection."}
