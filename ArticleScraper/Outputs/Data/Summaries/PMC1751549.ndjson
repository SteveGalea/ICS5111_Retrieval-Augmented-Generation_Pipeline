{"summary": "Querying MMDB with text terms may identify structures of interest based on a protein name. links between databases provide other search mechanisms. MMDB and its visualization services handle 25 000 user queries per day. MMDB currently contains 39 000 structure entries, corresponding to 90 000 chains and 170 000 3D domains. links to the Conserved Domain Database are identified by BLAST (5). Sequences derived from MMDB are entered into Entrez's protein or nucleic acid sequence database. links to the organism taxonomy database are generated by matching citations. links to the organism taxonomy database are generated by matching citations. 48% of non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been linked to at least one related structure, employing a conservative threshold for alignment length (50 aligned residues or more) the analysis also excludes protein sequences directly obtained from MMDB. \u2018Related structures\u2019 generates a request to the Related Structure service (http://structure.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cblast/cblast.cgi\"client=entrez&query_gi=6978757) the resulting page indicates with a horizontal bar, the sequence region annotated by each related structure (Figure 2). a Cn3D view of the query sequence from Figure 2 aligned to chain A of the related structure 1O86 (PDB code). residues within a 5 A contact radius of the bound drug lisinopril are highlighted in the 3D structure view. 'Related Structure' may be expanded further in the future to provide visualization for other NCBI resources and to support additional filtering and selection among related structures. the \u2018Related Structure\u2019 service is built on top of this system. non-identical protein sequences in Entrez protein have been classified into groups linked to related structures, at various levels of sequence similarity. the analysis also excludes protein sequences directly obtained from MMDB. a 'Table' option switches to a text view, listing descriptions of each structure as well as alignment scores. clicking on the \u2018Related Structure\u2019 option from the \u2018Links\u2019 pull-down menu launches the summary view. residues that contact the catalytic Zinc ion can be mapped from the structure to aligned regions in the sequence window using Cn3D's highlighting functionality. one may also examine sequence alignments with related structures 1UZE and 1UZF, human ACE binding to enalaprilat and captopril, respectively, drugs with chemical structures similar to that of lisinopril."}
