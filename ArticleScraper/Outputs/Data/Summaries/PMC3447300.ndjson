{"summary": "most avian influenza viruses do not infect humans, but the 1997 outbreak of the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong alerted the medical community that some subtypes of avian influenza viruses include highly pathogenic strains that can affect humans. in this influenza virus outbreak, there were 6 deaths in the 18 human cases caused by the H5N1 subtype. the avian influenza outbreaks occurred in Japan since 2003 reported by prefecture. the avian influenza outbreaks occurred in Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures in 2005 and 2006. the H3 subtype was reported in Saitama Prefecture in 2009. the H7 subtype was in Aichi Prefecture in 2009. site 1 is located at 600 m east from the poultry farm A. sites 4\u20136 are located within 700\u2013900 m west from the poultry farm A. virus surveillance was carried out for migrating birds around the outbreak areas in Kyoto. the origin of the H5N1 strain was traced back to a virus isolated from wild ducks in Guangdong Province, China, in 1996. this virus strain caused further H5N1 outbreaks in Shandong Province, China, in 2003, in Korea in December 2003, and the 2003-2004 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in Japan. tomological survey was conducted in 2004 to investigate the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 virus. a total of 926 flies were collected within a 2.3 km radius of poultry farm A in Tamba Town. 80% of the collected flies identified as either Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven or Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) the viral M, HA, and NA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers. full-length sequences were analyzed, and sizes were found to be 991, 1,707, and 1,362 bp respectively. the virus from C. nigribarbis (A/blow fly/Kyoto/93/2004) was characterized as an H5N1 subtype influenza A virus based on neuraminidase gene sequences. incubation at 10\u00b0C was chosen because the average temperature around Tamba Town was 3.6\u00b0C in February and 6.4\u00b0C in March. average daytime highs of 11.1\u00b0C in February and 13.1\u00b0C in March were used for virus isolation and titration. at 14 d after exposure, no virus was isolated from any blow fly at 20\u00b0C or 10\u00b0C. + 3 h 5 + 2.60 + + 3.00 + NT 5.00 + 6 + 1.67 + + 1.67 + 7 + 0.50 + + 0.50 + 8 + 4.63 + + 3.50 + 9 + 3.63 + 10 + 0.50 + + 0.50 + 1 + 0.50 + NT + NT 4.50 + 3 0.50 + 0.50 + NT + 1 + 1.00 + 1.00 + NT + 1 h 2 + 0.50 + 0.50 + NT + 1 h 2 + 0.
