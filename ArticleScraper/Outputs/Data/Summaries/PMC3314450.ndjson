{"summary": "in peripheral organs, innate DCs detect the presence and nature of pathogens (viral, bacterial, or protozoal; intracellular or extracellular) and educate T cells about the specifics of pathogen threat. innate immune cells prime and instruct T lymphocytes in a perfect immunological world. cytokines and chemokines expressed by resident CNS cells also promote the recruitment of circulating lymphocytes and myeloid cells from the periphery. innate responses in the CNS cannot directly initiate adaptive immunity. there is no evidence that DCs with such capacities reside in the healthy CNS parenchyma. xenografts, viruses, or bacterial lysates fail to elicit adaptive immune responses following non-traumatic micro-injection into the CNS parenchyma. robust intrathecal inflammatory reactions can damage delicate, non-regenerating post-mitotic cells such as neurons and oligodendrocytes. innate immune cells recruit inflammatory cells from the circulation. resident cells interact with these cells to facilitate vigorous inflammatory responses. basic host defense mechanisms are operational in microglia and astrocytes. the largest NLR subfamily (with 14 members) is designated the NACHT domain\u2013, LRR domain\u2013, and pyrin domain\u2013containing protein (NALP) family (25). inflammasomes, defined by their core NALPs, are activated by cytoplasmic presence of specific microbial components, tissue-injury products, or inflammation-associated metabolic alterations including low cytosolic potassium. inflammasomes recruit and activate caspase-1, thereby complementing TLR signaling to generate mature IL-1 and IL-18. another family member, IL-33, is sequestered within cell nuclei, released by cell injury, and inactivated by caspase-1 cleavage (27\u201329) TNF- and IL-6, while IL-18 stimulates production of IL-17. inflammatory cytokines also diminish BBB barrier function. damaged cells release \"danger\" signals, designated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) microglia are related to resident tissue macrophages. it is plausible that microglia also transcribe context-dependent, activation-related genes that confer unique phenotypes. it is plausible that microglia also transcribe context-dependent, activation-related genes that confer unique phenotypes. systemic challenges elicit cytokine responses, which activate microglia. chronic neurodegeneration also leads to microglial activation. the outcome of the activation may be beneficial, deleterious or neutral. microglia directly activates microglia through the NALP3 inflammasome pathway (36), and subsequent production of IL-1 may worsen neurodegeneration (69). glia further subdivided into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and polydendrocytes. microglial-astrocyte interactions are critical in CNS innate immunity. the deciphering of microglial-astrocyte communication at the molecular level is still in its infancy but already shows promise for identifying interesting therapeutic targets. microglia transcribe context-dependent, activation-related genes that confer unique phenotypes. it is plausible that microglia also transcribe context-dependent, activation-related genes that confer unique phenotypes. however, the M1/M2 paradigm has not been extended to any tissue-resident macrophages. genetic models have unraveled certain microglial contributions to neurodegeneration. targeted deletion of the causative mutant superoxide dismutase gene in microglia prolonged the lifespan of the mice even though the mutant transgene was still expressed by neurons and astrocytes. glia is subdivided into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and polydendrocytes. astrocytes are the best-characterized innate immune neuroglia. astrocytes also produce neurotrophins and anti-inflammatory cytokines. inflammatory transcriptional regulator NF-B was silenced in astrocytes by transgenic overexpression of a naturally occurring NF-B inhibitor. the blocking of NF-B signaling in astrocytes showed benefit in disease and injury models. astrocyte-specific inflammatory signaling for a multitude of CNS pathologies. cells are found in peripheral blood of healthy individuals and in MS patients. clonally expanded and potentially autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been detected at autopsy in CNS tissues from individuals with MS but not in relevant controls. GM-CSF is required to recruit CD11b+ myeloid cells. cellular and intracellular bacteria are illustrated by life-threatening conditions that result from neutrophil deficiency (118, 119) neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the bone marrow in response to signals from CXC family chemokines to mediate pleiotropic functions in immune-inflammatory responses. cytokines such as TNF- and IFN- are also activated. lesions of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), an autoimmune CNS disease caused by aquaporin 4 antibodies, show abundant neutrophils. NMO lesions are much more destructive and more likely to cause death during acute disease. fatal outcomes of MS occur through complications of immobility. mast cells are present in active MS plaques (141, 142), and tryptase and histamine are detected in lesions of chronic MS. tryptase and histamine are present in the CSF of MS patients but not healthy individuals. c-kit\u2013mutant, mast cell\u2013deficient mice (147) are mast cell dependent. mast cells were critical for fulminant disease in both chronic (C57BL/6-MOG35\u201355\u2013induced) and relapsing remitting (SJL-PLP139\u2013151\u2013induced) EAE. TNF- production by dura mater and pia mater mast cells regulates BBB function and T cell and myeloid cell infiltration into the CNS. neuroinflammation is inherent in all diseases, which disrupt CNS tissue elements. neuroinflammation is inherent in all diseases, including MS, AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury."}
