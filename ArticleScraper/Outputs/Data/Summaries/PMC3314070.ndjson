{"summary": "NIMS was being developed in an attempt to standardize the management of domestic incidents by creating a single, comprehensive IMS. the 2003 SARS response used the \u201cteam\u201d concept to organize agency-wide response operations. the term \u201cteam\u201d refers to a group of people with complementary skill sets assembled to address a specific public health issue. if adopted, CDC might better prepare CDC to respond to large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. if adopted, CDC needed to develop a better system for integrating traditional public health response functions with newly created infrastructure and programs. the CDC EOC uses an IMS organized by ICS section (i.e., Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance/Administration) instead of discipline or emergency support function. the ICS model allows CDC personnel deployed to the field to be familiar with ICS concepts and principles. however, there are some challenges with organizing a public health response according to the principles of emergency management. CDC implemented a revised all-hazard IMS structure in 2005. it was based on lessons learned from the response to the 2005 hurricane season. this version of the CDC IMS still comprised four sections. the CDC IMS remained as the agency's model for the response to public health emergencies until the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. the traditional public health functions associated with an infectious disease response were located in the TSU and included most subject-matter expertise during the response. the modified CDC IMS structure was implemented in the fall of 2009. the CDC IMS remained as the organizational structure for the response from fall 2009 until 2009 H1N1 response operations ended in May 2010. CDC has further adapted its all-hazards IMS structure by creating a Science Section that is responsible for conducting and coordinating the public health activities associated with a response. the creation of a separate section devoted to scientific/technical issues is in compliance with current NIMS guidance. the activities traditionally conducted by public health are more easily integrated into the concept of emergency management and align with the traditional sections of ICS. the creation of a Science Section takes advantage of the ICS principles and elevates the traditional public health response team concept to a more prominent role in CDC's IMS. public health needs to better integrate traditional public health practice and functions with the principles of emergency management. recent changes to NIMS allow public health to use NIMS/ICS to benefit response."}
