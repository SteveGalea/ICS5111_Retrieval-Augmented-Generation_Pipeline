{"summary": "human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infection in both young children and adults (1, 6, 7, 13) four complete genome sequences of HCoV-NL63 were available in GenBank, all from the Netherlands (8, 12) two long open reading frames (ORFs) are of 12,138 nucleotides (nucleotides 287 to 12,424) and 8,037 nucleotides (nucleotides 12,424 to 20,460) in length. at position 12,424, a potential pseudoknot structure is present which may provide the 1 frameshift signal to translate the 1b polyprotein (9, 10) complete genome sequence of HCoV-NL63 strain CBJ 037 was deposited in GenBank under accession no. JX104161. Nucleotide sequence accession number."}
