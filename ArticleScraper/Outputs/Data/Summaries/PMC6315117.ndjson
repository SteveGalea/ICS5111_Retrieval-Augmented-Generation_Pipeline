{"summary": "equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a positive sense, single-stranded, non-segmented RNA virus. VEEV, along with the closely related eastern (EEEV) and western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV) are part of the family togaviridae. there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for use in humans. influenza A, a negative sense, segmented RNA virus, arrests cells in G0/G1. infected cells showed decreased retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation. the positive sense RNA coronavirus downregulates cell cycle modulators such as cyclins D1 and D2 trapping infected cells in the G phase. a positive sense RNA virus downregulates cell cycle pathways on the transcriptional level, leading to cell cycle arrest at the S phase. infection with VEEV delays the cell cycle and disrupts regulation on a transcriptional level. in synchronized Vero cells, replicating virus induces a delay in the G0/G1 phase. cell cycle-related genes are downregulated in VEEV TC83-infected cell. but the phenotype is reversed with VEEV TC83-Cm. cells were seeded in complete media overnight, washed once with sterile PBS, then serum-free DMEM was added. crystal violet plaque assays determined viral titer as previously described. UV inactivation of VEEV TC83 was performed as previously described. Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry was performed as described previously. vero cells were synchronized via serum-starvation for 72 h. cells were then infected with TC83 (MOI 1), UV-inactivated TC83, or mock-infected for 1 h then released in complete media containing serum. RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR Infected cells were lysed and collected in Qiagen's RLT Buffer. RNA from VEEV-TrD cells were converted to cDNA. qPCR for host genes was performed using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit. anti-cyclin E2 (Cell Signaling Cat#4132), anti-cyclin A2 (Cell Signaling Cat#4656), anti-VEEV capsid (BEI Resources, NR 9403), and HRP-conjugated actin (catalog number ab49900-100, Abcam) antibodies were added to supplemented DMEM at a multiplicity (MOI) of 10 (VEEV-TC83) or 5 (VEEV-TrD), violet plaque assays determined viral titer as previously described. UV inactivation of VEEV TC83 was performed as described previously. Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry was performed as described previously. significance is calculated between mock and infected samples. cell cycle delay is partially dependent on replicating virus and capsid competent for nuclear import. RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR Infected cells were lysed and collected in Qiagen's RLT Buffer. RNA from VEEV-TrD cells were converted to cDNA using the high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. Blots were probed with anti-cyclin D1 (Cell signaling Cat#2978) anti-cyclin E2 (Cell Signaling Cat#4132), anti-cyclin A2 (Cell Signaling Cat#4656), anti-VEEV capsid (BEI Resources, NR 9403), and HRP-conjugated actin (catalog number ab49900-100, Abcam) antibodies. VEEV infected cells (both MOI 1 and 10) displayed similar cell cycle profiles. by 24 hpi, cells infected at MOI 1 had also re-entered the cell. but a delay in G1 is still seen in cells infected at MOI 10. Mutating the NLS alters capsid localization, retaining it primarily in the cytoplasm. capsid's ability to interfere with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and/or transcription contributes to the observed cell cycle delay. VEEV infection resulted in an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase. the majority of the cell population was infected at 16 and 24 hpi. by 24 hpi both TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells displayed fewer viable cells. TC83 induces cell cycle delay in VEEV infected cells. TC83 induces cell cycle delay in VEEV cells. VEEV infected cells treated with a compound, G281-1485, showed a cell cycle profile similar to mock infected cells. this suggests that disruption of capsid-importin interaction relieves the cell cycle delay. capsid is at least partially responsible for the delay at G1and dysregulation of nuclear import is certainly a contributing factor to VEEV-induced cell cycle abnormalities. cyclins and CDKs of the later stages of cell cycle\u2014S, G2, and M\u2014were downregulated at the mRNA level compared to mock infected controls. cyclins and CDKs of the later stages of cell cycle\u2014S, G2, and M\u2014were downregulated at the mRNA level compared to mock infected controls. RNA from VEEV-TrD infected (MOI 5) U87MG cells was collected at 16 hpi, sequenced, and compared to mock-infected controls. pathways selected for cell cycle regulation and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) the larger the value, the more significant), ratio (how many genes in the changed in the pathway over the total number of genes in the pathway, or percentage of pathway coverage), z-score (predicted directionality; NaN = not a number, unable to predict directionality) and the number and percentage of genes in each category (upregulated, downregulated, no change, or no overlap with dataset). genes were either upregulated (top) or downregulated (down) gene regulation was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as with the RNA sequencing data, U87MG cells were mock-infected or infected with VEEV-TrD (MOI 5) then RNA extracted at 16 hpi. the previous flow cytometry data indicated that cells infected with TC83_Cm returned to the cell cycle quicker than cells infected with TC83. capsid is known to downregulate host transcription and TC83_Cm loses this ability. titers were determined by plaque assay. TC83_Cm is not replication deficient compared to TC83 in mice. differences in host transcriptional expression are owing to the mutated NLS. cyclin D1, E2, and A2 protein expression and Rb phosphorylation are reduced following VEEV infection. U87MG cells were synchronized via serum-starvation for 72 h. cells were then infected with VEEV TC83 or mock-infected for 1 h. cells were collected immediately prior to infection as synchronized controls (Mock, 0 h) 78% of cells in G0/G1, 9% in S phase and 13% in G2/M phase. by 16 hpi, mock-infected cells re-entered the cell cycle. a delay in G1 is still seen in cells infected at MOI 10. synchronized cells infected with VEEV are slow to return to the cell cycle. the VEEV capsid has both an NLS and NES and forms a tetrameric complex with the host karyopherins CRM1 and importin /1. this complex halts host nuclear import and downregulates transcription. at 16 hpi, mock infected cells had started to return to cycling. TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells were still delayed in G1. by 24 hpi, S and G2/M populations in TC83_Cm infected cells increased. effect of VEEV on cell cycle progression was also assessed in astrocytes. by 16 hpi both TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells showed fewer viable cells with acorresponding increase in necrotic cells. however, the modest differences observed are not enough to explain cell cycle distribution. cells were collected 24 h post-infection and analyzed by flow cytometry. VEEV infected cells treated with TC83 or mock infected showed a cell cycle profile similar to mock infected cells. a compound, G281-1485, was identified as an inhibitor of capsid-importin interaction. RNA sequencing data generated from astrocytes infected with fully virulent VEEV-TrD (MOI 5, 16 hpi) ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to determine canonical pathways associated with cell cycle, checkpoint regulation, and proliferation that were significantly altered following VEEV infection (z-score of 2.132) markers of chromatin condensation and cessation of transcription, were upregulated, as was the G1 kinase CDK6 (Table 2). These data are in agreement with our cell cycle analysis. infected cells are not progressing through the cell cycle with a block at G1. RNA from VEEV-TrD infected (MOI 5) U87MG cells was collected at 16 hpi. from left to right is the p-value of the right-tailed Fisher's exact test. from left to right is the p-value of the right-tailed Fisher's exact test.

VEEV infection may induce a G0/G1 delay, or \u201cstutter\u201d that is not as profound in TC83_Cm-infected cells. astrogliosis is an increase in astrocyte numbers. between 1 and 50% of reactive astrocytes in various brain injuries are proliferating. astrogliosis can be viewed as beneficial limiting tissue damage and restoring CNS homeostasis. astrogliosis would be inhibited in VEEV infected cells. a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking has been implicated in VEEV capsid induced cell death. additional pathways altered prior to death have yet to be described. cyclin E2 regulate the restriction point (G1/S checkpoint), which is the point in which the cell is committed to undergoing DNA replication. decreased expression of all three of these cyclins severely limits the ability of VEEV infected cells to advance through the cell cycle. ks were only assessed at the mRNA level.
