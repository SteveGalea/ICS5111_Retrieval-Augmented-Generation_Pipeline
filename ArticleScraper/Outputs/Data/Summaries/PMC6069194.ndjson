{"summary": "highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been very successful in treating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. it can suppress the virus to below the limit of detection, thus leading to profound reduction in morbidity and mortality from AIDS. however, HAART doses not eradicate the virus; rather, lifelong treatment is required. there is a pressing need to develop new drugs that target different steps of the viral life cycle. T-20 is a 36-mer peptide derived from the CHR of gp41. it binds to the NHR to prevent the formation of the viral 6-HB structure. it inherits a low genetic barrier to inducing drug resistance (11, 12) in short-term monotherapy, LP-19 could reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in both acutely and chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infected monkeys (20) LP-50 and LP-51 could sharply reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in both acutely and chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus (sIV) infected monkeys. LP-50 was modified by introducing amino acids from the sequences of HIV-2 and SIV into its NHR-binding positions (sites a, d, and e) resulting in LP-51, with a peptide sequence in which >60% of amino acids were mutated. first, we analyzed their interactions with an NHR-derived target mimic peptide (N39) the italic \u201cabcdefg\u201d corresponds to the positions of the amino acids per heptad repeat sequence. the positions and sequences corresponding to the M-T hook structure, pocket-binding domain, and TRM in the CHR are shown in green, red, and purple. LP-50 and LP-51 inhibited divergent HIV-1 subtypes with mean IC50s of 22 and 26 pM. both new inhibitors, like LP-40, had a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of >140 M, suggesting an extremely high therapeutic selectivity index (CC50/IC50 ratio) the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. 2 29 5 B04 B\u2032 5,355 568 1,272 117 23 6 44 3 43-22 B\u2032 30,648 2,054 1,354 662 5 1 8 2 Du156 C 14,433 2,125 10,538 724 6 0 8 1 ZM53 M.PB12 C 25,809 8,710 4,221 715 21 2 19 3 CAP210.2.00.E8 C 140,667 16,565 29,190 2,347 35 2 62 7. LP-50 and LP-51 are highly potent inhibitors of T-20-resistant HIV-1 mutants as well as HIV-2 and SIV isolates. the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. LP-50 showed significantly increased inhibitory activities against a panel of NL4-3 Env-based pseudoviruses carrying single or combined T-20-induced resistance mutations. both the new lipopeptides showed significantly higher IC50s against these mutants than against the wild-type (WT) and T-20-sensitive (D36G) viruses. LP-50 and LP-51 sustained their inhibitory activities at low nanomolar or subnanomolar concentrations. l4-3V38A/N42T 2,756 831.37 1,745.13 84.18 60.32 7.89 8.3 0.88 NL4-3E49K/N126K 470.97 34.19 648.93 21.12 0.16 0.03 0.1 0.03 HIV-2 or SIV HIV-2ROD 496.73 14.53 1,582.33 271.65 0.09 0.01 0.08 0.02 HIV-2ST 1,395.44 429.91 >5,000 7.01 LP-50 and LP-51 inhibited HIV-2 isolate ST with IC50s of 7.01 and 1.7 nM. T-20, LP-40, LP-50, and LP-51 had IC50s of 1,395.44 and >5,000 nM. all the inhibitors had no inhibitory activities against a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped virus at 2,000 nM. rhesus monkeys were subcutaneously injected into six healthy rhesus monkeys. each inhibitor was subcutaneously injected into six healthy rhesus monkeys. LP-40 reached a low serum peak level at 4 h after administration. dilution that inhibited 50% of virus infection was 40-fold. LP-50 and LP-51 have extremely potent and long-lasting in vivo antiviral activities. each of the inhibitors was subcutaneously injected into six rhesus monkeys at 3 mg/kg. each of the inhibitors was subcutaneously injected into six rhesus monkeys at different time points before or after injection. simian-human immunodeficiency virus treatment was initiated on day 11 after virus inoculation. 15 monkeys were subcutaneously injected with normal saline (A), LP-50 (B) or LP-51 (group H) once daily for 4 weeks. plasma viral loads of monkeys reached the highest levels (average, 7.61 log10 RNA copies/ml) and then declined naturally. monkeys treated with LP-50, LP-51, and normal saline control were measured at different time points by quantitative PCR. the plasma viral load precipitated below the detection limit at day 7 after the treatment. viral replication was fully controlled, declining to undetectable levels. efficacy was retained until 14 days after LP-51 was withdrawn. pilot structurally interrupted treatment of rhesus monkeys chronically infected with SHIVSF162P3. -50 was generated by introducing multiple pairs of glutamic acid and lysine residues (EK motif) in the solvent-accessible sites (b, c and f, g) of LP-40 to promote the formation of intrahelical salt bridges per helix turn. LP-50 was further modified by introducing amino acids from the sequences of HIV-2 and SIV into its NHR-binding positions. the positions and sequences corresponding to the T20-resistant site and pocket-forming site in the NHR are shown in blue. the positions and sequences corresponding to the M-T hook structure, pocket-binding domain, and TRM in the CHR are shown in green, red, and purple, respectively. a large panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses with their Envs representing the worldwide AIDS epidemic was constructed. LP-50 and LP-51 inhibited divergent HIV-1 subtypes with mean IC50s of 22 and 26 pM. both new inhibitors, like LP-40, had a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of >140 M. the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. 5 275 13 1 11 3 B01 B\u2032 89,185 6,922 8,630 1,053 76 7 93 6 B02 B\u2032 9,283 2,120 975 60 23 2 29 5 B04 B\u2032 5,355 568 1,272 117 23 6 44 3 43-22 B\u2032 30,648 2,054 1,354 662 5 1 8 2 Du156 C 14,433 2,125 10,538 724 6 0 8 1 ZM53 M.PB12 C 25,809 8,7 LP-50 and LP-51 are highly potent inhibitors of T-20-resistant HIV-1 mutants as well as HIV-2 and SIV isolates. LP-50 and LP-51 displayed dramatically increased inhibitory activities against a panel of NL4-3 Env-based pseudoviruses carrying single or combined T-20. LP-50 and LP-51 showed much better inhibition than LP-50. both the new lipopeptides also showed significantly higher IC50s against these mutants than against the wild-type (WT) and D36G. the assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. we determined the inhibitory activities of LP-50 and LP-51 against HIV-2, SIV and SHIV isolates. LP-51 inhibited HIV-2 isolate ROD at IC50s of 0.09 and 0.08 nM. LP-50 and LP-51 inhibited HIV-2 isolate ST with IC50s of 7.01 and 1.7 nM. T-20, LP-40, LP-50, and LP-51 had IC50s of 1,395.44 and >5,000 nM. LP-50 and LP-51 exhibit exceptionally potent and long-lasting ex vivo antiviral activities. each inhibitor was subcutaneously injected into six healthy rhesus monkeys. dilution that inhibited 50% of virus infection was 40-fold, similar to that of the prodrug T-20 (46-fold), determined previously (20) LP-51 showed serum dilutions of 34,481-fold after 48 h and 1,122-fold after 72 h. LP-19 had serum dilutions of 200-fold after 48 h and 40-fold after 72 h. LP-50 and LP-51 have extremely potent and long-lasting in vivo antiviral activities. rhesus monkeys were infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVSF162P3) treatment was initiated on day 11 after virus inoculation. the plasma viral loads of monkeys reached the highest levels (average, 7.61 log10 RNA copies/ml) but LP-50 or LP-51 treatment sharply accelerated the decline rate relative to that for the normal-saline group. rhesus monkeys were subcutaneously treated with normal saline (A), LP-50 (B) or LP-51 (C) once daily for 4 weeks. the plasma viral loads of monkeys were measured at different time points by quantitative PCR. a man-whitney test was performed to judge the significance of the differences during treatment. a third round of LP-51 treatment was given to monkey J0 with a reduced dosage (1 mg/kg once daily for 4 weeks) again, the viral replication was fully controlled, declining to an undetectable level. efficacy was retained until 14 days after LP-51 was withdrawn. DISCUSSION Membrane fusion is an essential step used by enveloped viruses and has been considered an ideal target for developing antiviral agents (1, 2); however, T-20 remains the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for the treatment of viral infection. sifuvirtide, sifuvirtide, CP32M, and T2635 exhibit improved activities in inhibiting both wild-type and T-20-resistant viruses (26\u201329). the pocket-binding sequence has been used for inhibitor design, but little attention has been paid to the C-terminal tryptophan-rich motif (TRM) of T-20. the mechanism of action of T-20 and its structural properties remain elusive. cholesteroylated peptide C34-Chol, with highly potent anti-HIV activity, has been reported previously (17) a single subcutaneous low dose of C34-Chol resulted in a mean change in the HIV-1 RNA load of 0.9 log10 copies/ml (41) the trial was suspended due to serious injection site reactions. the antiviral activity of C34-Chol is much lower than those of LP-50 and LP-51, especially in the inhibition of HIV-2 and SIV isolates. LP-19 was also evaluated in nonhuman primate models and demonstrated its potent therapeutic efficacies in both acute and chronic infections (20) compared to LP-19, LP-50 and LP-51 were about 20-fold more active in their in vitro potencies and 160-fold more active in their in vivo activities d viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and emerging viruses Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reagents were obtained through the AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. peptides were synthesized using a standard solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) method. the template peptide contains a C-terminal lysine residue with a 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl (Dde) side chain-protecting group. they were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromat the -helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity [] at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (33,000\u00b0 cm2 dmol1). thermal denaturation was performed by monitoring the ellipticity change at 222 nm from 20\u00b0C to 98\u00b0C at a rate of 2\u00b0C/min. culture supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. TCID50 was determined in TZM-bl cells. ex vivo anti-HIV activities of lipopeptide inhibitors were evaluated. 21 adult rhesus macaques were screened to be negative for SIV, herpes B virus, and simian T-lymphotropic virus. macaques were intravenously inoculated with 1,000 TCID50 of virus. macaques were subcutaneously administered 1 ml of LP-50 at 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg once daily for 4 weeks. all animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) prior to the procedures. the experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. cells and plasmids were obtained through the AIDS Reagent Program. peptides were synthesized using a standard solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) method. the template peptide contains a C-terminal lysine residue with a 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl (Dde) side chain-protecting group. CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-815) using a 1-nm bandwidth with a 1-nm step resolution from 195 to 270 nm at room temperature. the -helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity [] at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (33,000\u00b0 cm2 dmol1) s on a panel of HIV-1 and SIV pseudoviruses were measured by single-cycle infection assays described previously (20, 23) a pseudovirus was generated via the cotransfection of HEK293T cells with an Env-expressing plasmid and a backbone plasmid encoding an Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome. culture supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. 21 adult rhesus macaques were screened to be negative for SIV, herpes B virus, and simian T-lymphotropic virus. macaques were intravenously inoculated with 1,000 TCID50 of virus. for the treatment of chronic infection, macaques were subcutaneously injected once daily for 4 weeks beginning on day 11 after virus inoculation. all monkeys were housed and fed in an association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care (AAALAC)-accredited facility. all animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride."}
