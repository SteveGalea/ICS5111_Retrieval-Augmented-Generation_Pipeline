{"summary": "a common fear is that a highly transmissible and virulent virus will spread pandemically among humans, causing widespread mortality and economic damage. there is a strong motivation to understand and predict virus emergence. emergence probabilities are highly sensitive towards the type of mutation(s) required to productively infect a novel host. phage 6 is a dsRNA virus with a tripartite genome divided into Small (2,948 bp), Medium (4,061 bp) and Large (6,374 bp) segments [12]\u2013[14]. Mutations allowing 6 to infect novel hosts have been localized to the gene encoding the P3 protein on the Medium segment [11], [15]. novel host, P. pseudoalcaligenes, sequenced the entire P3 gene for each of them to determine the number, location, and frequency of host range expanding genotypes. we quantified plaque size on P. pseudoalcaligenes, reproductive capacity (fitness) and host attachment rate on both the canonical host and the novel host, P. pseudoalcaligenes. all phages and bacteria were propagated in lysogeny broth at pH 7. culture flasks were incubated with shaking (120 rpm) for 18 hours. bacteria achieved stationary-phase density (6109 cells mL1) lysates were mixed 11 (v/v) with 80% glycerol and were stored at 20\u00b0C. each plaque represents the descendants of a single phage. a 6 lysate was serially diluted and plated on a PP lawn. a single plaque was picked at random and placed in 1 mL LB. 100 L of the plaque suspension was added to 20 L ERA and 3 mL top agar. PCR product was purified for sequencing using ExoSAP-It (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) PCR product was sequenced in both directions with a minimum of 3-fold replication (6-fold coverage) sequencing was performed at the DNA Analysis Facility on science Hill at Yale University. row shows the number of mutants with a particular genotype. the last row shows the number of times a mutation appears among all mutants. 105 phages were added to 3108 host cells in 10 mL LB. they were incubated at 25\u00b0C with rotary shaking for 24 hrs. all assays were replicated 5x. attachment rate constant (k) is calculated as where Ni is the total number of phage added, Nf is the number of unattached phage, and t is the incubation time in minutes. Default parameters were used for the I-TASSER submission. two other nonpermissive hosts, P. syringae pv. tomato (hereafter TOM) and P. syringae pv. atrofaciens (hereafter ATRO) were used in some assays. all phages and bacteria were propagated in lysogeny broth. the number of plaques forming units per mL was obtained by multiplying the number of plaques times the dilution factor. each plaque represents the descendants of a single phage in the parent population. NOVA model with host as a factor was applied post-hoc to ascertain significant differences between mean mutant frequencies on each host type. a 6 lysate was serially diluted and plated on a PP lawn. a single plaque was picked at random and placed in 1 mL LB. three sets of oligonucleotide primers were used for PCR amplification of the region encoding the P3 host attachment protein. PCR product was sequenced in both directions with minimum of 3-fold replication (6-fold coverage) row shows the number of times a given mutation appears among all mutants. the last row shows the number of times a given mutation appears among all mutants. 105 phages were added to 3108 host cells in 10 mL LB. all assays were replicated 5x. lysates were obtained by centrifuging 3 mL culture at RCF = 2.75g. attachment rate constant is calculated as where Ni is the total number of phage added, Nf is the number of unattached phage, C is the concentration of bacteria, and t is the incubation time in minutes. Default parameters were used for the I-TASSER submission. rates on TOM and ATRO were 1.39107 (n = 21, SD 1.489108) and 4.45107 (n = 21, SD1.001107) respectively. compared means were significantly different from each other. three HRMs had no mutations in the sequenced region of the genome. 87% of all mutants possessed a mutation at the 8th amino acid residue in the P3 protein. only 9 mutants (4 single, 1 double, 1 triple and 3 unknowns) did not show a mutation at the 8th residue. this imbalance is higher than was observed in duffy et al.'s study. a putative hydrophobic anchoring domain (HAD) is shown in orange. the hydrophobic anchoring domain penetrates 6's outer lipid membrane to bind inner membrane protein P6. combining frequency is percentage of total substitutions a particular substitution was observed. others category includes substitutions found outside substitution hotspots.

[39] Ferris et al. estimated the total number of possible mutations that allow 6 to infect a novel host, P. glycinea. the coupon collector's problem can be informally stated as: Given n coupons, how many coupons will need to be sampled before each coupon is observed at least once [44]. 8 of 17 of our unique genotypes were only unique because of second- or third-site mutations. we only found 3 unique sensu stricto substitutions not found by Duffy et al. study. mutation hotspots are evidence of strong positive selection for substitutions. this is because the host binding domain is diametrically opposite the hydrophobic anchoring domain (residues 271\u2013291) predicted by DAS. mutations may alter the host-binding domain's electrical charge from negative to positive or neutral. mutant 6 may bind the ERA host receptor, but this has not been definitively determined. mutant fitnesses on PP were much greater than those on ERA. mutations expanding the 6 host range usually reduced fitness on the original host, PP. adage that \"a jack of all trades is a master of none\" is well supported, at least among 6 host infections. the ultimate cause of host specialism or generalism remains opaque. 6 population extinction is more likely in a habitat populated by ERA than PP. a regression of phage fitness on ERA against attachment rate to ERA revealed a significant positive correlation. phylogeny may only allow coarse-grained predictions of virus host range. the number of nonsynonymous substitutions allowing host range expansion is relatively small considering the number of possible substitutions. however, the relatively high virus mutation rate allows viruses to rapidly acquire host range expanding mutations despite their relative rarity. the estimated mutation rate of 2.7106 per nucleotide per generation is slightly lower than the estimated 6 mutation rate of 2.7106 per nucleotide per generation. however, it was assumed there was only one way to revert from an amber mutation (sus297). phylogeny is a poor predictor of infectivity, at least at the fine scale level within the pseudomonads. it may be that the P. syringae strains have experienced recent coevolution with 6 or its close relatives, and thus have acquired resistance to infection to these phages. Ferris et al. estimated the total number of possible mutations that allow 6 to infect a novel host, P. glycinea [11] the coupon collector's problem of statistical theory can be informally stated as: Given n coupons, how many coupons will need to be sampled before each coupon is observed at least once [44] if 1.3% of all possible nonsynonymous substitutions allowed 6 to infect ERA, we would expect to see more unique genotypes among our isolates. some mutations occur more frequently than expected by chance even if differences in transitions and transversions are accounted for. 85% of all mutations identified by our study and by Duffy et al. [15] were found in just three regions (near 8th, 133rd and 554th residues) of the P3 gene. we propose that this region of the protein is a host-binding domain and directly interacts with host receptors. mutant 6 is presumably well adapted to native but not novel hosts. mutant fitnesses on PP were much greater than those on ERA. mutant fitnesses on PP were much greater than those on ERA. mutations expanding the 6 host range usually reduced fitness on the original host. adage that \"a jack of all trades is a master of none\" is well supported, at least among 6 host infections. the ultimate cause of host specialism or generalism remains opaque. 6 population extinction is more likely in a habitat populated by ERA than one populated by PP [17]. mutant strains most likely isogenic outside the host attachment protein region. differences in fitness expected to result mainly from differences in binding efficiency to the host receptor. a relatively high virus mutation rate allows viruses to rapidly acquire host range expanding mutations despite their relative rarity. pleiotropy among host range mutations is common among host range mutations."}
