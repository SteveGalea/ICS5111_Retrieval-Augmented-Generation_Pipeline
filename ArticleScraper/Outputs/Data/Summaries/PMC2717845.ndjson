{"summary": "clinical diagnosis of most cancers is predominantly based on phenotypic markers such as appearance of cell nuclei. cancer arises as a result of successive genetic changes altering cellular processes including growth, angiogenesis, senescence, and apoptosis. high grade dysplasia is considered the most advanced dysplasia with atypical changes in many of the cells. more than 50% of the cells have large, spotted nuclei and are frequently dividing while the cellular cytoplasm is reduced and looks abnormal. cancer of the cervix was one of the most common causes of cancer death for american women. gene products are candidates for antibody testing and optical contrast agent development. imatinib is most effective against cancers carrying the bcr-Abl translocation. gene biomarkers have a significant impact in cancer detection and therapy. the field of molecular imaging is rapidly developing imaging agents with high affinity and specificity for targeted biomarkers. a number of optical techniques have been established including confocal microscopy and multispectral fluorescence imaging. biomarker imaging may be used for real-time screening, diagnosis, and detection of disease recurrence and progression. contrast agents based on metal nanoparticles, organic fluorescent dyes, and quantum dots coupled to monoclonal antibodies against cancer specific biomarkers are being developed. neoplastic and non-neoplastic untyped cervical tissue analysed 16 long-SAGE libraries. 4 from normal cervical tissue samples, 3 of a mild dysplasia (CINI), 3 of moderate dysplasia (CINII) and 6 of severe dysplasia (CINIII) sion number CINIII GACCCAAGATAAAAGAA 704 16 PIGR 22.4 NM_002644 ATCCCCCTGGGCATCGG 52 2 SLC39A3 13.2 NM_144564 ACTCAGACCAGGTCCCA 94 4 STRA6 11.4 NM_022369 ACACAGTATTCGCTCTT 44 2 ITR 11.2 NM_180989 TTACTTCCCACCCCTATA 84 4 FADS2 10.7 XYD3 2.0 NM_005971 CINI GCACCTGTCGCCCAGTG 42 2 ANPEP 36.5 NM_001150 ATGTTAATAAAATAGGC 66 4 GPC4 28.7 NM_001448 ATAAATGATTAGACTAC 32 2 CLIC6 27.8 NM_053277 GGCCAAGAACTTTCACT 28 2 C14orf101 24.3 NM_017799 GACCCAAGATAAAAGAA 1,101,702 total longSAGE tags in four normal libraries, GEO Alias N3, N1, N2, N4; 2,165,777 total longSAGE tags in six CINIII libraries, GEO Alias C1, C3, C2, C4, C5, C6; 785,642 total longSAGE tags in three CINI libraries.

TSPAN1, upregulated in CINIII almost 10-fold, also plays a role in cell motility and growth. this knowledge expands the possibilities for rapid visualization between normal and stages of dysplasia in vivo. the group of trefoil factor peptides (TFF1-3) are part of the protective mechanism operating in the intestinal mucosa and play a fundamental role in epithelial protection, repair, and restitution. that VANGL1 returned to cell membranes within 45 minutes of TFF3 stimulation (Kalabis et al. 2005) the complex is located at the cell surface and is essential to cell shape and motility through lamellipodial actin assembly and protrusion. the complex is located at the cell surface and is essential to cell shape and motility through lamellipodial actin assembly and protrusion. CD74 CD74 molecule, major histocompatibility complex MHC, class II invariant chain. CD74 is a regulated intra-membrane proteolysis RIP protein. its roles as a chaperone and signalling molecule are tightly regulated. CEACAM1 has 74.3% identity to CEACAM5 (702 residues) in 412 residue overlap. gene encodes a member of the chloride intracellular channel family of proteins. gene encodes a member of the chloride intracellular channel family. gene OTOF is the second member of a mammalian gene family related to C. elegans fer-1. it encodes a predicted cytosolic protein with a single carboxyterminal trans-membrane domain. gene otoferlin suggests its involvement in vesicle membrane fusion. FGFR2 is a high-affinity receptor for acidic, basic and/or keratinocyte growth factor, depending on the isoform. extra-cellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are composed of a membrane-associated protein core substituted with a variable number of heparan sulfate chains. these proteins may play a role in the control of cell division and growth regulation. ITR G protein-coupled receptor 180 is produced predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells. only Fc gamma RI has high affinity for ligand and has a unique third extra-cellular domain (EC3). /neurotoxin gene family members are lymphocyte antigens that attach to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. LYNX1 can enhance nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine. it is a new marker for human breast cancer. PIGR polymeric immunoglobulin receptor mediates trans-cellular transport of polymeric immunoglobulin molecules. the receptor has 5 units with homology to the variable (V) units of immunoglobulins and a trans-membrane region. the PROM1 antigen appears to belong to a new molecular family of 5-TM proteins. it includes an extra-cellular N-terminus, two short intracellular loops and two large extra-cellular loops. no natural ligand has yet been demonstrated for the PROM1 molecule. signal-regulatory-protein (SIRPA) family members are receptor-type transmembrane glycoproteins known to be involved in negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled signalling processes. CD47 has been known to be a ligand for this PTPNS1 (subramanian et al. 2006). Stra6 codes for a very hydrophobic membrane protein of a new type. this gene encodes a carcinoma-associated antigen, defined by the monoclonal antibody GA733. this gene encodes a carcinoma-associated antigen. TMEM45B transmembrane protein 45B. Integral to membrane (Ensembl-Gene ENSG0000051715: inferred from electronic annotation). TMPRSS2 transmembrane protease, serine 2 is thought to be cleaved and secreted into cell media after autocleavage. the tetraspanin protein encoded by this gene is found in the asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) it can complex with other trans-membrane 4 superfamily proteins."}
