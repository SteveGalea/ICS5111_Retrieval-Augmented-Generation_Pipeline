{"summary": "four serotypes of the flavivirus dengue virus (DENV1\u20134) cause the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. 50\u2013100 million people infected annually and over 3 billion people at risk. 500,000 dengue patients require hospitalization annually, of whom a large proportion are children. anti-flavivirus monoclonal Abs (MAbs) was shown to positively correlate with neutralization activity in vitro [19], consistent with lower neutralizing activity observed with MAbs with lower affinity against variant genotypes within a single DENV serotype [23]\u2013[25] but has not been followed longitudinally. deNV3 was the dominant serotype in 2008\u20132011 [26]. we studied both 1 and 2\u00b0 DENV infections from the acute phase until 18 months (m) post-infection. we measured neutralizing Ab titers and avidity to DENV3, the currently infecting serotype, and to DENV2. we tested possible correlations between IgM and IgG avidity to DENV, total Ab titer and DENV-specific neutralization titer. IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 DENV infections were defined by an Ab titer by Inhibition ELISA of 10 or 10 in acute-phase samples, respectively [31], [37]. Neutralization assay Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 20 min. then diluted in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS at pH 8.0. data were expressed as percent infection versus log10 of the reciprocal serum dilution. a donkey anti-human IgG, Fc-fragment-specific MAb (11,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary Ab. for acute-phase samples, days 4\u20136 post-onset of symptoms were chosen. avidity was calculated as percentage of IgG or IgM bound by dividing the background-adjusted OD. two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to compare the geometric mean NT50, total Ab titer and avidity at each time-point. bivariate correlations between NT50 and NT50 and avidity were estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient at each time-point. DENV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA. isolation of DENV in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells; seroconversion of DENV-specific IgM Abs as measured by IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. neutralization assay Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 20 min. then diluted in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS at pH 8.0. data were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism 5 software. 1300 dilution of DENV2 (3.6104 pfu/ml) yielded the same OD as the 1300 DENV3. plates were coated with whole virus and incubated with heat-inactivated diluted serum samples (1100) in triplicate, then washed with urea or PBS for 10 min before adding secondary biotin-conjugated Ab. positive control was calculated for each urea concentration and each virus as follows: Statistical analysis The data were stratified by 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 infection status for analysis. geometric mean total Ab titer, percentage avidity, and NT50 were compared using the two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. 61 (56.5%) were 1\u00b0 and 47 (43.5%) were 2\u00b0 DENV infections (Table 1). disease severity was relatively low in the 2010\u20132011 season, with 27 (25.0%) DHF/DSS cases. we hypothesized that most children with 2\u00b0 DENV infections were previously infected with DENV2. the NT50 against DENV3 peaked at convalescence in both 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 cases. in 1\u00b0 infections, we observed a significant increase in NT50 from the acute to convalescent phase (p0.001) followed by a significant drop from convalescence to 3 m post-onset of symptoms (p0.0001). for 2\u00b0 infections, we measured the DENV2-specific neutralization capacity of the serum, which showed a similar trend. longitudinal serum samples were analyzed as described in Figure 1A. diamonds, mean; middle line, median; upper and lower boundary of the box, intra-quartile range (IQR); whiskers, range of values that are close enough not to be considered outliers. longitudinal serum samples were tested for DENV-specific avidity using a modified ELISA with 6M urea washes against DENV3 strain N7236 virions. mean +/ SD as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles of % IgG bound are displayed. IgG serum avidity remained high for 1\u00b0 DENV cases, while it declined for 2\u00b0 cases after the convalescent time-point. % IgG bound to DENV2 and DENV3 was compared at day 6 (acute) (A), day 14\u201328 (convalescent) (B), day 14\u201328 (convalescent) (B), day 14\u201328 (convalescent) (B), day 14\u201328 (convalescent) (B), day 14\u201328 ( correlation was observed between DENV2-specific NT50 and % IgG bound to DENV2 from the acute phase until 18 m post-infection. a positive correlation was observed between DENV2-specific NT50 and % IgG bound to DENV2 at acute and convalescent time-points. 0.0016 Convalescent 32 0.08 0.66 3 month 44 0.45 0.003 6 month 44 0.23 0.13 18 month 37 0.13 0.43 Secondary DENV2 % IgG bound vs. DENV2 NT50 Acute 36 0.44 0.007 Convalescent 31 0.44 0.013 3 month 44 0.42 0.004 6 month 44 0.57 0.0001 18 month 38 0.41 0.01 Secondary DENV2 % IgG bound vs. DENV3 NT50 patients classified as DF did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in mean NT50 or % IgG bound compared to those classified as DHF/DSS. a significant difference in total Ab titer was observed between 1\u00b0 DF and DHF/DSS cases at the convalescent time-point (p = 0.035) indicator N % Mean age SD Participants 108 100 8.43.6 Gender Female 52 48.2 8.23.7 Male 56 51.8 8.73.7 Disease classification Dengue Fever (DF) 80 74.8 8.13.6 Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DF) 25 23.4 9.14.0 Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) 2 1.9 10.70.4 Immune status Primary infection 61 56.5 6.93.6 Secondary infection 47 43.5 10.42.8 Clinical sign (proportion with sign present)* Comp for 2\u00b0 infections, we measured the DENV2-specific serum neutralizing Abs.

DENV3-specific NT50 of serum day 4\u20136 (acute), day 14\u201328 (convalescent), 3 m, 6 m and 18 m post-onset of symptoms in 1\u00b0 DENV3 infections. avidity to DENV3 was defined as the percentage (%) of IgG or IgM that remained bound after the urea washes. in 1\u00b0 DENV3 infections, we observed a large increase in IgG serum avidity to DENV3 between convalescence and 3 m post-onset of symptoms. deNV3-specific IgG serum avidity day 6 (acute), day 14\u201328 (convalescent), 3 m, 6 m and 18 m post-onset of symptoms in 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections. % IgG bound to DENV2 and DENV3 was compared at day 6. the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare % IgG bound in serum to DENV2 and DENV3 Nicaraguan viruses. the ability of serum to neutralize a virus can depend on Ab concentration and/or serum avidity [32], among other parameters. a positive correlation was observed between DENV-specific total Ab titers and NT50 against DENV3 in the acute phase of 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections. correlation between DENV3-specific NT50 and IgG avidity to DENV3 in the acute phase of 1\u00b0 DENV3 infections (A); correlation between DENV3-specific NT50 and IgG avidity to DENV3 in the acute phase of 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections (B); and correlation between DENV3-specific NT50 and IgG avidity to DENV3 3 m post-onset of symptoms in 2\u00b0 DENV3 infections (C).

LLPC niches are limited in the bone marrow, and newly formed LLPCs can replace LLPCs formed during earlier infections. decrease in serum IgG avidity to DENV3 at 18 m time-point could be explained by a strong extra-follicular response induced by the presence of pre-existing anti-DENV Abs in 2\u00b0 infections. cross-reactive Abs contribute to neutralization of acute 2\u00b0 DENV infections. this is consistent with isolation of strongly neutralizing cross-reactive MAbs from 2\u00b0 DENV infections. we also observed a correlation between IgG serum avidity to DENV2 and DENV2-specific NT50. cross-reactive serum avidity dominates the acute 2\u00b0 DENV response. avidity to the current infecting serotype becomes dominant over time. future studies will address the relation of avidity and NT50 to infection outcome and disease severity.
