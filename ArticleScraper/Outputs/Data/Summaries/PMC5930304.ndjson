{"summary": "coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell on restructured membranes (1, 2). the RTC replicates genomic RNA (gRNA) and transcribes subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) during viral infection. sgRNAs are almost completely excluded from virions, despite having identical 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends as the gRNA. a subsequent report on the PS identified a 95-bp stem-loop structure within the previously described 190-bp region (7). more recent studies utilizing 20 synonymous mutations predicted to abolish the PS stem-loop structure demonstrated that the secondary structure of the PS was necessary for selective packaging during MHV infection (8). rJHMV packaging signal predicts RNA secondary structure of MHV. HA epitope coding sequence and complement are boldfaced and underlined. infected mice were monitored for survival (D) and weight loss (E) for 14 dpi. infection with lineage A betacoronaviruses provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of selective packaging in vivo. this study establishes the PS as a novel virulence factor for MHV, and likely other coronaviruses. this study establishes the PS as a novel virulence factor for MHV. rA59Nsp15-HA-infected mice had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to wild-type rA59 (rA59WT) mice were infected with rJHMVNsp15-HA by intracranial injection and monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) for 10 dpi. rJHMVNsp15-HA had growth kinetics in vitro equivalent to that of rJHMVWT five- to 8-week-old mice were infected by intracranial inoculation of 700 PFU of rA59PS or rA59WT. mice were monitored for weight loss (C) and survival (D) for 12 dpi. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. mutants have synonymous mutations throughout the PS. predicted to alter the stem-loop structure of the PS without changing the amino acid sequence of nsp15. rJHMVNsp15-HA was cleared by 9 dpi and cleared by 11 dpi. rJHMVPS titers decreased on 9 dpi and were cleared by 11 dpi. both PS mutant viruses did not reach the same peak viral titers as wild-type JHMV. rA59PS and rA59Nsp15-HA virions have increased sgRNA and cellular RNA packaged into virions. rA59PS-, rA59Nsp15-HA-, and rA59WT-infected 17Cl-1 cells were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. intracellular RNA was isolated from 17Cl-1 monolayers using Trizol. ratios of +sgRNA7 (A) and sgRNA7 (B) to gRNA were calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. the ratio of HPRT to gRNA was calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. the elevated levels of sgRNA in virions may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may be sensed during entry, replication, or packaging of PS mutants. we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) because they are easily culturable and are highly susceptible to MHV. levels of IFN-I (A and C) and gRNA (B and D) were measured by qRT-PCR. the average and standard error of the mean for six biological replicates are plotted from two independent experiments. increased levels of IFN-I in BMMs following rA59PS infection suggested that IFN-I signaling would be important for rA59PS or rJHMVPS attenuation. five- to 8-week-old male IFNAR/ B6 mice were infected with 3 104 PFU of rJHMVPS or rJHMVWT by intranasal inoculation. infected mice were monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) for 14 dpi. rJHMVWT caused a lethal infection in MAVS/ mice. but rJHMVPS remained attenuated, causing moderate weight loss. MHV induces significant levels of IFN-I in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR7 signaling, contributing to protection (17). infected mice were monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) five- to 8-week-old male mice were infected with 1 104 PFU of either rJHMVPS or rJHMVWT by intranasal injection. a protective level of IFN-I was still produced in infected mice. in contrast, MDA5/ mice infected with MHV had decreased but detectable levels of IFN-I. the expression of many ISGs was not altered during MHV infection of MDA5/ mice (18). rA59Nsp15-HA-infected mice had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to wild-type rA59 (rA59WT) mice were infected with rJHMVNsp15-HA by intracranial injection and monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) for 10 dpi. rJHMVNsp15-HA had growth kinetics in vitro equivalent to that of rJHMVWT five- to 8-week-old mice were infected by intracranial inoculation of 700 PFU of rA59PS or rA59WT. mice were monitored for weight loss (C) and survival (D) for 12 dpi. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. mutants have synonymous mutations throughout the PS. predicted to alter the stem-loop structure of the PS without changing the amino acid sequence of nsp15. growth kinetics of two independent rJHMVPS clones was nearly identical to that of rJHMVWT in vitro. rJHMVNsp15-HA-infected mice decreased in the CNS compared to those infected with rJHMVWT. rJHMVPS titers decreased on 9 dpi and were cleared by 11 dpi. both PS mutant viruses did not reach the same peak viral titers as wild-type JHMV. rA59PS and rA59Nsp15-HA have increased sgRNA and cellular RNA packaged into virions. virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. intracellular RNA was isolated from the 17Cl-1 monolayers. ratios of +sgRNA7 (A) and sgRNA7 (B) to gRNA were calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. the ratio of HPRT to gRNA was calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. the elevated levels of sgRNA, especially \u2013sgRNA, in virions may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may be sensed during entry, replication, or packaging of PS mutants. we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) because they are easily culturable and are highly susceptible to MHV. levels of IFN-I (A and C) and gRNA (B and D) were measured by qRT-PCR. the average and standard error of the mean for six biological replicates are plotted from two independent experiments. increased levels of IFN-I in rA59PS-infected BMMs suggested that IFN-I signaling would be important for rA59PS or rJHMVPS attenuation. five- to 8-week-old male IFNAR/ B6 mice were infected with 3 104 PFU of rJHMVPS or rJHMVWT by intranasal inoculation. infected mice were monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) for 14 dpi. rJHMVWT caused a lethal infection in MAVS/ mice. but rJHMVPS remained attenuated, causing moderate weight loss. MHV induces significant levels of IFN-I in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR7 signaling, contributing to protection (17). infected mice were monitored for survival (A) and weight loss (B) five- to 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were infected with 1 104 PFU of either rJHMVPS or rJHMVWT by intranasal inoculation. a protective level of IFN-I was still produced in infected MAVS/ or TLR7/ mice. the lineage A betacoronaviruses, specifically MHV, provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of viral packaging on virulence. the location of the stem-loop structure within the nsp15 locus allows these coronaviruses to selectively package gRNA and not coterminal sgRNA or host RNA. rA59Nsp15-HA maintained the overall structure, the pentaloop, and one of the 2-nucleotide (nt) bulges. levels of packaged RNA would be predicted to closely mimic those present in the intracellular environment. however, the ratio of both \u2013sgRNA7 and GAPDH to gRNA was increased in virions but did not reach intracellular ratios. the relative lack of \u2013sgRNA7 packaging may reflect its localization to membranous structures associated with replication. mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibody were more susceptible to rJHMVPS. this suggests that IFN-I signaling was still responsible for rJHMVPS attenuation. sgRNAs could act as PAMPs during replication and/or entry of MHV packaging mutants. selective packaging of gRNA plays an important role in the virulence of MHV and probably other lineage A betacoronaviruses. this work uncovers a unique method by which an RNA virus shields its RNA products from the host to prevent an innate immune response. the localization of the packaging signal for most coronaviruses is unknown. mice were bred in the animal care facility at the university of Iowa. pBAC-rJHMVPS and pBAC-rJHMVNsp15-HA were created using pBAC-rJHM.IA, by Red recombination, and using the primers listed in Table S1. rJHMVPS and rJHMVNsp15-HA were lysed by freeze-thawing. the sequence of each clone was confirmed. no coding mutations were present in either clone. ligated DNAs and N protein transcript were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit. transfected cells were plated in D10 and monitored for cytopathic effects. rA59PS P0 stocks were used to generate rA59PS P1 stocks. 5- to 8-week-old male mice were sedated and infected intracranially with 700 PFU. all infected mice were weighed and monitored for 2 weeks and euthanized if the mouse dropped below 70% of initial body weight or became dehydrated. cDNAs for all RNAs except sgRNAs were prepared using Trizol (Fisher Scientific) supernatants were overlaid on 30% sucrose in Na-Tris buffer. centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. cDNA for viral RNAs was generated using Superscript IV. cDNA for cellular RNA from infected monolayers was isolated. male and female mice were euthanized and bone marrow was isolated from each femur and tibia. a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% agarose and D2 with 1% neutral red was applied for 4 h at 37\u00b0C before counting plaques. low-serum medium is the same as D10 with 2% fetal calf serum (D2). mice were bred in the animal care facility at the University of Iowa. pBAC-rJHMVPS and pBAC-rJHMVNsp15-HA were created using pBAC-rJHM.IA, by Red recombination. pBAC.IAPS or pBAC.IANsp15-HA was cotransfected with plasmid expressing N protein into BHK-MHVR cells using Lipofectamine 2000. rJHMVPS and rJHMVNsp15-HA were then passaged 3 times to obtain working stocks. the linearized plasmid was recombined using the homologous arms and the In-Fusion cloning kit. the PS mutations were screened for by PCR and sequencing. the plasmid was digested with BsmBI and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. for rJHMV infections, 5- to 8-week-old male mice were sedated and infected intracranially with 700 PFU. all infected mice were weighed and monitored for 2 weeks and euthanized if the mouse dropped below 70% of initial body weight or became dehydrated. infected 17Cl-1 supernatants were collected at 20 hpi. supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 g and filtered through a 0.45-m filter. cDNA for viral RNAs was generated using Superscript IV. a 1:1 ratio of 1.2% agarose and D2 was applied to cells. cells were returned to D2 medium for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. after incubation, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 2% methanol. -Cox tests (*, P 0.05)"}
