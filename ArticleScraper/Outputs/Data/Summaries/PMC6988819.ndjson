{"summary": "goal of this review is to analyze the geospatial point-of-care testing (POCT) solutions in Table 1 (1\u201377), while addressing key issues and determining how the different solutions can help meet public health challenges. the long-term mission is to prepare public health practitioners and laboratory medicine professionals to collaboratively employ geospatial tools and POCT. newdemics demand dynamic value strategies in complex adaptive systems. POCT allows demographic care units to continue serving critically ill clusters of people by relocating diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic resources through fast, patient-focused, and disease-specific evidence. st Point of Care 2010 (5) rural Isaan, Thailand Emergency cardiac biomarkers and point-of-care testing are warranted in rural SWNs. the research led to implementation of POC cardiac biomarker testing throughout Thailand in over 500 sites with over 700 instruments. the lack of connectivity and SWN strategies, combined with communication failures during early stages of the relief effort must be addressed for future disaster preparedness. the authors present a combined epidemiological and economic model for control of diseases spreading on local and SWNs. the effectiveness of local (ring-vaccination or culling) and global control strategies is analyzed by comparing the net present values of the combined cost of preventive treatment. health facilities should be available in border areas and at entry points in order to perform HIV POC screening of migrants, tourists, traders, and traffickers. the authors transformed the Kalasin SWN(p) to its SWN(t) the authors studied the impact of a strategic hub on the SWN(t) of Nan Province. a cluster of five community hospitals can send patients to the regional hub at Pua Crowne Prince Hospital in a tiered system of referral. global health problems are elevating POCT to new levels of importance for accelerating diagnosis and evidence-based decision making during disease outbreaks. the authors present a vision where POCT accelerates an Ebola SCP and future molecular diagnostics enable facilitated-access self-testing. bolster educational outreach, improve patient access to evidence-based primary, emergency, and hospital care. it is time for insightful leadership and participative outreach to bridge professional disciplines. steward POC into a brilliant new future. the lack of HbA1c testing in central Vietnam decreases the ability to monitor patient response to treatment in limited-resource settings. accessible online training, public health teamwork, an appropriately detailed spatial care path, and POC measurement of HbA1c with target levels set for the Vietnamese population. TU testing locations were clustered near high AIDS rate areas. staff strategies included keeping clients with them while rapid test results were processed. TB testing included skin testing and interferon gamma release assays. malaria incidence in northern Namibia in 2009 using Bayesian conditional-autoregressive spatial\u2013temporal models. rapid diagnostic tests were used to examine blood samples from most patients at primary health facilities. spatial distribution of reported cases indicates higher caseloads in the northern regions. using GISs we can understand how populations utilize health networks, visualize their inefficiencies, and model alternatives. we present visual logistics from GIS analyses in the Eyre Peninsula, Australia; Pernambuco State, Brazil; Palawan Island, Philippines; Hualien County, Taiwan; and Nan Province, Thailand. importantly, use of POC cardiac biomarkers (cTn T and I) in south Australia will provide more equitable care. the authors analyzed distance/time/economic metrics for POC diagnosis in Hualien, an eastern seaboard county vulnerable to typhoons. the authors compared the cost of placing POC VL instruments at or near facilities to the cost of an expanded sample transportation network. Isolation Laboratories, Diagnostics Isolators, and Mobile Laboratories for Highly Infectious Diseases are highly recommended. the experience highlights the need for (a) FDA-cleared tests, (b) compact instruments, (c) direct whole-blood measurement, (d) consolidation of test clusters appropriate for the support of critically ill with highly infectious diseases, and (e) spatially discrete \u201csafe houses\u201d for POCT. isolation laboratory enhances safety, temperature and humidity controlled to within reagent and instrument specifications to simultaneously assure accurate POC test results. authors conclude limited access to portable diagnostic assays will be...terminated more efficiently...through greater access to portable, easy-to-use diagnostic assays. mobile laboratories can strengthen epidemiological surveillance and contribute to containing outbreaks of emerging diseases in sub-saharan Africa. rapid deploymentable laboratory units can bring the diagnosis closer to the outbreak site and significantly shorten the time to delivery of results, thus facilitating epidemic containment. A Practical Guide to Global POCT 2016 (44) Fundamental designs and isolation laboratories built into hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand Enhancing standards of care using innovative point-of-care testing. the floor plan embeds POCT to be used in support of patients being screened for EVD and for those seriously ill and in need of critical care while in isolation. a simulated rescue of patients with chest pain flown to the marsal Islands produced falsely lower cTnI results. a regionalized clinical cardiac support network was implemented in non-metropolitan South Australia using standardized risk stratification and evidence-based treatment protocols. a consultant cardiologist with redundancy to ensure response within 10 min with facsimile-based electrocardiogram interpretation. authors observed improvement in 30-day mortality for patients presenting to rural hospitals and diagnosed with myocardial infarction. these interventions closed the gap in mortality between rural and metropolitan patients in south Australia. the speaker identified needs for diagnostic testing to support individuals inhabiting the Mars colony. the bio-Analyzer provides test results from blood, urine, and saliva samples within 2\u20133 h reducing need to freeze and return samples to Earth. the bio-Analyzer provides test results from blood, urine, and saliva samples from space within 2\u20133 h. a biosensor used by an italian astronaut during the VITA mission, July-December 2017, demonstrated the feasibility of performing sensitive lateral flow immunoassay analysis of salivary cortisol down to 0.4 ng/mL directly onboard the International Space Station. mobile telephones facilitate case detections in multiple locations, thereby saving time. the system can be expanded throughout the country to support rapid strategic targeting of interventions. the authors present a scalable, generic wireless color detector for POC diagnostics in resource-limited settings. a mass-producible, low-cost, paper-based solution for result readout and wireless communication was developed. researchers introduce portable biochemical analysis for rapid field deployment of nucleic acid-based diagnostics using quadcopter drones. the DNA/RNA system costs $50, enabling deployment to field sites. successful in-flight replication of Staphylococcus aureus and -phage DNA targets is 20 min. scores reflect lack of primary care units, hospital beds, medical doctors, registered nurses, technical nurses, pharmacists, and medical technologists. the higher the score, the worse the situation. the authors invented a scoring metric for health resources, poverty levels, and diagnosticians. Phang Nga province, Coastal Thailand, was the hardest hit southern coastal province after the 2004 earthquake/Tsunami. the authors studied POCT and O2 saturation monitoring in Phang Nga, the hardest hit southern coastal province, to develop preparedness strategies for low-resource SWNs. the risk map helps design spatial grids comprising SWNs, GISs, and topomaps with POCT embedded at essential nodal points to help contain Ebola outbreaks. investigators mapped the risk of Ebola infection in Sub-Saharan Africa from the west coast (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) across the DRC to the east coast (Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania) the hybrid laboratory, therapeutic turnaround time, critical limits, performance maps, and Knowledge Optimization\u00ae are distributed. clinically integrated testing, bedside and near-patient testing, customized test clusters, minimized TTAT, optimized temporal and Dx-Rx processes, the total quality principle, collaborative teamwork, increased productivity, and especially evidence-based medicine and improved outcomes. POCT must fulfill healthcare needs on a daily basis, improve diagnostic skills, and enable public health, emergency medicine, and other personnel with fast decision making. for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, POCT must fulfill healthcare needs on a daily basis, improve diagnostic skills, and enable public health, emergency medicine, and other personnel with fast decision making. definitions point-of-care testing is defined as diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care (78, 79) it is inherently spatial, that is, performed at or near points of need, and also intrinsically temporal, because it produces fast actionable results. the definition does not depend on the size or format of the handheld, portable, or transportable instrument, test module, or assay design. geospatial science mappings show where, when, and how to position POCT optimally, create mobile rapid response, and implement the solutions in Table 1. the reader can find detailed discussions of geospatial theory, software apps, and analytical techniques in Ferguson et al. PubMed, the World-wide Web, web sites of educational institutions, and other relevant sources were searched for papers, articles, chapters, documents, flowcharts, maps, and schematics. the reader can find detailed discussions of geospatial theory, software apps, and analytical techniques in Ferguson et al. (28\u201330) the current situation in the DRC is no exception. Table 1 also covers physical spatial designs needed to address safe handling of highly infectious threats and care for infected patients. scale-free networks have hubs of connectivity that shape the way the network operates. most nodes in a SWN are not neighbors, but can be reached in a few steps. local hubs represent an advantage when planning POCT sites. Figure 2 illustrates the process of discovering the characteristics and infrastructure of a SWN in rural impoverished provinces in Isaan, northeast Thailand. interdependencies often cross established boundaries and bridge international borders through fluxes of supplies, laborers, professional personnel, and also, communicable diseases. emergency room physician could rule in diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction using POC cTn testing. if elevated cTnT rules in acute coronary syndrome, patients are referred to the Kalasin Regional Hospital. otherwise, patients are referred to the regional hospital, but transportation is prolonged. a hub hospital can improve efficiency by decreasing transit times indicated by temporal contours. a surprise outcome in Nan Province was that nursing staff in the most northern regions adjacent to Laos PDR in Chaloem Phra Kiat Community Hospital insisted POCT be implemented. rapid response testing can facilitate patient workup and case reporting. influx of workers with HIV and possibly TB into the SWN from across a natural geographic border. 80% of community population should be diagnosed and ideally treated, in primary care sites outside the hospital. 80% of community population should be diagnosed and ideally treated, in primary care sites outside the hospital, in order to prevent saturation of emergency rooms that simply cannot handle huge numbers of patients. a state like California should have a geospatial system. geographic isolation by the Haiti Earthquake\u2014need for spatial resilience. communities should develop their own plans for resilience that include mobile POCT and properly trained, certified, and annually validated personnel. GISs are also useful for analyzing patterns of spread of infectious diseases and dynamically interactive treatment, such as ring vaccination. geographical information system analysis of population clusters illustrate how POCT could expedite patient access to care in Hualien County, Coastal East Taiwan. in the Philippines, extremely remote Palawan Island is challenged by a similar long linear topography with poorly accessible rural northern and southern regions. CT placed inside biosafety cabinets (16, 35, 36) and conceptual designs for safe self-testing (FAST\u2022POC) and assisted testing (POC\u2022POD) Kost et al. (16, 34\u201337, 44, 83) designed an isolation laboratory with POCT inside a biosafety cabinet. the number of cases (as of October 2019) totaled 3,274 with a death toll of 2,185 and mortality of 67%. this outbreak is the second worst in the face of a response marred by war zones, shootings of health workers, civil strife, abandonment by NGOs and healthcare personnel. novel POC technologies, when used with safe specimen processing, can enhance ring vaccination. there is no task force plan to train public health students or POCT specialists in the use of EUA IVD assays. there is no task force plan to train public health students or POCT specialists in the use of EUA devices and associated quality control. Cummins et al. reviewed POC technologies suitable or potentially usable in the micro-gravity international space station, during space flight, and possibly within confined space colonies subject to different gravitational fields (52). the alternate care facility provides a discrete spatial solution that is safe for patients, healthcare personnel, and the community. screening, hospital quarantine, and specimen transport to distant referral laboratories for diagnosis slow down patient throughput. demographic care unit (DCU) gives policy makers a means of identifying the geographic locations most in need of POCT to improve standards of care (64, 65) the demographic care unit (DCU) concept gives policy makers a means of identifying the geographic locations most in need of POCT. Combined DCU and SWN analysis, educational programs, a Thai language book with chapters on POCT (96, 97) and a collaborative strategy implemented by cardiologists, academicians, and industry significantly improved the standard of care for acute coronary syndrome patients. the earthquake was the third largest ever recorded. tests on whole blood were inoperable in the Takuapa district hospital. hundreds of critically injured tsunami victims were transferred to the hospital. no blood gas testing was found in any community hospital in Phang Nga province. similar delayed and inadequate response occurred during hurricane Katrina in the united states (1), because of the complexities of the coastal topography, severe flooding, and submerged metropolitan areas. knowing patient status and diagnosis rapidly on site can speed response and allay anxiety, so medical staff can endure the nearly impossible stress. demographic care unit (DCU) can be applied to any country on a periodic basis to help identify inequities in regions of highest need. the number of people per individual health resource in each Thai province, that is, in each DCU, was, calculated utilizing the mid-year population. map on the left shows the Phang Nga Province SWN, and on the right, Khao Lak and other areas hit hardest (in red) by the tsunami generated during the 2004 Andaman (Indian) Sea Earthquake. the center identifies hospitals and healthcare resources at risk. no blood gas testing (pO2, pCO2, pH) was found in any community hospital in Phang Nga province (68) the frequency of use of pulse oximeters in community hospitals did not match that in a survey control province, Chiang Rai, in northern Thailand. the world's first national POCT policy and guidelines was published in English. the world's first national POCT policy and guidelines was published in the English language. the publication chronicles nearly three decades of spatial movement of whole-blood analysis to the bedside in the OR and ICU. the point-of-careologist performs testing and uses diagnostic results directly where he or she encounters patients in daily and emergency practice. the point-of-careologist performs testing and uses diagnostic results directly where he or she encounters patients in daily and emergency practice. the point-of-careologist also will fulfill multifunctional needs in confined spatial environments, such as the mars colony and during extended extraterrestrial voyages. geospatialPOC disasters, outbreaks, complex crises, climate warming, terrorism, and rampant shootings have emerged as global norms. the goal is to integrate principles and practice of POCT and initiate a fresh approach to public health preparedness and community resilience (105, 106) geospatial care paths with integration of POC and other tests (103) selected to meet demographic priorities can fine-tune logistics to accelerate point-of-need response and decision making. parallel knowledge of geospatial distribution of diseases can aid development, selection, and placement of POC tests specific for populations at risk. geospatialPOC preparedness should become the new norm. the building blocks in Table 1 will fill these gaps and enable rapid response solutions at points of need worldwide. geospatial solutions include isolation laboratories and diagnostics isolators for highly infectious diseases. spatially isolated laboratories and diagnostics isolators can be positioned geographically to serve regional population clusters. POCT-enabled spatial grids can locate sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of outbreaks. integration of POCT plus GIS with ring vaccination will enable unique synergism for quickly detecting sentinel cases. spatial transformations can identify POCT-facilitated (e.g., AMI ruled in by positive POC cTn testing) transport \u201cshort-cuts\u201d for critically ill patients to referral centers for cardiologist intervention. parallel analysis produces solutions for diabetes and other public health challenges. the POCT industry has grown to $31.4 billion worldwide, projected at $37.0 billion in 2021 (114). NIH-BARDA will award a $20 million prize for POC inventions addressing antimicrobial resistance (see https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/AMRChallenge) POCT industry has grown to $31.4 billion worldwide, projected at $37.0 billion in 2021 (114) NIH-BARDA will award a $20 million prize for POC inventions addressing antimicrobial resistance. the idea is to administer targeted therapy immediately to individual patients, avoid indiscriminate use of antibiotics. authors confirm being the sole contributor of this work and has approved it for publication. conflict of interest The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
