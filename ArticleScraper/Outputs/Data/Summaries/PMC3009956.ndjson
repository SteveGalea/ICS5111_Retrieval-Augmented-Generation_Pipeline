{"summary": "three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules. ability to elicit IFN- production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons. toxoplasma gondii peptides elicit HLA-A03 restricted, IFN-producing, CD8+ T cells in humans and mice. peptides administered with adjuvants reduce parasite burden in humans and mice. attenuated T. gondii tachyzoites (e.g., S48, TS-4, T-203, RPS13) have been employed for live vaccinations of non-human animals[10-15]. parasites attenuated by knockout of gene transcription recently have been proposed as a new type of attenuated vaccine candidate[13-15]. bioinformatic algorithms were used to identify peptides from tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites. the first step was to select proteins with biologic properties, such as being secreted, compatible with MHC Class I processing. the first step was to select proteins with biologic properties, such as being secreted, compatible with MHC Class I processing. all the peptides in this pool were tested with a universal T helper epitope called PADRE and a new adjuvant called GLA-SE in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. a luciferase transfected type II Prugneaud parasite was administered, followed by luciferin administration and imaging with a Xenogen camera system a week later. pKS9, LpAM9, LpRS9 and LpKS9-AM9-RS9 are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Schematic representation of the synthetic lipopeptide immunogens used in this study. the C-terminal end of a promiscuous CD4+ T cell peptide epitope was joined in sequence with the N-terminal end of one of three different T. gondii CD8 epitopes. lipopeptide vaccines LpKS9 and LpAM9 stimulated higher IFN- production than LpRS9. only results with LpKS9(KS9) and LpAM9(AM9) achieved statistical significance. mice immunized twice at intervals of three weeks. similar results were found when splenocytes from mice immunized with a lipopeptide vaccine constructed with the three peptides linked together with alanine spacers. significant IFN- production was only present with KS9 and AM9 stimulation of spleen cells. spleen cells were isolated and exposed to each individual peptide. a peptide was considered immunogenic if it induced IFN- spot formation that was significantly higher in the immunization group compared with the group inoculated with PBS. mice were immunized with peptide pools plus PADRE and Pam2Cys in GLA-SE. peptide pool and adjuvants were protected compared to control mice inocul. a total of 5-9(usually 4-5 per group) mice were tested in each control or immunization group. differences between control and immunization groups were significant. identification of new candidate T. gondii specific HLA-A*1101 epitopes. three out of 34 epitopes elicited responses greater than 50 IFN- SFC from seropositive donors PBMC, but not from seronegative donors PBMC. these peptides and the proteins from which they are derived are: STFWPCLLR (SAG2C13-21); SSAYVFSVK (SPA250-258); and AVVSLLRLLK (SPA89-98) adding proteins expressed in sporozoites and bradyzoites to 4Splenic T cell were isolated from HLA-A*03 supertype mice 10 to 14 days after peptide immunization and tested for their ability to generate IFN- in response to peptide. peptide candidates were used for screening CD8+ T cells.

HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice were immunized with peptide pools which included newly identified peptides. HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice immunized with peptide pool and adjuvants were protected compared with control mice inoculated with PBS. Mice were immunized and in a subgroup immune function was studied at the same time as the challenge shown was performed. the average population coverage by the HLA-A03 supertype is 24.51% 12.06%. the average population coverage by the HLA-A03 supertype is 24.51% 12.06%. population coverage reflects the fraction of individuals predicted to respond the epitope set inclusive of SAG1224-232 (KSFKDILPK), GRA6164-172 (AMLTAFFLR), GRA7134-142 (RSFKDLLKK), SAG2C13-21 (STFWPCLLR), SPA250-258 (SSAYVFSVK), and SPA89-98 (AVVSLLRLLK). a promiscuous CD4+ T cell peptide epitope (PADRE) was joined in sequence with the N-terminal end of one of three different resulting CD4-CD8 epitopes. the end of each resulting CD4-CD8 peptide was extended by a lysine covalently linked to one molecule of palmitic acid. this results in a four lipopeptides construct. mice were immunized with lipopeptides: LpKS9(KS9), LpAM9, LpRS9 and LpKS9-AM9-RS9. spleen cells were separated from immunized mice and stimulated by appropriate peptides. lipopeptides vaccine compared with peptide pool vaccine. mice were immunized either with lipopeptides or a mixture of peptides plus GLA-SE and Pam2Cys. spleen cells were separated from immunized mice and stimulated by appropriate peptide. mice were immunized with peptide pools that included all of the three peptides (KS9, AM9, RS9) alone or with varying adjuvants. spleen cells were isolated and exposed to each individual peptide. peptide pool with PADRE and Pam2Cys was isolated 10-14 days post-immunization. mice were immunized with peptide pools plus PADRE and Pam2Cys in GLA-SE. a total of 5-9(usually 4-5 per group) mice tested in each control or immunization group. differences between control and immunization groups were significant. identification of new candidate T. gondii specific HLA-A*1101-restricted epitopes. d responses greater than 50 IFN- SFC from seropositive donors PBMC, but not from seronegative donors PBMC. these peptides and the proteins from which they are derived are STFWPCLLR (SAG2C13-21); SSAYVFSVK (SPA250-258) and AVVSLLRLLK (SPA89-98) adding proteins expressed in sporozoites and bradyzoites to the peptides selected. 4Splenic T cell were isolated from HLA-A*03 supertype mice 10 to 14 days after peptide immunization. predicted peptide candidates used for screening CD8+ T cells1 HLA-A*1101 ANTIGEN PEPTIDE SEQUENCES LENGTH LOCATION PREDICTED IC50 nM POOL HLA-A*1101 GRA15 STSPFATRK 9 152-160 5 P1 HLA-A*1101 GRA15 FSCDPK 9 154-162 5.3 HLA-A*1101 SAG2D PSSAQTFFYK 10 289-298 17.9 HLA-A*1101 SAG3 VVGHVTLNK 9 80-88 15.3 HLA-A*1101 SAG3 KQYWYKIEK 9 145-153 19.3 HLA-A*1101 SRS9 TTCSVLVTVK 10 357-366 20.6 P4 HLA-A* ides derived from GRA10, GRA15, SAG2C, SAG2D, SAG2X, SAG3, SRS9, BSR4, SPA, MIC1, MICA2P were screened for potential supertype epitopes. a total of 34 unique peptides IC50 50 nM (lower score, higher predicted binding affinity) of all ranked nonameric or decameric peptides were selected. HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice were immunized with peptide pools. newly identified peptides included KSFKDILPK (SAG1224-232); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6164-172); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7134-142); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C13-21); SSAYVFSVK (SPA89-98) plus PADRE and Pam2Cys in GLA-SE. mice were challenged with 10,000 Pru (Fluc)-T. gondii luciferase expressing parasites. they were immunized and in a subgroup immune function was studied. differences between control and immunized mice were significant. average population coverage by the HLA-A03 supertype is 24.51% 12.06%. the average population coverage by the HLA-A03 supertype is 24.51% 12.06%. population coverage reflects the fraction of individuals predicted to respond the epitope set inclusive of SAG1224-232 (KSFKDILPK), GRA6164-172 (AMLTAFFLR), GRA7134-142 (RSFKDLLKK), SAG2C13-21 (STFWPCLLR), SPA250-258 (SSAYVFSVK), and SPA89-98 (AVVSLLRLLK). lipopeptides with three epitope peptides linked together with alanine spacers did not stimulate an IFN- response by splenocytes from immunized mice. the lipopeptides with the three linked peptides did not work well in the transgenic mice. mice immunized with mixture of CD8+ and CD4+ eliciting peptides and lipid Pam2Cys emulsified in GLA-SE elicited higher IFN- production than mice immunized with lipopeptides. the approach using cocktails of non-covalently linked lipid mixed to helper T lymphocytes(HTL) and CD8+T cell (cytolytic T lymphcyte[CTL] and IFN- toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist is a potent activator of Th1 responses. it has been used as an adjuvant in human vaccine trials for several infectious disease and malignancy indications. e challenge measured as protection against a luciferase producing Type ll parasite using a Xenogen camera system. more detailed studies will follow up and extend these intitial studies of reduction of parasite burden seen in Figures 5 and 7. peptide-based approaches to induction of IFN- responses were evaluated as part of ongoing efforts to develop immunosense vaccines for use in humans. a human immunome-based and parasite genome based bioinformatices approach was used to define candidate HLA-A03 supertype restricted peptides. these peptides elicit interferon- production by human CD8+T cells. they also elicit interferon production by mouse splenocytes.
