{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis has been used to classify infectious bronchitis virus strains. tracheal tissue specimens from 100 different commercial broiler flocks with respiratory distress in Afghanistan were collected during 2016-2017. the genome consists of a 27 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule. the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is responsible for the induction of neutralization antibody and attachment to the cell. there are 12.16 million birds in Afghanistan that are kept for poultry production. total RNA was extracted from tissue with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and then stored at -70\u00b0C. a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay was used to amplify the conserved sequence within the 5 -untranslated region of the IBV genome described by Callison et al. (2006). phylogenetic relationships based on partial spike gene nucleotide sequences of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) detected in Afghanistan. number in branches indicates bootstrap value from 1000 replicates. horizontal distances proportional to minimum number of nucleic acid differences required to join nodes. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences determined in this study are available in the GenBank under accession number: MF322853-MF322867. this study indicates the spread of IBV including two genotypes: LX4 (GI-19) and IS-1494 (GI-23). the spread of IS-1494 was approximately 20% while it was similar to circulating strains of Iran and Iraq. it needs to be mentioned that common strains of the region, like Massachusetts and 793/B, were not detected in this study. it is suggested to sample from other areas, species and seasons in Afghanistan and sequence the isolates."}
