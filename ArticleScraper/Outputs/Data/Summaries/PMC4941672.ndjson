{"summary": "the most commonly identified viruses have been influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 1, 2 Human rhinovirus (HRV) has more recently been identified as a major viral pathogen. Luminex Diagnostics used nasopharyngeal swabs to test viral pathogens. adenovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 14, RSV A/B, enterovirus/human rhinovirus (ENT/HRV), coronavirus OC43/229E/NL63/HKU1 and metapneumovirus. ENT/HRV and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the most common viruses detected in 214 (62%) and 71 (206%) outbreaks. of the 71 outbreaks in which ENT/HRV was detected, 39 (549%) occurred in CSDs, 21 (296%) in LTCFs, and 18 (8%) in other facilities. ENT/HRV and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the most common cocirculating viruses reported in all outbreaks with multiple viruses detected. 7 of the 19 multiple virus outbreaks reported by LTCFs and 10 of the 12 multiple virus outbreaks reported by CSDs. hMPV 1 (04) 0 0 A(H1N1)pdm09/Parainfluenza 2 1 (04) 1 (21) 0 Parainfluenza 2/Parainfluenza 3 1 (04) 0 0 Parainfluenza 3/RSV B 1 (04) 0 0 ENT/HRV/A(H1N1)pdm09/influenza B 1 (04) 0 0 ENT/HRV/A(H this study provides a larger sample size and is unique in that both institutional (predominantly elderly) and community outbreak (predominantly children) settings are described. we also found an increased likelihood of detecting viruses causing outbreaks as the number of specimens tested increased. this study highlights the importance of submitting more than one sample to properly investigate an outbreak. other bacterial agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumonia could not be ruled out as the cause of outbreaks. OAHPP received a research grant from GlaxoSmithKline to study phenotypic resistance in influenza virus. longtin J, MarchandAustin A, Winter AL et al.
