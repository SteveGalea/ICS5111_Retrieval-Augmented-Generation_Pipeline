{"summary": "lncRNAs (lncRNAs) are regarded as a mystery in terms of sequence and structural conservation. the vast majority of lncRNAs seems to evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologs. CROSSalign is an algorithm trained on experimental data to predict RNA secondary structure profiles without sequence length restrictions. DTW flexibility allows managing profiles of different lengths without having to sacrifice computational time. CROSSalign is able to find structural homologs among millions of possible matches identifying structural domains with great accuracy. crystallographic data show higher correlations with CROSS profiles (Pearson's correlation of 0.91) than SHAPE profiles (Figures 1A,B, correlation of 0.50) CROSS shows better performances than algorithms such as RNAstructure (Mathews et al., 1999; Reuter and Mathews, 2010) CROSSalign and crystallographic profiles identify specific clusters of RNA molecules with low sequence identity and high structural similarity. CROSSalign performs pairwise comparisons while CMfinder does multiple alignments. CROSSalign has particularly strong performances on the largest dataset. the first step to validate CROSSalign was to search for structural similarities between the Small SubUnit (SSU) of the rRNA of different bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Deinococcus radiodurans) the shuffled sequence of Escherichia coli is used as a negative control. a coding human mRNA randomly selected from ENSEMBL with the same length of E. coli ribosome (ENSG00000002933) is used as an additional control. XIST XIST is a lncRNA characterized by several repetitive domains showing different structural properties. in mouse it consists of 7.5 copies (8.5 in humans) of 26-mers separated by U-rich linkers. RNAinverse from Vienna suite generated 50 different sequences with the same structure as RepA. the sequences were divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set. both the positive and negative sets have poor sequence similarity. our analysis reveals that primates cluster close to human (Supplementary Figure 7A), while other species are more distant (Supplementary Figure 7A, 8). XIST was ranked as the best significant match in the pool (CROSSalign distance 0.01; p-value 106) and repA was correctly identified (predicted coordinates: 328\u2013764; 95% overlap with the query region) CROSSalign used CROSSalign to search for the human RepA. we identified XIST as the 5th best hit. the correct coordinates of human RepA within mouse XIST rank second in our analysis. the distance was calculated using CROSSalign (OBE-DTW) and plotted against sequence similarity. XIST is the best match of human RepA within all mouse lncRNAs. the region D2 is highly structured and consists of 15 helices, 11 terminal loops, and 4 junctions. positive regions are to be considered double-stranded, negative regions single-stranded. the structural contents of the D domains of HOTAIR are reported on the curve. orangutan D2 was then searched for within all human lncRNAs. HOTAIR was found as the best match (0.092; p-value 104) and matching position (nucleotides: 284\u2013788; 57% overlap); Figure 6B. reported sequence position shows a sizeable overlap with the D4 domain in human HOTAIR. the distance was obtained using OBE-DTW and plotted against sequence similarity. human D4 is not identified as the best match (1849th best hit; colored in red) previous studies already reported a similarity in terms of secondary structure between HIV and SIV that is not explained by sequence similarity. previous studies indicate that HIV and Ebola have the same mechanisms of egress, taking contact with the cellular protein Tsg101. we found two clusters (brown and red; Figure 8B) that are similar in terms of structure (0.06 CROSSalign distance; p-value 106) and sequence (80\u201395% sequence similarity) other clusters (red and green) showed significant distance in structure (from 0.06 to 0.09 of CROSSalign distance; p-value 106) that is not identifiable by sequence similarity (85% sequence similarity). 0.098 (p-value = 0.19) 0 0.085 (p-value 105) 0.087 (p-value 105) 0.10 (p-value = 0.35) E. coli 0.098 (p-value = 0.19) 0.10 (p-value = 0.35) 0 0.066 (p-value 105) 0.098 (p-value = 0.19) P. aeruginosa 0.097 (p-value = 0.13) 0.10 (p-value a coding human mRNA randomly selected from ENSEMBL with the same length of E. coli ribosome (ENSG00000002933) is used as an additional control to highlight exclusive structural similarities between the different SSUs. significant p-values are reported in bold. CROSSalign used RNAinverse from Vienna suite to generate 50 different sequences with the same structure as RepA. the sequences were divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set. both positive and negative sets have poor sequence similarity. CROSSalign is able to recognize structural similarities between non-similar sequences, outperforming covariance-based approaches. results indicate that CROSSalign is able to recognize structural similarities between non-similar sequences, outperforming covariance-based approaches. baboon repA and lemur repA showed a larger distance in terms of both structural and sequence similarity. CROSSalign distances of baboon repA are computed against all human lincRNAs. the distance is calculated using OBE-DTW and plotted against sequence similarity. results reveal previously unreported relationship between XIST and Mirg. also the second best result, Rian (ENSMUSG00000097451), is expressed in embryo. no information is available on the third and fourth hits. XIST ranks as the 14th hit of human RepA in all mouse lncRNAs. results indicate double-stranded regions are more conserved than single-stranded regions. CROSS achieves an AUC > 0.80 in predicting its SHAPE profile. we used the same reverse engineering process as for RepA to generate 50 different sequences. the sequences generated by RNAinverse showed a similarity that is higher. CROSSalign reports good performances (AUC of 0.72; Figure 5C) that are better than those of the covariance-based approach CMsearch. the distance was obtained using OBE-DTW and plotted against with sequence similarity. human D2 is identified as the best match (colored in red) we divided HIV into 10 non-overlapping regions of 1,000 nucleotides. we searched each of them against a database of ssRNA viruses having as host human (292 cases, downloaded from NCBI; Supplementary Table 3) to identify structurally similar domains. the region spanning the first 1000 nt (including 5\u2032 UTR) is the most conserved among all the viruses. CROSSalign distances of the complete HIV genome against the complete genomes of 4884 HIV strains. CROSS has no sequence length restrictions and shows strong performances on both coding and non-coding RNAs. the combination with DTW allows very accurate comparison of structural profiles. CROSSalign accurately recognizes highly dissimilar sequences (35%) encoding. CROSSalign is able to identify clusters of low-sequence / high-structure similarity. aligning the structural regions only (double-stranded with positive CROSS scores) can boost CROSSalign performances. the use of unstructured regions only (single-stranded with negative CROSS scores) is prone to introduce noise. CROSSalign is a versatile algorithm able to simplify the complex search for structural similarity among RNA molecules. CROSS models have been previously trained on data from high-throughput experiments. the consensus model Global Score was tested on independent sets of NMR/X-ray structures. global score was shown to increase the PPV of RNAstructure from 0.68 to 0.72. improvements in 13 cases (from 0.44 to 0.72) and decreases the PPV in only three cases for which real SHAPE data does not improve performance. to generate pairwise structural comparisons, we used settings recommended in the dtw manual. the distance is computed with an asymmetric pattern and using the Manhattan distance. the final CROSSalign distance is normalized for the lengths of both profiles. the HIV strains were downloaded from HIV databases (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/), selecting only complete genomes for a total of 4,804 sequences processable by CROSS. RNAinverse uses reverse folding engineering to generate several sequences whose minimum free energy matches the target structure. CMsearch is a method used to search a covariance model (CM) against a sequence database and provides a ranked list of the sequences with the most significant matches relative to the CM. using the CMbuild package we built the CMs using as input the multiple alignments of the two individual reference sets (RepA and D2). input 1 will be fragmented with a non-overlapping window of 200 nucleotides. each fragment of RNA input 1 will then be searched within the other sequence. a minimum length of 600 nucleotides is recommended for fragmentation. CROSS profiles are smoothed using a function previously defined. the similarity is represented by the red path in the figure. vertical paths are to be considered gaps, while diagonal paths highlight similar regions of the two profiles. consensus model Global Score was trained and tested on independent sets of NMR/X-ray structures. in the testing phase, single and double-stranded nucleotides were recognized with an AUC of 0.72 and a PPV of 0.74. comparison with experimental SHAPE data shows similar performances. the PPV increases from 0.67 to 0.70 using Global Score. nucleotides with a score higher than 0 are predicted to be double-stranded and structured. nucleotides with a score lower than 0 are single-stranded. lncRNA sequences were downloaded from ENSEMBL 82 using Biomart. the complete viral genomes were downloaded from NCBI selecting ssRNA viruses having as host human or primates (for SIV), for a total of 292 complete genomes. structural similarity we created different sequences with the same secondary structure as RepA (XIST) and D2 (HOTAIR). RNAinverse uses reverse folding engineering to generate several sequences whose minimum free energy matches the target structure. the tool was launched using standard parameters to generate 50 sequences for each structure. the algorithm can be launched in 4 different modes, each being a specific variation of the DTW algorithm. the standard-DTW is recommended for comparing structures of RNAs with similar lengths. each fragment of RNA input 1 will then be searched for within the other sequence. the dataset mode allows the user to search for a single sequence within all the lincRNAs of a specific organism. individual alignments are available for the top 20 pairs. each case, the shorter profile is searched within the larger one following the OBE-DTW procedure. the main plot shows the CROSS profiles of the optimal matching region selected by the OBE-DTW algorithm. the fragmented OBE-DTW is a particular form of DTW optimized to search for unknown secondary structure domains of one profile within the other. the secondary structure of RNA input 1 will be fragmented. a minimum length of 600 nucleotides is recommended for fragmentation. the dataset mode allows the user to search for a single sequence within all the lincRNAs of a specific organism. each case, the shorter profile is searched within the larger one. OBE-DTW allows the identification of the optimal starting/ending points of a match. the optimal match is reported in terms of coordinates relative to the larger profile (RNA input 2). in order to keep the gaps introduced by the OBE-DTW algorithm, the two profiles are not smoothed. supplementary material The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2018.00111/full#supplementary-material."}
