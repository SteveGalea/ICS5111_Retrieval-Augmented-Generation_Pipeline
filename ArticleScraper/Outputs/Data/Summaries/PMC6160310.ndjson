{"summary": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus. it causes acute and chronic viral hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure in infected individuals. it is known to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, transfusion of infected blood products or through the vertical route. an outbreak has even been reported from australia, caused by a locally-acquired HEV. recent increase in organ transplantation and exposure to the disease has further expanded the incidence of HEV infection. the disease is generally cured in 4\u20136 weeks without the need of any medication. capped (green box) genomic (g)RNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs synthesize viral capsid (ORF2) and ORF3 proteins. gRNA and other viral and/or host factors mediate assembly of new virions. ORF4 is present only in case of genotype 1 HEV. 8 months of ribavirin treatment failed to eliminate the HEV. PEG-IFN- has been used in patients with liver transplant, kidney transplant, human immunodeficiency virus infection and leukemia who are chronically infected with HEV. antiviral effect of inhibitors of the nucleotide synthesis pathway Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase is an essential enzyme in the purine biosynthesis pathway. mycophenolic acid and ribavirin act more effectively to inhibit HEV replication than mycophenolic acid or ribavirin alone. nucleoside analogues 2\u2019-C-methylcytidine retained anti-HEV activity even after long-term exposure to the virus. however, 2\u2019-C-methylcytidine showed an antagonistic effect when tested in combination therapy with ribavirin. further in vivo evaluation should provide insights about its anti-HEV effects. treatment of cells with 2, 4 and 8 M of PPMO HP1 reduced luciferase expression by 53.4%, 94.4% and 99.7%, respectively, in a luciferase reporter based HEV replicon system. the antiviral activity of PPMO HP1 was specific, dose-responsive and potent. zinc is an essential micronutrient, which plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes. it also acts as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial against several pathogens. zinc salts did not affect virus entry into the host cell. antiviral effect of nucleoside analogues 2\u2019-C-methylcytidine is a nucleoside analogue that efficiently inhibits HEV replication in the cell culture system. but 2\u2019-C-methylcytidine retained anti-HEV activity even after long-term exposure to the virus. further in vivo evaluation of this compound should provide insights about its anti-HEV effects. PPMO HP1 specifically inhibits viral translation by targeting a highly conserved sequence in the start region of ORF1 of genotype 1 and genotype 3 HEV. treatment of cells with 2, 4 and 8 M of PPMO HP1 reduced luciferase expression by 53.4%, 94.4% and 99.7% respectively. pe et al.60 reported significant inhibition of HEV replication-related luciferase activity in cells treated with MG132. but MG132 also reduced the cellular RNA and protein levels, indicating its effect to be nonspecific. Zinc is an essential micronutrient, which plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes. virus.67,68 has also been shown to interact with the envelope protein of the Japanese encephalitis virus, facilitating its entry into the host cells. it remains to be tested whether Grp78 and ORF2 interaction mediates HEV entry. methyltransferase is responsible for capping of the viral genome. sofosbuvir acts by inhibiting the activity of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. however, subsequent studies failed to observe its potent inhibitory effect. eEF11 was identified to be the most important host factor for maintaining the integrity of the above multiprotein complex. eIF4A2 and eIF3A are also supposed to block viral replication. a thorough understanding of such interactions will help in decoding the mechanism underlying virus release. an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus release has been identified. an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus release acts by blocking the interaction between the viral gag and host tumor susceptibility gene 101-encoded proteins. uncapped HEV RNA is inefficient in replication. guanyltransferase donates a GMP moiety to the RNA, followed by cap methylation by guanine-7-methyltransferase activity. inhibition of HEV methyltransferase activity appears to be a potent antiviral strategy. the interaction between host eEF11 and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is important for optimal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. 41 host proteins were identified to be the direct interaction partners of g-1 HEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 23 could also associate with g3-HEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. IF3A are also supposed to block viral replication. helicase is a nucleoside triphosphatase with the ability to unwind RNA duplexes in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. an inhibitor against the above interaction may prove to be a potent antiviral against HEV. a detailed investigation of HEV release mechanism should identify additional targets for antiviral development. the antivirals will also prove useful for patients with acute, chronic or fulminant HEV infections. -C-methylcytidine HEV replication inhibitor Nucleoside analogue 53 PPMO HP1 HEV replication inhibitor Inhibition of viral translation 57 1-(9-ethylcarbazol-3-yl)-3-(2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)urea HEV replication inhibitor Unknown 58 Zinc HEV replication inhibitor Unknown 62 Abbreviations: HEV, hepatitis E virus; PPMO, peptide-conjugate"}
