{"summary": "RNA viruses are amongst the most versatile and complicated pathogens in terms of genetic material and evolution, modes of transmission to various hosts, and persistence in the environment. some RNA viruses exhibit broad host tropism and are known to have the highest propensity to cross species barriers. despite the high disease burden, most of the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), including India, have not invested enough in research and development on RNA viruses. this article presents the outcome of these discussions, which could act as relevant information for funding agencies, institutional leaders and policy makers in India. DENV alone causes around 60 million apparent cases every year. there is no real estimate for infections caused by other RNA viruses such as Chikungunya, influenza, respiratory and enteric RNA viruses. tropical weather conditions, poor sanitation and personal hygiene contribute to year-round outbreaks and establishment of endemicity for many RNA viruses. the burden of viral infections is either not estimated thoroughly and consistently, or is hugely underestimated in India. deNV alone is estimated to cost around $1 billion in terms of annual economic burden. emerging RNA viruses such as ZIKV, Nipah virus, Chandipura virus are also a matter of grave concern to India. the last 10\u201315 years have seen the establishment of a number of world class educational and research institutions such as the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Translational Health Science and Technology Institute and the Indian Institute of Technology. the time is apt for creating a roadmap for research on infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses in India. there are no comprehensive programs on diagnostics, surveillance, vaccine development or antivirals, which encompass target identification to proof-of-concept studies. lack of quality mentorship and insufficient critical mass is an impediment to innovation that is relevant and significant at global level. some young Indian institutes and researchers are developing research programs with translational outcomes in mind. a translational research program would require well-designed, sustainable partnerships for rational design, optimization and development of immunogens based on the knowledge of epitopes involved in viral entry, molecular interactions, and antigen presentation. robust assay platforms validated with reference reagents for diagnosis, surveillance, molecular epidemiology and immune responses. robust manufacturing partners who have low-cost manufacturing capabilities complying with GMP norm enabling translational research, in general, requires a concerted effort, sustained funding and institutional support. institutions and funding agencies need to redesign the evaluation and input mechanisms for projects which have translational outcomes as the end point. the group felt that India has unique capabilities and resources to address these challenges. mentors should be part of scientific advisory groups (SAG) and institutions need to set up an active interaction and mentoring process between the SAG members and young scientists. deeper insights into virus attachment and entry by structural biology are aiding immunogen design and vaccine development. new strategies and tools are required to address key questions in epidemiology, disease burden, and transmission dynamics at the population level. research and development on RNA viruses should be connected to capacity building in vaccine development, scale up in manufacturing and product licensing by the industry. initiatives taken up by BIRAC should be emulated by other funding agencies and the industry should reciprocate by finding appropriate academic partners. emphasis should be laid on the establishment of cohorts with sound study design and long-term follow up plans, along with state-of-the-art biobanking facility. strengths India now ranks fifth in global research publication output. majority of the research activities in India is driven by post-graduate students who join PhD programs or as research fellows supported by extra-mural funds. postgraduates from over 700 universities in India graduate with minimal research exposure and insufficient skills. the problem of inaccurate prediction of circulating strains and logistical difficulties in vaccine manufacturing is a challenge for flu vaccines. new vaccines against pathogens such as dengue or influenza viruses need to provide a broad immunity against all serotypes/reassortants. robust assay platforms validated with reference reagents for diagnosis, surveillance, molecular epidemiology and immune responses. robust manufacturing partners who have low-cost manufacturing capabilities complying with GMP norms. stable clinical trial partners who have a thorough knowledge of regulatory requirements starting from Phase I to post-licensure activities. experts at the EMBO symposium on RNA viruses debated and recognized the challenges of running sustainable translational program in India. the group felt that India has unique capabilities and resources to address these challenges and can set an example for other resource-constrained nations. RNA virus research in india would benefit by focusing on filling the knowledge gaps in areas such as epidemiology, economic burden of the disease, immune response to primary and secondary infections, biology of virus life-cycle with focus on epitopes for vaccine design. new strategies and technologies are required to address key questions in epidemiology, disease burden, and transmission dynamics at the population level. clinical trial groups need an in-depth knowledge of regulatory guidelines and rigorous training to conduct vaccine trials. clinical trial sites should have a policy of generous sharing of precious samples from cohorts, trials and human challenge studies. the Indo-US vaccine action program and BIRAC may play a critical role in supporting such endeavors. the community of scientists and concerned professionals must work together with single mindedness to prevent human suffering. we must build capacity in LMICs that are often the most vulnerable to viral infectious diseases, outbreaks and epidemics."}
