{"summary": "the HCV genome is a single, positive-stranded RNA with a nucleotide length of 9.6 kb. it encodes a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,000 amino acids. the release of C, E1, and, p7 from the polyprotein is mediated by the cellular signal peptidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum. ic 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) interacts with HCV NS3 protein. plasmid p90/HCV FL-long pU contains the full-length sequence of the HCV-H isolate. to isolate the cDNA fragment, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed. protease domain (from a.a. 1 to a.a. 208) was used to clone HCV NS3 protein helicase domain (from a.a. 199 to a.a. 508) for yeast two-hybrid screening except the oligonucleotide (5\u2032GGAATTCGCGCCACCTGCATG3\u2032 and 5\u2032CGTCTAGATTACTCGCGCGGTGAG3\u2032) was used to clone enzymes (EcoRI and XhoI) and cloned into the pACT2 expression vector (linearized with EcoRI/XhoI) the same forward primer and a different forward primer (5\u2032CCGAATTCGCGGTGAGAAGTACCGC3\u2032) were used to clone the DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 92 a.a. of cdN protein (a.a. 110-201) cDNA library used for this screening was a human fetal liver library, HL4029AH (Clontech) cell culture HuH7 cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 400 g/ml G418. itation and Western Blotting Analysis 3\u20135106 cells were seeded in a 100-mm culture dish. cells were transfected with 2 ug plasmid DNA using the ExGen 500 transfection reagent. at 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml RIPA. cell washed with methanol/acetone (11) at 0\u00b0C for 10 minutes. washed with incubation buffer (0.05% NaN3, 0.02% saponin and 1% skim milk in PBS) then incubated with the mouse anti-myc antibody (1200 dilution) cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (1200 dilution) nmol nucleoside formed per minute per milligram of protein. all assays were done in duplicates with two different amounts of protein. results derived from two different amounts of protein are almost identical. oligonucleotide primers were used to clone the DNA fragment encoding HCV NS3 protein helicase domain. after PCR, the DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI/XbaI) and inserted into the pcDNA3-myc vector for transient expression in mammalian cells. cdN plasmids were amplified by the PCR from the 3\u2032-UTR of RBaK cDNA. the fragment was digested with restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI) and cloned into the pACT2 expression vector (linearized with EcoRI/XhoI) the same forward primer and a different reverse primer were used to clone the DNA fragment. oligonucleotide primers were used to clone the DNA fragment encoding cdN protein from a.a. 66 to a.a. 109. the DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes (EcoRI and XhoI) and cloned into the pACT2 expression vector (linearized with EcoRI/XhoI) Western blotting analysis 3\u20135106 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dish. cells were lysed in 1 ml RIPA (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Trition-X 100, 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) the antibody-antigen complex was pulled down with Pansorbin (Merck, USA) the samples were treated at 100\u00b0C in the sample buffer (67.5 mM Tris-HCl, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue and 10% glycerol) in each experiment, 5% of cell lysates were used for protein expression analysis directly. d anti-V5 antibody (1200 dilution) at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. cells were washed three more times with PBS. mouse anti-NS3 monoclonal antibody and Goat anti-cdN polyclonal antibody used as primary antibodies. the virus-containing supernatant was clarified by low-speed centrifugation. the cells were separated into 3.5 cm Petri dish at the density of 2105 cells. after 4 hrs, the cells were attached and 100 l of HCVcc-containing supernatant was added to each dish. a.a. 846 to 1008 of ELKS-protein could interact with the NS3 protease domain. no non-specific interactions were observed in the negative controls. the myc-tagged full-length NS3/4A protein and the V5-tagged cdN protein were co-expressed in HuH7 cells by transient transfection. co-immunoprecipitation experiments of NS3/4A and cdN expressed in HuH7 cells. cells were transfected with empty vector (lanes 1 and 5, 4 ug of DNA) NS3/4A protein tagged with myc (lanes 4 and 8, 2 ug of myc-NS3/4A plus 2 ug of empty vector), cdN tagged with V5 (lanes 3 and 7, 2 ug of cdN the cdN protein was found to co-localize with the NS3 protein in the cytoplasm. cdN protein was also found to co-localize with the NS3 protein in the cytoplasm. onucleotidase activity assay to detect the dephosphorylation of dUMP was established following a published procedure [15] to confirm whether this assay could indeed measure cdN activity. cdN protein increased about 2 fold in these cdN protein over-expressed cells as a gain-of-function control. mdN protein was not the major contributor for 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity. protein was not the major contributor for 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity. protein was not the major contributor for 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity. at least 50% of the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in the HuH7 cells measured in this assay is derived from cdN protein. the cellular cdN activity was partially repressed by HCV NS3/4A protein in both transiently-transfected and Stably-transfected systems. HuH7 cells were mock-transfected (lane 1) or transfected with empty vector (3 ug, lane 2), the cdN plasmid (3 ug, lane 3) or different amount of myc-NS3/4A plasmids (1 ug, lane 4; 1.5 ug, lane 5; 2 ug, lane 6; 3 ug, lane 7) together with empty vectors to a total of 3 ug dN activity, HCV sub-genomic RNA replicons were reduced significantly and dose-dependently as determined by the amount of NS5A protein. the NS5A protein amount was also used to reflect the NS3 protein amount since the expression of these two proteins correlate very well in HCV replicon cells. proteins derived from these cells were analyzed using antibodies against NS5A to reflect HCV replication (upper panel), against cdN protein (middle panel) or against Erk-2 as a loading control (bottom panel). the effect of HCV on cdN activity was also determined in a HCV infectious system [16], [17], [18]. cdN protein was probably not cleaved by NS3 protein because no potentially cleaved product of cdN was detected in these cells. cdN expression was knocked-down in HCV sub-genomic replicon cells. cdN expression was knocked-down in these cells. cytosolic 5\u2032 (3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) was used as the bait for yeast two-hybrid screening. only one cDNA clone, which encoded a truncated cdN protein without its N-terminal 44 amino acids, was found to interact with the NS3 protein out of a total of 1106 transformants. a.a. 846 to 1008 of ELKS-protein could interact with NS3 protease domain. no non-specific interactions were observed in the negative controls. co-immunoprecipitation experiments of HCV NS3/4A and cdN expressed in HuH7 cells. cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western-blotting. cdN-V5 protein and the myc-NS3/4A protein were marked with two different arrows. cdN protein was found to co-localize with the NS3 protein in the cytoplasm. the cells were co-transfected with the plasmid expressing the cdN protein with a V5 tag and the plasmid expressing HCV NS3/4A protein with a myc tag. after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with mouse anti-myc and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. FITC-conjugated anti-V5 antibodies were then used for staining. cdN shRNA reduced the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity significantly. majority of 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in the HuH7 cells is from the cdN protein. cdN and mdN (mitochondrial 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase; dNT-2) catalyze the dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and regulate dTTP formation in cytosol and mitochondria respectively. at least 50% of the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in the HuH7 cells measured in this assay is plasmids encoding HCV NS3/4A protein were transiently transfected into HuH7 cells. the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in the cells was repressed by NS3/4A protein in a dose dependent manner. in this assay, the cells with over-expressed cdN protein were served as a positive control. the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity was measured using cell lysates derived from (A) cells were mock-transduced (lane 1) or transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing EGFP (lane 2) or HCV NS3/4A protein (lane 3) ribonucleotidase activity was 1.5-fold higher in 103 U/ml interferon treated replicon cells than that of non-treated cells. the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity was three fold higher in 104 U/ml-interferon treated replicon cells than that of non-treated cells. the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity was reduced significantly in cells infected with infectious HCV virions. cdN activity but not its protein amount was partially suppressed by the infection of HCV virions. cdN protein was over-expressed exogenously in the HCV subgenomic cells. cellular cdN protein was reduced to 13%\u201359% by different shRNAs targeting cdN (middle panel, Fig. 8B) however, the amount of HCV NS5A protein was not altered in these cells. cdN protein did not affect HCV replication. at least seven 5\u2032-nucleotidases with different subcellular localization have been cloned. some 5\u2032-nucleotidases are ubiquitous (eN, cN-II, cdN, and mdN) NS3 protein caused a 30% reduction of the cellular 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in cultured human cells. the apparent lowered 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity should be due to a reduction of cdN but not mdN activity. oxyribonucleotidase activity measured after 104 U/ml interferon treatment was three fold higher than that of non-treated cells. the amount of cdN protein remained almost the same in the non-treated cells. cdN activity is more pronounced in HCV replicons than in HCV infected cells due to the greater amount of NS3 protein in HCV replicon cells. NS3 protein was found to interact with cdN protein. HCV may induce diseases through inhibition of cdN activity."}
