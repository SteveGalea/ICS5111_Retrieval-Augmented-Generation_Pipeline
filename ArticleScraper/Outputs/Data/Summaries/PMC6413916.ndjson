{"summary": "peak VO2 was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. results Eight hundred and fifty-two participants (48% male) were included in the analyses. peak VO2 z scores improve the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness. peak VO2 is developmentally divergent, varying with age, maturity and sex. it has been convention to scale peak VO2 by simply dividing absolute peak VO2 (mL. min-1) by body mass (ratio scaling) this results in a different pattern of development in peak VO2 in comparison to absolute peak VO2. children aged 8\u201316 years were recruited from the community using a stratified (by districts) random selection of primary (21 schools) and secondary schools (19 schools) from the 4 main geographical regions of Hong Kong (i.e. Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories East and New Territories West) participants were excluded from the study. a total of 12 primary and 19 secondary schools were randomly chosen. all students of the selected schools were invited to participate in the study. participants were asked to abstain from alcohol, any caffeinated drink and vigorous exercise for 24 hours prior to testing. peak VO2 was calculated using the standard deviation of the 100th centile (SDc100) and the age- and sex-specific SD described by Healy [23]. we collected pilot data from 261 healthy children aged between 9\u201316 years. a log-linear regression model was constructed using log (peak VO2) as the dependent and log (body weight) as independent variables. the interaction effects of age and sex were tested and found to significantly modulate the association between body mass and peak VO2. allometric scaling was done separately for 4 different subgroups. z scores for four different subgroups were developed to allow comparisons of peak VO2 across age and sex. linear (x), second-order (x2) and third-order (x3) effects of age, height and weight were tested. subjects with the resulting standardised predicted VO2 greater than 3 or less than -3 were considered outliers and were excluded. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of the calculated z scores with body size and age. students\u2019 t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test were used for group comparisons for parametric, nonparametric, and categorical data. the study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2014New Territory East cluster clinical research ethics committee. a total of 12 primary and 19 secondary schools were randomly chosen. participants were asked to abstain from alcohol, any caffeinated drink and vigorous exercise for 24 hours prior to testing. Peak VO2 Peak VO2 was assessed using an incremental treadmill running test to maximum [21]. participants began walking on the treadmill at an age-specific walking speed for 3 minutes. speed was then increased by 1 kmh-1 every minute, until the speed reached the running pace of the participant. at this point the speed was held constant and the gradient increased by 1% every minute. the speed was then increased by 1 kmh-1 every minute until the speed reached the running pace of the participant. participants wore a comfortably fitted facemask (Hans Rudolph paediatric large size, 8950 series) and breath-by breath gas samples were collected and analysed throughout the test. peak VO2 was determined when two of the following conditions were reached: 1) a respiratory exchange ratio (RER)>1.0, 2) heart rate within 5% of age predicted maximum, 3) the participant was exhausted and refused allometric scaling was done separately for 4 different subgroups: younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males, older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) males, younger females (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) and older females (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) a l e d p e a k V O 2 = u n s c a l e d p e a k V O 2 = u n s c a l e d p e a k V O 2 = u n s c a s s s e x p o n e n t Pearson correlation analysis was used two regression models were developed for each sex and age group. one for the prediction of peak VO2 and the other for the prediction of peak VO2. z scores were evaluated for departure from a normal distribution. data from 852 (410 males, 442 females) were included in the final analysis. 68 (7%) failed to meet the criteria for a maximum effort and were excluded from the study. peak VO2 (mlkg1min-1) 43.4 8.4 8.4 37.8 6.7 0.001 Peak RER 1.12 0.08 1.09 0.09 0.001 VO2, oxygen consumption; RER, respiratory exchange ratio. a significant age*sex interaction was present (F1,834 = 102, P 0.001). 1.27 1.36 1.42 1.51 9 0.93 0.99 1.04 1.11 1.25 1.41 1.50 1.57 1.69 10 0.99 1.99 1.06 1.10 1.18 1.33 1.51 1.62 1.70 1.83 11 1.10 1.18 1.23 1.32 1.51 1.72 1.86 1.95 2.11 12 1.27 1.37 1.44 1.55 1.78 2.06 2.23 2.36 2.57 13 1.45 1.57 1.65 1.79 2.07 2.41 2.62 2.77 3.01 14 1.62 1.76 1.86 2.0 mlkg-1min-1 was expressed as a ratio standard with body mass (mlkg-1min-1), a significant main effect for age. peak VO2 was expressed as a ratio standard with body mass (mlkg-1min-1), a significant main effect for age. peak VO2 increased with age in boys (F1,408 = 43, P 0.001), but decreased with age in girls (F1,440 = 10, P = 0.002) differences between boys and girls were only significant from age 13 years and older. 6 16.9 25.3 15.2 16.4 17.0 17.6 14.1 11.4 14.2 21.2 18.8 13.1 14.9 13.7 16.1 13.0 5th 115.6 114.7 117.3 124.7 52.3 60.6 59.3 64.7 67.3 100.7 97.8 82.5 94.0 64.3 54.5 57.4 58.4 61.4 10th 121.9 122.3 125.4 129.6 57.2 64.0 61.8 70.0 68.4 103.8 101.6 89.1 101.1 allometrically scaled peak VO2 = peak VO2 = body massexponent Fig 5. Percentile curves of allometric scaled peak VO2 in age- and sex-specific subgroups. an automated excel file (S1 File) has been developed to calculate the z score for peak VO2. Pearson correlations of absolute, ratio scaled, allometric scaled peak VO2 and body mass, height, and age were close to zero (p>0.7 for all) in all subgroups. both absolute and ratio-scaled peak VO2 were significantly associated with body size and/or age in all subgroups. 0.001 -0.011 -0.011 0.085 Age -0.010 -0.012 -0.003 0.051 *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001 Absolute peak VO2 was significantly greater in older (F1,848 = 814, P 0.001) and male (F1,848 = 52, P 0.001) participants. a significant age*sex interaction was present (F1,834 = 102, P 0.001). 2.06 2.23 2.36 2.57 13 1.45 1.57 1.65 1.79 2.07 2.41 2.62 2.77 3.01 14 1.62 1.76 1.86 2.03 2.36 2.75 2.98 3.15 3.41 15 1.72 1.89 2.01 2.20 2.58 3.00 3.25 3.25 3.42 3.69 16 1.79 1.98 2.11 2.32 2.73 3.18 3.44 3.62 3.89 Age, year Standard error of centile (expressed as % of the centile) by age in girls. 1.85 1.99 2.09 2.24 13 1.13 1.24 1.32 1.44 1.69 1.96 2.12 2.23 2.40 14 1.17 1.29 1.37 1.49 1.75 2.03 2.20 2.32 2.50 15 1.21 1.32 1.40 1.53 1.79 2.09 2.26 2.39 2.59 16 1.26 1.38 1.46 1.58 1.85 2.17 2.36 2.49 2.71 Age, year Standard error of centile (expressed as % of the centile) were present. peak VO2 (mlkg-1min-1) in boys and girls of different age groups was only significant from age 13 years and older. allometric scaling The allometric exponents generated for the younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males and older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) exponents were 0.635 and 0.839 respectively. 61.4 10th 121.9 122.3 125.4 129.6 57.2 67.2 64.0 61.8 70.0 68.4 103.8 101.6 89.1 101.1 66.9 58.1 59.3 60.3 65.4 15th 133.7 124.3 128.5 131.3 60.5 68.8 76.3 74.2 104.1 104.3 99.5 105.4 69.0 61.6 62.2 62.2 62.7 68.4 25th 136.5 133.1 133.6 141.1 66.2 70.4 75.0 8 the resulting z score for peak VO2 was normally distributed and had no residual correlation with age, weight and height. the agreement between the percentile ranks from z score and allometric scaling is high. allometric scaled peak VO2 was close to zero in all subgroups. significant associations with height and age were apparent in males and in the younger females. both absolute and ratio-scaled peak VO2 were significantly associated with body size and/or age. scaled peak VO2 remained correlated with height, and age, within all age- and sex-specific groups, except older girls. z score equations for different sex and age groups were developed, which were effective in removing the influence of body mass, height and age on peak VO2. ratio-scaled peak VO2 increased from 10 to 13 years, then gradually increased. despite ratio-scaled peak VO2 remaining the most popular method of expressing peak VO2 [12, 13, 39], ratio-scaled peak VO2 was negatively correlated with body mass. identification of children with relatively low cardiopulmonary function is important. both the allometric scaling and z score approaches likely provide superior decision making with respect to the identification of children with low cardiopulmonary function. physical activity level was also not measured in this study so that its impact on peak VO2 could not be examined. the cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed on a treadmill and the reference values would not be applicable if the test was performed using other ergometers such as a cycle ergometer.
