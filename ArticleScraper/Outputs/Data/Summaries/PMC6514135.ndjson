{"summary": "BoHV-1 is an important Viral Pathogen Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). three well-defined subtypes exist, BoHV-1.1, BoHV-1.2a, and BoHV-1.2b (2b) (2). these subtypes are frequently detected in cattle suffering from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is the most economically important disease that affects beef and dairy cattle. a gram negative bacterium, Mannheimia haemolytica (MH), exists in the upper respiratory tract of healthy ruminants (19, 20) boHV-1 latency-reactivation cycle is important for Virus Transmission Acute BoHV-1 infection of cattle is initiated on mucosal surfaces. acute infection leads to high levels of virus production and secretion in ocular, oral, nasal, or genital cavities for 7\u201310 days after infection. IE gene expression is stimulated by VP16, a tegument protein (34, 35) bICP4, which transactivate viral promoters, encodes proteins that promote DNA synthesis. example of early viral proteins include the DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, small and large subunits of the ribonucleotide reductase. ORF2 has reduced virus shedding from the eye, TG, or tonsils of infected calves. LR-encoded proteins are expressed late during productive infection. but have reduced or no expression after infection with the LR mutant virus. the boHV-1 genome is GC rich and many viral promoters contain Sp1 consensus binding sites. the IEtu1 promoter that drives bICP0 and bICP4 expression is stimulated by DEX. stress-mediated activation of key viral promoters is predicted to be a very early event during reactivation from latency. boHV-1 gene expression during productive infection is operationally divided into three distinct phases. IE gene expression is stimulated by VP16, a tegument protein (34, 35) IE mRNA expression does not require de novo protein synthesis. bICP0 protein has similar properties as HSV-1 encoded ICP0 (40) the L genes are divided into two classes: Gamma-1 and Gamma-2 genes. Transcription of Gamma-1 genes requires de novo protein synthesis, including bICP0 and bICP4, but does not require viral DNA replication. the anti-apoptosis activity of ORF2 (41, 55\u201357) and the micro-RNAs regulate the latency-reactivation cycle. the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone (DEX) initiates reactivation from latency in latently infected calves 100% of the time. within 6 h after dex treatment, 11 cellular genes are induced more than 10-fold in TG. the IEtu1 promoter that drives bICP0 and bICP4 expression is stimulated by DEX. the GR and KLF15 are frequently expressed in the same TG neuron during reactivation and cooperatively stimulate productive infection. stress-mediated activation of key viral promoters is predicted to be a very early event during reactivation from latency; then viral transactivators activate all other viral genes and virus production occurs. viral infection impairs immune-recognition on several levels impairs. cell-mediated immunity (83\u201386), CD8+ T cell recognition of infected cells. red lettering denotes viral genes that counteract antiviral signaling pathways. viral promoter (99), stimulation of productive infection (41, 102) and reduces IFN- promoter activity (92\u201395) bICP0 co-localizes with and disrupts the anti-viral promyelocytic leukemia protein-containing nuclear domains (41, 101) HSV-1 encoded ICP27 regulates IFN expression (112) by interfering with activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by tank binding protein kinase 1 (TBK1) (113). bICP27 reduces bovine IFN-1 and IFN-3 promoter activity in transfected cells. infection of calves with a UL49.5 boHV-1 mutant leads to increased levels of virus neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses. VP8 is the most abundant tegument protein in the virion, enhances growth in cultured cells and is required for pathogenesis in calves (128) bICP0, encoded by the IEtu1 promoter, interferes with IFN- promoter activation. three late proteins (gG, UL49.5, and VP8) would further antagonize immune-recognition."}
