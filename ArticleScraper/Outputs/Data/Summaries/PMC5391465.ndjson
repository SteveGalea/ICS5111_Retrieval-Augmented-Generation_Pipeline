{"summary": "members of the ebolavirus species Zaire ebolavirus (only member: Ebola virus [EBOV]), Sudan ebolavirus (only member: Sudan virus), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (only member: Bundibugyo virus) were associated with outbreaks of ebolavirus disease (EVD) occurring in remote areas in central africa. more than 10,000 of EVD patients died from the disease. the GP of the virus circulating in west africa acquired an amino acid exchange, A82V, in the RBD during the course of the epidemic. we previously compared entry driven by the GP of the virus circulating in 2014 (EBOV2014) and the GP of the virus responsible for an EVD outbreak in Zaire in 1976 (EBOV1976, Mayinga strain) 1976 and EBOV2014 using reverse-genetics systems. both viruses grew with comparable efficiency in Huh-7 cells. growth of rEBOV1976 in vero E6 cells was more efficient compared to its pendant from 2014. this defect is due to reduced host cell entry. rhabdoviral vectors pseudotyped with either EBOV1976-GP or EBOV2014-GP mediated entry into two (HEK-293T and Huh-7) out of three human cell lines and all fruit bat cell lines (HypNi/1.1, RoNi/7, and EpoNi/22.1) with comparable efficiency. EBOV2014-GP mediates entry into NHP-derived cell lines, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dend SV encoding firefly luciferase was pseudotyped with VSV-G (positive control, gray), EBOV1976-GP (blue), EBOV2014-GP (red), or no glycoprotein (pCAGGS, negative control, white) at 18 h postinoculation, the transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates. GP from all preepidemic EBOV, as well as filoviruses, harbor an alanine at position 82. most EBOV associated with the west africa EVD epidemic possess a valine at position 82. EBOV2014 has evolved the valine at position 82 during the course of the epidemic. mutants EBOV1976-GP (A82V), EBOV2014-GP (V82A), EBOV1976-GP (I544T) and EBOV2014-GP (T544I) domains or subunits were exchanged in mutants EBOV1976-GP (GC+MLD_2014), EBOV2014-GP (GC+MLD_1976) and EBOV2014-GP (GP2_1976) 97.7% of the sequences stem from the three west africa countries mainly hit by the epidemic. EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP were inoculated onto different mammalian cell lines. results were normalized against transduction mediated by the respective wt GP. mutant GPs carrying alanine or valine at position 82 were incorporated into VSVpp with comparable efficiency. western blot analysis revealed that the wild-type (wt) GPs and the GP mutants with alanine or valine at position 82 were incorporated into VSVpp with comparable efficiency. a single polymorphism, T544I, in GP2 accounts for the differential ability of EBOV2014-GP and EBOV1976-GP to drive entry into nonhuman primate cells. a single polymorphism, T544I, accounts for the differential ability of EBOV2014-GP and EBOV1976-GP to drive entry into nonhuman primate cells. habdoviral pseudotypes harboring wild-type (wt) EBOV1976-GP, EBOV1976-GP (I544T), wt EBOV2014-GP, or EBOV2014-GP (T544I) were inoculated onto COS-7 cells. at 18 h postinoculation, transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates. results were normalized against trans GP chimeras between EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP were incorporated into rhabdoviral vectors with an efficiency similar to that of wild-type GP. the exchange of glycan cap jointly with the MLD did not appreciably alter entry efficiency compared to the wt GPs. s harboring no glycoprotein (pCAGGS, negative control, white), VSV-G (positive control, gray), EBOV1976-GP wt (blue), EBOV2014-GP (red), and indicated chimeras were inoculated onto different mammalian cell lines. results were normalized against transduction mediated by EBOV1976-GP wt (set as one) mutation of T544I in EBOV2014-GP significantly increased transduction of COS-7 cells. rhabdoviral pseudotypes can be recapitulated with EBOV-like particles. rhabdoviral pseudotypes can be recapitulated with EBOV-like particles. both viruses grew with comparable efficiency in Huh-7 cells. growth of rEBOV1976 in vero E6 cells was more efficient compared to its pendant from 2014. rEBOV1976 in vero E6 cells was more efficient compared to its pendant from 2014. rhabdoviral vectors pseudotyped with either EBOV1976-GP or EBOV2014-GP mediated entry into two (HEK-293T and Huh-7) out of three human cell lines and all fruit bat cell lines (HypNi/1.1, RoNi/7, and EpoNi/22.1) with comparable efficiency. EBOV2014-GP mediates entry into NHP-derived cell lines, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dend pseudotyped with VSV-G (positive control, gray), EBOV1976-GP (red), EBOV2014-GP (red), or no glycoprotein (pCAGGS, negative control, white) and inoculated onto different mammalian cell lines of human (HEK-293T, Huh-7, HOS), rhesus macaque (LLC-MK2, sMAGI), African green monkey (Vero, Vero E6, COS-7) or aire (now Democratic Republic of Congo; EBOV1976-GP) by a total of 20 amino acid residues (19) of particular interest is a single amino acid difference at position 82 within the RBD. most EBOV associated with the west africa EVD epidemic possess a valine at position 82. domains or subunits were exchanged in mutants EBOV1976-GP (GC+MLD_2014), EBOV2014-GP (GC+MLD_1976), EBOV1976-GP (GP2_2014), and EBOV2014-GP (GP2_1976) the GP was detected using an EBOV-GP-specific rabbit antiserum and peroxidase-coupled, rabbit-specific secondary antibodies. 97.7% of the sequences stem from the three west africa countries mainly hit by the epidemic. EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP were inoculated onto different mammalian cell lines. western blot analysis revealed that mutant GPs with alanine or valine at position 82 were incorporated into VSVpp with comparable efficiency. we observed a modest but not statistically significant increase in transduction efficiency by EBOV1976-GP for several cell lines. a single polymorphism, T544I, in GP2 accounts for the differential ability of EBOV2014-GP and EBOV1976-GP to drive entry into nonhuman primate cells. of a total of 20 amino acid differences between EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP, 18 reside within the GP1 subunit. the remaining two polymorphisms are located in the GP2 subunit. EBOV1976-GP, EBOV1976-GP (I544T), wt EBOV2014-GP, or EBOV2014-GP (T544I) were inoculated onto COS-7 cells. at 18 h postinoculation, transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates. results were normalized against transduction mediated by EBOV1976-GP wt (set the reduced EBOV2014-GP-mediated entry into NHP and certain human target cells is due to amino acid exchanges located in the GP2 subunit. rhabdoviral pseudotypes harboring no glycoprotein (pCAGGS, negative control). a paired, two-tailed Student t test was used to assess statistical significance. polymorphism I544T located in the internal fusion loop is responsible for the compromised EBOV2014-GP-driven entry into nonhuman primate cells. mutation of T544I in EBOV2014-GP significantly increased transduction of COS-7 cells. rhabdoviral pseudotypes can be recapitulated with EBOV-like particles. substitution I544T reduced entry driven by EBOV1976-GP. reverse exchange increased EBOV2014-GP-driven entry. our results show that EBOV2014-GP mediated entry into diverse NHP-derived cell lines with reduced efficiency compared to EBOV1976-GP. however, preliminary data indicated that EBOV2014-GP could use human and NHP-derived NPC1 with similar efficiency for cell entry. however, preliminary data indicated that EBOV2014-GP could use human and NHP-derived NPC1 with similar efficiency for entry into NPC1-transfected cells. polymorphism A82V within EBOV2014-GP was not found in any previously characterized EBOV-GP. the reverse exchange increased cell entry driven by EBOV1976-GP. a previous study showed that A82V was under positive selection during the west African EVD epidemic. chimeric GPs suggested differences in GP2 accounted for the differential ability of EBOV2014-GP and EBOV1976-GP to enter NHP cells. position 544 resides within the internal fusion loop and was previously reported to be essential for efficient membrane fusion and entry (12). the internal fusion loop present in EBOV2014-GP is less well able to support fusion with NHP cell membranes compared to its counterpart from EBOV1976-GP. a virus/H.sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 [Makona-C05_tc]; KJ660348.2) harbored threonine at position 544, while the passaged virus contained an isoleucine. EBOV harboring I544 is present in patients at very low frequency and becomes dominant upon viral propagation in cell culture. the fruit bat cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for passaging and seeding. all cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for passaging and seeding. chimeric GPs with swapped GP1/GP2 subunits were used. glycan cap (GC) and mucin-like domain (MLD) were interchanged. rEBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP mutants were generated. rEBOV2014 in 1976 and rEBOV2014 in Huh-7 and vero E6 cells, cells were infected at a multiplicity of 0.01. after 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, the inoculum was removed. samples of the supernatant were collected at days 1, 2, 3, and 7 for vero E6 cells. chimeric and mutant GPs were incorporated into VSVpp with similar efficiency as wt EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP. all samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit serum (1:5,000) and a per. a separate membrane was first incubated with antibodies against VSV-M (matrix protein) and VSV-G (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700 [American Type Culture Collection]; 1:200) all antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk. after blocking membranes were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20. luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) was transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate. the lysates were then transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate. fLuc activity was measured in a microplate reader, Plate Chameleon (Hidex) HEK-293T cells grown in T-75 cell culture flasks were transfected with 1 g of EBOV-NP, 1 g of EBOV-VP35, 8.3 g of EBOV-L, 2 g of EBOV-VP40, 12.5 g of EBOV-VP30-Luc, and 2 g of either EBOV1976-GP wt, EBOV2014-GP wt, EBOV2014-GP only complete GP sequences were included in the analysis. EBOV-GP sequences denoted \u201cpreepidemic\u201d include those that are not linked to the west African EVD epidemic. the fruit bat cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for passaging and seeding. cells were detached by either resuspension in fresh culture medium (HEK-293T cells) or by the use of trypsin/EDTA (PAN-Biotech) rEBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP mutants were generated. mutants harbored single amino acid exchanges at polymorphic sites within the RBD (EBOV1976-GP [A82V] and EBOV2014-GP [V82A] or internal fusion loop (IFL; EBOV1976-GP [I544T] and EBOV2014-GP [T544I]) monocyte-derived human macrophages (Ms) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were differentiated for 5 days in serum-free DC medium (CellGenix) in the presence of 80 U/ml GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; CellGenix), 100 ng/ml M-CSF (macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; Miltenyi Bio chimeric and mutant GPs were incorporated into VSVpp with similar efficiency as wt EBOV1976-GP and EBOV2014-GP. all samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit serum (1:5,000) and a peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dianova; 1:5,000) all antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk. membranes were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. signals of bound secondary antibodies were detected using a commercially available ECL kit (GE Healthcare) transduction of monocyte-derived human macrophages and dendritic cells with rhabdoviral pseudotypes and quantification of fLuc activity. cells were cultured and differentiated in 48-well plates for 5 days before transduction experiments were performed. cell lysates were transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate. the cells were clarified from debris by centrifugation (4,000 g, 10 min) and concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 30,000 kDa (Sartorius) concentrations were adjusted to a final volume of 500 l by addition of DMEM and inoculated onto confluent monolayers of COS-7 cells grown in 96-well plates. if not mentioned in the NCBI database, detailed information was retrieved from publications linked to the respective sequence."}
