{"summary": "Background Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Previously healthy children less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis were recruited from the Texas Children's emergency room. bronchiolitis is primarily a viral illness, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) followed by rhinovirus (RV) as the most common viral etiologies. the clinical spectrum of disease varies from mild illness not requiring hospitalization to severe respiratory failure necessitating ventilatory support in the intensive care unit. a prospective single-site cohort study of bronchiolitis extends our original observations. we hypothesize that a major source of the lactate dehydrogenase in the nasal washes of children with bronchiolitis is likely derived from epithelial cells and/or neutrophils. patients excluded were greater than 24 months of age, had significant co-morbid medical conditions, were preterm (36 weeks), or had respiratory distress unrelated to a viral URI. a physical exam was performed, demographic and medical history recorded, and nasopharyngeal secretion aspirate (NPA) obtained for viral diagnostics and biomarkers of interest. specimens were divided into six aliquots of 05\u20131 cc and snap-frozen in an alcohol-dry ice bath and stored at 80\u00b0C. only five NPA samples from the enrolled children showed inadequate sIgA levels. the remaining were either optimal (n = 84) or reasonable (n = 45) quality specimens. a standard curve was constructed demonstrating an ample linear dynamic range (r = 0996) at the dilutions tested (20 000\u201332 U/l) ages of participants were categorized into four groups: 0\u20133, 4\u20136, 7\u201311, and 12\u201323 months. duration of illness prior to presentation was classified into three groups: 0\u20132, 3\u20135 and >5 days. Virus infection patterns were single viral infection, co- viral infection. study was a cross-sectional single-site study evaluating healthy children less than 24 months of age presenting to the emergency department or the pediatric intensive care unit. subjects were recruited from two separate and simultaneously occurring investigations (by both primary authors, RM and MS) children were enrolled at the time they came to medical attention and sampled within 24 hours of admission. NPAs were collected by instilling 2 cc of normal saline into the external nares. then aspirating the material into a 5-cc syringe containing an additional 2 cc of normal saline via a flexible catheter. samples were stabilized with viral transport media (Iscove media with 15% glycerol) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AD), influenza viruses (B, H3N2, and novel H1N1), enterovirus, and coronaviruses (229 E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1). only two of the samples were of poor quality for rt-PCR; the remaining were either optimal (n = 84) or reasonable (n = 45) quality specimens. a standard curve was used to calculate relative units (U/l) of caspase activity. the value was expressed as relative units and it was assumed that one unit of caspase activity was equal to 01 ng of protein. ages of participants were categorized into four groups. log10-transformed values for NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 activity were used for statistical analysis. multiple linear regression models were developed with two-way interaction effects while controlling for age, gender, race, duration of illness, exposure to cigarette smoke, disposition of patients, virus infection pattern. children presenting on days 3\u20135 of illness were significantly likelier to be admitted to the ACU or ICU (P = 003) children presenting on days 3\u20135 of illness were significantly likelier to be admitted to the ACU or ICU (P = 003) a single infection was found in 81 (618%) of children. 39 (298%) were co-infected with more than one virus. the most commonly detected viruses were RSV(n = 84; 641%) and RV (n = 34; 260%). single 81 (618) 41 (641) 22 (550) 18 (667) 077 Co-infection 39 (298) 19 (297) 13 (325) 7 (259) No virus detected 11 (84) 4 (62) 5 (125) 2 (74) Biomarkers NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio were normalized by log10 transformation and analyzed in terms of disposition. there was a strong correlation (r = 077, P 00001) between NW-LDH and NW-caspase 3/7 activity compared to Different Viruses. Interestingly, NW-caspase 3/7 activity differences among the disposition groups were not significant (P = 04) multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted using disposition of the patients (home, ACU, and ICU) as the primary outcome to identify demographic and biomarker variables that contributed to disposition. the analysis demonstrated that children younger than 3 months were more likely to be admitted to the ACU (OR: 387, 95% CI: 111\u20131350) compared with children older than 12 months. the results indicate male children had higher NW-LDH compared with females. higher NW-LDH and NW-LDH/caspase 3/7 ratio was significantly associated with ACU admission. 0424 (0188)* 0402 (0186)* ICU 0129 (0167) 0040 (0224) 0069 (0221) Home + OBS Reference Reference Duration of Illness 3 days 0132 (0087) 0079 (0117) 0063 (0116) 3\u20135 days 0036 (0067) 0025 (0090) 0021 (0090) >5 days Reference Reference Reference Exposure to cigarette smoke Yes 0196 (0085)* 0166 (0115) 7\u201312 m and ICU 0042 (0213) 0199 (0283) 0214 (0282) Exposure to cigarette smoke*Disposition Yes and single 0735 (0216)** 1143 (0282)** 1133 (0282)** Yes and co-infection 0697 (0228)** 0971 (0303)** 0949 (0302)** Model's R-square 0732 0722 0320 Log10-transformed values were used in the analyses for NW-LDH and NW-LDH study population In the 2010\u201311 respiratory viral season, we enrolled 131 children 2 years of age with bronchiolitis. the average age (mean SD) of children was 72 58 months. most children (519%) were Hispanic, followed by african-American (242%) and white (222%). 3 months 40 (305) 14 (218) 19 (475) 7 (259) 018 4\u20136 months 31 (237) 17 (266) 6 (150) 8 (296) 7\u201312 months 30 (229) 16 (250) 7 (175) 7 (259) >12 months 30 (229) 17 (266) 8 (200) 5 (186) Gender Males 77 (588) 38 (594) 23 (575) 16 (593) 098 Race Hispanic 68 (519) 34 (531) 22 13,15 Of 131 patients, a single infection was found in 81 (618%) 39 (298%) were co-infected with more than one virus. the most commonly detected viruses were RSV(n = 84; 641%) and RV (n = 34; 260%). 5 (125) 2 (74) Biomarkers NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 were normalized by log10 transformation and analyzed in terms of disposition. children admitted to an ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH (log10 mU/l; mean SD, 556 058) than children sent home (mean SD 523 049) or admitted to the ACU (mean SD 539 050). NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 activity differences were not significant (P = 04) however, NW-caspase 3/7 activity varied significantly by virus type (RSV only, RV only, RSV + RV or others, P = 0004) compared with those co-infected with both RSV and RV (421 054), RV only (417 052) or other types of viruses (391 088) children presenting on days 3\u20135 of symptoms were significantly more likely to be admitted to either the ACU (OR: 407, 95% CI: 134\u20131236) or ICU (OR 369, 95% CI: 114\u20131190); a one-unit increase in NW-LDH (log10, mU/l) was associated with an increased likelihood of admission to either the ACU (OR: 668, 95% CI: 153\u20132929) or ICU (OR LDH was significantly lower, and NW-caspase 3/7 significantly higher, in children with an identifiable pathogen. NW-LDH was highly associated with NW-caspase 3/7 in children with an identifiable pathogen. 0025 (0090) 0021 (0090) >5 days Reference Reference Reference Exposure to cigarette smoke Yes 0196 (0085)* 0166 (0115) 0148 (0113) No Reference Reference Virus infection pattern Single 0445 (0175)* 0917 (0224)** 0936 (0223)** Co-infection 0458 (0181)* 0865 (0234)** 0877 (0234)** No virus detected Reference Reference Reference Log10 (NW-LDH \u2013 1068 (00 hispanic*Virus infection pattern Yes and single 0735 (0216)** 1143 (0282)** 1133 (0282)** Yes and co-infection 0697 (0228)** 0971 (0303)** 0949 (0302)** Model's R-square 0732 0722 0320 Log10-transformed values were used in the analyses for NW-LDH (log10 mU/l), NW-Caspase 3/7 (log10 U/l), and NW-LDH/N children admitted to an ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children who were sent home or admitted to the ACU. a higher proportion of this cohort required ICU care, (206% versus 61%) compared with 252% in Laham et al. study. some studies have shown that incubating RSV with granulocytes inhibits apoptosis in vivo. other studies have highlighted that epithelial cell apoptosis is rare in early disease,22 but predominates in later phases of illness. children 4\u201312 months of age who were hospitalized to the ACU actually had a lower NW-LDH than those sent home whose ages were greater than 12 months. however, a single variable alone may not be sufficient to explain what drives the changes of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio. in-vitro studies show that virally infected human lung epithelial cells release both LDH and caspases. this may have impacted on NW-LDH activity with higher concentrations detected later into the acute phase of the illness. the ratio of NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 reflects the innate immune balance between necrosis and apoptosis in controlling disease severity in children presenting with bronchiolitis. biomarkers that can help elucidate the pathogenesis of virally induced airway disease will likely serve as good predictive biomarkers."}
