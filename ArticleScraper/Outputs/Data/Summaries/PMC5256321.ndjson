{"summary": "hemiplegic stroke patients were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=14) or control group (n=14) the experimental and control groups performed balance training by using the newly developed Spine Balance 3D system and the well-known Biodex Balance System 30 minutes per day, three times a week for 7 weeks. results The 10mWT improved significantly (p=0.001) in the experimental group. previous studies have reported on the relationship between gait ability, speed, and independence of performing daily activities from multiple angles. physicians use various treatment methods and exercises, including trampoline training [2], visual feedback training [3], and sling exercise therapy for trunk muscles [4,5,6]. however, few studies exist on the actual effectiveness of this equipment. the subjects were randomly divided into two groups to create experimental and control groups. the random distribution of subjects into the experimental and control groups is based on a random allocation table in the order of registration of the subjects. the process of patient recruitment took a total of 4 months. the patient trains to reciprocal movement for eight directions with fixed lower extremities (A). the control group underwent training by using the training mode in the Biodex Balance System. the patients underwent posture maintenance training and center of gravity transferring postural training in eight directions. the lateral FRT measures the differences in the location of the metacarpophalangeal joints after abduction of the arm on the desired side from a natural upright position and from a laterally tilted trunk position. if the strength of the affected arm was not sufficiently strong, we measured the acromion locations instead. analyses using SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and compared pre-treatment evaluations with post-treatment evaluations. subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 15 to create experimental and control groups to be respectively treated using Spine Balance 3D (CyberMedic) and Biodex Balance System. the patients performed 30-minute exercises, three times a week for 7 weeks. exercises in eight directions are possible in 3D space. the system can be tilted up to 60\u00b0 in each direction. the forward FRT was performed by measuring the difference between the locations of the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint of the unaffected side from a normal standing position. a 100 cm-long ruler was set horizontally at the acromion level to measure the difference. the patients placed both clavicles perpendicular to the long ruler lines on the wall to avoid error caused by the decrease in ipsilateral muscle strength. the difference between the blind and the open mode is defined as the ability to display the actual balance status on the screen by using the sensors attached to the back of the patient. the monitor displayed the actual balance status in the open mode whereas the screen turned black in the blind mode to restrict compensation. the forward FRT was performed by measuring the difference between the locations of the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint of the unaffected side from a normal standing position. a 100 cm-long ruler was set horizontally at the acromion level to measure the difference. the patients placed both clavicles perpendicular to the long ruler lines on the wall to avoid error caused by the decrease in ipsilateral muscle strength. we increased the tilt in each of the eight directions to 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 by 2\u00b0/s and stopped for 5 seconds at the maximum tilt (15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0) the subjects maintained a certain trunk position, depending on the tilt. a score close to 100% reflects a good trunk muscle strength. the results for the 10mWT showed only significant improvements in the experimental group (11.383.0 to 10.122.47 seconds; p=0.01). the control group did not show significant improvements during the experiment. a patient from the experimental group failed due to aggravation of gout in the ankle joint. a follow-up loss in the control group occurred due to a MERS coronavirus outbreak. the demographics in the two groups did not show significant differences. the control group showed significant improvements at the 15\u00b0 open mode. the experimental group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test. the control group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test. trunk-activating exercises are important because weakening of the trunk is relevant to functional performance in stroke patients. improvements in trunk regulation increase dynamic balance, gait speed, and symmetrical movement of the trunk during gait in stroke patients. a recent study confirmed changes in the trunk muscle strength and body composition among elderly subjects after training using the Spine Balance 3D system. the experimental group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test with eyes open and closed under two conditions. the control group showed significant improvements in postural stability test under a condition with closed eyes condition. both the Biodex Balance System and the Spine Balance 3D system increase core muscle strength. the dynamic balance improves as shown in the BBS, TUG, FRT, and KFES-I. the 10mWT shows a relatively higher improvement compared to the Biodex Balance system. the Spine Balance 3D System induces the activation of trunk muscles and comprises an effective treatment to improve the balance and gait in patients with hemiplegia."}
