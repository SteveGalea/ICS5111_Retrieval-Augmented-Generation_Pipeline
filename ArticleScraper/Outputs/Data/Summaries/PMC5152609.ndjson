{"summary": "neonatal sepsis is divided into early-onset sepsis ( 3 days of birth) and late-onset sepsis (after 3 days) neonatal sepsis occurs in one to four cases per 1000 live births in the developed countries. G6PD catalyzes first reaction of pentose phosphate pathway that converts glucose to pentose carbohydrates. reduced glutathione plays a major role in detoxification and neutralization of oxidants. reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH-oxidase enzyme use oxygen. the inclusion criteria included clinical signs such as reduced activity, lethargy, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, apnea, cyanosis, respiratory distress, irritability, hypothermia, hyperthermia, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal distension and poor breastfeeding. 1124 healthy neonates without any medical problems were considered as the control group. the presence and absence of fluorescence was considered an active and deficient G6PD enzyme respectively. 76 neonates with sepsis and 1124 normal neonates without any medical problems were included as the control group. blood culture broths with no bacterial growth after 7 days were sub-cultured and if no growth occurred, were reported as a negative. bacteria were identified by colony morphology, gram staining and standard biochemical tests. coagulase-negative Staphylococci were not isolated for more than once or separated from the mixture of bacteria, were considered a contamination and excluded from the results. there was a statistically significant correlation between the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and sepsis in the neonates. the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in male neonates was significantly more than in the female neonates of same group. this is explained by the x-linked recessive inheritance of G6PD deficiency. this pattern of inheritance mostly affects males compared to controls. PD deficiency is associated with decrease in production of ROS in neutrophils. other possible mechanisms could explain increased prevalence of sepsis among g6PD-deficient neonates was increased serum iron concentration due to lysis of erythrocytes. lococcus aureus compared to normal infected epithelial cells have an accumulation of more oxidants and a higher apoptosis rate during infection [21]. this may be due to the decrease in NADPH production as a result of G6PD deficiency, which prevents the effective neutralization of oxidants."}
