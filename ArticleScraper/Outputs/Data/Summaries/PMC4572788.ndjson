{"summary": "angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE, ACE2) have been found throughout the human intestine. the two types of angiotensin receptors (AT1R, AT2R) have also been detected in rat and human intestine. ACE aminopeptidases are not only food metabolizing enzymes but also have regulatory functions. ACE sheddase enzymes can be cleaved and released to the circulation by one or more so called ACE sheddase enzymes[15-17] one of those enzymes is a metalloprotease ADAM9[18]. ACE shedding has been reported in lung during ischemia/reperfusion and in pulmonary endothelial cells in septic conditions. eight weeks old untreated balb/c male mice were used in ex vivo stimulation experiments. small and large intestines were excised, opened longitudinally and rinsed with Phosphate Buffered Saline. pieces of jejunum and distal colon were cut out, rinsed in Krebs buffer. immunochemical assays Corticosterone was measured from ex vivo -incubates and tissue lysates using a corticosterone EIA kit. ACE protein was measured from ex vivo -incubates and tissue lysates using ELISA (R&D System, Minnesota, MO, United States) three or five percent (w/v) DSS was introduced in the drinking water for 7 d to induce acute colitis (n = 12 in each group) the animals were weighed daily and the weight was calculated in relation to that at the beginning of the experiment. eight weeks old untreated male mice were used in ex vivo stimulation experiments. s of the buffer were taken after 90 min of incubation and centrifuged at 13000 g. the supernatants were taken for corticosterone assay and tissue pieces saved for total protein measurement. the weight of the animals, given as percent of the mean initial weight (100%) was similar in all groups from day 1 to day 5. after 7 d, the animals in 5% DSS group weighed less than controls or those in 3% DSS group. corticosterone production increased in 3% DSS group compared to control group at 90 min (2.9 1.0 ng/mL vs 2.0 0.8 ng/mL, P = 0.034) corticosterone levels did not differ significantly from control in 5% DSS-treated mice\u2019s small intestines. ACE shedding ACE protein was present in the supernatants of mouse ex vivo intestinal incubations. ACE concentration was increased in 3% DSS group small intestine supernatants at 90 min compared to control. angiotensin II, captopril and metyrapone increased corticosterone production in small intestines at 10 mol/L concentration (0.97 0.04 ng/mg protein vs 0.40 0.02 ng/mg protein, P = 0.036) captopril, an inhibitor of ACE, unexpectedly increased corticosterone production at the smallest concentration tested. animals treated with 3% DSS weighed less compared to controls after 7 d. weight loss was accompanied by diarrhea, with blood visible in the 5% DSS group. histological changes were similar in both colitis groups. in large intestine, DSS treatment stimulated corticosterone production in both 3% DSS and 5% DSS groups. corticosterone concentration in the incubates of 5% DSS-group\u2019s large intestine samples was higher than in those of 3% DSS group. in large intestine incubates, ACE concentrations were increased in 5% DSS group compared to control (41.5 23.8 ng/mL vs 20.9 13.7 ng/mL, P = 0.034) in tissue lysates, ACE protein concentrations were similar in all groups. corticosterone and ACE concentrations correlated with each other in both small intestine and large intestine. captopril, an inhibitor of ACE, unexpectedly increased corticosterone production at the smallest concentration tested, 1 mol/L (0.95 0.41 ng/mg protein vs 0.40 0.02 ng/mg protein, P = 0.040), but had no effect at higher concentrations. DISCUSSION Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) manifest by diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and inflammation. glucocorticoids and renin-angiotensin system interact in the adrenal cortex. ACE shedding from vascular endothelium has been demonstrated earlier by others. ACE activity has been measured from feces and considered as a sign of cell damage. pril treatment in vivo did not affect corticosterone production in inflamed intestine. the in vivo glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone increased it at low concentration. the present study shows that the DSS colitis model can be used to study local angiotensin system in intestinal inflammation. overexpression of renin-angiotensin system in vasculature is regarded pro-inflammatory. but we decided to clarify in the mouse dextran sodium sulfate model, whether these two systems are associated in intestinal inflammation. the authors believe that the results will have some priority in this field. peer-review Salmenkari et al address the role of corticosterone production and ACE function in modulating intestinal inflammation. they show that corticosterone and ACE are produced in this model, which could be of interest in vivo. the present findings are in agreement with the present clinical practice of use of local glucocorticoids in irritable bowel syndrome. over-activity of RAS would suggest treatment options for IBS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers."}
