{"summary": "mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS in combination with d-GalN. mortality became apparent at 5\u20136 h, and all mice died by 10 h. d-GalN/LPS administration caused no apparent liver injury in mice. per1 protects mice from d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury and prolongs survival. WT and Per1/ mice were administered 5 g/kg body weight LPS intraperitoneally. survival was monitored for 24 h (n=15 for each group) IL-1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in Per1/ mice than in WT mice. per1 deficiency increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver. administration of d-GalN/LPS significantly increased the number of KCs in both genotypes. a marked increase was observed in the number of KCs in the livers of Per1/ and WT mice compared with the livers of WT mice. hepatic mRNA levels of F4/80 (a) and CD68 (b) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. n=5; *P0.05, d-GalN/LPS group versus control group; #P0.05, Per1/ group versus WT group Per1 had no influence on the proliferation or apoptosis of macrophages. per1 deficiency increases hepatic Ccr2 expression and enhances hepatic macrophage migration. increased number of KCs could also be due to enhanced monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the liver. Flow cytometry analysis of surface CD115 and CD11b was used to determine the relative numbers of monocytes in peripheral blood. Ccr2 expression was measured in the livers (b) and peritoneal macrophages (c) significantly rescued d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1/ mice. reduced levels of serum ALT and AST in WT and DKO mice compared with those in Per1/ mice. deletion of Ccr2 rescued the abnormal accumulation of KCs in Per1/ mice. a) and AST (b) were measured at 5 h after d-GalN/LPS challenge. Experiments were repeated independently at least three times. in each independent repeat, n=5. real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that Per1 had no significant effect on PPAR- expression in macrophages. mRNA levels of PPAR-1 and PPAR-2 in peritoneal macrophages were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. PER1 and PPAR-2 bind specifically to only the \u2013180/+16-bp region of Ccr2 promoter. a ChIP mapping experiment indicated that both PER1 and PPAR- bind specifically to only the \u2013180/+16-bp region of Ccr2 promoter. r2 promoter was detected by a ChIP assay in peritoneal macrophages. vectors expressing HA-tagged PER1 and PPAR-2 were transfected. immunoblots showed recovery of PPAR-2 from B6F10 cells after immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. per1/ mice were treated with 3 g/kg LPS and 200 mg/kg d-GalN. the same dose of d-GalN/LPS induced significant liver injury. d-GalN/LPS induced significant liver injury. serum activities of ALT and AST were measured 5 h after d-GalN/LPS challenge. experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results. per1 deficiency increases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver. the expression of cytokines in macrophages was measured by real-time RT-PCR at 3 h after stimulation. d-GalN/LPS significantly increased the number of KCs in both genotypes. the data showed a significant increase in total F4/80+ cells in untreated and treated Per1/ mice. the relative number of these cells also increased in Per1/ mice. increased number of macrophages in per1-deficient livers. annexin V/PI assay was performed on macrophages harvested at 2, 4, 7 and 12 days of culture. per1 deficiency increases hepatic Ccr2 expression. increased number of KCs could also be due to enhanced monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the liver. hepatic levels of Ccr2 were also significantly elevated in Per1/ mice. per1 deficiency increased the gene expression of Ccr2 in peritoneal macrophages. a cell chemotaxis assay was performed on peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1/ mice. n=5 Deletion of Ccr2 rescued d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1/ mice. deletion of Ccr2 significantly rescued d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1/ mice. a relative decrease in the number of F4/80+ CD11b+ cells was also observed in DKO mice compared with Per1/ mice. the proportion of both hepatic nonparenchymal subsets in DKO mice are similar to those in WT mice. these results indicated that deletion of Ccr2 rescues d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1/ mice. Flow cytometry analysis of surface F4/80 and CD11b was used to determine the relative number of macrophages in the livers of mice. n=5; *P0.05, significant differences between control group and D-GalN/LPS group; #P0.05, significant differences between genotypes Per1 mediates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR- pathway. mRNA levels of PPAR-1 and PPAR-2 in peritoneal macrophages (c) and RAW264.7 cells transfected with vector alone or Per1 cDNA (d) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. n=5; in c, *P0.05, Per1/ group versus WT; in d, *P0.05, Per1 cDNA group versus control group. amino acids 1\u2013280 of PPAR-2 interact strongly with PER1. a further deletion of 97 amino acids abolished the ability of PPAR-2 to bind to PER1. residues 183\u2013505 which also contain amino acids 183\u2013280, could not bind to PER1. published studies have clearly shown that leukocyte recruitment promotes LPS-induced lethality. results revealed that Per1 prevents widespread overactivation of the innate immune system by reducing excessive hepatic macrophage recruitment. loss of per1-deficient monocytes/macrophages could not directly contribute to the increased number of KCs in Per1/ mice. this suggests the higher hepatic levels of cytokines in Per1/ mice may be due to the increased number of cells responding to LPS in the liver. this observation also well explained the elevation of hepatic cytokine expression in Per1/ mice without d-GalN/LPS treatment. chemokine receptor Ccr2 regulates monocyte entry into inflamed tissue. chemotaxis activity was enhanced in Per1-deficient macrophages. increased number of KCs in intact Per1/ mice is due to elevation of Ccr2 expression. the effect of Per1 on Ccr2 expression was reversed by the synthetic PPAR- antagonist GW9662, which strongly supports our hypothesis. the effect of Per1 on Ccr2 expression was reversed by the synthetic PPAR- antagonist GW9662, which strongly supports our hypothesis. PER1 may bind to PPAR- and stabilize the association between PPAR- and the transcription factor on the Ccr2 promoter. the addition of troglitazone or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins. PPAR- uses part of its DNA-binding and hinge domains (183\u2013280), but not its ligand-binding domain (310\u2013505), to bind PER1. the increased number of KCs caused elevation of cytokine production in d-GalN/LPS-induced liver failure. thus, the circadian gene Per1 could protect the liver from inflammatory damage by minimizing the KC-mediated immune response. serum aminotransferase activity and ELISA Serum AST and ALT activities were measured using an AU2700 automatic biochemical analyzer. serum TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. antibody For immunohistochemical staining, purified antibodies were obtained from eBioscience and eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) cell culture and treatment Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice by peritoneal lavage 4 days after injection of 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate as described previously.
