{"summary": "central nervous system harbors fully differentiated, nonregenerating postmitotic cells. astrocytes and microglia are vital participants in early innate responses to virus penetrating the CNS through neuronal transport or a breached barrier system. rapid innate response controls virus dissemination directly by IFN/, but also indirectly by promoting leukocyte infiltration and effector function. the positive feedback loop is essential to establish an antiviral state (25,39). IFN/ shapes the transition from innate to adaptive immune response by activating dendritic cells (DCs) and enhancing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (Ag) processing and presentation to promote T cell activation. almost the entire gene expression program induced by a non cytolytic virus in the CNS was either directly or indirectly linked to IFN/ signaling (27). microglia in OT-I IFNAR/ mice did not show a dynamic cellular response to LCMV infection and vascular patrolling by CX3CR1-GFP+/ myeloid cells remained similar to uninfected mice. an integral component of the acute innate immune response is production of IFN/ and signaling through the IFN/ receptor (IFNAR) autocrine and paracrine binding of IFN/ to IFNAR induces transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) global antiviral program was demonstrated using a model of CNS infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a noncytopathic arenavirus (27). intracranial infection by LCMV causes a fatal meningitis due to effector functions of infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and myeloid cells. it establishes asymptomatic long-term persistence in mice with a highly restricted CD8 T cell repertoire specific for ovalbu plasmacytoid DCs, potent peripheral IFN/ inducers, are absent from the brain parenchyma. resident CNS cells rely on intrinsic induction of IFN/ (4,38) they differ widely in both the repertoire and magnitude of basal and inducible transcripts encoding PRRs and factors associated with the IFN/ pathway. neurotropic viruses predominantly infect neurons, but also target glia cells. astrocytes and microglia/macrophages are the main source of IFN. astrocytes and microglia/macrophages are the main source of IFN. MHV belongs to the family of enveloped stranded RNA coronaviruses. prevalent strains used to study acute and persistent CNS infection are the dual hepato- and neurotropic MHV-A59 strain and the JHM 2.2v-1 monoclonal antibody-derived neutralization escape variant. both are sublethal in adult mice and cause immune-mediated demyelination (1\u20133) astrocytes expressed lower basal levels of IFN/-associated genes relative to microglia. astrocytes are poor initial sensors of MHV-A59 to induce IFN/, but effective IFN/ responders. primary mouse astrocytes trigger IFN synthesis to TMEV infection (37) ines, IFN/ strengthens and stabilizes BBB function during WNV infection (10) astrocyte IFNAR signaling regulates infiltration of inflammatory cells specifically in the cerebellum. underlying mechanisms involved IFN/mediated suppression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression, an integrin that facilitates immune cell trafficking during CNS infection (11) lack of virus control in absence of astrocyte IFNAR was thus attributed to impaired T cell recruitment and/or local function. microglia indeed exhibited significantly reduced MHC class II surface expression coincident with a failure to induce IFN-dependent class II transactivator (CIITA) IFN/ induced by Listeria monocytogenes suppresses IFN-mediated macrophage activation by inhibiting induction of CIITA mRNA and MHCII. IFN/ suppresses recruitment of neutrophil by inhibiting its chemoattractants (20,40) astrocyte-derived CXCL1 induced during sterile neuroinflammation also plays a key role in neuropathic pain by ligating its receptor CXCR2 on neurons. this review highlights the role of astrocytes in innate immune protection from neurotropic RNA virus infections, including those thought to be primarily neuron-tropic. IFNAR signaling specifically in astrocytes promotes BBB integrity. astrocytes can be more potent sources of IFN than productively infected neurons. astrocytes can be more potent sources of IFN than productively infected neurons. crosstalk between IFN/-inducing and -responder cells determine pathogenic outcome. author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist."}
