{"summary": "oligomeric nucleic acids have a considerable potential to be used as therapeutics. aptamers, decoy oligonucleotides, ribozymes, triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO), immunostimulatory CpG motifs and antisense oligonucleotides have attained much interest as a research tool. nucleic acids are virtually non-immunogenic compared to protein- or peptide-based approaches. stability, bio-availability and pharmacokinetics come into play. these drawbacks can be resolved by appropriate chemical modifications. despite substantial efforts over the last 15 years, research has failed to develop suitable and especially safe viral systems. liposomes and cationic polymers are used as a standard tool to transfect cells in vitro. these approaches are characterised by a significant lack of efficiency accompanied by a high level of toxicity rendering them mostly inadequate for in vivo applications. peptide-mediated delivery of nucleic acids began to develop. in this review we will report about recent progress in the field of peptide-mediated delivery of nucleic acids. we will present own data on peptide-mediated siRNA delivery. early work relied on fluorescence imaging or flow cytometry analysis of chemically fixed cells to examine intracellular localisation of fluorescently labelled peptides. peptides seemed to be internalised very rapidly within minutes even at 4 \u00b0C. from such observations it was concluded that CPPs penetrate cell membranes by an energy-independent mechanism. eukaryotic cells take up macromolecules and particles from the surrounding medium by a process called endocytosis. this process occurs in all cells by at least four basic mechanisms. the best-studied endocytosis pathway is the clathrin-coated pit pathway. uncoated endocytic vesicles then fuse with one another and with early endosomes in a reaction requiring the small GTPase Rab5. Eventually, early to late endosome transport may be mediated by small vesicular intermediates. late endosomes are then thought to fuse with pre-lysosomes to form \u2018hybrid\u2019 organelles. despite the different agents used to stimulate caveolar internalisation there are common mechanisms involved in these pathways with a crucial role for dynamin, Src kinases, protein kinase C and actin recruitment. other less well-defined pathways (i.e. clathrin- and caveolin-independent, lipid-raft endocytosis) that differ from the routes described above [32]. recent studies indicate that the uptake mechanism of CPPs can be influenced by the attachment of cargos. the precise mechanism of internalisation remains elusive and strongly depends on the properties of both CPP and cargo as well as on the transfection conditions and the cell lines used. in the first part examples of \u2018classical\u2019 CPPs are given. the second part highlights more recent developments in the field. there, several new peptide sequences and concepts will be presented. mPrPp MANLGYWLLALFVTMWTDVGLCKKRPKP [72,73] bPrPp MVKSKIGSWILVLFVAMWSDVGLCKKRPKP [73,73] bPrPp MVTVLFRRLRIRRACGPPRVRV [54] CPP5s VPMLK, PMLKE (human), VPTLK (mouse), VPALR (rat) [75] EB1 LIRLWS penetratin penetratin is a peptide derived from the third helix of the homeodomain protein. it is one of the most widely investigated CPPs exerting low toxicity and a high translocation rate. it is one of the most widely investigated CPPs exerting low toxicity and a high translocation rate. transportan and derivatives transportan were originally developed by the group of Langel [64]. it is composed of the N-terminal amino acids of the neuropeptide galanin. transportan led to TP10, a peptide with 21 residues displaying similar properties as the initial peptide. studies with several branched versions of oligoarginine indicated that the number of arginine residues is much more important than the structure per se. a direct comparison of nonamers composed of arginine, histidine, lysine or ornithine revealed that arginine residues were most effective in penetrating the plasma membrane. transport of covalently attached short peptides and PNAs was reported. transport of oligonucleotides and transport of covalently or non-covalently into mammalian cells was reported. a splice correcting PNA and different KLA analogues was used. hydrophobic peptide/peptide interactions lead to the formation of nanoparticles. hCT is a 32 amino acid peptide hormone involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. it is therapeutically used in osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. hCT9\u201332-br showed ability to promote internalisation of plasmids into human neuroblastoma cells by formation of complexes through non-covalent interactions. the rate of transfection was significantly higher than the efficiency observed for the commercial transfection reagent LipofectamineTM (LF) or a linear fusion of hCT9\u201332 to the SV40-NLS. peptide M918 M918 consists of 22 amino acids including seven arginine residues. it was derived from the C-terminus of the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF. the peptide delivered conjugated PNA into cells at a concentration of 5 M. sweet arrow peptide (SAP) is derived from the proline-rich N-terminal repetitive domain of gamma-zein. polyprolines adopt a well defined helical structure (polyproline II) in water, conserved even if the peptide contains only 50 % proline residues. it is possible to generate an amphipathic helix by introducing polar amino acids. Dermaseptin derived peptide S413-PV is composed of 13 amino acids derived from the dermaseptin S4 peptide and the SV40 large T-antigen NLS. no cytotoxicity was detected up to at least 1 mM of all SAP-analogues. cell-penetration properties reported for a peptide derived from the unprocessed N-terminus of mouse prion protein (mPrPp, [72]. mPrPp alone or coupled to fluorescently labelled avidin was internalised into mouse neuroblastoma cells N2a. cellular uptake was also shown for a peptide derived from bovine prion protein (bPrPp) human peptides with the sequences VPMLK and PMLKE and a sequence from the mouse and the rat were tested for cell-penetration. the sequences IPMIK, KLPVM and KLPVT were non-toxic up to concentrations of 1 mM. the first is an example of a branched polymer consisting only of alternating histidines and lysines. a different type of branching proved specifically advantageous for siRNA delivery. a second example are Tat-grafted PEGylated nanocarriers. the \u2018multifunctional envelope-type nano device\u2019 (MEND) was developed according to a rational strategy that takes into account the stability of particles, their entry into the cell as well as the release of the cargo into the cytoplasm or the nucleus. the modular system can be changed or supplemented to meet different needs such as PEGylation for in vivo studies. cytosis of IRQ-MEND via caveolae as opposed to R8-MEND. encapsulated siRNA was imported into the cells and readily set free from endosomes only if they used a fusogenic lipid envelope for the MEND [189] authors showed that encapsulated siRNA was imported into the cells and readily set free from endosomes. penetratin penetratin is a peptide derived from the third helix of the homeodomain protein. it is one of the most widely investigated CPPs exerting low toxicity and a high translocation rate. retro- and enantio-modified versions showed comparable properties in earlier studies. transportan and derivatives transportan were originally developed by the group of Langel [64]. it is composed of the N-terminal amino acids of the neuropeptide galanin. transportan led to TP10, a peptide with 21 residues displaying similar properties as the initial peptide. studies with several branched versions of oligoarginine indicated that the number of arginine residues is much more important than the structure per se. a direct comparison of nonamers composed of arginine, histidine, lysine or ornithine revealed that arginine residues were most effective in penetrating the plasma membrane because of their guanidinium group. covalently attached short peptides, PNAs and transport of oligonucleotides were reported. a splice correcting PNA and different KLA analogues showed less or no activity. a localisation of the peptide at the N-terminus of the PNA was crucial for attaining antisense activity. MPG was shown to deliver DNA oligonucleotides, plasmid DNA, and siRNA into mammalian cells. different derivatives of MPG have been described [68,132\u2013135]. truncated versions of Tat showed the highest transfection efficiency. the guanidinium group was shown to be superior to other cationic groups in the sequence. the transport of non-covalently bound plasmid DNA [91\u201393] has been demonstrated. studies show transportan is even more potent in delivering a conjugated PNA for splice correction than penetratin or Tat. a modified version of penetratin concerning the endosomal release of internalised siRNA [76] and with the attachment of a hexaarginine (R6) to the N-terminus of penetratin concerning the delivery of a splice correcting PNA. oligoarginines and other arginine-rich peptides are efficiently taken up by cells. the molecule with the highest efficiency turned out to be octaarginine (R8). peptides of 5 and > 12 arginine residues showed only negligible translocation. flow cytometry analysis revealed that R9 was internalised to a similar degree as penetratin, but to a significantly larger extent than Tat peptide. MAP is derived from the -helical amphipathic model peptide KLALKALKAALKLA, designed by Steiner et al. [125] MPG and Pep families MPG is a 27 amino acid peptide composed of a hydrophobic domain derived from the N-terminal fusion sequence of the HIV-1 glycoprotein 41. a hydrophilic domain derived from the nuclear localisation sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen are linked by a 3 amino acid spacer. hCT is a 32 amino acid peptide hormone involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. it is therapeutically used in osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. direct application of hCT to the nasal epithelium has been proposed to be as effective as intravenous injections. hCT9\u201332-2br showed the highest transfection rate for HEK 293 cells and rat hippocampal neurons. hCT18\u201332-k7 was more efficient for neuroblastoma cells and primary chicken cardiomyocytes. a couple of analogues with modifications or D-amino acids were synthesised. chloroquine led to a slight enhancement of the biological effect mediated by the M918/PNA-conjugate and application of the endocytosis inhibitors cytochalasin D and wortmannin suggested micropinocytosis was involved in the cellular uptake into HeLa cells. a fully protease resistant version (i.e. all-D SAP) was synthesised in order to increase the stability of the peptide [149]. this analogue retained the cell-penetrating activity and hence was investigated in a preliminary uptake study in mice [150]. no bioactive cargo has been introduced so far, this study highlights the use of D-amino acids for in vivo approaches. 13-PV and two analogue peptides revealed that the formation of helical structures upon peptide/lipid interaction depends on the order of amino acids in the peptide. authors suggested that the higher content of helical conformation allows direct penetration of the cellular membrane. no detailed toxicity study has been published. pentapeptides (CPP5) Ku70, a protein that plays an important role in DNA repair, were found to bind Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), thereby inhibiting its apoptosis activating function [75] peptides with the sequences VPMLK and PMLKE, as well as a sequence from the mouse and the rat were tested for cell-penetration. a main goal of such approaches is to generate nanoparticles with defined properties (e.g. size and charge distribution) there are attempts to combine peptides with cationic liposomes. other applications are aimed at synthesis of high or low molecular weight branched polymers. hydrazone bond-based PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugates undergo self-assembly to form micelles in aqueous solutions. when the pH is lowered, these nanocarriers lose their PEG coating resulting in exposure of Tat. acidic microenvironments like those found in tumours or ischemic tissues are specifically targeted. heptapeptide IRQ was integrated into the MEND surface. it triggered endocytosis of IRQ-MEND via caveolae as opposed to R8-MEND. hCT is a 32 amino acid peptide hormone involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. hCT9\u201332 resulted in a branched peptide (hCT9\u201332-br) which showed the ability to promote internalisation of plasmids into human neuroblastoma cells by formation of complexes through non-covalent interactions. the rate of transfection was significantly higher than the efficiency observed for the commercial transfection reagent LipofectamineTM. 918 M918 consists of 22 amino acids including seven arginine residues. it was derived from the C-terminus of the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF. FITC-labelled streptavidin was taken up by cells after formation of non-covalent complexes. polyprolines adopt a well defined helical structure (polyproline II) in water, conserved even if the peptide contains only 50 % proline residues. it is possible to generate an amphipathic helix by introducing polar amino acids at certain positions. dermatologins constitute a large family of polycationic antimicrobial peptides. the peptides adopt an amphipathic -helical structure in apolar solvents. this structural feature was shown to mediate cell permeabilisation upon specific interactions with phospholipids. avidin was internalised into mouse neuroblastoma cells N2a. peptide derived from bovine prion protein (bPrPp) showed both diffuse fluorescence in the cytosol after 1 \u2013 3 h of incubation. macropinocytosis was suggested as the main mechanism of uptake for bPrPp. pentapeptides (termed CPP5s) can be categorised as the shortest CPPs [102,163] in order to avoid the Bax-inhibiting property, some amino acids were exchanged or inverted producing CPPs with the sequences IPMIK, KLPVM and KLPVT. the mode of entry into the cell, however, as well as a potential involvement of cellular receptors is still unknown. polymers and/or peptides are particularly promising with respect to in vivo delivery. the first is an example of a branched polymer consisting only of alternating histidines and lysines. a different type of branching proved specifically advantageous for siRNA delivery. modular system can be modified or supplemented to meet different needs such as PEGylation for in vivo studies. plasmid DNA delivery of this system was comparable with that of adenovirus without inducing any cytotoxicity [179,186]. MEND and other delivery systems offer the possibility to develop cell-type specific therapeutic strategies. oligomeric nucleic acids include siRNA, antisense, decoy and triplex forming oligonucleotides. examples of plasmid delivery are listed due to their importance as vehicles for intracellular expression of small RNAs. Plasmid bPrPp endocytotic [161] DNA/looped DNA plasmid DNA hCT9\u201332-2br, hCT18\u201332-k7 endocytotic [142] plasmid DNA R-PAMAM-PEG-PAMAM-R dendrimer endocytotic [183,184] plasmid DNA R8-MEND3 endocytotic [179] Table 5. it has been shown that Tat peptides bind to DNA and other polyanions to form complexes which then interact with the membrane of different cells followed by internalisation through endocytosis. oligomeric Tat47\u201357 was found to be more efficient than tetramers. POLYTAT promotes the formation of more stable complexes. this could be increased by the addition of the lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine. this could even exceed the level of PEI-mediated transfection. expression levels were much lower than measured after LF2000-mediated transfection. branched peptides hCT9\u201332-2br and hCT18\u201332-k7 could reach the transfection rate of LipofectamineTM 2000 (LF2000) in the cell lines HEK 293, HeLa, MCT-7, COS-7 and SK-N-MC or in primary cells. in vivo, gene expression was mostly detected in lung and spleen, in addition to tumour tissue. in vivo, after systemic administration of a luciferase plasmid in mice with xenograft tumour, gene expression was mostly detected in lung and spleen. antisense oligonucleotides are complementary to the RNA of interest. the oligonucleotide/RNA duplex may form a substrate for endogenous RNase H, leading to mRNA cleavage. the oligonucleotide/RNA duplex may alter pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus. PNAs are resistant to nucleases and proteases because they lack anomeric carbon atoms and standard amino acids. they bind to single-stranded DNAs through the unique mechanism of so-called strand invasion. they lack anomeric carbon atoms and standard amino acids. TP10 with the same PNA were inactive when delivered alone. but attained transactivation inhibition in the presence of chloroquine. a cleavable bond is not essential for activity in this assay. no nuclear import was observed by confocal microscopy. in order to generate a net positive charge of the conjugates, additional basic amino acids were introduced into the peptide sequence. the rate of uptake was dramatically enhanced by addition of free CPP to the conjugates. these findings are in contrast to the results of Turner et al. [208] described above, who could not find a biological effect. this discrepancy may simply be due to differences between the two biological assays. oligoarginines with non-natural, uncharged amino acids [218] led to the peptide (R-Ahx-R)4 in which Ahx represents a six-atom aminohexanoic acid spacer. the second peptide is a derivative of penetratin, to which six arginine residues were added at the N-terminus. in vivo efficacy has already been demonstrated in mouse models for muscular dystrophy and coronavirus infection using another variant of the (R-Ahx-R)4-peptide described above. a mouse xenograft tumour model of human prostate carcinoma was used to analyse in vivo delivery of Pep-3/HypNA-pPNA complexes. incubation with an unconjugated PNA led to a complete knockdown of miR-122. incubation with an unconjugated PNA was only modified with 4 lysine residues. this resulted in 80 % inhibition of the NFB binding activity. oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind as a third strand in the major groove of duplex DNA to form triplex DNA in a sequence-specific manner. a TFO coupled to penetratin by disulfide linkage was shown to internalise into cells. the rate of mutation was enhanced by a factor of 20 compared to basal levels. the sequence of the oligonucleotide cargo affected the efficiency of delivery and the pattern of intracellular distribution. siRNAs represent a further valuable antisense tool to inhibit the expression of a target gene in a sequence-specific manner. a significant increase in the rate of uptake of siRNAs targeted against luciferase or GFP could be observed after disulfide coupling the 5\u2032-end of the sense strand to penetratin or transportan. the observed down regulation of the target proteins after peptide-mediated siRNA delivery was found to be far more effective compared to LF2000. EB1 showed improved delivery with a reduction of luciferase activity to approximately 50 % at 100 nM siRNA. added a pH-sensitive peptide derived from haemagglutinin (HA2) can promote endosomal escape. EB1 has superior endosomolytic activity in comparison to HA2-penetratin. siRNA cores were packaged into a lipidic envelope to form R8-MEND. it was shown that siRNA/STR-R8 particles with STR-R8-condensed siRNA yielded the smallest complexes and the most efficient silencing effect in HeLa cells. the attachment of the tripeptide RGD, an integrin-ligand, only slightly enhanced siRNA delivery, but turned this carrier into a cell-specific system. it is one of the first groups to report on Tat48\u201360- or penetratin-mediated siRNA delivery in vivo. they show that even unmodified and non-formulated siRNA can exert a significant silencing effect at least in some in vivo studies. the biotinylated form of the 29-amino-acid peptide (YTIWMPENPRPGTPCDIFTNSRGKRASNG) was taken up by neuronal cells in the brain after injection into mice. in order to transport nucleic acids with this vehicle, R9 was conjugated to RVG peptide. antiviral siRNA treatment resulted in successful protection of mice. the authors also studied the efficiency of rCPPs for cellular delivery of siRNA. a low NLS-content in the polyplex was favourable for posttranscriptional cytoplasmic RNAi, whereas a higher NLS-content promoted nuclear delivery. this even excelled the efficiency of the commercial transfection reagent TransIT-TKO. dimers and trimers of oligomeric Tat47\u201357 were found to be more efficient than tetramers. this so-called POLYTAT consists of a mixture of linear polymers of Tat peptide molecules cross linked by disulfide bridges. this could be increased by the addition of the lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine. branched peptides reached the same level of transfection as LF. similar results were obtained for Tat48\u201360. none of the branched human calcitonin derivatives could reach LF2000. both branched CPPs delivered the plasmids into all cells via endocytosis. the protein expression level in neuroblastoma cells was 1.5-fold higher than after LF2000-mediated transfection. a novel arginine-grafted polymer was developed by Kim et al. antisense oligonucleotides are complementary to the RNA of interest. the oligonucleotide/RNA duplex may form a substrate for endogenous RNase H, leading to mRNA cleavage. oligonucleotide/RNA duplex may prevent the productive assembly of the ribosomal complex. peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are nucleic acid mimics in which the ribose-phosphate skeleton has been exchanged with a simpler polyamide backbone. peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are resistant to nucleases and proteases because they lack anomeric carbon atoms and standard amino acids. a corresponding 21mer PNA was coupled to penetratin or transportan. it was reported that a 16mer PNA coupled to transportan was internalised. the conjugate substantially inhibited HIV-1 production in chronically HIV-1 infected H9 cells. the authors suggested that these free CPPs form complexes with CPP-cargo conjugates, which play a significant role in the uptake process. they concluded that the construct should be nontoxic in the concentration range predicted for a future therapeutic use. the conjugates targeted to the aberrant splice site caused an increase in luciferase activity in a dose-responsive manner. the conjugates targeted to the aberrant splice site, but not the mismatched controls, caused an increase in luciferase activity in a matter of hours. splice correction assay could show that missplicing of pre-mRNA was corrected upon addition of a R9F2-PMO conjugate into cell culture medium at low micromolar concentrations. arginine-rich peptide R9F2 showed higher transfection rates than conjugates with Tat peptide, penetratin or a Tat peptide analogue. other studies show inhibition of coronavirus, flavivirus, dengue virus and west Nile virus replication by the uptake of (R-Ahx-R)4 constructs was less efficient than the uptake of Tat or oligoarginine constructs. the second peptide is a derivative of penetratin, to which six arginine residues were added at the N-terminus (R6Pen) a mouse xenograft tumour model of human prostate carcinoma was used to analyse in vivo delivery of pep-3/HypNA-pPNA complexes. intravenous administration reduced tumour growth by approximately 20 %, but after intratumoural injection, a specific and concentration-dependent inhibition of tumour growth up to 90 % was detected. microRNAs (miRNAs), a conserve class of small non-coding RNAs, participate in the post-transcriptional oligonucleotides are a powerful tool to modulate gene expression. coupling a NFB specific decoy to either transportan or TP10 could show efficient cellular translocation of this construct going along with an inhibition of interleukin(IL)-1-induced NFB activation and NFB downstream effects. oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind as a third strand in the major groove of duplex DNA to form triplex DNA in a sequence-specific manner. attractive applications include not only inhibition of the target gene, but also induction of point mutations at predetermined sites. a TFO coupled to penetratin by disulfide linkage was shown to internalise into cells. a mutation in the NLS sequence of the carrier peptide (MPGNLS) resulted in a slight increase of the RNAi effect. siRNAs were non-covalently complexed with the peptide MPG. this led to a strong down regulation of the target protein. siRNAs directed against endogenous proteins were coupled to penetratin via a disulfide bond. the observed down regulation of the target proteins was found to be far more effective compared to LF2000. this in part was attributed to the toxicity of the lipids. a pH-sensitive peptide derived from haemagglutinin (HA2) can promote endosomal escape. EB1 has a superior endosomolytic activity in comparison to HA2-penetratin. in addition to EB1, MPGNLS and bPrPp were analysed in this study. a promising result with a prospect for cell specific siRNA delivery was presented by leng et al. in an attempt to optimise a branched histidine/lysine-polymer for siRNA delivery. the authors found that different 8 branched versions (H3K8b) yielded up to 80 % knockdown of the target gene in several cell types. the peptides alone triggered a detectable decrease in target gene expression. the penetratin-conjugate induced elevated levels of the immune markers IFN-, TNF-, and IL-12p40 in lung tissue [106]. a conclusion cannot easily be extrapolated from in vitro experiments and applied to the experimental conditions. the first study to report on a non-toxic method to deliver siRNA across the blood brain barrier. a primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) comprising 183 nucleotides has been transferred into the nucleus of HeLa cells after complexation with the so called reducible copolypeptide. this linear delivery system is composed of the lysine-containing histidine-rich peptide (HRP) and the SV40 large T-antigen NLS randomly connected via we have adapted a highly sensitive method described by Overhoff et al. [238] for the quantification of siRNA, enabling us to detect intracellular siRNA amounts down to 10 copies per cell. by implementing a heparin wash, we could reduce the overall amount of allegedly \u2018intracellular\u2019 siRNA by about 90 % [236]. e forms highly stable non-covalent non-covalent complexes with nucleic acids. the peptide differs from MPG by six amino acids in the hydrophobic part. these changes result in an alteration of the overall structure of the peptide towards a higher tendency of adopting a helical conformation. luciferase activity was measured in a plate reader and cell numbers were normalised with fluorescein diacetate. the IC50-value of 0.8 nM was calculated using the program Grafit. this strongly indicates endocytosis to be involved in uptake. a confocal laser scanning microscope was performed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). a quantitative comparison of cargo taken up and functionally active is essential to analyse their biological effects inside the cell. resolving the problem of endosomal escape currently is the main challenge for this CPP-system. current reports provide increasing evidence that peptides represent a promising alternative to viral and lipid-based nucleic acid delivery systems."}
