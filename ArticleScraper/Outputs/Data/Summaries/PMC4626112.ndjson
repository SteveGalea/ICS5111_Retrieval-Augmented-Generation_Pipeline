{"summary": "a novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified in southeast china in 2002. a novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) spread worldwide to more than 30 countries within six months. in september 2012, a novel coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in two patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia. rSARS-CoV-E is a promising vaccine candidate. a major safety concern with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility of reversion to a pathogenic form. a major safety concern with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility of reversion to a pathogenic form. lacking the E protein PBM led to regeneration of viral proteins containing PBMs. the deletions were not observed after passage of SARS-CoVs with mutated E protein that retained the PBM. if only small deletions of 8\u201312 amino acids were introduced into the carboxy-terminus of E protein with retention of the PBM, the SARS-CoVs generated were attenuated and genetically stable. we infected vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells with rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-E or rSARS-CoV-[E,6-9b]. supernatants were serially passaged 16 times and the distal third of the genome, from the S gene to the 3 end (around 8 kb), was sequenced using specific primers. chimeric membrane genes generated after 16 serial passages (p16) formed by partial duplication of membrane gene fused to part of SARS-CoV leader sequence (green boxes) chimeric membrane genes generated after 16 serial passages (p16) are formed by a partial duplication of membrane gene fused to part of SARS-CoV leader sequence (green boxes) rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-E, rSARS-CoV-E, rSARS-CoV-E-MCH-Vero and rSARS-CoV-E-MCH-DBT were mock infected or infected with different recombinant viruses. the expression of native M and MCH was confirmed at 24 hpi by Western blot analysis. in vero E6 cells (MCH-Vero) grew better in this cell line than in DBT-mACE2 cells. the MCH protein provided a growth advantage for the virus. subconfluent monolayers of vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected with wt, E, MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT viruses. mice were intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of wt, E, MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT viruses. weight loss and survival were monitored for 10 days. data represent two independent experiments with 5 mice per group. mice infected with rSARS-CoV were highly edematous and showed profuse hemorrhagic areas at 2 and especially at 4 dpi. analysis of lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV revealed extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in alveolar and bronchiolar airways. in altPBM, the PBM was abolished by mutating the last 4 amino acids to glycine, maintaining the full-length E protein. in altPBM, 4 amino acids within E protein carboxy-terminal region were mutated to alanine, maintaining an active PBM domain. recombinant viruses were passaged 16 times in vero E6 cells. the presence of chimeric genes and E protein PBMs was analyzed. Schematic indicating the presence and sequence (green) or absence (red) of PDZ-binding motifs at the end of the different E proteins (E PBM) at passages 0 (p0) and 16 (p16) membrane domain of 3a protein and a PBM composed by the last nine amino acids of 3a protein. both viruses were passaged 16 times in vero E6 cells. incorporation of a PBM domain after passage in the mouse lung MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT showed an attenuated phenotype. V or SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup showed substantial perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial cellular infiltration and edema at 2 and 4 dpi. the engineered virus (rSARS-CoV-E-8a-dup) was as virulent as the SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup generated after serial passage in vivo. 16-week-old mice were intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of wt, E and E-8a-dup viruses. weight loss and survival were monitored for 10 days. data represent two independent experiments with 5 mice per group. assessed at 24 hpi using a phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38)-specific antibody. analysis of p38 MAPK activation and inflammatory cytokines expression during infection with recombinant SARS-CoV-E virus. viruses at a moi of 0.3 and the presence of active phosphorylated (p-p38) and total (p38) p38 MAPK was detected by Western blot analysis at 24 hpi. phosphorylated p38/total p38 MAPK ratio was quantified by densitometric analysis. infection with the recombinant virus lacking E protein at passage 0 (SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup) did not induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the engineered virus (rSARS-CoV-E-8a-dup) induced similar p38 MAPK activation. mutant viruses were generated by introducing deletions of 8 to 11 amino acids into the nsp1 protein (rSARS-CoV-nsp1-A, -B, -C and -D Fig 8A) all the deletion mutants grew to similar titers as rSARS-CoV in vero E6 cells. however the A and B mutants grew to lower titers in DBT-mACE2 cells. mice infected with rSARS-CoV-nsp1-A or rSARS-CoV-nsp1-B lost 20 and 15% of their initial weight by day 3. survival reduced to 60 and 80%, respectively. no significant changes on gross inspection of lungs or in their weight were observed when the lungs of mock-infected and SARS-CoV-nsp1-C and -D-infected mice were compared. rSARS-CoV-infected mice showed lung weight increase, not observed with the lungs of rSARS-CoV-nsp1*-infected mice. the most attenuated viruses were those that induced less lung pathology in V-nsp1-C and -D induced higher levels of IFN- and ISGs (IRF1, DDX58, and STAT1), compared to mock-infected and rSARS-CoV-infected cells. deletion of regions C and D of nsp1 restored IFN responses, leading to virus attenuation. mock-vaccinated mice immunized with rSARS-CoV-nsp1-C and -D mutants. mice immunized with 6000 pfu of SARS-CoV-nsp1-C and -D mutants. weight loss (A) and survival (B) were recorded daily. resulting virus grew to relatively high titers in vivo. subconfluent monolayers of vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected with wt, E and 3 viruses at a moi of 0.001. titer in lungs was determined at 2 and 4 days post infection. infected with wt, SARS-CoV-nsp1D-E and SARS-CoV-nsp1D-E at passage 1 and 10 (-p1 and -p10C) viruses at a moi of 0.001. at different times post infection, virus titers were determined by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. all mice infected with rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E were intranasally inoculated with recombinant viruses. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3 grew more efficiently than p10C virus. no obvious gross lesions or changes in weight were observed in lungs. viruses containing the E3 mutation remained stable after 10 passages. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3 was passaged 10 times (p10M), followed by sequencing from the S gene. only two changes were observed in the viral sequence, one in the E gene (A26250T NI), and a second in the M gene (A26450G QR). mutations could be compensatory mutations, virus titers at p1 and p10 were compared in vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3 (p10M) at different times post-infection were the same as those observed for rSARS-CoV. mice infected with rSARS-CoV started to lose weight by day 2. at day 5 the mice started to regain weight, fully recovered from the disease. at day 5 the mice started to regain weight, fully recovered from the disease. mice were challenged with rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-E or rSARS-CoV-[E,6-9b] at 21 days postimmunization. non-immunized mice lost weight and all died on day 6 after challenge. vaccination with attenuated mutant viruses completely protected mice against challenge with rSARS-CoV. no chimeric proteins were detected after serial passage of the parental virus. all MCH genes encoded the amino terminus and the three transmembrane domains of M and also different PDZ-binding motifs at the carboxy-terminus of the protein. chimeric genes were already detected within 5 passages in both cells lines. presence of native membrane and chimeric membrane proteins was analyzed by Western blot at 24 hpi using two polyclonal antibodies generated to recognize either all membrane proteins, chimeric or not (C) or a unique sequence in the chimeric protein generated after SARS-CoV-E passage in cell culture. expression of viral sgmRNAs corresponding to the chimeric genes was characterized by RT-PCR. the growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-E-MCH-Vero and SARS-CoV-E-MCH-DBT (MCH-DBT) were analyzed. chimeric proteins seemed to be specific for each cell type, as a chimeric protein grew better in this cell line than in DBT-mACE cells. culture supernatants collected at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hpi were titrated by plaque assay. mice were intranasally infected with the recombinant viruses using 100,000 pfu. weight loss and survival were monitored for 10 days. mice were intranasally inoculated with the recombinant viruses and euthanized at 2 and 4 dpi. rSARS-CoV-E replicated in the lung to higher levels than those containing the chimeric proteins (MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT) at both days p.i. chimeric protein MCH was generated after rSARS-CoV-E passage in cell culture, but not when full-length E protein was present. a set of recombinant SARS-CoVs with mutations or deletions in different regions of E protein was passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells. in mutPBM, the last 9 amino acids of E protein were deleted, truncating the carboxy-terminus and eliminating the E protein PBM. natants were serially passaged 16 times in vero E6 cells. the presence of chimeric genes was determined by sequence analysis. a virus incorporating the chimeric MCH protein was only generated when E protein was completely deleted (E), i.e., when the restoration of a PBM on the E protein was not possible. chimeric protein was formed by the first transmembrane domain of 3a protein and a PBM composed by the last nine amino acids of 3a protein. both viruses were passaged 16 times in vero E6 cells and compensatory mutations were not detected after sequencing. to further analyze whether SARS-CoV requires a transmembrane protein displaying a PBM. a partial duplication of 45 nucleotides was found within 8a gene. this led to the incorporation of a fragment of 15 amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of 8a protein, and generating a novel 8a protein (8a-dup) with an internal PBM (CTVV) to determine the virulence of this novel virus, we infected a new cohort of BALB/c mice. -dup was as virulent as the SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup generated after serial passage in vivo. results indicated that SARS-CoV-E regained virulence after serial passage in mice. 16-week-old mice were intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of wt or E-8a-dup viruses. mechanisms involving SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup reversion to virulence SARS-CoV infection is associated with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. the graph shows the phosphorylated p38/total p38 MAPK ratio in vero E6 cells infected with wt, E and E-8a-dup viruses at 24 hpi. the presence of active phosphorylated (p-p38) and total (p38) p38 MAPK was detected by Western blot analysis at 24 hpi. expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lungs of infected mice evaluated by RT-qPCR at 2 dpi. chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and interleukin 6 (IL6). reversion of SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup to a virulent phenotype was associated with an exacerbated immune response similar to that triggered during infection with the rSARS-CoV. to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations within the SARS-CoV nsp1 gene. the conserved amino acids in these proteins are indicated in red. gray boxes represent the amino acids deleted within the nsp1 protein in A, B, C and D viruses. mutations were determined by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. virus titers were reduced compared to rSARS-CoV-infected mice. there was not a strict correlation between virus titers and virulence. nsp1 is involved in countering IFN production after infection. rSARS-CoV-nsp1*-infected mice showed no lung damage. the most attenuated viruses were those that induced less lung pathology in vivo. the most attenuated viruses were those that induced less lung pathology in vivo. DBT-mACE2 cells were mock-infected or infected with mutants or SARS-CoV (wt) cellular RNAs were extracted at 48 hpi. expression of the indicated genes was determined by RT-qPCR. weight loss (A) and survival (B) were recorded daily. mutant viruses with deletions in both nsp1 and E genes were engineered. rSARS-CoV deleted in the nsp1 D domain and the E protein (SARS-CoV-nsp1D-E) culture supernatants collected at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hpi were titrated by plaque assay. 16-week-old mice were intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of wt, E and 3 viruses. viral titer in lungs was determined at 2 and 4 days post infection (n = 3, each day) deletions introduced in both nsp1 and E genes were conserved. deletions in both nsp1 and E genes were found in vivo. mice infected with rSARS-CoV showed lung injury and a marked increase in the weight of lungs. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E was selected for further study. this virus showed higher titers in vivo as compared with the rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E virus. viral titers in lungs were determined at 2 and 4 days post infection. three independent mice per group were analyzed. original magnification was 20x and representative images are shown. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3-p10M mice were intranasally infected with 100,000 pfu of wt virus, or SARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3-p20M viruses. at different times post infection, virus titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3-p10M-infected mice presented no significant increase of inflammatory cytokines. despite mutations that the virus incorporated after their passage in mice, the virus maintained the in vivo attenuated phenotype. 6000 pfu of SARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3 viruses were mock-immunized or immunized with 100,000 pfu of wt virus (5 mice per group) weight loss (A) and survival (B) were recorded daily. all chimeric SARS-CoV M proteins generated in cell culture were expressed, enhancing virus growth in cell culture compared to rSARS-CoV-E. mice infected with rSARS-CoVs containing chimeric proteins showed a decrease in viral titers in the lungs of infected mice. 8a protein is a short transmembrane protein composed of 39 amino acids. deletions in 8a ORF have been transmitted and maintained in humans in the late phases of SARS-CoV epidemic. despite the CTVV sequence already present, it most likely does not represent a functional PBM. PDZ domains are among the modules most frequently involved in protein-protein interactions found in all metazoans. in the human genome, there are more than 900 PDZ domains in at least 400 different proteins. many pathogenic viruses produce PDZ ligands that disrupt host protein complexes for their own benefit. nsp1 was chosen as a second attenuation target because this gene is located at a distant site (>20 kb) from that of the E gene in the viral genome. a single recombination event with a circulating wt coronavirus could result in the restoration of a virulent phenotype. recombinant viruses encoding four different small deletions were generated. rSARS-CoV-nsp1D-E3, which contained deletions in nsp1 and E protein, maintained its attenuated phenotype after passage in vero E6 cells and in mice. titers of MHV deleted in nsp1 are restored almost to wild type levels in type I IFN deficient cells [46], consistent with our findings. infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) cDNA clones were rescued from infectious cDNA clones generated in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated at the age of 16 weeks with 100,000 plaque forming units (pfu) of the indicated viruses. all work with infected animals was performed in a BSL3 laboratory (CISA, INIA) pBAC-SfoI-MluI-SARS-CoV-nsp1* digested with restriction enzymes SfoI and MluI. fragments inserted into plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate plasmids. mutants pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1D-E and pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1 plasmid psl1190+BamHI/SacII contains a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26045 to 30091 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone. these constructs were cloned in the infectious pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E with the enzymes BamHI and SacII. restriction enzymes BamHI and NheI inserted into plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15. the fragments were digested with the same restriction enzymes. pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E-8a-dup plasmid was digested. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of the indicated recombinant viruses in 50 L of DMEM. two days after inoculation, mice were euthanized, and their lungs were removed. polyclonal antibodies were generated by Biogenes (Germany) as previously described [81] using synthetic peptides corresponding to the residues RTRSMWSFNPETNILLNVPLRGTIVTRPLM and PLMNLSLVL. total RNAs from DBT-mACE2 cells were extracted at 48 hpi using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. the results of three independent experiments and data analysis were MIQE compliant [82]. cellular gene expression was analyzed using a cDNA transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) specific for mouse genes. infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) cDNA clones were rescued from infectious cDNA clones. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 100,000 plaque forming units (pfu) of the indicated viruses. cDNA encoding the genome of SARS-CoV-MA15 strain was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmids pBAC-SfoI-MluI-SARS-CoV-nsp1* were digested with restriction enzymes SfoI and MluI. fragments were inserted into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, digested with the same restriction enzymes, to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1D-E3 plasmids. the plasmid psl1190+BamHI/SacII-SARS-CoV contains a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26045 to 30091 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone. these constructs were cloned in the infectious pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E with the enzymes BamHI and SacII. plasmid pBAC-BamHI-NheI-SARS-CoV-E-8a-dup was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and NheI. fragments were inserted into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, digested with the same restriction enzymes, to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E-8a-dup plasmid. viruses were rescued in BHK penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone) were performed in vero E6 cells. mice were sacrificed at 2 and 4 dpi, fixed in 10% zinc formalin for 24 h. phospho-p38 MAPK (dilution 1:500; Cell Signaling) and actin (dilution 1:10,000; Abcam) or polyclonal antibodies specific for M (dilution 1:1000; Biogenes) and MCH-DBT (dilution 1:1000; Biogenes) were generated by Biogenes (Germany) as previously described [81] using synthetic peptides corresponding to the residues RTRSMWSFNPETNILLNVPLRGTI -infected cells and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-nsp1-C and -D-infected cells were compared. all experiments and data analysis were MIQE compliant. expression of sgmRNAs was analyzed at 24 hpi using specific primers. expression of sgmRNAs was analyzed at 24 hpi using specific primers. sgmRNAs corresponding to chimeric genes generated after E passage. 16-week-old BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 100,000 pfu of wt, E, MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT viruses. weight of left lungs excised from infected mice sacrificed at the indicated days (n = 3, each day).
