{"summary": "TAs are present in the mammalian nervous system at levels much lower than those of common biogenic amines. TAs resemble common biogenic amines in terms of subcellular localization, chemical structure, and metabolism. TAs and amphetamine-like drugs show greater selectivity for TAAR1 relative to other aminergic receptors. the immune system is a complex collection of organs, tissues, and cells that serve to protect the host organism from pathogens. in its simplest form it can be subdivided into the innate and adaptive immune systems based on the temporal sequence of the immune response. for the purpose of this review we will follow this basic dichotomy. the human and mouse TAAR1 gene was selected (ID 134864 and 111174, respectively) a text search was conducted within the \u201cChange Dataset\u201d function. the GEO Profiles database was probed by cell type using the terms \u201cTAAR1 (AND ASTROCYTES\u201d. at least one sample was positive for TAAR1 expression are denoted as \u201cPartial\u201d in tables. cBioportal Processed RNAseq data representing 41,907 RNAseq samples across 171 cancer studies was obtained from cbioportal.org using a text search for \u201cTAAR1\u201d in the gene query tool. the TCGA transcriptomic profiling RNA-seq expression profiles for TAAR1 were obtained from the NIH National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/. RNA-seq dataset names begin with the prefix \u201cTCGA-\u201d followed by the abbreviation for the appropriate cancer type. the HR obtained for each study can be explained as the ratio of events (deaths) in the high TAAR1 expression group to events in the low TAAR1 expression group. to perform the meta-analysis, all HR values were log-transformed to normalize values around zero. datasets were extracted using the \u201cExpression profile\u201d function. the human and mouse TAAR1 gene was selected (ID 134864 and 111174, respectively) bioGPS Datasets for TAAR1 expression were extracted from http://biogps.org using the search function to query for \u201cTAAR1\u201d the human and mouse TAAR1 gene was selected (ID 134864 and 111174, respectively) individual GEO Profiles discussed in this review may be freely accessed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/. entire GEO Datasets may be accessed in the same manner at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds. cBioPortal Processed RNAseq data representing 41,907 RNAseq samples across 171 cancer studies was obtained from cbioportal.org using a text search for \u201cTAAR1\u201d in the gene query tool. cBioPortal Processed RNAseq data representing 41,907 RNAseq samples across 171 cancer studies was obtained from cbioportal.org using a text search for \u201cTAAR1\u201d in the gene query tool. cBioPortal Processed RNAseq data representing 41,907 samples across 171 cancer studies was obtained from cbioportal.org using a text search for \u201cTAAR1\u201d in the gene query tool. the TCGA transcriptomic profiling RNA-seq expression profiles for TAAR1 were obtained from the NIH National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/.

TAAR1 mRNA was identified in circulating human leukocytes using RT-PCR (D'Andrea et al., 2003; Nelson et al., 2007) 711 Human Positive Wynn et al., 2011 GDS4273 96184311 Human Positive Newell et al., 2010 GDS4266 85973511 Human Positive van Leeuwen et al., 2012 GDS4259 85768653 Human Positive van Leeuwen et al., 2008 GDS3325 81580189 Human Positive Berisha et al., 2011 GDS3881 71184862 Human Positive Juli\u00e0 et rita et al., 2013 GDS4974 108745653 Human Positive Shi et al., 2014 GDS4882 106226711 Human Positive Teles et al., 2013 GDS4551 98821011 Human Positive Hinze et al., 2010 GDS4267 96127911 Human Positive Moncrieffe et al., 2010 GDS4272 86177011 Human Positive Papapanou et al., 2007 GDS3326 platelets express TAAR1 RNA, suggesting a potential for a feedback mechanism in platelet function. platelets possess the machinery needed to translate RNA to protein. TAAR1 RNA detected may or may not be used by platelets to synthesize TAAR1 protein. expression in platelets could be a contributory mechanism of psychostimulant-induced effects on platelet-mediated immune responses. PBMCs include the B- and T-cells of adaptive immunity, as well as the natural killer (NK), NK T-cells, macrophage and dendritic cells of monocytic lineage of the innate immunity. work by Sriram et al. (2016) showed that viral antigenic exposure by HIV-1 infection upregulates TAAR1 protein in human PBMCs. upregulation is augmented by pretreatment with the TAAR1 agonist methamphetamine (METH) data from another study indicates that PBMCs infected with active or latent tuberculosis lacked detectable TAAR1 expression. one positive signal was obtained for a single uninfected sample. TAAR1 expression in both normal human PBMCs and those infected with Herpes simplex was absent. TAAR1 RNA is also present in human PBMCs isolated from gastric, liver, and pancreatic cancers (Shi et al., 2014, GDS4882), as well as breast cancer (LaBreche et al., 2011, GDS3952). TAAR1 levels are significantly higher in the earliest stage of erythropoiesis (n = 3) vs. the later 3 stages (n = 9). granulocytes are a type of innate immune cells that act as the first line of cellular defense due to their ability to be recruited to the site of infection through chemotaxis. when activated these cells migrate toward chemoattractants derived from pathogens or local macrophage. basophils are the rarest type of granulocyte and function in the initial infection response, allergic reactions, and in the adaptive immune response. TAAR1 and TAAR2 may represent markers for a granulocyte subset capable of chemosensory migration to TAs and other TAAR1 (and potentially TAAR2) ligands. potential drugs that selectively target TAAR1 could act in same manner to alter chemotactic activity of particular subsets of PMN. all the granulocytes profiled in these GEO datasets were normal cells. it would be interesting to investigate any changes in TAAR1 expression levels. innate immune cells such as neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune response, processing antigens and presenting them to helper T-cells (Th) cells. pathogen-specific immunological memory consisting of clonal populations of T- and B-cells that recognize and react to the initial specific antigen expressed by the pathogen. a search of datasets containing a probe representing the TAAR1 gene yielded 34 results of which 24 contained macrophage samples positive for TAAR1 expression. nine of the remaining ten datasets had a TAAR1 signal that fell below the threshold for detection. human positive (Partial) Dower et al., 2008 GDS3499 58902411 Human Positive (Partial) Ancuta et al., 2009 GDS4219 90466711 Human Positive (Partial) Menssen et al., 2009; Kyogoku et al., 2013 GDS4889 113428511 Human Positive (Partial) Maouche et al., 2008 GDS3553 60587246 Human Below Cutoff Wosz 2891211 Human Positive Woodruff et al., 2005 GDS1269 1269 Human Positive Sirois et al., 2011 GDS4232 91083411 Human Positive Wu et al., 2012 GDS4258 85690111 Human Positive Verway et al., 2013 GDS4781 02866053 Human Positive Zaritsky et al., 2015 GDS6082 132462276 Human Positive Khajoeee et al., 2006 G t al., 2011 GDS4432 92283261 Mouse Positive (Partial) Rosas et al., 2014 GDS5060 111205861 Mouse Below Cutoff Zhang, 2013 GDS5634 129339861 Mouse Below Cutoff Bok et al., 2009 GDS3549 60421061 Mouse Below Cutoff El Kasmi et al., 2009 GDS3549 60421061 Mouse Below Cutoff El Kasmi et al., 2009 86.7% of NK cells isolated from human buffy coat samples had some level of mRNA for TAAR1,2,5,6, or 9 that was detectable. NK cells isolated from mouse spleen also had detectable levels of gene transcripts for TAAR1,2,3, and 5. a unique cell type that combines phenotypic characteristics of both NK cells and T-cells, termed NKT-cells, possess enhanced killing ability. a targeted analysis of TAAR1 presence and function in this unique cell type is needed. 4863 112858353 Human Positive Lattin et al., 2008 GSE10246 N/A Mouse Positive Kong et al., 2014 GDS5428 125919274 Mouse Positive Stolp et al., 2012 GDS4340 83554161 Mouse Positive Chen S.

Stimulation with specific factors differentially activates T-cells to illicit the development of specific regulatory, effector, and helper functions. there is a lack of agreement and availability of literature exploring TAAR1 function in the immune system. the same study also reported that HIV-1 positive METH users displayed enhanced expression of TAAR1 protein in T-cells of the lymph nodes compared to non-users. current data suggest an association of TAAR1 expression, HIV-1 infection and METH and therefore more study of this possible connection is warranted. rhesus monkey B-cells express TAAR1 and other TAAR family members. B-cells express TAAR1 and TAAR2 as well as TAAR5,6, and 9 at lower levels. the ability of TAAR1 and TAAR2 co-expression to trigger IgE secretion in B-cells represents a new mechanism by which TAs directly alter immune cell function. the ability of TAAR1 and TAAR2 co-expression to trigger IgE secretion in B-cells represents a new mechanism by which TAs directly alter immune cell function. the brain's lack of native T- and B-cells that make up the adaptive immune response in the periphery is due to a largely impenetrable physical barrier between the tissue of the brain and the blood circulation. Astrocytes Astrocytes represent a dynamic component of neurological homeostasis, cell signaling, and immunological responses. TAAR1 RNA is present in mouse forebrain astrocytes (Lau et al., 2012, GDS3944), normal human astrocytes (Grzmil et al., 2011, GDS4467), and epidermal growth factor-treated rat astrocytes (Liu et al., 2006, GDS2146). TAAR1 RNA expression is positively correlated with increasing Braak staging, a clinical measurement of the progression of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. the difference could not be accounted for by age or developmental stage. datasets with \u201cabsent\u201d detection calls cannot be considered positive. however, it is still interesting to note that TAAR1 RNA was still measurable in other astrocytic samples from six other datasets. TAAR1 expression is detectable in the human microglial cell line HMO6 (Yoshino et al., 2011, GDS4151) and in mouse BV-2 microglia. ethanol treatment induced a 1.4-fold increase in TAAR1 expression in HMO6 microglia relative to DMSO control. TAAR1 RNA is present in these neuroimmune cell types. increased levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine paramount to sympathetic nervous system activation may act in a positive feedback loop. pathological changes in endogenous agonists for TAAR1 could underlie alterations in microglial functions. TAAR1 protein is highly expressed in the white and red pulp of the spleen and tonsillar germinal centers. TAAR1 protein is also highly expressed in lymphoid tissue and glandular cells of the appendix as well as glandular adrenal cells. expression appears to increase upon initial infection, decrease once the asymptomatic phase is reached, and return to control-baseline levels with progression to AIDS. TAARs are not significantly altered in HIV-1 infection, but trend toward upregulation with acute infection and downregulation with asymptomatic infection. a retrospective analysis of three microarray datasets retrieved from BioGPS representing 1,049 human cell samples revealed TAAR1 gene expression in various immune cells including astrocytes, peripheral blood cells, leukocytes, monocytes, macrophage, and neutrophils. TAAR1 was also present in low-medium levels in pancreatic islets. a literature search for TAAR1 agonists in cancer revealed a small subset of manuscripts describing amphetamine as a tumor-promoter. the potent TAAR1 agonist amphetamine has been linked to cancer pathology since at least the 1990s. AM is a derivative of thyroid hormone and has been shown to inhibit growth of cancerous cells in-vitro. in-vitro incubation of MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells resulted in reduced proliferation in an MTT assay. IC50 values of T1AM were twice as high for control human foreskin fibroblast cells. a similar gene-specific query in the Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus revealed that TAAR1 is statistically differentially expressed in breast, bladder, cervical, lung, pancreatic, stomach, renal, and thyroid cancer. most cancer types displayed median TAAR1 RNA expression levels of zero, which is in accord with the well-known phenomenon of TAAR1 expression being challenging. TAAR1 RNA was present at the lowest levels in cancers of the brain, pancreas, prostate, adrenal gland, stomach and esophagus, sex organs, and B-cells of the blood. median TAAR1 RNA levels were noticeably higher in the pan-kidney cohort representing KICH + KIRC + KIRP [KIPAN, n = 1020], Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma [KIRC, n = 607], P TAAR1 RNA is most highly expressed in the bone marrow neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH, normal human lung fibroblast cell line NHLF, human skeletal muscle cells, and the myoblast cell line HSMM. further exploration of TAAR1 expression in cancer cell lines utilizing the COSMIC database revealed TAAR1 deletions in two cancer cell lines. cancer RNA-seq Nexus datasets with differential TAAR1 RNA expression were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the R package RTCGA.rnaseq. values for the TAAR1 gene transcript were extracted, log2 transformed, and plotted with ggplot2. the minimal non-zero value for RNA expression levels was set to 1 to facilitate log2 transformation. cell line TPM FPKM QGP-1, pancreas, pancreatic islet cell carcinoma 241 69 UMC-11, lung, lung carcinoid tumor 130 37 VMRC-LCD, lung, lung adenocarcinoma 33 8 NCI-H810, lung, non-small cell lung carcinoma 24 6 NCI-H1092, lung, small cell lung carcinoma 21 6 BEN, lung, lung carcinoma 19 5 NCI-H2081, lung, small cell lung carcinoma 10 ma 0.5 COR-L47, lung, small cell lung carcinoma 0.5 Baseline RNAseq analysis of 622 human cancer cell lines. TAAR1 expression trends in overall survival cancer studies raises speculation of TAAR1 as a possible prognostic marker. hazard ratios were determined for TAAR1 expression bifurcated into high and low expression. all HR values were log-transformed to normalize values around zero. then back transformed to produce the average HR value denoted in Figure 2. survival of stage IIB cancer that had spread from the pancreas to the lymph nodes is significantly higher (HR = 4.79, p = 0.025) vs. stage IIA cancer that lacks lymph node involvement. TAAR1 may play a role in lymphoid cancer progression or pathways. TAAR1 RNA is present in leukocytes and TAAR1 RNA is consistently detected in whole blood. TAAR1 RNA is present in leukocytes and is consistently detected in whole blood. 105758811 Human Positive (Partial) Vierimaa et al., 2006 GDS2432 32521911 Human Positive (Partial) Vierimaa et al., 2011 GDS5231 118388438, 118388437 Human Negative Parnell et al., 2013 GDS4971 108634838, 108634837 Human Negative Parnell et al., 2011 GDS3919 72699438 Human Negative PLA platelets are thought to play a role in the initial innate immune response. platelets are also thought to play a role in the initial innate immune response. presence of TAAR1 RNA in platelets suggests a potential for platelet expression of TAAR1 protein and a potential for responses generated by TAAR1 agonists. platelets possess the machinery needed to translate RNA to protein. further investigation is necessary to examine protein expression and effects of selective TAAR1-targeted drugs on platelet function. cellular mitogen Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation is a well-known model of cellular activation. cellular mitogen Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation is a well-known model of cellular activation. TAAR1 is present at very low levels in normal physiological states. these data suggest that upregulation and activation of TAAR1 may be a mechanism by which anti-viral immune processes may be diminished or viral fitness is altered directly. it is intriguing to speculate that these effects may also occur in response to upregulation of TAAR1 resulting from amphetamine-like psychostimulant abuse. TAAR1 RNA is detectable in PBMCs of patients with inflammatory or immunological diseases osteoarthritis. TAAR1 RNA is also present in human PBMCs isolated from gastric, liver, and pancreatic cancers. TAAR1 levels are significantly higher in the earliest stage of erythropoiesis (n = 3) vs. the later 3 stages (n = 9). a further investigation into the disparity of TAAR1 expression between maturation stages may lend insight into a mechanism by which erythrocytic pathologies develop. TAs in response to injury or immune cell signals could have a functional role in the innate immune response. the presence of TAAR1 RNA in platelets suggests a potential for platelet expression of TAAR1 protein and responses generated by TAAR1 agonists. the presence of TAAR1 RNA in platelets suggests a potential for a feedback mechanism in platelet function. PBMCs include the B- and T-cells of adaptive immunity, as well as the natural killer (NK), NK T-cells, macrophage and dendritic cells of monocytic lineage of the innate immunity. PBMC transcriptomics are widely used to identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis. work by Sriram et al. (2016) showed that viral antigenic exposure by HIV-1 infection upregulates TAAR1 protein in human PBMCs. upregulation is augmented by pretreatment with the TAAR1 agonist methamphetamine (METH) this suggests that upregulation may be a mechanism by which anti-viral immune processes may be diminished or viral fitness is altered directly. fected with active or latent tuberculosis lacked detectable TAAR1 expression. one positive signal was obtained for a single uninfected sample. TAAR1 expression in both normal human PBMCs and those infected with herpes simplex was absent. TAAR1 RNA was also present, but not differentially expressed from controls, in datasets from pulmonary hypertension, interleukin-10 treatment and benzene exposure. TAAR1 levels are significantly higher in the earliest stage of erythropoiesis (n = 3) vs. the later 3 stages (n = 9). granulocytes include phagocytic neutrophils that act initially to engulf foreign invaders and eosinophils that function primarily in defense against parasitic infections. basophils are the rarest type of granulocyte and function in the initial infection response, allergic reactions, and in the T-cell polarization necessary for the adaptive immune response. potent TAAR1 agonist METH and other TAAR1-targeted compounds could act in same manner to alter chemotactic activity of particular subsets of PMN. expression data for mixed granulocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells revealed a consistent TAAR1 signal. these monocytic cells of the innate immune system are the first to arrive and provide a rapid response to engulf pathogens and induce inflammation. local phagocytic macrophages possess receptors called pattern recognition receptors that can recognize conserved pathogen antigens. monocytes demonstrate variation in TAAR subtype mRNA expression. 20% of monocytes screened did not express any of the TAAR genes. the TAAR2 signal was particularly high in this cell type. a TAAR1 signal was completely absent in only one of the 34 data sets. our analysis of a macrophage gene expression profile revealed significant TAAR1 upregulation with in vitro exposure to CXCL4.

Stimulation with specific factors differentially activates T-cells to illicit the development of specific regulatory, effector, and helper functions. these phenotypes in turn shape the nature of the immune response. there is a lack of agreement and availability of literature exploring TAAR1 function in the immune system. current data suggest an association of TAAR1 expression, HIV-1 infection and METH. it is important to note that this effect was reportedly due to TA interaction with both TAAR1 and TAAR2 as the effect was lost with siRNA knockdown of either receptor. taar1 and TAAR2 as well as TAAR5,6, and 9 at lower levels. taar1-dependent PKA and PKC phosphorylation in immortalized rhesus monkey B-cells. taar1-dependent phosphorylation in rhesus monkey B-cells. t-cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte important in the response to viral infection, detection of tumor formation, and promotion of self-tolerance. 86.7% of NK cells isolated from human buffy coat samples had some level of mRNA for TAAR1,2,5,6, or 9 that was detectable. a unique cell type that combines phenotypic characteristics. TAAR1 RNA expression is detectable in mouse NKT-cells (Verykokakis et al., 2013, GDS5602) a targeted analysis of TAAR1 presence and function in this unique cell type is needed. 6861 Mouse Positive Chang et al., 2007 GDS2762 40097861 Mouse Positive Luckey et al., 2006 GDS1695 18100861 Mouse Positive Kim et al., 2006 GDS1807 20253311 Mouse Below Cutoff Fleige et al., 2007 GDS2805 41122650 Mouse Below Cutoff Patke et al., 2006 GDS2408 31695061 Mouse Below Cutoff Sato et al., 2005 94508161 Mouse Positive Yang et al., 2011 GDS4434 92366461 Mouse Positive Trandem et al., 2011 GDS4217 90374190 Mouse Positive Lee et al., 2012 GDS4334 88072790 Mouse Positive Sharma et al., 2011 GDS4333 88031161 Mouse Positive Pomi et al., 2011 GDS4373 84767690 Mouse Positive Johnson et al., 2012 G T-cells are a lymphocytic subset of immune cells that are important in cell-mediated immunity. Stimulation with specific factors differentially activates T-cells to illicit the development of specific regulatory, effector, and helper functions. there is a lack of agreement and availability of literature exploring TAAR1 function in the immune system. t-cells expressing TAAR1 and TAAR2 treated with TAs in vitro showed increased secretion of IL-4, a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation of T- and B-cells. this effect was reportedly due to TA interaction with both TAAR1 and TAAR2. rhesus monkey B-cells express TAAR1 and TAAR2 as well as TAAR5,6, and 9 at lower levels. TAAR1-dependent PKA and PKC phosphorylation in immortalized rhesus monkeys. a new mechanism by which TAs directly alter immune cell function. TAAR1 expression in B-cells may vary based on maturation stage. it is interesting to note that TAAR1 transcripts are significantly higher in plasma B-cells than in more mature memory B-cells (two-tailed t-test, p 0.05). the role of TAAR1 in astrocytes was addressed by Cisneros and Ghorpade (2014a,b), who showed that TAAR1 was both present and functional in primary human astrocytes and signaled through cAMP. TAAR1 mRNA and protein was upregulated by both METH and HIV-1 exposure. TAAR1 is also expressed in the human astrocyte cell line U251 (Lin et al., 2015, GDS6010) and embryonic stem cell line H9-derived astrocytes (Lafaille et al., 2012, GDS4538) another microarray experiment by the same group assessed expression profiles in induced astrocytes deficient in the UNC-93B protein (GDS4669), which produces a phenotype unable to signal through the TAAR1 RNA expression was reduced relative to cells incubated with normal brain slices. this difference could not be accounted for by age or developmental stage. affymetrix microarray technology uses \u201cdetection calls\u201d as a method of determining whether a gene transcript is present. TAAR1 expression is detectable in the human microglial cell line HMO6 (Yoshino et al., 2011, GDS4151) and in mouse BV-2 microglia (Dirscherl et al., 2010, GDS3613). microglial cells are a distinct lineage of macrophage derived from the yolk sac that exists exclusively in the brain. ethanol treatment induced a 1.4-fold increase in TAAR1 expression in microglia relative to DMSO control. microglial TAAR1 signaling has yet to be directly studied, but considerable overlap exists between the immune activated state and TAAR1 expression. pathological changes in endogenous agonists for TAAR1 could underlie alterations in microglial functions. these pathways are intimately connected in a sensitive network of microenvironmental surveillance and homeostasis. some of the most critical functions are perturbed by METH. TAAR1 RNA is present in mouse forebrain astrocytes (Lau et al., 2012, GDS3944), normal human astrocytes (Grzmil et al., 2011, GDS4467), and epidermal growth factor-treated rat astrocytes (Liu et al., 2006, GDS2146). TAAR1 is also expressed in the human astrocyte cell line U251 (Lin e 288042 Human Positive Lafaille et al., 2012 GDS4669 101498241, 101498242 Human Positive Simpson et al., 2011 GDS4135 80120811 Human Positive Grzmil et al., 2011 GDS4467 93316011 Mouse Positive Liu et al., 2006 GDS2146 26366816 Rat Positive (Partial) Zhang et al., unpublished GDS2919 44030411 Human Below Cutoff 1 RNA expression was reduced relative to cells incubated with normal brain slices. this difference could not be accounted for by age or developmental stage. TAAR1 RNA was still measurable in other astrocytic samples. TAAR1 expression is detectable in the human microglial cell line HMO6 (Yoshino et al., 2011, GDS4151) and in mouse BV-2 microglia (Dirscherl et al., 2010, GDS3613). ethanol treatment induced a 1.4-fold increase in TAAR1 expression in HMO6 microglia. TAAR1 RNA is present in these neuroimmune cell types. aberrant microglial activation, signaling, and function may be due to monoamine excess. pathological changes in endogenous agonists for TAAR1 could underlie alterations in microglial functions. TAAR1 is widely expressed in tissues of immune organs. TAAR1 protein is highly expressed in both lymph nodes and tonsils. TAAR1 protein is also highly expressed in lymphoid tissue and glandular cells of the appendix as well as glandular adrenal cells. all TAARs were downregulated in the asymptomatic stage of HIV-1 infection. all TAARs except TAAR3 were upregulated in acute HIV-1 infection. TAAR1 expression appears to increase upon initial infection, decrease once the asymptomatic phase is reached. the majority of TAAR1 expression-level counts for all immune cell types tend to be low. this is likely because of a disproportionate amount of macrophage samples. a retrospective analysis of three microarray datasets retrieved from BioGPS representing 1,049 human cell samples revealed TAAR1 gene expression in various immune cells. a literature search for TAAR1 agonists in cancer revealed a small subset of manuscripts describing amphetamine as a tumor-promoter. recreational amphetamine use correlates with increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients with weekly or more frequent use of amphetamines were 1.75 times as likely to develop NHL vs. their control counterparts. t1AM is a derivative of thyroid hormone and has been shown to inhibit growth of cancerous cells in-vitro. IC50 values of T1AM were twice as high for control human foreskin fibroblast cells. TAAR1 activation is associated with increased cancer risk and enhanced malignancy. a gene query for TAAR1 in the online Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC, Forbes et al., 2017) revealed that TAAR1 is overexpressed in at least 19 cancer types and in 16% of esophageal cancers. a similar gene-specific query in the Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus (Li et al., 2016) revealed varying RNA expression levels across cancer types. TAAR1 RNA was present at the lowest levels in cancers of the brain, pancreas, prostate, adrenal gland, stomach and esophagus, sex organs, and B-cells of the blood. median TAAR1 RNA levels were noticeably higher in the pan-kidney cohort representing KICH + KIRC + KIRP [KIPAN, n = 1020], Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma [KIRC, n = 607], P TAAR1 RNA is most highly expressed in the pancreatic somatostatinoma cell line QGP-1, lung carcinoid tumor cell line UMC-11, and the lung adenocarcinoma cell line VMRC-LCD. another Array Express RNA-seq dataset of long poly adenylated RNA and long non-poly adenylated RNA from ENCODE cell lines. differential expression is statistically significant in pancreas, pituitary, prostate, urinary, and uterine cancers. RNAseq datasets representing cohorts from 36 cancer types were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the R package RTCGA.rnaseq. values for the TAAR1 gene transcript were extracted, log2 transformed, and plotted with ggplot2. the minimal non-zero value for RNA expression levels was set to 1 to facilitate log2 transformation. TAAR1 expression trends in overall survival cancer studies raises speculation of TAAR1 as a possible prognostic marker. the first manuscript to posit TAAR1 as a predictor of overall survival in cancer was published. TAAR1 expression group to events in the low TAAR1 expression group. all HR values were log-transformed to normalize values around zero. an HR value of 1 denotes that survival was not different between the high and low expression groups. an HR > 1 means that survival was greater in the low expression group. survival of stage IIB cancer that had spread from the pancreas to the lymph nodes is significantly higher (HR = 4.79, p = 0.025) vs. stage IIA cancer that lacks lymph node involvement. TAAR1 may play a role in lymphoid cancer progression or pathways. TAAR1-specific compounds could be efficacious therapeutics for infections and cancers, as well as valuable pharmacological tools for dissecting stimulant-induced changes and damage to immune function. the analysis shows that expression of TAAR1 is modulated in cancers, suggesting that TAAR1 serves a functional role in cancer survival. current identification of TAAR1 as a marker in numerous cancers, potentially functional and therapeutically targetable, provides a logical direction for future studies on the effects of drugs targeting TAAR1. the identification of TAAR1 across immune cells presents an avenue for exploring both the role of TAAR1 in normal immune function and its potential role as a mediator or modulator of immune dysregulation."}
