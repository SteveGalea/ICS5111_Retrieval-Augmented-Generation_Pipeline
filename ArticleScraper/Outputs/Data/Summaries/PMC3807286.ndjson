{"summary": "the nonstructural NS1 protein of influenza A viruses is an important virulence factor (1). NS1 counteracts the IFN-induced antiviral host defense (2, 3) the anti-IFN activity of NS1 affects IFN induction and the action of IFNs and ISGs (4). HK68(del7) has a single nucleotide exchange at position 717 of segment 8 installing a stop codon in NS1 after 230 amino acids. MDCK cells were infected with an MOI of 0.001 in the presence of 0.5 g/ml of trypsin. at the indicated time points, supernatants were harvested. NS1 and NP and cellular actin in whole-cell lysates were detected by Western blotting. we rescued the prototype virus of the 1968 pandemic encoding NS1 of 237 amino acids, A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (10), called here HK68(wt), from cDNA as described previously (11) mutant and wild-type viruses which were otherwise genetically identical grew to comparable titers in embryonated chicken eggs. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were infected with HK68(wt) or HK68(del7) both viruses caused a 27-fold increase in reporter gene expression in comparison to uninfected cells. the mutant virus behaved like the wild type and did not induce measurable IFN activity above background. sequence analysis did not detect mutations that might have arisen during passage. HK68(del7) predominated in only one out of 10 independent passage experiments. HK68(del7) predominated in only one out of 10 independent passage experiments. s prepared from material of one donor were seeded in a 24-well format. supernatants were collected from the apical surface after indicated time points, and virus titers were determined. error bars, standard errors of the means, were calculated from three independent experiments. cell culture is detectable solely in competition experiments. mice were infected intranasally with 5 104 PFU of either HK68(wt) or HK68(del7) in both cases. luciferase activity (Luc) (A) and virus titers (B) were determined in the lung homogenates. titers of HK68(wt) and HK68(del7) were determined after intranasal infection. NS1 of H3N2 strains is modified by and can interact with proteins involved in histone modification and transcriptional regulation. a possible effect of the C-terminal elongation of NS1 on the properties of this histone mimicry sequence was not evaluated. a slightly enhanced growth of wild-type HK68 in Mx1-positive mice might argue for a better control of the innate antiviral defense by the virus."}
