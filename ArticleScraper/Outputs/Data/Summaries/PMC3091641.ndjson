{"summary": "some of the most pathogenic viruses in humans are zoonotic, and have their origins in wildlife. the majority of these agents are zoonotic, and have their origins in wildlife. phylogenetic studies indicate that these viruses first evolved in bats. infection by each of these viruses appears to be asymptomatic or of greatly reduced pathology. the association of so many human-lethal viruses with bats may be partly attributable to the fact that the order Chiroptera is the second largest mammalian order, behind only Rodentia in total species. the information obtained through large-scale sequencing projects resides, for the most part, in partially- or unassembled genome sequences. our aims in this paper are to describe the method we have devised for the partial assembly of genome sequencing traces for the inference of gene families. most pathogenic viruses, including all of the viruses listed above, possess one or more genes that directly antagonize the type-I interferon response [16-19] bat whole-genome sequencing projects are in progress, but neither is complete. one project will provide coverage at a level that will not produce a reliable assembly. a large proportion of genes in eukaryotic genomes reside in families, including the genes that encode the type-I interferon. the method is conceptually straightforward, and is based on an information-theoretic model that accounts for both sequencing error and evolutionary divergence. we then seek those partial assemblies that make the total description length of the combined set of sequencing traces as small as possible. we first present the model and the algorithm we have developed to minimize the description length and thus infer the structure of the gene family. the project is based on samples from a single individual bat (personal communication) the result of incomplete coverage is the exacerbation of one of the shortcomings of whole-genome shotgun sequencing: the difficulty of resolving repetitive DNA segments. this difficulty is not limited to the assembly of highly repetitious intergenic regions, but to the inference of gene families as well. us and Pteropus vampyrus genome sequencing projects examine these genes in comparison with the orthologous families in humans and other mammals. we assume a set S of sequencing traces containing regions with similarity to some given gene or genes. this seed gene would be an ortholog of the genes one is attempting to infer. the criterion we will use for determining the final set of assemblies is the minimization of the total description length of S under the model in figure 1. for any sub-model for pairs of traces that involves mutations from the common ancestor, the description length must account for the information required to encode the mutation rate. the cost of encoding the mutation rate is log y. the posterior pmf on the ancestral state is obtained by specifying a model for the accumulation of mutations from to, and summing over the unobserved state. the posterior pmf for the latent true nucleotide state is (5) where k is the position in the assembly corresponding to i and j in traces 1 and 2 respectively. for progressive alignment, note that the posterior assembly pmf and the cost are composed from the individual sequential alignments. we first align traces 1 and 2 to obtain assembly 4 and then align trace 3 to assembly 4 to produce assembly 5 as shown in figure 2. each of these 15 assemblies maps unambiguously to one of the 13 known IFNA genes or the single whole pseudogene at an average error rate of 6.0 10-4 per base. in one case, a pair of assemblies mapping to a single genomic gene, IFNA17. the dinucleotide difference is less well supported, with just a single trace covering it in one assembly. all 13 IFNAs, 1 IFNA pseudogene, IFNW1 and 6 regions annotated as either IFNW-like or IFNW pseudogenes were mapped. one pair of assemblies was erroneously mapped to a single IFNA pseudogene. two genes encode polypeptides of length 190 2. one at 187 and two at 195 3. one at 170 No relevant hits to murine IFNZ were found in either chiropteran genome. species Hsa Mlu Pva Has ID 0.752 0.784 Mlu 0.655 ID 0.832 Pva 0.711 0.696 ID Phylogenetics The intact ORFs of the inferred sequences were aligned with the type-I interferons from humans and from the domestic pig, Sus scrofa. the phylogenetic tree relating these genes was inferred using maximum likelihood. the inferred sequences were used to design sequencing primers and make several clones from each of IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK. we obtained DNA sequences from 19 independent IFNB clones from two individual bats. one sequence is identical to the consensus of all 19 sequences. the four sequences are within 1, 2, 5 and 6 bases of the most similar inferred IFNA gene. for IFND, there are three multiply-represented sequences. two of these genes differ at 9 bases; the third, which represents a pseudogene, differ from the other two by more than 20 bases. cells treated with VSV had peak levels of IFNB appear by 8 hours. expression levels are relative to the housekeeping gene PPIA. error bars represent standard errors of the mean over biological duplicates. each sequencing trace results from direct templating from one of these genes. the differences between the two traces are attributable to sequencing error only. in the latter, the divergence of the underlying genes from their common ancestor provides an additional source of differences. the criterion we will use is the minimization of the total description length of S under the model in figure 1. quality score is q, we take the output to represent a posterior probability mass function (pmf) on the latent nucleotide state at that position, given by (1) where D represents the data conditioning the estimate, and (q) is defined by (2) It is not necessary to specify a likelihood function. we will also need the posterior pmf on the ancestral state, which is obtained by specifying a model for the accumulation of mutations from to. the logarithmic term is the cost of encoding the mutation rate that minimizes the alignment score. the argument is the number of nucleotides in the overlap of traces 1 and 2 in the optimal alignment. when c is positive, the indirect model is the more efficient; when c is negative, the direct model is more efficient. posterior probability mass function (pmf) on the latent nucleotide state at that position is given by (1) where D represents the data conditioning the estimate, and (q) is defined by (2). we will also need the posterior pmf on the ancestral state, which is obtained by specifying a model for the accumulation of mutations from to, and summing over the unobserved state. the logarithmic term is the cost of encoding the mutation rate that minimizes the alignment score. the argument is the number of nucleotides in the overlap of traces 1 and 2 in the optimal alignment. when c is positive, the indirect model is the more efficient;

IFNE and myotis lucifugus produced a single final assembly, which had an intact ORF. the sequencing traces returned in the search on IFNA2 produced multiple final assemblies that fall into three distinct families. our methods produced a single assembly in each bat (Additional File 1). all exons were clearly identifiable and all intronic splice signals were conserved. table 2 shows sequence similarity among the human and bat sequences. s of the inferred sequences were aligned with the type-I interferons from humans and from the domestic pig, Sus scrofa. the phylogenetic tree relating these genes was inferred using maximum likelihood. the features of the inferred phylogenetic tree are consistent with those found in previous investigations. IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK obtained DNA sequences from 19 independent IFNB clones from two individual bats. one sequence is identical to consensus of all 19 sequences, and is found in 7 of 12 clones from one bat. the overall frequency of pre-sequencing PCR error was 1.6 10-3 per base (17 errors in 10792 bases) for IFND, the greatest posterior probability occurs at g = 19 genes. for IFND, the greatest posterior probability occurs at g = 19 genes. for IFND, the greatest posterior probability occurs at g = 19 genes. gene expression time course by qRT-PCR in fresh P.vampyrus PBMCs stimulated in culture by the indicated compound. error bars represent standard errors of the mean over biological duplicates. the IFNA family is the largest IFN-I family in several mammals. it appears to be smaller in Pteropus and absent but for pseudogenes in Myotis. both bats have multiple members in the IFND family with five intact members. we found no evidence of IFNT or IFNZ in either bat. we found one member of each in P. vampyrus IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK. the directly cloned sequences validate much of the gene family inferences. the study of host defense and immunity in these unique creatures would benefit the pursuit of ecological and human health. the major obstacle in this undertaking is the lack of reagents that would make such investigations possible. primers derived from inferred interferon gene sequences were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA. the forward and reverse primers encoded restriction sites for NheI and XhoI respectively. PCR was performed on a P 2 Thermal Cycler from ThermoElectron Corporation (Waltham, MA) cells were incubated at 37' and 5% CO2 for the indicated times. cDNA synthesis was performed using qRT-PCR kit. independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment and time point. phylogenetic inference The set consisting of type-I interferon amino acid sequences from human (Homo sapiens), domestic pig (Sus scrofa), duckbill platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and the amino acid sequences corresponding to the Chiropteran genes inferred in this paper was submitted to multiple sequence alignment by CLUSTALW 2.0.10 [36] and ProbCons 1.12 [37] Maximum likelihood and animals were housed in captivity at the Lubee Bat Conservancy in Gainesville, Florida, USA. the bats were captured manually, anesthesia was mask-induced with 5% isoflurane in oxygen (3 L/min), and the bats were maintained with 2.5% isoflurane. Pteropus vampyrus IFNB, IFNK, IFND, and IFNA sequences have been submitted to Genbank (GU126493, HM63650, HM636501, and HM636502) Quantitative RT-PCR Whole anticoagulated blood was collected from the brachial vein. cells were treated as indicated with either poly(I:C)(Invivogen), LPS (Sigma), or VSV. quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an Eppendorf mastercycler ep realplex thermal cycler using SYBRGreenER qPCR Supermix. independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment and time point. cDNA synthesis was performed using the two-step qRT-PCR kit. independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment and time point. maximum likelihood and minimum evolution phylogenies were inferred with proml found in the PHYLIP 3.68 package [38] Maximum likelihood and minimum evolution phylogenies were inferred using fastme [39] based on the distance matrix calculated with protdist found in PHYLIP. in both cases, 1000 boot-strap replications were generated using seqboot and the consensus phylogeny was assembled with consense. bio file requires the BioEdit program, which is freely available at http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html. cloned sequences include only those found in at least two independent clones. no external funding was used. no funding source had any influence on the study design, on the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data."}
