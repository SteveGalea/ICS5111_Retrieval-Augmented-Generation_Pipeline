{"summary": "improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. it has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a major global health burden [1], and viruses cause a large proportion of ARTIs. the predictive value of vital signs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and X-ray findings for diagnosing pneumonia requiring antibiotics is low [7,8] the present study was designed to evaluate whether access to a multiplex RT-PCR method targeting thirteen viruses would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rates for ARTI in a primary care setting. participants were age 18 years and a diagnosis of community-acquired ARTI, defined as having a history of at least two of the following symptoms. recruitment was performed from Sunday through Thursday from 8 AM until 5 PM. nasal swabs and throat swab specimens were collected from each patient. results communicated through web-based case report form to a study nurse. serious adverse events were defined as death, life-threatening events, hospitalisation or events resulting or threatening to result in persistent or significant disability. the regional Ethical Review board approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. the target region for the hRV and EV assays was the conserved segment of the 5' untranslated region that allows amplification of all subtypes. the primers and probes used for IfB and PIV type 3 were developed by Dr Lars Nielsen, Copenhagen, Denmark. patients recruited at 12 outpatient units (eight primary healthcare centres and four departments of infectious diseases), and samples were collected from October 2006 through April 2009. randomisation and masking Patients were enrolled by the treating physician on the day of inclusion and stratified according to duration of symptoms. results communicated through web-based case report form to a study nurse at each site. additional diagnostic testing, including throat and sputum cultures, CRP and X-ray investigations, were left to the discretion of the treating physician and recorded in the case report form. each sample was amplified in six parallel reactions containing primers and probes. the modification of adenovirus was analysed in a separate reaction. this is particularly important for AdV, hRV and EV. statistical analysis On the basis of the nature of the primary outcome measure, patients with protocol violations and/or missing data were excluded from the primary analysis. the study was scheduled to include at least 200 patients in each group, allowing for a statistical power of 80% to demonstrate an estimated reduction in antibiotic prescription rate.
