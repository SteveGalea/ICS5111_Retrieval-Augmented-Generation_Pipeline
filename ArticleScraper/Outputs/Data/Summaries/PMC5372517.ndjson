{"summary": "lactoferrin (Lf) is a conserved iron-binding mammalian glycoprotein with antimicrobial activity. it is present in secretions that recover mucosal sites regarded as portals of entry and/or invasion of pathogenic agents. mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial action of Lf result from both direct (microbiostatic) and indirect (immunomodulatory) effects. ferric ions derived from the diet or from iron-loaded transferrin (holo-Tf) can bind two ferric ions derived from the diet or from iron-loaded transferrin (holo-Tf), each one associated with a synergistically bound carbonate ion (CO32) the two domains of each lobe fully closed over the bound metal ion. holo-Lf is conformationally more rigid and more resistant to denaturation and proteolysis than the apo-Lf. apo-Lf is generally more effective against bacteria than holo-Lf. mucosal inflammation carried out in a Caco-2 cells model and macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed that both Lf forms effectively inhibited the pro-inflammatory response. apo-Lf was more effective in downregulating inflammation, probably due to its ability to neutralize LPS, as well as to neutralize microbial-derived antigens, thereby potentially reducing their pro-inflammatory effect. the largest external source of Lf is milk consumption. hLf can be enzymatically cleaved by pepsin in the stomach and trypsin in the small intestine. in adults, about 60% of bLf resists proteolytic digestion mediated by pepsin. several Lfcins have been synthesized and experimented against microbes. synthetic LFcin17\u201330, lactoferrampin and a fusion peptide of both called LFchimera have been successfully assayed against multiresistant bacteria, and also against bacteria that typically form biofilms. human Lf has been cloned in different vectors and expressed as recombinant (r-hLf) overall in eukaryotic systems which can glycosylate it, such as yeasts and fungi. the best product is obtained from transgenic cows and plants [85,86,87] some inflammasomes regulate cell death in response to microbial and endogenous danger signals. some inflammasomes regulate cell death in response to microbial and endogenous danger signals. Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) serovar Typhimurium Gut inflammation, necrosis [99] bLf treatment of Caco-2 cell-line cultures infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli) HB101 pRI203 (invasive) IL-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells infected with E. coli HB101. bLf treatment of cultured cells infected with E. coli LF82. bLf treatment of rotavirus infection children IFN, IL-10 and rotavirus incidence in children whether fed or unfed with bLf. administration of bLf or synthetic LF chimera peptide to BALB/c mice infected with enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. LF33 peptide administration to mice treated with LPS and to RAW 264.7 cell-line cultures treated with LPS Limulus amoebocyte lysate coagulation, TNF secretion by RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS, TNF- levels correlated with protection to lethal LPS-induced septic shock. lymphocytic recall response towards BCG correlated with lung pathology. bLf administration to a murine model of lung injury by LPS Bronchioalveolar leukocytes, TNF-, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL-10, lung edema and inflammation [116] bLf administration to a murine model of influenza Viral load and IFN, IL-6 and IL-12 in the lungs [119] Other mucosal and systemic sites bLf effects on mammary hLf and peptide-hLf derivatives administration to mice infected with E. coli uropathogenic strain Bacterial load in the bladder and kidneys, leukocyte in urine, urinary IL-6 levels at 2 h and systemic IL-6 levels at 24 h post-infection [126] hLf expressing transgenic mice infected with congenic litter mates. physiologic inflammatory response orchestrated by innate and adaptive mechanisms mediated by intestinal epithelial cells and by a wide array of immunocompetent cells at lamina propria. inflammation has a double-edged sword role by either enabling or inhibiting cancer development and progression. bLf displays up- and down-modulatory effects on pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine profile. bacterial growth and gastric inflammation seemed to be enhanced by bLf or hLf administration. bLf as a single component failed to eradicate the H. pylori infection. but in combination with triple esomeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin therapy favored the resolution of infection. iron-free form of apo-Lf (holo-bLf) enclosed in nanocapsules showed antimicrobial activity and modulatory properties on the inflammation. the latter was evidenced by up- and down-modulation of cytokines involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. apo-bLf decreased levels of IL-8 elicited by non-invasive strain, and IL-8, IL-6 and TNF by E. coli invasive. bLf toward inflammatory mediators was iron-independent. constant high IL-8 levels provided protection by inducing recruitment of phagocytes to combat infection. bLf inhibited bacterial invasion and pro-inflammatory cytokine response of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8. bLf is regulated by the inflammation that determines the survival of intracellular pathogens by reducing the intracellular iron levels. bLf can up- and down-modulate the inflammatory response and iron availability resulting in the resolution of infection. in vitro assays indicated that bLf did not exhibit suppressive activity against rotavirus. assessment of rotavirus infection incidence in children, either treated or not with bLf, showed that bLf neither prevented the viral infection nor had an effect on the levels of IFN- or IL-10 as markers of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins. assays in suckling rats showed that administration of whey protein concentrate containing bLf favored the resolution of acute gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus infection. in some patients, hemolytic uremic syndrome characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia and kidney injury. fecal bacterial output and kidney colonization were found reduced, while LFchimera significantly decreased mortality rate. in vivo and in vitro assays have documented the role of r-hLf against gut-related infection by E. coli strain Ec5 causing meningitis in orogastrically infected neonatal rats. hamide immunosuppressed mice mimic immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. antisepsis action of bLf was associated with a rise of circulating leukocytes induced by the elicitation of IL-6 in the spleen and liver. studies in mice systemically infected with E. coli evidenced that bLf enhanced the killing activity and recruitment of neutrophils. models of intestinal and systemic-related endotoxemia induced by LPS from Gram-negative enterobacteria. they are intended to assess the impact of Lf at intestinal and systemic levels on inflammatory markers elicited by LPS that affect the gut barrier, bacterial translocation, diarrhea, tissue damage and endotoxic shock. pLf bioactive derivatives such as pLf peptide 20 (LFP20) have been proved to confer protection in mice against LPS apo-bLf showed stronger neutralizing effects than holo-bLf against the pro-inflammatory cytokine generation in response to LPS. iron content may determine the protective role of Lf toward the inflammation caused by gut endotoxemia and/or sepsis. bLf administered by intraperitoneal route in mice attenuated the LPS-induced diarrhea. hLf-derived LF33 peptide exhibited protective activity against lethal intravenous LPS challenge by decreasing circulating levels of TNF. bLf displayed prophylactic action against lethal shock occurring upon intravenous injection of LPS in germ-free piglets. protective activity against hypothermia has been described with hLf. bLf failed to confer protection against endotoxemia and E. coli bacteremia in C3H/HeCr mice due to its inability to ameliorate the elicitation of TNF- and IFN, and to prevent IL-6 decrease. hLf significantly down-modulated serum TNF, nitric oxide, IL-6 and IL-10. treatment with r-hLf has been analyzed in the same mice models of hepatitis. the protective effect of r-hLf was not found in mice pre-treated with gadolinium chloride that destroys Kupffer cells. this suggests that these cells are the source of TNF and the targets of r-hLf. bLf showed an anti-inflammatory response by driving the differentiation of LPS-treated monocytes toward dendritic cells with low capacity of differentiation and elicitation of Th1 response by counteracting the TLR4 mediated activation signals [167]. bLf, in the form of complex with LPS, enhanced cytokine response of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 via TLR4\u2013NF-B signal pathway. the human respiratory tract is responsible for the mobilization of millions of liters of gases throughout life. infections in the upper RT are very frequent in the population and represent a considerable cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. toferrin on the Infection-Associated Inflammatory Response in the Respiratory Tract All RT infections are accompanied with an inflammatory process. the inflammatory process is essential for the control of invasive infectious agents, but the development of an exacerbated or chronic inflammation results in alterations of the respiratory capacity. bLf admixed to the BCG vaccine, in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant or PBS, increased mice protection against a M. tuberculosis challenge compared with mice that received BCG alone [112]. bLf added to the vaccine also resulted in a clear reduction in lung pathology, concomitant with down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators TNF or IL-1. mycobacterial loads in the lung and spleen were not significantly reduced in the BCG-r-hLf group compared with controls treated with BCG alone. this was probably due to the notable immunomodulatory function of the granulocytic Lf used in this study, when compared with the Lf form from secretions, which is more microbicidal. fibrosis (CF) bronchial cells (IB3-1) infected with burkholderia cenocepacia. the opportunistic bacterium infects patients with CF forming biofilms. bLf decreased the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1, while augmented the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-11. 1 h before (prophylactic effect) or 1 h after (therapeutic effect) LPS challenge were associated with significant reduction of the total number of leukocytes in bronchioalveolar lavage samples, increased IL-10, decreased TNF concentrations and myeloperoxidase activity. these changes paralleled attenuation of lung edema and inflammatory infiltration, suggesting a protective role of bLf by avoiding the damage caused by the LPS- bLf and curcumin supplementation to children with recurrent viral RT infections resulted in immune modulation by modifying the lymphocyte population and cytokine responses that reduce the rate of infections. a recent study aimed to determine the effect of three months supplementation with bLf-fortified formula on respiratory tract infections and diarrhea in 260 Chinese weaned infants (4\u20136 months age) integrin complexed with CD18 (CR3) acts as receptor for the iC3b complement fragment. alternative approaches have also been tested to decrease the deleterious effect of inflammation on tissue integrity. combination of bLf and antibiotics was found to be effective to control the staphylococcal mastitis. in vitro assays tested full length bLf and bLf-derived peptides. the therapeutic effect of parental bLf relies on the N-terminal portion associated with its ability to up-modulate the killing action of PMN neutrophils by increasing the superoxide generation. findings suggest that in the murine model of candidiasis, the up-modulatory effect of bLf on parameters of inflammation provides protection to C. albicans infection. cin B diverted the death cell from necrosis to apoptosis. findings suggest a synergy between the antibacterial effect of iron-free human lactoferrin and the stimulating killer effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN on infected cells. hLf-transgenic mice showed the pivotal role of hLf in the elicitation of a Th1 profile of cytokines, which determined the resolution of systemic infection. polarization of the immune response to the Th1 profile was evidenced by up-modulation of TNF and IFN levels and down-modulation of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-10 in culture supernatants of spleen cells. in some infectious clinical conditions of the large intestine, inflammation has a double-edged sword role by either enabling or inhibiting cancer development and progression. bLf displays up- and down-modulatory effects on pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine profile. bLf promotes the development of Bifidobacterium, one of the major genera of bacteria used as probiotics. bacterial growth and gastric inflammation seemed to be enhanced by bLf or hLf administration. bLf as a single component failed to eradicate the H. pylori infection. but in combination with triple esomeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin therapy and with probiotics, favored the resolution of infection. iron-saturated bLf (holo-bLf) enclosed in nanocapsules displayed both antimicrobial activity and modulatory properties on the inflammation. the latter was evidenced by up- and down-modulation of cytokines involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. bLf inhibited an IL-8 increased response caused by E. coli invasive strain. the regulatory impact of bLf toward inflammatory response has been described in in vitro models of infection by adherent invasive E. coli strains with a presumable role in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease. bLf inhibited the bacterial invasion and the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 in epithelial monolayers and in cultures from colonic biopsies. anti-inflammatory [104] versus pro-inflammatory [105] role of bLf. in vitro assays indicated that bLf did not exhibit suppressive activity against rotavirus [142] bLf did not exhibit suppressive activity against rotavirus. infection incidence in children showed that bLf neither prevented the viral infection nor had an effect on the levels of IFN- or IL-10 as markers of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins. administration of whey protein concentrate containing bLf favored the resolution of acute gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus infection. this result suggests a synergic effect from the bulk rather than each single bioactive component that provided protection to enterovirus. uremic syndrome characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia and kidney injury. fecal bacterial output and kidney colonization were found reduced. fecal bacterial output and kidney colonization were found reduced. LFchimera significantly decreased mortality rate. antisepsis action of bLf was associated with a rise of circulating leukocytes induced by the elicitation of IL-6 in the spleen and liver. studies in mice systemically infected with E. coli evidenced that bLf enhanced the killing activity and recruitment of neutrophils. bLf may underlie its protective action to sepsis. either hLf or bLf, including derived Lfcins, have been evidenced in models of intestinal and systemic-related endotoxemia induced by LPS. these experimental models are intended to assess the impact of Lf at intestinal and systemic levels on inflammatory markers elicited by LPS that affect the gut barrier, bacterial translocation, diarrhea, tissue damage and endotoxic shock. in some cases, experimental assays with LPS administration encompass the use of apo-bLf showed stronger neutralizing effects than holo-bLf against the pro-inflammatory cytokine generation in response to LPS and thermally inactivated E. coli CM226 antigens. iron content may determine protective role of Lf toward inflammation caused by gut endotoxemia. hLf-derived LF33 peptide exhibited protective activity against lethal intravenous LPS challenge by decreasing circulating levels of TNF. bLf showed prophylactic action against lethal shock occurring upon intravenous injection of LPS in germ-free piglets. protective activity against hypothermia has been described with hLf in mice underwent LPS-induced hypothermia. bLf failed to confer protection against endotoxemia and E. coli bacteremia in C3H/HeCr mice due to its inability to ameliorate the elicitation of TNF- and IFN. hLf significantly down-modulated serum TNF, nitric oxide, IL-6 and IL-10, but no significant fluctuations were seen in the levels of IL-10. r-hLf provided protection against hepatitis development as determined by decrease in alanine transaminase activity as the marker of liver damage. protective effect of r-hLf was not found in mice pre-treated with gadolinium chloride that destroys Kupffer cells. bLf enhanced cytokine response of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 via TLR4\u2013NF-B signal pathway. bLf showed a dual role on the LPS-mediated response of pro-inflammatory cytokines. this includes the ability of Lf to control the expression of iron-regulating proteins. bLf is regarded as a natural compound able to inhibit the pathogens growth. it is also able to up- and down-modulate humoral and cellular components of immunity involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. inflammation has a double-edged sword role in maintaining the gut homeostasis and combating infections. vivo models of infection show that bLf displays up- and down-modulatory effects on pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine profile. bLf promotes the development of Bifidobacterium, one of the major genera of bacteria of the colon flora used as probiotics. this effect is believed to help maintain the gut homeostasis. anti-inflammatory activities of both r-hLf and native bLf have been tested in models of bacterial infection by Shigella flexneri in rabbits [98], and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in susceptible BALB/c mice [99], respectively. both treatments favored the resolution of infection and protected mice from tissue damage caused by the intestinal inflammation [98,99] apo-bLf as well as holo-bLf decreased levels of IL-8 elicited by non-invasive E. coli wild type strain, and IL-8, IL-6 and TNF by E. coli invasive. this strain is able to accomplish invasion but not intracellular multiplication within epithelial cells. bLf inhibited both bacterial invasion and survival, while in infected cells primed with IFN-, bLf increased IL-8 production. bLf inhibited both bacterial invasion and survival, while in infected cells primed with IFN-, bLf increased IL-8 production. both IL-4 and IL-6 are Th2 interleukins involved in the up-regulation of sIgA and IL-6. bLf administration led to anti-inflammatory response of mediators such as Th2 cytokines and IgA that collaborate in the protection against the parasite. however, in vitro assays indicated that bLf did not exhibit suppressive activity against rotavirus. in most cases, models mimic sepsis conditions found in human systemic infections by invasive enteropathogenic bacteria in immunocompetent hosts. the latter is a food borne pathogen causing mild diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. in infected mice that underwent both Lf and LFchimera treatments, fecal bacterial output and kidney colonization were found reduced. treatment with r-hLf decreased clinical sepsis illness and bacterial loads in the kidney and blood. in vitro assays in macrophage cultures showed levels of nitric oxide, TNF and NF-B expression were even higher following the addition of r-hLf. protective action of r-hLf resulted from an optimal activation of macrophages via pro-inflammatory cytokine elicitation to enhance their bacterial killing activity. clinical trials have confirmed the potential application of bLf to prevent nosocomial sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis of premature neonates. clinical trials have confirmed the potential application of bLf to prevent nosocomial sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis of premature neonates. bLf has been ascribed to its ability to act as a LPS-binding protein (LBP) protective action of hLf on the gut barrier function has also been described for hLf in in vitro cultures of caco-2 cells and jejune segments of mice underwent LPS-endotoxemia. iron status of bLf had no impact on parameters of the gut barrier function, as documented in in vitro cultures of caco-2 cells and jejune segments of mice. bLf administered by intraperitoneal route in mice attenuated the LPS-induced diarrhea by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators with powerful diarrheagenic activity. in the enterogenic endotoxemia model in rats, bLf decreased the endotoxic activity of LPS, as measured in plasma on a dose-dependent manner. bLf inhibited the interaction of LPS with CD14, an antigen surface marker expressed by mononuclear phagocytes. protective activity against hypothermia has been described with hLf in mice underwent LPS-endotoxemia. bLf failed to confer protection against endotoxemia and E. coli bacteremia in C3H/HeCr mice. hLf administered prior to the LPS challenge decreased serum levels of TNF, nitric oxide, IL-6 and IL-10. in the concurrent scheme, hLf significantly down-modulated serum TNF and nitric oxide, but no significant fluctuations were seen in the levels of IL-6 and IL-10. down-modulatory impact on LPS-mediated inflammation was found in assays of intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1). effect that resulted from its ability to inhibit MyD88/NF-B and MyD88/MAPK signaling pathways. hLf also displayed down-modulatory activity on LPS-associated cytokine response by blocking the binding of NF-B to the TNF promoter. a dual role on the LPS-mediated response of pro-inflammatory cytokines includes the ability of Lf to control the expression of iron-regulating proteins as found in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cultures. in these cells, Lf prevented the LPS-induced decreased of ferroportin by reducing the IL-6 levels. influenza virus, a common cause of seasonal flu, can simultaneously affect other parts of the RT, including the lower tract. infections of the lower RT are mainly caused by bacteria, but also by virus, fungi and even parasites. bronchitis, pneumonia and pulmonary abscesses are among the most prevalent infections in the lower RT. tuberculosis is the most studied in vivo model of microbial pulmonary infection. it is targeted by the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. the most widely used vaccine in the world has remained almost unchanged since 1921. r-hLf produced in yeast Pichia pastoris expression system with a glycosylation pattern similar to its natural neutrophil counterpart, was able to improve the efficacy of the BCG vaccine in protecting against the challenge with M. tuberculosis in aerosol. in this case, the mycobacterial loads in the lung and spleen were not significantly reduced in the BCG-r-hLf group compared with the controls treated with BCG alone. 0.5% bLf at Day 0 or 7 post-infection had lower Colony Forming Units (CFU) and lower inflammation in the lungs. increased numbers of IFN producing T CD4 and CD8 cells and IL-17 producing lymphocytes compared with animals vaccinated with BCG alone. bLf did not affect in vitro replication of M. tuberculosis but enhanced the killing of bacteria by macrophages in a nitric oxide dependent similar results were previously reported in bronchioalveolar lavage of P. aeruginosa infected CF patients. similar protective effect of bLf has been found in a murine model of lung injury induced by intraperitoneally administered LPS. oral or intraperitoneal administration of different doses (2 to 10 mg/animal/day) of bLF to mice from 48 h before until 96 h post-RSV infection did not have any effect on viral loads, pulmonary airflow resistance or obstruction, degree or type of pulmonary inflammation and serum T cellular responses. similar result was observed in a study carried out in mice treated by intranasal route with bLf on days 2\u20135, and evaluated on day 6 post-RSV infections in the upper RT are very frequent in the population. common cold, laryngitis, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, otitis and sinusitis are typically caused by virus, bacteria, and, at less extension, by fungi. influenza virus, a common cause of seasonal flu, can simultaneously affect other parts of the RT, including the lower tract. bLf is considered the second most important antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory peptide after lysozyme in the upper RT. a single subcutaneous immunization of mice with a mix of BCG and bLf emulsified with Freund\u2019s adjuvant resulted in decreased mycobacterial loads. bLf admixed to the BCG vaccine, in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant or PBS, increased mice protection against a M. tuberculosis challenge when compared with mice that received BCG alone. in addition, there was a significant reduction of lung bacterial load associated to increased production of IFN and IL-6 by splenocytes. the granulocytic Lf was not significantly reduced in the BCG-r-hLf group compared with controls treated with BCG alone. this was probably due to the notable immunomodulatory function of the granulocytic Lf used in this study. a r-hLf expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was also used in the mixture with the BCG vaccine. fibrosis (CF) bronchial cells (IB3-1) infected with burkholderia cenocepacia. the opportunistic bacterium infects patients with CF forming biofilms. bLf decreased the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1, while augmented the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-11. bLf has in vitro antiviral activity against the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [181], as well as an immunomodulatory effect reducing the release of IL-8 by Hep-2 cells infected with RSV [182], the administration of different doses (2 to 10 mg/animal/day) of bLF to mice from 48 h before until 96 h post-RSV infection did not have any effect on viral loads, pulmonary airflow resistance study aimed to determine the effect of three months supplementation with bLf-fortified formula on respiratory tract infections and diarrhea in 260 Chinese weaned infants (4\u20136 months age) study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis has established an association between genetic deficiency of Lf synthesis in the upper RT and increased susceptibility of certain individuals to bacterial colonization, biofilm development, and recalcitrant sinus disease. integrin complexed with CD18 acts as receptor for the iC3b complement fragment. alternative approaches have also been tested to decrease the deleterious effect of inflammation on tissue integrity. combination of bLf and antibiotics was found to be effective to control staphylococcal mastitis. in vitro assays tested full length bLf and bLf-derived peptides. the therapeutic effect of parental bLf relies on the N-terminal portion associated with its ability to up-modulate the killing action of PMN neutrophils by increasing the superoxide generation. findings suggest that in the murine model of candidiasis, the up-modulatory effect of bLf on parameters of inflammation provides protection to C. albicans infection. fcin B diverted the death cell from necrosis to apoptosis. findings suggest a synergy between the antibacterial effect of iron-free human lactoferrin and stimulating killer effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN on infected cells. hLf-transgenic mice showed the pivotal role of hLf in the elicitation of a Th1 profile of cytokines. polarization of the immune response to the Th1 profile in hLf-transgenic mice was evidenced by up-modulation of TNF and IFN levels and down-modulation of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-10 in culture supernatants of spleen cells. combination of bLf and antibiotics was found to be effective to control staphylococcal mastitis and to attenuate the mRNA expression of TNF via the inhibition of NF-B activation. this approach may contribute to decrease the effects of inflammation on tissue damage and reduce the antibiotic dosage for the eradication of staphylococcal infection by multiresistant strains. therapeutic effect of parental bLf relies on the N-terminal portion associated with its ability to up-modulate the killing action of PMN neutrophils by increasing the superoxide generation, protein kinase C, p38 MAPK activity, and the expression of p47phox. findings suggest that in the murine model of candidiasis, the up-modulatory effect of bLf on parameters of inflammation provides protection to C. albicans infection. pathogenic bacteria in macrophages favored anti-inflammatory conditions of cell death by apoptosis on these cells. hLf administered by peroral route decreased the bacterial load in the kidneys and urinary bladder as well as the inflammatory response. hLf inhibited the intracellular multiplication of the pathogen in both inactivated and IFN activated monocytes. polarization of the immune response to the Th1 profile in hLf-transgenic mice was evidenced by up-modulation of TNF and IFN levels and down-modulation of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-10 in culture supernatants of spleen cells. the biotechnological development of formulations of Lf as nanoparticles for potential clinical use may have application for the control of infections and inflammation."}
