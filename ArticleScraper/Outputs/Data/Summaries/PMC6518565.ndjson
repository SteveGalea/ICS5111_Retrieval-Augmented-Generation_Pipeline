{"summary": "rs12252, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFITM3, is a family of proteins that function as virus restriction factors [8\u201310], while IFITM3 is a cellular ongoing endosome- and lysosome-localised protein that protects cells from numerous viral infections [11, 12]. in recent years, animal studies have evaluated the relationship between rs12252 and the risk of influenza. 'flu OR influenza OR grippe' and 'iFITM OR interferon-induced transmembrane OR rs12252' only human studies were recruited. inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) animal studies; (2) abstracts, reviews or case reports; (3) containing incomplete genotype data. scores for high-quality articles were required to be 5 points at least in the NOS quality assessment. studies with scores higher than 6 were adopted in this meta-analysis. pooled ORs and CIs were used to evaluate association between rs12252 and influenza.

Forest plot of the subgroup classified by severity of influenza. study included 312 patients with severe influenza and 468 patients with mild influenza. significant difference was shown in CC vs. TT and CC vs. CT + TT models. early research [17] reported the influence of host genetic determinants for some diseases, such as influenza. several SNPs exist in the IFITM3 gene, including rs12252. many studies focused on influenza and rs12252. in the dominant model, the risk of illness of people with the CC or CT genotype was 1.38-fold higher than those with a TT genotype. the risk of influenza even increased 2.80-fold when comparing people with CC and TT genotypes in the homozygote model. we identified a new association by the degree of the infection. Neither of the meta-analyses of Yang et al. and Xuan et al. [15] found any association between rs12252 and patients with mild infection. heterogeneity was found in the severe subgroup, but not in the mild subgroup. we consider slight differences in the definition of the severe subgroup is one of the reasons for this. data of 1000 Genomes Project was extracted with the help of Huada Corporation. some challenges of our results still exist, which were mainly reflected in the limitations discussed in our paper."}
