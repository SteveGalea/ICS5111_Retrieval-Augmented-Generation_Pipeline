{"summary": "the first two large clinical trials assessing the cardiovascular safety of DPP4 inhibitors (EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53) suggest DPP4 inhibitors are safe from a cardiovascular perspective. both alogliptin and saxagliptin neither increase nor decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy and extracellular fluid volume expansion are also important pathogenic factors for the development of heart failure in individuals with diabetes. a large scale clinical trial in 2008 suggested intensive glycemic control increase, rather than decreased cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes. the use of rosiglitazone has been reported to cause diabetic macular edema-related vision lost in several cases. the use of rosiglitazone has been reported to cause diabetic macular edema-related vision lost in several cases [28,29] and it increases the risk of fractures in women [30]. all-cause mortality also increased in patients treated with 1st or 2nd generation sulphonylureas. metformin/sulfonylurea combination therapy increased risk of coronary heart disease by 3.27-fold compared with users of metformin monotherapy. chemokines/cytokines (eg. stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1], eotaxin, RANTES, GM-CSF, interleukin-3 [IL-3], etc) neuropeptides (eg. neuropeptide Y, peptide Y, eotaxin, RANTES, GM-CSF, interleukin-3 [IL-3], etc) are short peptide hormones secreted by the gut in both GLP-1(7-36) and GIP(1-42) are rapidly degraded by DPP4. resulting in very short half-lives (minutes long) in vivo. clinical trials on DPP4 inhibitors and heart failure DPP4 inhibitors have been increasingly used in clinic. both trials showed no increased risks in composite cardiovascular outcomes. the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial reported a 27% increase in hospitalization for heart failure, without excess heart failure related mortality. previous history of heart failure, eGFR60 ml/m, elevated BNP and albumin/creatinine ratio were the strongest predictors of heart failure hospitalization. further investigation is still needed to conclude if there is an excess heart failure risk in DPP4 inhibition therapy as there is a marginal effect. the weight of SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial is over 40% in this analysis. the risk ratios are given for DPP4 inhibitors versus placebo. the diamond indicates the overall risk and 95% CI for heart failure hospitalization. a recent study also showed DPP4 inhibitor MK-0626 impaired cardiac function accompanied by modest cardiac hypertrophy. genetic DPP4 deficiency improved cardiac function after transverse aortic constriction surgery. this suggests drug related unspecific effects may play a role in cardiac function."}
