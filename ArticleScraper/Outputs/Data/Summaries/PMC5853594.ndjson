{"summary": "nasopharyngeal swabs accurately predict the presence of viral infection. a signature of 3 mRNAs, CXCL10, IFIT2, and OASL, predicted respiratory virus detection with an accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9\u20131.0) RNAseq The raw reads of RNAseq experiments were trimmed off sequencing adaptors and low-quality regions by btrim [15]. the counts of reads for each gene were based on Ensembl annotation (release 70) and differential expression analysis was done by DEseq2 [17]. RT-qPCR testing and sample scoring (Study 1) or immunoassay testing (Study 2) were blinded to virology testing results until after the biomarkers were measured. nucleic acids were isolated from 0.2 mL of transport medium using the Nuclisens (Boom method) on the Easy Mag instrument. qPCR was performed using iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) RNA was isolated from cell pellets using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) qPCR was performed using iTAQ Universal SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories) RNAseq The raw reads of RNAseq experiments were trimmed off sequencing adaptors and low-quality regions by btrim. the counts of reads for each gene were based on Ensembl annotation (release 70) and differential expression analysis was done by DEseq2 [17], which calculated the adjusted P values. sample processing Study 1 included 68 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected in viral transport medium during 14 days between 12/2015 and 2/2016. samples were stored for a maximum of 8 hours at 4\u00b0C prior to centrifugation. pneumovirus (hMPV)a,b Influenza A and B (Flu A, B)a,b Parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 (PIV 1\u20133)a,b Respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV)a,b Rhinovirus (RV)a aSemiquantitative qPCR bDirect fluorescent antigen testing Coronavirus was adopted from Sultani et al, 2015. Chemokine levels were measured using the bio-Plex or Luminex instrument. samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged to remove cell debris. samples were de-identified and coded by the clinical laboratory. investigator responsible for reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) testing and sample scoring (Study 1) or immunoassay testing (Study 2) (E. F. F.) was blinded to virology testing results until after the biomarkers were measured and samples were scored. study 1 RNA was isolated from cell pellets using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed RNA using iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) qPCR was performed using iTAQ Universal SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories) al Pan-viral Biomarkers Using RIG-I Stimulation of human nasal epithelial cells can mount vigorous antiviral defense responses upon viral recognition. we stimulated HNEC in vitro with a small molecule ligand of RIG-I, a cytoplasmic receptor for viral RNA. this treatment stimulated RIG-I mimicking RNA virus infection. dots represent transcripts significantly different in control versus SLR14 stimulated HNEC (adjusted P-value of 0.05, log2 FoldChange >1 or 1). Labels highlight transcripts examined as potential nasopharyngeal biomarkers of viral respiratory infection. RT-qPCR for biomarkers on RNA isolated from 68 NP swabs sent to the YNHH lab for respiratory virus testing. test for 3 host mRNAs and correlation with respiratory virus detection in 68 nasopharyngeal swabs (Study 1). Plots show mRNA levels for 68 samples relative to the mRNA level in resting human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) each mRNA biomarker was scored positive if level was above the level observed in SLR14-stimulated HNEC. the YNHH virus panel does not include coronaviruses (CoV) we tested RNA from all patient samples using a previously described multiplex assay for 4 CoV genotypes. all 5 of the biomarker-positive, virus panel-negative samples were positive for CoV-OC43. the host response signature in Figure 2 is specific for viral infection. mRNAs triggered by RIG-I ligand encode chemokines. of the 8 chemokines tested, only CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 levels correlated with the presence of virus. patients were primarily older adults (72% of patients over the age of 50) and also included young children (15% of patients vs 6% in Study 1; Supplementary figures S1 and S3). CXCL10 and CXCL11 concentrations correlated highly with viral infection. nasopharyngeal swabs tested for respiratory viruses at Yale-New Haven hospital in 2016. NP swab CXCL10 or CXCL11 levels were measured using magnetic bead immunoassays. nucleic acids isolated from the viral transport medium were used to test for viruses not on the original test panel. Figure 5 shows the CXCL11 protein concentration in 219 samples. high CXCL11 levels correlated strongly with virus detection. low levels correlated with absence of virus, with intermediate levels indeterminate. possible rule in/rule out test for viral respiratory infection based on CXCL11 protein level. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs measured 219 samples (Study 1 plus Study 2). black bars represent presence of virus. transcriptional changes were dominated by interferon-stimulated genes. these include mRNAs associated with respiratory virus infection. transcripts that encode secreted proteins were of particular interest because they could potentially serve as biomarkers of viral infection. a transcriptional signature based on 3 of the identified mRNAs could predict viral infection in nasopharyngeal swabs. RT-qPCR was performed for -actin and 3 mRNAs associated with the antiviral response. most patients were older adults with multiple comorbidities. mRNA levels were normalized to -actin mRNA in each sample. mRNA levels were normalized to the level of -actin mRNA in each sample. bars in virus column indicate samples that tested positive for respiratory virus by qPCR. the overall diagnostic accuracy of the mRNA biomarker test was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9\u20131.0) and the positive predictive value was 100% (95% CI, 0.84\u20131.0). two of 68 samples represented false negatives (virus detected in the absence of ISG signature), including 1 rhinovirus (RV)+ and 1 human metapneumovirus (hMPV+ sample). levels of 8 chemokines identified in the RNAseq experiment. only CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 levels correlated with the presence of virus. levels of 8 chemokines were measured in viral transport medium associated with 65 NP swabs. samples were initially tested for the 9-virus panel and CoVs. results were compared to biomarker levels. three samples tested positive for parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV4). CXCL10 levels for 151 samples, sorted by CXCL11 level. asterisks indicate samples that tested positive for viruses not in the original test panel. C, Viruses detected in the 65/151 virus positive samples. dotted black lines indicate a low cutoff of 10 pg/mL. about 1/3 of the samples (35%) fall into the indeterminate zone. a high degree of correlation between CXCL10 and CXCL11 protein concentrations. Plot shows CXCL11 concentrations measured in 219 samples (Study 1 plus Study 2) sorted by CXCL11 level. black bars represent presence of virus. detected viruses that were not in the original test panel are indicated with an asterisk. we also observed CXCL11-low samples with viruses detected. asterisks indicate samples tested positive for viruses not in the original test panel. in the 65/151 virus positive samples, 43%) were positive for 10 distinct viruses. either CXCL11 or CXCL10 level was an excellent predictor of virus-positive and virus-negative status. the findings reveal that CXCL10 or CXCL11 concentration can predict infection with diverse viruses. about 1/3 of the samples (35%) fall into the indeterminate zone. a high degree of correlation between CXCL10 and CXCL11 protein concentrations. a high correlation of each biomarker with virus detection. mRNAs and proteins associated with NP swabs could be used to predict the detection of a respiratory virus in samples sent to our hospital laboratory for conventional virology testing. we chose possible biomarkers based on transcripts strongly induced by a virus-like stimulus in primary nasal epithelial cells. the consistent correlation of these chemokines with presence of diverse respiratory viruses in NP swabs suggests a particularly robust and conserved role for these chemokines in local antiviral defense of the upper respiratory tract. we defined an mRNA signature with very high diagnostic accuracy by combining the information from 3 biomarkers. in study 1, 16/68 (23.5%) of patients had COPD or asthma. 11 of these patients tested virus negative by the host mRNA biomarker signature. a pan-viral biomarker could be paired with an analogous biomarker of bacterial respiratory infection to distinguish among viral infection, bacterial infection, and viral/bacterial coinfection. biomarkers of the antiviral response are robustly detected using nasopharyngeal swabs, including protein biomarkers detected with immunoassay. even single biomarkers detected using this minimally invasive sample type offer high diagnostic accuracy. these results compel further study of using nasopharyngeal biomarkers for improving understanding of host/virus interactions. all authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest. conflicts that editors consider relevant to the content of the manuscript have been disclosed."}
