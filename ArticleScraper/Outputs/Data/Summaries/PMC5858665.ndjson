{"summary": "ZIKV is a single stranded RNA flavivirus that was first identified in the zika forest of Uganda in 1947 from Rhesus monkeys. some cases of human infection were reported in africa and Asia [2,3] before the first major outbreak on the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007 [4]. most of those who do have them have symptoms that are almost indistinguishable from those of other causes of undifferentiated systemic febrile illness, RT-PCR (RT-PCR) has been the most commonly used laboratory diagnostic assay for ZIKV infection worldwide. a number of specific real-time and conventional RT-PCR assays targeting the envelope (E), premembrane (prM), nonstructural proteins 1 (NS1), NS2B, NS3 and NS5 gene coding regions of the ZIKV genome have been described [18\u201324] all procedures and handling of mice were conducted under approved protocol. expression of fusion protein Nonstructural 1 (NS1) and Envelope (E) proteins were used as diagnostic target of anti-ZIKV. western blot was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and western blot. eluate was dialyzed using Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) for 24 hr by changing the buffer thrice. supernatants of hybridoma cell culture were screened by ELISA using the recombinant NS1 or E proteins (1 g/ml) as an antigen. selected hybridoma colonies were transferred into 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco/BRL). the final results were agreed upon by 3 investigators. the procedure does not require specific technic, can be tested easily and rapidly. ISA, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and PCR were performed on 30 Zika Positive Specimens provided by the hospital Gaffree e Guinle (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) a sample was considered positive if the optical density (OD) at 490 nm was 2-fold greater than that of a blank (PBS) sample. RNA extracts from serum samples were prepared for PCR using an ExiPrep Viral RNA Kit (Bioneer Co., Daejeon, Korea) RNA was extracted from 20 l of serum and eluted in 50 l of elution buffer. ethics statement This study was performed under the regulation of the IRB Committee of FEMPTEC and the IRB Committee of BahiaFarma (2016-01-02). all participants provided written informed consent, and no minors were involved in the study. the recombinant proteins (100 g/250 l) were mixed with equal volumes of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvants. after the third injection, the recombinant proteins (100 g/250 l) were injected intravenously without adjuvant. mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0 cell; ATCC #CRL 1581) were fused with spleen cells from the donor mice using 50% polyethylene glycol (Sigma Chemical Co.) supernatants of hybridoma cell culture were screened using the recombinant ZIKV NS1 or E proteins (1 g/ml) as an antigen. a 1-hr incubation was followed with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate at RT and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine solution was added after final washing. the final results were agreed upon by 3 investigators. the procedure does not require any specific technic, can be tested easily and rapidly, and showed clear results. real-time RT-PCR is the only method officially approved and used as the gold standard diagnostic method. cells were overlaid with 2 ml of DMEM with 2% FBS and 1.5% SeaPlaque agarose (Lonza) plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3\u20135 days. after this period, cells were washed twice with PBS, stained with 1% crystal violet for 30 min. cross reactions with DENV were evaluated using anti-Dengue Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PVD201) cross reactions with west Nile, yellow fever, and hepatitis C virus were also determined. DNA sequences for the E and NS1 proteins were obtained from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (http://viralzone.expasy.org) a comparison test using 30 Zika Mixed Titer Standards showed 100% identical results with the RDT kit against ELISA, PRNT and PCR. the diagnostic accuracy of Zika RDT as determined by sensitivity and specificity in. a field test was fairly high; with sensitivity and specificity for IgG at 99.0 and 99.3%, respectively. for IgM it was 96.7 and 98.7%, respectively. comparison of ZIKV IgG/IgM RDT results with 30 Zika positive sera Panel no. ELISA Total Positive Negative This kit Positive 297 2 299 Negative 3 298 301 Total 300 300 600 N= 450 (ZIKV IgM test) Negative samples were provided from the hospital Gaffree e Guinle (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) in 2016. the results showed that all cross reactions were identified at high titer (>8.9 s/CO) of DENV antibody positives. no cross-reaction with anti-west Nile virus, anti-yellow fever virus, anti-HCV were observed. all 4 serotypes of DENV are contained in the panels. DNA sequences for the E and NS1 proteins were obtained from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (http://viralzone.expasy.org) a comparison test using 30 Zika Mixed Titer Standards showed 100% identical results with the RDT kit against ELISA, PRNT and PCR. each mAb was conjugated with gold particles and reacted in the test line of the purified ZIKV. for IgM it was 96.7 and 98.7%, respectively. comparison of ZIKV IgG/IgM RDT results with 30 Zika positive sera Panel no. ELISA Total Positive Negative This kit Positive 297 2 299 Negative 3 298 301 Total 150 300 450 Positive samples were provided from the Hospital Gaffree e Guinle (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Ministry of Bahia (Brazil) in 2016. Cross reactions with DENV were also determined. all cross-reactions were identified at high titer (>8.9 s/CO) of DENV antibody positives. fortunately, no cross-reaction with anti-west Nile virus, anti-yellow fever virus, anti-HCV were observed. real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) on serum and urine has been commonly used during the first 2 weeks after onset of the illness. some had low sensitivity and incompatibility with currently circulating epidemic ZIKV strains belonging to the Asian/American lineage. serology tests should be followed when ZIKV RNA is negative on serum and urine from suspicious ZIKV infected patients. cross-reaction with the deNV represents 1 major disadvantage of the test. cross-reaction with deNV represents 1 major disadvantage of the test. the Zika RDT kit is very simple to use, rapid to assay, and very sensitive and highly specific. it would serve as a choice of method for point-of-care diagnosis and large scale surveys of ZIKV infection among people under clinical or field conditions worldwide in endemic areas."}
