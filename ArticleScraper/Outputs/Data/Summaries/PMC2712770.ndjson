{"summary": "a variety of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized as markers of viral invasion by immune effector cells. the integration of stimuli delivered by different viral PAMPs leads to inflammation and immune activation which, in turn, are key components of both pathogenesis and recovery from viral infection. transforming growth factor (TGF)- induces Foxp3 and promotes the generation of Treg cells. IL-6 inhibits the generation of Treg cells and induces the production of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. a virion can be envisioned as a concentration of different patterns recognized by the immune system. cDCs generated in vitro by differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes in presence of specific cytokines have been extensively used in many studies. cDCs of the second subset, pDCs, seem to be designed to be part of the first line of defense against viral and intracellular parasite replication. they express endosomal nucleic-acid sensing TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9, that once triggered, are mostly responsible for the release of type I I pDC response is inversely correlated with severity in viral diseases. cDCs are among the first cells encountered by most viruses. cDCs are among the first cells encountered by most viruses. a third possible outcome of virus\u2013DC interaction is that DCs will not digest and present all the viral particles they have picked up. the overall result of at least certain viral infections can thus be envisioned as a balance between the prevailing activity of DCs in triggering an immune response versus the ability of viruses to exploit DCs. DC-SIGN owes this property to binding of N-linked glycan substituents on viral spikes. it may function as a receptor alternative to the specific one or as a non-essential adhesion factor concentrating virions onto cells. more and more viruses are being found to bind DCs via DC-SIGN. CD207 is a membrane marker expressed solely by Langerhans cells. it is a pan-DC-specific surface marker, being expressed at high levels on DCs in the T cell areas of lymph nodes in their steady state. other surface molecules, like heparan sulfate and Fc and mannose receptors, contribute to the uptake of viruses by DCs. binding langerin may lead to lysosomal degradation and MHC class II loading. virions can bypass uptake by DC-SIGN. some viruses promote their own persistence. virulent RSV strains were shown to inhibit IFN- and IL-12p70 secretion by human DCs. in mice, RSV infection establishes a Th2 environment that leads to airway infiltration. at least some patients present with signs of Th2-mediated lung injury. vaccinia virus may induce cDC maturation, but interfere with antigen presentation. the outcome of viral disease is thought to be partly linked to the numbers of and balance between pDCs and cDCs, on the basis of observations made on patients. increased pDC numbers may be genetically determined in given hosts. patients with chronic hepatitis C exhibited reduced numbers of pDCs. a decrease in pDCs may occur as a result of retention in lymphoid organs. a number of viruses find suitable intracellular conditions to multiply in DCs. the ability to replicate in these cells certainly represents an advantage for them, since DCs are located at the sites of first encounter with the host. DV gives rise to a complex disease strictly dependent on immunopathology. herpesviruses are also capable of replication in DCs. they encode early gene products that immediately affect DC physiology. HSV-1 induces specific CD83 degradation as early as 6 hours after infection of human cDCs. lentiviral transfer from DCs to T cells originates from studying HIV-1 in in vitro-generated human cDCs. HIV sequestration by DC-SIGN helps HIV evade immune responses and spread to susceptible cells by a structure called the \"infectious synapse\" virions are actively transported along actin fibers and released outside the cells where they immediately find their receptors. this mechanism may be active also for other viruses, like HCV and SARS coronavirus. other viruses have been shown to undergo DC-mediated transmission to lymphocytes. the use of DCs in the therapy of HIV and SIV infection has been explored. in 2004, results were published from untreated HIV-infected patients vaccinated with autologous monocyte-derived DCs loaded with autologous inactivated HIV. this was the only trial that reported successful use of DCs in a human viral disease. cat infected by FIV is accepted as a good non-primate model for the study of AIDS. we investigated the vaccination of nave cats with autologous cDCs generated in vitro and loaded with whole inactivated FIV. this was the only agent able to induce the ability to prime alloreactivity of cat allogeneic T cells. many reports show that targeting DCs via different receptors improves the ability of different antigens to induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. it remains to be seen whether in vitro-derived DCs are efficient at inducing immunity but also at directing the immune response to specific types."}
