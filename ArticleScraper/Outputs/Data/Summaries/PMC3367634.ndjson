{"summary": "RNA was extracted from 10% to 20% of fecal suspensions in sterile Eagle minimal essential medium (EMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) samples were collected from finisher (10\u201324 weeks of age) pigs and gestating sows (>1 year of age) from 3 Ohio swine farms (10, 60, and 32 samples), 1 Ohio slaughterhouse (83 samples), 1 Michigan swine farm (61 samples), and 2 North Carolina swine farms RT-PCR products were purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) before cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO (T/A) or PCR XL cloning kit (Invitrogen) five clones of each sample were sequenced. DNA sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator Cycle and 3730 DNA Analyzer.

A second pig was inoculated with QW144 orally at 35 days of age and euthanized at PID 5. for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the recombinant baculovirus-expressed human NoV VLPs and rotavirus VP2 and VP6 (2/6)-VLPs (negative control) were CsCl-gradients purified. a total of 19 of 275 samples showed a potential positive band after agarose gel electrophoresis of the RT-PCR products of primer pair p290/110. after performing BLAST search, we identified 6 NoVs (QW48, Michigan farm A; QW101, QW125, and QW126, Ohio slaughterhouse) 2-ORF3 overlap (nt) VP2 (aa) 3 UTR (nt) Po/GII-11/Sw43 17 547 NA NA Po/GII-11/Sw918 17 547 NA NA NA Po/GII-11/QW48 17 547 1 253 57 Po/GII-18/QW101 20 557 1 275 48 Po/GII-18/QW125 20 557 1 275 48 Po/GII-19/QW170 17 the QW48 strain was most closely related to the porcine NoV prototype Sw43 strain (98% amino acid identity); the QW170 and QW218 strains shared the highest amino acid identities (81%) to porcine Sw43 and Sw918 strains. the QW101 and QW125 strains showed the highest amino acid identity to human GII-3/Mexico (71.4%), then to human GII-6/Baltimore (71.0%), porcine QW218 (71.0 phylogenetic tree of genogroup II noroviruses (NoVs) based on the complete capsid region. genogroups (G) and genotypes (numbers after G) are indicated. a potential recombination event occurred between QW170/218-like and Sw43-like strains. a potential recombination event occurred between QW170/218-like and Sw43-like strains. nucleotide positions of the 3 -end RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains of the capsid protein are indicated. sequence alignments of the RdRp-capsid junction region of noroviruses (NoVs) the RT-PCR\u2013detectable units of the rectal swab RNA increased from negative at PID 2, 103 at PID 3\u20134, and 104 at PID 5 (large intestinal contents) the 2 control pigs had no virus shedding or diarrhea. in western blot, the capsid proteins (59\u201360 kDa) of Toronto, MD145, HS66, and Florida strains were detected by pig antiserum LL616 but not the negative control serum. thus, 1-way antigenic cross-reactivity exists between human GII NoV antigens and a pig convalescent-phase antiserum against porcine GII NoVs. the QW126 shared 99% and 100% amino acid identities to the QW101 strain (GII-18) for a 169-bp segment in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region and a 363-bp segment in the capsid region. the QW101-like porcine noVs circulate among people with occupational exposure to pigs. if human noVs are genetically and antigenically related to human noVs, concerns exist about their zoonotic potential. no cell culture system or animal disease models are available for human NoVs. the infection of pigs with porcine NoVs may provide a new infection or disease model to study noV infections."}
