{"summary": "proteomics describes the study and characterization of complete set of proteins present in a cell, organ, or organism at a given time. the human genome harbors 26000\u201331000 protein encoding genes. total number of human protein products, including splice variants, has been estimated to be close to one million. large-scale western blot assays [23], multiple reaction monitoring assays [24] and label-free quantification of high mass resolution LC-MS data [25] are being explored for high throughput analysis. a wide range of proteomic approaches are available such as gel-based applications include one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the target residues for tryptic cleavage are absent in transmembrane helices. 2DE is unsuitable for the separation of integral membrane proteins. it is limited to detection of membrane-associated proteins and membrane proteins with a low hydrophobicity. maltoside, decaethylene glycol mono hexadecyl are proved most efficient membrane protein solubilizers [34]. it is important to quantify the majority of proteins in the membrane proteome of simple microorganisms. subcellular fractionation techniques are a common choice for preparing plasma membrane-enriched fractions including detergent-resistant membrane fractions. more than 10000 different proteins are present in the human serum. many of them are secreted or shed by cells during different physiology processes. serum proteomics has raised great expectations for the discovery of biomarkers to improve diagnosis or classification of a wide range of diseases. human-14 multiple affinity removal column depletes the top 14 abundant proteins from human serum, plasma, CSF, and other biological fluids. several types of mass spectrometry, in conjunction with various separation and analysis methods, are increasingly being adopted for proteomic measurements. 2DE and MALDI MS had applied to identify candidate biomarkers. this method identified 46 proteins in tumor bearing mice. this included disease regulated expression of orosomucoid-8, a-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein-A1, apolipoprotein-C3, glutathione peroxidase-3, plasma retinol-binding protein, and transthyretin. Membrane proteins constitute 30% of the typical proteome. the target residues for tryptic cleavage are absent in transmembrane helices. the target residues for tryptic cleavage (i.e., lysine and arginine) are absent. all three methods are effective and optimize the identification of membrane proteins. high pH favors the formation of membrane sheets, while proteinase K cleaves exposed hydrophilic domains of membrane proteins. more than 10000 different proteins are present in the human serum. many of them are secreted or shed by cells during different physiology or pathology processes. serum proteomics has raised great expectations for the discovery of biomarkers. heparin chromatography coupled with protein G appears to be an efficient and economical strategy to pretreat serum for serum proteomics. a polyclonal antibody-based system to rapidly deplete multiple high abundant proteins in serum, plasma, CSF, and other biological fluids. protein fingerprint can be determined and visualized by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. the advantages of this method are the low amount of sample necessary for analysis, its speed, and high throughput capability. many proteins found useful as biomarkers have been developed. two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) was developed two decades before the term proteomics was coined. the 2DE entails the separation of complex protein mixtures by molecular charge in the first dimension and by mass in the second dimension. 2DE analysis provides several types of information about the hundreds of proteins investigated simultaneously. the only technique that can be routinely applied for parallel quantitative expression profiling of complex protein mixtures such as whole cell and tissue lysates. posttranslational modifications that alter molecular weight and pI of a protein are reflected in a shift in location of the corresponding protein spot on the proteomic pattern. antibodies specific for posttranslational modifications can reveal spots on 2DE patterns containing proteins with these modifications. a large number of protein spots on 2DE patterns contain several proteins with a similar pI. increased separation distance 40 40 cm gels using CA-IEF [78] could increase the proteome coverage up to 5000 proteins. this technology, however, is biased against certain classes of proteins including low abundance and hydrophobic proteins. MALDI and ESI do not favor identification of hydrophobic peptides and basic peptides PTM information Bioinformatics Analysis of qualitative and quantitative proteomic data Functional analysis, data mining, and knowledge discovery from mass spectrometric data No integrated pipeline for processing and analysis. Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT) gel-free, or MS based, proteomics techniques are emerging as the methods of choice for quantitatively comparing proteins levels among biological proteomes. the technique has dramatically improved the reproducibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of quantification. different software programs were developed to analyze ICAT labeled MS data. ICAT is extremely helpful to detect peptides with low expression levels. major limitations of this technique include selective detection of proteins with high cysteine content. SILAC has emerged as a valuable proteomic technique [98] which becomes more common for cell types. SILAC-based quantitative method is powerful in comparative/differential proteomics. it has been widely used in analyzing protein posttranslational modification. a major drawback of SILAC is that it cannot be applied to tissue protein analysis directly. 18O labeling suffers from inhomogeneous 18O incorporation and inability to compare multiple samples within a single experiment. dual 18O labeling using a non-gel-based platform has been developed to overcome the major problems of existing proteolytic 18O labeling methods. an inherent drawback of the reported iTRAQ technology is due to the enzymatic digestion of proteins prior to labelling. this approach requires a powerful multidimensional fractionation method of peptides before MS identification. iTRAQ work flow. adapted from bill Simon and Toni Slabas, Proteomics Facility, School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Durham, UK. IPG-IEF for the separation of complex peptide mixtures has been applied to the analysis of plasma and amniotic fluid [123, 124] as well as to bacterial material [125]. the technique recovers the sample from the liquid phase and was demonstrated to be of great interest in shotgun proteomics [126]. pI range 3100 OFFGEL fractionators (Agilent tech) Separation of proteins or peptides according to their isoelectric points. low throughput, allowing 2-3 samples per week per instrument. antibodies are added to each well, with appropriate dilutions of each primary antibody so that expressed proteins are detected in a single condition. the scalability of the system depends on defining suitable combinations of primary antibodies, with up to 1000 antibodies in 200 lanes being used in the largest screens. two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) was developed two decades before the term proteomics was coined. the 2DE entails the separation of complex proteins by molecular charge in the first dimension and by mass in the second dimension. 2DE analysis provides several types of information about the hundreds of proteins investigated simultaneously. oelectro focusing (IEF), low copy number and insolubility of transmembrane proteins renders quantitative analysis of these peptides and polypeptides are very challenging. the major challenge for protein visualization in 2DE is the compatibility of sensitive protein staining methods with mass spectrometric analysis. quantitative expression profiling PTM information Proteins without lysine cannot be labeled Requires special equipment for visualization and fluorophores are very expensive Quantitative expression profiling High sensitivity Reduction of intergel variability ICAT Chemical isotope labeling for quantitative proteomics. phoresis (2D-DIGE) Proteins can also be fluorescently labelled with Cy2, Cy3 or Cy5 prior to 2DE [80]. the differentially labelled samples can be mixed and loaded together on one gel. the results are then analyzed by software such as De-Cyder. ICAT is the first quantitative proteomic method to be based solely on using MS [86, 87] each ICAT reagent consists of three essential groups: a thiol-reactive group, an isotope-coded light or heavy linker, and a biotin segment to facilitate peptide enrichment. SILAC is a valuable proteomic technique. it can be effectively expanded to compare the differential expression levels of tissue proteome at different pathological states. SILAC can be effectively expanded to compare the differential expression levels of tissue proteome at different pathological states, which allows to identify new candidate biomarkers. method was developed as an alternative quantitative approach for studying the proteome of mammalian tissues based on the application of SILAC. 16O/18O labeling does not require a specific MS platform nor does it depend on fragmentation spectra (MS2) for quantitative peptide measurements. in general, 18O labeling suffers from two potential drawbacks, inhomogeneous 18O incorporation and inability to compare multiple samples within a single experiment. the iTRAQ technology offers several advantages, including the ability to multiplex several samples, quantification, simplified analysis and increased analytical precision and accuracy. iTRAQ technology uses an NHS ester derivative to modify primary amino groups by linking a mass balance group (carbonyl group) and a reporter group (based on N-methylpiperazine) to proteolytic peptides. liquid-phase isoelectric focusing (IEF) is a prefractionation tool for 2D gel electrophoresis. for more consistent pI separation, the Zoom IEF fractionator [120] and multicompartment electrolyser [121] are being used to prefractionate the proteins. this allows at least 10000 to 15000 separate proteins to be analyzed. this separation is based on immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips. it permits to separate peptides and proteins according to their isoelectric point (pI) but is realized in solution [131]. the combined use of iTRAQ labeling and OFFGEL fractionation methods for the proteomic study of complex sample is also being considered. large-scale western blotting only identifies proteins for which antibodies are already available. a large well is used to separate the sample by PAGE and lanes are created on the membrane containing immobilized protein. multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) is used to analyse proteomes without gels. protein samples are subject to sequence-specific enzymatic digestion. the resultant peptide mixtures are separated by strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase (RP) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the adventage of protein-based microarrays allows the global observation of biochemical activities on an unprecedented scale. the microarray format provides a robust and convenient platform for the simultaneous analysis of thousands of individual protein samples. the principal challenges in protein array development are 3-fold: creation of a comprehensive expression clone library; (3) high-throughput protein production, including expression, isolation, and purification. protein chips differ from previously described methods. screening by 2DE or LC MS/MS can potentially detect any protein. protein chips can only provide data on set of proteins selected by investigator. multiplexed microarray immunoassays measure hundreds of known proteins in complex biological matrices. the development of high throughput, multiplex immunoassays is becoming a significant tool for quantitative proteomics studies, diagnostic discovery, and biomarker-assisted drug development. mass spectrometers consist of an ion source, the mass analyzer, and an ion detection system. in gel-based proteomics, the protein spots are excised from the gel and then digested with trypsin. the experimentally derived peptide masses are correlated with the peptide fingerprints of known proteins in the databases. s in tandem such as quadrupole-TOF and quadrupole-ion trap have combined the individual strengths of different types of mass analyzers. tandem mass spectrometers such as MALDI-TOF are used for only measurement of mass, while tandem mass spectrometers are used for amino acid sequence determination. reduced spectral congestion also allows for shorter experimental run times. short analysis time scales are key to measuring the large numbers of samples required to determine normal protein variability prior to realizing individual plasma profiling. an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer can accurately predict which fragment ions will produce the greatest signal in an SRM assay using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. targeted assays are the mass spectrometry equivalent of a Western blot [173] an advantage of using targeted mass spectrometry-based assay over traditional Western blot is that it does not rely on the creation of any immunoaffinity reagent. bioinformatics for proteomics The major bottlenecks in proteomics research are related to data analysis to create an environment where computer scientists and biologists can work closely together. processing and analysis of proteomics data is indeed a very complex multistep process. most approaches are matching and scoring large sets of experimental spectra with predicted masses of fragment ions of peptide sequences derived from a protein database. results are scored according to a scheme specific to each search engine that also depends on the database used for the search. the various search engines do not yield identical results as they are linked to one specific platform or were optimized for one instrument type. peptide identification is very computationally intensive and time-demanding. the association of identified peptides with their precursor proteins is a very critical and difficult step in shotgun proteomics strategies. protein Prophet database tool combines probabilities assigned to peptides identified by MS/MS to compute accurate probabilities for the proteins present [189]. 6.2. Data Repositories Importance of data repositories is to store, retrieve, and exchange data and results. lack of common standards and protocols has led to this situation. fractions containing mainly nuclei, heavy mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. golgi apparatus, endosomes and microsomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. each population of organelles is characterized by size, density, charge, and other properties. at least 200 different types of PTMs have been identified of which only a few are reversible and important for the regulation of biological processes. one of the most studied PTMs is protein phosphorylation, because it is vital for a large number of protein functions that are important to cellular processes. stoichiometry of phosphorylation is generally relatively low, because only a small fraction of the available intracellular pool of a protein is phosphorylated at any given time as a result of a stimulus. david frum: most analytical techniques used for studying protein phosphorylation have a limited dynamic range. he says phosphatases could dephosphorylate residues unless precautions are taken to inhibit their activity during preparation and purification steps of cell lysates chromatography (MOAC) and covalent methods are all capable of selectively enriching phosphopeptides. chromatography (MOAC), loading, rinsing, and elution solutions must be carefully selected to minimize nonspecific adsorption and maximize the detection of both monophosphorylated and multiphosphorylated species. in principle, two approaches can lead to an increase in protein identifications from unsequenced organisms. in the first approach, MS/MS data are searched against a protein database of an evolutionarily closely related organism. however, as a matter of principle of database-dependent searches, only proteins can be identified that contain at least one peptide with exactly the same sequence as the peptide from a protein in the database. subcellular fractionation consists of two major steps, disruption of the cellular organization (homogenization) and fractionation of the homogenate to separate the different populations of organelles. such a homogenate can then be resolved by differential centrifugation into several fractions containing mainly nuclei, heavy mitochondria, cytoskeletal networks, and plasma membrane. free flow electrophoresis (FFE) uses differences in electrophoretic mobility rather than density to separate cells or subcellular organelles [197] FFE has previously been used in separating endosomes from hamster ovary cells [198], plasma membrane from human platelets [199] and insulin transporting vesicles in liver cells. stoichiometry of phosphorylation is generally relatively low. only a small fraction of the available intracellular pool of a protein is phosphorylated at any given time. many of the signaling molecules, which are major targets of phosphorylation events, are present at low abundance. mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a reliable and sensitive method for the characterization of protein phosphorylation sites. a combination of techniques can reveal large numbers of phosphopeptides in complex samples, but comprehensive phosphoproteomics is still not possible. the application of proteomics and related technologies for the analysis of proteome is severely hampered by the lack of publicly available sequence information for most of the unsequenced organisms. despite the precision of the mass information yielded by the SELDI technique, a significant number of proteins were found to have no similarity to known peptides, an aforementioned weakness of proteomics studies in nonmodel organisms [216]. a mass value representing a terminal fragment containing only one of the two residues is a first requirement for ordering of a specific pair of adjacent amino acids. this limitation urged the need for bioinformatics approaches to interpret the proteomics data. iTRAQ reagent improves MALDI ionisation, especially for peptides containing lysine. the SILAC technology is beyond the capabilities of most groups. a systematic and efficient analysis of vast genomic and proteomic data sets is a major challenge for researchers today. the data processing and analysis bottleneck can be overcome through integration of the entire suite of tools into one linear pipeline. the good news is that all of the various proteomics strategies are in phases of very rapid technological development."}
