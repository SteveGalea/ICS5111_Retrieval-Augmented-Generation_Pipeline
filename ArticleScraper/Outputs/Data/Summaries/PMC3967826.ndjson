{"summary": "the patients with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infection were hospitalized in china between 25 February and 4 May 2013. the Chinese H5N1 cases represent all hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed H5N1 virus infection detected between 30 November 2003 and 8 February 2012. the ministry of science and technology of Vietnam approved the collection of clinical data from subjects with H5N1 virus infection. we estimated the relative risk of being hospitalized in subjects with and without risk factors. data on age- and sex-specific population prevalence were available for coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and obesity. the association between risk factors and the risk of death among hospitalized cases was assessed using logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios associated with each risk factor, adjusted for age and sex. we used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves for death and the hospitalized fatality risk. clinical and laboratory data were abstracted retrospectively from original medical records for cases of H7N9, H5N1 and pH1N1 virus infections. laboratory values were presented as medians with interquartile ranges and were dichotomized into normal or abnormal based on normal ranges for children and adults. sex-stratified population prevalence of chronic heart disease (CHD) was estimated from a study that recorded a prior history of hospitalization with coronary artery disease. we assumed that the age distribution of coronary artery disease is a valid proxy for the age distribution of CHD. 133 laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) cases have been officially recorded in mainland china. 123 requiring hospitalization for medical reasons were excluded. median age of subjects hospitalized with H7N9 was 63 years, compared to 26 years for H5N1 patients. 44 Male sex 87/123 (71%) 67/119 (56%).019 1937/3486 (56%).001 Any coexisting chronic medical conditions 42/105 (40%) 11/104 (11%).001 748/3485 (21%).001 Chronic heart disease 12/105 (11%) 1/102 (1%).001 147/3457 (4%).003 Chronic lung disease 10/105 (10%) 6/100 (6%).001 305/3397 (9%).849 Chronic renal disease 1/ compared with subjects without CHD, the presence of CHD was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 (relative risk [RR], 9.68; 95% CI, 5.24\u201317.9; Table 2). hypertension was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in any group, whereas a history of smoking was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization. chronic renal disease (assume zero prevalence aged 18 y) [13] 0.07 (.01\u2013.54) NC 0.47 (.37\u2013.58) Hypertension (assume zero prevalence aged 20 y) [10] 1.28 (.85\u20131.91) 0.45 (.10\u20131.99) 0.63 (.55\u2013.71) Smokingd [10] 0.38 (.24\u2013.60) 0.41 (.20\u2013.88) 0.74 (.66\u2013.84) Ob subjects with H7N9 virus infection were more likely to report a fever, a productive cough, and hemoptysis than those with H5N1 virus infection. symptoms 15/105 (14%) 17/53 (32%).01 Diarrhea 10/105 (10%) 6/50 (12%).01 Vomiting 4/105 (4%) 10/54 (19%).003 Nausea 6/105 (6%) 7/50 (14%).093 Central nervous system symptoms 4/105 (4%) 8/113 (7%) AST 53 (38\u201396.5) 100 (47\u2013233).076 40 (26.4\u201368.5).001 ALT 35.5 (24\u201364.5) 48.5 (29.5\u201399.5).001 24 (15.6\u201344).001 Serum creatinine 70.7 (58.3\u201385) 83 (54\u2013100).001 CK 195 (96\u2013562) 552 (126.5\u2013939.8).255 120 (62\u2013304).001 CRP 65 (25\u2013113) 51 (14.2\u2013 the risk of invasive ventilation and death among hospitalized cases by influenza A virus subtype are shown in Figure 1. the hospitalized case fatality risk was highest for H5N1 (55%; 95% CI, 47%\u201364%). H7N9 patients were hospitalized for a longer duration than either H5N1 (P.001) or pH1N1 patients (P.001). H7N9 patients were hospitalized for a longer duration than either H5N1 (P.001) or pH1N1 patients (P.001) (Figure 2). an age- and sex-matched case control study of 25 H7N9 cases has reported that the presence of a preexisting chronic medical condition (excluding hypertension) was associated with H7N9 disease (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.5\u201316.9). unrecognized CHD may have been present in some individuals. a low absolute lymphocyte count has been associated with poor outcomes in patients hospitalized with pH1N1, H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome. hematological and serum chemistry abnormalities suggest subjects hospitalized with H7N9 have a severe systemic illness. the comparisons we have made are limited by a lack of standardization of the methods of case ascertainment and inclusion, and of the recording of clinical and other data. however, we have tried to minimize these potential biases by restricting our analysis only to hospitalized subjects and to variables where data were available for a reasonable proportion of all cases.
