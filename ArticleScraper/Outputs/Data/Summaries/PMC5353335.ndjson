{"summary": "this study evaluated the incidence, predictors and prognosis of AKI associated with scrub typhus according to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease) criteria. 510 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus from January 2001 to November 2013 in Gyeongsang National University Hospital. Scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi. the disease is common in Southeast Asia, Australia, Japan, China and south Korea during the autumn season. haematuria or proteinuria, 10\u201320% incidence of scrub typhus, to severe complications, including acute renal failure,17\u201320 nephrotic syndrome21 and end-stage renal disease leading to long-term haemodialysis. the incidence of AKI in scrub typhus ranges from 8% to 40% according to the classification criteria used. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) formula. AKIN classification, later or modified version of \u2018RIFLE\u2019 classification, was reported in 2007. we compared the severity of AKI categorised using RIFLE in the CKD versus non-CKD group. the parametric Student's t-test was used to compare the means of samples with similar variances. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) formula. Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. we compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with CKD among those with scrub typhus in the CKD versus non-AKI groups. statistical analysis All measurements are the meanSD. 0.097 HTN 97 (19.0%) 48 (26.2%) 49 (15.0%) 0.002 ARB use 22 (4.3%) 15 (8.2%) 7 (2.1%) 0.002 Diuretics use 12 (2.4%) 6 (3.3%) 6 (1.8%) 0.364 DM 61 (12.0%) 32 (17.5%) 29 (8.9%) 0.005 CKD 27 (5.3%) 19 (10.4%) 8 (2.4%) 0.001 Time to hospital presentation after Symptoms onset 6.5 Haematuria 179 (36.5%) 80 (44.4%) 99 (31.8%) 0.005 Proteinuria 159 (32.3%) 73 (40.3%) 86 (27.7%) 0.005 Trace 100 (62.9%) 44 (60.3%) 56 (65.1%) 0.367 1+ 43 (27.0%) 20 (27.4%) 23 (26.7%) 2+ 11 (6.9%) 6 (8.2%) 5 (5.8%) 3+ 5 (3.1%) 3 (4.1%) 2 (2.3%) Tsuts 132 patients were in the \u2018risk\u2019 category (25.9%), 37 were in the \u2018injury\u2019 category (7.3%) and 14 were in the \u2018failure\u2019 category (2.7%). hypertension, DM and CKD were more frequent in the AKI group. the severity of AKI according to the RIFLE category was significantly greater in the patients with CKD compared with patients without CKD. time to hospital presentation after symptom onset, older age, presence of CKD and lower albumin and haemoglobin levels were significant predictors of AKI. 4 (50.0%) 0.675 WCC (x103/L) 8.394.20 8.164.75 8.952.64 0.664 Haemoglobin (g/dL) 11.011.51 10.741.44 11.681.56 0.144 CRP (mg/L) 83.1873.52 82.2480.14 85.1962.02 0.928 HbA1c (%) 7.991.79 7.871.90 8.80 0.664 Albumin (g/dL) 3.100 1.000 admission to ICU 3 (11.1%) 3 (15.8%) 0 (0.0%) 0.532 Death 4 (14.8%) 4 (21.1%) 0 (0.0%) 0.285 Ab, antibody; AKI, acute kidney injury; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; CK, creatine kinase; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CRP, C reactive protein; CRRT, continuous renal replacement therapy; diabetes mellitus; eGFR, estimated 0.000 2.226 (1.466 to 3.379) 0.001 2.095 (1.367 to 3.211) Haemoglobin (12 g/dL) 0.032 1.495 (1.035 to 2.160) 0.769 0.938 (0.613 to 1.437) time to hospital presentation after symptom onset (>7 day) 510 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus: 62, 108, 76 and 264 patients in the first, second, third and fourth quartiles. average patient age was 57.9 years and 48.0% were male. 97 patients had underlying hypertension, of whom 22 took an ACEi or ARB (4.3%) and 12 took diuretics (2.4%). 0.055 Haemoglobin (g/dL) 12.291.75 11.911.69 12.511.76 0.000 CRP (mg/L) 49.9154.27 56.1662.53 46.0448.17 0.072 HbA1c (%) 7.592.35 8.102.42 6.872.07 0.033 Albumin (g/dL) 3.450.60 3.190.61 3.600.55 0.001 AST (U/L) 112.740 admission to ICU 8 (1.57%) 8 (4.4%) 0 (0.0%) 0.001 Death 4 (0.8%) 4 (2.2%) 0 (0.0%) 0.016 Ab, antibody; AKI, acute kidney injury; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; CK, creatine kinase; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CRP, C reactive protein; CRRT, continuous renal replacement therapy; DM, diabetes mellitus; ESR, 24 (31.6 the serum albumin and haemoglobin levels were significantly lower in the AKI group (p=0.035 and p=0.000, respectively) the white cell count, C reactive protein, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels, and O. tsutsugamushi antibody titre did not differ between the two groups.
