{"summary": "Background Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been implicated in numerous epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease. it is associated with severe neurological complications and has caused significant mortalities in recent large-scale outbreaks. currently no effective vaccine or specific clinical therapy is available against EV71. EV71-infected children can develop neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, encephalitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, brainstem encephalitis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema or cardiopulmonary collapse. RNAi is a biological and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that has been employed in the development of promising therapeutic agents. chemically modified siRNAs can be optimized by incorporation of chemically modified RNA analogues against virus infection. the selection of appropriate siRNA targets is a critical initial step in the development of antiviral RNAi therapeutics. successful siRNA designs must be based on the conserved sequences of the viral genome. no effective siRNAs targeting the conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome have been reported. the application of unmodified 21 nt siRNAs and 2\u2032-modified (2\u2032-OMe and 2\u2032-F) siRNAs to target highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome for specific viral inhibition was investigated. nt double-stranded siRNAs containing 19-mer core sequences and 2d-TT at the 3\u2032 ends were designed to target the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome. the siRNA screening procedure was primarily based on a combination of RNA target accessibility prediction, siRNA duplex thermodynamic properties, and empirical design rules. the siRNA sequences are listed in Table 1. All siRNAs were synthesized by Genepharma Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China. the siRNA sequences are listed in the EV71 genome. RD cells were seeded in 24-well plates without antibiotics the day before transfection. the appropriate amount of siRNA was diluted in 50 l of Opti-MEM\u00ae. 1 l of lipofectamineTM 2000 was also diluted in 50 l of Opti-MEM. RD cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected with varying concentrations (25, 50, and 100 nM) of si-2FAM. as a control, one well was treated with 100 nM of si-2FAM without LipofectamineTM 2000. at 6 h post-transfection, cells were washed again with PBS. RD cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1.6 104 cells/well) and transfected with 100 nM of various siRNAs. at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection, a 20 l volume of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to each well. at the end of the transfection period (5 h), cells were RNA extraction was carried out using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit. eluted RNA was then eluted in 60 l of elution buffer. EV71 RNA levels were detected using the Mx3000P real-time PCR system. a series of 10-fold dilutions of the standard plasmid contained in the test kit were used to obtain the standard curve used in absolute quantitation of viral RNA. RD cells in 6-well plates infected with 0.01 MOI of EV71 were lysed with 150 l of CelLyticTM M Cell Lysis Reagent at 36 h post-in culture supernatants from each well were collected at 48 h post-infection and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. each well was covered with 3 ml of 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) after incubation, the plaque media was removed. gels were imaged using a 300 nm transilluminator and photographed with a black-and-white print film. RNAs were separated using 15% polyacrylamide-TBE under non-denaturing conditions and visualized by staining with gelRedTM Nucleic Acid Gel Stain. nucleotide identities between siRNA targeting sequences in HM003207.1 and corresponding sequences in other EV71 China strains available in GenBank were also considered. sequences were subjected to analysis by the BLAST algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) to exclude homology in both human and mouse genomes. si-1OMe 2\u2032-OMe-modified 5\u2032-CAGCAAACCACGAUCAAUATT-3\u2032(Anti-sense) si-1 F 2\u2032-F-modified 5\u2032-CAGAGCAAUUGUUUACCUATT-3\u2032(Anti-sense) si-2 F 2\u2032-F-modified 5\u2032-CAGAGCAAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAU the culture medium was changed to 500 l per well of Opti-MEM\u00ae. for each transfection, the appropriate amount of siRNA was diluted in 50 l of Opti-MEM\u00ae, while 1 l of LipofectamineTM 2000 was also diluted in 50 l of Opti-MEM\u00ae in another tube simultaneously. RD cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected with varying concentrations (25, 50, and 100 nM) of si-2FAM. the medium was changed at 5 h post-transfection. cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) RD cells were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected with 50 nM or 100 nM of various siRNAs. at the end of the transfection period (5 h), cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of EV71 for 1 h. real-time TaqMan RT-PCR Viral RNA extraction was performed. the kit contains a TaqMan probe (5'-FAM-TGCAAGGATGCTAGTGATATCCTGC-TAMRA-3' and a pair of primers (forward, 5'-GCAGCCCAAAAGAACTTCACT-3') that target the 2366\u20132455 nt region of the EV71 genome (Genbank accession no. HM003207.1). RD cells in 6-well plates infected with 0.01 MOI of EV71 were lysed with 150 l of CelLyticTM M Cell Lysis Reagent at 36 h post-infection. protein concentration was determined by BCA reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) plaque media was aspirated off, and each well was covered with 3 ml of 1% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in maintenance medium. plaques were stained with 1% crystal violet stain for half an hour at room temperature, and the plaques were counted. all data were expressed as means standard deviation (SD). differences with a P-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. results High transfection efficiency of siRNAs using LipofectamineTM 2000. the image marked \u2018si-2FAM only\u2019 indicates RD cells treated with 100 nM si-2FAM without LipofectamineTM 2000. the mock transfection control was carried out without the addition of si-2FAM. the data from the cells transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs showed no significant difference compared to the mock transfection control. unmodified and appropriate 2\u2032-modified siRNAs delayed cytopathic effects (CPE) and increased cell viability in EV71-infected RD cells. RD cells were transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs. the scrambled siRNA failed to protect against CPE in EV71-infected RD cells. these inhibitory effects lasted up to 72 h post-infection. at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-infection, viability percentages indicated that an obvious elevation of viability could be achieved in RD cells transfected with unmodified (si-1, si-2) or 2\u2032-modified (si-1 F, si-2OMe, si-2 F) siRNAs compared to mock transfection cells and scrambled siRNA transfected cells. however, 2\u2032-modified si-1OMe was not as effective as unmod t sequence of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR achieved more effective inhibition of replication. EV71 RNA transcript levels were reduced to 16.84 2.30% and 6.80 1.04% following the transfection of RD cells with 50 nM and 100 nM of si-2. the 2\u2032-modified si-2OMe and si-2 F were also fairly efficient in reducing EV71 RNA transcripts. real-time TaqMan RT-PCR analyses of EV71 RNA transcripts. RD cells were transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs. at 36 h post-infection, viral RNA was extracted from the RD cells. western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against EV71 VP1 structural protein was carried out. EV71 VP1 protein were significantly reduced upon treatment of RD cells with unmodified (si-1, si-2) and 2\u2032-modified (si-1, si-2OMe, or si-2 F) siRNAs exhibited a significantly greater reduction in the level of detectable VP1 protein compared with siRNAs (si-1 and si-1 F) targeting the RD cells were transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome. at 36 h post-infection, total proteins were extracted from the RD cells. 648\u2013666 nt sequence of EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR were more effective in reducing viral titers. RD cells transfected with si-1OMe showed only slight inhibition of virus yields. RD cells treated with increased concentrations of effective siRNAs showed decreased virus yields. compared with 50 nM of si-1, si-1OMe, si-1 F, si-2, si-2OMe and si-2 F respectively. serum stabilities of siRNAs Unmodified siRNAs are known to be unstable in serum [16]. fluorescein labeled si-2FAM could be seen localized in the cytoplasm of RD cells. no fluorescence was observed in the RD cells when 100 nM si-2FAM was transfected in the absence of LipofectamineTM 2000. the mock transfection control was carried out without the addition of si-2FAM. the proportions of fluorescein-labeled RD cells transfected with 25, 50, or 100 nM si-2FAM at 6 h post-transfection were shown using FACSAria flow cytometry. unmodified and appropriate 2\u2032-modified siRNAs delayed cytopathic effects (CPE) and increased cell viability in EV71-infected RD cells. mock transfection cells and scrambled siRNA transfected cells showed CPE, characterized by increased shrinkage and refraction. effects lasted up to 72 h post-infection. RD cells were transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs. the scrambled siRNA failed to protect against CPE in EV71-infected RD cells. at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-infection, viability percentages indicated that an obvious elevation of viability could be achieved in RD cells transfected with unmodified (si-1, si-2) or 2\u2032-modified (si-1 F, si-2OMe, si-2 F) siRNAs compared to mock transfection cells and scrambled siRNA transfected cells. however, 2\u2032-modified si-1OMe was not as effective as unmod EV71 RNA transcript levels were reduced to 16.84 2.30% and 6.80 1.04% following the transfection of RD cells with 50 nM and 100 nM of si-2. the 2\u2032-modified si-2OMe and si-2 F were also fairly efficient in reducing EV71 RNA transcripts. unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome were infected with 0.01 MOI of EV71. at 36 h post-infection, viral RNA was extracted from the RD cells. EV71 VP1 protein were significantly reduced upon treatment of RD cells with unmodified (si-1, si-2) and 2\u2032-modified (si-1, si-2OMe, or si-2 F) siRNAs targeting the 648\u2013666 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR exhibited a significantly greater reduction in the level of detectable VP1 protein compared with siRNAs (si-1 and si-1 F) targeting the 115\u2013133 n at 36 h post-infection, total proteins were extracted from RD cells. the internal loading control was detected using an anti-actin antibody. the VP1 protein level was set as 100%. RD cells treated with increased concentrations of effective siRNAs were found to have decreased virus yields. RD cells were transfected with unmodified and 2\u2032-modified siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genomic 5\u2032 UTR. compared with 50 nM of si-1, si-1OMe, si-1 F, si-2, si-2OMe and si-2 F respectively. serum stabilities of si-2, si-2OMe, and si-2 F were evaluated. a slight difference in stability was observed between si-2 F and si-2OMe. EV71 suppresses toll-like receptor 3-mediated type I interferon responses by down-regulation of toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing beta interferon (TRIF) traditional interferon therapy showed only weak anti-EV71 activities and is not suitable for the treatment of EV71 infections in vitro. RNA nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that a mixture of the siRNAs targeting the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome may have much broader antiviral effect on diverse EV71 strains. the most effective inhibition was observed for the siRNAs (si-2, si-2OMe, and si-1 F) targeting the 648\u2013666 nt sequence of the 5\u2032 UTR of the EV71 genome. target sequence located within the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR is a superiority with a reduced tendency to mutate. nucleotide sequence analyses suggest these siRNAs may have broader antiviral effects among EV71 China strains than the majority of previously reported siRNAs or shRNAs. both 2\u2032-OMe and 2\u2032-F modified siRNAs dramatically increased serum stability of the siRNAs in the present study. significant enhancements in serum stability of the siRNAs were observed in 10% FBS, 100% human serum, and 100% mouse serum compared with unmodified 21 nt siRNAs. cytotoxicity assays were used as a global indicator for monitoring adverse effects of unmodified and the 2\u2032-modified 21 nt siRNAs. neither the unmodified nor the 2\u2032-modified 21 nt siRNAs showed any significant cytotoxicity in contrast to the mock transfection control up to 72 h post-transfection. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
