{"summary": "HISTORY OF MERS-COV MERS-CoV was first identified as an infectious disease in humans in the Arabian Peninsula. in June 2012, the index case was hospitalized with pneumonia and acute renal injury. there have also been cases of MERS-CoV infection in other countries involving travelers who had visited the Arabian Peninsula. genetic sequencing has determined that the MERS-CoV is different from any other known human CoV. the origin of the MERS-CoV is not known, but an animal reservoir is suspected. human-to-human transmission has occurred in individuals living with an infected person and in HCPs caring for infected patients. there is no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings. early symptoms of human infection with MERS-CoV include fever, chills or rigors, cough, and shortness of breath. more frequently encountered symptoms include hemoptysis, sore throat, myalgias, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. lymphopenia has been reported in patients with MERS-CoV. other complete blood cell count abnormalities include leukopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia. the CDC recommends that multiple specimens from different sites in the lower respiratory system be collected at different times to increase the likelihood of detecting MERS-CoV. lower respiratory specimens are more sensitive than upper respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) death occurs a median of 14 days after presentation with a range of 5 to 36 days. as with other CoVs, there is no available specific therapy recommended for MERS-CoV. a vaccine is likely years away from approval. transmission MERS-CoV is thought to be of animal origin, but the mode of transmission from the animal reservoir is not known. the presence of case clusters suggests that human-to-human transmission also can occur. median incubation period is 5.2 days. early symptoms include fever, chills or rigors, cough, and shortness of breath. more frequent symptoms include hemoptysis, sore throat, myalgias. lymphopenia has been reported in patients infected with MERS-CoV. other complete blood cell count abnormalities include leukopenia, lymphocytosis. the CDC recommends that lower respiratory tract specimens be collected for testing with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the CDC has issued an emergency use authorization of the rRT-PCR assay developed by the CDC. 20,21,23,26,27,29 About 30% of people with MERS-CoV have died. death occurs a median of 14 days after presentation with a range of 5 to 36 days. the duration of viral shedding is not yet known. travel restrictions At this time the CDC has not recommended MERS-related travel restrictions."}
