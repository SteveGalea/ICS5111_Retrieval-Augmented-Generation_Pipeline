{"summary": "co-infection with 2 viruses as compared with 1 is associated with increased hospitalization in those with acute respiratory infections. a cohort of pediatric and adult participants enrolled with influenza-like illness during 2010\u20132014 in Mexico. the study was carried out at 6 public hospitals, 5 of them located in Mexico City and 1 in San Luis Potos. participants included 2 general hospitals (1 located in Mexico City and 1 in San Luis Potos), 2 tertiary care pediatric hospitals, and 2 tertiary care hospitals (1 of them dedicated to the treatment of respiratory disorders. the 19-pathogen PCR test can detect and differentiate 15 viruses (coronavirus [CoV] NL63, OC43, and 229E; HMPV, influenza A, influenza A H5N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus [HPIV] types 1\u20134; RSV types A and B; rhinovirus [RV]/enterovirus; and adenovirus [HAdV]) the 8 most frequent groups of viruses isolated were influenza (A, A (H1N1)pdm09, and B grouped as influenza), HMPV, HPIV, RSV, RV, HAdV, CoV, and HBoV. logistic regression models were used to compare hospitalization. nasopharyngeal swab for multiple PCR pathogen detection was obtained at enrollment. samples were stored in transport media at 4\u00b0C at each site. samples were sent daily to a central facility for testing. all samples were tested for HBoV detection with the use of virus-specific primers. hospitalization was defined as participants who were admitted to the hospital or remained in the emergency departments for at least 24 hours. 96.89% had a 28-day interview, 1619 had no virus isolated, and 32 had no sample. 85 excluded for other reasons such as bacterial infections (18 subjects), missing covariate information (11 subjects), and >2 viruses (56 subjects. 1514 (38.6) 453 (21.9) 1061 (57.2) Age 11 y 1411 (35.9) 386 (18.6) 1025 (55.2).001 11\u201359 y 2207 (56.2) 1577 (76.2) 630 (33.9) >60 y 308 (7.8) 107 (5.2) 201 (10.8) Days from symptom onset 0\u20131 2238 (57) 1623 (78.4) 615 (33.1).001 2\u20133 751 (19.1) 232 the bold categories show combinations that were not analyzed due to small numbers. there were 52 subjects with a combination of >3 viruses. participants with HAdV were more likely to be hospitalized compared with cases of influenza, CoV, and HAdV (as assessed by point estimates) participants with HBoV+RV were more likely to be hospitalized compared with cases of influenza, CoV, and, to lesser extent, HAdV (as assessed by point estimates) the confidence interval for all other combinations included 1, but the point estimates indicated that some combinations could be more severe than 1 of the single agents. each panel includes a comparison of each of 2 viruses with the co-infection with each of the viruses as single agents. participants with RV were more likely to be hospitalized as compared with cases of influenza and CoV (as assessed by point estimates) despite not statistically significant, CoV cases were less likely to be hospitalized as compared with those with influenza (Figure 1G). all odds ratios are adjusted for age, sex, days from onset of symptoms, and comorbidity. reports of the impact of multiple viral infections have been more frequent with the availability of PCR assays. V may be governing RV in the combination of these 2 viruses (panel J), RV governing CoV (panel K), influenza governing HBoV (panel N), and RV governing RSV (panel P) the confidence intervals around the combinations are often large and include 1, so these interpretations are not conclusive. the pattern observed in the point estimates is suggestive of the governing effect described above and warrant further study. participants with detection of only influenza virus were less likely to require hospitalization than participants in whom other viruses were detected. this was observed despite the fact that the study included the 2013\u20132014 winter season, when a severe wave of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was registered in Mexico. patients may be hospitalized for causes other than their respiratory illness, such as worsening of comorbidities, observation in high-risk participants, or social reasons. the presence of chronic underlying conditions is an important factor that is associated with risk of developing severe respiratory infections. study population included both pediatric and adult symptomatic participants. results suggest that having >1 virus detected by PCR does not increase severity of disease."}
