PP2A, GAPDH and UBC were identified as the top three RGs. ACT, GAPDH, PP2A and ACT were ranked fifth to eighth respectively. PP2A was a stable RG in virus-infected leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthiamiana48 and in virus-infected Arabidopsis thaliana43. PP2A was considered to be the least stable RG in common bean inoculated with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum50. the balance between SOD and APX or CAT activities in cells is crucial for determining the steady-state level of O2\u2013 and H2O2. the APX up-regulation during a relatively long time course of infection was observed upon the twig inoculation with the same high dose of PSA CRA-FRU 8.43. this is the first study in which a set of candidate RGs was analysed in terms of their expression stability in A. deliciosa leaves infected with PSA. two genes, GAPDH and PP2A, are the most stably expressed transcripts in all infected kiwifruit leaves. a low (1-2 103cfu/ml) and high (1-2 107cfu/ml) dose of bacterial inoculum, determined using spectrophotometry, were prepared in sterile, distilled water. to avoid wounding, the inoculation occurred by gently spraying the suspensions on the abaxial surface of fully expanded, healthy, young leaves. single-stranded cDNA synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using iScriptTM Select cDNA Synthesis Kit and oligo(dT)20 primers. selected genes belong to different functional and abundance classes. APX, CAT and SOD were selected as genes of interest. quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a CFX Connect Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) to analyse the specific expression of each reference/target gene. cDNA was amplified in 96-well plates using the SsoAdvancedTM SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 15 ng of cDNA and 300 nM specific sense and anti-sense primers in a final volume of 20 l for each the optimal number of RGs required for normalization was determined by pairwise variation Vn/Vn + 1 (0.15 recommended threshold) NormFinder calculates the expression stability value (SV) for each gene. only genes with a high r value and a low SD are combined into bestKeeper index (BKI) value using the geometric mean of their Cq values. bacterial strain was originally isolated from A. chinensis leaf spot. plant material, P. syringae pv. actinidiae inoculations and CRA-FRU 8.43 were used in this study. leaves were collected after one day post-inoculation and at intervals of three days for 13 days, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 \u00b0C until RNA isolation. each biological replicate was obtained by pooling three leaves from different plants harvested at random. APX, CAT and CAT were selected as genes of interest. amplification efficiency was determined using a pool representing all cDNA samples. cDNA was amplified in 96-well plates using the SsoAdvancedTM SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) each run was completed with a melting curve analysis to confirm specificity of amplification and lack of primer dimers. the stability of candidate RGs for several comparison groups was analysed with the following four applets: geNorm27, NormFinder28, BestKeeper29 and the deltaCt method30. only genes with a high r value and a low SD are combined into bestKeeper index (BKI) value using the geometric mean of their Cq values. the RG with the highest coefficient of correlation with the BKI is considered to be the most stable. edward et al."}
