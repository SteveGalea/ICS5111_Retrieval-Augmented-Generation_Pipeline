{"summary": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of any age, but infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100%. accumulating data have revealed the genetic diversity and complex change tendencies of PEDV strains circulating in a global context. a total of 165 intestinal tissues samples were obtained from the diseased piglets of 41 PEDV-positive farms in 18 provinces or municipalities of China in 2015. the 41 farms were selected as PEDV-positive using the colloidal gold immunochromatographic rapid test strip for PEDV. the PEDV infection status of all 165 intestinal samples was further confirmed using the conventional RT-PCR method which targets the ORF3 gene. 3' and PEDVS1-R: 5' AATACTCATACTAAAGTTGGTGG 3' were designed to amplify the sequence between nucleotide 20609 and 23004 of the PEDV genome. the alignment revealed a 2396 bp fragment (partial nsp13 gene +S1 gene) covering the S1 gene. the primer positioning was determined according to the complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CV777. the pAPN receptor-binding region (aa 490\u2013615) of PEDV S1 protein was analyzed. recombination analysis of the 29 identified S1 genes was carried out using the RDP4 software. nucleotide sequences of the ORF3 and S1 genes were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database. 22 were 2011 strains (Genbank accession no. JQ239429-JQ239436/JQ282909/JQ979287-JQ979290/JX188454/JX188455/JX524137/KC242898-KC242912/KF384500/KP399629); and 19 were 2014 strains (Genbank accession no. KM242131/KP399601-KP399609/ a total of 165 intestinal tissues samples were obtained from the diseased piglets of 41 PEDV-positive farms in 18 provinces or municipalities of China in 2015. the diseased piglets exhibited the clinical manifestations of acute diarrhea and vomiting. the antibiotic therapy was not effective for the diseased animals. the PCR amplification of the ORF3 gene was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions. one positive sample from each farm was selected for sequencing of the ORF3 gene. PCR products were amplified using 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 51\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the reaction was carried out by using an automated GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) a total of 29 S1 genes, corresponding to the previously sequenced ORF3 genes, were obtained. phylogenetic trees were built using the p-distance model and 1000 bootstrap replicates. nucleotide divergence of all selected S genes to the S gene of selected Chinese PEDV strains were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database. data sets were analyzed using a two-tailed, paired Student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel 2007 software. the nucleotide divergence (%) of each group is presented as \"average value standard deviation\" the same letters (one or more) represent no significant difference (P>0.05) among six groups. the 29 identified S1 genes indicated nucleotide homologies of 96.6%\u2013100% and amino acid homologies of 95.2%\u201399.5% respectively. nucleotide and amino acid homologies of 92.0%\u201392.7% and 89.5%\u201391.3% respectively, were observed between the 29 identifed PEDV strains and the prototypical CV777 strain. oning/NECA KU641640 \u2014 1/1 5 HeB/CC/2015 Jul-2015 Chicheng/Hebei/NCA KU641641 \u2014 1/1 6 GD/MM/2015 Aug-2015 Maoming/Guangdong/SCA KU641642 KU710225 7/9 7 HLJ/QQHR/2015 Sept-2015 Qiqihar/Heilongjiang/NECA KU641643 KU7 HuB/YC/2015 Dec-2015 Yichang/Hubei/CCA KU641655 KU710235 1/3 20 LN/DL/2015 Dec-2015 Dalian/Liaoning/NECA KU641656 KU710236 3/3 21 AH/HF/2015 Dec-2015 Hefei/Anhui/ECA KU641657 KU710237 1/1 22 JX/2015/1221 Dec-2015. nt 98.2%\u2013100% 96.6%\u2013100% aa 97.8%\u201399.6% 95.2%\u201399.5% compared with PEDV.
