{"summary": "a 36-year-old woman had been complaining of a mild, intermittent cough without fever for approximately 10 days. the cough, similar to one she had during her previous pregnancy, did not impair her ability to function. she stayed at the same hotel and on the same floor as a physician from southern china. she was prescribed chlorpheniramine and acetaminophen. fetal ultrasound performed on march 3 showed a live intrauterine fetus of approximately 21 weeks gestational age and complete placenta previa. despite antibiotic therapy, over the next 3 days, the patient became increasingly dyspneic; rales and decreased breath sounds developed. the patient was placed in airborne isolation. serum, whole blood, nasopharyngeal and rectal swab specimens collected 12 and 29 days after illness onset were tested at the centers for disease control and prevention. serum, whole blood, nasopharyngeal and rectal swab specimens from the mother, postdelivery placenta, cord blood, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. cSerologic analysis included enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence assay. dPostdelivery placenta also underwent immunohistochemical staining; there was no IHC evidence of SARS-CoV. the infant was delivered by cesarean section with contact, droplet, and airborne precautions in place. it is not clear if such precautions were necessary. other patients have demonstrated viral shedding in feces (14,15) and peritoneal fluid (16), suggesting that SARS-CoV infection during pregnancy results in passive immunity."}
