IR radiation emitted from biological tissues is detected and used to calculate temperature distributions. these calculations often account for radiation received from other sources such as the ambient and the emission of surroundings reflected by the object. only a fraction of the radiant energy emitted by a blackbody at the same temperature can be approximated by the max of a graybody. the spectral regions of greatest radiation intensity extend from mid-wavelength IR (MWIR, 2.5\u20137 m) to long-wavelength IR (LWIR, 7\u201315 m) infrared (IR) thermography medical applications IR thermography is a non-contact and noninvasive imaging approach. it has been studied for use in cancer imaging [1\u20137], ischemic monitoring and vascular disease [8, 9], wound assessment [10], corneal temperature measurement [11\u201313], diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases [14], fever screening [15\u201326], etc. IRTs and non-contact IR thermometers (NCITs) are the only currently viable temperature measurement approaches for mass screening of infectious disease pandemics. IRTs enable nearly real-time estimation of body temperature by detecting IR emissions, which may result in more prompt quarantine of infectious individuals. the purpose of this study is to evaluate, optimize and demonstrate the utility of a battery of test methods for standardized, objective and quantitative assessment of IRT performance. IR radiation emitted from biological tissues is detected and used to calculate temperature distributions. this can be described by a term known as spectral radiance (Lb) an object emits only a fraction of the radiant energy emitted by a blackbody at the same temperature. the emissivity of the object is constant and independent of, the object is a graybody and its radiant energy can be expressed by the Stefan-Boltzmann formula. IRTs for clinical use often operate in MWIR or LWIR ranges. this includes stability and drift, uniformity of the workable target plane, minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) and radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy. the laboratory space chosen for IRT performance evaluation should be checked to ensure that no source of IR radiation surrounds the experimental setup. a hand-held weather meter, WM (Kestrel 4500NV, Weather Republic LLC, Downingtown, PA) was used to measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity. b Field of view is reported in horizontal (H) and vertical (V) directions. BB-1 (SR-33N-4, CI Systems Inc., Simi Valley, CA) and BB-2 (SR-800R-4D, CI Systems Inc.) the blackbodies had the same emitter size of 44 inch2. both blackbodies were claimed to be traceable to the NIST ITS-90 thermocouples database. b Uniformity values were for a 1\u00b0C step from ambient temperature at 80% of the central area. some blackbodies have emissivity around 0.99, but usually operate at temperature higher than 50\u00b0C. to ensure accurate temperature estimate, recorded thermograms were compensated for non-ideal blackbody emissivity, g, (e.g., non-zero reflectivity) an assumption of atm = 1.0 was implemented. the measuring distance, relative humidity and ambient temperature can affect atm. the working distance between the blackbodies and the IRTs was d = 0.8 m. a larger size (15\u201320%) is acceptable if it can be experimentally proven that the ETRS doesn\u2019t adversely affect the measurement. a cloth backdrop with low reflectivity was used to minimize reflected IR radiation from the surroundings. a computer with controlling software is considered part of an IRT. a region of each frame within the BB-2 aperture was extracted for calculations. then the mean temperature value within the extracted region, Mframe, was calculated for each frame. the standard requires that three times SD8h \u2013 the confidence interval of the observations that is greater than 99%\u2013should be less than 0.1\u00b0C. the calibration interval for ST-1 and ST-2 can be considered as one year. a one-year measurement should be performed to accomplish a thorough drift analysis for the systems. stability and drift values of IRT-1 and IRT-2 were also measured. a thermal image of BB-2 was captured by the ST. a single image pixel value was recorded from a single image pixel value. the uniformity value of an ST should be less than 0.2\u00b0C. a larger uniformity value indicates worse uniformity. s methods are all based on the largest intensity difference between pixels. the standard uncertainty of uniformity (uU) should be used to calculate the radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy (Eq 8) it is difficult to translate the uniformity results based on the IEC-29-pixels and modified-29-pixels methods to uU values. the 4-bar target was mounted in front of the extended surface of BB-2 so the BB-2 surface can be seen through the etched bars. the aspect ratio of each bar was 1:7. the differential temperature (T) between the etched bars and the conjugate bars was adjusted using the BB-2 controller. MRTD values were measured at five target temperatures between 31\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C. direction of the bars can also affect temperature sensitivity and spatial resolution due to the combination of the data transfer architecture and the pixel design. background intensity was measured from a 2020 pixels square region of the target plate away from the bars. a contrast threshold at which the bars are considered resolvable could be estimated from the corresponding T. 2.3.4. the values of uMRTD and uETRS were based on the manufacturer specifications (Table 2). the values of |TST TCS should comply with Eq 6 at every CS temperature point (clause 201.101.2.2). 2.1. standard specifications The following is a summary of the terms and conditions described in the IEC 80601-2-59 standard [30] relevant to the performance evaluation test methods addressed in this paper. IRT-1 (A325sc, FLIR Systems Inc., Nashua, NH) and IRT-2 (8640 P-series, Infrared Cameras Inc., Beaumont, TX) nominal IRT specifications are listed in Table 1. the IRTs were attached to a stable platform and images were acquired with manufacturer-provided software. BB-1 (SR-33N-4, CI Systems Inc., Simi Valley, CA) and BB-2 (SR-800R-4D, CI Systems Inc.) all data in Table 2 were claimed by the manufacturer without independent calibration except for the total system uncertainty values that were calculated based on the claimed data. the standard [30] recommends use of a CS with emissivity 0.998 (annex BB). the nominal emissivity of BB-1 and BB-2 was 0.980.01. IR emission of an object can be expressed as [40]: E t o t a l = g a t m T 4 + (1 g) denotes the object\u2019s reflectivity. reflected temperature could be measured based on the \u201creflector\u201d method specified in a standard [45] the blackbodies were positioned in front of the IRTs, 1.5 m above the floor. the working distance between the blackbodies and the IRTs was d = 0.8 m. for normal fever screening, the working distance should ensure thermograms with minimum dimensions of 240180 pixels for the subject\u2019s face. the main devices used in this study include IRT-1, IRT-2, BB-1, BB-2, and WM. a screening thermograph (ST) usually includes an IRT and a blackbody as an ETRS (BB-1 in this case) for temperature offset compensation. the standard requires that three times SD8h \u2013 the confidence interval of the observations that is greater than 99% \u2013should be less than 0.1\u00b0C. the value of uS is used to calculate the standard uncertainty of the ST (Eq 8) and should be less than 0.03\u00b0C. stability and drift values of IRT-1 and IRT-2 were also measured. both stability (3SD8h) and drift (M8h,max\u2014M8h,min) values should be less than 0.1\u00b0C, and the combined stability and drift less than 0.2\u00b0C (clause 201.101.4) the IEC-29-pixels method is time consuming and vulnerable to artifacts associated with the uniformity and repeated repositioning of BB-2. a modified-29-pixels method was performed by placing the extended area BB-2 close to the IRT lens so that the blackbody aperture can cover the entire FOV of the IRT. we call the method based on the SD of all pixels as the all-pixels-SD method. the effects of IRT focal length, BB-2 focus state and BB-2 temperature on the uniformity results were also studied. IRTs were focused on the target, located in the center of the WTP. images were captured and viewed on a monitor with proper brightness and contrast. the resolution of the monitor should be high enough so that the MRTD is only affected by the input thermal images. MRTD values were measured with the 4-bar target in both vertical and horizontal directions. the aforementioned MRTD test method is subjective, and thus susceptible to reader variability which is not ideal for standardization. the CS temperature was measured five times (clause 201.101.2.2) at each of the 11 set points (TCS) in increments of 1\u00b0C across the range of 30\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. the minimum number of set points can be 5 (clause 201.101.2.2) the CS (BB-2 set at 37\u00b0C) was placed in the WTP of the ST-1 (and ST-2) and totally 1,920 consecutive frames were captured for 8 hours with time steps of 15 seconds. a region of each frame within the BB-2 aperture was extracted for calculations. the mean and standard deviation (SD8) of the 1,920 Mframe values for 8 hours of measurement (M8h and SD8h) were calculated. we define ud as (M8h,max\u2014M8h,min) based on the worst-case scenario. the calibration interval for ST-1 and ST-2 can also be considered as one year. a one-year measurement should be performed to accomplish a thorough drift analysis for the systems. uniformity was maintained at 37\u00b0C and at the 0.8 m working distance from the imager lens. BB-2 temperature was recorded from a single image pixel value. uniformity of the WTP was then calculated from the maximum difference between the 29 measured values. the IEC-29-pixels, modified-29-pixels and all-pixels methods are all based on the largest intensity difference between pixels. it is difficult to translate the uniformity results based on the IEC-29-pixels and modified-29-pixels methods to uU values. MRTD compliance was checked based on the ASTM E1213-14 standard [50]. the MRTD test target was an aluminum plate with high-emissivity coating. the 4-bar target was mounted in front of the extended surface of BB-2. MRTD values were measured at five target temperatures between 31\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C (with 2\u00b0C increments) the direction of the bars can also affect spatial resolution due to the combination of the data transfer architecture and the pixel design. ra s t = | I e t c h e d + I c o n j 100 %, (5) where Ietched and Iconj are the mean intensities of the etched bars and the conjugate bars after background intensity subtraction. MRTD values could be estimated from the corresponding T. 2.3.4. the values of uD, uS, and uU were measured with the test methods in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. the value of uMRTD was calculated based on the method in Section 3.3. the values of uCS and uETRS were based on the manufacturer specifications. values over an 8 hours period (SD8h, i.e., the standard uncertainty of stability uS) for IRT-1 and IRT-2 were 0.10\u00b0C and 0.27\u00b0C, respectively. the stability values of 3SD8h were 0.06\u00b0C for ST-1 and ST-2. -1 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 ST-2 0.08 0.08 0.08 0.08 0.09 0.09 3.2. uniformity results with the IEC-29-pixels and modified-29-pixels methods should be close if the same focal length is used. two dominant spatial non-uniformities were recognized in IRT-1 at both focal lengths. the first is a vertical striping pattern likely generated during digitization or other post-processing procedures. the second is a vignetting artifact (intensity reduction near the corners), likely caused by the lens. Fig 4a shows that the requirement of at least 29 random pixels in the standard does not guarantee a reliable uniformity value. Fig 4a shows that the requirement of at least 29 random pixels in the standard [30] does not guarantee a reliable uniformity value. IRT-1 failed to satisfy the IEC requirement regardless of the test method used. the uniformity values of IRT-2 across its WTP are around 0.2\u00b0C. the all-pixels method is a more comprehensive way of uniformity evaluation. it considers the entire pixels of the system and is as fast as the modified-29-pixels approach. however, the uniformity value based on the all-pixels method is much larger than other methods. s-SD method to evaluate the uniformity and set the uniformity criterion as SD of 0.05\u00b0C. the values at 0.2 cycles/mrad were 50% and 70% higher than the values at 0.04 cycles/mrad for IRT-1 and IRT-2, respectively. small error bars were measured to be 12% for IRT-1 (13% and 11% with the bars in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively) and 9% for IRT-2 (8% and 10% with the bars in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively). the MRTD uncertainty should be the average of uMRTD_V and uMRTD_H. the MRTD uncertainty should be the average of uMRTD_V and uMRTD_H. values of uCS, uETRS, uD, uS, uU, and uMRTD are the same within this temperature range. for complete evaluation of a device, these parameters should be measured at no less than 5 CS temperature points. error bars from three repeated measurements are much smaller than the symbols and therefore not visible. the values of uS and uD were provided by the blackbody manufacturer. the values of uU were based on the methods and definitions in Section 2.3.1. the values of uU were based on the methods and definitions in Section 2.3.2. the main differences between ST-1 and ST-2 are the uniformity and offset error. the uU values for ST-1 and ST-2 are 0.11 \u00b0C and 0.05 \u00b0C respectively. the CS uncertainty value can significantly affect offset errors. stability and drift values were calculated based on one-hour continuous temperature recordings with time interval of 15 seconds. a slower sampling rate of one frame per 300 seconds might be sufficient for stability and drift evaluation. the modified-29-pixels method is less burdensome and more robust to artifacts associated with the uniformity than the IEC-29-pixels approach. the uniformity results with the IEC-29-pixels and modified-29-pixels methods should be close if the same focal length is used. a dark circle when the camera focused at 0.05 m is seen in the center of the image, likely a narcissus effect due to IRT-2 optics. a vignetting artifact, especially when the camera focused at the working distance, is also apparent in the image. the uniformity within the FOV (the \u201cIRT-2, FOV\u201d curve) is worse than the selected WTP (the \u201cIRT-2\u201d curve) the smaller error bars in Fig 4b than those in Fig 4a indicate a better repeatability of the SD measure than the maximum difference measure. fixed pattern noise can be removed with the help of a dark frame or offset and gain for each pixel (for photon response noise) larger number of frames for averaging may lead to a higher level of uniformity for a static object. motion artifact is negligible in standardized fever screening where subjects are asked to remain at a given distance from the imager. IRT-2 has uniformity values of 0.2\u00b0C based on the modified-29-pixels method. it is reasonable to mirror the IEC uniformity criterion of 0.2\u00b0C to a criterion of approximate 0.05\u00b0C based on the all-pixels-SD method. if we assume the intensity values of the pixels have a normal distribution, then the SD of the pixel intensity values can be directly calculated as 0.05\u00b0C. MRTD values were bounded between 0.03\u00b0C to 0.06\u00b0C. the conjugate bars were at ambient temperature and positioned in the vertical direction at 0.8 m. results of the MRTD experiment indicated that IRT thermal sensitivity is less affected by the target absolute temperature ranging from 31 to 39 \u00b0C. IRT-1 showed higher MRTD values than IRT-2 for vertical bars. this is in part due to the vertical striping noise seen in IRT-1. this makes it more challenging for observers to visually resolve low contrast vertical bars. if we define the minimum visible contrast as 10% [57], MRTD values could be estimated from the corresponding T directly without using observers. the 4-bar target (conjugate bars) maintained at 35\u00b0C and positioned in the horizontal direction at distance of 0.35m. the largest value of |TST TCS| over the range of 34\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C was applied in Eq 6. the values of uS and uD were based on the methods and definitions in Section 2.3.1. uETRS and uCS are from Table 2. The offset errors only show the largest value within temperature range of 34\u201339 \u00b0C. the main differences between ST-1 and ST-2 are the uniformity and offset error. a summary of our findings for the essential performance of the two ST systems under study are listed in Table 5. Essential performance requirements for STs. Stability Clause 201.101.4: Stability should be 0.1\u00b0C ST-1 and ST-2 satisfied the requirement. none of the IRTs alone met the requirement. MRTD should be 0.1\u00b0C ST-1 and ST-2 satisfied the requirements. an alternative contrast-based objective method was proposed. none of the IRTs alone met the accuracy requirement. IR cameras failed the uniformity tests following the standard (IEC-29-pixels method) both IR cameras failed the uniformity tests following the standard (IEC-29-pixels method) this method should be further evaluated to see whether the threshold value is too tight. the uniformity criterion of 0.2 \u00b0C based on the IEC-29-pixels method can be mirrored to a criterion of 0.05 \u00b0C based on the all-pixels-SD method. a criterion around 0.1\u00b0C based on the all-pixels-SD method might be considered. the orientation and spatial frequency of 4-bar targets affects MRTD results. the highest spatial frequency a camera can detect is limited by both the optics (cutoff frequency) and the sensor pixel size (Nyquist frequency) the lowest spatial frequency for uMRTD measurement should be a frequency that below which the MRTD value will not change. we only evaluated the standard uncertainty values of different characteristics once for a given device under a specific environment. this is beyond the scope of this paper. the authors have declared that no competing interests exist. sthetic and respiratory equipment / SC3(Lung ventilators and related equipment) / JWG8(Clinical thermometer) / PT9(Screening thermographs), including Prof. Francis Ring from the university of south Wales, Dave Osborn from Philips, and Charles Gibson from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology."}
