{"summary": "the restrictive nature of the blood\u2013brain barrier limits the ability of proteins and immune cells to enter into the brain and spinal cord in response to a virus infection. neuronal function requires that infected neurons be allowed to survive, necessitating noncytolytic immune mechanisms to control virus infection. IFN- is an important product of natural killer (NK) cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. it exerts its antiviral effects by inducing IFN-stimulated genes. but also by modulating the immune response to infection. cAP-7 cells were grown at 33 \u00b0C with 7% CO2 in DMEM + 10% FBS + 2 mM l-glutamine + 100 U/mL penicillin + 100 g/mL streptomycin. the TE strain of SINV was grown and assayed by plaque

virus clearance from neurons, immature cycling cAP-7 olfactory neuronal cells and mature bipolar differentiated dAP-7 cells. both cAP-7 and dAP-7 cells supported virus replication. dAP-7 cells infected with SINV were either left untreated or treated with 500 U/mL IFN- at 2 HPI. dAP-7 cells treated with IFN- at 2 HPI had significantly decreased virus production compared to untreated cells at 24, 32, and 48 HPI. treatment with IFN- at 24 HPI did not alter virus production. production of the nonstructural nsp3 protein and structural capsid protein reached high levels by 24 HPI. production of the structural glycoproteins (along with precursor to E2, pE2) was evident by 48 HPI. the results show that IFN- can decrease the production of SINV by neurons. '-5'oligoadenylate/RNaseL system encodes viperin, a protein that interferes with assembly and release of many viruses. all of these genes required IFN- for induction and generally were not induced by SINV infection alone. p 0.05, p 0.01, p 0.0001, Mock, IFN- Txt 2 HPI vs. SINV, IFN- Txt 2 HPI, all by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. flow cytometry was used to characterize cells from the CLNs, the draining lymph nodes of the brain, and the brains of WT mice. CD4+ T cells (black circle and solid line), CD8+ T cells (gray square and solid line) and NK cells (white circle and black dashed line) producing IFN- were examined as both the percentage of live cells (A,B) and absolute cell counts (C,D) also evaluated were the percentage of each cell type producing IFN- (E, F) and the MFI of IFN- for each cell type presented in graph form. 4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with the greatest increase occurring between 7 and 10 DPI. responses of mice deficient in IFN- (Ifng/) or in the -chain of the IFN- receptor (Ifngr1/) were compared to those of WT mice. expression of Gbp2 (A), Irgm1 (B), Oasl2 (C), Oasl2 (C), Rsad2 (E), and Zc3hav1 (F) were examined by qRT-PCR in the brains and spinal cords of WT (black circle and solid line), Ifngr1/ (gray square and solid line), and Ifng/ (white circle and black dashed line) mice. viral RNA peaked at 3 to 5 DPI in the brains and spinal cords. at 7 DPI, viral RNA levels were higher in the brains and at 5 and 7 DPI in the spinal cords of WT mice. brains and spinal cords were examined for histopathological changes and inflammation at 0, 3, 5, and 7 DPI. perivascular cuffing and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the parenchyma in the brain were present at 7 DPI. inflammation in the brain and spinal cord of siNV-infected mice was likely due to trauma from the IC inoculation. representative photomicrographs were taken of H&E-stained brain (A,B) and spinal cord (C,D) sections from mock-infected mice. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate changes in the CLNs (C,D) and infiltration into the brain (E,F) of CD4+ T cells (C,E) and CD8+ T cells (D,F) at 5, 7, and 10 DPI. cell data are presented as both percentage of live cells and absolute cell counts. WT mice had more total mononuclear cells in the brain at 7 DPI. numbers of infiltrating CD8+ T cells peaked at 7 DPI. infiltration of CD4+ T cells occurred later with peaks at 10 DPI. the effect of IFN- signaling on the Function of Brain CD4+ T cells during SINV infection was due to infiltration of more macrophages and NK cells. the percentage of CD4+ T cells producing IFN- did not differ between WT and Ifngr1/ mice. Flow cytometry was used to examine the percentage of CD4+ T cells producing IFN- (A), IL-4 (B), IL-17a (C) or expressing both Foxp3 and CD25 (D) in WT (black bars), Ifngr1/ (gray bars), and Ifng/ (white bars) mice at 7 DPI. mRNAs for four cytokines associated with specific Th profiles were examined. mRNA expression of Il2 and Il10 was lower in Ifng/ mice. expression of Il17a was higher in Ifngr1/ mice. granzyme B MFI of CD8+ T cells from Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice was also higher than WT mice. expression of granzyme A (Figure 9F) and granzyme B (Figure 9G) in brain was lower in Ifng/ mice compared to WT and Ifngr1/ mice. expression differences between strains for granzyme K (Figure 9H), granzyme M (Figure 9I) and perforin (Figure 9J) were n = 3\u20139 pooled mice per strain per time point from 3\u20134 independent experiments. effectsor function of CD8+ T cells in spinal cords of infected mice were similar to brain in that IFN--producing CD8+. T cells were not detected in Ifng/ mice and were comparable between WT and Ifngr1/ mice. TNF- (Figure 9L) and GM-CSF (Figure 9M) production by CD8+ T cells was not different. percentage of CD8+ T cells producing granzyme B was lower in WT mice. Flow cytometry was used to examine the percentage of CD8+ T cells (A,C) or NK cells (B,D) expressing CD107a, indicative of degranulation. granzymes A and B are the primary granzymes involved in cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. granzyme production was lower in CD8+ T cells but higher in NK cells of WT mice compared to mice with impaired IFN- signaling. granzyme production was lower in CD8+ T cells but higher in NK cells of WT mice compared to mice with impaired IFN- signaling. the results suggest that IFN- signaling promotes the development of CD8+ TRM cells in the brain during SINV infection. the results suggest that IFN- signaling promotes the development of CD8+ TRM cells in the brain during SINV infection. infectious virus was measured by plaque assay after infection of cAP-7 (gray line) and dAP-7 (black line) cells infected with SINV TE at a MOI of 1 and either left untreated or treated with 500 U/mL IFN- 2 h prior to infection. dAP-7 cells infected with SINV were treated with 500 U/mL rat recombinant IFN- 2 h before infection, 2 HPI, or at 24 HPI. dAP-7 cells treated with IFN- prior to infection had significantly decreased virus production compared to untreated cells at 24, 32, and 48 HPI. viral RNA synthesis was significantly inhibited by IFN- treatment compared to untreated dAP-7 cells from 24 to 72 HPI. mRNA expression of representative antiviral ISGs was examined by qRT-PCR in dAP-7 cells treated with IFN-. qRT-PCR in dAP-7 cells infected with SINV at a MOI of 1 and left untreated (black circle and solid line), mock-infected and treated with 500 U/mL IFN- at 2 HPI (gray square and solid line) included Gbp2 (A), Irgm (B), Oasl2 (C), Rsad2 (D), and Zc3hav1 (E) CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were examined for cytokine production during phase 1 (5 and 7 DPI), phase 2 (10 and 14 DPI), and phase 3 (90 DPI) of infection. in the brain, NK cells were the predominant source of IFN- at 5 DPI. we characterized the percentages of each cell population producing IFN-. in the brain, the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN- increased over the course of infection, going from 40 to 60% at 5 and 7 DPI to over 80% at 10, 14, and 90 DPI. analysis of neuronal responses plus Oas1a was examined by qRT-PCR. expression of Gbp2, Irgm1, Oasl2, Rsad2 and Zc3hav1 was up regulated in the brains and spinal cords of all mice during SINV infection. expression of Gbp2 (Figure 4A) and Irgm1 (Figure 4B) at 5-10 DPI in the brain and spinal cord was higher in WT mice than Ifngr1/ data are presented as the mean SEM; dashed line indicates gene expression of 0 DPI tissue for each strain to which other time points were normalized. effect of IFN- Signaling on Viral RNA Clearance from the CNS of SINV-infected Mice Clearance of viral RNA from the CNS was examined. signaling results in delayed viral RNA clearance in vivo. likelihood of reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection increased. brains and spinal cords examined for histopathological changes. perivascular cuffing and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the parenchyma in the brain were present at 7 DPI in all SINV-infected mice. in the spinal cord, compared to mock-infected controls, SINV-infected WT and Ifngr1/ mice had more inflammation than Ifng/ mice. cells isolated from the CLNs and brains of WT, Ifngr1/ and Ifngr1/ mice were scored for inflammation using a four-point (brain) or three-point (spinal cord) system. cells isolated from the CLNs and brains of WT, Ifngr1/ and Ifngr1/ mice were examined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate changes in the CLNs (C,D) and infiltration into the brain (E,F) of CD4+ T cells (C,E) and CD8+ T cells (D,F) at 5, 7 and 10 DPI. n = 3\u20137 pooled mice per strain per time point from three independent experiments. WT mice have more inflammation (Figure 6) and more mononuclear cells (Figure 7B) but fewer CD8+ T cells (Figure 7F) in brain compared to Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice at 7 DPI. non-T cell immune cell populations were assessed. transcription factor (Figure 8I\u2013L) mRNAs associated with different T helper (Th) subsets. percentage of CD4+ T cells producing IL-4 (Th2 cells) was lower in Ifng/ mice than WT or Ifngr1/ mice. mRNA expression of Il2 (E), Il4 (F), Il17a (G), Il10 (H), Tbx21 (I), Gata3 (J), Rorc (K), and Foxp3 (L) were examined by qRT-PCR in WT (black circle and solid line), Ifngr1/ (gray square and solid line), and Ifng/ (white circle and black dashed line) mouse brains (n = 3\u20134 mice per strain per time point; CD4+ T cell differentiation mostly affected Ifng/ mice with fewer Th2 and Treg cells and Ifngr1/ mice with more Th17 cells. granzyme B MFI of CD8+ T cells from WT mice was also higher than WT mice. expression of granzyme A (Figure 9F) and granzyme B (Figure 9G) mRNAs in brain was lower in Ifng/ mice compared to WT and Ifngr1/ mice. expression differences between strains for granzyme K (Figure 9H), granzyme M (Figure 9I) and perforin (Figure 9J) were less pronounced. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the percentage of CD8+ T cells producing IFN- (K), TNF- (L), GM-CSF (M), and granzyme B (N) in the spinal cords of infected mice. effector function of CD8+ T cells in the spinal cords of infected mice were similar to the brain in that IFN-producing CD8+ T cells were not detected in Ifng/ mice. CD8+ T cells and NK cells exert their cytolytic effects through secretion of cytotoxic granzymes that kill target cells. extent of degranulation and granzyme production were examined in cells from the CLNs and brains of WT, Ifngr1/, and Ifng/ mice at 7 DPI. the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing CD107a was higher in Ifng/ mice than WT mice. granzymes A and B are the primary granzymes involved in cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. granzyme production was lower in CD8+ T cells but higher in NK cells of mice with impaired IFN- signaling. CD103+ TRM cells were assessed in CLNs and brains in WT, Ifngr1/, and Ifng/ mice at 7, 14, and 28 DPI to determine a role for IFN- in their development, maintenance, and survival. CD103+ TRM cells are a subset of memory T cells that do not circulate, but permanently remain at sites of infection. mRNAs for Gbp2 and Irgm1 GTPase proteins associated with autophagy were highly induced by IFN- signaling in SINV-infected neurons. RNA viruses, including the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), target IRGM to promote virus replication. rabies virus, canine distemper virus, west Nile virus (WNV) and JEV were induced later and to lesser extent. Rsad2 and Zc3hav1 were induced later and to lesser extent. the specific role for these ISGs in pathogenesis of IFN-mediated virus clearance from neurons will require further study. mRNA expression of cytokine IL-10 was significantly lower in Ifng/ mouse brains. mRNA expression of cytokine IL-10 was significantly lower compared to WT and Ifngr1/ mice at 7 DPI. cytotoxic activity and produce granzymes and perforin for delivery through granule exocytosis to activate caspases and induce target cell apoptosis. granzymes have non-cytotoxic as well as cytotoxic roles in pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis. granzymes A, H, and M cleave viral proteins important for virus replication. hnRNP K, which modulates viral RNA replication of CHIKV, enterovirus 71, dengue virus, and HIV-1, is substrate for granzyme B. IFN- produced by CD4+ T cells is required for generating CD8+ TRM cells in the lung after influenza virus infection. rapid clearance of LCMV by brain TRM cells depends on IFN- signaling and cytotoxic granule release."}
