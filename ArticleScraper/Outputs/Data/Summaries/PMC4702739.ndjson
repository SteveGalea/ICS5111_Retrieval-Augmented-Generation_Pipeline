{"summary": "to date, 124 validated species have been described. some species are known to be pathogenic for humans. others are considered commensals of the respiratory or genital tract (1). between January 2013 and December 2014, 644 people were enrolled into four different cohorts of patients. of these patients, 293 presented with tonsillitis, 23 presented with meningitis, 110 presented with acute diarrhea, and 218 were pilgrims sampled before departing from Marseille, France to Mecca (7). the specificities of the primers and probes were verified in silico by conducting a BLAST search in GenBank and by performing qPCR on purified genomic DNA from a panel of 77 bacterial strains. each dilution was tested by qPCR in duplicate, and a standard curve was generated. 23 (9%) were positive from the cohort of patients presenting with meningitis. 24/110 (22%) were positive from the cohort of patients with diarrhea (median age, 41) the prevalence (57%, 125/218) was significantly higher among pilgrims (median age, 62) than in the other cohorts (P 0.0001 using the 2 test) qPCR is routinely performed on brain abscesses, with positive results in 6/210 specimens since 2011 (8). in five cases, M. faucium was associated with a polymicrobial infection (two with Staphylococcus aureus, two with Streptococcus intermedius, and one with Pseudomonas aeruginosa), a total of 10 patients harbored M. faucium in brain abscesses the pathogenicity of M. faucium in brain abscesses is questionable. it has been found only in polymicrobial infections. only mycoplasma salivarium (11) and M. faucium have been found in brain abscesses."}
