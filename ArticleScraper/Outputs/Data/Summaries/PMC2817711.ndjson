{"summary": "retroviruses are RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate called a provirus, which becomes integrated into the host cell chromosome. when integration occurs in a germ cell, an endogenous retrovirus can be inherited as part of the genetic legacy of the species. the blue, green, and orange lightning bolts represent inferred viruses based on positive selection of TRIM5 [18] and the brown line is an inferred virus based on positive selection of ZAP [19] simplified for representation, here. each color corresponds to inferred paleoviruses based on positive selection on a particular antiviral gene calculated on the phylogenetic tree in bottom of the figure. endogenous copies of viruses are but a subset of the ancient and extinct viruses that we call paleoviruses. the existence of some additional paleoviruses can be deciphered by estimating the age of the last common ancestor of extant viruses. this is likely to be an underestimate due to the extinction of viral lineages. the case for ancient RNA viruses is even more vexing because high mutation rate essentially obliterates bioinformatic signals and our ability to meaningfully estimate ancestry beyond a few million years. this approach is based on a striking evolutionary signature called positive selection that these viruses impart on antiviral genes in primate genomes. mutations that change amino acids in gene sequences (non-synonymous mutations) relative to mutations that do not change amino acids (synonymous mutations) will lead to dramatic rates of change of non-synonymous mutations. signatures of evolutionary changes in protein-coding sequences of antiviral genes allow us to infer the selection of ancient host species due to paleoviruses. the comparison of sequence data from multiple orthologs of primate antiviral genes allows us to infer that a given gene was under positive selection. this can be done by reconstructing the ancestral coding sequence of an antiviral gene at each node of a primate phylogenetic tree in silico. each case of positive selection for an antiviral gene then implies the presence of at least one paleovirus on that branch. a gene fusion event in a particular primate lineage can be informative even if the \u201cnewly born\u201d antiviral gene eventually degrades due to relaxed selection. the time-period under selection can only be ascribed to a branch on the evolutionary tree, which may represent several million years of evolution. simian primate evolution is particularly tractable. the same antiviral gene may have acted on different viruses over the evolutionary record. this limitation is exemplified by the human major histocompatibility class I genes. antiviral genes that also play a role in limiting other microbial pathogens would confound the assessment of what type of pathogen was responsible for the positive selection. we believe it is possible to identify candidate classes of paleoviruses based on analyses of positive selection in antiviral genes. original data is found in [30] and shows that the antiviral gene TRIM5 restricted HIV-1 better at points in evolution earlier than the chimp\u2013human common ancestor. changes in this region cause a gain of restriction to some viruses, while causing a loss to others [33],[45]\u2013[47]. there may be cases of \u201cmissing\u201d viral species where extinction of a virus that is present in sister primate species could indicate the aftermath of a virus\u2013host interaction that is pleovirology could be viewed as the study of ancient viruses that primate genomes encountered and defeated during evolution. this view emphasizes that our current antiviral repertoire was not optimized to combat present infections, but rather is the product of selection for survival of our species' past infections. analysis of amino acids on antiviral genes driven by selection of ancient pathogens can be used to identify interface between the host protein and the virus. we have focused on paleoviruses of humans and primate ancestors in this essay. the same arguments can be made and lines of research can be applied to nearly any set of animal or plant families for which virus\u2013host relationships exist."}
