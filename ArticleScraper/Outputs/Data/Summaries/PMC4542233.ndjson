{"summary": "paramyxoviruses are a subfamily of the paramyxoviridae family (order Mononegavirales) of enveloped, nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. members of the paramyxovirus family show diverse tissue tropism and infect a variety of species in a fashion that does not appear to be specific to genus classification. feron (IFN-) mRNA production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. mRNA expression of IFN- and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was enhanced at day 2 in the spleen of chickens (8). despite decades of research characterizing the pathogenesis of different isolates, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of disease caused by NDV in the host. avian -defensins, cathelicidins, and liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 have been detected. they display a wide range of microbicidal or microbiostatic activities against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. to date, knowledge of the host immune responses in pigeons induced by PPMV-1 still is lacking. a total of 45 pigeons, hatched in captivity, were used in the present study. they were provided food and water ad libitum. all of them lacked NDV-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. specific cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a superscript III kit (Invitrogen) the nucleotide sequences of -defensins, TLRs, and iNOS from birds were selected and aligned by using the lasergene sequence analysis software package (DNAStar) the consensus sequences were selected and used for primer design.

PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) to confirm the amplification, followed by sequencing using the Sanger method. basic searches were conducted using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) using three entire Columba_AvBD cDNAs from pigeons. tLR7 (qPCR) TTCTGGCCACAGATGTGACC CCTTCAACTTGGCAGTGCAG 219 XM_005512700 TLR15 (qPCR) GAACAGCCAGCTCTCAATGCACAACTT 103 XM_005503254 -Actin (qPCR) cDNA fragments that encode the Columba_AvBDs were amplified by PCR from the respective plasmids described above. the resulting plasmids were designated recombinant Columba_AvBD2, Columba_AvBD7, and Columba_AvBD10. expression of the fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) the fusion proteins were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 80 V, using the Mini-Protean III system (Bio-Rad, Beijing, China), and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (30). the concentration of the purified Columba_AvBDs was determined using bovine serum albumin as the standard (31) the embryos that died between 24 h and 7 days postinoculation were evaluated by hemagglutination (HA) assays. the pigeons were monitored for clinical signs for up to 21 days postinfection (dpi) and killed at 3 and 7 dpi (five individuals at each time point) the assays were performed using 2 l of total RNA and the OneStep real-time PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian Co., Ltd.) in a 20-l reaction mixture on a lightCycler 480II real-time PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to previous studies (14, 34), serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids containing pigeon - recombinant expression and purification of pigeons infected with PPMV-1. the sequences were determined by RT-PCR of RNA from pigeons. full-length sequences of these peptides shared high amino acid identities. columba_AvBD2, Columba_AvBD7, and Columba_AvBD10 shared more than 95% identities with the available TLR and iNOS sequences of pigeons or chickens. the signal sequences of the AvBDs are italicized. the six conserved cysteines (C) are underlined. recombinant Columba_AvBDs displayed antiviral activity against PPMV-1 in vitro. the 6His-tagged Columba_AvBDs were expressed in an insoluble form in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. these peptides then were purified and refolded using a commercial purification and refolding kit. freshly isolated pigeon red blood cells were incubated with different concentrations of AvBDs. release of hemoglobin, as a measure of hemolysis, was measured at 405 nm. we detected significantly higher levels of AvBD2 expression in the cecal tonsil, lungs, and proventriculus of PPMV-1-infected pigeons at 7 dpi compared with expression levels in both the control and infected pigeons at 3 dpi. in contrast, AvBD7 was detectable in only two (bone marrow and trachea) of the 12 tissues investigated. we analyzed five TLRs (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, and 15) and found that all five were detected in the 12 tissues of pigeons. we did not observe any significant differences in regulation of TLR2 or TLR5 expression in the 12 tissues investigated in infected pigeons compared to those of the control group. pigeons of each group were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 3 and 7 dpi. iNOS levels were normalized to the levels of -actin in the same samples. all assays were performed in triplicate, with five replicates per experiment. PPMV-1 infection induces an increase in mRNA expression of both AvBD2 and AvBD10. cDNA copy numbers in tissue samples from five pigeons of each group were measured by qPCR at 3 and 7 dpi. gene levels were normalized to the levels of -actin in the same samples. chickens, and geese, 64.7% identity with AvBD7 from chickens and ducks. more than 80% identity with AvBD10 from quails, chickens, geese, and ducks. predicted amino acid sequences of all three of these peptides had six cysteine residues and the GXC motif. total proteins from BL21 containing AvBD2, -7, and -10 (without IPTG induction), respectively; protein molecular weight marker. to determine whether these three Columba_AvBDs displayed antiviral activity against PPMV-1 in vitro, the 6His-tagged Columba_AvBDs (i.e., 2, 7, and 10) were expressed in an insoluble form in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. no significant change was observed at 48 hpi for these three AvBDs compared to the level of the control. the virus titers were tested by hemagglutinin (HA) at 24, 36, and 48 hpi. the mortality rate of pigeons after PPMV-1 (strain PI/CH/LHLJ/110822) infection exceeded 70%. the onset of viral shedding via the oral and cloacal routes ranged from 3 to 7 dpi. as a result, we used samples taken at 3 and 7 dpi to study host immune response. cDNA copy numbers in the tissue samples from five pigeons were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 3 and 7 dpi. AvBD levels were normalized to the levels of -actin in the same samples. infected pigeons, levels of iNOS expression were significantly upregulated in 4 of the 12 tissues investigated. cDNA copy numbers in the tissue samples from five pigeons of each group were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 3 and 7 dpi. iNOS levels were normalized to the levels of -actin in the same samples. correlation between AvBD2 and TLR7 expression in the proventriculus (r = 0.99, P 0.01) and between AvBD10 and TLR7 expression in the spleen (r = 0.98 or r = 0.99, P 0.01). PPMV-1 infection induces an increase in the mRNA expression of both AvBD2 and AvBD10. this suggests that both AvBDs play significant roles in the resistance of pigeons to detailed analysis of host immune responses of pigeons against PPMV-1 infection has not been performed due to difficulties attributed to the fact that only a few host immune-related genes have been characterized in pigeons. in this study, we identified full-length sequences of three novel AvBDs (i.e., 2, 7, and 10) from pigeons. the immune response of pigeons to PPMV-1 infection has been poorly studied. a total of 12 tissues, including the six tissues, were taken from experimental pigeons. both AvBD2 and -10 were widely distributed in the 12 tissues investigated. loads were detected in the lungs, proventriculus, and kidneys, in gross lesions, such as a proventriculus hemorrhage and kidney enlargement. the effect of pathogenic microorganisms on the expression of the AvBDs of other avian species has been investigated extensively in recent years. infection caused the upregulation of AvBD2, AvBD10, and AvBD12 in vivo. in mammals, it has been reported that both TLR3 and TLR7 recognize viral PAMPs, and TLR3 detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from viral replication. TLR3 and TLR7 are the only TLRs implicated in antiviral responses in birds. pigeons may have developed specific immune mechanisms. further studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of TLRs to the host defense in pigeons."}
