{"summary": "acute respiratory infections are among the leading causes of disease and mortality in developing and developed countries. seasonal influenza epidemics attack 10\u201320% of the human population, leading to 290\u2013650 thousand deaths/year worldwide each year. the world is confronted every 10\u201340 years with newly emerging influenza A virus infections. despite significant efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine, there are no approved vaccines for MERS-CoV until now. genetically and phenotypically stable vaccines represent a promising alternative to control IAV and MERS-CoV infections. an Egyptian MERS-CoV isolate was obtained from the virus collection of Center of Scientific excellence for Influenza Viruses. the two viruses were used for preparation of the OMVs-based dual vaccine and inactivated vaccines were used as positive control. the plasmid pMP-HA-Gi [21] encoding the HA of Cal-H1N1pdm2009 was used as template DNA for F1 and F3. the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Spike-MERS-CoV encoding the spike protein from the isolate MERS-CoV/Camel/Egypt/HKU-NRCE-270/2013 was used as a template for F2.

corresponding to HA0-RBD (77 kDa + 25 kDa equal 102 kDa) female BALB/c mice were immunized with 5 g/mouse of OMVs-H1/RBD and OMVs-empty in comparison with inactivated H1N1pdm2009 and inactivated MERS-CoV as a positive controls. at two weeks post-vaccination, mice vaccinated with inactivated H1N1pdm2009 virus or OMVs-H1/RBD revealed a 2\u20133. four weeks after vaccination we observed a drop in the HAI titers in these mice due to the booster vaccination at week three. the two groups vaccinated with OMVs-H1/RBD or inactivated H1N1pdm2009 showed a significant increase in geometric mean HAI antibody titers to 145.4 (7.2 log2) and 420 (8.7 log2) at week six, and at week eight, the geometric mean HAI antibody titers decreased to 70.7 (6.1 a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) showed complete neutralization (PRNT50 titer, approximately >1:160) after eight weeks of first immunization of active MERS-CoV. vaccinated- and control groups of mice were infected with wild type Cal-H1N1pdm09 virus. pMP-H1/RBD is designed to link the RBD and HA0 fragments into a single polypeptide chain. the final fusion protein contains amino acid residues 1\u2013240 of the RBD, aa residues 1\u20137 of the LP and aa residues 1-566 of the HA0. the target sequences of MERS-CoV (RBD, 720 bp, 240 aa) and H1N1pdm09 (HA) were amplified, purified, digested and ligated to pMPccdB vector. ligated plasmids harboring the target sequences were transformed into bacteria. the presence of the RBD from MERS-CoV and the H1-HA from H1N1pdm2009 was examined by immunoblot analysis using 5 g of purified OMVs-H1/RBD. the blotting pattern confirmed the presence of RBD-linked HA viral protein;
