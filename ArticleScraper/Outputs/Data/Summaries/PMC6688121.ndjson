{"summary": "viral infectious diseases continue to pose serious threats to public health, as well as emerging epidemics of e.g., Zika virus (ZIKV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Measles virus (MV), or Ebola virus (EBOV). Molecular epidemiological techniques have proven to be important and effective in informing public health and therapeutic decisions in the context of viral pathogens (6, 7) the field of phylodynamics has generated new opportunities to obtain a more detailed understanding of evolutionary histories. the ability of molecular epidemiological analyses, and phylodynamic analyses in particular, to fully exploit the information embedded in viral sequence data has significantly improved through a combination of technological innovations and advances in inference frameworks during the past decades. enetic tree visualization efforts constituted an integral part of phylogenetic inference software packages. the longstanding use of phylogenies in molecular epidemiological analyses has however led to the emergence of increasingly feature-rich visualization tools over time. the advent of the new research disciplines such as phylodynamics necessitated more complex visualizations. this review illustrates the evolution in phylogenetically-informed visualization modalities for evolutionary inference and epidemic modeling based on viral sequence data. a closer inspection of how tools for manipulation, visualization and interpretation of evolutionary scenarios have steadily grown over time reveals different trends of interest. a closer inspection of how tools for manipulation, visualization and interpretation of evolutionary scenarios have steadily grown over time reveals different trends of interest. etic tree is the backbone of phylodynamic visualization. these analyses also produce other types of output that go beyond visualizing phylogenies. visualization tools are reaching the limits of their capacity to comprehensibly present analysis results of large datasets. s and Solutions Phylogenetic tree visualizations have played a central role since the earliest evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analyses of fast-evolving viral pathogens. the first computer programs aimed at constructing phylogenies were only equipped with minimal tree drawing and printing facilities. standalone, phylogenetically-oriented programs were specifically developed to interact with tree reconstruction output and to ease tree editing and viewing. software packages that aim to visualize phylogenetic trees have implemented various solutions to accommodate systematic exploration of large phylogenies. phylo.io (31) improves the legibility of large trees by automatically collapsing nodes so that an overview of the tree remains visible at any given time. pastML (33) allows visualizing the tree annotated with reconstructed ancestral states as a zoomable HTML map based on the Cytoscape framework (34). grapetree (36) initially collapses branches if there are more than 20,000 nodes in the tree and then uses a static layout that splits the tree layout task into sequential node layout tasks. uncertainty in divergence time estimates of ancestral nodes is usually displayed with a horizontal (node) bar. ancestral reconstructions of discrete or continuous trait states at the inner nodes of a tree are increasingly facilitated by various probabilistic frameworks. a third challenge consists of the visual integration of metadata with phylogenetic trees. visualization and accompanying interpretation are a critical component of infectious disease epidemiological and evolutionary analyses. many researchers use visualization software during analyses for data exploration, identifying inconsistencies, and refining their data set to ensure well-supported conclusions. management services and registration of user accounts [iTOL; (18)], while command-line tools (Gotree; https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree) increasingly enable exporting trees that can directly be uploaded to iTOL. we have already covered a wide range of software packages for visualizing associated trait data with a focus on phylogeography. SpreaD3 animates the reconstructed virus dispersal over time. we use centroid coordinates for the US states to enable this visualization. the transitions between the states are colored according to the US state of destination for that particular transition. tree leaves are colored according to continent of sampling, with a size corresponding to the host status and shape indicating the completeness of the CDS. a heatmap was added to denote the presence of amino acid mutations at three chosen genome positions. a particular clade was highlighted in blue based on a given internal node. a series of trees can be visualized in a circle facing inwards with a particular isolate highlighted in all plotted phylogenies. areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from the posterior tree distribution was constructed using a software tool that is part of the BEAST distribution. this tree contains at its internal nodes the age estimates of all of the internal nodes, along with discrete probability distributions for the inferred location and host traits. the further we go back in time, the more uncertain the inferred location states become. iTOL (18) is another application that can take an MCC tree as its input file. it allows annotating branches and nodes of the phylogenetic tree using simple text files. iTOL allows importing external text files with annotations through an easy drag-and-drop interface. the latest developments generalize toward interactive web-based visualization of any phylogenetic trait history. the latest developments generalize toward interactive web-based visualization of any phylogenetic trait history. we have created a web-based visualization of our analyzed RABV data set by loading the obtained MCC tree into the SpreaD3 phylodynamic visualization software package. web-based visualization platforms enhance collaborations and output dissemination in a very efficient and simple manner. online accessible visualization tools such as iTOL (18) offer tree management options to organize and save different projects, annotated datasets and trees for their users. animations resulting from software packages such as SPREAD, SpreaD3 and Nextstrain can be hosted on the authors' website or uploaded as supplementary materials. animations resulting from software packages such as SPREAD, SpreaD3 and Nextstrain can be captured into a video file format. other common visualizations in Phylodynamics Phylogenies reconstructed from viral sequence data and their corresponding annotated tree-like drawings and animations lie at the heart of many evolutionary and epidemiological studies that involve phylogenomics. transmission trees describe transmission events between hosts and require visualizations that are tailored to the analysis objectives (80\u201382) tanglegrams allow mapping tree tip locations to mapped geographical locations using GenGis (58, 85) the use of phylogenetic networks can also visualize phylogenetic incongruences. this could be due to reticulate evolutionary phenomena such as recombination (e.g., HIV-1) and hybridization (e.g., influenza virus) events (30, 32, 87) software tools such as iTOL (18) and PhyloGeoTool (17) offer functionalities to visualize placements of sequence data onto an existing phylogeny. software tools such as iTOL (18) and PhyloGeoTool (17) offer functionalities to visualize placements of sequence data onto an existing phylogeny. analyses and visualizations of circulating strains and their antigenic properties using the nextflu framework (47, 91) other diverse examples include investigations of the impact of country-specific public health interventions on transmission dynamics (94, 95), the identification of distinctive socio-demographic, clinical and epidemiological features associated with regional and global epidemics. an extensive array of software and tools for the manipulation, editing and annotation of output visualizations in the field of pathogen phylodynamics is available to date. the increasing recognition for visualization tools in support of viral outbreak surveillance and control has stimulated the advent of more complex and fully integrated frameworks and platforms. phylogenomics and phylodynamics visualizations will increasingly implement and adapt technologies from other disciplines such as visual analytics. new era in visualization applications will collaboratively foster visualizations that track virus epidemics and outbreaks in real-time and with high resolution. initial but already comprehensive list of publications was compiled from backward and forward citation searches of the various visualization software packages the authors have (co-)developed."}
