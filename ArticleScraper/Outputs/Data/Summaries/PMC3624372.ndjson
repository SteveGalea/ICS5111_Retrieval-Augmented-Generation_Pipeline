{"summary": "noVs are the leading cause of nonbacterial acute, epidemic gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. they belong to the Caliciviridae family and are subdivided into five genogroups (GI to GV) (1, 2). Genogroup I contains the norwalk virus, a prototype human norovirus, along with Southampton and Chiba viruses. there is no cell culture system or animal model that supports efficient replication of human noroviruses. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein cleaved into six nonstructural proteins. p48, p41, p22, VPg, protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. the five dipeptide cleavage sites in the polyprotein are shown in red, with black arrows indicating the cleavage site. either Q-G, E-G, or E-A as the cleavage junction (5, 17, 21\u201324) these sites exhibit significant variations in amino acid composition in both the N-terminal (positions P5 to P2) and C-terminal (positions P2\u2032 to P5\u2032) sides flanking the scissile bond. previous studies indicated that there is a preferential temporal order in the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein by the NoV protease (17). a series of tripeptide aldehyde inhibitors were synthesized and screened via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay (14) to determine their inhibition constants. crystallographic analyses of NV protease bound to the three inhibitors that exhibited the most potent inhibition. the results of these studies will be useful in the design of new and more potent and broad-spectrum inhibitors. a VPg-Pro fusion construct was made with the expectation of obtaining the structure of VPg and possibly the cleavage site between VPg and the protease within the NV polyprotein bound in the protease active site. a thrombin cleavage site was engineered into the construct to later cleave the N-terminal His6 tag with thrombin. the construct containing the native C-terminal tail is referred to as VPg-ProC139A. the same protocol was used to mutate the last 4 amino acids of the protease (TALE) into the amino acids INFE. all positive clones underwent sequence analysis to confirm the desired mutations. inhibition of protease decreased fluorescence intensity, allowing screening of prospective inhibitors. VPg-ProC139A (INFE) construct was concentrated to 7 mg/ml and crystallized at 20\u00b0C. crystals were cryoprotected with a solution containing 20% glycerol. all three inhibitor-protease cocrystals were obtained in 0.1 to 0.3 M potassium thiocyanate and 25 to 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2,000 buffer. the crystals were cryoprotected with 25 to 30% glycerol and flash frozen. the data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Data processing and refinement statistics Parameter Description or valuea for protease in complex. b Rmerge = |Ihkl Ihkl|/|Ihkl| 100, where Ihkl is the intensity of an individual hkl reflection and Ihkl is the mean intensity for all measured values of this reflection. the summation is over all equivalent intensities. the final refinement statistics are included in Table 1. a VPg-Pro construct in which the protease was inactivated by mutation of the active site Cys139 to Ala was cloned into the pET-46 Ek/LIC expression vector. thrombin cleavage site was engineered into the construct to later cleave the N-terminal His6 tag with thrombin. the resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells to express the His6-tagged recombinant protein. the construct containing the native C-terminal tail is referred to as VPg-ProC139A (TALE) the construct with the four mutated amino acids in the C-terminal tail is referred to as VPg-ProC139A (INFE) the activity of the purified NV protease was measured in the presence of different aldehyde inhibitors. the VPg-ProC139A (TALE) construct was concentrated to 7 mg/ml and crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20\u00b0C. crystals were cryoprotected with a solution containing 20% glycerol or 20% ethylene glycol reconstituted with mother liquor. the data sets for VPg-ProC139A (TALE), VPg-ProC139A (INFE), syc-10\u2013protease, and syc-08\u2013protease complexes were collected at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source, Chicago, IL. all data sets were processed using HKL2000 (31). b Rmerge = |Ihkl Ihkl|/|Ihkl| 100, where Ihkl is the intensity of an individual hkl reflection and Ihkl is the mean intensity for all measured values of this reflection. the summation is over all equivalent intensities. c Rwork =||Fo| |Fc||/|Fo| 100, where Fo represents the observed structure factor amplitudes and Fc represents the structure factor amplitudes calculated from the atomic model. the protease part of VPg-ProC139A (TALE) was clearly represented in the electron density map, but the density for the VPg protein was not visible. further analyses of different VPg constructs by a variety of biophysical methods suggested that VPg is predominantly an intrinsically disordered protein. the VPg-ProC139A (TALE) construct crystallized in the P6122 space group. the C-terminal TALE residues of molecule A are completely inserted into the substrate binding pocket of molecule B. the backbone and side chain conformations of the TAL region of molecule B vary considerably compared to those of the TALE region of molecule A. the active site (H30, C139, and E54) is represented with red sticks. the C-terminal tail of molecule A inserts fully into the active site of molecule B. the active site residues E54, H30, and C139 are indicated in red. TALE interacts with the eII -strand backbone (gray) of the protease. oxygen of P136 faces inward, forming a water-mediated hydrogen bond with N2 of the active site residue H30. the backbone carbonyl group of P136 is now pointing away from the active site and the backbone NH of G137 pointing toward the active site. this carbonyl group of the substrate also engages in a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of the C139A mutant. the peptide in the INFE structure is flipped, indicating that the peptide flipping is induced by binding of the substrate to the active site of the protease. the C-terminal tail was built in the Fo Fc difference electron density map (3). the close-up view of the inset shows INFE (orange sticks) bound to the substrate binding pocket of the protease. O1 of the Glu-P1 side chain participates in hydrogen bond interactions with N2 of the imidazole ring of H157 and the hydroxyl group of T134. in the native protease structure, the hydroxyl group of the T134 side chain is hydrogen bonded to H157 (N1) via a water molecule, whereas in the substrate-bound structures, this water molecule is replaced by O1 of Glu-P1. in the unbound state, the bII-cII loop is positioned pointing toward the active site. with TALE substrate binding, the S2 pocket opens up slightly to accommodate the leu side chain. alterations indicate the inherent ability of the S2 pocket to undergo conformational changes in response to binding of different substrates. compared to the S1 and S2 pockets, the S3 pocket is not as well defined. in the NV polyprotein, residues occupying the P3 position vary considerably. the S4 pocket resembles the S2 pocket in its hydrophobic nature. Ile-P4 of the INFE substrate makes hydrophobic interactions only with I109, a network of hydrogen bonds involving Q110, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of R108, and a water molecule. substrate-based aldehyde inhibitors were designed to mimic the substrate residues P3 to P1 of the NV polyprotein. inhibitors Inhibitor Structure Ki (M)a syc-10 0.12 syc-59 0.56 syc-08 1.5 a Determined for protease in presence of the inhibitor. the peptide backbone of the inhibitors interacts with the eII -strand of the protease, forming an antiparallel-sheet. the mechanism by which these aldehyde inhibitors inactivate the protease activity is likely due to this covalent bond formation. the efficiency of inhibition is likely driven by how these inhibitors interact with the protease. syc-10, syc-59, and syc-08 form covalent bonds with the active site (red sticks) the syc-10 and syc-59 groups fill the hydrophobic S4 pocket. the CBZ group of syc-08 faces the solvent. syc-10 and syc-59 inhibitors contain a glutamine derivative. syc-10 and syc-59 have the smaller hydrophobic residue Leu at this position, as in the TALE substrate. a noticeable difference is seen in regard to various side chain conformations of Q110 and R112 in the S2 pocket, particularly in the structures with P2-Phe. the C-terminal tail in the syc-59-bound structure is mostly disordered from residue 174 onward, as in the native protease structure. in the latter structure, the C-terminal tail of the neighboring molecule is positioned close to the S4 pocket. the hydrophobic residue L180 inserts into this pocket and makes hydrophobic interactions with residues I109, T161, T166 and V168. the substrate backbone hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl and amide groups of the eII -strand of the protease, forming an antiparallel -sheet. these interactions allow correct positioning of the terminal residue (P1) of the substrate for proteolytic cleavage. the terminal carboxyl group of P1 is properly aligned for nucleophilic attack by C139, reminiscent of the tetrahedral intermediate state. the surface representation of monomer B of the protease, with TAL (blue sticks) partially bound to the substrate binding pocket. the last two residues of the TALE substrate (yellow sticks), LE, bound to the active site (red sticks) the TALE region forms hydrogen bond interactions (black dashed lines) with the active site's H30 residue (red) and a water molecule (blue sphere) in molecule A, the amide group of G137 points away from the active site, toward the solvent, and the carbonyl oxygen of P136 faces inward, forming a water-mediated hydrogen bond with N2 of the active site residue H30. the carbonyl group of the substrate engages in a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of the C139A mutant. the VPg-ProC139A construct is crystallized in the P6522 space group. the C-terminal INFE region inserts entirely into the substrate binding pocket of the neighboring symmetry-related molecule. in this structure, the C-terminal INFE region inserts into the substrate binding pocket of the neighboring symmetry-related molecule. the close-up view of the inset shows INFE (orange sticks) bound to the substrate binding pocket of the protease. substrate interactions involving the S1 and S2 binding pockets. the majority of the interactions with both substrates occur at the S1 and S2 pockets. OH also participates indirectly in the stabilization of the P1 side chain. Glu-P1 is further stabilized by several hydrophobic interactions in the S1 pocket. these interactions allow the terminal carbonyl carbon of the substrate to be positioned appropriately relative to the nucleophilic Cys139 residue. the active site is depicted in red, the S1 pocket in green, and the S2 pocket in teal. the active site is depicted in red, the S1 pocket in green, and the S2 pocket in teal. the S4 pocket narrows when the TALE substrate binds the pocket. in the NV polyprotein, residues occupying the P3 position vary considerably. besides conserved backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bond interactions involving the P3 residue of the substrates and A160, the other interactions vary with the side chain composition of the P3 residue. three most potent inhibitors, syc-10 (Ki = 0.12 M), syc-59 (Ki = 0.56 M), and syc-8 (Ki = 1.5 M), were cocrystallized with the NV protease for crystallographic analyses. the simulated annealing Fo Fc omit map unambiguously showed the density for the inhibitor. all three inhibitors exhibit similar binding modes, not only between themselves but also with the substrates. the peptide backbone of the inhibitors interacts with the eII -strand of the protease, forming an antiparallel -sheet. unlike the case in the substrate-protease structures, in the inhibitor-bound structures this peptide unit remains in the native orientation. syc-10, syc-59, and syc-08 form covalent bonds with the C139 residue of the active site (red sticks) in the syc-10\u2013protease complex, the main chain amine group of G137 and the main chain oxygen of P136 flip, disrupting oxyanion hole formation. the dashed lines represent hydrogen bond formation between the syc-10 inhibitor carbonyl group and the active site H30 residue (red sticks) and the syc-10 and syc-59 inhibitors contain a glutamine derivative, N,N-dimethyl glutamine, at the P1 position, whereas in syc-08, the P1 side chain is an,-diamino propionic aldehyde. in all three inhibitor-bound structures, the P1 side chain is involved in hydrogen bond interactions with H157 and T134, similar to P1-Glu of the substrates. inhibitor-bound structures exhibit correlated changes with the S2 pocket. the N-terminal CBZ group of the inhibitors interacts with the S4 pocket. in the substrate-bound structures, the C-terminal tail of the protease molecule inserts into the substrate binding site. hydrophobic interactions with residues I109, T161, T166, and V168 suggest that the C-terminal residues have a natural tendency to interact with the substrate binding site. the relatively more potent syc-10 and syc-59 inhibitors compete with the C-terminal tail more effectively than the weaker syc-08 inhibitor. the proteases in these viruses cleave their respective polyproteins at multiple sites. the structure of the B molecule in the TALE-bound structure discussed above exhibits a different conformation. these observations suggest that formation of the extended -strand conformation is induced only upon binding to the protease and that the C-terminal residues have the propensity to adopt multiple conformations. this flexibility may also have been a major contributing factor to the total lack of density for VPg in our crystal structures obtained using a VPg-ProC139A construct. protease-substrate complexes from other viral systems have Gln in the P1 position. glu and Gln make identical sets of interactions with the side chains of His and Thr. in most cases the side chain of the His residue is positioned appropriately by its interactions with a Tyr residue. amide group (of G137) forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal carbonyl oxygen (anion) of the P1 residue. the carbonyl group (of Pro136) is positioned inward toward the active site, participating in the hydrogen bond interaction with the catalytic residue H30. the possibility that flipping is due to the C139A mutation can be ruled out because in molecule A of the TALE-bound crystal structure with a partially inserted C-terminal tail, the peptid a systematic comparative analysis was carried out to infer the effect of substrate binding on the oxyanion hole conformation. a proper oxyanion hole conformation with the amide group correctly pointing toward the substrate binding site is observed in the unbound structure itself. however, whether the crystallization conditions played a role in \u201cpeptide flipping\u201d is unclear. changes in the overall size of the S2 pocket are caused mainly by the inherent flexibility of the loop (bII-cII), which constitutes a major portion of this pocket. similar changes in the S2 pocket are also observed in the inhibitor-bound structures with P2-Leu (syc-59) and P2-Phe (syc-10 and syc-8) the correlation between the nature of the P2 and P4 residues is evident in the five protease binding sites in the NV polyprotein. the first two sites in the polyprotein contain P2-Leu and P4-Phe. the first two sites in the polyprotein contain P2-Leu and P4-Phe. the three and makes the most contacts with the protease. syc-59 exhibits identical interactions with the S1 pocket due to the same Gln derivative in the P1 position. the protective group, as a surrogate P4 residue, fits into the S4 pocket with several stabilizing hydrophobic interactions. a systematic analysis of protease-substrate and protease-inhibitor complexes will be useful not only for noroviruses but also for other serine-like viral proteases. a common feature of these proteases is their ability to recognize multiple substrates with varied sequences flanking the scissile bond. a common feature of these proteases is their ability to recognize multiple substrates with varied sequences flanking the scissile bond protease-inhibitor complexes may be effective protease inhibitors. they may also be applicable to other viral serine-like proteases. in the native NV protease structure, C-terminal residues 174 to 181 are disordered. VPg conformation allows protease to interact with the eII -strand of the protease to form an antiparallel -sheet, imparting a stabilizing effect on substrate binding. in proteases of caliciviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses, the peptide backbone of the substrate adopts a similar extended conformation. s have Gln in the P1 position (46) in all these proteases, the Glu or Gln forms hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains of His and Thr. in most cases the side chain of the His residue is positioned appropriately by its interactions with a Tyr residue. alanine substitution of these residues abolished the catalytic activity of the protease. the carbonyl group (of Pro136) is positioned inward toward the active site, participating in the hydrogen bond interaction with the catalytic residue H30. despite the C139A mutation, the peptide orientation remains the same as in the native structure. however, the orientation of the peptide unit remains the same as in the native structure. a systematic comparative analysis was carried out to infer the effect of substrate binding on the oxyanion hole conformation on the oxyanion hole conformation. in the native protease structure of foot-and-mouth disease, the oxyanion hole is properly configured, perhaps because of the presence of a sulfate ion in close proximity to the oxyanion hole. similar changes in the S2 pocket are also observed in the inhibitor-bound structures with P2-Leu (syc-59) and P2-Phe (syc-10 and syc-8). the same protease with and without bound ligands provides concrete evidence for how the S2 pocket is modulated. the syc-10 inhibitor is the most potent of the three and makes the most contacts with the protease. the syc-10 inhibitor is the most potent of the three and makes the most contacts with the protease. the protective group, as a surrogate P4 residue, fits snugly into the S4 pocket. the second most potent inhibitor, syc-59, exhibits identical interactions with the S1 pocket due to the same Gln derivative in the P1 position. but the interactions in the S4 pocket are not as substantial because of the widening of the S4 pocket due to the same Gln derivative in the P1 position. maximizing the interactions in the S1, S2, and S4 pockets has a direct impact on the potency of the inhibitors. a systematic analysis of protease-substrate and protease-inhibitor complexes will be useful not only for noroviruses but also for other serine-like viral proteases. a common feature of these proteases is their ability to recognize multiple substrates with varied sequences flanking the scissile bond. l of the conserved cysteine in the active site by nucleophilic addition could be effective protease inhibitors. from our comparative analysis, we have suggested a structural basis for the differential potency of these peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors."}
