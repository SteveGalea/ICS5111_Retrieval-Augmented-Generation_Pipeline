{"summary": "the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R) won't relate ability of its antioxidant. production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. PCD is a process by which damaged, aged, or otherwise unwanted cells are eliminated. many viruses are capable of inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. many studies suggest that ROS are not directly involved in the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells. Q7R was isolated from aerial parts of Houttuynia cordata using a previously described method [15]. Viruses, Cell lines and Reagents Vero were a reagent grade. PEDV CV 777 (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus) was obtained from national veterinary research & quarantine service in Korea. DCFH-DA is a stable compound that easily diffuses in to cells. it is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to yield a reduced, non-fluorescent compound, DCFH. cells oxidized the DCFH to highly fluorescent 2', and 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) DNA was treated with 0.1 mg/ml Rnase A for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. all other chemicals were a reagent grade. the level of intracellular ROS was measured by the alteration of fluorescence resulting from oxidation of 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. cells were treated with Q7R and other reagents for a time period indicated in the figure legends. in 5% CO2 for 2 days, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (TE buffer;10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) incubated for 10 min on ice, then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. 7R of 10 g/ml were added after incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. the morphology of cells was investigated under microscope and a photograph taken. the effect of Q7R on ROS increased by PEDV infection. at 3 h post-infection, PEDV infection resulted in a drastic increase of intracellular ROS, which was strongly decreased by NAC but not by Q7R. trolox strongly exhibited antiviral activity at 100 g/ml concentration. but decreased rapidly according to a dose dependent manner compared with Q7R. incubation with Q7R or ribavirin up to 100 g/ml concentration for 48 h did not induce DNA fragmentation. infection with PEDV in the absence of Q7R resulted in a severe CPE. however, the addition of ribavirin in infected Vero cells was impossible to prevent CPE. morphology of cells was investigated under microscope and a photograph taken. a fluorescence probe, DCFH-DA, was added to the phosphate buffered-saline (pH 7.2) after harvest of vero cells infected with PEDV (MOI = 10) for the indicated time. a representative flow cytometry histogram of vero cells was shown. phosphate buffered-saline fluorescence probe DCFH-DA (20 M) was added to the phosphate buffered-saline (pH 7.2) after harvest of vero cells infected with PEDV at 6 h. representative images of ROS-induced DCF fluorescence of infected cell at 6 h post-infection. in the presence of Q7R, the DNA fragmentation was not induced in a dose-dependent manner. incubation with ribavirin of 100 g/ml did not induce DNA fragmentation. interference with this pathway by antioxidants is believed to inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and thus inhibit efficient virus multiplication. in contrast, there are also reports indicating that under certain conditions compounds act as a pro-apoptotic drug. authors' contributions 1JHS performed the exam wholly. 2HJC conceived of the study, and participated in its design and drafted the manuscript."}
