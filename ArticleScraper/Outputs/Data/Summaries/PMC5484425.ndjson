{"summary": "acute bronchiolitis (AB) is the most common acute lower respiratory system disease in infants. it is especially the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 6 months of age. AB is often caused by a viral infection. studies have recently researched the burden of respiratory viral tract infection agents in AB with larger groups. epidemiological, clinical, and risk factors of AB have also been defined. AB is frequent in infancy and there is an increase in admissions to hospitals and bronchiolitis-related morbidity. infants who were born prematurely were excluded from the study. Detailed demographic data including age, gender, smoke exposure, and epidemiological data were collected with a structured questionnaire. a prospective cross-sectional study of children younger than 24 months who were hospitalized with AB was conducted between October 2013 and October 2016. the diagnosis of AB was based on at least 2 of the following signs: chest retractions, tachypnea, wheezing or rales on auscultation. infants who were born prematurely were excluded from the study. a total of 316 infants hospitalized with AB were included in this prospective study. the most frequent age range of infants with AB was 1 to 6 months. nearly half of the infants diagnosed with AB were exposed to passive smoking. there was a history of atopy in 12% of all the infants. the most common complaint of the patients was cough (100%) the percentages were calculated by dividing the value over the total number of patients tested (N = 316) at least one respiratory virus was detected in 75% (237/316) of the cases at Ege University Children\u2019s Hospital. quadruple infections in 1/316 (0.3%) were detected. of the 81 infants with multiple agents, RSV (51 cases) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (n = 43, 53%), influenza virus (n = 18, 22.2%), human metapneumovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), adenovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), human bocavirus (n = 13, 16%), parainfluenza virus (n = 10, 12.3%), and human coron a total of 316 infants hospitalized with AB were included in this prospective study. the mean age was 7 6.5 months; 201 (63.6%) were male. most of the patients had cough and runny nose on admission to hospital. there was a history of atopy in 12% of all the infants. the most common complaint of the patients was cough (100%), and fever was present only in 88 (27.8%) of all the cases on admission to hospital. more than half of the infants had moderate bronchiolitis and the mean respiratory score was 5.3. 127 (40.1%) of the 316 infants hospitalized for AB. 76 (59.8%) were sole pathogen for RSV and 51 infants had RSV-coinfection. the second prevalent viral agent was rhinovirus, identified in 78 (24.6%) of subjects. the monthly incidence of bronchiolitis in infants due to common respiratory pathogens is shown in Figure 2. most cases were admitted to hospital in the winter time with a peak occurring in January, February, and March. several studies have shown that at least one respiratory viral pathogen was responsible for bronchiolitis in 75% of our cases. adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and rhinovirus have also been reported as possible pathogens causing AB. in recent years, new human respiratory viruses have also been reported as possible pathogens causing AB. human rhinoviruses are the most common human respiratory pathogens. they may also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections. rhinoviruses are known as a major pathogen for asthma exacerbations. the mortality rate of AB is low due to the fact that the infants are monitored by preventive measures such as palivizumab and improved health services. in the 1960s, it was reported that the mortality in infants less than 1 year of age diagnosed with bronchiolitis was 4% to 7% for those who were born prematurely and who had an underlying cardiopulmonary disease. the present study also emphasized the potential significance of other viruses such as influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and human coronavirus in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. author contributions G: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to analysis; drafted the manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy."}
