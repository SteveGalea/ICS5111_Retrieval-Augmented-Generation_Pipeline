{"summary": "all work described in this study was approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to the study. the study population comprised adult male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (24 female [age: range, 140 to 201 d; mean, 171 d]; 24 male [age: range, 114 to 167 d; mean, 137 d]; Brown Norway rats (24 female [age: range, 189 to 296 d; mean the colony was screened quarterly by indirect sentinels. at the time of the study, the colony was free of the following pathogens. the experiment was designed to control for the order of euthanasia. the rat in the induction cage was euthanized first, followed immediately by euthanasia of the rat in its home cage. for the other half of the rat pairs, the rat in the induction cage was euthanized first, followed immediately by euthanasia of the rat in its home cage. a cage was randomly assigned to treatment group by setting up a box for each sex. rats were removed from their chamber and terminal blood collection was performed through cardiac exsanguination, followed by bilateral pneumothorax to confirm euthanasia. the total number of rears, jumps, or digs was divided by the number of seconds from induction to nose down to obtain the number of rears, jumps, and digs per second. blood glucose was measured from a whole-blood sample by using a glucometer. serum corticosterone was measured by using a corticosterone rat/mouse ELISA kit. the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader set to 450 nm. the study population comprised adult male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. the rats were first-generation offspring from a study evaluating the effect of cage color on reproductive success. the rats were reared in the cage color-treatment environment until weaning at 21 d. the colony was screened quarterly by indirect sentinels. at the time of the study, the colony was free of the following pathogens. the experiment was designed to control for the order of euthanasia. for the other half of the rat pairs, the rat in the induction cage was euthanized first, followed immediately by euthanasia of the rat in its home cage. a cage was randomly assigned to treatment group by setting up a box for each sex, with 6 \u2018induction cage first, home cage second\u2019 and 6 \u2018home cage first, induction chamber second\u2019 tiles in each box. rats were observed from the initiation of the CO2 gas delivery until nose down. behavior was scored from induction until 'nose down', defined as the point when the head dropped and the nose of the rat touched the bottom of the cage. this behavioral parameter allowed approximation of the loss of righting reflex (within approximately 5 to 10 s),16. serum corticosterone was measured by using a corticosterone rat/mouse ELISA kit. the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader set to 450 nm by using SoftMax Pro 7.0. comparison of mean time to nose down showed no significant difference between euthanasia in the home cage compared with the induction chamber (F5,90 = 1.9942, P = 0.0870), but there was a significant interaction between the strain or stock and the order of treatment (P = 0.0162). Mean blood glucose differed significantly between treatments (F5,90 = 4.7406, P = 0.0007). time to nose down did not differ between euthanasia in the home cage compared with induction chamber (P = 0.1383) blood glucose showed no significant differences between treatment groups (P = 0.9960) with the blood glucose of males significantly higher as compared to females (P = 0.0162) there was no interaction between sex and treatment (P = 0.8159) or between sex and order (P = 0.3365). corticosterone was lower (P = 0.0033) in males (58.00 18.52 ng/mL) as compared with females (140.07 18.52 ng/mL) 49.14 10.71 (males) Noradrenaline (pg/mL) 261.06 73.44 197.25 73.44 P = 0.5420 No. of jumps (per second) 0.0011 0.0007 0.0006 0.0007 P = 0.6286 the mean frequency of rears differed between treatments (P 0.0001) and treatment order (P = 0.0116) rear frequency was higher in the rats euthanized in the induction chamber as compared with the home cage. in rats euthanized first in the induction chamber as compared with second, and in rats euthanized in the home cage as compared with second. x 10\"19 0.0004 0.0006 0.0004 P = 0.3225 No. of rears (per second) 0.091 0.007 0.038 0.007 P = 0.0262 All data are presented as mean SEM. all data were compared to identify significant differences between treatments, strain and stock. comparison of the mean rears frequency showed a significant difference in the overall model with significant increases in the induction chamber (P 0.0001) and in the Sprague Dawley rats (P = 0.0481) the mean rear frequency was greater for the rats in the induction chamber as compared with the home cage (P 0.0001). data from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats Induction chamber Home cage Comment Time to nose down (s) 68.58 1.24 65.63 1.24 P = 0.0990 Blood glucose (mg/dL) 93.21 6.15 93.25 6.15 P = 0.9962 With treatment groups combined, blood glucose was higher (P = 0.0149) in males (58.00 18.52 ng/mL) as compared with females (82.92 5.77 mg/dL data from brown Norway rats Treatment Induction chamber Home cage Comments Time to nose down (s) 65.46 0.80 67.58 0.80 P = 0.0677 Blood glucose (mg/dL) 71.33 3.11 69.42 3.11 P = 0.6650 Serum corticosterone (ng/mL) 154.74. corticosterone was lower (P = 0.0170) in males (116.45 18.23 ng/mL) as compared with females (180.32 18.23 ng/mL) noradrenaline was increased (P = 0.0013) in males (1374.16 208.04 pg/mL) as compared with females (2385.60 208.04 pg/mL) No jumps (per second) 1.08 x 10\" sex-associated differences observed in corticosterone and noradrenaline levels for rats in the current study are consistent with the existing literature. but the significant increases in the measured levels of noradrenaline in the Brown Norway rats were unexpected. the observed difference in noradrenaline could be due to the response to the hypercapnia induced by CO2.12,27,28. nor Sprague\u2013Dawley rats displayed digging behavior in the induction chamber. the observed rearing appeared consistent with the exploratory behavior associated with a new space. approximately 10% of rats repeatedly returned to the port and sniffed the 100% CO2 that was being introduced into the cage."}
