{"summary": "from 2003 through 2013, there have been more than 600 laboratory-confirmed human H5N1 cases and more than 300 deaths in 15 countries (6). from 2003 through 2013, there have been more than 600 laboratory-confirmed human H5N1 cases and more than 300 deaths in 15 countries (6). in 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 virus emerged in humans and caused the first influenza pandemic in 40 years. intranasally (i.n.) delivered LAIV elicit mucosal antibodies (Abs) and cellular immune responses as well as serum antibodies (26). the yield of LAIV doses in embryonated eggs is greater than that of inactivated influenza virus vaccines. two LAIV backbones are licensed for seasonal influenza in different parts of the world. several species of NHPs have previously been used to study AI virus infection and vaccine efficacy (35\u201338) africa green monkeys (AGMs) have been successfully used as NHP models for other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses. virus strains were generated by reverse genetics as described previously. the virus was propagated in 10-to-11-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. samples from two areas (distal and proximal) of each upper and lower lobe were collected at necropsy. samples from two areas (distal and proximal) of each upper and lower lobe were collected from each lung. tissues were frozen immediately after harvest and stored at 80\u00b0C. on MDCK cell monolayers, titers were expressed as TCID50 per gram or per ml. titers were expressed as TCID50 per gram or per ml, respectively. the monkeys were challenged with H5N1 wt or with H7N3 wt virus. bound antibodies were detected with biotinylated goat anti-monkey IgA (-chain) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. wells with an optical density (OD) of >0.2 after subtraction of background OD at 450 nm were considered positive results. sections were washed in PBS/FSG and then incubated with a primary Ab. sections were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) images were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope. composite images were generated using an Olympus DP70 camera. comparisons were excluded if the number of samples in the groups was 3 because of the small sample size. virus strains were generated by reverse genetics as described previously (32). a/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 (H9N2) ca (H9N2 ca) strain was generated by genetic reassortment (33). tissue samples, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, were collected at necropsy. samples from two areas (distal and proximal) of each upper and lower lobe were collected from each lung. sample collection was modified as results of earlier experiments became available. abs, nasal washes, or tracheal lavage fluid were titrated on MDCK cell monolayers. titers were expressed as TCID50 per gram or per ml, respectively. titers were expressed as TCID50 per gram or per ml, respectively. lectin histochemistry using linkage-specific lectins was carried out essentially as described by Kuchipudi et al. sections were washed in PBS containing 2% fish skin gelatin (FSG; Sigma) and then incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate. sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to rule out nonspecific binding of the lectins. images were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope. composite images were generated using Adobe Photoshop software. RESULTS Distribution of 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors. patchy MALI staining of ciliated epithelial cells continued into larynx, trachea, and bronchi. in the lung, MALI staining was present only on alveolar macrophages. binding of MALI was restricted to submucosal connective tissue and goblet cells of submucosal glands. double-label lectin histochemistry on lung shows MALII binding to type II pneumocytes in the alveoli. lectin histochemistry combined with immunofluorescence shows that SNA-expressing cells in the alveoli are VWF-positive endothelial cells. mocytes, lung sections were doubly labeled with SNA and either cytokeratin (type I pneumocytes) or Von Willebrand factor (VWF:endothelial cells) SNA colocalized exclusively with VWF, indicating that endothelial cells are the SA 2,6-Gal receptor-expressing cells in the alveolar walls. no signs of illness were observed in any of the animals that received any of the viruses, wild type (wt) or titers of 105.2, 104.3, and 102.2 TCID50/g on days 2, 4 and 7 respectively.

SA 2,6-Gal receptor expression was less prominent in the larynx and trachea. in the lung, SNA binding was seen in goblet cells of the main-stem bronchi, in alveolar macrophages. wt virus replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tract of AGMs. titers in the nasal turbinates and trachea peaked on day 2. titers in individual animals ranged from 102.0 to 106.5 TCID50/g.
