{"summary": "a set of 385 health personnel in charge of influenza pandemic preparedness in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand were asked to rank 33 statements about various issues of influenza pandemic. the Q factor analysis method was employed to identify patterns based on the similarity and dissimilarity among health personnel. an influenza pandemic is a significant natural health threat that has periodically occurred over the past 300 years. if the next pandemic occurs, it is expected that 20% of the global population will become ill, nearly 30 million will be hospitalized and a quarter of these would die within a few months of its attack. the world health organization (WHO) has recommended that all countries should consider this threat as very important. this unrest has led to the loss of over 2,600 lives and more than 7,000 injuries in the past 5 years. the current report is confined to perceptions related to the threat of an influenza pandemic. it is hoped understanding their patterns of perception will allow control programs to properly improve the training. the study subjects are then asked to rank the representative statements and place them into a score sheet. this is known as the Q sorting procedure. the sheets that are completely ranked by each subject (Q-sort) are finally correlated and analyzed by Q factor analysis. health personnel designated by each facility to be responsible for influenza pandemic preparedness were identified. the selected personnel were sent a set of documents, a set of 33 statements (Q sample), a standardized step-by-step set of instructions for responding to the study, and a score sheet. each participant was asked to place two statements in the columns of strongly disagree (-4) and strongly agree (-3) and agree (-3), four in -2 and +2, five in -1 and +1, and five statements variables that could explain more than 5% of variance were adopted and retained into the final solution. a participant who had absolute factor loadings of larger than 0.45, which suggests high significance (p 0.01) with the group, was included into that particular factor. each final score sheet thus displays the pattern of the defined factor. the flow of communication surrounding the study topic is firstly formed to get a wide range of ideas toward that topic. a representative set of statements is selected from the concourse and developed to be more meaningful. the study subjects are then asked to rank the representative statements and place them into a score sheet. this is known as the Q sorting procedure. participants were randomly assigned a number from 1 to 33 for the subjects to arrange and place into the score sheet. the statements were pilot-tested with 25 health personnel and then revised as appropriate before the study. the study was conducted in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. each Q-sort was considered complete if all 33 statements were placed in the score sheet without repetition of the statements. a participant who had absolute factor loadings of larger than 0.45, which suggests high significance (p 0.01) with the group, was included into that particular factor. statement 3 emphasizes avian influenza, statement 14 natural and inevitable threat, and 22 on proximity to the threat. statements 11 and 19 measure different domains of the PMT. statement 19 represents self-efficacy (SE) measures (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) must be performed during an influenza pandemic event to reduce the impacts (RE) 4 4 4 10 I perceive that an influenza pandemic can cause excess of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (S) 1 -2 0 11 I perceive that efficient influenza pandemic preparedness is the responsibility of every level from national to community both governmental and private sectors. an influenza pandemic can cause great psychosocial disruption (S) -2 0 -2 25 I have confidence that Thailand has the chance to use influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs when an influenza pandemic occurs (SE) -2 0 -2 27 I have confidence that influenza vaccines have the highest efficiency in reducing the impacts of an influenza pandemic (RE) -3 2 -1 30 I have confidence that influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs will be enough provided for everyone if and when an influenza pande the non-responders had a lower educational level than those of the responders. the basic characteristics of the 271 respondents are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Basic characteristics of the respondents Variable Number (n = 271) % Sex Male 148 54.6 Female 123 45.4 Age Mean(SD) 37.4 (8.3) Job classification Public health specialist 92 33.9 Public health administrator 51 18.8 Junior health worker 50 18.4 Nurse 39 14.4 Doctor 14 5.2 Pharmacist 11 4.1 Laboratory personnel 9 3.3 Other statement 1 is in column +2 of Figure 2, column -1 of Figure 3, and column -4 of Figure 4. all three patterns of health personnel strongly perceived multi-measures must be performed during an influenza pandemic. statement 4 was the most dissenting issue with factor scores of 3, -4, and 0. pattern I was pessimistic (strongly perceived response efficacy, but perceived low severity and low self-efficacy) pattern III was mixed (strongly perceived response efficacy, but perceived low severity and low self-efficacy) a high perception on response efficacy was predominantly found in all health personnel groups. more than half of local health workers may be unwilling to report to duty during a pandemic event. however, that study did not identify different patterns of health workers as our study has done. a low level of self efficacy among the respondents was also low. the study was confined to the three southernmost provinces of Thailand where avian influenza A (H5N1) has never occurred. our study subjects might be different from those in other regions of the country where the infected cases of that avian influenza in both humans and poultry have been reported. this study was part of the first author's thesis to fulfill the requirement for PhD in Epidemiology at Prince of Songkla University (PSU). the study was part of the first author's thesis to fulfill the requirement for PhD in Epidemiology."}
