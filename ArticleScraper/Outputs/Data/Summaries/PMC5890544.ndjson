{"summary": "the respiratory diseases resulting from these viral infections represent one of the main causes of death in developing countries. a more thorough understanding of respiratory viruses, their epidemiology, as well as medical impact on the communities they affect will delineate the path toward eventual treatments and abatement of the illnesses. over 85% of acute respiratory viral infections in critically ill children were caused by either a picornavirus, RSV, PIV, or HMPV. other DNA viruses such as adenovirus can be the source of respiratory infections. influenza is a (\u2013)ssRNA virus and a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family. there are four influenza genera within this family, called A, B, C, or D. the highest incidence of influenza infection occurs in younger patients (25 years old) influenza outbreaks are most prevalent in the winter, but some viruses such as PIV persist year-round. human PIV has four types (1 to 4) and was known historically to induce respiratory complications mainly in children. up to one-third of the nearly 5 million annual cases of lower respiratory tract infection in children is at least partially due to PIVs. studies on italy showed a range of infection from 7% to 40% depending on the year. symptoms include cough, fever, sneezing, nasal congestion, sore throat, fever, and headache. enteroviruses infect a wide range of cell types. EV71 is most prevalent in the summer months and tends to be more ubiquitous in tropical zones of the globe. respiratory illness can lead to pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and lung failure. presently, six HCoV are recognized: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and the well-known SARS and MERS CoV. adults are the target population for both SARS and MERS with a median age range of 39\u201350 years. the clinical features of both SARS and MERS range from mild to severe respiratory illness, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, and diarrhea. the latter displaying a more lethal pneumonia and renal failure. adults are the target population for both SARS and MERS. the clinical features range from mild to severe respiratory illness, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, and diarrhea. of the 2040 confirmed cases of MERS, 35% were fatal. antiviral nucleosides compete with natural nucleoside triphosphates to bind to the active site of viral polymerases. the nucleotide binding site of these proteins is usually well conserved among virus families. the polymerase of influenza virus is a (\u2013)ssRNA virus. influenza polymerase is composed of three subunits that yield a 270 kDa heterotrimeric complex. the longest viral RNA segments encode for the PA protein, PB1 and PB2, which assemble to form the influenza polymerase complex. the polymerase transcribes viral RNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then replicates it using a complementary RNA intermediate. the PB2 domain has a key exterior positively charged residue at the 627 position within a flexible loop that partially wraps around an alpha helix to form what is known as a phi-loop. a signature structural element is the conserved P[F/P]AAAPP motif on the N-terminal side of the 627 residue that is part of the alpha helix previously described. the PB1 possesses a -hairpin loop within motif E from residues 641 to 657 in the thumb subdomain of influenza A. biochemical investigations have shown that this priming loop may serve as a platform for the initial NTP on the 3\u2032 end of the template and ensure against double-stranded RNA. influenza enzyme are unclear, the endonuclease activity is strongly activated by metal ion binding through hydrolysis of ssDNA and ssRNA substrates. the viral genome has eight segments in influenza A and B and seven segments in influenza C and D. the PB2 subunit has an N-terminal domain (PB2-N) from residues 1 to 247 and a C-terminal domain (PB2-C) from residues 248 to 760. the PB2-C includes several notable structural features and subdomains. the PB1 domain is at the center of the polymerase complex and within its center is a classic right-handed shape. these subdomains are described as conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) motifs pre-A/F and A-E. the finger and palm are covered by a linker connecting the two subdomains of PA. the subunit was expressed in insect cells to reveal an N-terminal third (PA-Nter) and a C-terminal two-thirds (PA-Cter) subdomains. the catalytic residues for endonuclease activity reside in the PA domain, not in the PB1 subunit as originally thought. the genome of RSV is approximately 15 kilobases long and is transcribed into capped and poly-adenylated mRNAs. the genome is replicated starting at the leader promoter in a processive manner to yield a positive sense antigenome RNA. core RSV polymerase consists of a 250 kDa large (L) protein of approximately 2000 amino acids and a 27 kDa phosphoprotein (P) that synthesizes an RNA product upon the addition of an RNA template. the P protein is thought to act as a chaperone to aid in the stability and expression of the polymerase. a homology-model of the RdRp domain of the HMPV L protein shows a right-handed fold with structural similarities to VSV. the three-dimensional structure of the methyltransferase (green) and C-terminal (blue) domains of the HMPV L protein shows a right-handed fold with structural similarities to VSV. the second part of the reaction consists of the MTase reaction, which uses S-adenosylmethionine to methylate nitrogen 7 and the 2\u2032-oxygen of the cap. a recent crystal structure of the MTase domain from HMPV has provided additional clues into this reaction. the 3Dpol uses a small viral peptide (VPg) to initiate plus and minus RNA synthesis in vivo. the 3Dpol is located at the C-terminal end of a longer viral polyprotein of approximately 250 kDa. the structures of 3Dpol have been solved for EV71, HRV16, and PV. the fingers subdomain makes an important contact with the thumb subdomain and pushes the ring finger down to trap it. an additional structural feature of motif F is a positively charged tunnel that modulates the interactions of NTP. the tunnel is conserved among this family of viruses. the coV genome has a 5\u2032-cap, is polyadenylated on the 3\u2032end, and generates a total of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) the 5\u2032 two-thirds of its genome encodes for non-structural proteins that combine to form a replication and transcription complex that completes viral RNA synthesis. conserved aspartates found in motif A of SARS-CoV contribute to the polymerase and RNA synthesis activities. this is different from other positive strand RNA viruses which contain a GDD active site. motif C along with motif C aid in coordinating the metal ions necessary for catalysis. the addition of nsp7 and nsp8 to nsp12 appears to activate and increase the processivity of the polymerase allowing it to produce an RNA synthesis product of 340 nucleotides in the presence of Mg2+. nsp14 contains an exoribonuclease domain that has been shown to decrease nucleotide mismatch. ribavirin is currently approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in combination therapy and against severe RSV infection in monotherapy. ribavirin is administered as a small-particle aerosol that requires use of a mask and a tent. it was originally developed against influenza based on its efficacy in a mouse model of influenza. o-cytidine and adenosine analogs containing a methyl group at the 2\u2032-position on the ribose are known inhibitors of HCV and other related members of the Flaviviridae family. 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine (7DMA, MK-0608), was once a development candidate for the treatment of HCV infection. NITD008 cannot be developed in the clinic due to severe toxicity seen in 14-day studies in rats and dogs. nucleoside analogs targeting the viral RNA polymerase of rhinovirus have the potential to be efficacious in preclinical animal models. treatment with 2\u2032FdG at 20 mg/kg starting 1 h post-infection significantly reduced H3N2 influenza A virus titers in nasal washes, associated with reduction in fever and inflammation. more direct evidence for the mechanism of action came from enzyme inhibition studies. a low organ exposure of the phosphorylated metabolite of 2\u2032FdC could limit the toxic effect on dividing cells in these animals. the antiviral 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide (T-705, favipiravir, AVIGAN) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza infection since 2014. the antiviral potency of T-705 covers other viruses unrelated to influenza. this includes representatives of noroviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, and filoviruses. the mutagenic effect of T-705 has also been documented for HCV. ALS-8176 (lumicitabine) was the parent molecule of the prodrug ALS-8176. the main scaffold identified from this screen was 2\u2032difluoro-4\u2032azido-cytidine. further modifications at the 2\u2032- and 4\u2032 positions to improve anti-RSV potency led to the identification of ALS-8112. a series of 2\u2032,3\u2032-diester prodrugs was evaluated for improved pharmacokinetic properties. one prodrug formed high levels of monophosphate and triphosphate in the lungs. at the end of treatment, RSV RNA was undetectable in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from all four ALS-8176-treated animals. GS-441524, or compound 4) was moderately active against Ebola replication with EC50 values around 1.5 M. the 1\u2032-methyl and -ethynyl counterparts were completely inactive. GS-441524 is also a broad-spectrum inhibitor of a variety of RNA viruses from four families. GS-5734 was administered at a daily intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. it was first given as a 14-day course for compassionate use to an Ebola-infected nurse who had survived the disease. a neonate who had congenital Ebola virus infection received three different experimental therapies, including a 12-day treatment with GS-5734. novel nucleoside analogs against respiratory viruses have been tested without success. the concept of nucleoside analogs against respiratory viruses remains relatively new and needs to be further explored. there is no clear mechanistic basis to explain why none of these compounds inhibit (\u2013)ssRNA viruses, or even other (+)ssRNA viruses such as coV. some hypotheses have not been tested due to the difficulty to conduct biochemical and structural studies on viral polymerases from respiratory viruses. the prospect of developing nucleoside analogs directed against respiratory infections represents an exciting new avenue in antiviral research. the author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}
