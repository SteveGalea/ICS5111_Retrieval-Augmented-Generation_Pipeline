{"summary": "the quality control department of a medicinal product manufacturing plant has the aim to guarantee the quality of the product. safety derives from the demonstration that the product does not contain adventitious agents: bacteria, fungi, and viruses. purity demonstrates that the cell therapy product contains at high concentration the active substance and is free from unwanted cell populations. validation protocol should define the roles and the responsibilities of each person and element involved in the validation performance. the ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines define the following parameters that should be considered for validation: accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, and range. validation is expected for clinical ATMPs in advanced experimental phases. the aim of this paper is to give a clear explanation of how we designed validation of compendial and noncompendial methods to determine safety for quality control of GMP. all the results and the analysis were recorded in a report approved by the Responsible of Quality Control (RQC) department. if the validation criteria were not met, the RQC managed this condition as a \u201cnoncompliance,\u201d identified and corrected the causes for failure, and rescheduled the validation activities. s t a n d d e v i a t i o n m e a n 100 is the lowest amount of analyte in a sample which can be detected but not necessarily quantitated as an exact value. the correlation coefficient R square (R2) is between 1 and 0.9. nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 80% confluence, the cells were detached using 25 mL/layer of TrypLE-Select (Gibco, Life Technologies) at each passage, MSC were washed and cryopreserved with 10% DMSO (CRYOSERV, mylan Institutionals, Canonsburg, PA, USA) lyophilized bacterial strains, yeast, and fungus were appropriately prepared and isolated in casein soybean Digest Agar and Sabouraud, right-agar plates. for use, they were recultivated in agar plates in specific conditions. each batch of culture medium was tested for sterility and fertility. analysis was carried out for direct inoculation into the microbial culture medium. the minimum volume to be tested is 1% on the maximum volume of the batch. for each microbial strain, two levels of contamination were obtained: 1\u201310 CFU and 10\u2013100 CFU. the samples were incubated at 35\u201337\u00b0C for 14 days. positive controls were carried out by adding only the microorganisms. negative controls were performed by adding the sample to culture media only. chromogenic kinetic method (method D, Ph. Eur. 2.6.14) was used for bacterial endotoxin determination. chromogenic kinetic method (method D, Ph. Eur. 2.6.14) is a portable spectrophotometric microplate reader equipped with a thermostatically controlled incubation chamber. the standard curve has been performed on each batch of CSE, with three endotoxin concentrations within specified range on three replicates for each concentration. the linearity of the standard curve, given by the absolute value of R2, must be 0.980. negative control was represented by LAL reagent water (Charles River) in at least two replications. onset time of negative control and no spiked samples must be greater than the onset time of, the percentage of CV must be 10%. assay designed to detect respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, and bronchoalveolar lavage was chosen. three batches of reference cryopreserved CBMSC were thawed, counted, and prepared in three different cell doses (0.1, 0.5, and 1 106 cells) amplification was done adding 8 L of extract to 17 L of different master mix according to manufacturer's instructions. the kit contains two different controls: the first one is the PCR control (PCRC) that allows to verify if the whole process has happened correctly without inhibition by substances contained in the samples. 359 and 1436 copies for CMV, 656 and 1313 copies for EBV, 362 and 723 copies for adenovirus (AdV), and 362 and 723 copies for enterovirus (HEV) three different batches of CBMSC were charged with a viral load tenfold over the sensitivity cutoff declared by the manufacturer. reference samples of MSC were resuspended in a volume between 1 and 20 mL of PBS. the cells were pretreated with a buffer of lysis (ChemoMetec) the cell stock solution was then serially diluted (1 : 2\u20131 : 4\u20131 : 8\u20131 : 16) and counted with the two methods. the validation design for the immunophenotyping analysis was preceded by a preliminary phase consisting of, at first, the titration of each antibody used and then the instrument settings. the validation phase consisted in the evaluation of the parameters in compliance with ICH Q2. MSC per 100 L were stained for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark with the following antibodies. CD90 PE-Cy7 (BD), CD105 PerCP-Cy 5.5 (BD), and CD75 APC (BD) after incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, and analyzed with the DIVA software program (BD). negative standard of stMSC (n = 3) was combined with negative standard stK562 in 9 different ratios. each preparation (n = 18 total tubes) was stained for CD90, CD105, CD73, and CD45 as described above. validation strategy was described in detail in the validation protocol that reported the chosen ICH Q2 (R1) parameters [4], the type of analysis, the number of runs and replicates, the formulas used for calculation, the acceptance criteria, the instruments, the operators involved, and the time schedule for the completion of the validation study. if the validation criteria were not met, the RQC managed this condition as a \u201cnoncompliance\u201d. precision was considered at two levels: repeatability (intra-assay precision) and intermediate precision (interassay precision) it was calculated by considering the percentage of the coefficient of variation (CV) between the series of measurements, calculated by the formula: s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n m e a n 100. nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (Macopharma) at 80% confluence, the cells were detached using 25 mL/layer of TrypLE-Select. at each passage, MSC were washed and cryopreserved with 10% DMSO. lyophilized bacterial strains, yeast, and fungus were appropriately prepared and isolated in casein soybean Digest Agar (CASO Agar) and Sabouraud, right-agar plates. each batch of culture medium was tested for sterility and fertility. microbiological Contamination Microbiological strains (ATCC Manassas, VA, USA) were chosen in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.6.27 [13, 14], at the version in use at the moment of validation. each batch of culture medium was tested for sterility and fertility before use according to Ph. Eur. 2.6.27. the matrix solution for CBMSC as a cryopreserved product is made of normal saline, HSA, and DMSO at the concentration described above. the BMMSC as fresh product was resuspended in HSA and normal saline (5% vol : vol) the validation scheme and the evaluated parameters are displayed. bacterium acnes, Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus and Yersinia enterocolitica and soyabean casein digest medium were incubated at 35\u201337\u00b0C for 14 days. positive controls were carried out by adding only the microorganisms in the absence of product. negative controls were performed by adding the sample to culture media only. onset time Precision CV (intra-assay) 10% Sensitivity chosen dilution Adventitious viruses analysis ICHQ3/ICHQ5A(R1) Preliminary phase Cell number, extraction, and amplification conditions setup No inhibition on extraction and amplification for respiratory, CMV, and EBV viruses. the kit usually used for standard biological diagnostic samples MSC spiked with two viral loads of adenovirus, enterovirus, CMV, and EBV. the standard curve has been performed on each batch of CSE. the standard curve has been performed on each batch of CSE. the linearity of the standard curve, given by the absolute value of R2, must be 0.980. the cellular product was diluted in water LAL with a minimum volume of 100 L. for each dilution, 25 L of testing sample was charged in the four wells of a cartridge. the negative control was represented by LAL reagent water in at least two replications. three batches of reference cryopreserved CBMSC were thawed, counted, and prepared in three different cell doses. the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer ATL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and DNA and RNA were extracted using an automatic extractor EZ1 (Qiagen) in a final volume of 120 L. only a standard curve with R2 > 0.9 was accepted. amplification was done adding 8 L of extract to 17 L of different master mix according to manufacturer's instructions. culated to the cells, we used as positive standards a representative DNA virus (adenovirus) and a RNA virus (enterovirus) the viral quantities used to spike the cells were comparable of a low and high viral load in a positive patient sample. samples spiked with HEV were performed with or without proteinase K treatment. nucleocounter is a portable device based on integrated fluorescence microscope principle. reference samples of MSC were resuspended in a volume between 1 and 20 mL of PBS. for the first, cells were pretreated with a buffer of lysis. the cell stock solution was then serially diluted (1 : 2\u20131 : 4\u20131 : 8\u20131 : 16) and counted with the two methods. the validation design for the immunophenotyping analysis was preceded by a preliminary phase consisting of the titration of each antibody used and then the instrument settings. the validation phase consisted in the evaluation of the parameters in compliance with ICH Q2. 1 105 MSC per 100 L were stained for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark with the following antibodies at different concentrations (0, 1, 2.5, and 5 L) after incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, and analyzed with the DIVA software program. a minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed. negative standard of stMSC (n = 3) was combined with negative standard stK562 in 9 different ratios. each preparation (n = 18 total tubes) was stained for CD90, CD105, CD73, and CD45. the same paragraph 2.6.27 in the more recent edition of Ph. Eur. aims to facilitate the use of sterility analytical methods by including alternative approaches. other products, such as BMMSC, must be released as fresh products and requires alternative approaches for validation and testing. for validation purposes, we tested 10 mL of final product for each microorganism strain. sterility testing was validated on a thawed retention sample contained in a cryopreservation bag as the final product. the sample must be thawed and tested for sterility within three weeks. the main changes to previous version concern a greater flexibility for the incubation temperature(s), a change in the list of microorganisms to be tested. automated sterility testing is capable of rapidly detecting low-level contamination, with an average of 2.5 days [18] and within 48 hours [19] for different biopharmaceutical and transplantation products. the validation design was to verify the suitability of the reagents and specifically the sensitivity of the CSE. a central value corresponded to the amount of endotoxin loaded as positive control in the cartridge itself and that the last value corresponded to sensitivity. the validation on the product must be performed with several purposes: (1) to identify possible interference by the product itself, (2) to show that the chosen dilution does not interfere, and (3) to eliminate the possible sources of interference by different means (e the EL and MVD in our conditions were calculated as follows: E L = K M. (4) where K is 5 EU/kg (as requested by Ph. Eur. for parenteral administration) and M is the maximum cellular dose infused per kilogram in a single-hour period that in our condition is the maximum volume of infusion per kilogram. for CBMSC, the maximum volume infused considering a standard adult body weight of 70 kg in 1-hour period is 80 mL. the chosen sample dilutions were 1 : 30; 1 : 90; and 1 : 180. the results obtained were satisfied for all the three dilutions of the product. it was decided to use the lowest dilution of 1 : 30 in the next phase. new frontiers in the application of LAL to ATMPs are represented by the development of alternative methods for complex tissue-engineered products. alternative methods have recently been proposed such as cell-based assays that are able to detect material-bound microbial contaminations not detectable with LAL test. most of the commercial kits are validated for specific diagnostic use, in biological material such as blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage. in order to evaluate the best conditions for extraction and amplification, we tested three thawed batches of CBMSC at different cell doses. the samples spiked with HEV were treated (_1) or not (_2) with protease K. positive controls (CTRLs +) were represented by virus alone. a PCR internal control (PCRC) and a whole process control (WPC) were visible in set A and set C. the accuracy error (Ea) by comparing the virus \u201cquantity\u201d for each batch of CBMSC and of the CMV-and EBV-positive controls was satisfied. the acceptance criteria (20 accuracy error +20) were satisfied. the coefficients of variation within technical replicates were 20%. dilution experiments show that both the automated and manual methods maintain a good linearity even at low cell concentrations. the manual method appears to be less precise than the automated one as shown by CV in terms of repeatability and intermediate precision. othelial surface markers such as CD14, CD45, CD34, CD11b, HLA-DR, and CD31 are still used as accepted standards to define MSC for clinical application. Flow cytometry represents the most widely used method for immunophenotypic analysis also in GMP settings. however, assessment of the analytical measurement as sensitivity and linearity is affected by the lack of cellular reference materials and the difficulty in obtaining adequate controls. a standardized protocol for MSC purity with the certainty to be able to detect less than 5% of impurities. linearity (a, d), intra-assay (b, e), and interassay (c, f) evaluation for expression of purity (percentage of CD90/CD105+ positive cells) in (a\u2013c) graphs and impurity (percentage of CD45+ positive cells) in (d\u2013f) images. the sample into test media as described in Ph. Eur. Chapter 2.6.27 that fits specifically with cell products while the membrane filtration method described in Ph. Eur. Chapter 2.6.1. may present difficulties when applied to cells. the main challenge of this validation was to define the most representative sample of the final product, in terms of volume and conditions (fresh versus cryopreserved) isms was observed in the presence and in the absence of the cell product (positive controls) for all the three validation runs, thus indicating that the product does not possess intrinsic antibacterial activity. the limit of detection was 1\u201310 CFU, as requested. we are also validating a rapid sterility testing with the aim to demonstrate that it is accurate, sensitive, and specific. the test is the most sensitive and specific test currently available to detect and measure bacterial endotoxins, defined as \u201cpyrogens\u201d as they induce fever and other adverse reactions caused by inflammatory mediators. the reaction time of the sample is compared with that of control standard endotoxins (CSE) EL and MVD must be calculated for each specific product as described in Materials and Methods. for new medicinal product, EL and MVD must be calculated by the user. but there are still no defined guidelines that explain the rational to be followed to define these values. standard adult body weight of 70 kg in 1-hour period is 10 mL. therefore, EL for BMMSC is E L = 5 E U / k g 0.14 m L / k g = 35.7 E U / m L. the product was tested at different dilutions, in order to identify the most suitable noninterfering dilution. c h o s e n d i l u t i o n = 0.005 E U / m L 30 = 0.15 E U / m L 30 = 0.15 E U / m L 30. sensitivity of the test is much higher than that of the EL to be confident in the detection of the endotoxins. adventitious Viruses Analysis Validation ATMP production carries the risk of adventitious virus contamination. the compendial guidelines Q5 ICH [23] concern products derived from in vitro cell culture, including interferons, monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant DNA-derived products. 0.1 106 BMMSC and the same dose of CBMSC were inoculated with a low and high viral load of CMV, EBV, enterovirus (HEV) and adenovirus (AdV) in all the samples, the band of the internal control (PCRC) and that of the whole process control (WPC) were present. the treatment at 56\u00b0C with the proteinase K does not inhibit the RNA extraction. plasmid (standard) was plotted with Ct of positive controls and spiked MSC. the results obtained for respiratory viruses, CMV, and EBV were also consistent with the sensitivity declared by the manufacturer. the results obtained for respiratory viruses, CMV, and EBV were also consistent with the sensitivity declared by the manufacturer. rizzani et al [5] performed validation of a flow cytometry method. the automated method allows the count of global and viable total nucleated cells (TNC) in comparison to Burker chamber. the accuracy calculated as accuracy error was within the range of the acceptance criteria 5/+5. Flow cytometry represents the most widely used method for immunophenotypic analysis also in GMP settings. Flow cytometry represents the most widely used method for immunophenotypic analysis also in GMP settings. however, assessment of the analytical measurement as sensitivity and linearity is affected by the lack of cellular reference materials. topoietic markers spike MSC with different concentrations of a hematopoietic line (K562) that has similar dimension/scatter to MSC. results showed that, for both purity and impurity, we obtained a good linearity in all the experiment sets. the calculated CV is less than 5% for repeatability (Figures 5(b) and 5(e)) and less than 10% for intermediate precision (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)) the first approved in italy in 2007, it was a significant breakthrough to find the way towards efficient and rational validation approaches for the ongoing and future clinical applications. here, we summarized the most critical validation methods to define cellular safety, identity, and purity in the early phases of clinical trials."}
