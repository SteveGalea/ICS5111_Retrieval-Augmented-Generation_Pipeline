{"summary": "the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections from each aerosol-generating procedure has not been fully determined. the objective of the report was to answer the following research question: what is the clinical evidence for the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections to health care workers caring for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. procedures that showed a statistically significant increased risk of SARS transmission to health care workers included tracheal intubation, non-invasive tracheotomy, and manual ventilation before intubation. the risk of transmission associated with suction before intubation, suction after intubation, manual ventilation after intubation, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, oxygen mask manipulation, biPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) mask manipulation, defibrillation, four studies included fewer than 100 patients. the number of health care workers who were exposed to aerosol-generating procedures was small. the sample size of the studies could limit statistical power. associations included non-invasive ventilation from two studies. manual ventilation before intubation and tracheotomy each from single studies. findings must be interpreted in context of the very low quality of the studies."}
