{"summary": "lncRNAs are categorized as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not contain a significant open reading frame but are often polyadenylated and spliced. the genomic origin of lncRNAs is manifold, including intergenic, intronic, gene-overlapping, or antisense transcription. several mouse lncRNAs were similarly regulated upon infection with IAV, a highly contagious virus causing annual epidemics and frequent pandemic outbreaks. genome-wide studies have aimed to identify host cell proteins necessary for productive IAV replication. lincRNAs are differentially expressed during influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1). lncRNAs are differentially expressed during influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (MOI 1) for 8 or 24 h. re-annotated arrays investigated potential infection-induced changes to lncRNA expression patterns at 8 h and 24 h post-infection. expression of the known antiviral genes myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and 2\u2019-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) was upregulated on microarrays, which confirmed successful infection in this system. IFN-inducible genes were differentially regulated following incubation with UV-treated supernatants. but lncRNA expression, including the subset of 17 lincRNAs induced 8 h and 24 h p.i., was not affected. infection-induced expression of novel lincRNA is not specific to A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. qRT-PCR time course investigations over 8 h suggested that infection-induced expression of VIN increased during late infection. in line with initial investigations at 6 h p.i., IBV infection failed to induce VIN expression at all time points investigated. treatment with IFN at a range of concentrations did not induce VIN expression. however, upregulation of the known IFN target gene, MX1, was successfully demonstrated in this system. this induction is likely to be a specific response and not due the presence of viral RNA itself. VIN is encoded by two exons and contains a 3\u2032-polyadenylation signal. this algorithm takes multiple features such as peptide length, amino acid composition, secondary structure, and protein homology into consideration. a highly folded secondary structure predicted a highly folded secondary structure with several hairpin loops. unlike GAPDH mRNA, VIN was largely insensitive to endonuclease A (RNase A) digestion. this supported the idea that VIN adopts stable secondary structures. the specificity of RNA-FISH was determined via hybridization of probes targeting nuclear RNU1-1 and ubiquitously distributed GAPDH mRNA (Fig. S8A, panels 1 and 2). a control condition without applying any probe showed that signals detected in the Cy2 channel were not influenced by simultaneous staining of viral nucleoprotein (NP) with Cy3. VIN is essential for productive A/WSN/33 virus infection in human lung epithelial cells. three unique siRNAs designed to target VIN were used individually (1, 2, and 3) and collectively (P) to transfect. immunofluorescence images shown are representatives from at least three independent experiments. NP-positive MDCK cells from infection experiments were quantified using ScanR software. data are presented as mean A/WSN/33 (H1N1) viral titers. microarrays were uniformly annotated to enable cross-platform comparison. re-annotation revealed the relative contributions of different ncRNA classes to ncRNA probes on these microarrays. the expression of the known antiviral genes myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and 2\u2019-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) was upregulated on microarrays. the transcription of 42 ncRNAs common to both microarrays was up- or downregulated at least 2-fold upon infection. the most abundantly represented class was lincRNAs. non-coding transcript ENST00000412690 was among the most highly induced lincRNAs in the microarray analyses. two additional IAV strains were selected, one IBV strain and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) levels of VIN expression in cells infected with the IAV strains A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) increased approximately 30\u2013 IBV infection failed to induce VIN expression at all time points investigated. qRT-PCR data are presented as mean fold-changes in VIN expression (+/ SD) compared with non-infected (NI) reference. VIN expression was induced upon infection with a number of IAV viruses. however, viral RNA mimics, or IFN are not able to induce VIN. this induction is likely to be a specific response and not due the presence of viral RNA itself. VIN encoded by two exons and contains a 3\u2032-polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) shown in silico characterization of VIN. lncRNA secondary structure predicts a highly folded secondary structure. RNA fractionation experiments revealed that VIN was more abundant in the nuclear RNA fraction of A549 cells compared with the cytoplasmic fraction. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) was performed to further investigate the subcellular localization of VIN. a control condition without applying any probe showed that signals detected in the Cy2 channel were not influenced by simultaneous staining of viral nucleoprotein (NP) with Cy3. knockdown of VIN by siRNAs decreased the nuclear DIG signal (Fig. S8B), confirming the specificity of RNA-FISH probes. viral titers of the titrated cell supernatants were calculated according to infectivity rates. knockdown with three different siRNAs individually and in conjunction reduced viral titers more than 10-fold compared with Allstars siRNA-treated control cells. Western blot analysis of IAV protein expression 48 h p.i. in VIN A549 siRNA knockdown cells compared with siRNA Allstars control. lincRNA VIN is an essential player during IAV replication. we identified VIN as differentially expressed during influenza A/WSN/33 virus infection using NCodeTM and SureprintTM G3 microarrays. dynamic changes in expression levels of lncRNAs have been identified upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages. lncRNAs have been implicated in the maintenance of sub-nuclear architecture,40 direct transcriptional regulation,41 post-transcriptional control,42 and chromatin remodeling. however, it remains to be demonstrated which function VIN conducts in the nucleus of IAV-infected cells. lncRNAs repressing antiviral or enhancing proviral gene expression might aid in supporting viral replication. the Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, CCL-34, ATCC-LGC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 4 mM l-glutamine and 10% FCS. influenza virus strains A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 RNA labeling was performed with the Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies) mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer. cRNA was subsequently labeled with Cyanine 3-CTP or Cyanine 5-CTP. probe sequences covered 3415 and 3201 unique ncRNAs on NCodeTM and SureprintTM G3 respectively.
