{"summary": "EV71 is an RNA icosahedral virus that belongs to the human enterovirus species A of the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae family (1, 2). EV71 is thought to be one of the main pathogens that cause foot, hand, and mouth disease (HFMD) in young children (3, 4). over one million EV71-related HFMD cases were reported each year in china since 2008. l-w, Mcl-1, Bfl-1, and Bcl-XL contain all four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1 to -4) (17, 18) the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax possess BH1 to BH3 and are required for the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway (20, 21) many viruses encode proapoptotic proteins that target crucial components within the apoptotic cascade to induce apoptosis at the end of their replication cycles. many viruses also encode antiapoptotic proteins to evade or delay the early onset of apoptosis. EV71 infection induces classic signs of apoptosis, such as the efflux of Cyt c from mitochondria and subsequent cleavage of caspase-9. mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis mediated by activation and cleavage of caspase-9 has been proven to be a main pathway in EV71-induced apoptosis (42). the full-length human cDNA for Bcl-XL was cloned into the restriction site of the pcDNA3.0-HA plasmid. the recombinant plasmid or pcDNA3.0-HA was then transfected into HeLa cells by using the Fu-GENE transfection reagent. s, and mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, used in immunofluorescence studies and Western blot analyses, were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, mitochondria were resuspended in 70 mM sucrose and 10 mM N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES)-KOH. the osmotic strength was adjusted to 0.3 M sucrose, and after a 20-min incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 18,000 g for 15 min. pelleted mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 g for 10 min. mitochondria were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. cross-linking was quenched in a quenching solution at a final concentration of 30 mM. 000 was incubated for 5 min at RT and was then incubated with the siRNA (50 nM) or recombinant plasmid (2 g/ml) for 10 min at RT. at 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed, and analyses were performed at the indicated time after transfection. Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and immunoprecipitation were performed. EV71 genomic RNA was extracted from the supernatant of virus-infected RD cells using a virus genome extraction kit. single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the purified virus RNA by reverse transcription. a complementary oligonucleotide of 2B(22\u201335) was chemically synthesized and used to produce DNA duplexes. caspase-3 activity was assayed in triplicates by measuring release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (AFC) from synthetic peptides. aliquots of cell supernatants were incubated with 200 l of reaction buffer, 5 l of EDVD-AFC substrate, and dithiothreitol (DTT) human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and human cervical (HeLa) cells were propagated and maintained in either modified Eagle's medium or double modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics. the full-length human cDNA for Bcl-XL was cloned into the restriction site of the pcDNA3.0-HA plasmid after digesting with EcoRI/NotI. xNT (recognizing both native and activated Bax), Bid, Bim, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Cox IV, mitochondrial outer membrane translocator protein (TSPO) and Mcl-1 were obtained from Epitiomics, CA. Annexin V-FITC (Molecular Probes) was used to analyze cell apoptosis according to manufacturer's instructions. tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence was determined as a percentage of the control value. cells were stained by incubating them in medium containing 0.2 mol TMRE for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. TMRE fluorescence was examined by flow cytometry. fonic acid (pH 7.5) was centrifuged at 18,000 g for 15 min. supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g for 10 min to separate outer membranes. mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 10 min. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) target human Bax and Bak were chemically synthesized. a mixture of Opti-MEM medium and Lipofectamine 3000 was incubated for 5 min at RT. the mixtures containing siRNA or recombinant plasmid were then added to the wells. the cells were incubated for 1 h with the selected antibodies. compartments were immobilized on anti-Bax(NT), anti-Bax6A7, or anti-Flag monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads. proteins in the supernatant were collected and subjected to Western blotting. pGFP-2B, pGFP-2B(1\u201380) and pGFP-2B(1\u201363) were amplified from the pCMV-2B-Flag. cloned into the pGFP-C1 vector after digesting with EcoRI/SalI. EV71 2B localizes to the mitochondria and activates the mitochondrial component of the apoptotic cascade. RESULTS EV71 2B localizes to the mitochondria and activates the mitochondrial component of the apoptotic cascade. the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described before. a band representing 2B was detected in the outer membrane fraction of the mitochondria isolated from cells with 2B-Flag expression. antibodies to EV71 2B and -actin (internal control) were immunoblotted with antibodies to EV71 2B and -actin (internal control) control, cells transfected with Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. mitochondrial fractions were isolated at 48 h posttransfection. apoptotic cells were detected at 24 h posttransfection. a significant proportion of cells transfected with 2B showed increased annexin V fluorescence intensity. caspase inhibitors zDEVD.fmk and zLEHD.fmk showed very low levels of annexin V fluorescence. zDEVD.fmk or zLEHD.fmk completely inhibited apoptosis induced by 2B or EV71 infection. cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were separated and levels of Cyt c were determined by Western blotting. cells with 2B expression or EV71 infection displayed a clear loss of Cyt c from the mitochondrial fraction into the cytosol fraction. cells with no EV71 infection and 2B expression were treated with staurosporine for 12 h. pCMV-Flag, cells transfected with pCMV-Flag. EV71 2B specifically interacts with the proapoptotic protein Bax. the total amount of Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bid, Bim, Bad, or Mcl-1 was not affected by 2B expression. the total amount of Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bid, Bim, Bad, or Mcl-1 was not affected by 2B expression. recombinant Bax was immobilized on agarose beads conjugated with anti-His beads and incubated with cell lysates for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. agarose beads incubated with lysate of pCMV-Flag-transfected cells. antibodies directed against Bax effectively immunoprecipitated Bax and coimmunoprecipitated 2B. a 10-kDa band corresponding to 2B was detected by a Flag monoclonal antibody. EV71 2B induces translocation and activation of Bax. Bax translocation was monitored in cells transfected with pGFP-Bax. the results showed that almost no immunofluorescence signal colocalized with the mitochondria in the pCMV-Flag-transfected cells. in the pCMV-Flag-2B-transfected cells, a significant amount of Bax was detected in the mitochondria. cells were cotransfected with pGFP-Bax (green) and pCMV-Flag (control) or pCMV-Flag (control) or pCMV-2B-Flag. at 12 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. mitochondria from cells transfected with pCMV-Flag or pCMV-2B-Flag were cross-linked with BMH or DMSO. equal amounts of proteins from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-Bax antibody. cells were transfected with 2B or infected with EV71 at 48 h posttransfection. cell viability was determined 48 h posttransfection or 24 h postinfection. a similar loss of cell viability was observed for the Bak siRNA-transfected cells. RNA-transfected cells had significantly less active caspase-3 than the control siRNA-transfected cells. the supernatants of both the control siRNA-transfected cells and the Bak siRNA-transfected cells contained larger amounts of Cyt c than those of the Bax siRNA-transfected cells. this indicates that the downregulation of Bax could prevent the loss of Cyt c from the mitochondria to the cytosol fraction induced by 2B. EV71 (UV), UV-inactivated EV71. Control, siControl-transfected cells treated with 30 nM staurosporine. western blot analysis of Cyt c in the cytosol fraction of cells was separated and immunoblotted with an antibody to Cyt c. the mitochondria were incubated for 1.5 h with either 1 M recombinant Bax, 0.5 M recombinant Bax, 150 M Ca2+, or none of these reagents (control) at RT. mitochondria with 2B expression could combine more Bax and release more Cyt c. mitochondria were transfected with 2 g or 4 g of pCMV-Flag or pCMV-2B-Flag. at 24 h posttransfection, mitochondrial fractions were separated. mitochondria were incubated with purified cytosol (100 l) at 25\u00b0C for 1.5 h. activity were observed in cytosol fractions stimulated by mitochondria alone. Bcl-XL prevents 2B-induced release of Cyt c from mitochondria. when coexpressed in cells, Bcl-XL can abrogate proapoptotic effects of Bax. activated caspase-3 level was detected in HeLa-Bcl-XL cells with 2B expression. overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL caused a dramatic reduction in the level of induction of apoptosis in cells with 2B expression. mitochondria were isolated and incubated for 1 h with 1 M recombinant Bax or/and 10 M Bcl-XL at RT. equal amounts of each pellet fraction were lysed, boiled, and immunoblotted with antibody to Cyt c. resulting supernatants and pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. pCMV-Flag-transfected, 2B-transfected, and EV71-infected mitochondria. EV71 2B possesses a putative C-terminal hydrophobic -helix TM region. amphipathic -helix HR2 (aa 37 to 55) and an N-terminal hydrophilic helix HR1 (aa 22 to 35) expression had a diffuse fluorescence signal throughout the cell cytoplasm. expression had a punctuated staining pattern which colocalized with MitoTracker Red. all these results strongly suggest that the TM region in the C terminus may act as a transmembrane region that targets 2B to the mitochondrial outer membrane. cells were transfected with pGFP, pGFP-2B, pGFP-2B(1\u201363) or pGFP-2B(1\u201380) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red (red) for 10 min, fixed, and subjected to confocal microscopy analysis. coimmunoprecipitation assays involving the Bax and 2B truncations were performed a band representing Bax could be detected in eluates from cells transfected with 2B(1\u201322) and full-length 2B(1\u201399) no such protein band was observed in eluates from cells transfected with 2B(1\u201335), 2B(22\u201335) and control resins. cells expressing 2B, 2B(1\u201322), 2B(1\u201335), or 2B(22\u201335) were harvested and stained with annexin V-FITC. a significant proportion of cells treated with staurosporine or transfected with vectors expressing 2B(1\u201322) or full-length 2B displayed increased annexin V fluorescence intensity. no obvious annexin V-FITC fluorescence was detected in cells with 2B(1\u201322) or 2B(22\u201335) expression. cells with 2B(1\u201335) or 2B(22\u201335) expression showed a very low level of caspase-3 activation. cells with 2B(1\u201322) or 2B(22\u201335) showed a very low level of caspase-3 activation. more Bax was observed in mitochondrial fractions from 2B(1\u201322)- and full-length 2B-expressing cells than in those from 2B(1\u201335)- or 2B(22\u201335)-expressing cells. the results indicate that the 2B domain from aa 23 to 35 was responsible for cell apoptosis induced by EV71 2B. the resulting supernatants were immunoblotted with antibody to His tag. the recombinant Bax that attached to the mitochondria was immunoblotted with his tag. cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of these cells were separated by centrifugation. equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody or anti-2B antibody. cells with EV71 infection showed the absence of 2B, as expected. the ratio of GFP-positive cells to counted cells (in a total of 100 cells) was determined. immunoblotting analysis of 2B-Flag in the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of cells infected with EV71 or transfected with pCMV-Flag. apoptotic cells were detected at 24 h posttransfection. the percentages of apoptotic cells corresponding to the respective fluorescence intensities were calculated. caspase inhibitors are crucial for 2B-induced apoptosis. caspase inhibitors zDEVD.fmk and zLEHD.fmk showed low levels of annexin V fluorescence signal. contrast, strong annexin V fluorescence signals were detected in 2B- or recombinant Bak-EV71-infected cells treated with DMSO. zDEVD.fmk or zLEHD.fmk completely inhibited apoptosis induced by 2B or cells transfected with pCMV-Flag maintained high levels of TMRE fluorescence. 2B expression was independent of other EV71 proteins in inducing the loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. cells were infected with EV71 or transfected with pCMV-2B-Flag. cells transfected with pCMV-2B-Flag or pCMV-2B-Flag expressed similar levels of Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bid, Bim, Bad, and Mcl-1. eluted 2B fractions were probed with antibodies directed against various Bcl-2 family members. the precipitated proteins were blotted with anti-Flag and anti-BaxNT antibodies. agarose beads were incubated with the lysate of pCMV-Flag-transfected cells. anti-BaxNT coimmunoprecipitated Bax and Flag-2B. the band of IgGL shows an equal amount of anti-BaxNT conjugated to agarose beads. antibody also showed that Flag-2B coprecipitated with Bax. a low level of Bax was detected in the mitochondrial fraction from cells transfected with the control plasmid. this may represent a small amount of loosely attached Bax on the mitochondrial membrane. however, the amount of Bax in the cytosol fraction from 2B-transfected cells was notably less than that in the control cells. merged yellow color confirmed the colocalization of activated Bax and mitochondria in pCMV-2B-transfected cells. western blot analysis of Bax and activated Bax in the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of cells transfected with pCMV-Flag or pCMV-2B-Flag. cells transfected with pCMV-Flag or pCMV-2B-Flag were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bax6A7 antibody. equal amounts of protein and cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibody to Bax. mitochondria were isolated from 2B-transfected cells. dria purified from pCMV-Flag-transfected cells showed the retention of intramolecular cross-linked species of Bax and the absence of Bax homo-oligomers. experiments were done to determine the relative importance of Bak and Bax in 2B-induced apoptosis. siControl cells treated with staurosporine were used as a positive control. the results indicate that Bax and Bak siRNA-transfected cells both had caspase-3-like activity when treated with staurosporine. the control siRNA-transfected cells and Bak siRNA-transfected cells with 2B expression had relatively high levels of caspase-3-like activity. cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (siControl) were used as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared, analyzed by SDS-PAGE. they were either transfected with pCMV-2B-Flag for another 48 h. the mitochondria were incubated for 1.5 h with either Bax or Bax diluent buffer control. the supernatants contained larger amounts of Cyt c than that from the buffer control. mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatants were analyzed for the presence of Cyt c. mitochondrial fractions were lysed and immunoblotted with antibody to his tag or Bax. inputs of equivalent amounts of mitochondria and total Cyt c from the mitochondria were verified by immunoblot analysis using an antibody to Cox IV or Cyt c. supernatants from Bax-treated 2B mitochondria consistently resulted in striking increases in caspase-3 activity. however, no substantial elevations in caspase-3 activity were observed in cytosol fractions stimulated by mitochondria alone. we therefore examined the impact of Bcl-XL on 2B-induced cell apoptosis. overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL completely inhibited the 2B-induced Cyt c release. the effects of Bcl-XL overexpression on caspase-3-like activity during 2B-induced apoptosis were also assessed. caspase-3-like activity was determined as described in Materials and Methods. mitochondria were isolated and incubated for 1 h with 1 M recombinant Bax or/and 10 M Bcl-XL at RT. pCMV-Flag mitochondria were incubated with recombinant Bax. a significantly larger amount of Bax was detected in the 2B-transfected mitochondria. however, both the release of Cyt c from and binding of Bax to the mitochondria were almost completely inhibited by Bcl-XL. cells transfected with pGFP-2B showed the presence of pGFP-2B only in the mitochondrial pellet fraction. undetectable levels in the supernatant cytoplasmic fraction indicated that 2B without the TM region could not locate to the mitochondria. all these results strongly suggest that the TM region may act as a transmembrane region that targets 2B to the mitochondrial outer membrane. cells were transfected with pGFP, pGFP-2B(1\u201363), pGFP-2B(1\u201380) or pGFP-2B for 24 h. coimmunoprecipitation assays involving the Bax and 2B truncations were performed. ated protein samples were then analyzed by Western blotting to detect 2B and Bax binding. the results showed that shortening the 2B polypeptide at the N terminus abolished the Bax binding capacity of 2B. aa 22 to 35 of 2B may contain the domain directly responsible for the specific binding of EV71 2B to Bax. the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with antibodies to Bax and Flag. Activated Bax was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-Bax6A7 antibody. cell apoptosis was analyzed by using annexin V-FITC staining at 24 h posttransfection. significant proportion of cells treated with staurosporine showed increased annexin V-FITC fluorescence intensity. no obvious annexin fluorescence was detected in control cells or cells with 2B(1\u201322) or 2B(22\u201335) expression. supernatants from Bax-treated mitochondria from cells transfected with 2B(1\u201322) or full-length 2B contained large amounts of Cyt c. as a positive control, mitochondria stimulated by Ca2+ also released high levels of Cyt c, as expected. recombinant Bax protein associated with the mitochondria in the pellet was also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. western blot analysis of the impact of recombinant Bax on Cyt c release in isolated mitochondria. mitochondrial fractions were separated and incubated with 1 recombinant Bax, 100 M Ca2+, 150 M Ca2+. resulting supernatants were added to purified cell lysates. proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are the most downstream activator molecules known for Cyt c release. EV71 has been shown to induce classic signs of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis during infection. but little detail is known about the mechanisms of activation of the mitochondrion-related cell death pathway induced by EV71. protein 2B from PV and coxsackievirus A (CVB3) is thought to form homodimers and homotetramers that are located primarily in the membrane structure of host cells. it leads to the formation of hydrophobic pores which increase the permeability of the host cell membrane and promote the budding of virus particles (56, 59). 2B-transfected cells showed no obvious mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation or Cyt c release from mitochondria. cells were transfected with pCMV-2B-Flag or infected with EV71 (MOI = 1). at 12 h and 24 h postinfection, the cells were probed with 1.5 M Rhod-2 AM for specific detection of intramitochondrial calcium. bax has been shown to form channels in synthetic membranes. it is possible that Bax creates pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. it is conceivable that the interaction of Bax and 2B leads to formation of pores in the outer membrane of mitochondria that allow Cyt c to leak out. the EV71 2B, PV 2B, and CVB3 2B proteins have two hydrophobic domains, HR1 and HR2. the HR1 domain crosses the cell membrane via a cationic amphipathic -helix. the HR2 domain is a complete hydrophobic TM region (55, 71) the EV71 2B protein localized to the mitochondria and induced mitochondrion-associated cell death signals. the interaction of 2B with Bax resulted in the translocation of the latter to the mitochondria. this study provides evidence that EV71induces cell apoptosis by modulating Bax activation."}
