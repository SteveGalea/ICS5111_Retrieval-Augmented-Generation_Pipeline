{"summary": "study aimed to evaluate knowledge levels and training needs of disaster medicine among potential disaster responders. 547 health professionals, 456 medical students, and 1,526 local residents provided intact information. disaster medicine training, an integrated part of disaster preparedness, is vital for community residents to perform timely self-rescue and mutual-aid. disaster medicine training, an integrated part of efficient disaster preparedness, is vital for community residents to perform timely self-rescue and mutual-aid. disaster medicine education has not been included in the undergraduate curriculum of medical schools or in the continuing medical education in China. a study surveyed the disaster medicine education needs of health professionals who participated in the earthquake rescue, but their related knowledge was not evaluated. a total of 600 health professionals were composed of medical practitioners, medical teachers, and health administrators. a stratified cluster random sampling strategy was used to select 1,600 community residents. the second section contained 16 multiple-choice questions (Q1\u2013Q16) as a knowledge test covering various aspects of disaster medicine. participants could get one score for each correctly answered question and zero for an incorrect answer. the third section contained 5 multiple-choice questions regarding the training needs of disaster medicine. a total of 600 health professionals were composed of medical practitioners, medical teachers and health administrators. the medical practitioners were clinicians, public health physicians, nurses, and medical technicians from two comprehensive tertiary hospitals and three CDCs. ethics statement Informed consent was initially distributed to every candidate study subjects to help them make a fully voluntary decision on participating or declining. the study protocol conforms to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. 197 (7.8%) had disaster relief experience and 33 (1.3%) had ever received systematic training of disaster medicine. for all 2,529 participants, most of them (87.1%) had low or moderate self-estimated knowledge concerning disaster medicine. 1.3 290 19.0 Moderate 344 62.9 252 55.3 1,069 70.1 Little 172 31.4 198 43.4 167 10.9 Channels of acquiring information about disaster medicine #

disaster administration and disaster rescue organization. there were significant differences in knowledge levels among 4 specialties of medical practitioners. clinicians showed higher knowledge level than other specialties, even on the aspect of epidemic prevention and control. community residents showed very poor knowledge and skills of disaster medicine. not surprisingly, community residents lacked specialty knowledge such as 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure' and 'difference between remote and urban rescue' based on these data, we suggest a diagram flow of disaster medicine training as the Shanghai model in Figure S2. the study was conducted in Shanghai, one of the areas with well developed economy and affluent medical resources in china.
