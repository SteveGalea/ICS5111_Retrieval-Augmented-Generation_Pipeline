{"summary": "Purpose Viral infections are involved in 50% of exacerbations. there have been few reports on the causative virus of exacerbations in adult asthmatics. we compared frequencies and types of viruses between lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) with exacerbations. asthma is a highly prevalent, chronic respiratory condition characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation producing frequent exacerbations. there are 300 million people worldwide affected by asthma. the study was prospectively carried out in a tertiary hospital in Korea from June 2009 to June 2014. all subjects had a clinical diagnosis of asthma supported by at least one of the following criteria: an increase in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of >12% or 200 mL after inhalation of 400 g albuterol. cat fur, dog fur, cockroaches, grass pollens, ragweed pollens and Aspergillus species were used in the skin-prick tests. exclusion criteria were the presence of parenchymal lung diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, idiopathic interstitial lung diseases. all portions with visibly greater solidity were carefully selected and placed in pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes. the samples were diluted by adding 8 volumes of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. the total cell count was determined using a hemocytometer. cDNA, 5RV2 primer, 8-methoxypsoralen solution and 2multiplex Master Mix were mixed and heated at 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes. RT-PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel to identify ADV, hMPV, PIV 1/2/3, IFV A, IFV B, RSV A/B. an increase in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of >12% or 200 mL after inhalation of 400 g albuterol. a reduction in the FEV1 of 20% in response to a provocative concentration of 10 mg/mL inhaled methacholine (PC20) and a reduction in the FEV1 of 20% over 14 days after inhaled or systemic corticosteroid use. an exacerbation was diagnosed when pre-existing dyspnea and wheezing became aggravated within 14 days. we divided them into exacerbated LRTI and stable LRTI. informed written consent was obtained from all subjects and all procedures were approved. the isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Viral Gene-spinTM Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) the RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA following the protocol of the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) Pearson's 2 test was applied for comparisons of the detection frequencies between the exacerbation and stable groups. data are expressed as meansstandard error (SE) of the mean. 4 0.971 BMI (kg/m2) 24.350.25 21.570.88 0.003 Atopy (Y, %) 38.20 45.30 0.467 IgE (IU/mL) 460.6554.00 203.9839.32 0.001 Blood eosinophils (%) 4.040.39 1.780.56* 0.001 FVC (% predicted) 67.740.99 (238) 86.321.95 (60) 210 patients underwent a single sputum examination and 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. number of cases is the number of cases of exacerbated and stable asthma. RV was the most frequently detected virus in both the exacerbated and stable cases. 210 (44 stable and 166 exacerbated cases) underwent one sputum examination. the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. a further 28 samples were obtained from 14 subjects with exacerbations. 10 cases at the first examination (+/, 71.4%) and 1 case at the second examination (/+, 7.1%); it was not detected in 3 cases (/, 21.4%). there was a significant difference in the virus-positive and -negative rates between the 2 groups (P=2.0010-4) among the 14 exacerbated/stable cases, 10 (71.4%) had virus-positive initial sputum samples (exacerbated state) but virus-negative second sputum samples (stable state) clinical characteristics of the subjects We obtained 353 sputum samples from 283 asthmatics with URTI or LRTI symptoms. among them, 30 sputum samples were discarded because of inadequate quality. the exacerbated cases had significantly lower FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC values compared with those in a stable state (P0.001). 460.6554.00 203.9839.32 0.001 Blood eosinophils (%) 4.040.39 1.780.56* 0.001 FVC (% predicted) 67.740.99 (238) 86.321.95 (60) 0.001 FEV1(% predicted) 61.161.23 (238) 86.573.27 (60) 0.001 FEV1/FVC ratio (%) 65.720.80 (236) 74.321.52 Respiratory viruses detected in 68 (26.3%) of the 259 exacerbated-state sputum samples and in 12 of the 64 stable-state samples. RV was the most frequently detected virus in both the exacerbated and stable cases (32.4% vs 41.7%; P=0.529; Table 2). 210 (44 stable and 166 exacerbated cases) underwent one sputum examination. the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. a further 28 samples were obtained from 14 subjects with exacerbations. significant difference in the virus-positive and -negative rates between the 2 groups (P=2.0010-4) among the 14 exacerbated/stable cases, 10 (71.4%) had virus-positive initial sputum samples (exacerbated state) but virus-negative second sputum samples (stable state) the exacerbated/exacerbated group had a significantly higher frequency of an initial positive sample and a follow-up negative sample than did the exacerbated/exacerbated group. RV was responsible for one-third (32.4%) of the viral infections in exacerbated cases. this frequency is in good agreement with previous reports on Caucasians. RV was detected in 14/30 (46.6%) asthmatics and 3/9 (33.3%) non-asthmatics. a longitudinal study of adult asthmatics reported that one-third of symptomatic respiratory tract viral infections were not associated with worsening of asthma symptoms. in a 1979 study of children, the detection rate was 26.4%. in that study, virus isolation was performed by cell culture. respiratory viruses can now be identified by virus culture, serology, immunofluorescence antigen detection, and PCR-based tests. lag time between the appearance of LRTI symptoms and sputum virus analysis may have resulted in the low detection rate. a subset of patients is particularly susceptible to recurrent exacerbations in the presence of viral LRTI. in our study, the frequency of virus detection was not different between atopics and non-atopics. however, determining whether the exacerbation is due to viral infection or other causes is not feasible at present. the predominant respiratory virus depends on the season. with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with sequential exacerbation and stable episodes. seasonal variations in detection rates show similar patterns to those of Caucasian asthmatics."}
