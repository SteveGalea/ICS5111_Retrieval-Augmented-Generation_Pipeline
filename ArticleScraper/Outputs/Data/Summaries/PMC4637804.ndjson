{"summary": "the etiology of Kawasaki disease is currently unknown. it is a reasonable open hypothesis that Kawasaki disease is caused by an unidentified microorganism that induces striking immune perturbations. it is a reasonable open hypothesis that Kawasaki disease is caused by an unidentified microorganism. corticosteroids have been used more early as the second line therapy for patients unresponsive to initial IVIG treatment. methylprednisolone was used as the second line therapy in 196 patients (27.1%) among the 722 patients unresponsive to initial IVIG. despite initial IVIG treatment, 6.8%-38.3% of patients are unresponsive to it. the rate of resistance to second additional IVIG only treatment was 22.2%-48.6%[18,22,24-26,38], and was not lower than that to initial IVIG treatment. corticosteroids have been considered as an alternative treatment. hypertension as a systolic/diastolic blood pressure > 95th percentile of normal standard; hyperglycemia as a fasting blood glucose > 6.99 mmol/L; hyponatremia as a serum Na+ level 135 mmol/L[26]. corticosteroids seem to be more effective than IVIG[23,25,42]. however, Furukawa et al[22] warned of a tendency for recrudescent patients re-Tx day after fever onset1 No. of patients with response No. of patients with response No. of patients with CAA No. of patients with adverse effects [22] 411 36 h after IVIG 63 2nd line IVMP 30 mg/kg per day, 3 d 44 7 (6-8) 34 5 Hypertension 5, hypothermia 3, bradycardia 3, transient paralysis 1 Followed Pd IVIG 1-2 g/kg 19 8 (5-11) 12 2 [ corticosteroids and additional IVIG as the second line treatment need further study. there has been no confirmative evidence of a better usefulness of corticosteroids as the second line treatment compared to additional IVIG. this combination has been tried more frequently as the first line treatment instead. the combination of corticosteroids and IVIG as the first line therapy improved the clinical course and coronary artery outcome in their multicenter prospective study with 178 patients. however, the result of a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 216 patients in which dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg per day for 3 d) was administered did not agree with the result by Inoue et al[48]. model, 78% and 76% in the Egami scoring model, 77% and 86% in the Sano scoring model, respectively, according to the reports by their respective creators[51-53]. the other predictive scoring systems have had no subsequent studies to show their usefulness, or are based on a small number of subjects[31,58-60]. the time to start a treatment was 2 d earlier in their study, the longer duration of the administration of corticosteroids, and the ethnic homogeneity of many clinical/laboratory variables have been reported as the predictors. there has been no report in which any aggressive therapy prevented coronary artery lesions in patients at high risk of unresponsiveness predicted by biomarkers. illness at initial treatment 4 [31,33,51,51,52,58,60,71] Recurrent Kawasaki disease Recurrent case [33] Principal features/symptoms Early appearance [72] Polymorphous exanthema [60] Lymphadenopathy [32] Other physical findings Change around anus [60] Brand of IVIG -propiolactone [65,66] Neutrophil 80%, or increased [51,58,60,69,72] Band form 20%, or increased [ -aggressive initial treatment for patients at high risk of IVIG unresponsiveness after risk stratification using a predictive model has been recommended in the recently updated guidelines for the medical treatment of acute Kawasaki disease in Japan[39]. future investigations to determine the best predictive model to use are necessary."}
