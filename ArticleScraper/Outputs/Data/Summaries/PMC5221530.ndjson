{"summary": "infectious diseases can negatively affect, among others, morbidity, mortality, unemployment and inequality. the main objective of infectious disease transmission models is to inform and guide policy-makers to prepare for and respond to (re)emerging infectious diseases. there is an interest to incorporate behaviour change in response to disease-related information into models for infectious disease transmission. game theory assumes individuals take rational decisions based on a trade-off that embodies the anticipated rational decisions of all other individuals in society. a multitude of BCMs in the setting of infectious disease transmission still use a game-theoretical foundation that caused the development of 'vaccination games' and 'epidemic games with social distancing' the main goal of this paper is to systematically review and document how and to which extent behavioural immunity has been explored in infectious disease transmission models over the past 5 years. in brief, we aim to investigate to which extent: (i) technological advancements and increased data availability have enriched BCMs. the current models have assessed the importance of social networks in individual decisions. infectious diseases are defined using the WHO definition: infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. only records that concern infectious diseases are included in the selection. 2.1. search We searched PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) for records published between January 2010 and December 2015. the results of the search query were based on title and abstract in accordance with pre-specified eligibility criteria. we exclude studies tackling forced interventions such as school closure or mandatory vaccination. at least one trigger for modelled individuals to change their behaviour is external. we exclude research on plants, animals, the behaviour of the model itself. results 3.1.

[155 the choice of prevention measure naturally depends on the disease under study. a minority of models does not specify the preventive action taken by individuals. most models retrieved were on influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) and HIV. d'Onofrio et al. introduce public interventions in their model to increase vaccine uptake. diseases in the \u2018other\u2019 category are: SARS, smallpox-like disease, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis B, Ebola, pneumococcus, pneumonic plague, toxoplasmosis and cholera. etti et al. used the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010 to parametrize an influenza transmission model with behavioural changes focusing on the spread of risk perceptions in the population. a model on Ebola virus disease (EVD) was published in 2015 in response to the epidemic outbreak in liberia. individual-level models are gaining interest in the BCM literature. they can introduce heterogeneity in behaviours, tackle clustering of vaccine sentiments and look at stochastic and local outbreaks of infectious diseases with a high vaccination coverage (e.g. measles) individual-level models are well suited to model social distancing behaviour in terms of reduced contacts as a prevention strategy. rumours can inflate the perception of disease prevalence, even if the true prevalence is low. in table 2, we classify the studies we identified in a matrix.

[67], Bauch et al. [147], Bu studies that met our eligibility criteria, but are unclear about the information individuals use [14,56,85,103,111,187] were excluded from figure 2. more articles are using multiple information types and/or sources, making individual behaviour more realistic. 16 papers describing BCMs in which there is no two-way interaction with a disease transmission model. a third example is the model by Joshi et al. [170] where a time-dependent education function moves susceptible individuals into lower susceptibility classes with lower transmission rates. mao & Yang used an individual risk function incorporating proportion of \u2018adopters\u2019 among contacts, perceived pressure of \u2018adoption\u2019 and proportion of infective neighbours. once the risk function exceeds a threshold, individuals adopt preventive behaviour, which in this case consisted of taking prophylactic antivirals. the latter subcategory requires a third-party spreading the information for individuals to receive. a multitude of these models introduce an \u2018aware\u2019 compartment in the model. a rate introduces people in an \u2018aware\u2019 class after which the awareness spreads through the population. individuals take their prevention decision based on an objective function. this approach assumes individuals take their prevention decision based on an objective function. the individual makes the following trade-off, with P, the choice of taking the prevention measure. embodies individuals' behaviour by the maximization of expected utility determined by adapting the contact level (i.e. social distancing) we retrieved 26 papers describing a BCM with an objective function with imitation. it is assumed that people compare their own prevention-related behaviour with that of other individuals in society. the probability of individual i switching to the strategy of individual j is 3.2. parameter can be interpreted as expressing \u2018stickiness\u2019 in behaviour. for large values of (e.g. 0,9) their behaviour becomes \u2018sticky\u2019. less than 20% of studies have fitted or validated their model to behavioural and/or disease transmission data. social media data and other electronic sources of information are increasingly used. participatory experiments have been performed to capture social distancing. Cohen et al. [24] surveyed a convenience sample of students about their risk perceptions for influenza A/H1N1 to estimate the utility values of different behaviours. the study used data on awareness and concern about the risk of contagion to populate their model on influenza A/H1N1. the health belief model (HBM) [191] is frequently used to retrieve prevention behaviour and parametrize BCMs. data from the 2009 influenza pandemic have been useful to inform the disease dynamics parallel with BCMs. incidence and outbreak data have been useful to inform the disease dynamics parallel with BCMs. behavioural change framework introduced in the model has a game-theoretic foundation with inclusion of imitation. a model for the dynamics of vaccine uptake with a public intervention was proposed by d'Onofrio et al. [92]. the model is validated comparing the model prediction with observed vaccination uptake data during both the UK vaccine-scare period and high coverage period. the number of articles matching our eligibility criteria increased from 18 in 2010 to 38 in 2015, but there was a single year downward deviation from the trend in 2014. the number of articles matching our eligibility criteria increased from 18 in 2010 to 38 in 2015. studies can appear in multiple categories, as some have multiple prevention strategies or multiple effects on the disease transmission model. all references are categorized and represented in a spreadsheet that can be found as electronic supplementary material. the model type is often disease-dependent.

[133], Maharaj & Kleczkowski [134], the choice of prevention measure naturally depends on the disease under study. the discovery and implementation of antivirals as a prophylactic for influenza and HIV has resulted in publication of models with pre-exposure antiviral use as individual behaviour. some authors use the term \u2018social distancing\u2019 as a synonym for all non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in table 1, we classified the records based on four specific disease categories. most models retrieved were on influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) and HIV. the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010 has largely influenced the development of BCMs for influenza. a model on Ebola virus disease (EVD) was published in 2015 in response to the epidemic outbreak in liberia. population-level models, metapopulation and individual-level models are gaining interest in the BCM literature. individual-level models can introduce heterogeneity in behaviours, tackle clustering of vaccine sentiments and look at stochastic and local outbreaks of infectious diseases with a high vaccination coverage (e.g. measles) information gathering In order for individuals to change their behaviour in relation to prevention measures, they require disease-related information. examples of disease-related, external information include: news broadcasts on a disease outbreak or rumours among friends and family about VRSEs or vaccine-preventable disease.

[120], Lubuma & Terefe [121], Meloni et al. most BCMs are using information that is globally available and prevalence-based. these models are frequently game-theoretic (or pay-off maximizing) behavioural change frameworks coupled with disease transmission models. the bij model introduces different forms of information in the individual's risk perception of an epidemic. we extracted how individuals were modelled to translate the information they receive into behavioural change. we identified five distinct categories for characterizing the decision-making process of individuals, listed in 3.8.1\u20133.8.5. information threshold (29/178) retrieved 29 BCMs in which behaviour change is modelled on exceeding a predefined information threshold. the information the individual assesses can be obtained in a direct way (e.g. through prevalence in neighbours) or in an indirect way. 92,94\u201396,99,100,102,104\u2013109,113,115\u2013117,119\u2013126,128\u2013131,133,134,137,148,148,149,153,157,161,165,166,168,171\u2013178,184\u2013186,188,189. in this category, the information is a continuous input in the decision-making process of individuals. social impact is introduced in a model by Ni et al. [186], where they use complex networks for the spread of opinions driving the individual probability of prevention behaviour. most often these models assign additional characteristics to nodes (which represent individuals), apart from disease state. an example could be that a node is assigned a disease state and an opinion which is either provaccination or contravaccination. individuals take their vaccination decision based on perceived vaccination cost. their BCM model exhibits a \u2018wait and see\u2019 Nash equilibrium. individuals incorporate concept of herd immunity in their prevention behaviour. the 'game-theoretic' model has been adapted to include social influence or imitation behaviour. it is assumed that people compare their own prevention-related behaviour with that of other individuals in society. individuals learn whether their own behaviour is optimal and, to which extent they should adapt it. the underlying assumption is that for some individuals peer influence and social conforming behaviour is\u2014to a certain extent\u2014more important than pay-off maximization. in the majority of these models, assumptions rather than real-life observations guide the choice and distribution of the \u2018stickiness\u2019 parameter. the information the individual assesses can be obtained in a direct way (e.g. through prevalence in neighbours) or in an indirect way (e.g. through rumours or opinions). the information the individual assesses can be obtained in a direct way (e.g. through prevalence in neighbours) or in an indirect way (e.g. through rumours or opinions). two subcategories can be distinguished: models with a direct relation between infectious disease parameters and behaviour formation, and models with an indirect relation, through an information spread medium. the functional form does not need to be linear. some examples are vaccination coverage as a positive decreasing function of perceived risk of VRSE [148] provaccine node is assigned a disease state and an opinion which is either provaccination or contravaccination. if a node is surrounded by many vaccine sceptics, transmission of both disease and opinions can occur. this will influence the individual's probability of taking vaccination as a prevention measure. individuals take their vaccination decision based on perceived vaccination cost in the context of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. their BCM model exhibits a \u2018wait and see\u2019 Nash equilibrium where individuals incorporate the concept of herd immunity in their prevention behaviour. the larger the beneficial pay-off difference, the higher the probability of switching your behaviour. a Fermi-like function is used, guiding the adoption to the better strategy depending on the magnitude of the pay-off difference. model parametrization and validation based on empirical data on behavioural responses to disease-related information informing these models. we critically assessed model parametrization, distinguishing data-driven from assumption-driven parametrization. et al. [48] surveyed sexual attitudes and lifestyle to build a sexual contact network. IBM in Gray et al. [85] for syphilis transmission was also informed. disease transmission parameters were calibrated from syphilis diagnosis among gay men in Victoria, Australia. Xia et al. [25] constructed a social network using data of an online Facebook-like community to construct a BCM for disease and vaccine awareness on the 2009 influenza pandemic in Hong Kong. the same pandemic inspired Springborn et al. to use home television viewing as a proxy for social distancing [56] the HIV model of Viljoen et al. [80] is fitted to prevalence data in south africa and botswana to look at the effect of awareness on disease spread. behavioural change framework introduced in the model has a game-theoretic foundation with inclusion of imitation. Johnson et al. [72] used prevalence data, antenatal clinic surveys and household surveys for parametrization. they calibrated both disease and behaviour parameters to age-specific data using a Bayesian approach. a similar conclusion can be drawn from Vietri et al. [9] who tested whether college students consider either free-riding or altruistic motives to decide on (not) receiving vaccinations. they find that individuals both incorporate their own risk of infection and altruistic motives in their decision of whether or not to vaccinate. real-life data collection during the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 has been a milestone for the parametrization of BCMs. for some models, data are just not available, and one needs to resort to assumptions to model behavioural change. excluding behavioural change from infectious disease models equates to assuming behaviour is unaffected by risk perceptions and disease incidence. generalized BCMs accommodating multiple pathogens seem unrealistic. but it would be easier to combine multiple diseases with the same transmission and prevention properties. for example, a person vaccinated for seasonal influenza may put less effort into hygienic measures such as hand-washing. social networks impose a structure in the population enabling the identification of model subjects at the individual-level. neighbours can be identified to implement game-theoretic models with imitation dynamics. the development of these networks has increased the feasibility of modelling local or combined local\u2013global information sources in a BCM. internet and social media Information gathering by individuals has evolved over the past decades with the introduction of the Internet, mobile phones and associated social media applications. it is well documented that web-based information can provide a distorted picture about disease risks and adverse events from vaccinations. irrational behaviour and altruism BCMs have evolved from the perspective of a fully rational \u2018Homo economicus\u2019 to a more reasonable, empathic \u2018Homo sapiens\u2019. this evolution is conform to the findings of surveys examining individuals' drivers to take vaccination. the availability of real-life observations determines to a large extent the feasibility of introducing heterogeneity in BCMs. a trade-off needs to be made in terms of computational efficiency, data availability and desirability of heterogeneity. model output may depend on the model specification, to the extent that the selection and development of a model leads in a predictive way towards a predefined conclusion. in many pure game-theoretic models, free-rider behaviour emerges resulting in suboptimal vaccination coverage levels. in models including imitation behaviour, the results are often ambiguous. focus group participants tend to \u2018base their vaccination decision on the trade-off between perceived benefits and barriers of the vaccine...\u2019. in their vaccination strategy, Swedish participants incorporate: following the rules, doing the right thing, solidarity with other citizens and social influences. we encourage the collection of such real-time data in future outbreaks. excluding behavioural change from infectious disease models equates to assuming behaviour is unaffected by risk perceptions and disease incidence. this review has also met with important limitations in clarity of assumptions and methods in many publications. a person vaccinated for seasonal influenza may put less effort into hygienic measures such as hand-washing. however, individuals taking hygiene measures may also be more inclined to engage in social distancing if these individuals are more risk-averse. a review by Wang et al. focuses on coupling disease dynamics with behaviour in complex networks. a more general work covering BCMs is the book by Manfredi & D'Onofrio [201] we recommend policy-makers to implement measures to distinguish between evidence-based and unsubstantiated information. a quality label for health-related websites and public health information campaigns are two examples of such measures. in most recent literature, only few papers are still using a pure, self-centred game-theoretic model. instead, some form of irrational behaviour has been introduced by the inclusion of social influences or imitation. however, most of the imitation BCMs did not empirically justify their choice of stickiness parameter. 4.7. Limitations and strengths Our search was limited to the past 6 years. this is also testified by the evolution of our search yield over the 6 year period we covered. however, as with any systematic review, our search string strikes a balance between completeness and feasibility. the 2009 influenza pandemic presented an opportunity for parametrization and validation of both disease transmission and BCMs for flu-like illnesses. current models have assessed the importance of social networks in individual decisions."}
