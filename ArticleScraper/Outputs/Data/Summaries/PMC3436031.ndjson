{"summary": "the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was introduced by Mullis [1]. it can amplify fewer than 10 target copies, significantly improving assay sensitivity. the approach requires thermal cycling instrumentation, considerable expertise and a substantial amount of space in routine diagnostic laboratories. the development of DNA amplification microinstruments began in the 1990s. it was desirable to create a totally integrated device performing a series of specific molecular functions such as nucleic acid extraction and purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection, and other supporting analysis techniques, with minimal dead volumes. the NASBA assay has been widely employed for identifying bacterial and viral RNA in clinical samples. the reaction is performed with a two-stage protocol: initial phase for denaturation and primer annealing at 65 \u00b0C. the reverse primers (P1) contain polymerase promoter sequences. automated NASBA system, NucliSENS EasyQ, can perform simultaneous amplification and detection using fluorescence quantification. the detection takes place in a single closed tube to significantly reduce contamination risks. this platform also helps decrease the hands-on time and provides rapid results. a NASBA chamber for RNA amplification was incubated with bovine serum albumin overnight before the reaction was started. the system, called immuno-NASBA, combined the versatility of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the amplification power of NASBA. BD ProbeTec ET is a semiautomated real-time system for carrying out SDA with fluorescence detection. the technique still requires a higher temperature (95 \u00b0C) to perform a denaturation step for initial primer binding and amplification. circular padlock probes can be copied by DNA polymerases from phage 29, resulting in multiple copies of the circle DNA sequences. this polymerase, with an excellent strand displacement activity, is important for efficient RCA because it can continuously progress around the circle probe and displace the amplified fragment, generating a long ssDNA product. a glass microchip consists of a Y-shaped microchannel with a dam structure. magnetic particles were introduced to separate the target from body fluid. a clinical sample was detectable in less than 65 min after the reaction was initiated. merase is derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus living in hot springs. it has polymerize activity, 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity, and strand displacement ability. at a suitable temperature, Bst polymerase with strand displacement activity can separate the non-template strand from the template DNA without the thermal cycles of the PCR process. a microfluidics chip made of PMMA has been used for the turbidity detection of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) LAMP reaction. the lowest limitation for detection of the HBV DNA template was 50 copies/25 L with the critical detecting time set at 30 min. the valve containing the sphere beads closes the microchannel to leave the buffer injected inside the reaction chamber. the valve can withstand a maximum of 200 kPa, so that it can tolerate the internal pressure produced by heating. a single-channel turbidimetry instrument was assembled to a small device by Lee et al. the SPR setup consists of an 850 nm light-emitting diode (LED), a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and a disposable polycarbonate-based reaction chamber with a prism. the results showed that a detection limitation at 2 fg DNA per microliter within 20 min was achieved. a thermostable helicase was developed from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. it can be operated at temperatures from 45 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C. the original reaction is performed at 37 \u00b0C for the entire process. redox probes are bound to streptavidin-conjugated color particles. the hybrids are bound to streptavidin-conjugated color particles. they are captured on the test zone by the interaction between the target DNA-FITC capture probe and an anti-FITC antibody. detection of two pathogens in single- and duplex-format of OnChip HDA was carried out within 2 h. microfluidic DNA assays involving on-chip isothermal amplification have also been developed for HDA. integrated system performed DNA purification from whole bacteria in a liquid sample, followed by HDA and nucleic acid hybridization. this system allowed multiple operations to be performed on chip. such an integrated microfluidic device can become a portable device for rapid, label-free specific detection. nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) is a sensitive transcription-based isothermal amplification system for mimicking retroviral RNA replication. the NASBA assay has been widely employed for identifying bacterial and viral RNA in clinical samples. NASBA has been shown to have sensitivity comparable to that of RT-PCR. molecular beacon probes are designed to hybridize with the product, generating a specific fluorescent signal. the fluorescence provides a real-time monitoring of NASBA progress. microfluidic NASBA chip integrated solid-phase extraction, real-time fluorescence detection, and a NASBA assay. the chip was modeled on a 96-well ELISA microplate with 43 reaction chambers so that it would be fully compatible with a conventional reader. BD ProbeTec ET is a semiautomated real-time system for carrying out SDA with fluorescence detection. the system is designed to have single-stranded restriction enzyme recognition site overhangs. the second set of the primers (B1 and B2) represent the bumper primers. the developed SDA strip allows the detection of keratin 10 in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis produced at 1 fm within 75 min. 2.3. the probes are designed to circularize via ligation with the DNA target strand. a new tab (A) Schematic illustration of the principal steps of RCA. various sensors have been developed with RCA based on electrochemistry [45\u201347], optics [48\u201350], fluorescence [51\u201353], chemiluminescence [54,55] and other assays. a glass microchip consists of a Y-shaped microchannel with a dam structure. ism of arrays was developed by Yang et al. for protein quantitation down to the low nanomolar range [53] Konry et al. constructed a two-layer sandwich assay on microbead surfaces for the combined detection of DNA and protein molecules in a single approach. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) plays a key role in the LAMP reaction process. microfluidic chips have been applied to the detection of LAMP reactions in recent years. the lowest limitation for detection of the hepatitis B virus was 50 copies/25 L with the critical detecting time set at 30 min. a thermoresponsive polymer microvalve was used in a LAMP microchannel device. the valve was made using an expandable microsphere filled with isobutene and isopentane and a shell of vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, and methyl methacrylate. the valve can withstand a maximum of 200 kPa, so that it can tolerate the internal pressure produced by heating. the detection limit of HIV DNA was improved to 10 copies in a reaction time of less than 40 min by adding DNA inside the reaction chamber. turbidimetry instrument was assembled to a small device by Lee et al. the threshold for the calibration curve was determined using serial diluted positive control. the threshold for the calibration curve was determined using serial diluted positive control. the viral load of the influenza virus was estimated by the area under the curve. a DNA-based sensor for the detection of M. tuberculosis was developed. the dextrin-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) used as a reporter can be electrochemically detected on a screen-printed carbon electrode chip. andresen et al. performed HDA in a microarray format, making it suitable for the simultaneous detection of various pathogens. the detection of the two pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and S. aureus was carried out within 2 h. an absorbent pad was placed at the end of the sample loading channel. the dried primer pair was inside each microchamber, which can be an interesting microfabrication procedure. these advantages and features help make these devices applicable for the real-time detection of SARS cDNA with a detection limit of 0.1 ng/L. esized DNA strand with a recognition sequence for the DNA endonuclease. this allows an enzyme to nick the DNA strand. this allows an enzyme to displace the nicked strand. the polymerase can also displace the nicked strand. the development of chip-based isothermal assay systems has received great attention. achieving a higher degree of portability remains a challenge. commercialization requires further improvement in on-chip sample pretreatment, miniaturization of detectors, decrease in power consumption."}
