{"summary": "infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death. infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death. infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death. XOD is a molybdenum iron-sulfur flavin hydroxylase that is widely distributed in most animal species [8,28] there is mounting evidence that increased XOD activity is correlated with the development of many diseases due to the concomitantly increased production of uric acid and free radicals. 240 apparently healthy hens were randomly allocated to infected and control groups and individually numbered. each group contained three replicates, and there were 40 birds in each replicate. nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus was preserved by the clinical veterinary science laboratory of Jiangxi Agricultural University. all experiments were conducted after institutional approval of the animal Care and Use Committee of Jiangxi Agricultural University. serum activities or concentrations of XOD, SOD, GSH-PX, uric acid (UA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using commercially available kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Research Institute, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. real-time PCR was conducted using 300 ng of cDNA and a premix EX Taq Probe qPCR Kit (no. DRR390A; Takara Bio) in 384 well plates in a. ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus was preserved by the clinical veterinary science laboratory of Jiangxi Agricultural University. each chicken in the infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of 10-5 median embryo infectious doses. chickens in control group were intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of sterile physiological saline as virus-free controls. clinical signs were observed at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) in most infected chickens. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription reaction in a reaction volume of 20 L containing: reaction solution from Genomic DNA elimination reaction, 10 L; RT Primer Mix, 4.0 L; 5 PrimeScript Buffer 2, 4.0 L; PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix 1, 1.0 L; RNase free dH2O, 1.0 L. PCR was conducted using an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System. amplification curves were analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection Software to obtain Ct values for each PCR system. activities of XOD, GSH-PX and SOD Figs. 1,2,3 show the serum activity of XOD in the infected group and control group at 8, 15 and 22 dpi, individually. at 8 and 15 dpi, the serum activity of XOD in the infected group had increased significantly when compared with the control group. at 22 dpi, SOD and GSH-PX did not differ significantly. DA was found to be significantly higher in the infected group than in the control group at 8 dpi. at 15 dpi, the serum concentration of UA and MDA in the infected group was statistically higher than that of the control group. no significant difference was observed in UA and MDA between the infected and control group. at 7 dpi, most of the chickens showed rales, coughing, head shaking and defecation of white excrement. 28 of the infected chickens died after 8 dpi. serum superoxide dismutases (SOD) activities in chickens in control and infected groups. N = 12 per group at each time. significant differences are indicated by **p 0.01 in comparison with control group. XOD can oxidize a variety of purines, pyrimidines, pteridines, and other heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds while concomitantly generating UA, superoxide anion (O2 -) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) it is well known that appropriate concentrations of UA and reactive oxygen species are necessary for maintenance of homeostasis. the bovine XOD gene lacks a hypoxia response element for hypoxia-inducible factor-1. however, cytokines including TNF, IFN-, IL-6, and IL-1 could induce increases in XOD activity and mRNA transcript levels in bovine renal epithelial cells. XOD was a major source of ROS in reperfused myocardium. in disease promotion and prevention, ROS act as a double-edged sword. in disease promotion and prevention, ROS act as a double-edged sword. the activities of both SOD and GSH-PX reflect the capability of elimination of free radicals in the body. chickens infected with NIBV would induce an increase in ROS, leading to decreased antioxidants in the body."}
