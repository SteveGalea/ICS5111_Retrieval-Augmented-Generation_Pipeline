{"summary": "the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. the accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades was 96.4%. the results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts. dependence on a central laboratory has certain limitations, with potential clinical, operational and economic implications. one of the major technological advances has been in the recognition and quantification of differential white count. the initial three-part differential count expanded to the five-part differential count, with differentiation of the granulocyte count into neutrophil, basophil and eosinophil counts. venous samples from frequently accessed veins need to be preserved for chemotherapy. it is not routine practice to monitor the neutrophil count during the chemotherapy cycle unless the patient reports symptoms suggestive of developing severe neutropenia complicated by infection. there have been very few studies comparing the diagnostic performance of granulocytes in patients receiving chemotherapy. all samples were submitted for a full blood count analysis, including a five-part differential on a Siemens ADVIA 120 analyser until august 2004. all instruments were subjected to multiple quality control checks each day according to standard laboratory protocols. data of interest included the eosinophil, basophil and neutrophil counts. the regression analysis was on a random subset of 32,000 results in each subset. 2.3. Difference analyses Bland-Altman plots were constructed to assess the relation between neutrophil and total granulocyte count. the difference between measures is plotted against the average of the two measurements. no identifiable data was contained within the dataset. the research was sanctioned under the information governance procedures of LTHT. no patients were excluded based on chemotherapy treatment, demographic information, diagnosis or timing of treatment. passing-Bablok regression analysis was conducted using the MCR package for R [19]. this was performed separately on subsets of individuals with neutrophil counts classified as N0-N1 (normal to grade 1 neutropenia, 1.5 to 7.5 109 cells/L) and N2-N4 (grade 2\u20134 neutropenia, 1.5 109 cells/L) using grading criteria defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [20]. only one neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, monocyte and lymphocyte count result per patient per day. the total number of results within the reference range was 258,363 (50.8%) for neutrophils (2.5\u20137.5 109 cells/L), 329,179 (64.7%) for eosinophils (0.04\u20130.4109 cells/L) and 436,970 (85.9%) for basophils. eosinophils (x 109 cells/L) (minimum = 0; maximum = 180.58, median = 3.55; mean = 4.49; SD = 4.21); basophils (x 109 cells/L) (minimum = 0; maximum = 53.69, median = 0.07; mean = 0.12; SD = 0.26); basophils (x 109 cells/L) (minimum = 0; maximum = 51.43, median = 0.03 all data pairs lie necessarily below the identity line. 97.0% of grade 1 results had a difference of less than 0.358109 cells/L (mean 0.111), 96. 6% of grade 2 results were 0.278 109 cells/L (mean 0.086) 97.2% of grade 3 results were 0.242 109 cells/L (mean 0.066) and 97.5% of grade 4 results 0.140 109 cells/L (mean 0.026) classification of results within the reference range using granulocyte counts between 2.64 and 7.72 109 cells/L was correct 98.1% of the time but incorrectly included a grade 1 neutropenia result in 1.2% of cases. the equivalent grade 1 count (1.6\u20132.63 109 cells/L) was correct for 93.0% of its predictions but had a 2.6% chance of misclassifying a grade 2 neutropenia result. a threshold of 2.39 109cells/L could be used, missing only 49 of the 98652 patients with ANC 1.50 109cells/L. this is accompanied by a decrease in specificity (86.5%) and PPV (64.1%). using a granulocyte count threshold of 1.53 109 cells/L results in 100% specificity. grade 4 neutropenia results can be discriminated using a threshold of 0.62 109cells/L to give sensitivity 99.1%, specificity 99.3%, PPV 93.0% and NPV 99.9%. dataset restrictions Exclusion of patients with eosinophilia (0.4 109 cells/L) or basophilia (0.1 109 cells/L) improve the correlation of granulocytes to neutrophils with resulting R2 = 0.996 agreement analysis resulted in 94.4% agreement with a mean difference of 0.192 (upper limit 0.335) and 94.9% agreement with a mean difference of 0.122 (upper limit 0.174) correlation again improves with R2 = 0.989 and 0.978 for N0\u2013N1 and N2\u2013N4 neutropenia patients. eosinopenia ( 0.04 109 cells/L), 21,114 (4.2%) eosinophilia (> 0.4 109 cells/L), 50,311 (9.9%) basopenia (> 0.4 109 cells/L) and 21,365 (4.2%) basophilia (> 0.1 109 cells/L) correlation coefficients compared to the neutrophil count were found to be 0.997 for granulocytes. correlations improved upon transformation but overall they remained weak for eosinophils and basophils. all data pairs lie necessarily below the identity line and are highly concentrated around the regression line. 97.9% of results had granulocyte count not exceeding neutrophil count. sum of 7048 out of 331,977 eosinophil and basophil counts exceeded 0.600 109 cells/L. analysis on individual neutropenia grades revealed 97.0% of grade 1 results had a difference of less than 0.358109 cells/L. a relatively small mean difference for both the N0-N1 and N2\u2013N4 neutrophil result ranges was investigated. the complete dataset was randomly split into derivation (n = 167,853) and validation (n = 340,793) subsets on which a multinomial logistic regression classifier was trained and tested. the ability to correctly distinguish between N0-N1 results (1.5\u20137.5 109 cells/L) and N2-N4 neutropenia ( 1.50 109 cells/L) was assessed using various cut points. to achieve 100% sensitivity a threshold of 2.39 109cells/L could be used.
