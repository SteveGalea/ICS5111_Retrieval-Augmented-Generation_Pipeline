{"summary": "the quaternary prevention concept was born in Belgium in 1986. the concept started to diffuse at the World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca) congress in 1995. it is worth noting that the concept proposed by Leavell and Clarke in the 1940s was a disease-based one. the stages of prevention proposed are directly derived from the stages of syphilis studied by Clarke. the stages I have proposed are relationship-based and thus a co-construction between the doctor and the patient."}
