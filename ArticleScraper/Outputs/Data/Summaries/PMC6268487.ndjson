{"summary": "the most widely used method for protein analysis in basic research and clinical diagnostics is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the most widely used method for protein analysis in basic research and clinical diagnostics is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) beads can have larger surface areas than planar chips. bead-based arrays are more probable to detect target proteins. detection is faster and sensitivity is equal to or higher than that of ELISAs. fluorescence-encoded beads are prepared by entrapping fluorescent dyes into microbeads composed of polystyrene. polystyrene-based microbeads of 5.6-m size (xMAP microspheres) are used as carriers and stained with precise proportions. fluorescence-encoding has been widely used in biological applications. the red or orange fluorophores in the microbeads are measured by photoexcitation with a red-colored laser light for quantification of the target protein. the green fluorescence intensity reflects the amount of targets since the fluorescence comes from the secondary probes added after target capture to form sandwich immunoassayor hybridization like ELISA. 10,000\u201340,000 different types of coding beads can be created by using several QD colors and six intensity levels. so far, various techniques for embedding QDs into microspheres have been reported. the other approach to overcome the limited number of fluorescence-encoded beads is the use of localized fluorescence-encoded beads. 10 types of multi-layered fluorescence can be prepared with only two dyes. biotin and a RNA-aptamer are introduced to the multilayer fluorescence-encoded beads and monitored for their binding activities to the target molecules. label-free assays based on various tools such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), nanowires, nanohole arrays and interferometry. aptamer-based molecular beacons (MBs) [37] or polydiacetylene (PDA) [60] can be used with optically-beads, which can be analyzed in multiplex within the same sample. synthetic nucleic acid sequences were successfully recognized for three respiratory pathogens, including the SARS coronavirus in proof-of-concept experiments. however, there are several obstacles to overcome: unstable interactions, random attachment of MBs, and bulkiness of streptavidin. polydiacetylene-Coated coding beads PDA-based biosensors have attracted considerable attention due to their unique color change from blue to red. most PDA-based biosensors are prepared in form of free-floating vesicles of 100\u2013200 nm or planar chips. optically-encoded beads with fluorescence-based methods could evolve as a powerful label-free detection method in fields like separation using direct detection of ligand-target binding events. fluorescence-encoded beads are prepared by entrapping fluorescent dyes into microbeads composed of polystyrene. polystyrene-based microbeads of 5.6-m size (xMAP microspheres) are used as carriers and stained with precise proportions of red and orange fluorophores. the red or orange fluorophores in the microbeads are measured by photoexcitation with a red-colored laser light for quantification of the target protein. the green fluorescence intensity reflects the amount of targets since the fluorescence comes from the secondary probes added after target capture. nanocrystals with tunable fluorescence emission can overcome many problems of organic fluorescence-based beads. advantages include excitation in a broad range, narrow (20\u201330 nm) emission spectrum, photostability, high quantum yield of luminescence (20 times brighter) and good chemical stability. TentaGel amino resin is swollen in an aqueous HCl solution. then Fmoc-OSu in organic solvent is added to protect some parts of the amino groups from the shell surface. the rest of the amino groups are encoded with FITC or rhodamine. label-free techniques can be used to avoid the above-mentioned problems. many research groups are currently developing label-free planar chip assays. label-free protein detection with beads within fluidic platform has been reported. MBs are attached to beads by electrostatic or biotin-streptavidin interactions to detect nucleic acids in solution for multiplex detection. however, there are several obstacles to overcome: unstable interactions, random attachment of MBs, and bulkiness of streptavidin. the thrombin-bound apta-beacon beads were easily recognized by the appearance of fluorescence without any further labeling step. however, only several RNA aptamers have been reported for protein targeting. the known RNA aptamer sequence for targeting protein can be used for this method. several ligands and their immobilization methods have been reported for PDA functionalization. however, the combination of optically-encoded beads with fluorescence-based methods could evolve as a powerful label-free detection method.

FITC at 530 nm almost covered the SERS peaks. this overlap could be avoided by fluorescence photobleaching. the 4-MT SERS peaks were obtained after about 100 s. fluorescence-based detection and optically-encoded beads can provide a robust and efficient approach for setting up multiplexed assays. the combination of fluorescence-based detection and SERS materials could make bead-based assays more attractive in the medical and diagnostic fields. fluorescence-based label-free method will contribute to the expanded use of bead-based assays."}
