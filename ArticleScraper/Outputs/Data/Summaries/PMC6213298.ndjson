{"summary": "human CEACAM1 gene undergoes the most extensive alternative splicing, giving rise to 12 splice variants. the two major isoforms of the gene in humans and mice contain four extracellular domains and either a long or a short cytoplasmic tail. the other commonly expressed pair of splice variants of the gene contains two extracellular domains with either a long or short cytoplasmic tail. the short isoform of CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-S) can bind to calmodulin, tropomyosin, globular actin, annexin II, and polymerase delta interacting protein p38 (PDIP38) the different CEACAM1-isoforms are most frequently co-expressed by the same cell and their relative expression levels determine the outcome of cellular signaling. the most prominent and best-studied CEACAM1 isoforms are highlighted in a blue box. further 4-domain variants are found with a modified short cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-4S2) or a soluble isoform (CEACAM1-4C1). the protein is both structurally and functionally conserved in humans and rodents. in mice, four major isoforms exist that comprise the CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S isoforms. a strain-specific allelic variant (Ceacam1b; SJL/J mice) has been discovered. BGP-I serum level was considered a surrogate marker in various liver diseases. serum BGP-I is five- to tenfold higher in patients with cholestasis by comparison to 0.2\u20130.9 mg/L in healthy subjects. soluble CEACAM1 is strongly increased in the serum and urine of rats with liver disease. only the CEACAM1-specific A2-domain exhibits approximately 56% homology with other CEA family member domains. the expression pattern of human CEACAM1 has also been confirmed in rodents [31,47,48,49,50]. CEACAM1 is involved in hepatocyte differentiation and is a hallmark molecule inducing epithelial differentiation. it is initially down-regulated on the surface of hepatocytes, when cell proliferation peaks, but restored back to steady-state levels. after partial hepatectomy in healthy individuals, the liver regains its original mass within 7\u201310 days after this procedure. hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) regulates expression of cellular adhesion proteins in the developing mouse liver. loss of HNF4 totally abolishes expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1 in embryos. characterization of rat ceacam1 promoter revealed binding sites for other liver-specific factors. 1\u2019s expression is absent in transplantable hepatocellular carcinomas of the rat [17]. this prompted the hypothesis that coordination of cell growth depends on CEACAM1 expression. localization of CEACAM1 to cell-cell contacts requires its long cytoplasmic tail, whereas its targeting to the apical surface depends on the short cytoplasmic tail [63,64]. in human mammary gland formation, both the short and long isoforms of CEACAM1 are associated with lumen formation. expression of CEACAM1-4S in human mammary carcinoma cells re-introduces normal mammary gland differentiation and abolishes the malignant phenotype [70,71]. in poorer differentiated tumor areas, the expression of membranous CEACAM1 is weaker. loss of apical membranous CEACAM1 expression with concomitant shift to intra-cytoplasmic localization corresponds to decreased relapse-free survival of HCC after liver transplantation. a predominant expression of CEACAM1-L constitutes a risk factor for HCC recurrence, and that predominant CEACAM1-S expression inhibits recurrence of HCC. CEACAM1 was identified as a substrate of the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase in liver. but not in other insulin-sensitive tissues like skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. phosphorylation is regulated by Tyr1316 in the C-terminus domain of the insulin receptor subunit (IR) Phosphorylation of CEACAM1-L is also regulated by SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases that bind to phosphorylated Tyr488. CEACAM1-L binding to SHP-2 sequesters it to reduce its binding to insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), leading to sustained phosphorylation and prolonging insulin signaling along the IRS-1/Akt pathway. single-headed black arrows indicate a chain of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events by the indicated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IR), Ser/Thr kinases (PI3K/AKT) and SHP-2 phosphatase. kinase activity of IR is mandatory for receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis via clathrin coated pits/vesicles. studies on the mechanism of CEACAM1-mediated insulin action are amongst the first reports describing isoform-specific functions for alternative splice variants of the CEACAM1 protein [18,32] studies on the mechanism of CEACAM1-mediated insulin action are among the first reports describing isoform-specific functions for alternative splice variants of the CEACAM1 protein. hepatic steatosis in NAFLD is associated with elevated de novo lipogenesis with reduced VLDL-triglyceride output. hepatic steatosis in NAFLD is associated with elevated de novo lipogenesis with reduced VLDL-triglyceride output. the relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD remains a challenging hen-and-egg question. 25% of the world population are estimated to exhibit NAFLD. but the incidence of NASH varies among different ethnicities. this is consistent with the higher transcriptional level of lipogenic genes in the liver. fatty acids oxidation causing hepatic steatosis in addition to lipid redistribution to visceral adipose depots to be stored. lipolysis occurs and drives the flow of toxic FFAs from visceral fat into the liver. adipose-tissue-infiltrating bone-marrow-derived cells differentiate into proinflammatory M1-type macrophages. humans with hepatic steatosis exhibit reduced levels of hepatic CEACAM1 in a linear relationship with the severity of the disease. hepatocytes from obese humans and rat models of obesity and hepatic steatosis exhibit a decline in CEACAM1 levels. paralleling insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, fatty liver disease and disturbed energy homeostasis emerge (3). leptin resistance, elevation of hypothalamic FASN expression, hyperphagia and reduction of energy expenditure (2b/4) fuel the vicious cycle that ultimately contributes to the cardio-metabolic abnormalities in ceacam1-deficient mice. restoration of functional CEACAM1-L reversed all metabolic abnormalities caused by global deletion in ceacam1//liver+ mice. this includes hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and steatohepatitis. hepatic steatohepatitis is associated with impaired insulin clearance. CEACAM1: Regulating a cross-talk between the Liver and the Cardiovascular System. mice develop endothelial dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy with septal wall thickening, reduction in cardiac performance and disturbance of vasomotor activity. hepatic CEACAM1 expression is sufficient to maintain insulin and metabolic homeostasis. in nave lymphocytes, CEACAM1 undergoes rapid upregulation upon cellular activation. in granulocytes, CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen that controls granulopoiesis. in granulocytes, CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen that delays neutrophil apoptosis. the relative expression density of Cis homo- and heterodimers and isomers with either a long or short cytoplasmic domain determines the signaling outcome by CEACAM1. binding of pathogen-derived heteroligands can disrupt homodimeric CEACAM1 interactions and modulate downstream signaling. CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-L exert opposite roles in the control of T cell activation. the inhibitory form, CEACAM1-L, can interfere with T cell activation prior to CTLA-4. this indicates that the inhibitory form, CEACAM1-L, can interfere with T cell activation prior to CTLA-4, and is therefore an independent immune checkpoint regulator. signaling complex in CD8+ T cells depends on CEACAM1-L expression. binding to filamin A stabilizes the immunological synapse. CEACAM1-L can interfere with viral replication in human cytomegaly virus infection. mice exhibit a higher production of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines due to a lack of CEACAM1-L expression. ligation of CEACAM1 with MHV spike proteins blocks differentiation towards the Th1 type. TIM-3 is co-expressed with CEACAM1 during tolerance induction. mucosal immunity is affected by specific CEACAM1 isoform expression in the gut. in the intestines and gut-associated lymphoid tissues, predominance of CEACAM1-L isoform is found in humans and mice. this is important to note since CEACAM1-S-dependent T cell activation is important to elicit T cell subset education into TGF-expressing CD4+latency peptide+ T cells. intravenous injection of anti-CD3 antibodies did not produce this effect. induced apoptosis after T cell activation, thus leading to T cell deletion. mice expressing or over-expressing CEACAM1-S in their CD4+ T cell compartment showed increased diversity of their gut microbiota compared to controls. axis and aberrant gut permeability are important determinants in the emergence of metabolic dysfunction that cause or accompany liver inflammation in the metabolic syndrome, obesity, and NAFLD/NASH. the connection between the gut and the liver can contribute significantly to extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. however, immune-mediated liver inflammation and IBD can occur independently of each other and appear disconnected in their relative time courses. IL-2 controls the induction expansion of regulatory T cells and effector T cells via binding to high or low affinity IL-2 receptors. a novel antibody has been developed that allows selective targeting and expansion of Tregs by preferentially inducing STAT5 phosphorylation. the short CEACAM1 isoform can respond to IL-2R signaling with specific impact on T cell polarization. induction of intrahepatic regulatory T cells depends on IL-2 production by CEACAM1+CD4+ T cells. in CD4+CD25+ T cells, upregulation of CEACAM1-L is crucial to dampen T cell-borne hyperinflammation. initial IL-2 production by CEACAM1+CD4+CD25+ effector T cells is essential to induce appropriate CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cells in the liver. the induction of apoptosis depends on the interaction between CEACAM1-L long cytoplasmic domain and -catenin. it can be ablated by mutagenesis of critical residues within armadillo repeats. another negative regulator feedback loop that is missing in CEACAM1-deficient cells comprises the induction of CEACAM1 expression by IFN [230] CEACAM1-S and CEACAM1-L isoforms trigger T cell activation. NFAT nuclear translocation and transcription of Il-2 are initiated. phosphorylated STAT5 translocates into the nucleus. pSTAT5 controls the transcription of key functional Treg genes. the question mark downstream of CEACAM1-S indicates that direct activation and phosphorylation of NFAT by CEACAM1-S via potential physical interactions remains to be determined. studies in the fetal and regenerating rat liver revealed that CEACAM1 is first expressed in fetal liver on day 16 after gestation in the rat [53] CEACAM1 is down-regulated on the surface of hepatocytes, when cell proliferation peaks, but restored back to steady-state levels 15 days after partial hepatectomy. after partial hepatectomy in healthy individuals, the liver regains its original mass within 7\u201310 days after this procedure. loss of HNF4 causes three to fourfold downregulation of ceacam1 transcript expression. deletion totally abolishes expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1 in embryos. characterization of rat promoter revealed binding sites for other liver-specific factors. al polarity and differentiation depends on CEACAM1 expression. localization of CEACAM1 to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells requires its long cytoplasmic tail. targeting to the apical surface depends on the short cytoplasmic tail. in human mammary gland formation, both the short and long isoforms of CEACAM1 are associated with lumen formation. expression of CEACAM1-4S in human mammary carcinoma cells re-introduces normal mammary gland differentiation and abolishes the malignant phenotype. in poorer differentiated tumor areas, the expression of membranous CEACAM1 is weaker [72] a predominant expression of CEACAM1-L constitutes a risk factor for HCC recurrence. a predominant expression of CEACAM1-L inhibits recurrence of HCC. this is qualitatively comparable to prognosis estimation derived from assessment of tumor size 5 cm. pp120/HA4/ecto-ATPase was identified as a substrate of the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase in liver, but not in other insulin-sensitive tissues like adipose tissue. CEACAM1 is not phosphorylated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) upon insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding, consistent with the fact that CEACAM1 downregulates the mitogenic phosphatases that bind to phosphorylated Tyr488 bind to insulin receptor substrate-1. CEACAM1-L binding to SHP-2 sequesters it to reduce its binding to insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), leading to sustained phosphorylation and prolonging insulin signaling. single-headed black arrows indicate chain of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. kinase activity of IR is mandatory for receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis. hepatic insulin removal clears up to 80% of insulin released from pancreatic cells into the portal circulation. studies on the mechanism of CEACAM1-mediated insulin action are amongst the first reports describing isoform-specific functions for alternative splice variants of the CEACAM1 protein [18,32] studies on the mechanism of CEACAM1-mediated insulin action are amongst the first reports describing isoform-specific functions for alternative splice variants of the CEACAM1 protein. hepatic steatosis in NAFLD is associated with elevated de novo lipogenesis with reduced VLDL-triglyceride output. the relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD remains a challenging hen-and-egg question. this is rooted in the observation that NAFLD is emerging from multiple parallel hits and involves inflammation, lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, and gut leakiness and dysbiosis. 25% of the world population are estimated to exhibit NAFLD [107] but the incidence of NASH varies among different ethnicities. this is consistent with the higher transcriptional level of lipogenic genes in the liver. the activity of FASN in this tissue is almost undetectable under normal insulinemic conditions. adipose-tissue-infiltrating bone-marrow-derived cells release adipokines and chemokines. disturbance of the gut permeability barrier enhances the penetration of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) into the circulation that pre-program liver-resident immune cells. s from obese humans and rat models of obesity and hepatic steatosis exhibit a decline in CEACAM1 levels. hepatic CEACAM1 exhibits unique regulatory properties connecting insulin clearance and lipid metabolism to the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH. leptin resistance, elevation of hypothalamic FASN expression, hyperphagia and reduction of energy expenditure fuel the vicious cycle that ultimately contributes to the cardio-metabolic abnormalities in ceacam1-deficient mice. single-headed black arrows depict feedback loops pointing towards the connection between visceral obesity and adipose tissue inflammation on the one hand and hepatosteatitis (3.) and central control circuits in obesity (4.) liver-specific transgenic liver-specific CEACAM1 restoration. this includes hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and steatohepatitis. hepatic steatohepatitis is associated with impaired insulin clearance. endothelial dysfunction caused by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia in Ceacam1/ mice. hepatic CEACAM1 expression is necessary and sufficient to maintain insulin and metabolic homeostasis. CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen that controls granulopoiesis and delays neutrophil apoptosis. it is generally associated with protection against hyperinflammation that results from either inappropriate expansion of cellular precursors such as in dysregulated granulopoeiesis and neutrophilia. CEACAM1-mediated effects on cellular activation, proliferation and cytokine production are controlled by several factors. the focus in this section will be on CEACAM1-mediated control in T cell activation and the induction of regulatory T cells and its implications in hepatic and mucosal immunity. CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-L exert opposite roles in the control of T cell activation. this indicates that the inhibitory form, CEACAM1-L, can interfere with T cell activation prior to CTLA-4. this indicates that the inhibitory form, CEACAM1-L, can interfere with T cell activation prior to CTLA-4. blockage of CEACAM1 homophilic binding suppresses cytolytic function elicited by TCR-signaling. CEACAM1-L interacts with -catenin that regulates Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. mice exhibit higher production of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines due to lack of CEACAM1-L expression. ligation of CEACAM1 with MHV spike proteins blocks differentiation towards the Th1 type. TIM-3 is co-expressed with CEACAM1 during tolerance induction during chronic viral infection in inflammatory bowel disease. a tissue-specific predominance of CEACAM1-L or CEACAM1-S isoform expression is found in intestines and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CEACAM1-L is the major CEACAM1 isoform expressed in T cells in extra-intestinal tissues. this is important to note since CEACAM1-S-dependent T cell activation is important to elicit T cell subset education into TGF-expressing CD4+latency mice expressing or over-expressing CEACAM1-S in their CD4+ T cell compartment did not exhibit alterations in their CD4+Foxp3+ Treg pool. the predominance of the CEACAM1-S isoform requires persistent exposure to mucosal antigens. this is required to confer robustness towards pathogenic enteropathogens, such as L. monocytogenes. the connection between the gut and the liver can contribute significantly to extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. immune-mediated liver inflammation and IBD can occur independently of each other. it is unknown whether mucosal T cells could travel to the liver to import tolerogenic or inflammatory signals. IL-2 controls the induction expansion of regulatory T cells and effector T cells via binding to high or low affinity IL-2 receptors. the high affinity receptor CD25 (the IL-2R chain) in the trimeric high affinity IL-2 receptor, is expressed in high levels and ensures efficient binding of IL-2 even if this cytokine is present in the microenvironment in very low amounts. a novel antibody has been developed that allows selective targeting and expansion of Tregs by preferentially in induction of intrahepatic regulatory T cells depends on IL-2 production by CEACAM1+CD4+ T cells. induction of intrahepatic regulatory T cells depends on IL-2 production. hepatocytes undergo TRAIL-dependent cell death [222,223]. in CD4+CD25+ T cells, upregulation of CEACAM1-S is crucial to dampen T cell-borne hyperinflammation. initial IL-2 production by CEACAM1+CD4+CD25+ effector cells is essential to induce appropriate CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cells in the liver. cytoplasmic domain and -catenin can be ablated by mutagenesis of critical residues within armadillo repeats. another negative regulator feedback loop that is missing in CEACAM1-deficient cells comprises the induction of CEACAM1 expression by IFN [230]. CEACAM1-S and the TCR complex trigger T cell activation. NFAT nuclear translocation and transcription of Il-2 are initiated. the molecular adaptors that relay CEACAM1-S signaling via NFAT1 have not been defined yet. phosphylated CEACAM1-L localizes ZAP-70 phosphatase to TCR. phosphorylation of NFAT by CEACAM1-S via potential physical interactions remains to be determined. CEACAM1 can support or inhibit tissue differentiation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. CEACAM1-L expression in T effector cells and neutrophils dampens inflammation. rescuing hepatic expression in a Ceacam1-deficient background suffices to restore metabolic homeostasis even under high-fat diet intake. however, the ubiquitous expression of CEACAM1 in humans poses a substantial challenge for the development of CEACAM1-directed therapeutics."}
