{"summary": "no artificial oxygen carriers or hemostatic agents have had the potential to replace manufactured red blood cell units or platelet concentrates donated by healthy volunteers. this \u2018natural source\u2019 inherently bears the risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens. stringent donor selection criteria and very sensitive and specific blood screening tests have substantially increased the safety margin for blood recipients. NAT assays for dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and west-nile virus (WNV) have been developed and are partly commercially available. this review focuses on the epidemiology and surveillance of arbovirus infections and their potential risk for blood safety due to the fact of an asymptomatic viremic phase. pathogen emerges either by de novo mutations or by crossing the species barrier to human beings. AIDS was first diagnosed in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma. two independent research groups published the discovery of a novel retrovirus as the causative agent in Science. more than 50 to 100 million individuals infected annually in more than 100 endemic countries worldwide. in these countries donor deferral is not an appropriate measure for prevention. protection from mosquito bites by wearing clothes is the only preventive measure. CHIKV causes a febrile illness with painful and sometimes long-lasting (up to years) arthralgia. the outbreak in la Reunion (2005 and 2006) affected nearly one third of the island population. the collapse of the regional blood supply was prevented by the import of blood components from France. six breakthrough WNV infections have led to a novel concept that provides a seasonal switch to a more sensitive individual donation NAT platform [48, 49]. Occasionally, WNV infections are missed due to a viral titer below the lower limit of detection, as recently reported by the center of disease control and prevention. the emergence of novel pathogens is rather unpredictable, although mathematical models suggest that every 5 years a new transfusion-transmissible infectious agent will emerge. the control of epidemics is of utmost importance and is kept under precautionary surveillance by national and international bodies. several emerging pathogens are likely transmitted by blood transfusion. deferral of blood donors is likely the best alternative to mitigate the risk of dissemination and its amplitude. in a case of very high incidence, this strategy implies the disadvantage of paralyzing, at least temporally, the blood supply. universally applicable technologies for robust pathogen inactivation may become acceptable strategies to circumvent such risks. two small outbreaks of transfusion-transmitted DENV in Hong Kong and Singapore have been published. the rate of asymptomatic DENV RNA-positive individuals was estimated to be 1:250 to 1:1,000 during DENV epidemic outbreaks. CHIKV causes a febrile illness with painful and sometimes long-lasting (up to years) arthralgia. the outbreak was limited to 205 patients and was caused by an infectious traveler. a widespread human-mosquito-human transmission cycle is deemed unlikely in Europe or the USA because the virus does not persist during cold temperature. there is a well-established socioeconomic framework in place, and there is an international surveillance network. a phylogeographic model was created based on WNV genome sequences of sampled organisms to reconstruct the spatiotemporal diffusion of WNV in North America [50] it is speculate that bird movements may be responsible for rapid, long-distance movements (1,000 km/year) of the virus. 2010 is the third consecutive year that human cases of WNV infections have been identified in northeastern Italy. the control of epidemics is of utmost importance and is kept under precautionary surveillance by national and international bodies. several emerging pathogens are likely transmissible by blood transfusion. this is true for known viruses with genomic mutations susceptible to immune escape mechanisms. inactivation may become acceptable strategies to circumvent such risks. these technologies will replace routine gamma-irradiation, bacterial testing, and CMV serology. these technologies will also replace routine gamma-irradiation, bacterial testing, and CMV serology. UV-A light exposure (320\u2013400 nm, 3 J/cm2) it robustly cross-links nucleic acids in an oxygen-independent manner. this action is independent of potential cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) the direct generation of superoxide anion and other ROS may make a reevaluation of the general toxicological assessment necessary. THERAFLEX UV technology for platelets does not rely on a photodynamic agent and is based exclusively on the force of narrow-bandwidth UV-C light (254 nm, 0.2 J/cm2, irradiation time 1 min), which induces the formation of pyrimidine dimers. the safety margin was calculated to be about 650\u20131,300-fold. all above mentioned PIT for platelets have passed the licensing procedure (e.g., CE mark) to introduce each medical device into the market. not yet Riboflavin + UV Mirasol TerumoBCT CE class IIb CE class IIb CE class IIb not yet October 2007 August 2008 Theraflex UV Macopharma CE class IIb alternative technology* not yet November 2008 II.

[90] and excluded the single RCT using Mirasol technology [100] remains questionable. there was no significant increase in RBC transfusions in recipients transfused with pathogen-inactivated platelets. the majority of patients suffered either a hematological malignancy with chemotherapy / stem cell transplantation or underwent cardiovascular surgery or solid organ transplantation. inferiority design was published by the Etablissement Francais du Sang. trap trial showed a non-inferiority margin of 20%. four patients in each study arm did not receive any transfusion. only small-sized observational platelet studies have been performed or are still ongoing in Spain, Luxembourg, Lithuania, and Serbia. antic et al. has published a CCI-1h of 12,000 and a CCI-24h of 4,900 based on 26 transfusions in 11 patients. most clinical experiences are available from more than 2 million transfusions using INTERCEPT-treated plasma (ca. 40%) and platelets (ca. 60%) in more than 20 countries. clinical data include experiences in neonates and pediatric patients. national hemovigilance data are also available from France (since 2006) and Switzerland (since 2011) study by Wandt et al. invites to rethink the prophylactic platelet transfusion strategy in some patients not at risk for increased bleeding complications (e.g., impaired by storage and ABO non-identical use) the minimal FDA requirements for fresh platelets are a mean recovery rate of 65% and a life span of 8 days. in 2004, a mean recovery of 84% (42.5 8.7% vs. 50.3 7.7%) and a lifespan of 80% were published for INTERCEPT-treated compared with non-irra-diated reference platelets suspended in PASIII [82]. the first results (n = 6) of a phase I study for the THERAFLEX UV technology were published. clinical evaluation Depending on the CE approval mark which enables the free movement of goods in the EU member states, the readiness for market introduction varies for the above mentioned PIT. the inTERCEPT device is a CE mark class III product (amotosalen) which requires the critical review of clinical data (e.g., inactivation efficacy, 7-day storage) by the Notified Body. 6,200 1,800 upper bound 95% CI 4,100 LRAc dose versus CI-1h 1.5 109/1 upper bound 95% CI 6.1 109 CCI-24hb 7,400 5,500/10,600 7,100 LRAc dose versus CI-24h, 2.6 109 any hemorrhagic event 79%/79% any severe hemorrhagic event 6%/6% post-transfusion hemostatic score: 0.28/0.30 acute transfusion reactions (6 h) 6% 80% power to detect CI 13109/1 or CCI-1h 5,250 linear regression analysis 43 patients 22/21 218 products 103/115 dose 4.1 1.2/3.8 0.4 storage 3.1 1.0 / 3.2 0.8 CI-1hb 23,800 18,500/31,200 15,500 7,400 upper bound 95% CI 17,900 LRAc dose versus CI-1h 7.2 109/l CCI-1h 11,600 7,300/15,100 6,400 CCI-24h 7,300 6,200 47 / 81 47 acute transfusion reactions 7%/13% TESSI Lozano et al. 2011 [90] INTERCEPT buffy coat (86%) apheresis (14%) T-sol or SSP, partly irradiated multicenter RCT, ITTf non-inferiority design 30% margin 211 patientse 101/98 dose: equally 4.2 storage: day 7 (80%) or day 6 CCI-1h 8,200 5,400 / 9,400 3-4 bleedings 10.7%/5.6% any adverse event 0.28 0.19 / 0.23 0.19 RCT = Randomized clinical trial;

p = 0.127), and the frequency of bleedings was too low (n = 6 (test) vs. n = 3 (reference); p = 0.490) to evaluate the clinical safety profile in terms of bleeding complications. the PREPAReS study is ongoing and has to recruit more than 600 patients receiving Mirasol-treated platelet concentrates suspended in 100% plasma. most clinical experiences are available from more than 2 million post-marketing transfusions using INTERCEPT-treated plasma (ca. 40%) and platelets (ca. 60%) in more than 20 countries. the clinical data include experiences in neonates and pediatric patients. ent\u2019 variability of conventional platelet concentrates (independent of the type of PIT used) must be noted. this can be reasonably explained in terms of platelet content by the \u2018biological source\u2019 and in terms of clinical efficacy by either the natural aging of platelets during storage or non ABO-identical use. Cerus has developed a novel platform technology (2nd generation) that is based on the addition of the chemical compound S-303 (0.2 mmol/l) and glutathione (GSH; 20 mmol/l) as a quencher. the non-reactive, negatively charged breakdown product S-300 is formed and rapidly degraded. the 2nd generation of S-303 did not induce antibody formation. the 24-hour recovery at day 35 was excellent, with a mean of 88.0 8.5%.
