{"summary": "the one health initiative is premised on the principle that the health of the Earth's people is connected to the health of its animals and of the environment. it is premised on the principle that the health of the earth's people is connected to the health of its animals and of the environment. the initiative dates from 2007, when a formal bond was established between the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) agents that originate in wild animals then spread human to human. agents that move from wild to domestic animals then go on to be transmitted between humans. framework II vaccines are to be used in domesticated animals to prevent disease in both animals and humans. development of the live spore vaccine that is still used significantly reduced its incidence in livestock worldwide after 1937. humans are usually infected via exposure to infected livestock and to carcasses of wild animals, especially in africa and other developing areas. the control, and possibly even the global elimination of rabies virus disease, is also a good one health test case. candidate pandemic virus vaccines have been made to the scale of 10 million doses in less than a month. so too has efficacy to heterologous challenge with high pathogenicity avian influenza strain H5N1 in chickens. intraperitoneal immunisation of mice with purified extracts of transgenic tobacco elicited comparable levels of immune response to the inactivated conventional vaccine. sheep were protected from live virus challenge by oral immunisation with a single dose of transgenic maize kernels containing 2 mg of G protein. several plant-made antigens have been shown to have potential. one approach was expression of an Ebola immune complex (EIC) in N benthamiana. transgenic tobacco plants expressed an ER-targetted VP40 at levels of 3 mg/kg fresh weight of plant tissue. both proteins are candidate vaccines, and candidate low-cost reagents for ebolavirus diagnostic kits. this was the production and eventual accelerated clinical trial of the humanised mAb cocktail known as ZMappTM by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. the need for reagents is exemplified by a recent large study of seroprevalence in humans in Nigeria against the tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever bunyavirus. routine detection of antibodies in animals or in humans to CCHFV is done using the nucleoprotein (N) in ELISA tests. NP detected anti-CCHFV IgG in all positive serum samples. all negative serum samples gave results below the cut-off value. recombinant NP expressed in plants has significant potential for use in diagnosis and surveillance. west Nile flavivirus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen in the same family as zika, yellow fever and dengue viruses. a potentially useful vaccine candidate consisting of the domain III of the E glycoprotein was produced by ER-targetted transient expression in N benthamiana at levels of 73 mg/kg. it was easily purified, bound MAbs recognizing a conformational epitope of the native protein, and elicited a potent new concerns over the interaction of dengue and other flaviviruses and in particular Zika virus have prompted caution over its use. for this reason, subunit vaccines consisting of E protein DIII \u2013 similar to the WNV example above \u2013 have been trialled in monkeys. however, as with any other protein vaccine, production will probably be expensive. mAb neutralizes all 4 serotypes of the virus:49 a problem with production in mammalian cells. production of the mAb by agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression in N benthamiana abrogated ADE activity without affecting antigen binding and neutralisation efficiency against DENV serotypes 2 and 4. the application of plant-made proteins as inexpensive reagents could revolutionise point-of-care diagnostics, for example. the application of plant-made proteins as inexpensive reagents could also make universal vaccination of livestock against certain diseases a reality. candidate pandemic virus vaccines have been made to the scale of 10 million doses in less than a month. so too has efficacy to heterologous challenge with high pathogenicity avian influenza strain H5N1 in chickens. intraperitoneal immunisation of mice with purified extracts of transgenic tobacco elicited comparable levels of immune response to the inactivated conventional vaccine. sheep were protected from live virus challenge by oral immunisation with a single dose of transgenic maize kernels containing 2 mg of G protein. accelerated licensure and testing threw up several likely candidates. but one real success in recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus. subunit vaccines may yet be useful, for ebola- and marburgviruses. ER-targetted VP40 was given orally or subcutaneously to BALB/C mice in 3 low-dose preparations. both proteins are candidate vaccines, and candidate low-cost reagents for ebolavirus diagnostic kits. this was the production and eventual accelerated clinical trial of the humanised mAb cocktail known as ZMappTM by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. reagents for some of the world's more dangerous zoonotic pathogens are expensive and hard or dangerous to make. a recent study of seroprevalence in humans against the tick-borne crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever bunyavirus (CCHFV) in south africa, routine detection of antibodies in animals or in humans to CCHFV is done using the nucleoprotein (N) in ELISA tests. the results suggest that recombinant NP expressed in plants has significant potential for use in both diagnosis and surveillance. another innovative approach was the expression of a synthetic CCHFV envelope glycoprotein precursor (GcGn) polyprotein in leaves and induced hairy roots of transgenic tobacco plants. the material was immunogenic in mice via oral or parenteral immunisation routes. west Nile flavivirus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen in the same family as zika, yellow fever and japanese encephalitis viruses. the virus is transmitted regularly to livestock and to humans and can cause severe disease. new concerns over the interaction of dengue and other flaviviruses and in particular Zika virus have prompted caution over its use. subunit vaccines consisting of E protein DIII - similar to the WNV example above - have been trialled in monkeys, with good efficacy shown. however, as with any other protein vaccine, production will probably be expensive. mAb neutralizes all 4 serotypes of the virus:49 a problem with production in mammalian cells. production of the mAb by agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression in N benthamiana, however, abrogated ADE activity without affecting antigen binding and neutralisation efficiency against DENV serotypes 2 and 4. the application of plant-made proteins as inexpensive reagents could revolutionise point-of-care diagnostics, for example. molecular farming could allow more routine application of therapeutics in veterinary medicine, given the low cost of goods and the potential for oral dosing. the Biopharming Research Unit is presently funded for human papillomavirus vaccine development by Medicago Inc. of Canada. it receives patent licensing fees from Medicago."}
