{"summary": "the government is bucking the trend and lowered its duties on wine and beer by 50 percent in 2007. the aim of this paper is to examine the case of Hong Kong with its history of changes in alcohol taxation to explore the factors that have driven such an unprecedented policy evolution. the global alcohol industry is continuing to rapidly expand into emerging markets with few or no alcohol control policies and regulations. the industry has a huge capacity to market alcohol and promote drinking as part of an acceptable and \u201chealthy\u201d lifestyle. the world health organisation suggests that alcohol taxation be a part of government efforts to regulate alcohol consumption. a recent government report shows that there was an increase of four percentage points in the prevalence of drinking among the adult population in Hong Kong. the proportion of frequent binge drinkers increased from 35.0 percent in 2004 to 45.5 percent in 2011. the nature of public policy making can be understood within a broad political context. this paper begins with an account of major amendments to alcohol tax legislation in 2000\u20132008. it examines how the alcohol industry sought to strategically advance its vested interests to lower and eventually eliminate the beer and wine duty in Hong Kong. it concludes by raising some questions concerning Hong Kong\u2019s alcohol tax policy changes for future public health research and intervention. the HKWSIC proposes to exempt the duties on wine and beer and all other alcoholic beverages except spirits. 2008 June amendment of dutiable Commodities Ordinance Cap. 109 provides for suspension of the licensing/permit requirement for import/export. the alcohol industry refers to multinational alcohol producers and wholesalers as well as retailers (off-sales) and hospitality sectors (on-sales) that sell alcohol products within Hong Kong. in total, 198 documents were retrieved. consolidated deficit of HK$ 65.6 billion (US$ 1 = HK$ 7.80) for 2001\u201302. then-Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said he felt pressured because \"Hong Kong must overcome the difficulties spawned by the economic downturn\" the tax increase would generate additional revenue of HK$ 90 million each year. the local wine industry urged the government to reconsider its proposal. despite the industry\u2019s vigorous lobbying, the government was initially resistant to the industry\u2019s opposition primarily because alcohol tax was seen as a \u201cstable source of government revenue\u201d the tax rate on alcoholic beverages remained intact until the first half of the 2000s. one was the robust economic rebound despite the severe economic fallout. the alcohol industry incessantly lobbied the government to lower the alcohol tax rate. a lowered duty on wine would boost tourism and further strengthen Hong Kong's image as a wine distribution centre. the central idea was that a wine tax cut would encourage more investment from international wine traders. in 2000, then-Financial Secretary Donald Tsang mentioned that Hong Kong had great potential as a wine hub. alcohol industry had high hopes to lower the tax on alcohol by at least half. coalition urged the government to lower the tax on alcohol by at least half. industry elected to work closely with local media in an attempt to garner public support. the alcohol tax was an unfair form of taxation [46]. the coalition\u2019s opposition to alcohol duties was based on the protection of their commercial interests. the industry attempted to build public support for its position by defining the alcohol duties as a threat to employment and the local economy. a small number of lawmakers and commentators expressed concerns about the negative effects of alcohol tax reduction. despite a few similar calls for the institution of alcohol taxation to play a bigger role as part of public health and alcohol control measures, the message has not been effectively communicated. taxation on all forms of alcohol except spirits would be lowered by 50 percent with immediate effect, costing the government HK$ 350 million per year. the duty on beer and other types of liquor containing no more than 30 percent alcohol was reduced to 20 percent from the previous 40 percent. the wine duty was adjusted to 40 percent from the previous 80 percent. the lack of civil participation in creating policy dialogues and raising concerns about alcohol tax reduction lies in stark contrast to the vociferous mobilization and lobbies driven by the industry. a low alcohol tax might lead to a higher availability of alcoholic drinks, which in turn would potentially increase alcohol consumption. the pro-business liberal party has been a key force behind the idea that drinking wine is healthy. at the heart of this move stood Party Chairman James Tien Pei-Chun. he called for further tax cuts on wine. the alcohol industry employed instruments including reports, conferences, meetings, opinion pieces. a new regulation that eased permit controls was implemented in 2008. it removed the need to obtain licenses and permits to sell liquor with less than 30 percent alcoholic strength and wine, thus creating a more conducive commercial environment. the government did not accept the proposal on the grounds that the current system is simpler and fairer and is in line with the ability to pay principle. the government stated that any reform to the current system should avoid any regressive effects and other possible unfair situations between products of different price ranges. tax increase would generate more revenue of HK$ 90 million each year. he said the tax increase would generate an additional HK$ 70 million each year. the alcohol industry\u2019s perspective, the tax represents a direct menace to their continued prosperity. despite the alcohol industry\u2019s vigorous lobbying, the government was initially resistant to the industry\u2019s opposition. alcohol tax had contributed approximately 0.4 to 0.5 percent of the government\u2019s total revenue annually from early 2000 to 2005. despite the industry\u2019s political pressure and strong resistance, the government was initially resistant to the industry\u2019s opposition. the alcohol industry incessantly lobbied the government to lower the alcohol tax rate. over the years, the alcohol industry incessantly lobbied the government to lower the alcohol tax rate. the alcohol industry sought out industry allies such as the hospitality and trading industries and forged agreements with them. a lowered duty on wine would boost tourism and further strengthen Hong Kong's image as a wine distribution centre. the central idea was that a wine tax cut would encourage more investment from international wine traders, which would in turn result in more employment and economic growth. alcohol industry had high hopes to lower the tax on alcohol by at least half. the coalition urged the government to lower the tax on alcohol by at least half. a local newspaper cited legislator Tommy Cheung\u2019s remarks that the high alcohol tax threatened to harm employment. the industry tried to build public support for its position by defining the alcohol duties as a threat to employment and the local economy. the liberal party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong supported the move. a small number of lawmakers and commentators expressed concerns about the negative effects of alcohol tax reduction. despite a few other similar calls for the institution of alcohol taxation to play a bigger role as part of public health and alcohol control measures, the message has not been effectively communicated. the duty on beer and other types of liquor containing no more than 30 percent alcohol was reduced to 20 percent from the previous 40 percent. the wine duty was adjusted to 40 percent from the previous 80 percent. there were little, if any, concerns raised from public health experts and civil society organizations. social and public health issues surrounding alcohol taxation were given little attention. a professor of public health warned that a low alcohol tax might lead to a higher availability of alcoholic drinks, which in turn would potentially increase alcohol consumption. in 2007, retained imports of red wine amounted to US$ 102.9 million. the alcohol industry employed a variety of instruments to articulate the rationale for alcohol tax elimination. the coalition claimed abolishing the wine duty would generate HK$ 4 billion a year in sales and related businesses such as wine storage and fine wine actions. the government HK$ 560 million annually in lost revenues [66] effective 6 June 2008, a new regulation that eased permit controls was implemented under the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance [67] this policy removed the need to obtain licenses and permits to sell liquor with less than 30 percent alcoholic strength and wine. a bottle of wine will now be cheaper in Hong Kong than anywhere else in Asia. alcohol industry's tactics and strategies were clearly the main drivers of the policy decision. alcohol industry lobbying as a whole was not tightly integrated and coherent right from the beginning. the first tactic was to forge a new coalition. the coalition was able to achieve such unprecedented success. the coalition needed to develop an appropriate blend of ideas to lobby for the abolition of taxes on alcohol. the coalition maintained that Hong Kong should be the region\u2019s centre for wine exhibition, trading and logistics. alcohol tax policy in Hong Kong was interpreted and formulated solely in the trade arena rather than in the domain of public health. alcohol tax policy in Hong Kong was interpreted and formulated solely in the trade arena rather than in the domain of public health. the alcohol industry assumes the key role in policy making in the absence of strong civil and public health advocacy. it is important to debunk the alcohol industry\u2019s misleading narratives, and to critically assess the impact of the Hong Kong government\u2019s policy decision on the zero alcohol tax. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors read and approved the final manuscript. authors would like to thank a medical student of the university
