{"summary": "weather is expected to become more extreme and variable due to acceleration of the water cycle caused by atmospheric heating. altered pressure and temperature patterns, caused by global warming, may also shift the distribution of when and where extreme water-related events usually occur. the area affected by drought is thought to have increased since the 1970s. waterborne diseases are expected to rise with increases in extreme rainfall and deterioration in water quality following wider drought events. there is also limited information available on how different extreme water-related weather events will impact different geographical areas and pathogens. this is the first global systematic review of the impact of weather on waterborne disease. the titles, key words and abstracts of articles included in the online databases were searched for these search terms. it was not possible to search the full texts as not all citations had been indexed and scanned into the online databases. the grey literature was also searched on 12 May 2010 using the program for monitoring emerging diseases. xsackievirus;

without abstracts or key words may not have been identified on the basis of their title alone. this was due to relying on authors mentioning the extreme water-related weather event in either the title, abstract or key words to enable them to be identified. limited reporting of many of the included studies also prevented many conclusions being drawn. future research should aim to measure and report clearly population, weather and water parameter details when investigating waterborne disease outbreaks. rhoeal disease outbreaks have previously been found to be higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries. rhoeal disease outbreaks are rarely thought to result in epidemics of infectious disease or, where they do occur, often be easily controlled and not widespread due to rapid implementation of preventative measures. climate change is predicted to increase the burden of diarrhoeal disease in low-income regions by about 2\u20135% by 2020. countries with an annual GDP per capita of US$6000 are thought to be at no additional risk. however, responses to recent extreme weather events suggest higher levels of vulnerability in both developing and developed countries than thought previously. studies have linked waterborne disease with heavy rainfall in several countries. cyclones, other severe storms, ENSO events, or seawater inundation result in the highest number of cases of waterborne illness. rainfall and flooding were the most common risk factors globally. the number of cholera outbreaks reported following extreme water-related weather events may also be attributable to a number of other factors such as the severity of the disease or reporting bias. human and social capital are key determinants of adaptive capacity at all scales. waterborne diseases are one of the major contributors to global disease burden and mortality [40] there is also a lack of information on available and successful extreme water-related weather-event adaptation strategies. research into the impact of waterborne outbreaks following extreme weather events on different sub-populations which may be particularly vulnerable. hygsup.zip (43KB, zip) click here to
