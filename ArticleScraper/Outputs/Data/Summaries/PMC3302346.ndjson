{"summary": "alphavirus particle is comprised of two concentric protein shells, the glycoprotein spikes and the nucleocapsid core, separated by a lipid membrane. the outer protein shell consists of 80 trimeric, glycoprotein spikes embedded in a host-derived lipid membrane. the spikes are trimers of E2 and E1 protein heterodimers (7, 26, 66) enzyme signalase cleaves polyprotein into E3-E2 (also known as p62), 6K, and E1 (28, 68) in the ER, pE2 and E1 associate into heterodimers, three of which oligomerize to form nonfusogenic spikes (30, 31, 41) the nonfusogenic spikes are then transported through the Golgi network to the plasma membrane via the host's secretory system. cleavage of E3 from pE2 by the cellular enzyme furin is necessary for rendering the nonfusogenic spikes fusion competent. inappropriate or untimely pE2 cleavage could cause the spikes to prematurely convert from the stable conformation to the meta-stable, fusion-competent conformation. BHK-21 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. the virus strains used in this work were the TE12 strain of SINV (33) and the T48 strain of RRV (25). the cells were mixed with in vitro-transcribed RNA in a 2-mm-gap cuvette. the cells were pulsed twice at 0.4 kV, 25 F, and 800 using the bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system. at 25 h postelectroporation, the medium was harvested and spun at 3,500 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cells and cell debris. RT mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate was added to each sample. cDNA prepared as described above (2 l) was mixed with 1 Brilliant SYBR green reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 250 nM forward the cell lysates were solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. the cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with polyclonal antibodies recognizing pE2/E2 and capsid (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA) the 15-min incubation, 50 Ci/ml [35S]cysteine-methionine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was added to the medium. cell surface proteins were biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature. the biotin solution was prepared in PBS immediately before use. antibodies recognizing pE2/E2 and capsid (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA) band intensities were quantitated using ImageQuant software. samples purified by pelleting through a 27% sucrose cushion (3 l) were applied to a formvar- and carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid. stained grids were analyzed using a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. radiolabeled virus was solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. band intensities were quantitated using imageQuant software. BHK-21 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. all mutations in the TE12 cDNA clone and the T48 cDNA clone were introduced. the cells were diluted 1:10 in BHK cell medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. at the indicated time points, virus was harvested and titer was determined using standard plaque assay procedure (46). at the indicated time points, virus was harvested and titer was determined using standard plaque assay procedure (46). the samples were incubated at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and 70\u00b0C for 5 min. RT mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate and ImProm-II reverse transcriptase was added to each sample. -21 cells were electroporated with in vitro-transcribed wild-type or mutant viral RNA. at 18 h postelectroporation, the cells were fixed with freshly prepared 1.5% paraformaldehyde. at 18 h postelectroporation, the cells were fixed with freshly prepared 1.5% paraformaldehyde. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 15 min. 50 Ci/ml [35S]cysteine-methionine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was added to the medium. cell surface proteins were biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. resuspended particles were solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. resuspended particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 50 Ci/ml [35S]cysteine-methionine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was added to the medium. the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. radiolabeled virus was solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. pH with 0.1 M morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 0.2 M acetic acid buffer. pH was adjusted to pH 7.4 with a pretitrated volume of 1 M NaOH. the neutralized samples were solubilized in nonreducing SDS sample buffer. the formation of SDS-resistant E1 trimers was assayed using SDS-PAGE. a virus E2-E1 heterodimer (57) is colored in blue. the E1 glycoprotein is colored in red. there are 4 conserved Cys residues in the E2 ectodomain that are not part of a C-(X)1-5-C motif. further analysis shows multiple repeats of C-(X)1-5-C, which is a motif shared by many redox proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (65, 67). each of the SINV and RRV E2 Cys mutants was reduced in titer compared to the parental virus. in contrast, growth of the RRV E2 Cys mutants was divided into two groups. in one group, RRV C22S and RRV C201S were reduced in titer by 4 log units compared to wild-type RRV. growth curves of the RRV E2 Cys mutants., wild-type RRV;, RRV E2 C19S;, RRV E2 C22S;, RRV E2 C220S. the total number of particles produced, both infectious and noninfectious, was determined. the ratio of total number of particles/total number of infectious particles was 2 to 4 log units higher for each of the E2 Cys mutants than wild-type virus. if multicored particles are formed, there could hypothetically be five nucleocapsid cores per virion. however, the several-log-unit increase in particle-to-PFU ratio observed for each of the E2 Cys mutants suggests that only a small percentage of the released virions were competent to infect cell lysates were solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with polyclonal antibodies recognizing pE2/E2 and capsid by Western blot. migration of pE2, E2 and capsid bands indicated to the right of each blot. mutants in RRV, RRV C19S and C22S showed predominantly pE2 in cell lysates. differences in pE2 and E2 glycoprotein quantities were also seen in domain B mutants. the reduced amounts of E1/E2 at the plasma membrane may impact virus assembly in several ways. released particles may also be less stable than wild-type particles. the released particles may also be less stable than wild-type particles. biotinylated proteins were purified from cell lysates using streptavidin resin. eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. migration of spike glycoprotein bands is indicated to the right of each image. wild-type and pE2 virus are shown as controls for migration of E2 and pE2 bands. each of the pelleted SINV E2 Cys mutants contained an abundance of capsid over E2 suggesting the presence of multicored particles. wild-type (WT) and mutant viruses were purified from medium. pelleted particles were resuspended in HNE buffer. purified particles were solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. pelleted particles were analyzed by negative-stain TEM. spherical particles were 70 nm in diameter, which is consistent with previous results (7, 66) both SINV C19S and SINV C220S predominantly produced large, pleomorphic particles. the Cys mutations in E2 may cause improper spike organization. interactions between E2 and the nucleocapsid core could be disrupted. host-cell proteins may be incorporated into the mutant virions. radiolabeled virus was purified from the medium through a 27% and 60% sucrose step gradient. the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. virions purified via a step gradient showed an abundance of capsid protein. the siNV E2 Cys mutants contain E1 trimers in the released virus particles. TEM looked at the ability of the mutant particles to undergo E1 trimerization. spikes undergo a major conformational change as E1 trimers form and fusion occurs. radiolabeled wild-type (A and B) or mutant (C to F) virus was mixed with 0.8 mM liposomes. after 5 min, the virus-liposome mixture was pH neutralized and solubilized with nonreducing SDS sample buffer. the neutralized samples were either boiled at 95\u00b0C or not boiled ( lanes) prior to loading onto the gel. trimers of E1 were present in purified SINV E2 Cys mutant particles. in the absence of liposomes, there was a complete loss of the E1/E2 monomer band. premature trimer formation would render spikes fusion incompetent and virus noninfectious. atomic structure of two alphavirus E2 glycoproteins is similar to that of CHIK E2. cleavage in a manner similar to that of CHIK E2, except for domain B. in panel B and panel C, domain A is colored in green. in panel C, the presumed location of domain B is indicated with a gray oval. disulfide bonds in the E2 ectodomain are in blue bold. -5-C motifs were used to determine how folding intermediates affected the assembly and function of alphavirus particles. there are 4 conserved Cys residues in the E2 ectodomain that are not part of a C-(X)1-5-C motif. in our mutants, we have one free, unpaired Cys residue. growth of the RRV E2 Cys mutants was divided into two groups. in one group, RRV C22S and RRV C220S were reduced in titer by 4 log units compared to wild-type RRV. the second group contained viruses, RRV C19S and RRV C201S. the experiments to obtain growth curves were performed twice for each mutant. wild-type RRV and RRV had plaque sizes that were 3 to 4 mm in diameter at 36 h postinfection. Viruses with Cys mutations in domain A of E2 (SINV C201S, RRV C201S, SINV C220S, and RRV C220S) had plaque sizes that were less than 1 mm in diameter. several-log-unit increase in particle-to-PFU ratio observed for each of the E2 Cys mutants suggests only a small percentage of the released virions were competent to infect a new cell. pE2 cleavage is necessary to make the viral spikes fusion competent for entry into a new cell. id bands are indicated to the left of each blot. for wild-type SINV and RRV, approximately equal amounts of pE2 and E2 were observed. levels of capsid are shown in all samples as a loading control. pE2 and E2 were detected in all of the mutants except SINV C16S. pE2 and E2 were detected 5 to 10 h later than in wild-type SINV. pE2 and E2 were detected 5 to 10 h later than in wild-type SINV. cells were incubated in l-methionine- and l-cysteine-free medium for 15 min. after 15 min, [35S]cysteine-methionine was added to the medium. cells were lysed with 2.5 mM NHS-LC-biotin. SINV C19S and RRV C22S represent viruses with mutations in domain A of E2. the mutants form large, misassembled particles. the mutants show reduced infectivity and, in some cases, atypical pE2 cleavage patterns compared to wild-type SINV and RRV. individual wild-type SINV capsid and E2 values were set to 1, which made the ratio of capsid/E2 equal to 1. both SINV C19S and SINV C201S showed 5 times higher levels of capsid and 10-fold less E2 glycoprotein relative to wild-type SINV. the pelleted particles were solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer. the solubilized particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with polyclonal antibodies recognizing pE2/E2 and capsid. the morphologies of the SINV C19S and SINV C220S mutants were similar to those of multicored particles observed by Ivanova et al. (19). TEM analysis revealed that the majority of the particles produced by RRV C22S and RRV C220S were similar in size to those produced by wild-type RRV. Virus was radiolabeled during infection to ensure only host-cell and viral proteins were labeled. step gradients were used to purify fragile particles that may have been damaged during pelleting through a sucrose cushion. the solubilized particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. for wild-type RRV and the RRV E2 Cys mutants, 5 107 to 4 108 particles were loaded onto the gel. Particle number was quantitated using qRT-PCR. in the endosome, the E2 and E1 heterodimers dissociate in response to a decrease in pH. the spikes undergo a major conformational change as E1 trimers form. if the spikes are misassembled, the pH requirements to form E1 trimers may be altered compared to those for wild-type virus (23, 50). the virus-liposome mixture was pH neutralized and solubilized with nonreducing SDS sample buffer. the neutralized samples were either boiled at 95\u00b0C or not boiled ( lanes) prior to loading onto the gel. a portion of the E1 glycoprotein present on the particle surface was in the trimeric state. in the absence of a host-cell membrane, premature trimer formation would render the spikes fusion incompetent and the virus noninfectious. cleavage of E3 from E2 is required to render spikes fusion competent. mutation in E2 could affect virus binding to a host cell, spike assembly, spike maturation, and spike disassembly during entry. mutants were defective at several stages of virus life cycle. m diam No pH dependent RRV C22S A Predominantly pE2 Capsid > E2 Single cored Yes Unclear a WT, wild type. different particle morphologies observed between the SINV and RRV E2 Cys mutants. mutants produced large, multicored particles that appeared to contain host-cell proteins. in the SINV E2 Cys mutants, some of the E1 glycoprotein was present in a trimeric form on the particle surface. a mutation in one virus has a different outcome when the corresponding mutation is made in another species. in reoviruses, the virus is sensitive to ammonium chloride treatment and protease treatment. the different phenotypes observed in different virus species may be more common than reported. the phenotypes that we observed for the SINV and RRV E2 Cys mutants led us to propose that the chaperones that regulate E2 folding and function could be virus species specific. association constants, covalent interactions, and cleavage requirements may be species specific."}
