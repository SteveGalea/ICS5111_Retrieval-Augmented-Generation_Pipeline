{"summary": "a total of 2153 specimens from 362 infants were studied; 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections. 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months and at 9 months if the subjects still remained in the study. the swab was then placed in a 1-mL tube of a flocked swab (FLOQSwabs; COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) until resistance was met. a high-throughput, quantitative, real-time, reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to detect rhinovirus in respiratory specimens. cDNA templates were evaluated by using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with primers amplifying the 5\u2032 untranslated region of rhinovirus. 12.5 L of iQ supermix (Bio-Rad) was mixed within a 25-L PCR reaction containing 200 nM of both a biotinylated forward primer (biotin-TGGACAAGGTGCGAAGAGC) and a reverse primer (GGTTAGCCGCATTCAGGG) and 1 L of the rhinovirus qPCR amplimer15 and nuclease-free water to volume. phylogenetic analysis was performed by using specimens collected as part of a prospective study to determine the prevalence and risks of URI and acute otitis media (AOM) development in first year of life. subjects were enrolled from near birth (before 1 month of age) and followed to the first AOM episode. ngeal swab specimens introduced a flocked swab into the nose until resistance was met. the swab was then placed in a 1-mL tube of ESwab transport medium. the swab was then placed in a 1-mL tube of COPAN Diagnostics. pyrosequencing of rhinovirus 5\u2032 nontranslated region is a suitable approach for evaluation of short-term transmission. biotinylated forward primer (biotin-TGGACAAGGTGCGAAGAGC) and reverse primer (GGTTAGCCGCATTCAGGG) were mixed within a 25-L PCR reaction. PCR products were cloned by using a TOPO TA cloning kit. representative plasmids were purified from isolated bacterial colonies. of 362 infants, 54% were male, 76% were white, 23% were black. each of these 395 rhinovirus-positive specimens was considered 1 rhinovirus RNA isolate. follow-up specimens that were positive for the same rhinovirus strain were collected within 30 days. RT-PCR, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; RV, rhinovirus. 179 unique evaluable rhinovirus infections (in 134 infants) served as the sample set to assess prolonged presence of rhinovirus. there were an additional 46 infections that had follow-up specimens collected between 31 and 40 days, 22 that had follow-up specimens collected between 41 and 60 days, and 94 that had either no follow-up specimens or only specimens collected after 60 days. each specimen is represented by a solid black (I) or double (II) vertical hash marks. solid marks represent specimens collected during symptomatic URI. symptom patterns associated with the 8 cases of prolonged rhinovirus presence. additional respiratory viruses were frequently detected during the prolonged rhinovirus infections. a review of medical records of infants with prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA found no evidence of underlying conditions that are generally considered to result in persistent RV infections. half of repeated rhinovirus RNA events were 7 days in duration. only 8 of the 46 repeated rhinovirus RNA isolates were detected >30 days apart. repeated detection of rhinovirus RNA from infants is more likely to represent new infection than prolonged presence >30 days. tti et al8 studied serial rhinovirus infections in infants at risk of developing asthma. 1 of 150 (0.7%) was associated with the same rhinovirus strain detected at least 2 weeks apart. there is a paucity of information on rhinovirus RNA persistence. the longest interval between isolates was 91 days (subject 7, who was asymptomatic throughout) the most common pattern (3 cases) was asymptomatic throughout all isolates. the findings are consistent with reports of asymptomatic rhinovirus infections. infants often have repeated infections with different rhinovirus strains in the first year of life. detection of rhinovirus RNA by qRT-PCR most likely represents current or recent infection."}
