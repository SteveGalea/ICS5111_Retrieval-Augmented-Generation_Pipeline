{"summary": "the central interaction in adaptive immunity is between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen-presenting molecule loaded with a given antigen (Ag) the Ag-presenting molecules are encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) gene locus. the Ag could be a peptide, lipid, or metabolite (1). a pioneering study showed that TCRs using a V1 gene segment (termed /TCR) can be readily found in most humans and possess the specificity for both peptide- and lipid-based Ags presented by MHC class I molecules or CD1d. a long-standing question has dogged the field for decades: how does the limited set of available TCR genes combine to generate a T cell repertoire diverse enough to enable the recognition of highly polymorphic MHC alleles\" the overall binding modes of the S19-2 and TU55 TCRs resemble those of classical TCRs. the aromatic amino acids of the CDR1 loop exploit different conformations to accommodate distinct MHC helical scaffolds. this tolerance helps to explain how a particular TCR V region can similarly dock onto multiple MHC molecules. in vitro 51Cr release assays reveal that this clone displays strong killing of Nef138-10 peptide-pulsed cells. V1 was rearranged with J13 and C, while V30 was rearranged with DJ1.2 and C1. it happens that there is a similar case. a series of concentrations of the TCR (from 0.0625 to 8 M) was used to measure binding kinetics. affinities of both TCRs are among the highest in comparison to those of all classical TCRs measured to date. 2-Nef138-10 and TU55/HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9 complexes are very stable. they are bound to their disparate ligands, HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 and HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9. the interaction is moderately V centric (520 2 versus 570 2). further analyses of atom-to-atom contacts confirm these disparate interactions modes (226 versus 100 contacts and 125 versus 127 contacts, respectively) values in parentheses represent the values for the highest-resolution shell. the S19-2 TCR is shown in blue (hybrid chain VJC) and hot pink ( chain), and HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 is shown in orange (heavy chain), in yellow (2M), and in cyan (the peptide). the TU55 TCR is shown in light blue (hybrid chain VJC) and pink (chain), and HLA-B*3501 -2/HLA-A24 and TU55/HLA-B35 complexesa a The distance cutoff is 4.5. Conserved evolutionary CDR1 signature of V1 bound to different MHCs. analysis of atom-to-atom contacts revealed that the S19-2 TCR uses only four CDR loops to bind HLA-A24. the CDR1 loop contributes the most to the interaction. the values in parentheses represent the numbers of hydrogen bonds. the interactions between the loop and MHC converge on the 1 helix. TU55 TCR interactions with peptidesa a The Van der Waals cutoff distance is 4.5, and the hydrogen bond cutoff distance is 3.5. in the TU55/HLA-B35 complex, the residues of the CDR1 loop (S28, W29, and W30) display an aromatic-hairpin conformation and contact the residues of the 1 helix (E58, Y59, R62, N63, and Q65) CDR1 uses five residues (S28, W29, W30, S31, and Y33) to contact HLA-B35. residue W29 contributes the most atom-to-atom contacts. this phenomenon might be a result of adaptability to different platform residues in HLA-A24 and HLA-B35. the TU55 TCR uses both the CDR2 and CDR3 loops to contact the MHC. the CDR3 loop forms a much greater interaction with both the 1 and 2 helices in the TU55/HLA-B35 complex than with the ones in the S19-2/HLA-A24 complex. peptide recognition is dominated by hydrophobic interactions between the CDR3 loop and the peptide. the peptide is pressed downward in the S19-2/HLA-A24 complex, while the peptide is dragged upward by 1 in the TU55/HLA-B35 complex.

V1 was surprisingly found to pair with V30, whereas V30 was rearranged with DJ1.2 and C1. a series of concentrations of the TCR (from 0.0625 to 8 M) was used to measure binding kinetics. the affinity value of the S19-2 TCR for HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 is about 1.06 M. the affinities of both TCRs are among the highest in comparison to those of all classical TCRs measured to date. the complex structures of two V1-bearing TCRs, S19-2 and TU55, are very stable. they are bound to their disparate ligands, HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 and HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9. both are derived from cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones isolated from japanese HIV patients. the interaction is dramatically V centric (770 2 versus 290 2). the TU55/HLA-B35-Pol448-9 complex is moderately V centric (520 2 versus 570 2). further analyses of atom-to-atom contacts confirm these disparate interactions modes. 0.695 Ramachandran plot statistics Most favored (%) 94.7 86.2 Allowed region (%) 5.3 13.8 a RMS, root mean square. values in parentheses represent the values for the highest-resolution shell. interaction is moderately V centric (517.6 2 versus 574.1 2). atomic contacts in the S19-2/HLA-A24 and TU55/HLA-B35 complexesa a The distance cutoff is 4.5. Conserved evolutionary signature of V1 bound to different MHCs. five CDR loops (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, CDR2 and CDR3) of TU55 participate in binding. the CDR1 loop contributes the most to the interaction. in parentheses represent the numbers of hydrogen bonds. TU55 interactions with peptidesa a The Van der Waals cutoff distance is 4.5, and the hydrogen bond cutoff distance is 3.5. TU55 interactions with peptidesa a The Van der Waals cutoff distance is 4.5. the clone 12 TCR/HLA-B35 complex uses five residues (S28, W29, W30, S31, and Y33) to contact HLA-B35. residues of the CDR1 loop exhibit different conformations in the S19-2/HLA-A24 and TU55/HLA-B35 complexes. different CDR3 sequences and V chains affecting binding geometry. the TU55 TCR uses both the CDR2 and CDR3 loops to contact the MHC. the TU55 TCR has a slightly tilted binding geometry compared to the S19-2 TCR. the TU55 TCR has a slightly tilted binding geometry. the TU55/HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9 complex structure is dominated by hydrophobic interactions between the CDR3 loop and the peptide. both the S19-2 and TU55 TCRs use three CDR loops (CDR1, CDR3 and CDR3) to contact the peptide. the peptide and the CDR1, CDR3, and CDR3 loops in the TU55/HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9 complex structure were contoured at 1.0. the 1 helices of both the free and bound molecules were superimposed. clone 12, S19-2, and TU55 TCRs bind to disparate MHC molecules (HLA-A24 and HLA-B35) using different side-chain conformations to adapt to the local residue environment. the contribution of CDR1 loop residues to the recognition of the ligand was also highlighted by human TCR-CD1d-lipid antigen complex structures. apical \"hot spot\" position in the peptide can be achieved by a similar mechanism. we observed that the S19-2 and TU55 TCRs bind to their ligands through different binding modes. the differences in the CDR3 loop and pairing TCR chain contribute to specific binding.
