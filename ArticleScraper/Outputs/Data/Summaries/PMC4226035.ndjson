{"summary": "infants with pertussis were less often breastfeed than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (63.2% vs 89.5%; p 0.06). fewer infants with pertussis than controls had more episodes of whooping cough. pertussis resurgence in Europe has been attributed to incomplete immunization program or to genetic changes in Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) in some countries pertussis immunization is not mandatory and in others vaccination schedules suggest the first dose to be given at the age of 3 months. the standard diagnostic criterion for identifying B. pertussis is culture obtained from nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates. confirmatory information comes nowdays from molecular techniques such as real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the diagnosis is generally reached without microbiological confirmation. clinical outcome variables included gender, gestational age, birth weight, type of delivery, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis) vaccination received, breast feeding history, age and weight at admission, number of siblings, siblings\u2019 schooling, cough at admission, paroxysmal cough, presence of fever, apnea and cyanosis, chest sounds, and hospitalization days. all samples were delivered at room temperature within 1-2 hours to the Department of Infectious, Parasitic & Immune-mediated Diseases at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 Rome. all samples tested positive for B. pertussis were confirmed with the \u201cBordetella Real Time PCR\u201d kit (Diagenode, Belgium) ptxA, ptxP and prn were amplified in 50 l containing 5 l of PCR buffer 10X. ptxA and ptxP genes were amplified with 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s. the prn gene with 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. data were analyzed using the SPSS program (version 17.0) data were reported as median, range, mean, standard deviation, and percentage. data were reported as median, range, mean, standard deviation, and percentage. all infants underwent nasal pharyngeal washing with 3 ml of sterile saline injected in each nostril and collected with a syringe. all samples were delivered at room temperature within 1-2 hours to the Department of Infectious, Parasitic & Immune-mediated Diseases at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 Rome. s detection Pertussis was diagnosed using the Insertion Sequence (IS) IS481 and the ptxP gene as \u201ctarget\u201d genes. all samples tested positive for B. pertussis were confirmed with the \u201cBordetella Real Time PCR\u201d kit (Diagenode, Belgium) the specific primers and probes for detecting B. pertussis DNA were selected from the literature. the ptxA and ptxP genes were amplified with 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s. the prn gene with 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. the amino acid sequences resulting from the nucleotide sequences were compared using the DNAMAN program. no significant differences were found between infants with confirmed B. pertussis and control infants with RSV-bronchiolitis. the percentage of infants who were breast fed at hospitalization was lower in the group of infants with B. pertussis than in the one with RSV bronchiolitis. the percentage of infants with paroxysmal cough was significantly higher in infants with pertussis than in control infants. the percentage of infants with fever was significantly lower in infants with pertussis than in those with RSV bronchiolitis. pneumothorax arose in three of the 19 patients with pertussis (15.8%) and in only one of the 19 with bronchiolitis (p = n.s.) no significant differences were found between the two groups for chest radiograph findings. children with pertussis had higher absolute blood eosinophil numbers than children with RSV bronchiolitis. no significant differences were reported for absolute neutrophil numbers, absolute platelet numbers, SGOT, SGPT, GGT, and CRP. n.s. SGPT (UI/L) median (range) 31 (13-92) 23.5 (13-60) n.s. GGT (UI/L) median (range) 43 (13-166) 28 (7-117) n.s. RSV: respiratory syncytial virus; SGOT: Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; SGPT: glutamic pyruvic transaminase; SGPT: genetic analysis for the two cultured B. pertussis isolated Patient Age (months) Sex Vaccination Macrolide therapy ptxA ptx -P prn 1 1 F No No ptxA1 ptx-P3 prn-2 2 5 M No No ptxA1 ptx-P3 prn-2 ptxA1: pertussis toxin promoter; prn: pertactin. study confirms previous reports that many children with pertussis have never been vaccinated against pertussis. this finding confirms previous reports, showing that many children with pertussis have never been vaccinated against pertussis. study has questioned the role of B. pertussis and its toxin in the hyper-eosinophilia response to pertussis. in two pertussis isolates, we undertook genetic molecular analysis to investigate gene variation in the pertussis toxin gene (ptx), in particular its S1 subunit (ptxA), the pertussis toxin gene promoter (ptx-P), and prn[4-6]. nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens contained the variant ptx-P3, known as high-producing pertussis toxin. the isolates contained the variant ptx-P3, known as high-producing pertussis toxin. the median age at onset in 19 infants hospitalized for pertussis was low (around 70 days) authors declare that they have no conflict of interest, other than any noted in the covering letter to the editor. authors declare that they have no conflict of interest, other than any noted in the covering letter to the editor and non-financial competing interests. /13/526/prepub Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Cecilia Fazio who provided to culture and molecular study of collected samples."}
