{"summary": "a novel coronavirus associated with an acute respiratory disease in alpacas has previously been described. the virus was initially characterized as a Alphacoronavirus (CoV) based on gene sequencing of a small conserved region of the polymerase gene in the coV genome. the virus was initially characterized as a coV based on gene sequencing of a small conserved region of the polymerase gene in the coV genome. innate infidelity of RNA replication allows coronaviruses to jump host-species and adapt to new ecological niches. emergence of acute respiratory syndrome in alpacas is not well understood, though strong epidemiologic associations have been made between the virus and the emergence of an acute respiratory syndrome. this sequence is the putative region for a ribosomal frame shift, which creates ORF 1ab. a putative additional open-reading frame found between the nucleocapsid and 3'UTR, designated ORF \u201cX\u201d, was partially created by a 146 nucleotide insertion not present in HCoV-229E. the tree was created using a Neighbor Joining method with no out group. additional characteristics common to the ACoV and other alphacoronaviruses include the length of the genome, gene organization, a potential small ORF downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. gene similarities represent pairwise % identities calculated using the Clustal W method with the IUB cost matrix. b Amino acid similarities represent pairwise % identities calculated using the Clustal W method with the IUB cost matrix. nucleotide comparison of spike gene sequences from the ACoV and isolates of HCoV-229E covering a span of five decades was analyzed. the ACoV was observed to be most similar to HCoV-229E viruses isolated in the 1960\u2019s to early 1980\u2019s. ACoV genome (GenBank Accn. JQ410000) is comparable to other coronaviruses in genome length (ACoV consists of 27,362 bases), the presence of a poly-A tail and an overall 38.5% G+C content. the genome organization consists of six to sevenmajor ORFs and includes short untranslated regions (UTR) at both termini (Figure 1). accessory ORFs do not show homology to other viral or cellular sequences. their origin is unknown, and accessory ORFs do not seem essential for viral replication in tissue culture. the ACoV genome was compared with the genes from the previously described HCoV-229E gene. the nucleotide pairwise % identities ranged from 86.7%\u201394.2%. the amino acid pairwise identities ranged from 87.1%\u201395.0%. the pattern found in ACoV is essentially identical to the HCoV-229E spike protein. a basic amino acid cleavage site was not detected within the ACoV sequence. a nucleotide comparison of spike gene sequences from different coronaviruses was performed. the tree was created using a Neighbor Joining method with no out-group (Geneious Pro 5.0.3) the nucleocapsid protein, one of the most abundant viral proteins, is involved in replication processes, assembly and immunity during viral infection. 5 L of cDNA from a RT reaction was mixed with 9 L of water and 1 L of ACoV genome specific primer (20 M) then incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 1 minute, followed by placing the tube on ice for 1 minute. 4 L of 5 premix was added to the mixture along with 1 L of RT enzyme. the mixture was terminated by incubation at 90 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. RACE and 3' RACE DNA fragments representing the 5' and 3' ends of the ACoV genome were amplified using the firstChoice\u00ae RLM-RACE kit. the specific primer sets were designed to the full-length human coronavirus 229E sequence (GenBank accession # AF304460) some of the primer sequences contain mismatches when compared to the resultant ACoV genome. RT-PCR was performed using the MonsterScriptTM 1st-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) the reaction was terminated by incubation at 90 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. the cDNA was used immediately as a template for PCR. protocol of 95 \u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by 35\u201345 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u201360 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, 72 \u00b0C for 1\u20133 minutes, followed by a 7 minute elongation step at 72 \u00b0C. the specific annealing temperature and annealing times were fragment-specific and varied based on the calculated melting temperature for each primer set and the size of the fragment being amplified. alpaca coronavirus was isolated during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and associated abortions in alpaca in 2007. subsequent large outbreaks of the disease have not been reported. similarities between whole genome sequences of ACoV and HCoV-229E, a coronavirus first isolated around 1960, are evident. most Alphacoronaviruses, including AcoV, use aminopeptidase N of their natural host as a receptor. despite the host specificity of this receptor, all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline Aminopeptidase N. this would explain the ability to grow ACoV on feline origin cell lines, such as Crandell-feline kidney cells (CRFK) [31], and the failure to propagate virus on numerous other mamm viruses also show spike protein can influence tropism and pathogenesis of certain coronaviruses. it is interesting to note that the spike genes for the ACoV and HCoV-229E are more similar to each other than the nucleocapsid genes. the current ACoV genomic data provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between HCoV-229E and AcoV. it would be interesting to analyze South American HCoV-229E isolates that were obtained in different years to determine the genetic similarities to the ACoV."}
