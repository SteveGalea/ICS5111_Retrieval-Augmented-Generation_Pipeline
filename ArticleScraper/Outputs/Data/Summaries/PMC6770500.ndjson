{"summary": "this study aims to verify the genetic and antigenic variation of eight field IB strains regarding the 4/91 strain vaccination in Chilean chickens. all the viruses isolated prior to the 4/91 strain vaccination belong to the genetic group GI-16 (three isolates from 2009) the remaining four viruses belong to the group where the strain 4/91 has been previously classified. the 13885R-17 from 2017 challenge showed less tracheal virus replication for the 4/91 vaccine than for the 12101SP-09 from 2009 and 13347SP-15 from 2015 isolates. the results indicated genetic and antigenic diversity in the most recent infectious bronchitis virus isolates in Chile. IBV control is primarily through vaccines; however, the continuous appearance of new strains in different countries around the world necessitates assessment and upgrading of vaccination programs. a vaccinal strain that is not present in the country had been debated until this point. eight IBVs isolated from different outbreaks in commercial chicken flocks. the isolates 12101SP-09, 12101TR-09, 12124TR-09 were obtained in 2009. the samples were obtained through tracheal swabs from a 27- to 29-week-old broiler breeder. all the sampled flocks belong to the Chilean central zone. the complete zone also had several outbreaks in vaccinated poultry between 2008 and 2010. the nucleotide model substitution was then identified using Jmodeltest software v2.1.7 [25] and a maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using the online platform PhyML 3.0 [26]. serotype-specific antisera were prepared in chicks for field viruses 12101SP-09, 13347SP-15 and 13885R-17. the infectivity titer was calculated to determine the 50% chicken embryo infective dose (EID50) according to the Reed\u2013Muench method. values for the neutralizing index (NI) were estimated using the difference between the titers logged for the two strains. RT-qPCR for IBV Viral extraction was performed with a PureLinkTM Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, USA) a segment of 72 bp from N gene sequence was amplified using newly developed primers IBVN8-F (5\u2032-CCGAGACCAAAGTCACGCCC-3\u2032) and IBVN8-R (5\u2032-ACGCTGTTGGCGCT-3\u2032) the aqueous supernatant was tested for IBV using a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX) these eggs were used for virus isolation and incubated to obtain the one-day-old chicks for protection tests. tracheal swabs were obtained from a broiler breeder whose flock showed respiratory signs and a drop in egg production. the 13347SP-15 virus was isolated in 2015, four years after introduction of the 4/91 vaccine in Chilean productive systems. RT-PCR was performed using a PureLinkTM Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit. the full S1 segment (1600 bp) was amplified with the IBVS1-F (5\u2032-AACTCTGCACGCAAATTA-3\u2032) and IBVS1-R (5\u2032-TGTTGTCGCAAGGACC-3\u2032) primers. three isolates were selected considering the lineage and the isolation year. serotype-specific antisera were prepared in chicks for field viruses 12101SP-09, 13347SP-15 and 13885R-17. the viruses were inactivated with 0.1% v/v formalin at 37% for 12 h. sixty one-day-old chicks were immunized with the 4/91 vaccine by nasal instillation with 106 EID50/mL. at three weeks old, three of the four vaccinated groups were challenged with at least 107 EID50/mL of 12101SP-09, 13347SP-15 or 13885R-17 viruses by nasal instillation. standard curves were developed in triplicate with six ten-fold serial dilutions of purified amplicon beginning at 6.6175 101 ng/L through 6.6175 106 ng/L quantified in an Epoch2 spectrophotometer. the efficiency of the reaction was 1.05 while R and R2 reached values of 0.99. the melting curve analysis was conducted by raising 0.5 \u00b0C between 50 \u00b0C and 85 \u00b0C. MG545597 for 13691TR-17, MG545598 for 13698SP-17 and MG545600 for 13885R-17 were clustered together in the GI-16 lineage. the isolates 13885R-17, 13861R-17, 13691TR-17 and 13698SP-17 were clustered separately in the GI-13 lineage (Figure 1). isolates 13861R-17 and 13885R-17 could be verified along the whole S1 amino-acid sequence. a change in position 55 (counting from the start of the open reading frame of the S1 gene) from glycine to glutamic acid was identified. it is not presumed to be a vaccine re-isolation. the virus neutralization and protection test ELISA tests detected neutralizing antibodies in all chicks inoculated with the field viruses as well as the 4/91 and Mass vaccines. all the samples reached S/P values over the cut-off point provided by the kit manufacturer. criterion [30] was used to classify the antigenic relationships. minor changes in subtype were detected between virus 12101SP-09 and the mass and 4/91 vaccines. previous assays had shown that the efficiency of the Mass-4/91 protectotype justified introduction of this scarcely related vaccination. study shows changes in just one or two specific residues are enough to neutralize or not neutralize a specific strain. the control group did not show clinical signs, and the presence of the virus was not detected through RT-qPCR. the values ranged between 25 and 33.45 for the group challenged with the strain 12101SP-09, meanwhile between 26.32 and 32.13 from the chickens challenged with the virus 13347SP-15. there was no difference in the Ct values of the RT-qPCR performed from the groups of birds challenged with the three field viruses. virus 13885R-17 were significantly higher than the amount recovered from groups challenged with the 12101SP-09 and 13347SP-15 isolates. higher Ct of the RT-qPCR performed from birds challenged with the virus 13885R-17 shows that the samples had a lower initial viral amount. this is because of a more efficient inhibition of viral replication by the 4/91 vaccine. a remarkable similitude between the viruses isolated in 2017 and the 4/91 vaccine is observed. a change in position 55 (counting from the start of the open reading frame of the S1 gene) from glycine to glutamic acid was identified. the lack of virulence markers remains as a current issue. isolates were obtained from an outbreak in a commercial flock exhibiting clinical signs, they were not fortuitous isolations. the 13885R-17 and 13861R-17 isolates appear to be wild viruses derived from the 4/91 vaccine. three field viruses were chosen to develop the virus neutralization and protection test. the ELISA sample to positive (S/P ratio) was used to classify the antigenic relationships between the field strains and the mass and 4/91 vaccines. minor changes in subtype were detected between the virus 12101SP-09 and the mass and 4/91 vaccines. results align with those presented by Moore et al. [41] which showed that at least the amino acid 304 residue would be related to the neutralizing serotype-specific epitope. changes in just one or two specific residues are enough to neutralize or not neutralize a specific strain. the values ranged between 25 and 33.45 for the group challenged with the strain 12101SP-09. between 26.32 and 32.13 from the chickens challenged with the virus 13347SP-15, a higher range was registered from the group challenged with the virus 13885R-17. the Ct values showed a normal distribution (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test p-values of 0.5624) there was no difference in the Ct values of the RT-qPCR performed from the groups of birds challenged with strains 12101SP-09 and 13347SP-15 (p-value = 0.9252) the 23 different residues observed (Figure 2) were not enough to cluster apart the viruses from 2009 and 2015. despite the differences in biological behavior of the Chilean viruses and the Q1 strains isolated from China, the combination of the Mass and 4/91 vaccines provided good levels of protection against the GI-13 viruses isolated in Chile. the recently introduced 4/91 vaccine provides better protection against the strain isolated in 2017. if the challenge was with a heterologous strain, protection was generally variable and lower. however, it will be measured to elucidate the specific role of the avian immune system. there is no discussion of whether the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine was appropriate for controlling the clinical problems observed in the field. the reversal of virulence can be achieved in different and unpredictable ways facilitated by the high rates of mutation described for IBV. a whole-genome approach must be taken to clarify whether the proximity to the field strains from 2017 is due to vaccine reversion by mutation."}
