{"summary": "more than 100 iridovirus strains have been isolated. the entire genomes of 20 strains have been completely sequenced. the Iridoviridae family is composed of five genera. resistant membranes (DRMs) or caveolae are involved in virus internalization (6). these viruses include Ebola and Marburg viruses (9), measles virus (10, 11), rotavirus NSP4 (12), immunodeficiency virus (13\u201315), simian virus 40 (SV40) (16), influenza viruses (17), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (18). mouse monoclonal antibodies (Abs) raised against -actin, the Flag tag, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag, the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, the maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag, -tubulin, and the V5 tag were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. pcDNA3.1-MCP, pGEX-4T-MCP, and pCMV-myc-MCP were amplified by PCR using pCMV-myc-mCav-1 as the template. the PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then subcloned into the pCMV-myc vector. pCMV-myc-mCav-1, pCMV-myc-mCav-1, and pFlag-CMV4-mCav-1 were generated in a sequential three-step PCR using three pairs of primers. the first PCR amplification was performed with pCMV-myc-mCav-1 as the template, together with primer pairs primer-1/primer-5 and primer-4/primer-6. resulting PCR fragment the protein concentrations of the purified virus were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (BCA) the protein concentrations of the purified virus were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) the denatured product was resolved in triplicates on three 12% SDS-PAGE gels. the membrane was washed twice in TBST for 5 min each. another gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. the blots were blocked overnight in renaturing buffer. pCMV-myc-MCP and pFlag-CMV4 cells were lysed on ice with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.4 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors [Calbiochem]) the cells were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min HEK293T cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged mCav-1CSD. pcDNA-V5-MCP, myc\u2013mCav-1CSD and pcDNA-V5-MCP. lysates were immunoprecipitated by using rabbit anti-Myc and mouse anti-V5 antibodies. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-Myc-mCav-1. after 48 h, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. after 48 h, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. then resuspended in 500 l lysis buffer. cells were seeded onto 12-mm circular glass coverslips and prechilled to investigate colocalization of mCav-1 with MCP in ISKNV-infected cells. the cells were rinsed with PBS at 1 h postinfection and then replenished with fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS. the cells were then rinsed three times with 1 PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 1 PBS for 10 min. MFF-1 cells were infected with ISKNV to investigate the association of ISKNV with cholesterol-rich microdomains. each sucrose density gradient fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE. each sucrose density gradient fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed via immunoblotting. qPCR was carried out in three replicates per sample. the -actin gene was used as an endogenous reference to normalize the cell number variations in each sample. MFF-1 cells were infected with ISKNV at an MOI of 5 for 1 h or 4 h at 48 h after siRNA transfection. total RNA samples were extracted by using the RNeasy minikit. qPCR assays were carried out with a Roche LightCycler480 thermal cycler. cells were cultured as a monolayer at 37\u00b0C in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (Gibco) under a humidified atmosphere of air containing 5% CO2. rabbit polyclonal anti-MCP, anti-ORF101L, and mouse polyclonal anti-mCav-1 and mouse polyclonal antisera were previously generated in our laboratory. a DNA fragment of the ISKNV mcp gene was amplified by PCR. pcDNA 3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) was subcloned into the plasmid vectors pcDNA3.1-MCP, pGEX-4T-MCP, and pCMV-myc (Clontech/Ta myc\u2013mCav-1(139\u2013181) protein covers the mCav-1 sequence from aa 139 to 181. PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then subcloned into the pCMV-myc vector to generate pCMV-myc-mCav-1(aa 1\u2013104) and pCMV-myc-mCav-1(aa 139\u2013181) HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured overnight in 25-cm2 flasks at 5 106 cells prior to further treatment. each flask was inoculated with the virus suspension (multiplicity of infection] = 5) the cells were harvested at different times according to the experimental design. the membrane was washed twice in TBST for 5 min each. the membrane was then washed twice in TBST for 5 min each. the antigen-antibody complexes were then detected by using HRP-conjugated goat antigen-antibody complexes. ouse secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution) in TBST for 1 h. the cells were lysed on ice with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.4 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA. lysates were resuspended in 2 SDS loading buffer and then analyzed via SDS-PAGE. the protein lysates were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-Myc and mouse anti-V5 antibodies. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1 phosphate-buffered saline [pH 7.4], 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) the lysate was partially purified by centrifugation at 15,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. the resulting supernatant was used as the GST-MCP probe in a pulldown assay. lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with pCMV-Myc-MCP were incubated with immobilized MBP or MBP\u2013mCav-1. the cells were then incubated with ISKNV at an MOI of 5 at 4\u00b0C. the cells were rinsed with PBS at 1 h postinfection and then replenished with fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS. the coverslips were then rinsed three times with PBST for 10 min. the cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse secondary antibody. the coverslips were then washed several times with PBST. the transfected cells were bound with ISKNV on ice for 1 h. the cells were harvested or incubated for another 4 h. the effect of mCav-1 knockdown on ISKNV ORF101L protein expression was determined. fluorescence measurements were conducted at 70\u00b0C for 0.1 s during each cycle. qPCR was carried out in three replicates per sample. the -actin gene was used as an endogenous reference to normalize cell number variations in each sample. MCP-specific forward primer 5\u2032-CAATGTAGCACCCGCACTGACC-3\u2032 and MCP-specific reverse primer 5\u2032-ACCTCACGCTCCTCGCTTGTC-3\u2032 for the mcp gene. reaction volume and cycling parameters were the same as those described above. TCID50 assay was performed using the Reed-Muench method (30) proteins were visualized by Western blotting by applying a specific rabbit anti-MBP antibody onto one replicate of the PVDF membrane. in parallel, the other replicate PVDF membrane was incubated with MBP alone to determine whether these two proteins interacted with MBP alone. this showed that only the 30-kDa and not the 50-kDa protein bound to MBP alone. the antigen-antibody complexes were detected by using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution) in TBST for 2 h at RT and washed. the immobilized conjugates on the membrane were observed by using an HRP substrate solution. purified MBP\u2013mCav-1, but not MBP, interacted with Myc-MCP. expression of myc-MCP, MBP, and MBP\u2013mCav-1 proteins was also confirmed by Western blotting. agarose beads were washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2 SDS sample loading buffer. anti-Myc antibody was used as primary antibody to detect immunoprecipitation. mCav-1 interacted only with MCP (Fig. 2C, lane 1) and not with all controls. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-MCP (V5-MCP) combinations of recombinant plasmids. no band was detected when Myc\u2013mCav-1CSD and empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector were cotransfected. monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the mCav-1CSD binding partners. rabbit anti-V5 antibody was used to detect presence of MCP. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Myc\u2013mCav-1(1\u2013104) or Myc\u2013mCav-1(139\u2013181), each paired with V5-MCP. the proteins were either analyzed directly by using anti-V5 antibody via Western blotting. HEK293T cells were cotransfected by using the procedure mentioned above. the proteins were either analyzed directly by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (bottom) or subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. previous studies suggested that ISKNV internalizes into MFF-1 cells. at 1 h and 2 h p.i., MCP was detected mainly in the low-density mCav-1-enriched membrane fractions (lanes 5 and 6), indicating its association with the lipid raft. at 4 h p.i., the amount of MCP localizing in the denser fractions increased, but the amount of MCP in the low-density raft fractions decreased. the caveola-rich microdomains were purified via density gradient fractionation at 1 h (A), 2 h (B) and 4 h p.i. (C) the lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting. uninfected cells fractionated in parallel were used as controls (D) mCP colocalized with mCav-1 with time until 4 h p.i. no colocalization was observed with uninfected MFF-1 cells. mCP is associated with mCav-1 in the early stages of ISKNV infection of MFF-1 cells. all nuclei were stained with a blue fluorescent dye. bar = 10 m. disruption prevents caveola-mediated internalization of BK virus. however, we did not know if the disruption of mCav-1 affects the internalization of ISKNV into the cell. mCav-1 knockdown did not affect binding of ISKNV to cells at 1 h p.i. the cells were either not transfected (P) or transfected with 50 nM control siRNA (NC) or 50 nM mCav-1 siRNA 07. TCID50 of infected cells were determined at the indicated time points after infection. total DNA from virus-infected cells was extracted and subjected to qPCR for ISKNV mcp and -actin genes. levels of MCP DNA relative to those of -actin were determined. expression level of mCav-1 gene in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 was almost completely abolished. mCav-1 was well present in control cells either transfected with control siRNA or without siRNA (mock) no significant differences in mCav-1 expression were observed between the control cells without siRNA transfection (mock) and the cells transfected with control siRNA (mock) the amount of mcp genes (DNA) in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 was significantly lower than that in cells either transfected with control siRNA or without siRNA transfection at 1 h p.i. or 4 h p.i. these results suggest that the levels of invading ISKNV mcp genes (DNA) in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 were lower than those in cells either transfected with the expression level in MFF-1 cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 was significantly lower than that in cells either transfected with or transfected without control siRNA at 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h p.i. this is consistent with evidence at the protein level, obtained by Western blotting. inhibition of ISKNV internalization by knocking down mCav-1 resulted in reduced viral gene expression and virus production. the copy numbers of the mCav-1, mcp, and ORF001L genes were normalized to the copy number of -actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. the y axis represents the fold change in RNA levels relative to the control. the resulting PVDF membrane of two replicated samples was hybridized with MBP\u2013mCav-1 fusion proteins after renaturation (far-Western blotting) two specific proteins (50 kDa and 30 kDa) were visualized by subsequent Western blotting by applying a specific rabbit anti-MBP antibody onto one replicate of the PVDF membrane. this showed that only the 30-kDa and not the 50-kDa protein bound to MBP alone. the membrane was washed twice in TBST for 5 min. the blots were blocked overnight in renaturing buffer at 4\u00b0C. the antigen-antibody complexes were then detected by using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Myc-MCP and pFlag-CMV-mCav-1. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Myc-MCP. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Myc-MCP. the cells were lysed in 500 l radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer after 36 h. the cells were incubated with 2 g anti-Flag antibodies and 50 l protein A/G plus agarose beads at 4\u00b0C for 4 h. the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2 SDS sample loading buffer. pCMV-Myc-MCP was cotransfected with pFlag-CMV4. no band was detected when pCMV-Myc and pFlag-CMV4 were cotransfected. results showed that mCav-1 interacted only with MCP. mCav-1(139\u2013181) was associated with V5-MCP. no band was detected when Myc\u2013mCav-1CSD and empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His vectors were cotransfected. a reverse co-IP was performed to further confirm the interaction. mCav-1(aa 105 to 138) was a domain of mCav-1. hek293T cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged mCav-1(1\u2013104) or Myc\u2013mCav-1(139\u2013181) c\u2013mCav-1(139\u2013181), each paired with V5-MCP. the proteins were either analyzed directly by Western blotting. the cells were harvested at 36 h posttransfection, and the lysates were prepared. mCav-1 was enriched in low-density fractions 5 and 6 (caveola fraction) at 1 h p.i. and 2 h p.i., MCP was detected mainly in the low-density mCav-1-enriched membrane fractions (lanes 5 and 6), indicating its association with the lipid raft. MCP was localized in the caveolae in the early stages of ISKNV infection. the cells were lysed with cold 1% Triton X-100 (1 PBS) the caveola-rich microdomains were purified via density gradient fractionation. the frequency of colocalization of MCP with mCav-1 markedly increased when ISKNV-bound cells were incubated for 1 h at 27\u00b0C for 0 h (B), 1 h (C), 2 h (D), and 4 h (E) no colocalization was observed with uninfected MFF-1 cells. cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-mCav-1 and anti-MCP antibodies. all nuclei were stained with a blue fluorescent dye. disruption prevents caveola-mediated internalization of BK virus. total cellular proteins were then extracted from infected cells. mCav-1 expression level was significantly lower in cells with mCav-1 siRNA 07. mCav-1 knockdown did not affect binding of ISKNV to cells at 1 h p.i. transfected MFF-1 cells were infected with ISKNV for 1 h and 4 h. cells were infected with ISKNV for 1 h and 4 h at 27\u00b0C. TCID50 of infected cells were determined at the indicated time points after infection. mCav-1 expression in the cells transfected with 50 nM mCav-1 siRNA 07 was almost completely abolished. mCav-1 was well present in control cells either transfected with control siRNA or transfected without siRNA (mock) no significant differences in mCav-1 expression were observed between the control cells without siRNA transfection (mock) and the cells transfected without siRNA (mock) expression level of mCav-1 gene in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 was significantly lower than that of cells either transfected with control siRNA or without siRNA transfection at 1 h p.i. or 4 h p.i. the amount of mcp genes (DNA) in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07 was significantly lower than those in cells either transfected with control siRNA or without siRNA at 1 h expression levels of the mCav-1, ISKNV ORF001L and mcp genes were significantly lower in cells transfected with mCav-1 siRNA 07. this is consistent with evidence at the protein level, obtained by Western blotting. inhibition of ISKNV internalization by knocking down mCav-1 resulted in reduced viral gene expression and virus production. data obtained are given as means SD from three independent experiments. qRT-PCR assay for mCav-1 (B), MCP (C), ISKNV ORF001L (D) and -actin mRNAs was performed by using total RNA extracted from the harvested cells. gene knockdown significantly inhibited the internalization of ISKNV. mCav-1 may play an important role in the early stages of ISKNV infection. research on virus-host protein interactions can help us understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity and virus-induced immunological responses. research on the uptake of tiger frog virus (TFV) into mammalian cells showed a pH-dependent atypical caveola-dependent endocytosis (50) the results of siRNA assays suggested that in association with mCav-1, ISKNV is directed into cells via a caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway. binding motifs include the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 of HIV (57, 58), the heterotrimeric G protein, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (59), and various receptor tyrosine kinases (7, 60). we hypothesize that ISKNV structure proteins (4) with Cav-1-binding motifs may interact with mCav-1. sterol carrier protein 2, which lacks a consensus Cav-1-binding domain, binds with Cav-1 at the N-terminal domain between aa 34 and 40 (61, 62). further studies are needed to determine the exact amino acid sequences of mCav-1 that are responsible for the interaction. SV40 can enter cells devoid of caveolae through an alternative tyrosine kinase- and cholesterol-dependent endocytic pathway (68) mCav-1 knockdown remarkably inhibited ISKNV infection, suggesting that caveola endocytosis might be the only way of ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells. mCP was associated with caveolae in the early stages of viral infection. uncoated viral particles translocate to the host cell nucleus. mCav-1 in viral replication, uncoating, or early transcription in the process of uncoating parallels with viral entry."}
