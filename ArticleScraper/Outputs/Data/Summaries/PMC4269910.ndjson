{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that was first cloned in 1989 and classified as a member of the family Flaviviridae. it is estimated that about 1012 virions per day are produced in a given individual[2]. there are 6 characterized genotypes of HCV, 52 subtypes within these genotypes. the current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is a combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin. the current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is a combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin. the number of infected individuals will continue to increase in the absence of effective care and treatment programs. NAT NAT detect and quantify HCV RNA and are now considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of HCV infection. NAT offers accurate and sensitive diagnosis without any additional confirmatory test and can be used to diagnose individuals with acute HCV infection. NAT play a crucial role in the management of antiviral therapies by monitoring HCV RNA level. the competition between the commercial products enforces the companies to produce more simple, easy to use and cheap assays. the significant advances in HCV diagnosis include using point-of-care alternatives instead of the routine venous puncture. isothermal amplification techniques are simple, rapid and cost effective with equivalent specificity and sensitivity to PCR, enabling point-of-care diagnostics without the need to high costing equipment[31,32]. however, isothermal amplification approaches differed from each other in terms of operating temperature, reaction duration, mechanism, strengths and weaknesses. RCA will be kicked out of the race because it is incompatible with point-of-care diagnosis. complex primer designing and the inability to perform multiplex amplification eliminates LAMP. the need to a denaturation step and the inability to tolerate inhibitory biological components exit both NABSA and SDA. strand extension takes place at the free 3\u2019-end of the nucleoprotein filaments by a strand displacing DNA polymerase to synthesize a new complementary strand. the new synthesized strand displaces the originally paired strand. real-time detection of RPA amplicons is possible via specific probes. assay showed rapid kinetics with equal sensitivity and specificity of real-time RT-PCR. authors found analytical sensitivity and specificity equal to PCR with no cross-detection among targets. phylococcus aureus concluded that the kinetic performance of RPA was faster than PCR with no loss in sensitivity and specificity. amplification reaction was conducted under a broad range of conditions from 30 \u00b0C-45 \u00b0C with high inhibitory concentration of known PCR inhibitors in just 15 min[44]. the concept of SAMRS was introduced over a decade ago[48,49] and was exploited to fix interactions between primers in PCR and multiplex PCR[50] NAT represent the gold standard for the diagnosis of HCV infection."}
