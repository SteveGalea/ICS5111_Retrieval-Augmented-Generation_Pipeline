{"summary": "Phytoplankton are the drivers of the \u2018biologic pump\u2019 where carbon dioxide is assimilated by photosynthesis to organic C, recycled in the top layer of the oceans or, ultimately, deposited on the ocean floor. viral infections leading to cell lysis are estimated to induce the turnover of > 25% of the phytoplankton biomass, thus having a huge impact on ocean biogeochemical cycles. EhVs are large (c. 180 nm), have icosahedral symmetry, and are included in the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) clade. of major interest are genes encoding for an almost complete biosynthetic pathway for the production of sphingolipids that play a key role in the chemical arms race during this host\u2013virus interaction. autophagy can also serve as an antiviral host defense mechanism. many RNA viruses use the autophagic membrane as a scaffold for RNA replication. autophagy can also serve as an antiviral host defense mechanism. autophagy can induce a switch between stress acclimation and initiation of a cell death biochemical cascade following stress of eukaryotic cells. this switch can act as a proviral or antiviral strategy in plants. in plants, autophagy plays a critical role in the hypersensitive response to pathogens. all experiments were performed with exponential phase cultures (5 105\u2013106 cells ml1) the virus used for this study is the lytic Emiliania huxleyi virus EhV201. 1 ml of cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 g, 3 min, 4\u00b0C) the extract was diluted 100 in water and 1 l was used for qPCR analysis with the mcp primers as described earlier. all reactions were carried out in duplicate. the cells were then washed in ASW and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium dichromate and 0.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate in ASW for 1 h. samples were infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Epon EMBED 812 (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA) virions were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in ASW for 2\u20133 h. they were then washed three times using a 50 kDa Amicon filter. an equal volume of 10% gelatin was added and the samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and transferred to ice for 30 min. 106 cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 3 min and resuspended in 100 l Lysosensor Green DND-189 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) or MDC (Sigma Aldrich) after 10 (Lysosensor) or 30 (MDC) min of dark incubation, the cells were washed twice in FSW. Flow cytometry was performed on an Eclipse (iCyt) flow cytometer. an equal number of VLPs was taken for each treatment to a plaque assay. one hundred microliters of virus at a concentration of 104 VLPs ml1 were added to the cells. samples were centrifuged (500 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C) to remove cell debris. the supernatant was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the membrane pellet fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% deoxycholate. anti-Atg8 and the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit antibody were diluted 1:4000 and 1:10 000, respectively, in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk powder. the antibody cannot distinguish between the E. huxleyi Atg8a and Atg8b protein sequences. atg5, atg7 and vps34 sequences were submitted to GenBank Third Party Annotation (TPA), under accession nos. BK008763, BK008764 and BK008762 respectively. all experiments were performed with exponential phase cultures (5 105\u2013106 cells ml1) the virus used for this study is the lytic Emiliania huxleyi virus EhV201. the extract was diluted 100 in water and 1 l was used for qPCR analysis with the mcp primers as described earlier. the results were calibrated against serial dilutions of EhV201 DNA at known concentrations. samples were fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium dichromate and 0.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate for 1 h, at room temperature, stained again and stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. samples were infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Epon EMBED 812 (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized at 60\u00b0C. virions embedded in the gelatin were cryoprotected by infiltration with 2.3 M sucrose for 24 h at room temperature and frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. images were acquired using an FEI Tecnai T12 TEM operating at 120 kV. 106 cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 3 min and resuspended in 100 l Lysosensor Green DND-189 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) or MDC (Sigma Aldrich) after 10 (Lysosensor) or 30 (MDC) min of dark incubation, the cells were washed twice in FSW. Flow cytometry was performed on an Eclipse (iCyt) flow cytometer, with a 488 nm excitation laser and 525 nm emission to yield viral-like particle (VLP) counts. an equal number of VLPs was taken for each treatment to a plaque assay according to Schroeder et al. (2002). the supernatant was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the membrane pellet fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% deoxycholate. samples were then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 2 h to separate soluble from insoluble proteins. the antirabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 1:4000 and 1:10 000. the antibody cannot distinguish between the E. huxleyi Atg8a and Atg8b protein sequences. RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from 250 ml cultures. atg5, atg7 and vps34 sequences were submitted to GenBank Third Party Annotation (TPA), under accession nos. BK008763, BK008764 and BK008762 respectively. atg5, atg7 and vps34 sequences were corrected based on expressed sequence tags. transmission electron microscopy of infected cells revealed compromised cells within 24 h of infection. degradation of nuclear material is apparent, as well as shrinkage of the chloroplast. in almost all the observed infected cells, we detected DMVs. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of a chemically fixed virion, the DNA is observed as the electron-dense material in the center of the virion. a larger version of (c\u2013e) can be found in Fig. S5. codnaviridae, PBCV1 and EsV1 contain membranes internal to the capsid. the observed DMVs suggest the occurrence of membrane redistribution during infection, which may provide a source for the massive requirement of viral membranes. 90% of the cells within the infected population were positively stained. at 30 hpi, there was a significant elevation in extracellular viral abundance (P 0.05) this raises the possibility that acidic lysosomal pH may delay viral release at the earlier stages of infection. this suggests that the EhV particles do not encounter the lysosome during regular infection, and may even block the fusion between the double-membrane autophagosome and the lysosome. phagy-related genes in cultures infected with the lytic EhV201. results are normalized to tubulin and to the uninfected control. data are presented as log2 fold change. we used RT-PCR analysis to quantify relative transcription profile of key components of all stages of the autophagy process. atg8a was induced by 24 hpi and reduced back to its basal level towards the end of lytic infection. Conversely, atg8b is probably present during infection. treatment with phospholipase D (PLD) shifted the proteins back to their nonlipidated form, detected by the slower migration of the protein in the 6 M urea gel. we further analyzed the transcript abundance of vps34, which is involved in the autophagy activation phase. we identified a homolog of vps34 in E. huxleyi, and showed that it is up-regulated during viral infection. wortmannin-treated infected cells observed swollen endosome-like structures that accumulated viruses within them. the autophagy-like process was not inhibited in the control cells or nontreated infected cells. wortmannin has been shown to induce swelling of endocytic vacuoles in mammalian cells. extracellular viruses from the wortmannin-treated and nontreated cultures had infectivity values of 24.2 5.4 and 26.2 5.6 plaque-forming units per viral particle. this indicates that the inhibition of autophagy was not enough to completely inhibit production of infective virions. wortmannin blocks accumulation of Atg8 during infection, supporting its role in inhibition of the autophagy-like process in infected cells. this is the first demonstration of incorporation of cellular autophagy components into viral structures. we could not detect Atg8-PE in isolated virions that were released from cells infected in the presence of wortmannin. Vaccinia virus, also a member of the NCLDV clade, contains large amounts of PE in the virion. it induced lipidation of the mammalian homolog of Atg8 (LC3) by an Atg5/Atg7 independent process. the interplay between autophagy and cell death is well documented in mammalian systems. Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV) is a large virus that possesses at least two internal membranes. the majority of which are viral-specific sphingolipids encoded for by the viral unique genome. we suggest that during the host\u2013virus arms race, the virus subverts the cellular autophagic-like process for its benefit. transmission electron microscopy of infected cells revealed compromised cells within 24 h of infection. degradation of nuclear material is apparent, as well as shrinkage of the chloroplast. in almost all the observed cells, we detected DMVs. quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers for the mcp gene (for a and b, n = 3; results presented are average SD) TEM analysis of a representative micrograph of E. huxleyi control cells showed higher magnification of the boxed areas, depicting the DMVs. phycodnaviridae, PBCV1 and EsV1 contain membranes internal to the capsid. infected cells exhibit hallmarks of an autophagic-like cellular process. by 24 hpi, 90% of cells within the infected population were positively stained. at 30 hpi, there was a significant elevation in extracellular viral abundance (P 0.05), which raises the possibility that acidic lysosomal pH may delay viral release at the earlier stages of infection. however, we could not detect any viral particles within lysosomes by TEM analysis of infected cells, at any stage of infection. this suggests that the EhV particles do not encounter the lysosome during regular infection. homologs of core autophagy-related genes in cultures infected with lytic EhV201. results normalized to tubulin and to the uninfected control at same time point. we used RT-PCR analysis to quantify relative transcription profile of key components of all stages of the autophagy process. atg8a was induced by 24 hpi and reduced back to its basal level towards the end of lytic infection. Conversely, atg8b was not induced upon infection, but is probably present during infection. treatment with phospholipase D (PLD) shifted the proteins back to their nonlipidated form, detected by the slower migration of the protein in the 6 M urea gel. we further analyzed the transcript abundance of vps34, which is involved in the autophagy activation phase. we identified a homolog of vps34 in E. huxleyi, and showed that it is up-regulated during viral infection. reduction in viral release by inhibiting the autophagy-like process was not the result of reduced viral DNA replication. wortmannin-treated infected cells showed swollen endosome-like structures that accumulated viruses within them. wortmannin has been shown to induce swelling of endocytic vacuoles in mammalian cells. extracellular viruses from the wortmannin-treated and nontreated cultures had infectivity values of 24.2 5.4 and 26.2 5.6 plaque-forming units per viral particle. this indicates that the inhibition of autophagy was not enough to completely inhibit production of infective virions. western blot analysis of the Atg8 protein during infection revealed that the lipidated Atg8-PE is the predominant form in cells during infection. these data show that the membranes originating from the autophagic-like process within the infected cells are incorporated into the newly formed viral structures before egress from the cells. this is the first demonstration of incorporation of cellular autophagy components into viral structures. Vaccinia virus, also a member of the NCLDV clade, contains large amounts of PE in the virion. at least a fraction of its membranes originate from an Atg8-PE-containing membrane, most likely the autophagosome. the interplay between autophagy and cell death is well documented in mammalian systems. Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV) is a large virus that possesses at least two internal membranes. the majority of which are viral-specific sphingolipids encoded for by the viral unique genome. we suggest that during the host\u2013virus arms race, the virus subverts the cellular autophagic-like process for its benefit.
