{"summary": "in 2011, 83% of the world's children received all three doses of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine primary series. routine immunizations save the lives of approximately 2.5 million children per year. the world has committed to the common vision of a Decade of Vaccines. global immunization efforts in developing countries are broadly supported by most people in the united states. but support of global immunizations is not limited to humanitarian aid. recent threats from infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza or importations of VPDs such as measles highlight the fact that U.S. health is intricately linked to global health. the NVAC recommendations focus on six areas where HHS efforts should be further leveraged to achieve the greatest contributions to reducing health burdens through global immunization efforts. the NVAC recommendations focus on six areas where HHS efforts should be further leveraged to achieve the greatest contributions to reducing health burdens through global immunization efforts. the ASH should lead efforts to coordinate briefings, public events, and educational outreach to policy makers, legislators, and the general public. the ASH should emphasize that political and public support is fundamental to achieving polio eradication and advancing global goals for measles mortality reduction and regional goals for measles/rubella elimination. STOP Team assignments should focus on building broad subject-matter expertise that can be applied to polio and measles efforts. the ASH should work with CDC to create opportunities to bring together stakeholders and leadership from the global Polio Eradication Initiative and the measles Rubella Initiative. the ASH should support the work of CDC and its partners within the international community to define standards for measuring the impact of routine delivery strategies such as the Reaching Every District/Community strategy. the ASH should endorse and facilitate HHS coordination with other USG agencies to support efforts that provide routine overseas administration and documentation of vaccinations for all U.S.-bound refugees. countries will need support to monitor, identify, and respond to vaccine safety concerns and adverse events following immunizations. the ASH should identify mechanisms to encourage ongoing collaboration between HHS agencies involved in post-licensure vaccine safety and related global agencies. partnerships create opportunities to train the next generation of scientists to better address current and future global health needs. the ASH should encourage HHS agencies to work closely with USAID, WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, end users, including national immunization program managers. the ASH should support efforts to strengthen national regulatory authorities in other countries through collaboration with the FDA. national vaccine programs, combined with currently recommended vaccines, has the potential to save 23 million lives by 2020. decision makers must have the capability to evaluate the available data to support the introduction of new vaccines into national immunization programs. the ASH should continue to support the development of quality baseline data and ongoing collection of key data. the ASH should work with the HHS Secretary, the HHS Office of Global Affairs, and HHS operating divisions to define a process to strengthen coordination of HHS-led global immunization efforts. Enhanced coordination would ensure alignment of priorities, minimize duplication of global immunization efforts, and facilitate discussing and addressing challenges and barriers on an ongoing basis. 6.2.1. the ASH should consider convening an HHS cross-departmental working group to create an HHS Global Immunizations Implementation Plan the ASH should lead efforts to coordinate briefings, public events, and educational outreach to policy makers, legislators, and the general public. the ASH should also communicate that global vaccination efforts save lives in other countries, but they also enhance our own domestic health security. failure to complete polio eradication goals or advance goals for measles mortality reduction and regional goals for measles/rubella elimination may threaten the health of U.S. populations due to importations of these diseases from endemic areas. achieving these goals would equal a monumental public health and humanitarian accomplishment for the entire global community. CDC should work to capture and review these findings to inform current programming, the introduction of new vaccines, and other global public health efforts. prioritizing efforts to strengthen global immunization systems will build long-term capacity for routine immunization systems. the ASH should advocate for HHS efforts that support the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the GAVI Alliance (GAVI) and multilateral organizations. the ASH should support the work of HHS and its partners within the international community to define standards for measuring the impact of routine delivery strategies. the ASH should endorse and facilitate HHS coordination with other USG agencies to support efforts that provide routine overseas administration and documentation of vaccinations for all U.S.-bound refugees with vaccines identified for pre-departure administration. the ASH should identify mechanisms to encourage ongoing collaborations and technical support between HHS agencies involved in post-licensure vaccine safety. the ASH should identify mechanisms to encourage ongoing collaborations and technical support between HHS agencies involved in post-licensure vaccine safety and related global agencies. the ASH should support efforts to strengthen national regulatory authorities in other countries through collaboration with the FDA. the ASH should support efforts to strengthen national regulatory authorities in other countries through collaboration with the FDA. the ASH should continue to support the development of quality baseline data and ongoing collection of key data. the ASH should work with HHS offices and non-HHS partners to increase investments in national evidence-based decision making by NITAGs. support should include technical assistance and provisions to develop and train these NITAG bodies. Enhanced coordination would ensure alignment of priorities, minimize duplication of global immunization efforts, and facilitate discussing and addressing challenges and barriers. 6.2.2. this HHS cross-departmental working group should also determine a mechanism to enhance HHS coordination with USG agencies (e.g., USAID and doD) the NVAC believes HHS has a vital role to play in the global efforts to make the Decade of Vaccines vision a reality. the recommendations and supporting rationale are intended to raise awareness of ongoing HHS efforts in context of global initiatives. the continued participation of HHS in the six priority areas identified by NVAC will make certain that global immunization remains at the forefront of HHS global health priorities.

NVAC's findings outline a number of global initiatives and global efforts toward improving the prevention and control of important infectious diseases through immunizations. this report is not intended to represent an exhaustive catalog of global immunization activities; rather, highlights those activities that could be further strengthened through enhanced HHS efforts. global campaigns against measles contributed to an 18% reduction in overall childhood mortality. this accomplishment is predicted to have averted a cumulative 12.7 million deaths. accelerated measles control efforts led to an 80% reduction in measles-related deaths from 1990 to 2010 (125,000 deaths) models predict 23 million future deaths could be averted during the next decade (2011\u20132020) if high global coverage can be achieved for both routine and new/underutilized vaccines, underscoring the remarkable impact that improved, equitable access to immunizations could have on reducing mortality. every dollar spent during this time period on childhood immunizations in the U.S. resulted in savings of $10 billion in direct costs and $43 billion in societal costs. the economic impact of investments to reduce the mortality caused by VPDs is also significant. the ultimate expression of vaccination is the complete eradication of a VPD. when achievable, eradication has proven to have significant cost benefits. others estimate that the incremental global net benefits of the global Polio Eradication Initiative are approximately $40\u2013$50 billion. global immunization efforts are mutually beneficial for the U.S. population as well as the global community. this outbreak was the highest number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in 15 years. the global immunization enterprise comprises a wide range of stakeholders, including developing and donor countries, multilateral organizations, development agencies, philanthropic organizations, academia, vaccine manufacturers, civil societies, health-care workers, advocacy groups. global collaborations and public-private partnerships focused on either specific pathogen-driven initiatives or broader immunization-related issues are critical to garnering the political support. a global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) was developed by the Decade of Vaccines leadership2. it builds on the GIVS by evaluating the lessons learned from GIVS implementation. the GVAP provides a roadmap for bringing the full benefits of immunizations to all people by 2020. GAVI was formed in 2000 as a mechanism to address resource constraints for vaccine financing. mission is to save children's lives and improve people's health by increasing access to immunization in poor countries. middle-income countries and those that do not qualify for GAVI support still face financial barriers to introducing new vaccines as they become available. most people in the u.S. support maintaining or increasing U.S. funding for global immunization programs and global health. the role of HHS The USG is committed to creating a safer and healthier world by reducing the global burden of VPDs. a number of agencies including HHS, USAID, doD, and the state department provide specific support for these objectives through pro-vaccination policies, programmatic activities, collaborations, and financial assistance. NVPO and the Office of Global Affairs demonstrate core competencies that will be necessary to realize the full benefits of the Decade of Vaccines. these activities include expanding scientific research capacity, forwarding innovations in vaccine development, manufacturing and licensure, optimizing disease control efforts, building public demand for vaccines. the NVAC formed a global immunoization Working Group consisting of experts in issues relevant to all aspects of the global immunization efforts to address these charges. in 2011, 83% of children worldwide were fully vaccinated with three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. 84% were vaccinated with at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine. this amazing accomplishment is predicted to have averted a cumulative 12.7 million deaths. progress toward the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) goal of 90% coverage for the third dose of DTP and single dose of measles-containing vaccines is suboptimal, particularly among priority countries. it is estimated that 22.4 million children annually are still not being fully immunized with three doses of DTP according to recommendations. dMeasles SIAs include catch-up (aged 9 months to 14 years) and follow-up (aged 9 months to 10 years) campaigns. the number of congenital rubella syndrome deaths averted were calculated for only the 50 countries projected to introduce rubella vaccine with GAVI Alliance support. the lifetime costs of caring for a severely disabled survivor of the 1964 U.S. rubella epidemic are estimated at $159,530 per year. the cost to fully vaccinate a child in a developing country with two doses of the measles-rubella combination vaccine (MR) is approximately $1.00. the ultimate expression of vaccination is the complete eradication of a VPD. eradication is not always technically feasible or cost-effective for all VPDs. however, when achievable, eradication has proven to have significant cost benefits. this outbreak was the highest number of measles cases reported in the u.s. in 15 years. 18 cases occurred in children who were too young to be vaccinated. the remaining cases were due to presumed importations. the GIVS emphasizes making immunization programs a national priority. the GIVS emphasizes making immunization programs a national priority. the GVAP builds on the GIVS by evaluating the lessons learned from first few years of GIVS implementation. immunizations, integration of immunizations into health systems, financial sustainability, and innovation can weaken routine immunization systems. poor program management can create difficulties in monitoring and evaluating programs, thereby complicating planning efforts. some countries may need additional technical and financial support to accommodate additional vaccines into their immunization programs. financial support is based on a sliding scale, and countries are expected to bear increasing shares of the vaccine costs as their GNI per capita increases. countries must submit a costed, comprehensive, multiyear plan for immunization to ensure their programs are sustainable. in the 10-year period spanning 2001\u20132011, the U.S. financial contributions to GAVI totaled $736 million, made through USAID, exclusively for vaccine procurement. in recent years, the U.S. has shown a strong commitment to global health initiatives, including disease-specific goals such as worldwide polio eradication. the 2010 NVP, put forth by the HHS National Vaccine Program Office, outlines a 10-year strategic vision for coordinating national immunization efforts both within and outside of the federal government. the NVPO highlights \"supporting the global introduction and availability of new and underutilized vaccines to prevent diseases of public health importance\" NVAC RECOMMENDATION 1: TACKLING TIME-LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE POLIO ERADICATION AND TO ADVANCE MEASLES MORTALITY REDUCTION AND REGIONAL MEASLES/RUBELLA ELIMINATION GOALS NVAC recommendation 1.1: completing global goals for polio eradication and advancing global measles mortality reduction goals. global immunization initiatives, including polio eradication, were declared one of CDC's 10 \u201cwinnable battles\u201d in 2010. in 2010, global immunization initiatives, including polio eradication, were declared one of CDC's 10 \u201cwinnable battles\u201d as a way to spotlight the issues. in the 1980s, an estimated 350,000 cases of paralytic polio occurred annually in 125 endemic countries around the world. more than 200,000 of these cases occurred in India, translating to approximately one case every three minutes. by 2002, the efforts of the GPEI had reduced the global incidence of polio worldwide by 99%. in 2010, an imported case of wild polio virus (WPV) from India led to 458 cases of laboratory-confirmed polio in Tajikistan. the outbreak resulted in 476 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. in total, the outbreak resulted in 476 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. polio cases have dropped from 1,352 cases in 2010 to 223 cases in 201279. the GPEI estimates that it has administered more than 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine to 2.5 billion children worldwide, preventing more than 10 million cases of paralytic polio. CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on December 2, 2011 to respond to polio eradication as a global public health emergency. this activation has allowed CDC to scale up partnership efforts, including expanding technical assistance for vaccination and surveillance activities. more than 400 CDC personnel have contributed to the analysis, validation, and exchange of critical information to increase the program's situational awareness. the Endgame Strategy includes a comprehensive cost analysis for completing the objectives within the strategy. the responsible parties for ensuring oversight of goals and activities, a description of possible risks to completing goals and milestones. major milestones outlined in the Endgame Strategy include stopping all WPV transmission by the end of 2014 and stopping new outbreaks of cVDPV outbreaks within 120 days of an index case. the endgame Strategy outlines a parallel approach to eradicate WPV. it asks countries to include administration of at least one dose of IPV into their routine immunization programs by 2015. however, the use of IPV-containing vaccines is considered cost-prohibitive for many countries. more than 450 scientific and technical experts from more than 80 countries signed a scientific declaration on polio eradication. the scientific declaration endorses the Endgame Strategy and urges all stakeholders to commit the financial and programmatic efforts required to complete the goals outlined in the Endgame Strategy. one of the greatest obstacles to completion of the polio eradication goals is insufficient funding to conduct immunization campaigns and program activities. polio immunizations are those given solely as part of routine systems with no additional funding for SIAs, outbreak response, or active surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis. the polio immunizations are those given solely as part of routine systems with no additional funding for SIAs, outbreak response, or active surveillance. accelerated measles control efforts have led to a decrease in measles-related deaths by 71% from 2000 to 2011. accelerated measles control efforts have led to a decrease in measles-related deaths by 71% from 2000 to 2011. the MRI released an eight-year (2012\u20132020) global measles and rubella strategic plan that focuses support on 67 priority countries based on the level of their vaccination coverage for measles. globally measles vaccine coverage has increased from 16% in 1980 to 84% in 2011, regions in Africa and Southeast Asia continue to report 79% coverage. concerted global efforts will need to enhance communication strategies regarding misconceptions about vaccines, concerns regarding vaccine safety, skepticism regarding the benefits of vaccination, and religious objections to vaccination. NVAC recommendation 1.2: sustaining efforts for polio eradication and measles mortality reduction. CDC includes global immunization activities as a line item in its annual appropriations request to Congress. majority of this funding is allocated to activities that support polio eradication and the control of measles and other VPDs within the global context. NVAC recommendations 1.3 and 1.4: enhancing CDC technical assistance for reaching polio eradication and measles mortality reduction goals. the ASH should encourage CDC to continue to enhance the public health impact of its Stop Transmission of Polio (STOP) program by increasing the number and length of training opportunities. CDC and WHO provide renowned expertise in virologic surveillance, virus characterization, quality control, and serological and specimen testing. the CDC Measles/Rubella Laboratory facilitates measles and rubella outbreak control efforts at the national, regional, and global levels to investigate and contain the spread of measles and rubella infections. STOP Team members have provided the equivalent of 262 person-years of support to countries at the national and subnational level. the ASH should lead efforts to coordinate briefings, public events, and educational outreach to policy makers, legislators, and the general public. polio eradication and measles mortality reduction and regional elimination efforts should complement and strengthen routine immunization systems. failure to complete polio eradication goals or to advance goals for measles/rubella elimination may threaten the health of U.S. populations due to importations of these diseases from endemic areas. measures of success for the Decade of Vaccines initiative will include certification of global polio eradication and measles/rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by 2020. despite the impressive progress that has been made, the headway gained during the past three decades toward polio eradication and measles mortality reduction are fragile. from 2001 to 2011, the reduction in polio cases plateaued.65,66 Barriers in the remaining endemic countries, including weak immunization programs, poor management and accountability, misconceptions about vaccine safety, political turmoil, and conflict. this disruption led to exportation of polio cases from endemic countries into polio-free countries. the spread of polioviruses and the reestablishment of polio transmission in countries that had been deemed polio-free serve as a cautionary tale for what can happen when polio is not eradicated from all countries. the risk of exportation of polioviruses from endemic countries has elicited calls for substantially enhancing current efforts. cVDPVs can also threaten polio-free communities where lower vaccination coverage is no longer at levels high enough to ensure herd immunity. experts now support administration of at least one dose of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and the transition from the use of trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (poliovirus types 1 and 3) to mitigate the risk of continued cVDPV type 2 circulation. the GPEI introduced the 2013\u20132018 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategy. it advocates strong, reliable routine immunization systems will be central to the GPEI's success. the Endgame Strategy includes a comprehensive cost analysis for completing the objectives within the strategy. OPV2 = wild polio virus type2-containing oral polio vaccine bOPV = bivalent oral polio vaccine cVDPV = inactivated polio vaccine cVDPV = oral polio vaccine The Endgame Strategy outlines a parallel approach to eradicate WPV while simultaneously pursuing strategies to eliminate all cases of cVDPV. however, the use of IPV-containing vaccines is considered cost-prohibitive for many countries. polio-endemic countries and other countries at increased risk of reintroduction correlate with regions that persistently report high numbers of un- and under-vaccinated children. polio-endemic countries and other countries at increased risk of reintroduction correlate with regions that persistently report high numbers of un- and under-vaccinated children. the budget needed to achieve the objectives of the GPEI Eradication and Endgame Strategy (2013\u20132018), a by funding category aGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative. the majority of the projected budget is dedicated to immunization activities, both OPV campaigns, and incorporating IPV into routine immunization systems. in 2000, the number of reported measles cases worldwide was estimated to be greater than 850,000. in 2000, the number of reported measles cases worldwide was estimated to be greater than 850,000. an estimated 542,000 deaths were reported for that year, 11 ranking measles the 19th leading cause of death worldwide. the measles/Rubella Initiative (MRI) is now called the Measles/Rubella Initiative. the initiative's strategy incorporates goals for achieving and maintaining the elimination of both measles and rubella. all six WHO regions had committed to regional measles elimination goals by 2020. 103 Decreasing support for global immunization programs could jeopardize momentum gained from the accomplishments of the measles efforts. in 2009, africa reported a drastic resurgence of >200,000 measles cases and >1,400 deaths in 28 sub-Saharan countries. in 2011, more than 30,000 measles cases and seven deaths were reported from 29 countries in Europe. by 2002, the efforts of the GPEI had reduced the global incidence of polio worldwide by 99%. from 2001 to 2011, the reduction in polio cases plateaued.65,66 Barriers in the remaining endemic countries\u2014including weak immunization programs, poor management and accountability. more than 1,500 children were left paralyzed, and outbreak response efforts cost the global community more than U.S. $500 million. the risk of exportation of polioviruses from endemic countries has elicited calls for substantially enhancing current efforts. more than 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to 2.5 billion children worldwide, preventing more than 10 million cases of paralytic polio. countries will need to maintain high-quality surveillance efforts for the rapid detection and investigation of all acute onset flaccid paralysis cases. environmental sampling and virologic characterization of stool samples will be important for detecting ongoing silent transmission of polioviruses in communities. the GPEI introduced the 2013\u20132018 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategy. it advocates strong, reliable routine immunization systems will be central to the GPEI's success. the endgame Strategy includes a comprehensive cost analysis for completing the objectives within the strategy. in the Endgame Strategy include (1) stopping all WPV transmission by the end of 2014 and stopping new outbreaks of cVDPV outbreaks within 120 days of an index case. (2) achieving at least a 10% year-on-year increase in DTP3 coverage in the worst performing districts in focus countries from 2014 to demonstrate routine immunization activities. investment in R&D efforts will continue to be essential for developing new tools to help the global community complete polio eradication and ensure ongoing protection against accidental or intentional reintroduction of the virus. polio-endemic countries and other countries at increased risk of reintroduction correlate with regions that persistently report high numbers of un- and under-vaccinated children. the 2013\u20132018 Endgame Strategy will require a total budget of $5.5 billion, with costs peaking at $1 billion in 2013 and declining annually to U.S. $760 million in 2018. currently, the GPEI faces a 2013\u20132018 budget shortfall of $2 billion necessary for continuing critical SIAs and efforts to strengthen existing vaccination programs. in 2000, the number of reported measles cases worldwide was estimated to be greater than 850,000. an estimated 542,000 deaths were reported for that year, 11 ranking measles the 19th leading cause of death worldwide. accelerated measles control efforts have led to a decrease in measles-related deaths by 71% from 2000 to 2011. in 2003, WHO established the measles and rubella Laboratory Network to strengthen capabilities for rubella and CRS case identification and confirmation. the incorporation of rubella/CRS into measles surveillance systems and expanded use of rubella-containing measles vaccines in a number of countries99 provided an opportunity for the Measles Initiative to broaden its mission. as of September 13, 2013, all six WHO regions had committed to regional measles elimination goals by 2020. in 2008, these countries accounted for 98% of measles-related deaths. since 2007, donor investments in the MRI have decreased by 55%. a $10 million funding gap has led to the postponement of vaccine campaigns and campaign activities. the ASH should advocate to the HHS Secretary that completion of these goals will yield significant economic and public health returns on investments. the continued march toward success for both the GPEI and the MRI are made possible through the contributions and tireless efforts of their partners in the public and private sectors. CDC contributed to the procurement of about 289 million doses of OPV in 2009. but in 2010, CDC funding for OPV was not sufficient to meet all country needs. in 2010, CDC funding for OPV resulted in the reduction of available funds for other non-vaccine-related support. CDC includes global immunization activities as a line item in its annual appropriations request to Congress. the majority of this funding is allocated to activities that support polio eradication and the control of measles. the program targets 90% of the annual global immunizations budget to directly support mission-critical activities in the field. NVAC recommendations 1.3 and 1.4: enhancing CDC technical assistance for reaching polio eradication and measles mortality reduction goals. the ASH should encourage CDC to continue to enhance the public health impact of its Stop Transmission of Polio (STOP) program. the CDC Measles/Rubella Laboratory facilitates measles and rubella outbreak control efforts at the national, regional, and global levels. in 2009, CDC's Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory supported the introduction of new laboratory procedures that reduced the time to detect and confirm polio infections by 50%. CDC assistance has included targeted operational support for disease control and eradication in high-risk countries. CDC has lengthened STOP Team member assignments from three months to five months to meet the increasing demands for trained technical assistance by the GPEI. the program's success has created opportunities to expand the work of the STOP Teams to include support for measles mortality reduction efforts and other global immunization efforts. o-endemic countries build country-level capacity and country ownership to support programmatic activities. the program's success has created opportunities to expand the work of the STOP Teams to include support for measles mortality reduction efforts and other global immunization efforts. the outcome measure for a successful vaccination program is the reduction in overall disease burden related to the number of people vaccinated against that disease. a national immunization program is evaluated by monitoring the accuracy and reach of vaccine coverage and by measuring the impact the program has had on reducing the disease burden within a population. national rates of immunization coverage are reported to the WHO and UNICEF through the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Process. each year, national rates of immunization coverage of routine childhood vaccinations, cases of VPDs and indicators of immunization system performance are reported to the WHO and UNICEF through the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Process. administrative immunization coverage data are needed to manage immunization program performance and allocate resources to identify ongoing inefficiencies. administrative data may be subject to inaccuracies due to staffing restraints, challenges with immunization recordkeeping, quality of supervision of data collection. experts suggest improvements to data collection systems could include creating free-of-charge birth registrars to improve estimates of the target population size or establishing vaccine registries housed in health facilities. establishing immunization registries at the national or district level does not necessarily require the creation or uptake of new and expensive technologies. reliable household surveys include the WHO EPI Cluster Surveys, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator -Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys supported by USAID. these surveys collect immunization coverage data at the household level by gathering information on children's immunization status through immunization cards kept and updated by each family or parent. household survey data collection is considered essential to assure a more accurate estimation of immunization coverage. 136,141,142 suggestions include integrating coverage surveys into other monitoring processes at the district level. mobile and digital technologies are being explored as a user-friendly way to improve field data collection. mobile and digital technologies are also being explored as a user-friendly way to improve field data collection. NVAC recommendation 2.2: strengthening global VPD surveillance capacity The ASH should work with other HHS offices to develop sustainable support for quality global VPD surveillance systems. this support ideally should include technical and financial resources needed to support early warning/outbreak surveillance; laboratory diagnostics; emergency communication systems to detect and respond to outbreaks of VPDs. surveillance requirements for the eradication of targeted VPDs include case-based polio, measles, and rubella surveillance. global goals to accelerate access to new and underutilized vaccines in low- and middle-income countries will require additional resources to create and expand surveillance and laboratory capabilities. the framework seeks to expand access to high-quality national laboratories and WHO-accredited regional reference laboratories. the poliomyelitis surveillance network currently provides a structure for rapidly detecting and responding to diseases of national and international importance. however, recent experience trying to build surveillance for diseases preventable by the newer vaccines on the polio network suggests that polio infrastructure does not work well for all VPD surveillance. measles/rubella laboratory network expanded by leveraging existing laboratory and administrative infrastructure. 152,156 The WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network now includes 690 laboratories. 159,160 The WHO-African Region (WHO/AFRO) member countries have used the infrastructure created from polio surveillance systems as a platform to implement an Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response strategy. the IDSR strategy integrates district-level surveillance activities for a number of VPDs and other high-priority diseases to streamline resources and strengthen public health response. decision makers need to accurately estimate the disease burden of VPDs. new vaccines may have different objectives than for polio and measles surveillance. new vaccines, such as the regional conjugate meningococcal vaccine, aim to eliminate epidemic diseases. surveillance data must be collected during a sufficient time frame to accurately capture the epidemiology of disease in a given region. new vaccine sentinel surveillance has been more readily achievable for rotavirus, for which it was easier to use some of the existing polio surveillance infrastructure. global influenza virological surveillance has been conducted through the WHO's global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for more than half a century. CDC led preliminary efforts to use existing polio and measles/rubella networks in Bangladesh, china, and India to monitor for viral and bacterial VPDs. all VPD laboratory networks are tiered, with the number of levels dependent on surveillance questions addressed at each level. most networks have at least three levels, originally designated as National Laboratories, Regional Reference Laboratories, and Global Specialized Reference Laboratories. CDC has recently participated and copartnered with the WHO, NGOs, and academic institutions on vaccine introduction initiatives. funding was provided to support multiple surveillance activities to measure disease burden and monitor the impact of newly introduced vaccines. CDC has supported more than 50 countries since 2003 to develop laboratory and epidemiologic capacity to conduct surveillance for influenza disease. NVAC recommendation 2.3: building country-level surveillance capacity through CDC's FE(L)TPs. a key barrier to incorporating sustainable VPD surveillance and laboratory networks into routine immunization programs is an insufficient number of competent, trained public health personnel. the FE(L)TP includes an additional competency-based training component to support laboratory surveillance and outbreak response. FE(L)TPs are initiated in countries through partnerships with CDC, the WHO, ministries of health, and donors or development agencies. CDC provides an in-country resident technical advisor to aid in program development and training for four to six years. countries expected to take on increasing financial and technical responsibility of the program over time. global immunization coverage with DTP3 rose to 83% in 2011 from only 23% in 1981,7,113 large inequalities persist. low-income countries continue to have lower immunization coverage than high-income countries. poorest children are the least likely to receive immunizations. the RED/C approach uses five tactics in an effort to overcome common obstacles to increasing immunization coverage among hard-to-reach populations. the RED/C approach encourages the use of coverage data to prioritize districts that need the most help in improving access and utilization of immunizations. implementation of the RED/C approach reportedly increased the frequency of supportive supervisory visits to local immunization providers, with increased constructive feedback on how to improve immunization services. researchers noted that further research is needed to examine the sustainability of the impact of the RED/C approach on immunization coverage. many of the identified parental attitudes regarding vaccinations may be proxies for more complex health-seeking behaviors and perceived barriers. complex emergencies can create situations that promote the spread of VPDs among vulnerable refugee populations. many of these countries, immunization levels are typically lower than in most developed countries. measles vaccination with SIAs during complex emergencies is a very cost-effective prevention strategy. complex emergencies such as political conflicts account for 50,000\u201375,000 refugees who enter and resettle in the united states each year. in 2006, only 50% of refugee children aged 0\u201335 months were completely up-to-date on immunizations 15 months after resettlement. 23% of refugees never completed their initial health assessment. estimated cost of immunizing refugees overseas prior to arrival in the u.s. is substantially lower due to the lowered cost of vaccines provided internationally by UNICEF. NVAC recommendation 2.6: strategies to improve immunization supply and logistics management. insufficient vaccine supply chains can further exacerbate challenges to providing immunization services for hard-to-reach populations. poorly managed or under-resourced logistics systems can weaken already fragile immunization programs. the action plan is organized under five priority areas (or tenets):249 Introduce innovative vaccine products and packaging that are tailored to meet the needs and constraints of developing countries. include human resources policies that provide adequate numbers of trained, motivated, and empowered personnel at all levels of the system. UNICEF is now partnering with the WHO and TechNet to create an iSCL Hub. the iSCL Hub will provide partners with resources, guidelines, policies, and technical assistance for capacity building and coordination of ongoing CCL initiatives. Project Optimize has developed a traveling exhibit on vaccine supply chains and logistics systems. the exhibit is titled \u201cSupply Systems for Today and Tomorrow\u201d to reach audiences and share information on how different countries can use the knowledge of potential solutions and remaining gaps. the use of existing vaccines outside the traditional cold chain has the potential to reduce costs, increase program flexibility, and improve the number of people reached by vaccination efforts. however, data must support that temperature variations do not affect the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. the PAHO Revolving Fund and the UNICEF supply division collect demand forecasts from participating countries. demand forecasts are dependent on each country's programmatic requirements including current coverage rates, target populations, estimated wastage, information about current stocks, and stock-outs experienced by the country. the NVAC recommendation 2.7: integrating health services with immunization programs to optimize health delivery systems. the ASH should work with the OGA and CDC to assist national governments, development agencies, and civil society in encouraging the use of immunization contacts. global health programs are competing against multiple health and non-health priorities for scarce donor and in-country resources. efforts to link immunization with other essential health interventions can lead to improved efficiency in public health services. integrating other health interventions with immunization at outreach sessions requires a series of carefully planned and implemented steps. these steps include: (1) selecting interventions that can be feasibly integrated at the outreach level; (2) instituting inter-sector coordination at all program levels; (3) exploring service funding sources; (3) conducting joint training and supervision of health workers and program managers; and (5) ensuring the participation of community-based organizations, leaders, and volunteers. CDC has been at the forefront of evaluating the role of immunization systems. 211 CDC works with other global immunization partners to incorporate strong evaluation and operations research into the integration of services and systems. if disease incidence is high, the benefits of vaccination are clear and more accepted by the public. a community that is engaged and invested in its immunization program has higher rates of coverage. the NVAC is currently conducting a comprehensive analysis on vaccine confidence. the findings will be detailed in a future NVAC report. the outcome measure for a successful vaccination program is the reduction in overall disease burden related to the number of people vaccinated against that disease. the performance of a national immunization program is evaluated by monitoring the accuracy and reach of vaccine coverage and by measuring the impact the program has had on reducing the disease burden within a population. data quality is important in evaluating program weaknesses and identifying areas for improvement. official coverage estimates often based on administrative data of doses administered in clinics divided by estimates of the target population to be vaccinated. administrative data are calculated by dividing the number of vaccine doses administered to children in the target age group by the estimated number of children in the target age group within the population. administrative data may be subject to inaccuracies due to a number of factors such as staffing restraints, challenges with immunization recordkeeping, quality of supervision of data collection, and logistical barriers. the country of Oman successfully sustained immunization coverage of 98% for 10 years using a paper-based registry. 127,131,132 governments and NGOs have launched a series of programs to improve vaccine coverage data and data usage. the UNICEF MICS is a more extensive survey with a variety of health indicators117 that relies heavily on random sampling to ensure representative sampling of the population. despite household survey data being held as the gold standard when estimating immunization coverage,140 household survey data are subject to a variety of biases and misreporting issues. the frequency of regular multi-topic health surveys may vary depending on the scope and purpose of the household survey in question. data quality might be improved by increasing the publicity, promotion, and availability of immunization cards and improving communication between parents and health-care providers. RAMP survey method allows for more accurate collection of a range of information, including local population size and composition, household survey data, and real-time data on children living in areas that are difficult to reach. pilot-testing has focused on monitoring and evaluating malaria programs in Kenya, Namibia, and Nigeria. administrative data may be subject to inaccuracies due to factors such as staffing restraints, challenges with immunization recordkeeping, quality of supervision of data collection, and logistical barriers to communicating coverage data. key barriers to achieving accurate immunization coverage data are (1) poor recording and reporting of immunization data. 127,131,132 governments and NGOs have launched a series of programs to improve vaccine coverage data and data usage. several tools are available to improve administrative data collection and quality. the UNICEF MICS is a more extensive survey with a variety of health indicators117 that relies heavily on random sampling to ensure representative sampling of the population. despite household survey data being held as the gold standard when estimating immunization coverage,140 household survey data are also subject to a variety of biases and misreporting issues. the applicability of these suggestions may vary depending on the scope and purpose of the household survey in question. it has also been suggested that data collectors should request that parents recall their children's immunizations before being asked to produce the child's immunization card. the RAMP survey method allows for more accurate collection of a range of information, including local population size and composition, household survey data, and real-time data on children living in areas that are difficult to reach. CDC's Strengthening Quality and Use of Immunization Data (SQUID) team of the global immunoization division (GID) works with WHO regional and country partners to improve data quality. the GIVS, the GVAP, the NVP, and the CDC Global Immunization Strategic Framework highlight the role of VPD surveillance in strengthening the capacity for global immunization systems. the GIVS, the GVAP, the NVP, and the CDC Global Immunization Strategic Framework. the framework seeks to expand access to high-quality national laboratories and WHO-accredited regional reference laboratories. resources required for adequate surveillance and program monitoring are minimal compared with program costs of implementing immunization programs. the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network was established as a key strategy in achieving polio eradication through case-based surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). 146,153 Eradication certification criteria require that every case of AFP is investigated and confirmed through laboratory diagnostics. the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network now includes 690 laboratories with a large number of laboratories at the subnational, national, regional, and global levels. the network laboratories employ a systematic testing approach using well-validated assays, common quality-control indicators, and standardized reagents and procedures. the IDSR strategy uses an action threshold approach for each specified disease that triggers coordinated activities for each tier of the surveillance system. many countries do not include VPD surveillance and laboratory support in their national immunization budget planning. most countries have established hospital-based sentinel surveillance sites that can provide a description of the distribution of disease due to various pathogens. sentinel surveillance for bacterial meningitis can identify the proportion of disease due to hib, Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or influenza. polio and measles/rubella surveillance networks require more intensive support and rapid processing of specimens such as cerebrospinal fluid. funding for these expanded activities is not broadly supported by global initiatives, and lower- and middle-income countries may struggle to meet the core capacities required to inform public health investments in newer vaccines. global influenza virological surveillance has been conducted through the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for more than half a century. the new name came into effect following the adoption of the pandemic influenza preparedness Framework in may 2011. CDC serves as a Global Specialized Reference Laboratory to a number of WHO-coordinated laboratory networks. responsibilities vary with the disease agent but include distribution of reagents, cell lines, primary virus and bacterial isolation and confirmation. CDC has recently participated and copartnered with the WHO, NGOs, and academic institutions on many vaccine introduction initiatives supported by the GAVI Alliance. CDC's global disease Detection and Emergency Response program contributes to strengthening VPD surveillance and laboratory capacity at the global, regional, and local levels. the GDDER has assisted in response efforts for a number of VPD outbreaks including measles, meningitis, polio and cholera outbreaks. poliomyelitis surveillance network currently provides a structure for rapidly detecting and responding to diseases of national and international importance. however, recent experience trying to build surveillance for diseases preventable by the newer vaccines on the polio network suggests that polio infrastructure does not work well for all VPD surveillance. the network comprises 146 laboratories organized in a three-tiered system that operates in all six WHO regions. lab-confirmed surveillance is dependent on meeting set performance standards for timeliness, workload, operational procedures, and proficiencies in isolating and serotyping virus from specimens. the global MRI began implementing case-based surveillance. the global Polio and Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Networks have successfully established high-quality national laboratories in resource-limited countries, war-torn countries, and countries with little to no public health infrastructure.152,157,158 Surveillance medical officers trained in these networks have responded to outbreaks of cholera, dengue, hemorrhagic fevers and malaria. new and underutilized vaccines have highlighted the need for more local data. new and underutilized vaccines include hepatitis B, rubella, rotavirus, influenza, conjugate Hib, conjugate pneumococcal and meningococcal, and human papillomavirus (HPV) eptococcus pneumoniae, or influenza, can provide the proportion due to rotavirus. such surveillance can provide data on the distribution of the strains responsible for disease within a country. such surveillance can provide data on the distribution of the strains responsible for disease within a country. global initiatives have begun to formalize and systematize epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance for diseases targeted by new and underutilized vaccines. CDC led preliminary efforts to use existing polio and measles/rubella networks in Bangladesh, China, and India to monitor for viral and bacterial VPDs. the new name came into effect following the adoption of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework in may 2011. there are currently 140 NICs in 117 countries. the role of HHS in global VPD surveillance is tied. za Surveillance and Response System, the global Invasive Bacterial Disease Surveillance Network, and the global Invasive Bacterial Disease Surveillance Network. the responsibilities of Global Reference Laboratories vary with the disease agent but include distribution of reagents, cell lines, primary virus and bacterial isolation and confirmation. the networks include development and distribution of proficiency panels, parallel testing of specimens, serotyping or serogrouping, genetic sequencing, serological diagnosis, CDC's global disease Detection and Emergency Response program contributes to strengthening VPD surveillance and laboratory capacity at the global, regional, and local levels. the program serves to build the country-level surveillance capacity needed to implement the international health regulations. NVAC recommendation 2.3: building country-level surveillance capacity through CDC's FE(L)TPs. training modules consist of courses in epidemiology, communications, economics, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance systems. FE(L)TPs are initiated in countries through partnerships with CDC, the WHO, ministries of health, and donors or development agencies. regional networks have grown up that have been critical in supporting the expansion and growth of national programs. one such network, the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), has been essential in promoting the growth of epidemiology training throughout sub-saharan Africa. NVAC recommendation 2.4: improving the delivery of immunization services\u2014reaching every district/community. poor quality of health services, missed opportunities, hidden financial and opportunity costs were the most cited reasons for why children were not immunized. the RED/C approach uses five tactics in an effort to overcome common obstacles to increasing immunization coverage among hard-to-reach populations. the RED/C approach encourages the use of coverage data to prioritize districts that need the most help in improving access and utilization of immunizations. most countries in the WHO regions of africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific have used the RED/C approach in their efforts to extend routine immunization to all populations. a total of 901 reasons and factors associated with the unimmunized child were identified from these 209 articles. of these reasons and factors, 393 (44%) were related to immunization systems, 255 (28%) were related to parental attitudes and knowledge, 199 (22%) were linked to family characteristics, and 58 (6%) were associated with communication and information. a total of 901 reasons and factors associated with the unimmunized child were identified from these 209 articles. of these reasons and factors, 393 (44%) were related to immunization systems, 255 (28%) were related to parental attitudes and knowledge, 199 (22%) were linked to family characteristics, and 58 (6%) were associated with communication and information. complex emergencies can create situations that promote the spread of VPDs among vulnerable refugee populations. in many of these countries, immunization levels are typically lower than in most developed countries. many refugees arrive from countries with low vaccination rates, possessing poor or no vaccination documentation,233 resulting in concentrated populations susceptible to VPDs. 215,233\u2013239 Immunization of refugees prior to their arrival in the united states can prevent costly outbreak control efforts and added morbidity caused by disease importations. 7 u.s.-bound refugees with data available in the CDC Information on Migrant Populations database were estimated to cost $25,990,579 in the U.S. compared with only $7,706,026 to vaccinate these refugees overseas. CDC/DGMQ and the state department are collaborating with partners to conduct a vaccination pilot program for U.S.-bound refugees in five countries. poorly managed or under-resourced logistics systems can weaken already fragile immunization programs. weak systems can lead to significant vaccine wastage and vaccine stock-outs. inadequate vaccine supply chain capacity may cause unnecessary delays in the introduction of new vaccines. the action plan is organized under five priority areas (or tenets):249 Introduce innovative vaccine products and packaging that are tailored to meet the needs and constraints of developing countries. Facilitate efficient and effective vaccine delivery and leverage proven methods from other sectors. Assess and minimize the environmental impact of energy, materials, and processes used. Include human resources policies that provide adequate numbers of trained, motivated, and empowered personnel at all levels of the system. project Optimize (2007\u20132012) was initiated to innovate, demonstrate, and facilitate advances in the vaccine supply chain through the use of new and emerging technologies. in 2008, Project Optimize conducted a number of landscape analyses and stakeholder workshops to provide comprehensive picture of the existing vaccine supply chain. the vaccine was developed specifically for protection against type A meningococcal disease in sub-saharan africa. many countries that comprise the meningitis belt have limited cold chain capacity. the FDA is working with the WHO to develop scientifically appropriate guidelines for vaccine use that can be used to support handling at the temperature extremes encountered during vaccine transport and delivery during immunization campaigns. addressing these key issues will be necessary to further facilitate the distribution of other vaccines such as hepatitis B and OPV. overcoming challenges to accurate vaccine forecasting and logistics management at the country level will include solutions at the local levels to better track vaccine usage and overall demand. overcoming challenges to accurate vaccine forecasting and logistics management at the country level will include solutions at the local levels to better track vaccine usage and overall demand. the taskforce first met in 2007 as an initiative to strengthen and expand vaccine supply chain and logistics capacity within national immunization programs. the taskforce is divided into five subgroups focusing on guidance, monitoring, advocacy, integration, and systems of the future. the UNICEF CCL Taskforce has collaborated with TechNet-21.org to provide a Web page offering resources such as recommended guidelines and best practices for better management of national vaccine supply chain and logistic systems. the iSCL Hub will provide partners with resources, guidelines, policies, and technical assistance for capacity building and coordination of ongoing CCL initiatives. project optimizee has developed information systems, training tools, and operational models that were tested and evaluated in the field. the results of these projects are shared at conferences, workshops, in a quarterly newsletter (Op.ti.mize), 253 and on the PATH, WHO, and TechNet-21 websites. the CTC approach was considered easy to implement and preferable by vaccinators and supervisors. the approach showed numerous benefits including reduced wastage and greater flexibility. the use of existing vaccines outside the traditional cold chain has the potential to reduce costs. PPAG includes members from the international Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, the Developing Country Vaccine Manufacturers Network, WHO, PATH, UNICEF, CDC, USAID, GAVI Alliance, and others. overcoming challenges to accurate vaccine forecasting and logistics management at the country level will include solutions at the local levels to better track vaccine usage and overall demand. the GAVI Alliance has recently partnered with the telecoms company Vodafone and the U.K. Department of International Development to use mobile technologies to help immunization programs in remote locations in sub-saharan Africa manage their vaccine stocks. the program is based on Vodafone's success in providing mobile stock management services to track malaria treatments in more than 5,000 clinics across Tanzania. a study in Zambia linked immunization to multiple child health interventions in a routine setting. the current state of the global economy creates circumstances where global health programs are competing against multiple health and non-health priorities. efforts to link immunization with other essential health interventions can lead to improved efficiency in public health services. if non-vaccine interventions were integrated with routine vaccination, coverage for all interventions examined could be substantially higher than current levels. the ability to efficiently deliver multiple non-vaccine interventions along with routine vaccinations would depend on many factors, including acceptability of the selected services to the public and health providers. integrated programs can mitigate risks that are intrinsic to the bundling of services or systems. coverage, quality, acceptability, complexity, and unintended consequences should be examined. CDC is at the forefront of evaluating the role of immunization systems. public health researchers are studying ways to analyze factors that contribute to community demand for vaccines. current studies are investigating global patterns of vaccine safety concerns being voiced in the news and social media to better understand and address concerns. the NVAC is currently conducting a comprehensive analysis on vaccine confidence. the findings will be detailed in a future NVAC report. CDC has been at the forefront of evaluating the role of immunization systems. public health researchers are studying ways to analyze factors that contribute to community demand for vaccines. current studies are investigating global patterns of vaccine safety concerns being voiced in the news and social media to better understand and address misperception of vaccine safety. the NVAC is conducting a comprehensive analysis on vaccine confidence and its impact on vaccination programs. the findings will be detailed in a future NVAC report. the growing global demand for vaccines has generated new opportunities for developing countries to actively participate in the development and manufacture of vaccines. a lack of a coordinated vaccine safety system, poor risk communication strategies, or a weak capacity to rapidly conduct scientific investigation in response to real or alleged safety concerns can negatively impact vaccination campaigns. manufacturers in different countries may have different regulatory standards and capacities than the countries in which the vaccines will be used. countries that manufacture vaccines for PAHO and UNICEF procurement must meet WHO prequalification standards for vaccine formulation, manufacturing, and quality control. the GACVS comprises vaccine safety experts from different academic disciplines, sectors, and countries. they provide validation of vaccine safety profiles for all WHO prequalified vaccines, assessments of causality for severe adverse events linked in time to vaccines, and judgment in defining high-risk populations. 65% of WHO member states do not have post-marketing vaccine safety monitoring systems in place. this assumption proved untrue in most cases and highlighted a significant gap in AEFI reporting. current unmet needs include a lack of clear mandates to carry out post-marketing surveillance for AEFIs, the legal authority to take action when vaccine safety signals are detected. by 2011, the PMS Network included 12 eligible LMICs. half reported AEFIs to a centralized database run by the uppsala monitoring centre. the results of the pilot project underscored many of the important challenges described previously. the Brighton Collaboration has developed more than 20 standardized case definitions for use in pre-licensure, post-licensure, and post-marketing vaccine safety studies. AEFI-specific working groups have also developed bridging tools, such as AEFI-specific reporting forms, checklists, and term glossaries, to facilitate uptake and implementation of the case definitions. vaccination safety data also provides a powerful tool for detecting and verifying rare or unexpected vaccine safety signals. participants have the option to use common software to enter vaccine safety information collected through national pharmacovigilance centers, NRAs, and/or national immunization programs. the WHO provides training modules and learning opportunities for national public health officials, immunization program managers, vaccination staff, and AEFI review committees. the resource centre includes Web-based courses on vaccine safety, training workshops, and vaccine safety training toolkits that are intended to build vaccine safety capacity within countries. the blueprint is organized into eight objectives that will achieve each of the Blueprint's three overarching goals. under each objective, a rationale is provided in the Blueprint that justifies why the objective is included. a rationale is provided in the Blueprint that justifies why the objective is included, as well as target indicators for achieving the objective. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER are actively involved in global efforts to standardize vaccine safety case definitions and create harmonized tools for better AEFI detection and response. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER are actively involved in global efforts to standardize vaccine safety case definitions and create harmonized tools for better AEFI detection and response. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER participated in an international study to assess the risk of Guillan-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic vaccines. meanwhile, CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER support global vaccine safety capacity building. Vaccine pharmacovigilance is defined as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding, prevention, and communication of adverse events following immunization. a lack of a coordinated vaccine safety system, poor risk communication strategies, or a weak capacity to rapidly conduct scientific investigation in response to real or alleged safety concerns can negatively impact vaccination campaigns. vaccines are associated with a risk of adverse reactions. vaccines undergo stringent safety testing during clinical trials prior to their licensure. but often the size and composition of clinical trials may not be large enough. the need to monitor for rare or unexpected AEFIs is especially true in LMICs. many vaccines currently under development, such as those targeting dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis. the GACVS serves as a global forum to discuss new and evolving information on vaccine safety and vaccine safety-related efforts. the work of the GACVS includes supporting, through expert input and evaluation, the drafting and implementation of a WHO-led global vaccine safety strategy. regulations and guidelines establish the roles and responsibilities for vaccine safety among the regulatory authorities, the national vaccine program, and vaccine manufacturers. there was general agreement that a global vaccine safety information database would create opportunities to actively collect, aggregate, analyze, and report vaccine safety data, which could enhance causality assessments and investigations. access to reliable vaccine safety information, educational materials on the risks and benefits of vaccinations, and a well-developed vaccine safety crisis communications plan are necessary to maintain public trust and participation in vaccination programs. lack of harmonized tools, such as standard AEFI reporting forms, common databases and compatible information-sharing platforms, are major barriers to achieving a truly global vaccine safety support structure. s have been used for both passive and active AEFI surveillance activities. s have been used for both passive and active AEFI surveillance activities. s have been used for both passive and active AEFI surveillance activities. the VaccineGRID is an international health information technology platform for linking and sharing health-care information online from diverse health-care databases. this partnership allows public health agencies, health-care organizations, and academics to collaborate on large-scale, hypothesis-driven vaccine safety studies. the global Vaccine Safety Blueprint is organized into eight objectives that will achieve each of the Blueprint's three overarching goals. the blueprint is organized into eight objectives that will achieve each of the Blueprint's three overarching goals. the global Vaccine Safety Initiative is charged with creating a global vaccine safety support structure. it includes a detailed work plan for implementing and achieving the vision outlined in the Blueprint. the work product portfolio currently includes more than 80 proposed or ongoing vaccine safety capacity-building activities. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER are actively involved in global efforts to standardize vaccine safety case definitions and create harmonized tools for better AEFI detection and response. both entities support the Brighton Collaboration by reviewing manuscripts and case definitions as part of the AEFI working groups. many LMICs are limited in their ability to successfully implement vaccine pharmacovigilance activities because of insufficient regulatory capacity. in 2012, FDA/CBER awarded a cooperative agreement grant to the WHO to support innovative approaches to vaccine clinical trial design and use of pharmacovigilance tools. manufacturers in different countries may have different regulatory standards and capacities than the countries in which the vaccines will be used. manufacturers must meet WHO prequalification standards for vaccine formulation, manufacturing, and quality control set by the WHO's expert committee on Biological standardization. the global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) was established in 1999 as a group of experts who provide the WHO with an independent evaluation of vaccine safety signals and vaccine safety assessments. the GACVS comprises vaccine safety experts from different academic disciplines, sectors, and countries, and has included representatives from CDC and the FDA. landscape analysis commissioned by the WHO to provide greater situational awareness of the key barriers to creating an effective global vaccine safety system. 65% of WHO member states, including the majority of LMICs, do not have post-marketing vaccine safety monitoring systems in place. lack of technology infrastructure, such as limited computer access and insufficient Internet capabilities, restricted a country's ability to contribute comprehensive reports. a lack of standardized tools within and between countries causes data collected from different countries to be incomparable. the Brighton Collaboration was formed in 2000 as an independent partnership of volunteers to generate, evaluate, and communicate high-quality information about vaccine safety. AEFI case definitions comprise of the definitions themselves as well as guidelines for the collection, analysis, and presentation of vaccine safety data developed by AEFI-specific working groups. currently, the Brighton Collaboration has developed more than 20 standardized case definitions for use in pre-licensure, post-licensure, and post-marketing vaccine safety studies. international representatives from all sectors to deliberate on consensus definitions and evaluation tools for vaccine pharmacovigilance efforts. the ability to coordinate linked datasets of spontaneously reported AEFIs and relevant vaccine safety data also provides a powerful tool for detecting and verifying rare or unexpected vaccine safety signals. the WHO provides training modules and learning opportunities for national public health officials, immunization program managers, vaccination staff, and members of AEFI review committees. the resource centre includes Web-based courses on vaccine safety, training workshops, and vaccine safety training toolkits that are intended to build vaccine safety capacity within countries. the blueprint is organized into eight objectives that will achieve each of the Blueprint's three overarching goals. the objectives described in the Blueprint are shown in Figure 5. Overview of the vision, goals, and objectives outlined in the 2011 WHO Global Vaccine Safety Blueprinta a World Health Organization. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER are actively involved in global efforts to standardize vaccine safety case definitions. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER are actively involved in global efforts to standardize vaccine safety case definitions and create harmonized tools for better AEFI detection and response. 335 CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER have collaborated with the UMC in comparing pediatric AEFIs reported to VAERS and reports sent to Vigibase. this pilot project will serve as a foundation for subsequent collaborations with UMC. CDC/ISO and FDA/CBER support global vaccine safety capacity building through participation in the development of a Pan American Vaccine Safety Network. NVAC RECOMMENDATION 4: BUILDING GLOBAL IMMUNIZATION R&D CAPACITY Vaccine R&D is a global enterprise. advances in vaccinology are allowing the global community to overcome challenges to vaccine development and extend the benefits of immunization to new target populations. a robust global capacity for vaccine development and manufacturing will create a world that is better prepared to respond to and protect against new or evolving infectious disease threats. the ASH should support efforts that increase global health research capacity through partnerships between health research institutions in the u.s. and abroad. studies indicate that adjuvants boost the effectiveness of antigens. allowing less antigen to be used per dose, thus maximizing vaccine supplies when needed to meet sudden global demands. advances in vaccine technologies have led to the discovery and development of new vaccines. needle-free technologies reduce biohazardous waste, minimize risks of accidental needle-sticks, and prevent the reuse of disposable materials that can lead to transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients. needle-free systems can also alleviate fears related to injections, creating the potential for higher acceptance and better completion within populations. advances in immunization programs would also benefit from advances in operations and implementation research to identify and overcome programmatic and logistical barriers to routine immunizations and the introduction of new or underutilized vaccines. studies to assess immunization program effectiveness and best practices will facilitate the development of tools and strategies to best meet the health needs of developing countries. interdisciplinary approaches will be necessary to create novel strategies for tackling VPDs. in 2011, NIH funded approximately $1.7 billion in vaccine-related research (total of all research activities) multiple NIH institutes support research projects on all aspects of vaccines, immunizations, and global health. NIH was identified as the single largest funder of neglected disease research. despite many important scientific advances, the vaccine development pipeline continues to be challenged by high risk and rising costs. the majority of vaccine candidates do not progress successfully through the product development pipeline. new strategies are being used to stimulate R&D efforts for less lucrative vaccines specifically intended to address the needs of developing countries. the decade of Vaccines GVAP does not outline a list of global vaccine R&D priorities in recognition that these priorities may be country-specific. however, the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research Strategic Plan (2010\u20132020) was developed to establish a global research agenda to guide the WHO and others in developing research priorities, standards, and guidelines. product development partnerships (PDPs) have played a major role in stimulating R&D activities for vaccines by uniting resources and efforts across academia, NGOs, and the public and private sectors. a study noted that government funding of PDPs through agencies such as USAID increased from 7% of their total support in 2000 to 34% in 2007. the vaccine was licensed in 2009 under the name MenAfriVac. it earned prequalification status by the WHO in 2010. 100 million doses of the vaccine were administered in 10 countries. NVAC recommendation 4.4: harmonizing regulatory standards to support global vaccine development The ASH should support efforts to strengthen NRAs in other countries through collaborations with the FDA. the use of standardized tools and procedures can also strengthen the capabilities of existing regulatory authorities. the ICH developed a common technical document to harmonize the documentation needed for a new drug application among the three ICH regions. this platform saves both time and resources by providing a common electronic format for documenting and submitting technical data requirements. the common technical document also benefits regulatory agencies by facilitating the exchange of information during the review process. 27 manufacturers in 21 countries have achieved prequalification status. only 58 out of 193 member countries had functional NRAs. several countries where clinical trials were planned had inadequate regulatory capabilities. the AVAREF convenes biannually and includes representatives from the NRAs, ethics committees, and scientific advisory committees of 19 African countries. the forum's efforts are focused on promoting communication and collaboration among member countries and cooperating partners such as the FDA, vaccine manufacturers, and clinical trial sponsors. NVAC recommendation 4.5: supporting the emergence of developing country vaccine manufacturers. in-country or regional manufacturing of vaccines provides the advantage of manufacturers working closely with national immunization programs.401,402 Importantly, the increased number of developing country vaccine manufacturers involved in vaccine production contributes to the overall supply of vaccines. global community is leveraging the DCVM Network to increase vaccine manufacturing to maximize vaccine production capacity. global production capacity for seasonal influenza vaccines fell several billion doses below the number needed to protect the world in the event of a severe influenza pandemic. 90% of the world's population does not reside in countries with influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity. 404 HHS leadership in ensuring global influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity for pandemic influenza preparedness. these efforts have been a priority for HHS, and a number of HHS offices and agencies coordinate with the WHO to contribute to the GAP. 407 BARDA, part of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, has also assisted the WHO in expanding influenza vaccine manufacturing in 10 countries, including Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Thailand, and Vietnam. in 2011, BARDA collaborated with the WHO, Utah State University, and North Carolina State University to initiate a series of three-week industry-focused training courses for DCVM. NIAID is working closely with academia and industry to explore the development of universal influenza vaccines based on highly conserved regions of the influenza virus. such vaccines could obviate the need for annual reformulation and could be readily manufactured in the event of a pandemic. the ASH should support efforts that increase global health research capacity through partnerships between health research institutions in the united states and abroad. basic scientific discovery has been instrumental in creating opportunities for new vaccine development. in the past 30 years, basic scientific discovery has been instrumental in creating opportunities for new vaccine development. a number of DNA vaccines have entered clinical trials, including dengue vaccine candidates. there is considerable interest in using adjuvants as a tool to improve the effectiveness of vaccines to broader patient populations. needle-free systems reduce biohazardous waste, minimize the risks of accidental needle-sticks, and prevent the reuse of disposable materials. needle-free systems can also alleviate fears related to injections, creating the potential for higher acceptance and better completion within populations. more than 1.4 billion doses of vaccines will be delivered to people in remote settings. more than 359 VVMs are available to indicate if vaccines have been frozen. research on the stability and potency of existing vaccines outside of the standard cold-chain temperature range. the WHO is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the recommended childhood vaccine schedules to identify epidemiologic, social, and economic considerations. studies to assess immunization program effectiveness and best practices will facilitate the development of tools and strategies to best meet the health needs of developing countries. in 2011, NIH funded approximately $1.7 billion in vaccine-related research (total of all research activities) multiple NIH institutes support research projects on all aspects of vaccines, immunizations, and global health. NIH was identified as the single largest funder of neglected disease research. a systematic review of injection safety in developing countries found that a significant number of injections were deemed unsafe in such countries mainly due to improper reuse of disposable syringes. in 1999, a systematic review of injection safety in developing countries found that a significant number of injections were deemed unsafe in such countries mainly due to improper reuse of disposable syringes. Vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) were developed in 1996 as a technology to identify and discard vaccines that had been damaged by excessive heat exposure. a HEATmarkerTM (Temptime Corporation, Morris Plains, New Jersey) present on the vaccine labels. the technology allows vaccinators to quickly identify damaged vaccine stocks. progress is being made in gaining a greater understanding of emerging infectious diseases and neglected diseases and their impact on global populations. in some cases, these gaps include a basic understanding of pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, the role of specific antigens in eliciting a protective response, or a better understanding of how findings in animal models correlate with human disease. the NIH funded approximately $1.7 billion in vaccine-related research (total of all research activities) in 2011, NIH funded approximately $1.7 billion in vaccine-related research (total of all research activities) FIC has supported more than 5,000 scientists in LMICs in investigator-led research and research training programs. each year more than 2,500 scientists from outside of the united states work within intramural NIH laboratories on a number of global health issues. NVAC recommendations 4.2 and 4.3: vaccine R&D capacity\u2014strategies to bring forth the next generation of vaccines Recommendation 4.3 The ASH should encourage HHS agencies to work closely with USAID, WHO, UNICEF, GAVI developers have previously focused on vaccines that meet the demands of high-priced markets. in 1993, vaccine sales in high-income countries comprised only 12% of the global volume yet generated 82% of the total revenue. new strategies are being used to stimulate R&D efforts for less lucrative vaccines. software prioritizes vaccine products based on attributes chosen and weighted by the user. attributes span broad categories such as disease burden, business opportunities, economic considerations, demographic considerations, scientific/technical considerations, public concerns, programmatic considerations and policy considerations. the meningitis Vaccine Project is one of the most successful vaccine PDPs. the vaccine was licensed in 2009 under the name MenAfriVac and earned prequalification status by the WHO in 2010. a broad coalition of international partners partnered to conduct pneumococcal vaccine trials using a conjugate vaccine containing nine of the pneumococcal serotypes most common in Gambia. findings indicated that vaccinating infants with pneumococcal vaccines could substantially reduce death and illness from pneumococcal infections. the decade of Vaccines GVAP does not outline a list of global vaccine R&D priorities in recognition that these priorities may be country-specific. however, the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research Strategic Plan (2010\u20132020) was developed to establish a global research agenda to guide the WHO and others in developing research priorities, standards, and guidelines. a TPP was established as part of the Advanced Market Commitment strategy employed in the development of PCV for use in Africa and Asia. 379 For example, a TPP was established as part of the Advanced Market Commitment strategy employed in the development of PCV for use in Africa and Asia. the vaccine was licensed in 2009 under the name MenAfriVac. it earned prequalification status by the WHO in 2010. 100 million doses of the vaccine were administered in 10 countries. NVAC recommendation 4.4: harmonizing regulatory standards to support global vaccine development The ASH should support efforts to strengthen international programs. the use of standardized tools and procedures can also strengthen the capabilities of existing regulatory authorities. the ICH developed a common technical document to harmonize the documentation needed for a new drug application among the three ICH regions. this platform saves both time and resources by providing a common electronic format for documenting and submitting technical data requirements. the common technical document also benefits regulatory agencies by facilitating the exchange of information during the review process. 27 manufacturers in 21 countries have achieved prequalification status. prequalification requires countries that manufacture prequalified vaccines to have a functional NRA in place that meets key performance indicators determined by a WHO assessment process. the african -Vaccine -Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) was established in 2006 as part of regional efforts to provide regulatory expertise and training to these countries. the forum's efforts are focused on promoting communication and collaboration among member countries. the international conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) was formed in 1990 as a collaboration between regulatory authorities and industry leaders in the u.s., Europe, and Japan. the ICH works to align technical requirements for reporting and evaluating data on quality, safety, and efficacy of new medicinal products. the ICH has developed standardized guidelines for a number of regulatory issues relevant to the evaluation of vaccine quality, safety, and efficacy. representatives from FDA/CBER participate as members on the ICH's Steering Committee. the ICH works closely with the ICH to promote regulatory harmonization. the african -Vaccine -Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) was established in 2006 as part of regional efforts to provide regulatory expertise and training to these countries. the AVAREF convenes biannually and includes representatives from the NRAs, ethics committees, and scientific advisory committees of 19 African countries. FDA/CBER supports the DCVRN through a recurring Foreign Regulators Seminar. the AVAREF provides technical support for implementing institutional review boards, attending annual meetings as expert advisors, conducting joint reviews and clinical trial site inspections, and training in adverse event monitoring. the DCVM Network consists of 38 members, eight of which are WHO prequalified. it is estimated that two-thirds of the world's children now receive at least one vaccine that was produced by a manufacturer in a developing country. the global action plan for influenza vaccines (GAP) was developed to address these concerns. the initiative facilitated the transfer of technology for influenza vaccine production to the DCVM Network through an innovative technology platform. participants could then use this technical knowledge to scale up production in their own facilities. workshops have been attended by more than 100 participants from more than 30 countries. they provide opportunities to build and strengthen partnerships that are necessary to create local, sustainable influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity. workshops have cultivated broad contextual and societal support necessary to sustain vaccine manufacturing. NIAID is working closely with academia and industry to explore the development of universal influenza vaccines based on highly conserved regions of the influenza virus. NIAID's comprehensive influenza research program enabled a rapid response when the H1N1 influenza pandemic began in 2009. the revised GAP II will include demand creation activities to complement the push mechanisms of direct assistance to manufacturers. CDC leverages its international surveillance collaborations and research portfolio to transform disease burden data into communications and cost-effectiveness data. a key strategy is the international Vaccine Donation Program, which allows low-income countries to receive vaccine and supplies. global community is leveraging the DCVM Network to increase vaccine manufacturing to maximize vaccine production capacity. global production capacity for seasonal influenza vaccines fell several billion doses below the number needed to protect the world in the event of a severe influenza pandemic. 90% of the world's population does not reside in countries with influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity and would most likely suffer from restricted access to the vaccine. 404 HHS leadership in ensuring global influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity for pandemic influenza preparedness. a number of HHS offices and agencies coordinate with the WHO to contribute to the GAP. these efforts also help advance U.S. strategies for national pandemic readiness. in 2011, BARDA collaborated with the WHO, Utah State University, and North Carolina State University to initiate a series of three-week training courses for DCVM to build core competencies in influenza vaccine production using cGMP. 408,409 Workshop participants are expected to use the information gained to implement influenza vaccine manufacturing and training of personnel within their own countries. NIAID is working closely with academia and industry to explore the development of universal influenza vaccines based on highly conserved regions of the influenza virus. such vaccines could obviate the need for annual reformulation and could be readily manufactured in the event of a pandemic. NVAC RECOMMENDATION 5: STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY FOR VACCINE DECISION MAKING Introducing new and underutilized vaccines into national vaccine programs. but the overall net benefits are often dependent on a country's ability to adequately plan for and finance new vaccines and new technologies prior to their implementation. improved data collection and information sharing at the country level will help better establish evidence baselines for disease burden, calculate predicted impact of vaccine introduction, and emphasize important safety signals and efficacy data expected in a given population. countries may now consider vaccine introductions on a wider set of criteria that include economic, logistical, and social factors. the ProVac Initiative has supported 24 analyses in 14 Latin American and Caribbean countries to implement the ProVac model in planning/forecasting their vaccine needs. the success has sparked an interest in other WHO member countries to expand this type of technical support to other LMICs. the Cold Chain Equipment Manager tool helps immunization programs in calculating storage capacity and managing vaccine-related equipment inventories. the tool can be used to determine equipment needs and help countries budget over time by calculating the financial and programmatic costs of procuring and maintaining program equipment requirements. NVAC recommendation 5.2: building vaccine decision-making capacity through expert technical advisory groups. support should include technical assistance and provisions to develop and train these national immunization technical advisory bodies. the WHO established the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) strong supporting evidence leads to strong WHO recommendations. recommendations may be used to guide aid programs, donor funding, and vaccine procurement priorities. decisions to introduce and implement new or underutilized vaccines into national immunization programs should ultimately occur at the country level. the PAHO ProVac Initiative works to assist PAHO member countries in conducting evaluations of their national immunization programs. technical support includes networking to academic ProVac Centers of Excellence (focused on decision science and policy research), regional training workshops, Web-based resources, direct technical support when requested. 437 SIVAC provides support and technical assistance to countries to strengthen and improve NITAG efforts. these indicators are intended to help evaluate the impact of expert advisory committees on national immunization programs. these indicators are intended to help evaluate the impact of expert advisory committees on national immunization programs, to better understand their effectiveness. the WHO has summarized the full scope of considerations in the 2005 guidance document. lack of access to this type of data is also cited as the biggest area of weakness in country-level decision making. the proVac Initiative has supported 24 analyses in 14 countries to implement the ProVac model in planning/forecasting their vaccine needs. the On-Line International Vaccine Economics and Statistics repository provides country-specific data on disease burden, population demographics, health-care use, health-care costs, and information related to vaccine coverage and immunization services. countries should also consider logistical factors and operational criteria that could be impacted by new vaccine introductions. in 2008, the WHO released guidance to countries for conducting economic evaluations of their immunization programs. this document is intended to standardize the approach to economic analyses so that data shared between countries is transparent, complete, and comparable. it emphasizes the need to present cost-effectiveness data in formats that are easily digestible by a range of immunization stakeholders and decision-making bodies. ASH should work with HHS offices and non-HHS partners to increase investments in national evidence-based decision making by NITAGs. support should include technical assistance and provisions to develop and train these national immunization technical advisory bodies. the capacity to develop evidence-based vaccine and immunization decision making varies among countries. in one study surveying WHO member countries in 2008, NITAGs were reported in 89 of 147 countries. the participation of country delegations in the ACIP meetings is facilitated by staff from the PAHO Washington, D.C. office and supported by the Sabin Vaccine Institute. related efforts are being conducted by the Supporting Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees Initiative. NVAC RECOMMENDATION 6: UNIFYING HHS GLOBAL IMMUNIZATION EFFORTS: LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATION The culture of HHS is shifting toward a more institutionalized coordination of global health work. global goals are now integrated into domestic goals. representatives from all HHS agencies serve on expert committees, advisory committees, and technical panels for the WHO. currently, more than 300 staff stationed in 75 countries in support of advancing global health. 440 staff has often seconded staff to multilateral organizations, USG departments, and global health organizations. HS should consider convening an HHS cross-departmental working group to create an HHS Global Immunizations Implementation Plan. this includes measurable outcomes defined by the HHS agencies, how the agencies will track progress toward these outcomes, and potential barriers to achieving the NVAC recommendations and other objectives described in Goal 5 of the NVP. 6.2.3. the HHS cross-departmental working group should develop an annual report to Congress on HHS investments and HHS impacts on global immunization efforts. better coordination of global immunization efforts within HHS would multiply impact. establishing a more institutionalized platform for coordination of activities can assist HHS in communicating its successes and global health service to leadership and the public. 440 staff from all HHS agencies serve on expert committees, advisory committees, and technical panels for the WHO. they often seconded staff to multilateral organizations, ministries of health, other USG departments, and global health organizations to accomplish critical global health work. these staff assignments range from short-term details to long-term assignments, all within the bounds of HHS-wide policies regarding staffing. an HHS cross-departmental working group should develop an annual report to Congress on HHS investments and HHS impacts on global immunization efforts. the ASH should emphasize all of the comprehensive efforts required to optimize disease prevention through vaccination. the ASH should also collaborate with USG agencies to understand how the whole of USG global immunization efforts are supporting implementation of the Decade of Vaccines GVAP. establishing a more institutionalized platform for coordination of activities can help HHS communicate its successes and global health service to leadership and the public. better coordination within HHS will also facilitate communicating about critical public health issues and departmental priorities, capabilities, and resources for global immunizations. the NVAC calls on the ASH to continue to make sure global immunizations remain at the forefront of HHS global health priorities. new HHS activities and collaborations should not adversely affect the funding or impede the progress of existing activities."}
