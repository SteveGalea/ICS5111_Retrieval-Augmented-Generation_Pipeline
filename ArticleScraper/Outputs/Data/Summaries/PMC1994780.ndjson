{"summary": "mass spectrometry-based approaches for genomic analysis have been based on direct detection of nucleic acids using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) MS analysis. however, MALDI TOF instrumentation is relatively expensive and sample preparation can be quite laborious. direct analysis of nucleic acids by ESI-MS still suffers from the same problems as MALDI TOF MS. mass spectrometry can also be used to detect nucleic acids indirectly through the use of cleavable mass tags. mass spectrometry can also be used to detect nucleic acids indirectly through the use of cleavable mass tags. we describe the synthesis of novel ESI-cleavable Tandem nucleic acid mass Tag\u2013peptide nucleic acid conjugates and their analysis by ESI-MS/MS. we demonstrate a novel mass tag cleavage method in which source voltages in the electrospray ionisation source are used to cleave an ESI-cleavable linker. this method allows for direct analysis of assay solutions without requiring complex workups to cle the ESI-cleavable TNT\u2013PNA conjugates consist of a PNA probe portion, which interacts with the immobilized target sequence (DNA or RNA) and a peptide tandem nucleic acid mass tag portion, which is ultimately detected. the ESI-cleavable linker connects the PNA probe portion of the conjugate to the tandem nucleic acid mass tag peptide. TNT parent tag ions are selected from background, fragmented by CID and finally, daughter, tag fragment ions from the fragmentation are detected. the signals are indeed due to the presence of tagged probes, thereby detecting the presence of target sequences. mass normalization group is essentially uncharged and comprises a second alanine mass modifier group to adjust the overall mass of the tag and a proline group. the ESI-cleavable linker is outlined by another black broken box and comprises an aspartic acid proline linkage. lanine was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc (Andover, MA) the sequences of the TNT peptides used for the preparation of ESI-cleavable TNT-PNA probes are shown in Table 1. the sequences and yields of the TNT-PNA probes are shown in Table 2.

Target sequences Target name Oligonucleotide sequence MOMP-50 Biotin-CAGACGCTGGCGTAGCAACAGCTACTGGAACATATCG-TNT2-COOH 1.5% Biotinylated, fully complementary target 50-mer oligo biotinylated target sequences were made up in stock solutions of 50 pmol/l in water. pre-hybridization ratio experiments Six aliquots of 20 l of stock solution of the first TNT-PNA probe was mixed with 20, 10, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5 l of the second TNT-PNA. the target solution was removed from the beads and the beads were washed twice with hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl) each aliquot of the first five aliquots of bead-captured target was then incubated with 50 l of a TNT-PNA probe solution comprising 2 nmol of the target but with the alternative TNT tag on the probe. aliquots of 125 l of myOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (10 mg/ml suspension) were separated from their storage buffer and washed with twice with 50:50 methanol:water to remove potential MS contaminants. the beads were then washed with 1 B&W buffer to remove potential MS contaminants. mass spectrometric analyses ESI-MS/MS spectra were obtained on a micromass Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass), Wythenshaw, UK. the TNT-PNA oligonucleotides were denatured from the Dynabeads into 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid. mass spectra were externally calibrated using manufacturer's standards and calibration protocols. each tag is linked to a PNA oligonucleotide probe by a second linker. the aspartic acid/proline linker is used to cleave the tags from their oligonucleotides during electrospray ionization of the tagged oligonucleotides. the expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the cleaved parent tag ions generated by dissociation of the aspartic acid/pro the number of tags that can be synthesized increases as the square of the number of mass modifier components. there are at least five isotopes of alanine with different masses that are commercially available which would actually allow the synthesis of 25 tags using the design presented here. the mass of the singly charged parent tag ion of TNT1 is 388.2. the mass of the singly charged parent tag ion of TNT2 is 387.2. both tags could be selected simultaneously by the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF. the whole molecular ions were selected using the first quadrupole of the instrument. they were then subjected to collision induced dissociation at different collision energies. fragmentation of the whole TNT\u2013PNA probe ions was carried out as it allows both the cleavage of the TNT parent tag from the PNA and the cleavage of the tag fragment from the parent tag. the tag fragment ion at m/z 216.1 and 219.2 is also released. only the 216.1 ion is annotated although the 219.2 is present at similar quantities if the spectra are zoomed. the tag fragment intensity are lower than those for the parent tag ions at 25 and 30 V as they cleave less easily. the 387.2 and 388.2 ions with the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument are subjected to CID in the second quadrupole followed by mass separation and detection in the TOF analyser. it can be seen that there is very little noise in the region of the spectrum where the tag fragment ions are detected. the ratios reflect the relative abundance of the TNT\u2013PNA conjugates during electrospray ionisation. sets of TNT isotopes should have almost identical behaviour in analytical separations (17) and during the ionization process. the ratios of the intensities of the TNT isotopomer fragments should reflect the ratios of the concentrations of the probes in solution or hybridized on their targets. concentration of the probe with the higher concentration ranged from approximately 6.6 pmol/l to 66 fmol/l. the expected ratios are conserved reasonably accurately over the dilution series, within a margin of about 10%. it can be seen that there are simple linear correlations between the expected and measured ratios. aliquots of a synthetic biotinylated 50-mer DNA oligonucleotide target was captured onto avidinated magnetic beads and hybridized with TNT-PNA probes with identical probe sequences but different tags. aliquots of beads were then washed extensively to remove probe that had not hybridized. negative controls in which the target was absent do not show significant binding of TNT\u2013PNA conjugates to the beads. this gives a clear indication that the probes behave quantitatively in hybridization assays and that TNT-PNA probes can be used for accurate quantification. probes of the same length were used together. after the hybridization, the magnetic beads were washed as before. the hybridized TNT-PNAs were eluted from their targets into 50:50 methanol:water with 1% formic acid and analysed as described earlier. each tag is linked to a PNA oligonucleotide probe by a second linker. aspartic acid/proline linker is used to cleave the tags from their oligonucleotides. the expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the tag fragment ions and the structures of the neutral mass normalizer fragments are shown in part (ii) of figure 2a and b (37). ucleotide synthesizer supports PNA synthesis (Expedite DNA/PNA synthesizer), allowing the completion of the synthesis of the probe. the completed probe was then cleaved from the resin and deprotected in one step (TFA/cresol) and then purified. with this approach, only one purification step is required resulting in better yield of finished probe than multi-stage processes. HMPA linker to the carboxylic acid group of the first amino acid to allow the peptide to be cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis. other resins will be tested in future to avoid the loss of isotope. the complete TNT-PNA probe molecules were initially ionized with the cone voltage set to minimize fragmentation. the whole molecular ions were selected using the first quadrupole of the instrument and were then subjected to collision induced dissociation at different collision energies. the whole TNT\u2013PNA probe conjugate ions were then subjected to collision induced dissociation at different collision energies. in this experiment, a mixture of two 12-mer TNT\u2013PNA conjugates have been analysed. it can be seen that as the collision energy is increased, the intensity of the TNT parent tag ions at m/z 387.3 and 388.3 also increases. the tag fragment ion at m/z 216.1 and 219.2 is also released. TNTs are cleaved from their conjugates in the ESI ion source using a cone voltage of 25 V followed by subsequent selection of the parent tag ions from background. these parent tag ions are subjected to CID in the second quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument followed by mass separation and detection in the TOF analyser. it can be seen that there is very little noise in the region of the spectrum where the tag fragment ions are detected. a key feature of the Tandem Nucleic acid mass Tag design is the ease with which large numbers of chemically identical, isotopomeric tags can be made. sets of TNT isotopes should have almost identical behaviour in analytical separations (17) and during the ionization process. this means that it should be possible to use these tags to accurately quantify their associated oligonucleotide sequences. the deviations are a mean of four replicates at each concentration. the concentration of the probe with the higher concentration ranged from approximately 6.6 pmol/l to 66 fmol/l. the expected ratios are conserved reasonably accurately over the dilution series. aliquots of a synthetic biotinylated 50-mer DNA oligonucleotide target was captured onto avidinated magnetic beads and hybridized with TNT-PNA probes with identical probe sequences but different tags. aliquots of beads were then washed extensively to remove probe that had not hybridized. the measured ratio matches very closely the expected ratio. negative controls in which the target was absent do not show significant binding of TNT\u2013PNA conjugates to the beads. this gives a clear indication that the probes behave quantitatively in hybridization assays. the measured TNT ratios show a linear relationship with the expected ratios. the measured quantities do not exactly match the expected ratios. these data suggest that quantitative internal calibration should be achievable. ii) PNA is approximately 15% lower in mass than a corresponding DNA sequence. a shorter probe can be used to achieve a corresponding level of specificity. the probes perform reliably over a wide dynamic range providing a new platform for multiplexing and quantitative genomic analysis. in future work, we will explore the use of this feature to enable in-line coupling of analytical separations such as capillary electrophoresis. sets of isotopic TNTs can be synthesized that behave identically during separations, hybridizations and labelling reactions. this means that multiplexed analyses with accurate quantification are now enabled in a user-friendly format."}
