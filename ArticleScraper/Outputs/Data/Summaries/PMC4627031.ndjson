{"summary": "the first MERS case in china was confirmed with human-to-human transmission in 2013. it is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered china\u2019s deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. previous cases have shown that medical students are at high risk of newly emerging diseases, including SARS. the study selected individuals to represent the 9000 medical students in Wannan medical college. a multi-stage, random cluster sampling design was used to designate study subjects. all students were divided into grades. Grades 3 and 4 were selected. each of the above randomly selected grades was divided into multiple majors. questionnaire was comprised of 18 items including demographics and knowledge about MERS in three areas: diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures. a knowledge score was calculated by giving +1 for the correct answer (Yes/No), and 0 for \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d with the highest possible score being 18. a chi-square test was performed to examine the distribution of continuous variables. 89.7 89.7 5.2 5.2 5.2 Transmission 4. MERS can spread through close contact with infected persons like those caring for each other and/or living together. 70.6 70.6 13.1 16.4 Diagnosis and treatment 6. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can be used to diagnose MERS. 63.3% 72.4% 81.2% 74.0% Total 55.7% 73.7% 78.9% 66.1% 4. Discussion Our study showed that medical students had good knowledge of MERS. nursing students had the lowest scores in comparison to the other majors. management students had relatively higher scores compared to the other majors. our study had several limitations. lacking the information about students\u2019 sources and accessibility. the difference of knowledge scores between students in different majors could be confounded by students\u2019 individual habits of accessing information from media."}
