{"summary": "infection causes significant financial losses through decreased production, increased vaccination and treatment cost, and increased mortality through interactions with bacterial and other viral infections (1\u20133) swine IAV is a significant zoonotic pathogen with public health relevance. insights into patterns of swine IAV genetic diversity allow identification of novel viral lineages, provide criteria for rational intervention in swine agriculture and facilitate public health pandemic preparedness. the third endemic swine IAV lineage resulted from repeated human seasonal IAVs spilling into swine herds and subsequent evolution in pigs. these viruses were first recognized in Europe in the 1990s (20), with independent introductions occurring in North American (21, 22) and South American (23) swine herds. a new, adaptable, universally acceptable nomenclature is needed to follow the dynamic evolution of swine IAV in a globally comprehensive context. this nomenclature should provide a common terminology for all regions and describe each of the contemporary virus clades in the context of its evolutionary history. a unified swine H1 nomenclature system was established to simplify terminology, remove the arbitrary association with geography, establish a rational system for identifying and designating future clades. a web-based annotation tool was developed to use the principles of the proposed nomenclature to assign cla. the tool places an HA/H1 sequence on a phylogeny of just a few representatives of each of the named clades and then infers a clade for the query sequence from its local environment in the phylogeny. classification by this web-based tool matched expertly curated, manual classification of the sequences >99% of the time. the best-known tree was generated using maximum likelihood methods from 7,070 H1 swine and representative human and avian hemagglutinin gene sequences. subsequently, the global tree was split into the three major lineages to facilitate presentation: 1A classical swine lineage (A), 1B human seasonal lineage (B), and 1C Eurasian avian lineage (C). branch color represents clade designations proposed in this study. the tree is midpoint rooted for clarity; all branch lengths are drawn to scale. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the 1A.1.1 clade was detected in Canada, the United States, and Taiwan. the 1A.3.2 clade was detected in Mexico and the united states. the 1A.3.3.3 viruses were isolated in south Korea and the united states. each clade had an APD of >7% from other clades. 1A.3.2 1A.3.3 1A.3.3.1 1A.3.3.2 1A.1 7.8 1A.1.1 9.5 11.5 1A.1.2 5.4 11.4 13.8 1A.1.3 3.0 8.3 11.8 10.1 1A.2 3.8 10.8 14.0 12.5 8.7 1A.3 4.2 10.8 13.7 12.2 8.7 10.6 1A.3.1 1.4 11.2 13.7 12.7 9.1 12.1 11.4 11.4 1A.3.2 5.3 11.1 1 1B.2.2.1 (n = 24) from Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Netherlands. 1B.1.2.2 (n = 21) from Italy;

all branch lengths are drawn to scale. some clades within the 1A lineage were geographically constrained. 1A.1.2 viruses were detected only in Thailand (n = 13); 1A.1.3, 1A.3.3, and 1A.3.3.1 were restricted to China and Hong Kong (n = 28); and 1A.3.1 was restricted to Mexico (n = 14). the remaining clades were more diffuse, potentially reflecting the dissemination of viruses with agricultural trade. the H1N1 pandemic viruses (1A.3.3.2) from North American \u201c-H1\u201d viruses (1A.3.3.3) and a geographically isolated clade of viruses from China (1A.3.3.1).

countries) (20), and 1B.2 viruses related to the \u201c-1 H1\u201d and \u201c-2 H1\u201d viruses (n = 1,315, 6 countries) (22). we defined two third-order 1B.1 clades: the 1B.1.1 (n = 24) viruses, circulating predominantly in the united kingdom, with one virus collected in France, and 1B.1.2 (n = 108) viruses circulating in continental Europe. the 1B human seasonal lineage within- and between-clade APDs are presented in Table 3. each clade had an APD of >7% from other clades. the within-clade exceptions were the 1B.1 and 1B.2 clades (APD, 9.9% and 7.5%, respectively) 5.1 12.1 11.8

sets. of the 7, 1 HA was incorrectly classified (i.e., 1A.2 virus was placed in the 1A.1.2 clade), 1 HA was incorrectly assigned to a lower-order division (1A.1) and the remaining 5 viruses were incorrectly assigned to a higher-order division (1A.3.3 classified to 1A the representative phylogeny used for classifying global swine sequences contained 239 H1 viruses of predominantly swine origin. the swine viruses were selected to capture the diversity within each of the defined clades. the classifier ascribed the correct clade in all but 41 instances. we identified 3 first-order lineages, 7 second-order divisions, 13 third-order divisions, and 8 fourth-order divisions that sufficiently capture the historical and current genetic diversity of global swine H1 HA influenza viruses. these criteria are flexible enough to adapt to continued within-clade evolution of viruses and allow for the identification and classification of novel lineages. our tool uses maximum likelihood to rapidly classify a query IAV sequence by placing it on a reference phylogeny of just 239 H1 viruses selected from the named, biologically informative clades. when a query sequence does not fall within a named clade, it is classified by the neighborhood of its placement, using a \u201c-like\u201d annotation. our goal of achieving tightly structured definitions for statistically supported clades was challenged by the relatively frequent introduction of avian and human IAVs to swine populations. another challenge was the forced inclusion of viruses with likely specific regional evolutionary histories into a geographically broader classification because of the paucity of sequences from that region. despite this challenge, our classification system can identify regional patterns of genetic diversity. if the widely dispersed 1A.3.3.2 viruses are excluded, 84% of the publicly available swine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present belonged to 6 predominant clades. swine IAV hemagglutinin (HA) H1 sequences from viruses in the IRD (30) were downloaded on 7 June 2016. only H1N1 and H1N2 subtype viruses were included. sequences with 100% identity were removed. an additional 428 randomly sampled human seasonal H1 HA sequences and 344 randomly sampled avian H1 HA sequences were also included with the swine IAV, resulting in a final data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences. a maximum likelihood tree was inferred using RAxML (v8.2.4 [54] on the CIPRES Science Gateway (55) using the rapid bootstrap algorithm. in Results, we created three separate data sets by separating the 6,298 swine H1 sequences into the three first-order lineages and randomly subsampling viruses from each second-order division. the first data set contained 750 sequences from the 1A lineage (classical swine lineage), the second data set contained 1,018 sequences from the 1B lineage (human seasonal lineage) and the third data set contained 760 sequences from the 1C lineage (Eura the H1 gene classification tool is based on a tree inferred using maximum likelihood from 3 to 10 representatives of each well-supported, named clade. an H1 sequence was required to be at least 1,600 nucleotides (nt) long but was unrestricted with respect to host species. the tree of representative sequences acts as a \u201cscaffold\u201d upon which the query sequence is placed. all available swine IAV hemagglutinin (HA) H1 sequences from viruses in the IRD (30) were downloaded on 7 June 2016. only H1N1 and H1N2 subtype viruses were included, and these sequences comprised 8,438 worldwide samples. phylogenetic methods, clade annotation, and clade comparisons were also included with the swine IAV. a maximum likelihood tree was inferred using RAxML (v8.2.4 [54] on the CIPRES Science Gateway (55). to validate tree topology, branch support, and the subsequent manual clade designations, we created three separate data sets by separating the 6,298 swine H1 sequences into the three first-order lineages. the first data set contained 750 sequences from the 1A lineage (classical swine lineage), the second data set contained 1,018 sequences from the 1B lineage (human seasonal lineage), and the third data set contained 760 sequences from the 1C lineage classifier uses pplacer (60) to attach a query sequence to a branch in this tree. pplacer maximizes the likelihood of the placement by comparing the sequence of the query with the sequences in the tree. if the query is attached to a terminal branch, then it is assigned the clade of the virus at the basal end of this branch. sequences to distinguish new pandemic 2009 H1 viruses from earlier seasonal H1 viruses in humans and other hosts."}
