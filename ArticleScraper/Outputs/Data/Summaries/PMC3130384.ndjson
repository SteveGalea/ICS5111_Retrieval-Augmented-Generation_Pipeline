{"summary": "the first kind is to do with the risk that an exotic or novel infection will appear in a given host population. this risk has been formally estimated for, for example, rabies or foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) being introduced into the UK [1,2] the second kind is that, given an infectious disease is present, how fast will it spread, how many people or animals will be affected. the biggest risk factor for acquiring an infection is the presence of infectious individuals, which introduces positive feedback into epidemic processes. this makes the expected trajectory of an epidemic more difficult to predict than is the case for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer or obesity. a cross-sectional study could generate a positive or zero correlation between levels of disease and control effort as easily as a negative one. the first example (figure 1a) illustrates the simple but important observation that decreasing the transmission rate (achieved, for example, by more rapid quarantining of cases) does, as might be expected, reduce the size of an outbreak but may increase rather than decrease the duration of the outbreak. this is a well-known paradox that applies in other contexts too. but misinterpretations persist, e.g. of the effectiveness of control by pre-emptive culling during the UK FMD 2001 epidemic. changes to location, size and species composition of livestock farms would be readily incorporated into a new model. this would be the case if, for example, a different strain of FMD virus was introduced, perhaps with different transmission characteristics. this would be the case if farming practices had altered in ways, such as improvements in biosecurity, which changed FMD transmission rates. climate change was much more of a concern for infectious diseases in africa than in the UK, and for 2030 rather than 2015. economic and social factors were seen as much more important drivers for human infectious disease risk in Africa than in the UK. there are many thousands of studies of the latter but far less attention has been paid to the latter. a risk profile or risk map is thus generated which can be used for direct surveillance, prevention or control efforts. colour scale shows the relative risk of secondary cases if FMD were present in the \u2018at risk\u2019 farms, as derived from an analysis of risk factors using data from the UK 2001 FMD epidemic. risk modelling is defined as the formal, quantitative estimation of the probability of specified adverse effects from defined hazards [15]. animal diseases has used stochastic, individual-based models (IBMs) this approach has a number of advantages: \u2014 individuals are represented explicitly and their infection status can be tracked; \u2014 heterogeneities between individuals can be represented directly and non-parametrically; \u2014 complex individual histories can be incorporated in a fully realistic manner. a logistic regression model and a previously published IBM-based analysis performed slightly better using this measure. another study compared statistical risk factor analysis and stochastic simulation models fitted using maximum-likelihood methods. the two approaches agreed well in terms of identifying which risk factors were important and which farms were at most risk of infection. the risks of individuals becoming infected are dynamic and not independent of one another. this introduces spatial and temporal autocorrelations that may be difficult to account for. this problem is exacerbated when the intention is to predict future risks. the sample size available is not the total population but the infected population. the outputs of a risk factor analysis are routinely expressed in terms of odds ratios associated with each of the risk factors in the model. a risk profile or risk map is thus generated which can be used for direct surveillance, prevention or control efforts. a significant challenge to risk modellers is accurate communication of the results. it is now widely accepted that formal measures of uncertainty must be linked to the \u2018headline\u2019 result. deterministic differential equation models were the foundation of epidemiological modelling for almost a century. model validation is demonstration that the model accurately represents the developer's conceptual description and specifications, i.e. that it does what it is supposed to do. verification means simply that the model achieves pre-set performance requirements, i.e. that it is fit for purpose. s required to make predictions about future disease risks can usefully be divided into those concerning the disease, the host or the environment. there is an asymmetry in research effort, here between studies addressing pathogenesis (how the pathogen affects the host and vice versa) and studies addressing transmission of the pathogen. ography is an essential component of any epidemiological analysis. key demographic variables typically include the age and sex structure of the population and its density and spatial distribution. a key issue for disease spread is patterns of host movement. in 2001, the disease reached areas of high livestock densities, resulting in a major epidemic. in 2007, it remained confined to low-density areas and spread was, as predicted at the time, limited. a common confounding issue is the involvement of additional host populations, whether they reservoirs of infection. these events are extremely hard to \u2018predict\u2019, in contrast to the way that climate change is predicted. but may well turn out to have considerably greater epidemiological consequences over the next few decades. disease prevention programmes and/or reactive control efforts are key \u2018environmental\u2019 drivers of the dynamics of many infections. surveillance data describing distribution and spread of infection through space and time. under-reporting is a major problem for diseases such as human influenza or sheep scrapie. under-reporting is a major problem for diseases such as human influenza or sheep scrapie. the availability of high-quality movement data makes it much easier to identify movement as a risk factor, but for some infections, such as E. coli O157, other, harder-to-quantify factors may be of much greater epidemiological significance. migratory patterns have been used as inputs into risk analysis, for example, for the spread of avian influenza by wildfowl. 'environment' is taken to refer to any factor that is not an attribute of the pathogen or the host(s) this encompasses a vast range of possible influences on disease dynamics. examples include associations of climate-related factors with outbreaks of African horse sickness [44], cholera [45] and Rift Valley fever [46] or shifts in endemic levels of malaria infection [47]. some types of intervention are relatively easy to quantify and evaluate. examples include the impact of vaccination programmes and the role of herd immunity [49], or the impact of culling for the control of animal diseases [50]. another difficulty is knowing how control measures are applied in practice. the main challenge was fully accounting for highly suspect reporting patterns. fully one-third of all reported events occurring in the u.s. and very few in countries such as china, india, the Philippines or Mexico. possible examples include the origins of HIV-1, BSE, SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza A and Nipah virus. challenge is to move beyond statements that may well be correct but have little practical value, such as \u2018new pathogens will emerge\u2019. a recent guide to good practice for quantitative analysis of epidemiological data is intended to be helpful to users of the outputs. the kinds of issues addressed include clarity of objectives, transparency, good documentation and record keeping, verification, validation, the role of peer review and audit, reproducibility, and clear and accurate communication of outputs, assumptions and uncertainties. the application of quantitative methods to predict future infectious disease risks has become more sophisticated and more widely accepted in recent years. the application of formal, quantitative methods to predict future infectious disease risks has become more sophisticated and more widely accepted."}
