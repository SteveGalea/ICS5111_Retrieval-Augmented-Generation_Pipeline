{"summary": "the classification of papillomaviruses (PVs) has been based on L1 gene sequence. they are clinically divided into two groups: low-risk HPVs, like HPV 6 and 11, which cause benign lesions (warts and benign papillomas) and high-risk HPVs (hrHPVs), like HPV16 and 18, which are carcinogenic to humans. early and late regions encode six early genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and two late genes (L1 and L2). early and late regions encode six early genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and two late genes (L1 and L2). they can interfere in several cell cycle pathways, especially the alteration of EGFR signaling pathways [15, 16], degradation of p53 [17] and degradation of pRB [18], respectively. HLA genes are the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. many of HLA-I alleles can be classified by their similar peptide-binding properties into groups, covering over 80% of HLA-A and B alleles. the binding of a peptide to a peptide-MHC complex is the most selective stage in the way of peptide presentation [55]. bioinformatics tools can predict the potential immunogenic epitopes from thousands of epitopes in a short time [56]. plan was designed to identify the most probable epitopes of hrHPV oncoproteins. for the first step, MHC-I binding, MHC-I processing, MHC-I population coverage and MHC-I immunogenicity prediction analyses were considered. the second step analyses were performed only for selected peptides in the first step. the used human and mouse alleles, or allele groups, are provided in supporting information (S1 Table). the used human and mouse alleles, or allele groups are provided in supporting information (S1 Table). the PR is calculated by comparing the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of subjected peptide against a group of random peptides from Swiss-Prot database. no known T cell epitope has got an IC50 value >5000nM to date. Rankpep MHC-I binding prediction Rankpep predicts binder peptides of a given protein sequence or sequence alignments to MHC-I and II molecules. it uses profiles of aligned peptides recognized to bind to a specific MHC molecule and creates a consensus sequence by determining the most common residue for each position. the server did not provide all common lengths of epitopes for all the MHC alleles. the maximum score could vary between different MHC alleles. the prediction was made against 26 frequently occurring HLA-I alleles. epitope length was set on 8, 9, 10, and 11mer. the prediction was made against 35 human alleles (IEDB reference set) and three mouse alleles. each IEDB-recommended method participated in the prediction process offered a core Peptide (9mer) for each predicted epitope (15mer) the immunoproteasomes are believed to improve the efficiency of antigen presentation. in this study, the immunoproteasome option was selected. the program outputs for every predicted epitope consisted of proteasome score, TAP score, MHC score, processing score, and MHC-I IC50. this tool uses the properties of amino acids and their locations to predict the immunogenicity of a pMHC. the default option was selected to specify which positions of the query peptide to be masked from the analysis. it can accept a target population by two query levels: 1) area-country-ethnicity and 2) ethnicity alone. Fig 3 shows the pipeline of CABS-dock protocol [88, 89]. Fig 3 shows the pipeline of CABS-dock protocol. the fully automated procedure involves multiple programs. the best model, which has the highest CD value, is not necessarily the top-ranked model, because, in some cases, peptides were not. the best model, which has the highest CD value, is not necessarily the top-ranked model. the equal CD value of each model was multiplied by its allele population coverage. the sum of all HLA-I or II weighted indexes of each peptide was calculated to get a total docking score (TDS) it is the first time that the TDS has been formulated and used for this purpose. the inter-hrHPVs conservancy analysis was done by the IEDB and ExPASy ClustalW servers. cross-reactivity with host antigens can cause adverse immune responses. the selected peptides in the first step were checked for similarities with the mouse and human proteomes. isoform sequences of HPV16, 18, 31, and 45 oncoproteins were retrieved from HPV T cell Antigen Database (http://cvc.dfci.harvard.edu/hpv/HTML/search.php) all the sequences are accessible in supporting information. peptides with IC50 values 50nM are considered high affinity, 50-500nM intermediate affinity and more than 500-5000nM low affinity. peptides with IC50 values 50nM are considered as high affinity, 50-500nM intermediate affinity and more than 500-5000nM low affinity. HCpan4 server predicts binding of peptides to the known MHC molecules. it is trained on a combination of naturally eluted ligands (55 human and mouse alleles) and binding affinity data (172 MHC molecules from human, mouse, cattle, primates, and swine) SYFPEITHI MHC-I binding prediction is a database of over 7000 published and verified peptide sequences of human, mouse, and other organisms. it allocates the value 1 to those residues which slightly preferred in that particular position, 15 to the Ideal anchor residues, and -1 to -3 to those residues which exhibit an adverse effect on the binding ability. the maximum score could vary between different MHC alleles. Rankpep MHC-I binding prediction Rankpep predicts binder peptides of a given protein sequence or sequence alignments to MHC-I and II molecules. the server did not provide all common lengths of epitopes for all the MHC alleles. prediction was made against 26 frequently occurring HLA-I alleles and 5 H2-I alleles. epitope length was set on 8, 9, 10, and 11mer. IEDB MHC-II binding prediction In this study, the MHC-II binding prediction was made by IEDB MHC-II binding predictor [60, 63, 64]. the prediction was made against 35 human alleles (IEDB reference set) and three mouse alleles. the prediction was made against 35 human alleles and three mouse alleles. the server has fundamentally set the epitope length on 15mer. each IEDB-recommended method participated in the prediction process offered a core Peptide (9mer) for each predicted epitope (15mer) roteasomes are believed to improve the efficiency of antigen presentation. the program outputs for every predicted epitope consisted of proteasome score, TAP score, MHC score, processing score, and MHC-I IC50. the higher TAP score, the higher transport rate. population coverage prediction tool is used to predict the HLA-I population coverage of all 8-11mer predicted epitopes in the first step. the tool can accept a target population by two query levels: 1) area-country-ethnicity and 2) ethnicity alone. the fully automated CABS-dock procedure contains four main stages. CABS-dock gets the 3D structure of the receptor and the sequence of the peptide as obligatory inputs. also, there are some non-obligatory inputs as recommendations. 5IVX H-2-IAd 2IAD HLA-A*01:01 4NQV HLA-DRB1*04:01 5LAX H-2-Kb 4PV9 H-2-Ag7 1ESO HLA-A*03:01 3RL2 HLA-DRB1*11:01 6CPL H-2-Kd 5GSV H-2-IEk 1FNG HLA-B*07:02 5EO1 HLA-DRB5* the first time that the TDS has been formulated and used for this purpose. the use of highly conserved epitopes in a vaccine formulation reduces the risk of tumor immune escape. cross-reactivity with host antigens Cross-reactivity with host antigens can cause adverse immune responses. the selected peptides in the first step were checked for similarities with the mouse and human proteomes. this inconsistency indicates that these results needed to be analyzed with an integrated approach. population coverage determines coverage of a given peptide in the target population. second, it is the best index for summarizing and evaluating the HLA-I binding predictions. ten peptides from each HPV genotype oncoprotein (120 peptides in total) were selected for the second step analyses.

Feltkamp et al. recognized the HPV16-E7 sequence RAHYNIVTF as an MHC-I epitope that can provoke CTL-mediated responses. this sequence is the first HPV16-E7 predicted epitope in our study as well. they have screened 11 potent epitopes according to PR and immunogenicity score. the BIMAS algorithm [108] was employed to rank probable binding peptides according to the predicted one-time dissociation of pMHCs. three potential CTL predicted epitopes of the E6 protein (KLPQLCTEL, KISEYRHYC, and QQYNKPLCDL) and three of the E7 protein (YMLDLQPET, TLHEYMLDL, and RTLEDLLMGT) were selected. in a laborious in silico study for epitope prediction, E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins of hrHPV16, 18, 31 and 45 have been investigated altogether. previous in vivo studies have been conducted using SLPs of hrHPV-E6 and/or\u2013E7 oncoproteins, in particular HPV16 oncoproteins. polyepitope constructions including E5, E6 and E7 epitopes, the expansion of the minimal CTL epitopes to longer peptides (SLPs) it is important that improper vaccine design and immunosuppressive microenvironment were known as the main reasons of the failure in cancer immunotherapy by therapeutic cancer vaccines [134]. 212.2KB, zip)"}
