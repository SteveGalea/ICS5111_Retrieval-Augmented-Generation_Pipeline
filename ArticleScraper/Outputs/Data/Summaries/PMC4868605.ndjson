{"summary": "surrogate exposure studies compared N95 respirators and surgical masks for the prevention of transmissible acute respiratory infections were summarized separately. outcomes from clinical studies were laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness and workplace absenteeism. study selection Randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case\u2013control studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. a detailed protocol developed a priori is described in appendix 1. study designs assessed the use of national institute for Occupational safety and health certified N95 respirators compared with surgical masks. the term \u201csurgical mask\u201d was considered equivalent to medical masks, procedural masks, isolation masks, laser masks, fluid-resistant masks and face masks. randomized controlled trials were explicitly assessed for bias. the quality of evidence can be graded as high, moderate, low or very low. data synthesis Where data could be combined for meta-analyses, these data were reported as odds ratios. a 2 value less than 0.10 or an I2 value greater than 50% indicated significant heterogeneity. subgroup analysis was planned if there were more than 5 pooled studies. study designs assessed the use of national institute for Occupational Safety and Health certified N95 respirators compared with surgical masks. the term'surgical mask' was considered equivalent to medical masks, procedural masks, isolation masks, laser masks, fluid-resistant masks and face masks. randomized controlled trials were explicitly assessed for bias. the quality of evidence can be graded as high, moderate, low or very low. the quality of evidence can be graded as high, moderate, low or very low. all statistical analyses were performed with the use of RevMan (version 5.2; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). results Search results and study characteristics We selected 31 eligible articles involving 29 studies; 6 were clinical studies that we included in the meta-analysis. targeted use, fit-tested N95 respirator Control: targeted use, surgical mask Noninferiority trial Detection of influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus\u2013enterovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus. cluster randomization by hospital Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness 5-wk follow-up Intervention 1: continual use, fit-tested N95 respirator 43 nurses reported exposures and consistent use of facial protective equipment Detection of SARS Case\u2013control studies Seto et al., 200316 5 hospitals in Hong Kong: emergency departments and medicine units 13 infected (cases) and 241 noninfected (controls) nurses, doctors, health care assistants and domestic staff Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection N95 respirator Surgical mask Paper mask No cases in N95 respirator or surgical mask groups 143 controls wore either surgical mask or surgical mask similar results were found in 2 post-hoc meta-analyses. in one, we combined data from the 3 observational studies. in the other, we pooled data from all studies as an intellectual exercise. cohort study15 received a rating of 6 stars, one of the case\u2013control studies received 3 stars,16 and the other case\u2013control study received 6 stars. outcome-specific quality of evidence The ratings of importance and outcome-specific quality of evidence that we assessed using the GRADE approach are summarized in Table S13 of Appendix 1. no unpublished abstracts of RCTs, cohort studies or case\u2013control studies were found. we included 3 RCTs, 1 cohort study and 2 case\u2013control studies in the meta-analysis. cluster randomization by hospital Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness 5-wk follow-up Intervention 1: continual use, fit-tested N95 respirator Intervention 2: continual use, surgical mask Detection of influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus\u2013enterovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae. noninfected (controls) nurses, doctors, health care assistants and domestic staff wore either surgical mask or surgical mask. 143 controls wore either surgical mask or N95 respirator Detection of SARS. results of meta-analysis to determine effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers against acute respiratory infection. outcomes were (A) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (B) influenza-like illness and (C) workplace absenteeism. laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection was deemed an important outcome for decision-making with very-low-quality evidence from RCTs. work-related absenteeism was considered not an important outcome for decision-making with very-low-quality evidence from 1 RCT. sensitivity analyses could be performed because too few studies were included. the face seal is important for the efficiency of the N95 respirator. improper wearing or adjustment of the respirator because of discomfort could lead to inadvertent face contamination. we do not have an adequate understanding of the number, size and dispersion of the droplets that contain infectious viral particles. only 2 respiratory virus seasons were assessed by the 3 RCTs. in one trial,14 the peak period of one of these influenza seasons was missed. in another trial,11 the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 halted the study during the other respiratory season. no studies included in the meta-analysis independently audited compliance with the intervention. potential confounding due to concurrent interventions were not accounted for by our meta-analysis. a meta-analysis showed that there were insufficient data to determine definitively whether N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks in protecting health care workers against transmissible acute respiratory infections in clinical settings."}
