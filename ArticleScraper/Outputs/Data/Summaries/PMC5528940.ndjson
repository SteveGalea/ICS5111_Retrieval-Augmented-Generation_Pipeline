{"summary": "cowpox is a member of Orthopoxviridae family and is endemic in northern Europe and western areas of the Soviet Union. cowpox is the best described and most commonly encountered poxvirus infection of cats. treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infection and recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-) to modulate the immune response. antiviral drugs, such as famciclovir, commonly used for the treatment of feline herpesvirus disease in cats, could also be considered. laryngeal examination identified laryngeal oedema with normal function. cat was discharged with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid. no other abnormalities were found on physical examination. a year after diagnosis, the cat was clinically well with no further episodes of stridor or dysphonia. the cat had a history of focal superficial ulceration with associated oedema and swelling of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the caudal mammary region. a further 2 days later, the area of ulceration affecting the ventral abdomen had progressed to a necrotic eschar. there were also multiple small raised nodules surrounding the central necrotic area, and crusting papules and nodules around the head and neck. the following day, 7 days after initial presentation, biopsies of the affected areas were taken. cat re-presented on day 12, with its appetite having reduced. cat was given intravenous rFeIFN- (as above) for a further 3 days. by day 14, de novo nodular lesions had developed on the neck, head and thoracic limbs. the lungs had multifocal areas of consolidation, with small quantities of white foam within the terminal bronchi. the pericardium was thickened with a moderately increased amount of pericardial fluid. eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found within the cytoplasm of the microglia (arrows) oropharyngeal and laryngeal examination identified laryngeal oedema with normal function. cat was discharged with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (Clavaseptin) 15 mg/kg PO q12h. no other abnormalities were found on physical examination. rFeIFN- (Virbagen Omega; Virbac [1 MU/kg SC q24h for 3 days)), prednisolone (Prednicare [Animal Care] 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h), marbofloxacin (Marbocyl [Vetoquinol] 2 mg/kg IV q24h) and famciclovir (Famvir [Novartis] 62.5 mg PO q12h a further 2 days later, the area of ulceration affecting the ventral abdomen had progressed to a necrotic eschar. there were also multiple small raised nodules surrounding the central necrotic area, and crusting papules and nodules around the head and neck. the following day, 7 days after initial presentation, biopsies of the affected areas were taken. the cat re-presented on day 12 with its appetite having reduced. the cat was given intravenous rFeIFN- (as above) for a further 3 days. by day 14, de novo nodular lesions had developed on the neck, head and thoracic limbs. the lungs had multifocal areas of consolidation, with small quantities of white foam within the terminal bronchi. there was marked microgliosis of all areas, with many having abundant cytoplasm within them. eosinophilic inclusion bodies found within the cytoplasm of the microglia (arrows), consistent with CPxV infection. CPxV infection should remain a differential diagnosis in cats with neurological signs, particularly if accompanied with dermatological and/or respiratory involvement. only case 2 presented with significant cutaneous pathology. it is essential that CPxV is considered as a differential diagnosis. authors became aware of an increase in prevalence of CPxV in the uk. this is the first case series to describe laryngeal and neurological CPxV infections in the domestic cat. this is the first case series to describe laryngeal and neurological CPxV infections in the domestic cat."}
