{"summary": "27 countries have reported 2,254 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS. there were 186 cases including 38 deaths, which is the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula. there were no additional MERS cases in Korea until August 2018. the patient was transferred to the government-designated isolation unit in our hospital on September 8 (day 11) he immediately suspected he had a MERS-CoV infection and reported to the health authority. blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature were 148/50 mmHg, 55/min, 20/min, and 37.2\u00b0C. he complained of diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, general weakness, and blood-tinged sputum. qRT-PCR analysis of his sputum confirmed MERS-CoV infection. nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and sputum samples performed on September 14 and 15 (days 17 and 18) were all negative, the patient was removed from isolation on September 18 (day 21) he was discharged on September 22 (day 25). a phylogenetic study of MERS-CoV from this patient may shed light on the origin of the infecting virus. he already had mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia on day 7 and extensive bilateral lung infiltrates on day 10. he visited a local health clinic two times (days 7 and 9 of his illness), and diarrhea was a presenting symptom. a recent study using an ex vivo human intestine model showed that MERS-CoV replicated better in intestinal epithelium than in respiratory epithelium. in our patient, however, we were not able to detect MERS-CoV RNA in his stool samples. the computed tomography scan showed a 5 cm-sized consolidation in the left lung. the present record highlights early detection of a MERS-CoV case is challenging. the present case highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion of MERS-CoV infection when a febrile patient presents."}
