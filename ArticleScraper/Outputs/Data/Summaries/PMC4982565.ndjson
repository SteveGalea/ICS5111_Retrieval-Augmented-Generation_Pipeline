{"summary": "three months before presentation the dog noticed a 3-cm diameter mass in the interscapular region. the dog had a history of injections in this area, including subcutaneous fluids for symptomatic therapy for gastrointestinal signs 1 year earlier and vaccinations 1 to 6 years prior to presentation. the dog was treated with amikacin (Amikacin; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA), 15 mg/kg body weight (BW), IV, q24h for 5 d. a second culture showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus sp. a complete blood (cell) count (CBC) and serum biochemistry performed a few days prior to presentation were normal. the dog was presented to VTH-CSU for restaging with a positron emission tomography-computed tomography. no clinical abnormalities were identified on physical examination. dog was induced with propofol (Propoflo; Abbott Labs, North Chicago, Illinois, USA), 4 mg/kg BW, IV, and midazolam (Midazolam hydrochloride; Hospira), 0.2 mg/kg BW, IV. he was transported to the PET/CT scanner, where 3.77 mCi 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) was injected the dog was sedated with medetomidine HCl (Domitor; Zoetis), 0.001 mg/kg BW, IV, and butorphanol tartrate. thoracic CT revealed a small increase in size of the soft tissue nodule in the right caudal lung lobe. thoracic CT abnormalities included a small increase in size of the right caudal lung lobe nodule (27 mm versus 21.2 mm) but no other changes of pulmonary soft tissue nodule size or interscapular previous surgical site appearance. a decision was made to continue with the toceranib and cyclophosphamide treatment, given these were well-tolerated by the dog. the dog was presented to VTH-CSU for restaging following development of inappetence, right hind limb pain and lameness. the dog was anesthetized and a PET/CT was performed using the previously described protocols. the tibial lesion was associated with a mild intramedullary trabecular lysis and was partially demarcated by a poorly defined sclerotic rim. this lesion was consistent with osteosarcoma bone metastasis. the toceranib and cyclophosphamide were discontinued. the dog was presented to VTH-CSU 2 mo after the radiation therapy (20 mo after EOS diagnosis) for worsening right hind limb lameness and pain. a few weeks after starting the masitinib, proteinuria was detected. the dog was non-weight bearing lame on the right hind limb. firm swelling was palpated around the right proximal tibia. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were normal. no other clinical abnormalities were present. osteosarcoma of extraskeletal sites is associated with a high rate of metastasis (57% and 64%) (2,7) monitoring for metastases (restaging) is indicated following treatment of osteosarcoma. thoracic CT has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of pulmonary metastases for appendicular osteosarcoma. a suspected right tibial bone metastasis assisted in monitoring of metastatic lesions. it is possible that the infection that developed following surgery in this dog may have contributed to the prolonged survival experienced. improved survival has been documented in dogs and in humans with osteosarcoma who developed infection after limb-sparing surgery. nomic cyclophosphamide has not been evaluated specifically as a treatment for osteosarcoma metastasis but has been used in combination with IV chemotherapy for canine osteosarcoma. this dog developed bone metastases later in the course of disease that were treated with coarsely fractionated, palliative radiation therapy to decrease pain associated with the bone lesion in the right proximal tibia."}
