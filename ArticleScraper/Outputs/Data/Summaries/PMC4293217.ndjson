{"summary": "crimean\u2013congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of the hemorrhagic fever, which was first described in Cremia in 1945. the virus consists of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA, and its tripartite genome comprises the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. the development of a vaccine or antiviral drug against CCHFV is very difficult. bioinformatics can assist in designing new vaccines through the identification of potential T-cell epitope, B-cell epitope, and human leukocyte antigen ligands. a Web-based server,30 was used for the prediction of the T-cell epitope. the epitope prediction was restricted to 12 MHC-I supertypes. the threshold for epitope identification was set at 0.5 to maintain sensitivity and specificity. IEDB-AR hosts a number of Web-based tools for the prediction of B-cell epitope. multiple tools, including the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, were used for the prediction with high accuracy. bioEdit v7.2.3 sequence alignment editor27 was used for the identification of the conserved region among the sequences through multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) with ClustalW.28 Finally, Jalview v2 tool29 was used to retrieve the alignment and the CLC Sequence Viewer v7.0.2 (http://www.clcbio.com) was used for analysis of the divergence among the different strains of the CCHFV. rix Method36 was used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of peptide binding to MHC-I molecules from different prediction methods. we used specific peptides for the prediction of MHC-I interaction on the basis of the antigenic conservancy and MHC-I analysis. a web-based tool from IEDB-AR48 was used to identify the specific conservancy of the proposed epitopes. 80 envelope glycoproteins and 34 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L molecules from different variants of the CCHFV were retrieved from the UniProt database. d peptides (MSA number: 3,563\u20133,658 and 3,694\u20133,773) were selected for further analysis. the peptide with second-best VaxiJen score (MSA: 3,694\u20133,773) showed better results. netCTL v1.2 server predicted the T-cell epitopes through the combined approach for the 12 MHC-I supertypes. five epitopes with top scores were selected for further analysis. CTLPred server also predicted the T-cell epitopes based on an approach that combined artificial neural networks and support vector machines. the output of the MHC-I interaction analysis is also shown in Table 4.

MHC-I and MHC-I interaction of the proposed sequence by IEDB-AR Epitope MHC interaction MHC interaction analysis DCSSTPPDR HLA-C*12:03, HLA-C*03:03, HLA-C*14:02, HLA-B*58:01, HLA-C*12:03, HLA-C*15:02, HLA-B*57 antigenic property of the peptides was assessed using the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale. the average antigenic propensity score of the protein was 1.019, with a maximum of 1.197 and a minimum of 0.884. the region from 197 to 202 is the proposed epitope. the X- and Y-axes represent the sequence position and antigenic propensity score. the threshold value is 1.0. the regions above the threshold are antigenic, shown in yellow. protein variability server predicted the variability of the conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L. the proposed epitope lies outside (197\u2013202) of the disordered region to secure its potentiality as an effective epitope. e conservancy analysis Peptide sequence Peptide length Percentage of protein sequence match Maximum identity DCSSTPPDR 9 100% (34/34) 100% FIACADCSSTPPDRW 15 100% (34/34) 100% Analysis of the retrieved sequences and their divergence A total of 80 envelope glycoproteins and 34 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L molecules from different variants of the CCHFV were retrieved from the UniProt database. the peptide with second-best VaxiJen score (MSA: 3,694\u20133,773) showed better results during further analysis of T-cell epitope identification, MHC interaction analysis, and B-cell epitope identification. netCTL v1.2 server predicted the T-cell epitopes through the combined approach for the 12 MHC-I supertypes. on the basis of the combined score, five epitopes with top scores were selected for further analysis.
