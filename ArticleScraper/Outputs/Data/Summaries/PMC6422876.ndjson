{"summary": "the worldwide camel population is 35 million heads (FAO, 2019) most of the camels are in Somalia, Sudan, Niger, Kenya, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, and Pakistan. dromedary camels compose about 95% of the population (Bornstein and Younan, 2013) camels are multipurpose animals used for milk and meat production, hair/felt, racing, transportation, and tourism. they also produce less methane on the basis of body mass index. milk contains between 3 and 10 times more vitamin C than cows' milk. a number of camel intensive dairy farms have been established worldwide. there is a slow but steady integration of camels' products into national and global economies. to utilize camels' potential, they need to undergo genetic improvement. heritability estimates of body weight and growth rates were moderate to high, 0.24\u20130.40, respectively. heritability estimates for birth weight were 0.37 and that of average daily gain ranged between 0.25 and 0.49. otide polymorphism (SNPs) on a large reference population with phenotypic information are thus most likely to be adopted in camel genetic improvement especially because camels are not traditionally pedigreed. GS is specifically recommended for camels due to their long generation intervals and can accelerate the rate of genetic gain compared to conventional selection schemes. the different farms in the united arab emirates can be the starting point for a genetic improvement in dairy camels if they participate in a common genetic evaluation program. the exchange can help create a virtually common nuclear flock which can be used for traditional genetic evaluation of sires and dams. genetics of the elite animals can be disseminated to camel owners in respective countries. camel genetics and genomics research is not an exception to this trend. there are relatively few published studies in the area of camel genetics and genomics. however, no commercial genotyping platform has been developed for the species. a gradual urbanization of some pastoral camel populations requires immense infrastructure investments. the relatively small herd size and scattered herds further complicate this issue making it difficult and costly to collect phenotypic data. the cost of implementing such timed breeding regimens can be justifiable by research centers and camel dairies. phenotypes are still very important and the availability of accurate and well defined phenotypes to be used in genetic studies and evaluation programs is imperative. phenotypic recording is rarely practiced in camel populations except in intensive dairy farms. it is therefore challenging for small scale producers to survive without government subsidies and support. if producers' profitability improved, it would become more feasible to participate in genetic selection programs. genetic improvement is certainly promising in camels but would require the collaboration of all stakeholders."}
