{"summary": "many viruses have their own parasites, including defective interfering (DI) RNAs. the origin of satellite RNAs is not known in most cases. both classes of subviral RNA are parasitic, since they have to use proteins coded by viruses. satellite derived DI-RNA strongly interfered with the parental satellite pancium mosaic virus (SPMV) there is a unique complexity and dynamism in viral co-infections that include satellite RNAs, satellite viruses and DI-RNAs. first DI-RNAs associated with a plant virus identified were derived from Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replicase-driven template-switching model is supported by biochemical assays. the list includes two tombusviruses (TBSV and Cucumber necrosis virus, CNV), Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), Cucumber mosaic virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Hepatitis C virus [19\u201324]. the TBSV-associated DI-72 RNA and other tombusvirus DI-RNAs are comprised of four noncontiguous RNA segments. the junction sites among the four noncontiguous regions in the above DI-RNAs do not show long sequence similarity. the recombination events during TBSV DI-RNA formation are unlikely to be random, but guided by cis-acting replication sequences. generation of the 800 nt DI-73 preserves critical replication elements (red) and the 3\u2032CITE. recombination leads to the generation of head-to-tail DI-RNA dimers. new 5\u2032 ends of partially degraded DI-RNAs can then become recombination hotspots. combination based on RNA ligation has also been reported for Q-beta bacteriophage and poliovirus. major evidence provided for RNA breakage and transesterification was interference with recombination when the 3\u2032 OH group in the acceptor strand was altered to inhibit ligation. mutations within the N-terminal portion of p92pol polymerase did not have similar affects on recombination, suggesting different roles for RPR in p33 and p92pol proteins. how these mutations affect recombination, or how they enhance template-switching remains to be tested. cis-acting replication elements likely promote formation of DI-RNAs. recombination junctions were imprecise and clustered around RIII. recombination junctions were imprecise and clustered around RIII. hairpin structures serve as cis-acting replication elements that bind to viral or host proteins. region II (RII) in TBSV is a recombination hot spot [20,32], which is likely due to its ability to bind to the p33 replication protein [54], which is likely due to its ability to bind to the p33 replication protein. dcl-2 (the host dicer gene) mediated the generation of DI-RNA associated with the parent virus. dcl-2 (the host dicer gene) mediated the generation of DI-RNA associated with the parent virus. in dcl-2 strain, the absence of DI-RNA indicated replicase errors might not be the only factors affecting the formation/accumulation of DI-RNAs. host specificity and growth conditions have also been implicated to affect the synthesis DI-RNAs. replicase driven template-switching mechanism RNA recombination plays a major role in producing DI-RNAs or defective RNA particles. errors made by the RdRp during the standard replication process of the viral genome are likely the main mechanism of genomic RNA-RNA recombination and also DI-RNA formation. TBSV-associated DI-72 RNA and other tombusvirus DI-RNAs are comprised of four noncontiguous RNA segments. the junction sites among the four noncontiguous regions in the above DI-RNAs do not show long sequence similarity. it has been suggested that the recombination events during TBSV DI-RNA formation are unlikely to be random. 1, AS2-RS2 and DE-CE interactions are crucial for sgRNA synthesis. generation of 800 nt DI-73 preserves critical replication elements (red) and the 3\u2032CITE. recombination leads to the generation of head-to-tail DI-RNA dimers. replicase driven template-switching mechanism RNA recombination plays a major role in producing DI-RNAs or defective RNA particles (i.e. packaged DI RNAs) it is yet to be seen if this mechanism is involved in DI-RNA formation. cis-acting sequence complementarity between the nascent RNA and the acceptor RNA may guide the template-switching events. additional works revealed recombination \u201ccold-\u201d and \u201chot-spots\u201d. the formation of the prototypical TBSV DI-RNAs requires two or three recombination events. p92pol overlaps with p33, sharing the same initiation codon. translation requires SL3-SLB interaction, UL-DL and RSE-gPR interactions. generation of DI-73 preserves critical replication elements (red) and 3\u2032CITE. vages by host endo- and exoribonucleases lead to partial degradation of the DI-RNA. these new 5\u2032 ends of the partially degraded DI-RNAs can then become recombination hotspots. these different types of recombination events could generate many different DI-RNA recombinants or promote de novo formation of novel DI-RNAs. recombination for tombusvirus DI-RNA was affected by mutations in the RNA binding domain of p33. two p33 mutants tested enhanced the recombination and 5 of the 17 mutants tested slowed down the accumulation of recombinants. recombination promoting mutants also increased subgenomic RNA transcription. p33 and p92pol also affected recombinant DI-RNA formation. it is possible that too high a level of p92pol RdRp makes the viral replicase complexes less precise and more prone to template switching. strong RNA secondary structures in templates can also serve as recombination hot spots. strong hairpins also exist in viral RNAs and they might promote RNA recombination. the presence of the strong RII(+)-SL hairpin that acts as a road block for the host Xrn1p. 11 host genes promoted/modified viral recombinant accumulation. 5 host genes were found to act as TBSV recombination suppressors. XRN1 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exoribonuclease involved in the RNA degradation pathway led to the discovery of partial TBSV RNA degradation products in xrn1 yeast. dcl-2 (the host dicer gene) mediated the generation of DI-RNA associated with a hypovirus infecting Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus. dcl-2 (the host dicer gene) mediated the generation of DI-RNA associated with a hypovirus infecting Cryphonectria parasitica. in pepper, DI-RNA accumulation was easily detectable and able to attenuate the symptoms, whereas in pepper, even continuous virus passages failed to generate detectable levels of DI-RNA. the results suggest that DI-RNA formation is a way for plants to attenuate virus-induced symptoms. the authors suggested that the primary driving force in DI-RNA evolution is the replication efficiency of the DI genome. the deleted region, designated as R3.5, contains a Y-shaped structure that acts as a translation enhancer in the TBSV genomic RNA. this would lead to competition between translation and replication, which are mutually exclusive processes. competition assays using co-inoculation of these DI-RNAs revealed that DI-R1 was more competitive than DI-73 or DI-72 RNAs. the presence of multiple cis-acting elements may help the new DI-RNAs to increase binding to more replicase proteins. the best adapted DI-RNAs are capable of compromise, allowing the helper virus to replicate. this leads to reduced number of helper virus genomes per cell, followed by reduction in the synthesis of viral replication proteins. in many cases, this results in attenuation of disease symptoms caused by the helper virus. RNAs with mosaic genomes, such as the TBSV-associated DI-RNAs (Figure 1) are formed in a step-wise deletion fashion, followed by additional changes to tailor their sizes and RNA structures until they become maximally competitive under that particular environment/selection pressure. the primary driving force in DI-RNA evolution is the replication efficiency of the DI genome. a single U insertion in RII was found to make DI-B103 more competitive than DI-R1 containing two wt RIIs. the presence of multiple cis-acting elements may help the new DI-RNAs to increase viral RNA recruitment. a lack of competition with the helper virus could be counterproductive for the DI-RNA. this leads to reduced number of helper virus genomes per cell, followed by reduction in the synthesis of viral replication proteins. the best adapted DI-RNAs are capable of compromise. in many cases the accumulation of the helper virus is inhibited by the most competitive DI-RNAs, resulting in the symptom attenuation in host plants. the interaction between the DI-RNA, helper virus and the host is more complex due to the effect of DI-RNAs on induction of host defense responses or sequestering resources of the host cells. 4.2. Modulation of the functions of viral factors Several studies on the attenuation effects of DI-RNAs on the symptoms caused by the helper virus did not fit into the simple model of competition desribed above. p19 of tombusviruses has been shown to be a potent suppressor of gene silencing. the presence of DI-RNAs enhanced the generation of virus-specific siRNAs. these free siRNAs could thus trigger robust PTGS against the helper virus. in another study, a more direct role for DI-RNA in triggering gene silencing against its own helper virus emerged. it is not unrealistic to imagine that DI-RNAs can sequester important host factor(s) away from helper virus replication. the helper virus is out-multiplied by the more competitive DI-RNAs. this type of helper virus inhibition by DI-RNA is known to be dose-dependent. p19 of tombusviruses has been shown to be a potent suppressor of gene silencing. p19 of tombusviruses has been shown to be a potent suppressor of gene silencing. p19 of tombusviruses has been shown to be a potent suppressor. a more direct role for DI-RNA in triggering gene silencing against its own helper virus emerged. it was shown that the replication of CymRSV in plants triggered PTGS. this defect was not associated with the RNase complex because the system could efficiently silence the larger DI-RNAs. inant protein production is widespread in research and growing for industrial production of useful proteins. the use of DI-RNA sequence based constructs can be more flexible in their genetic manipulations because they are not required for infection process. a yeast system using TBSV DI-72 as an experimental replicon (rep)RNA was developed. genome-wide and proteomics-based screens have been performed. this in turn accelerated the identification of more than hundred host factors affecting TBSV replication and 40 host factors affecting RNA recombination. the system also useful in dissection of the mechanisms by which these host factors affect viral replication and RNA recombination. TBSV DI-72 (+)RNA was used as a probe to screen RNA binding proteins in a yeast extract capable of supporting one full cycle of replication in vitro. five of the identified host proteins in the above screen were further confirmed with other approaches, e.g. gel-shift and pull-down assays. TBSV assembles the replicase complex on the cytosolic surface of peroxisomal membranes. host protein Pex19p plays a role in TBSV protein transportation to the site of replication. heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is also involved in localization/transportation of viral replication proteins. viral RNA plays an essential role in the assembly of the viral replicase complex in vivo and in vitro. authors have defined the minimal cis-acting elements required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex in yeast. the exact role of the viral RNA in the assembly process is currently under heavy investigation. UL-DL interaction is not crucial for replicase assembly in DI-73. RII(+)-SL and the 3\u2032-UTR are already in close proximity. p33:p33/p92pol interaction domains in these replication proteins seem to be critical for the assembly. the replication process of (+)-stranded RNA viruses and associated DI-RNAs is asymmetrical, leading to 20\u2013100-fold more copies of (+)RNAs than ()-strand RNA. cis-acting elements include the genomic promoter (gPR) in the 3\u2032 end of (+)DI-RNA [106], a complementary promoter element (cPR) in the 3\u2032 end of ()RNA [46] and replication enhancer elements in RI() and RIII GAPDH was shown to bind to (\u2013)-strand of DI-72 repRNA via an AU pentamer sequence. role of GAPDH is to retain the (\u2013)-strand repRNA intermediate in the replicase complex, thus facilitating asymmetrical replication. viral protein modification has been proposed to modulate this process. this is based on the observation that p33 gets phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. p33 mutants mimicking the unphosphorylated stage of the protein bound efficiently to DI-72 RNA. the use of DI-RNAs as surrogate template contributed a great deal to our understanding of viral RNA replication and virus - host interactions. future studies will further exploit DI-RNAs to dissect the mechanism of virus replication, recombination and the role of the host as well as compare similarities between DI-RNAs. a yeast system using TBSV DI-72 as an experimental replicon (rep)RNA was developed. the repRNA works as an independent replicon, capable of assembling the viral replicase complex. this in turn accelerated the identification of more than hundred host factors affecting TBSV replication and 40 host factors affecting RNA recombination. TBSV DI-72 (+)RNA was used as a probe to screen RNA binding proteins in a yeast proteome-wide chip carrying 4,100 purified yeast proteins. eEF1A binds to the silencer sequence present in the 3\u2032UTR [86], which is required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex. a 5 nt base-pairing between RSE in the internal loop sequence of SL3 and gPR stabilizes the tertiary structure. another host factor exerts its effect on viral replication directly via binding to the viral RNA is Nsr1p (also known as nucleolin) this factor was discovered during screening of the yeast knock out library for TBSV replication. heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is also involved in localization/transportation of viral replication proteins. both viral- and host proteins are involved in RNA template selection and recruitment of viral RNA/p33/p92pol complex to the site of replication. the viral RNA plays an essential role in the assembly both in vivo and in vitro. long-range RNA interacting elements UL and DL play a role in replicase assembly. UL and DL sequences juxtapose RII(+)-SL and the replication silencer and gPR within the 3\u2032-UTR. both viral replication proteins of TBSV are essential for the assembly. the replication process of (+)-stranded RNA viruses and associated DI-RNAs is asymmetrical, leading to 20\u2013100-fold more copies of (+)RNAs than ()-strand RNA. the replication process of (+)-stranded RNA viruses and associated DI-RNAs is asymmetrical, leading to 20\u2013100-fold more copies of (+)RNAs than ()-strand RNA. hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was discovered as a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex via a proteomics analysis. TBSV DI-72 RNA was replicated in yeast cells. down-regulation of GAPDH levels in yeast correlated with reduced level of (+)-strand DI repRNA. p33 and YFP-tagged MS2/CP bound to the DI-72(+)/MS2 RNA in yeast cells using epifluorescence microscopy. so far host factors and viral RNA sequences have not been discovered playing role(s) in the release of (+)RNA progeny. but viral protein modification has been proposed to modulate this process. ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34p and Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase have been shown to ubiquitinate p33 in vitro. but the actual role of p33 ubiquitination is currently unknown. future studies will further exploit DI-RNAs to dissect the mechanism of virus replication, recombination and the role of the host. acting elements for replication were also discovered using DI-RNAs. these advances indicate that DI-RNAs are highly evolved molecules. future experiments will likely dissect the detailed mechanisms of DI-RNA formation and evolution during viral infection."}
