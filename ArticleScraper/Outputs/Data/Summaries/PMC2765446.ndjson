{"summary": "328 respondents completed a cross-sectional internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148) measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home. 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. the WHO raised their flu alert to level 5 on 29th April 2009. by 6th May there had been 27 confirmed cases in Europe, but none in Asia. data was collected from 328 respondents (mean age 31.2, SD 13.37, 62% female) respondents were primarily from the UK and Portugal. also included 30 respondents living outside these countries. ten non-European based residents were then removed from the online survey before analysis. open-ended question asked 'how can you protect yourself from infection'. responses categorised for frequency in Malaysia and Europe. asked 'how can you protect yourself from infection' questionnaire was distributed in Malaysia, with students recruiting 180 respondents from their own classes and community members from residential areas and local offices in Kuala Lumpur. responses were generally good, with 180 out of 200 approached to participate (90%) completing the questionnaire. respondents were primarily from the UK and Portugal. respondents completed closed-format 3-point scales, indicating the extent to which they believed these groups were more at risk than me, the same risk as me or less at risk than me. anxiety indicators were assessed through two closed-format questions assessing personal worries about catching the virus (measured on a 4-point scale, from very concerned to not at all concerned) we asked about the mortality rate in ordinary, seasonal flu (five point scale, under 50,000, 50-000-99,000, 100,000-249,000, 250,000-500,000 and over 500,000) and whether seasonal flu vaccination provided immunity against swine flu. approximately a third of respondents reported they would use public transport less (116/320) or had contemplated cancelling or delaying flights (124/312) 124 (39) No 79 (44) 119 (83) 188 (61) Purchased goods (e.g. face masks) Yes 14 (8) 11 (7) 0.14 25 (8) No 166 (92) 137 (93) 303 (92) Intend to purchase goods Yes 74 (41) 22 (15) 27.03** 96 (29) No 106 (59) 126 (85) 232 (71) Risk groups Pig farmers More risk than me 157 (88) 72 (49) 68.03** 229 only a little concerned 39 (22) 48 (33) 87 (27) Not at all concerned 12 (7) 61 (42) 73 (23) Control over whether infected Great deal 35 (20) 19 (13) 2.83 54 (16) Little 97 (55) 90 (61) 187 (57) None 46 (26) 38 (26) 84 (26) Contacted friends to discuss threat Yes No 49 (28) 31 (22) 1.54 80 (25) 119 (73) 113 (79) 242 (75) 71% (127/178) indicated they were at least'somewhat concerned'. most anxious about personally being a victim of the pandemic were the most likely to reduce their use of public transport (r (320) and cancel/delay air travel (r (322). x2 (1) = 21.91, 49.20, both p.001 for differences between Malaysia and Europe. most likely to be purchased were masks (mentioned 46 times in Malaysia, 14 in Europe) and food (14 times Malaysia, 5 times in Europe) the elderly More risk 87 (49) 96 (65) 8.27* 183 (57) Same risk 76 (43) 42 (28) 118 (36) Less risk 13 (7) 10 (7) 23 (7) Homeless More risk 96 (55) 74 (50) 10.23** 170 (53) Same risk 67 (38) 73 (49) 140 (43) Less risk 12 (7) 1 (1) 13 (4) Homosexuals More risk 56 (32) 11 (8) 31.82** 67 (21) Same risk 13 we reran these analyses using logistic regressions controlling for age and sex. percentages are rounded so may not all always add to 100. 'Risk groups' and personal anxiety were seen as particularly at risk by more than half of our respondents. the most anxious about personally being a victim of the outbreak were the most likely to reduce their use of public transport (r (320) =.48, p.001) and cancel/delay air travel (r (322) =.37, p.001) respondents wrongly believed that a vaccination for seasonal flu gave immunity against swine flu. the same percentage believed swine flu symptoms differ from those of seasonal flu. rumours spread fast during times of pandemic threat, with significant risks of emotional as well as physical 'contagion' practitioners need to be aware that rumours spread fast during times of pandemic threat, with significant risks of emotional as well as physical 'contagion' our study was unique in tracing initial behavioural responses to this pandemic. our respondents were not true random samples in either continent. our data was drawn from one large city - Kuala Lumpur - and therefore cannot be seen as representative of the whole continent. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/166/prepub Acknowledgements We would like to thank Hui Chiet, Wei Pyng and Melissa Shuen Yun for their help in collecting the data."}
