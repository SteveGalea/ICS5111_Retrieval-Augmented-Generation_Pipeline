{"summary": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have critical roles in suppressing pro-inflammatory immune responses. they are required for entry of immune cells into sites of inflammation. in chronic viral infections, such as those caused by HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, Friend virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) pathogen-specific Tregs are more potent than bulk populations of Tregs obtained from wild type mice. they are required to diminish immune-mediated disease in these mice. depletion converted encephalitis to one with high mortality. FN- expression by Tregs was detected directly ex vivo in the absence of peptide stimulation if mice were treated with brefeldin A prior to sacrifice. a mouse transgenic for the expression of an M133-specific T cell receptor [23] and used Tregs (M133 Tregs) from these mice in the current study. the ratio of M133 to bulk Tregs ranged from 101 in lymphoid tissue to greater than 10001 in the brain by day 7 post infection (p.i.) the ratio of M133 to bulk Tregs ranged from 101 in lymphoid tissue to greater than 10001 in the brain. gfp and M133 Tg-Foxp3gfp mice were mixed at a 11 ratio. a total of 3105 cells were transferred to CD45/Thy1 congenic mice one day prior to infection with rJ2.2. a total of 3105 cells were transferred to CD45/Thy1 congenic mice. expression of CXCR3 was upregulated within 1\u20132 rounds of proliferation. by day 4 p.i., M133 Tconv accounted for 10% of all CD4 T cells in the DCLN. by day 5, cells that had undergone varying numbers of divisions were detected in all tissues except the brain. cells were analyzed at days 2\u20134 instead of days 3\u20135 to capture early cell proliferation. by day 2 p.i, we observed five generations (4 divisions) of violet-labeled Tconv in the DCLN but not other tissues. by day 4 p.i., M133 Tconv and Tregs that had undergone extensive division were detected in the DCLN and CLN. M133 Tregs and M133 Tconv were mixed at a 21 ratio and labeled with Violet. 1.5105 cells were transferred to Thy1 congenic mice one day prior to infection with rJ2.2. the DCLN were the initial site of priming, and M133 Tconv and Treg proliferation was also detected in the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. in these experiments, equal numbers of M133 Tconv and Tregs were transferred to B6 mice. in these experiments, equal numbers of M133 Tconv and Tregs were transferred to B6 mice. the presence of M133 Tregs resulted in decreased numbers of Tconv in the spleen and brain at all times p.i., suggesting an effect on Tconv proliferation. however, the effects of transferred M133 Tregs were more complicated in the DCLN. levels of CD25 and CD69 were detected on undivided M133 Tconv. expression of CD25 and CD69 followed similar kinetics in the presence or absence of Tregs. however, levels of both molecules were lower in the presence of Tregs. expression levels of CD69 and CD25 on undivided and divided M133 Tconv. overlayed histograms showing proliferation of M133 Tconv in absence or presence of co-transferred M133 Tregs in DCLN and spleen at days 3, 4 and 5 p.i. decreased Tconv numbers in the DCLN decreased from day 4 to day 5 when transferred alone, indicating significant cell egress. decreased Tconv numbers could reflect increased levels of apoptosis, but the fraction of Tconv apoptosis was the same in the presence or absence of transferred M133 Tregs in the DCLN at day 4. T-bet was expressed by both types of cells at this early time post infection, after either one (Tconv) or three (Treg) cell divisions. IL-10 expression by both M133 Tconv and Tregs occurred after direct ex vivo stimulation with M133 peptide. transferred M133 Tregs enhance survival and diminish the M133 Tconv immune response in the infected brain. 105 M133 Tregs, bulk Tregs or B6-derived Foxp3CD4 T cells (control group) were transferred to infected mice one day prior to rJ2.2 infection. 18\u201322 mice in 4 independent experiments were analyzed for survival and weight loss. mice in spleen, DCLN and brain of recipients were monitored. data are representative of three independent experiments with 3\u20135 mice/group. most transferred M133 Tregs expressed IL-10 or IL-10 and IFN- after direct ex vivo peptide stimulation. IFN- was expressed at lower levels per Treg than per effector CD4 T cell. 133 peptide was included in the in vitro suppression assay to activate M133 Tregs. in order to distinguish proliferation of M133 and S358 CD4 or S510 CD8 T cells, the latter cells were obtained from mice infected with virus lacking expression of the M133 epitope. splenic C57BL/6 (B6) Tregs (bulk Tregs) were detected in the rJ2.2-infected brain. however, adoptively transferred bulk populations of splenic C57BL/6 (B6) Tregs (bulk Tregs) were minimally detected in the infected central nervous system. blood was obtained from B6-Foxp3gfp and M133 Tg-Foxp3gfp mice. analyzed for presence of M133-specific Tregs and Tconv using I-Ab/M133 tetramers. representative plots after gating on CD4 T cells are shown. data are representative of analyses of three individual recipients (M133 Tregs) and 2 pooled samples (bulk Tregs) initial proliferation of M133-specific Tconv occurs in the DCLN. 1105 CFSE labeled M133 Tconv were transferred to Thy1 congenic mice one day prior to rJ2.2 infection. CFSE levels on transferred cells at several times p.i. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. only very few M133 CD4 T cells entered the brain at days 3 or 4 p.i. Exposure to M133 antigen was required for proliferation because neither M133 Tconv nor M133 Treg proliferated in mice infected with a rJ2.2 mutant. the data are representative of four (B, C, D, F, three mice per time point) or one (E, four individual mice) independent experiments. the data are representative of four (B, C, D, F, three mice per time point) or one (E, four individual mice) only highly divided cells were detected in the DCLN in treated mice. in the absence of FTY720, cells with only partial dye dilution were detected. this suggests that all priming occurs in the cervical lymph nodes, predominantly in the DCLN. conv or 2.25105 mixed cells were transferred into Thy1 congenic mice one day prior to rJ2.2 infection. asterisks indicate statistical significance when mice receiving M133 Tconv and M133 Tregs were compared to those receiving only M133 Tconv or M133 Tconv and bulk Tregs. M133 Tconv or M133 Tconv and M133 Tregs (12 ratio) were labeled with Violet and transferred into Thy1 congenic mice prior to rJ2.2 infection. organs were harvested at the indicated time points and lymphocyte populations examined directly ex vivo. Tconv that had undergone more divisions were detected in the presence of Tregs, resulting in a higher expansion index (EI) at day 3 p.i., only the EI in the DCLN at day 3 p.i. is shown because the EI cannot be calculated when there are too few cells in the parent generation (DCLN and spleen at day 3 in the presence of M133 Tregs) T-bet expression in Tconv was less elevated in the presence of transferred Tregs. in the spleen and brain, both effects contributed to decreased numbers of Tconv. a balance of opposing effects on migration and proliferation was determined. violet labeled M133 Tconv (0.75105) or M133 Tregs (1.5105) were transferred to infected mice one day prior to rJ2.2 infection. cells were examined for T-bet expression directly ex vivo or for IFN- and IL-10 expression. 105 M133 Tregs, bulk Tregs or B6-derived Foxp3CD4 T cells (control group) were transferred to Thy1 congenic mice one day prior to rJ2.2 infection. 18\u201322 mice in 4 independent experiments were analyzed for survival and weight loss. representative dot plots show expression levels of IFN- and IL-10 by exogenous M133 Tregs. lower levels of IFN- were expressed by M133 Tregs when compared to Tconv. M133 Tregs preferentially suppressed the proliferation of M133-specific Tconvs in an in vitro suppression assay. we obtained CD4 and CD8 T cells from infected mice and labeled them with violet. despite the results shown in Figure 9B and C, M133 Tregs preferentially suppressed the proliferation of M133-specific Tconvs. gs were pre-activated in vitro for 24 hours and co-cultured with the labeled responders and irradiated antigen presenting cells (CHB3 cells) cells were stimulated with the indicated peptides for 66 hours and then analyzed for Violet dilution. the use of pathogen epitope-specific Tregs allowed for a targeted immune response with effects primarily on T cells responding to the same epitope. in mice infected with Mtb, adoptive transfer of pathogen epitope-specific Tregs resulted in delayed effector CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. fewer M133 Tconv were detected in the spleen at this time point after co-transfer. these results are similar to those obtained from FTY720-treated mice. they showed that when T cell egress was blocked, proliferating cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes. non virus-specific Tregs are important for initial egress from lymphoid tissue to sites of inflammation. but virus-specific Tregs function to inhibit migration of virus-specific T cells to the infected site. similar results were obtained when the suppressive ability of M133 Tregs was examined in vitro. Tregs in the infected brain expressed IFN-, albeit at lower levels on a per cell basis when compared to Tconv. the expression of IFN- does not abrogate the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs in vitro or in mice. the expression of IFN- may contribute to the inflammatory milieu. compared to bulk Tregs, virus epitope-specific Tregs would have the advantage of specifically diminishing numbers and function of pathogenic CD4 T cells responding to the same epitope without generally suppressing the anti-virus T cell response. these results suggest a possible role in viral infections. 6\u20137-week-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 600 PFU rJ2.2 or 2,000 PFU rJ2.2.MY135Q in 30 l DMEM. after viral inoculation, mice were examined and weighed daily. perCP-CY5.5 (OX-7), Thy1.2-PE or \u2013APC (30-H12), streptavidin-APC, -eFluor 450 or -BV510 were analyzed using a BD. cells were then stained with anti-CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 at 4\u00b0C. effector T cells (Tconv and Tregs) were stimulated with 5 M peptides M133 or S358 (CD4 T cells) or 1 M S510 (CD8 T cells) in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. intracellular expression of IFN- and IL-10 was assayed. CD4 and CD8 T cells were labeled with anti-mouse CD8-APC, B220-APC and streptavidin-APC. Tconvs were then sorted twice using yield mode followed by purity mode on a FACSDiva or FACSAria (BD) rJ2.2.MY135Q-infected (S358-specific CD4 and S510-specific CD8) mice were sorted from nave M133 TCR Tg/Foxp3gfp/Thy1.1 mice at day -1. mice were stimulated with coated anti-CD3 mAb+anti-CD28 mAb (5 g/ml each) for 24 hours and washed thoroughly before use. mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 600 PFU rJ2.2 or 2,000 PFU rJ2.2.MY135Q in 30 l DMEM. animal experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. purified functional anti-CD3 (145-2C11) and anti-CD28 (37.51), B220-APC (RA3-6B2), CD4-FITC, -PE, -PerCP-Cy5.5, -PE-CY7, or -eFluor 450 (RM 4\u20135), CD8-APC (53\u20136.7), CD11c-PE (HL3), CD16/CD32-biotin (93), CD25-PE (PC61 peripheral blood was collected from the orbital sinus of WT-Foxp3gfp or M133 Tg-Foxp3gfp mice using heparinized Natelson blood collecting tubes. 100 l blood were incubated with equal volumes of RP10 media containing 5U heparin and 1.6 g PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers. cells were then stained with anti-CD4-PerCP residues 133\u2013147 of the transmembrane (M) protein and residues 358\u2013372 and 510\u2013518 of the surface (S) glycoprotein were assayed. BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and Perm/Wash buffers (BD Biosciences) were used in intracellular cytokine staining assays. about 50% and 97% of Tregs and Tconvs in M133 TCR Tg/Foxp3gfp mice were M133-specific. cells were transferred to 6\u20137 week congenic B6 mice 24 hours prior to rJ2.2 infection. recipient mice were treated intraperitoneally with 80 g FTY720 0.5 hour prior to infection. cells were cultivated with 2.5105 irradiated CHB3 cells (2000 rad) and the indicated number of M133 Tregs per well. cells were harvested and stained with anti-Thy1.2 and anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies."}
