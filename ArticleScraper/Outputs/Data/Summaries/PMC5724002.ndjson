{"summary": "NDV contains a single-stranded, negative-sense, non-segmented RNA genome. the 15-kb genomic RNA contains six genes that encode nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix, fusion (F), hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN) and polymerase (L) glycosylation in the envelope glycoproteins of Nipah virus, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), west Nile virus, and influenza virus is associated with viral pathogenicity (7\u201311). one is located in the stalk region at residue 119 (G1) and the remaining three are located in the globular head at residues 341, 433, and 481 (G2, G3, and G4 respectively). galectins (S-type lectins) were initially thought to recognize endogenous host glycans and mediate diverse biological processes (17, 18) they could also bind glycans on the surface of potentially pathogenic microorganisms to function as recognition and effective factors in innate immunity (7, 8, 19). galectin-1 specifically cross-links N-glycans on Nipah virus envelope glycoproteins, resulting in aberrant oligomerization and the abundance of CG-1B in chicken tracheal tissue was increased after inoculation with lentogenic NDV La Sota (25). viral loads were detected in trachea, cecal tonsil, proventriculus, harderian glands, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and bursa of fabricius. no NDV RNA was detected in chickens from the control group. data were normalized with expression of 18S rRNA gene. change in mRNA level of CG-1B in each tissue at 24 hpi was compared with that of 48 hpi. results indicated that CG-1B was up-regulated in target organs. CG-1B binds to NDV and inhibits viral HA activity. a velogenic strain can induce severe lesions and 100% mortality within 3\u20134 days post-infection. CG-1B binds to NDV and inhibits viral HA activity. the number of virions bound to CG-1B was calculated based on the linear standard curves. chicken lectin and human galectin-1 inhibit HA activity of influenza virus (8, 27) CG-1B directly binds to NDV and inhibits HA activity of NDV. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity of CG-1B on NDVs was specific and glycan-dependent. CG-1B inhibits HA activity of NDV. database searches positively identified HN of NDV La Sota strain and Italian strain. no HN protein was precipitated with anti-His antibody in the absence of CG-1B. gG2 was used as the isotype control antibody of His and HN monoclonal antibodies. the precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-NDV HN and anti-His monoclonal antibodies. proteins with significant ion score of >21 (p 0.05) were considered successfully identified. c Peptides identified by LC-MS/MS matched the successfully identified protein. all recovered mutant viruses were subjected to RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from the recovered mutant viruses using primers LaFull-F and LaFull-R. the fragments containing the mutant sites were amplified by RT-PCR. all viruses reached maximum titers at 72 hpi. maximum titers of la Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G4 were comparable. parental and other HN mutant viruses had the lowest virus titers. viral loads in trachea, lung, and brain were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. no viral RNA was detected in brains from any infected chickens. the viral loads in the trachea from la Sota-G4- and -G12-infected groups were lowest among all groups at 1 and 3 dpi. the viral loads in the trachea were lowest among all groups at 1 and 3 dpi. the ability of CG-1B to bind to NDV and NDV-HN mutants was tested by the above-mentioned ELISA. the levels of HN and HN mutants in parental and HN mutant viruses were first quantified by ELISA based on the linear range of HN protein. insufficient La Sota-G4 N-glycans contribute significantly to CG-1B binding to NDV HN glycoprotein. CG-1B binds to specific N-glycans on NDV HN glycoprotein. CG-1B binds to specific N-glycans on NDV HN protein. CG-1B was incubated with viral lysates of parental and HN mutant viruses. lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-His and anti-HN monoclonal antibody. CG-1B inhibits NDV adsorption rather than internalization. pre-treatment of DF-1 cells with CG-1B significantly inhibited NDV adsorption. pre-treatment of DF-1 cells with CG-1B prior to virus inoculation had no significant effect on the adsorption of NDV. this inhibitory effect of CG-1B on NDV adsorption was reversed by addition of -galactose. DF-1 cells were inoculated with NDV F48E9 and La Sota at m.o.i. 1 at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. un-internalized viruses were inactivated with citrate buffer. pCAGGS-FLAG-CG-1B-transfected, untransfected, and untransfected DF-1 cells treated with CG-1B after adsorption. viral titer in the culture supernatants of DF-1 cells was determined at 16 and 24 hpi by the Reed-Muench method in DF-1 cells. la Sota, la Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4, and -G12 was performed in the presence of CG-1B and -galactose. adsorption of parental and HN mutant virus-incubated DF-1 cells was significantly inhibited by CG-1B. loss of G4 N-glycans may result in misfolding of HN protein. loss of G4 and G12 N-glycans may impair the fusion promotion activity of HN protein, which leads to inefficient internalization of la Sota-G4 and -G12. CG-1B treatment had no obvious effects on the internalization of all HN mutant viruses. CG-1B reduces NDV replication in DF-1 cells. CG-1B and HN glycoprotein were distributed on the cell membrane surface in pCAGGS-FLAG-CG-1B-transfected and control DF-1 cells. CG-1B and HN glycoprotein were co-localized in the cytoplasm of F48E9- and La Sota-infected DF-1 cells treated with CG-1B after adsorption. DF-1 cells treated with 7 m CG-1B after incubation were used as controls. cells were fixed at 24 h after infection and then subjected to indirect immunofluorescence to detect CG-1B and NDV HN glycoprotein. replication levels of La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4, and -G12 in LMH cells were significantly declined in CG-1B-overexpression LMH cells. however, replication levels of La Sota and La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G12 were significantly declined in CG-1B-overexpression LMH cells. the expression of CG-1B was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. at 48 h post-transfection, the CG-1B knockdown LMH cells were infected with La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4 and -G12 at m.o.i. 0.1. viral load was persistently elevated with time and significantly increased in trachea, cecal tonsil, proventriculus, harderian glands, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and bursa of fabricius. viral load was persistently elevated with time and significantly increased in trachea, harderian gland, kidney, lung, and bursa of fabricius. mRNA level of CG-1B was significantly up-regulated in trachea, cecal tonsil, proventriculus, harderian gland, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and bursa of fabricius. mRNA levels of CG-1B in liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and bursa of fabricius were dropped considerably at various degrees from 24 to 48 hpi. CG-1B binds to NDV and inhibits viral HA activity. ELISA curves were established based on OD values of 2-fold serially diluted NDVs. -Galactose or mannose was used as an antagonist. uninfected chick embryo allantoic fluid and BSA were used as negative controls of CG-1B. hemagglutination inhibition activity of CG-1B on NDVs was specific and glycan-dependent. CG-1B directly binds to NDV and inhibits HA activity of NDV. CG-1B inhibits HA activity of NDV. database searches positively identified HN of NDV La Sota strain and Italian strain, which shares significant amino acid similarity with F48E9. no HN protein was precipitated with anti-His antibody in the absence of CG-1B. the precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-NDV HN and anti-His monoclonal antibodies. the protein was interacted with CG-1B by LC-MS/MS No. Accession no.a Ion scoresb Mass Matched peptidesc Sequence coverage Protein name % 1 P35743 3762 63,854 AVSQVALENDEREAK 65 HN OS = NDV (strain chicken/United States/LaSota/4 proteins with significant ion score of >21 (p 0.05) were considered successfully identified. c Peptides identified by LC-MS/MS matched the successfully identified protein. all recovered mutant viruses were subjected to RT-PCR. the mutant sites were amplified by RT-PCR using primers LaFull-F and LaFull-R. the titers of all mutant viruses at 24 hpi were significantly lower than the parental virus (p 0.05) all viruses reached maximum titers at 72 hpi. maximum titers of la Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G4 were comparable. parental and other HN mutant viruses had the lowest virus titers. ral load in tissues was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. no viral RNA was detected in brains from any infected chickens. viral loads in the trachea were significantly lower than those of parental virus-infected chickens at 1 and 3 dpi. ta-G4- and -G12-infected groups were significantly lower than those of other groups at 1, 3 and 6 dpi. viral loads in the trachea from la Sota-G4-infected groups were lowest among all groups at 1 and 3 dpi. similar results were observed in lungs. the levels of HN and HN mutants in parental and HN mutant viruses were first quantified by ELISA based on the linear range of the la Sota standard curve. insufficient La Sota-G4 N-glycans contribute significantly to CG-1B binding to NDV HN glycoprotein. CG-1B also bound less La Sota-G1 (0.60), -G2 (0.58), -G3 (0.64) and -G12 (0 CG-1B binds to specific N-glycans on NDV HN glycoprotein. CG-1B binds to specific N-glycans on NDV HN protein. lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-His and anti-HN monoclonal antibody. the precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-NDV HN and anti-His monoclonal antibodies. CG-1B inhibits NDV adsorption rather than internalization. pre-treatment of DF-1 cells with CG-1B significantly inhibited NDV adsorption. pre-treatment of DF-1 cells with CG-1B prior to virus inoculation had no significant effect on the adsorption of NDV. this effect was mediated by specific interaction of CG-1B with NDV HN protein. DF-1 cells were inoculated with La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4 and -G12. cells were washed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. un-internalized viruses were inactivated with citrate buffer. viral titer in the culture supernatants of DF-1 cells was determined at 16 and 24 hpi by the Reed-Muench method. viral titer in the culture supernatants of DF-1 cells was determined at 24 and 48 hpi by HA assay. CG-1B added after inoculation at 4 \u00b0C did not inhibit viral entry. the results of adsorption assay showed no significant differences in the NDV genomic RNA copy numbers in parental and HN mutant virus-incubated DF-1 cells. loss of G4 and G12 N-glycans may result in misfolding of HN protein, and simultaneously eliminate the G12 N-glycans that may lead to improper interaction of HN with F protein. CG-1B reduces NDV replication in DF-1 cells transfected with pCAGGS-FLAG-CG-1B or control plasmid pCAGGS-FLAG. titers of progeny virus in pCAGGS-FLAG-CG-1B-transfected cells were significantly lower than in pCAGGS-FLAG-CG-1B-transfected and control DF-1 cells. CG-1B and HN glycoprotein were distributed on the cell membrane surface in pCAGGS-FLAG-transfected and control DF-1 cells. CG-1B and HN glycoprotein were co-localized in the cytoplasm of DF-1 cells treated with CG-1B after adsorption. expression of NDV HN glycoprotein on the cell surface was quantified by flow cytometry. untreated DF-1 cells were treated with 7 m CG-1B after incubation. DF-1 cells were fixed at 24 h after infection and then subjected to indirect immunofluorescence to detect CG-1B and NDV HN glycoprotein using rabbit anti-FLAG/His antibody. replication levels of La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G12 in LMH cells were significantly declined in CG-1B-overexpression LMH cells. however, replication levels of La Sota and La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G12 were significantly declined in CG-1B-overexpression LMH cells. the expression of CG-1B was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. at 48 h post-transfection, the CG-1B knockdown LMH cells were infected with La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4 and -G12 at m.o.i. 0.1. mammalian galectin-1 may participate in host antiviral defense or promote the course of virus invasion through specific interaction with glycans on the viral envelope glycoprotein. CG-1B reduces NDV infection by inhibiting both adsorption and replication processes of NDV. a velogenic NDV strain can cause systemic infection and result in 100% mortality within 72\u201396 hpi in chickens. the high levels of virus replication may stimulate the host to produce CG-1B rapidly (24 hpi) the rapid replication of F48E9 in most organs could induce severe lesions and subsequently decrease expression of CG-1B with time. complex-type glycans arising from the tertiary structure of HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein contribute mostly to its specific recognition by galectin-1 (9) the faster migration rate of the HN G4 mutant indicates the G4 N-glycans are a complex type, higher than other sites, and significantly contribute to the specific interaction with CG-1B. CG-1B may specifically cross-link the N-glycans displayed in the HN globular domain to create a viral surface galectin\u2013glycoprotein lattice. this further interferes with the process of cell-receptor recognition mediated by HN glycoprotein through the steric hindrance. glycans are critical for folding, transport, and biological activities of viral glycoproteins (5, 6, 12, 48) extracellular CG-1B secreted from cells may result in inhibition of NDV replication by interfering with release of progeny virus. the interaction between intracellular CG-1B and HN glycoprotein may inhibit NDV replication by preventing maturation and function of HN glycoprotein. the replication levels of all HN mutants in chicken embryos and 1-day-old chickens were lower than parental virus at different degrees. in CG-1B knockdown LMH cells, the replication levels of La Sota, La Sota-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G12 were significantly higher than that of La Sota-G4. the replication kinetics of parental and HN mutant viruses in mouse-origin BHK-21 cells without expressing CG-1B were similar to those in CG-1B knockdown LMH cells. the N-glycans on the G4 site are closely related to the processing and biological activities of the HN glycoprotein. loss of G4 N-glycans can reduce NA and fusion activities (5, 12) and decrease internalization efficiency. CG-1B may also be explored for targeting other important avian viruses. cell and viruses DF-1, BSR-T7/5, and LMH cells were cultured in DMEM. all strains were propagated once in 9\u201311-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. real-time RT-PCR was performed on a lightCycler\u00ae 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) samples from chickens mock-inoculated with sterile allantoic fluid were used as a negative control. the recombinant plasmid pET-CG-1B was encoding the CG-1B protein fused to a His tag at its C terminus. the recombinant plasmid was constructed by cloning CG-1B CDS into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a (+) using NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes. CG-1B (4 m) in the presence of 0.1 m -galactose or mannose was incubated with NDV F48E9 and La Sota containing different HAUs for 1 h at room temperature, followed by addition of 1% PBRCs. after an additional 30-min incubation, HA was recorded. a total of 100 l of 6 log2 HAU of NDV F48E9 or La Sota, diluted in 1% BSA/PBS, was added and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. uninfected SPF chicken embryo allantoic fluid and BSA were used as negative controls. bound viral proteins were eluted with 0.1 m -galactose in PBS. samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with coomassie blue R-350. protein bands were excised from the gels and subjected to LC-MS/MS identification. the co-IP assay was performed with anti-His antibody in the absence of CG-1B. normal mouse IgG2 was used as the isotype control antibody for His and HN monoclonal antibody. double mutant was obtained by mutating the second glycosylation site on the cDNA clone G1 with the specific primers for constructing the cDNA clone. the resulting mutated full-length cDNA plasmids were designed as pNDFL-G1, -G2, -G3, -G4, and -G12. b Kozak sequence is underlined.
