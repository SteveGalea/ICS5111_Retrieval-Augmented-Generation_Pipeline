{"summary": "the large size of the genome requires unusual enzymatic activities, such as an exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease activity (11), in order to maintain genetic stability. the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs by the discontinuous transcription strategy used by coronaviruses demands a huge and complicated replication/transcription complex. a hollow, cylindrical hexadecamer revealed a hollow, cylindrical hexadecamer composed of eight copies of Nsp8 and eight copies of Nsp7 (31). the channel with a diameter of about 30 at the center suggested that it could encircle double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), in accordance with the observation that it was lined by positively charged amino acid residues. the function of Nsp7 in the primase activity is poorly characterized thus far. hexadecameric hexadecameric hexadecamer is regarded as \u201cmortar\u201d stabilizing the hexadecameric Nsp7+8 complex structure (31), without having significant influence on the synthesis of RNA primers. we still do not know the stoichiometry between the two components in vivo, or whether various s polyprotein is an intermediate of pp1a and pp1ab processing and unlikely to form the same hexadecamer as the SARS-CoV complex. in case of FCoV both Nsp7 and Nsp8 are dimeric in solution, but the Nsp7+8 complex is a 2:1 heterotrimer rather than a hexadecamer. p7 and Nsp8 DNA sequences encoding Nsp7 and Nsp8 were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers encoding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. both sequence-verified clones were cloned into expression vector pGEX-6p-1 using BamHI and XhoI sites. the lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 90 min at 4\u00b0C. the soluble fraction was applied onto a pre-equilibrated 5-ml GSTrap FF column. the eluted samples were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. the supernatant was loaded onto a hisTrap HP column. the protein was eluted with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) and further purified by SEC using the procedure described above. XPREP (Bruker) was used to further analyze and prepare data sets for structure solution and refinement. the program XPREP (Bruker) was used to further analyze and prepare data sets for structure solution. 0\u201377 No. of protein atoms 5,498 No. of water molecules 77 RMSD in bond lengths () 0.010 RMSD in bond angles (\u00b0) Mostly favored 97.3 Additionally allowed 2.4 Outliers 0.3 a Rint = ||Fo|2 |Fo|2>| |/|Fo|2. the |Fo|2 values are the intensities of the reflections in the unique data. all samples were diluted to 2 mg/ml in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)\u2013200 mM NaCl\u20135 mM DTT. an aliquot of 25% glutaraldehyde was diluted and added to the protein samples to give a final concentration of 0.01% (for Nsp7 and Nsp8) or 0.05% (for the Nsp7+8 complex) a photon-counting PILATUS detector with 1 million pixels was used to record the scattered X-rays at a wavelength of 1.54. the sample-to-detector distance was 2.7 m, yielding a maximum recordable momentum transfer (s = 4 sin/) of 0.6. RNA oligonucleotide representing stem-loop 1 of the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of the FCoV strain FIPV WSU-79/1146 genome was used as a template in the de novo polymerase reaction. the reaction was carried out by incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of EDTA. pET11d-229E710 encoding C-terminally His6-tagged HCoV-229E Nsp7-10 polyprotein was provided by John Ziebuhr (Queen's University, Belfast, United Kingdom) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged FCoV Nsp7 and Nsp8, DNA sequences encoding Nsp7 and Nsp8 were amplified by PCR using Pfu the culture was grown at 37\u00b0C in 2YT medium with vigorous shaking until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8 (Nsp8) or 1.3 (Nsp7) expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) and incubation at 25\u00b0C for 16 h. cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. the HCoV-229E polyprotein Nsp7-10 and the N-terminally His6-tagged FCoV Nsp8 were concentrated to 5 and 15 mg/ml. the protein was then eluted with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) and further purified by SEC using the procedure described above. Tiny crystals appeared in a drop containing 2.4 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) optimized crystals suitable for diffraction were grown in drops containing 1.5 l of protein solution and 1.5 l of reservoir solution at 4\u00b0C. reflections 31,155 16,370/16,291 Completeness (%) 99.8 (100) 99.8 (99.9)/99.7 (99.3) Mean I/(I) 20.38 (3.33) 24.74 (4.92)/23.52 (3.62) Multiplicity 7.23 (7.41) 14.48 (14.99)/14.60 (14.90) Rint (%) 5.77 (62.0) 7.81 (48.4)/8.42 (48.4) c Values are presented as \u201cpeak/inflection\u201d where applicable. the crystal structure of the FCoV Nsp7+8 complex was determined by using the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. the solution states of Nsp7, Nsp8, and the Nsp7+8 complex were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) a 1-ml portion of protein solution at a concentration of 15 mg/ml was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) and then eluted with buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM standard SAXS data reduction and analysis were carried out using PRIMUS (15) the forward scattering I(0) and radius of gyration Rg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (9) the molecular mass of the solutes was evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering I(0) to that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. the maximum size of the protein molecule (Dmax) and the pair distance distribution function p(r) were calculated using the high-resolution model from mM DTT, 1 Ci of [-32P]GTP, 20 M (each) ATP, CTP, and UTP, and 2 M RNA templates. reaction was carried out by incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of EDTA. Nsp8, Nsp7I, and Nsp7II are colored in sky blue, red, and green. red and blue surfaces represent negative and positive potentials (10 kBT to 10 kBT), respectively. helix H4 is far apart from helix H1 (the distance between Val12 [C1] and Leu71 [C2] is 12.31) but in Nsp7II, these two helices are much closer to one another. the reason for this conformational difference is the insertion of Nsp8 helix N3 in between Nsp7 H1 and H4 in molecule Nsp7I. the alignments were achieved by using CLUSTAL W2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/), and colored figures were generated by ESPript2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/ESPript/) sp7) and NP_835349.1 (Nsp8); mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), NP_740612.1 (Nsp7) and NP_740613.1 (Nsp8); infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), NP_740625.1 (Nsp7) and NP_740626.1 (Nsp7); bat coronavirus HKU8, YP_0017 the N-terminal shaft domain contains four helices (N1, residues 5 to 28; N2, residues 32 to 76; N3, residues 80 to 98; and N4, residues 101 to 112) another three -helices (C1, 134 to 140; C2, 168 to 172; and C3, 174 to 179) packed against a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet (1, residues 115 to 118; 2, residues 127 to 132; the bend provides rotational freedom for the N-terminal shaft domain to swing around the C-terminal \u201cgrip\u201d domain. it is likely that the bend provides rotational freedom for the N-terminal shaft domain to swing around the C-terminal \u201cgrip\u201d domain. residues on helices H1 and H2 of Nsp7I (Cys8, Val11, Val12, Leu14, and Leu41) and residues on helices H3 and H4 of Nsp7I (Leu49, Leu53, Ile56, Leu60, and Ile72) the side chain of Nsp8 Arg111 (N) forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the side chains of both Nsp7I Glu73 ( the two copies of the Nsp7+8 heterotrimer present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form a heterohexamer through interaction between the N-terminal shaft domains of the Nsp8 molecules. the multimeric states of isolated coronavirus Nsp7 and Nsp8 are poorly described and remain controversial. the Nsp7+8 complex eluted with a retention volume of 58.23 ml. the MM corresponded reasonably well to the MM indicated by cross-linking (39.5 kDa) the estimated MMs were 67.86 ml and 56.64 ml. 7 dimer (18 kDa), Nsp8 monomer (21.5 kDa), heterodimer (30.5 kDa) and heterotrimer (39.5 kDa) are all observed. an estimation of protein solution state based on SEC data is shown in the table. the MM of Nsp7 estimated from the Guinier analysis of the SAXS data was 19 kDa. this value is twice the molecular mass (9 kDa) calculated from the sequence of a monomer, suggesting that the protein forms dimers in solution. ical RdRp is capable of synthesizing short oligoribonucleotides (6 residues) both of these proteins were able to synthesize short RNA strands of 6 nucleotides. the polymerase activity of FCoV Nsp8 also required the presence of magnesium ions. new tab de novo RdRp activities of FCoV Nsp8-containing variants. a) Mg2+ concentration influence on the RdRp processivity of his-Nsp8. b) Side-by-side comparison of the polymerase activities. the identity between the SL1 sequences of FCoV and FCoV is ca. 50%. we did not observe significant changes in the processivity compared to using FCoV SL1 as a template, implying that Nsp8 does not exhibit strong preference for template sequences. the electrostatic surface potentials were calculated using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) within the PyMOL APBS tools. both Nsp7 molecules are composed of four -helices forming an antiparallel helix bundle. helix H1 comprises 18 residues, while helix H1 contains only 10 residues. the difference between the two conformations is found identically in both copies of the Nsp7+8 heterotrimer in the asymmetric unit. the difference between the two conformations is found identically in both copies of the Nsp7+8 heterotrimer. sequence alignment of FCoV Nsp7 (a) and Nsp8 (b) with homologues from other coronaviruses.

Nsp7 and Nsp8 had retention volumes of 67.86 ml and 56.64 ml respectively. the estimated MMs (4.9 kDa for Nsp7 and 47.7 kDa for Nsp8) agreed well with the MMs of their cross-linked dimers. Fig 5. SEC of Nsp7, Nsp8, and the Nsp7+8 complex are all observed. an estimation of protein solution state based on SEC data is shown in the table. Fig 6.

Nsp7 was used as a negative control; Nsp8 with 4 mM Mn2+ was also tested. RNA oligonucleotide representing stem-loop 1 of the 3\u2032UTR of the FCoV strain FIPV WSU-79/1146 genome was used as a template. the identity between the SL1 sequences of FCoV and FCoV is ca. 50%. we did not observe significant changes in the processivity compared to using FCoV SL1 as a template. the identity between the SL1 sequences of SARS-CoV and FCoV is ca. 50%. the orientation of the FCoV Nsp8 shaft domain is distinct from that of its counterpart in SARS-CoV. the latter makes the same interactions with Nsp7 as FCoV Nsp8 does with Nsp7I, but the second Nsp7 molecule is lacking in the hexadecameric SARS-CoV complex. te Velthuis et al. showed that Nsp8 of SARS-CoV with authentic N terminus is capable of extending primed RNA templates. we conclude that Nsp8 is not simply a primase that provides primers for Nsp12 but that it also executes its own polymerase function and associated roles in coronavirus replication and transcription. Nsp8 and the Nsp7+8 complex exhibit much stronger polymerase processivity. this suggests that at different stages of replication and transcription, different Nsp8-containing variants may be required as de novo RdRps. the proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins and the assembly of the replication complex might be critical for regulating virus replication and transcription. a hexahistidine tag or large additional sequences seem to cause a loss of function in terms of polymerase processivity. we do not have a good explanation for the apparent influence of residues at the N terminus of Nsp8, since a structure of free Nsp8 is not available. fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrate that fluorophor-labeled Nsp8 undergoes significant conformational changes upon addition of RNA. therefore, it is important to perform more biochemical and structural studies on the Nsp8-RNA interaction."}
