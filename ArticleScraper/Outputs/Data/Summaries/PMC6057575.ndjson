{"summary": "acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disorder, expresses itself as distinctively self-limiting neurological deficits. this disorder is very similar to other acute demyelinating syndromes, like multiple sclerosis (MS), from the clinical and pathophysiological symptoms presented. however, in the absence of any distinctive biomarker, definite diagnosis becomes challenging. his chest x-ray revealed aberrations, showing bilateral discrete shadowing, similar to atypical pneumonia. he was admitted to respiratory isolation with the provisional diagnosis of bilateral atypical viral pneumonia (H1N1 vs Corona-Virus) no mass effect was observed and a repeat CT-Scan or MRI of the brain and thoraco-lumbar spine was scheduled for 48 hours later. he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with desaturation, most likely arising from the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. white cell count = 13.15, N = 92%, L = 6%, B = 0%, M = 1%, RBC = 4.04, Hb = 13, Hct = 35.9, mcv = 88.9, mch = 32.4, and plt = 314. the results of the cerebrospinal fluid culture and sensitivity revealed no growth and the India ink test returned negative. ischemic character of multiple brain parenchymal infarcts was evident. mild mass effect was visible on the right lateral and 3rd ventricle. no proof of intracerebral bleed or extra-axial fluid collection was seen. sodium = 137 meq, k = 4.1 meq, cl = 98 meq, BUN = 5.14 mmol/L, creatinine = 88 mmol/L, HbA1C = 5.9%, C-reactive proteins = 3.66 mmol/L, Mag = 0.91 mmol/L, calcium = 2.09 mmol/L, T. protein = 71 g/L, S. albumin = 29 g/L, A acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) has been found to more frequently affect prepubertal children, from 8 to 18 years in age, and young adults, with an annual incidence of 0.4-0.8/100,000 of reported cases. symptoms start to present within one to eight weeks, as a reaction to an antigenic challenge. the usual signs include pain in the limbs and neck, focal or generalized seizures, psychosis, aphasia, dysphasia and visual field defects. the patient complained of neck pain, preceded by urine retention, ataxia, facial palsy motor with drooling of saliva from the left side, sensory loss just below the level of the umbilicus. disseminated and multifocal lesions are clearly seen in the white matter implicating the basal ganglia, thalamus, brain stem and spinal cord. these lesions demonstrate the characteristics of edema, inflammation and demyelination. in this study, the right paraventricular, brain stem, basal ganglia and thoracic regions were included. intravenous immunoglobulins (IgG) are given intravenously in doses of 0.4g/kg/day. the availability of intravenous immunoglobulins is the preferred treatment. it is equally effective when compared with plasmapheresis, which is not easily available and is technically more of a challenge. the prognosis of ADEM is good in a substantial number of pre-puberty young patients. in the minority of cases, the patient may suffer a relapse, with a few symptoms, and is therefore termed multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM)"}
