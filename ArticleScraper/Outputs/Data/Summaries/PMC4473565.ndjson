{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) response plays an important role in innate immunity to viruses (1, 2). many cell types produce IFN in response to a viral invasion. IFN acts on neighboring healthy cells to ward off further viral attack. a plethora of cytokines are coproduced with IFN during viral infections. there is no study that investigates the cytokinome effect on the IFN response. cytokines betacellulin (BTC) and IL-17 possess novel characteristics. recombinant human IFN-2a (rIFN-2a) used had a specific activity of 2 108 IU/mg. cytokines were all human recombinant forms obtained from Peprotech and R&D Systems. NF-B response element-linked reporter was constructed as previously described (17); the NF-B element sequence is as follows: CCAAGGGAAACCCCAGGGGAAGGACTTTCTGGGGAAATTCCCA GAAATCCCCGGTGTGTACGGTG. -molecule inhibitor (Calbiochem) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 1 h before adding 1 nM cytokine and were incubated for a further 6 h. total RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse transcription (RT) to generate cDNA. Western blotting was used to assess the effects of the selected panel of cytokines on IFN-stimulated genes. the cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 6 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. the titers of the viruses were as follows: EMCV, 1.5 108 PFU/ml; VSV, 8 108 PFU/ml; RSV, 107 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml; and H1N1, 5,120 hemagglutinin (HA units/ml). the virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at 70\u00b0C until use. cytokine-IFN combinations were added, and the cultures were further incubated for 16 h. the cytokine-IFN combinations were added at appropriate dilution in reduced-serum MEM. recombinant human IFN-2a (rIFN-2a) used had a specific activity of 2 108 IU/mg. cytokines were all human recombinant forms obtained from Peprotech and R&D Systems. IFNB1 promoter sequence is GTAAATGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA Huh-7 cells were treated with 10 M NF-B small-molecule inhibitor (Calbiochem) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 1 h before adding 1 nM cytokine. total RNA was then extracted and subjected to reverse transcription (RT) to generate cDNA. the final results were converted to ratios standard errors of the mean (SEM) of the gene-specific mRNA levels to housekeeping gene mRNA levels. the qPCR was performed in multiplex with Chromo4 DNA engine cycler (Bio-Rad) the titers of the viruses were as follows: EMCV, 1.5 108 PFU/ml; VSV, 8 108 PFU/ml; RSV, 107 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml; and H1N1, 5,120 hemagglutinin (HA units/ml). the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 104 cells per well for 16 h. a label-free cell-based assay was employed to monitor virus-induced cellular changes in real time (19, 20) cells were seeded in electrode strip-coated 96-well electrode-integrated microplates at a density of 3 105 cells per well. after overnight incubation, the cytokine-IFN combinations were added, and the cultures were further incubated for 16 h. human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 responds to all types of IFNs. it expresses receptors for a multitude of cytokines and chemokines. cytokine gene cluster included known IFN and IFN-like cytokines. the cells were transfected with ISRE/GAS-EGFP reporter constructs for 20 h. the cells were treated with a combination of IFN- (10 IU/ml) and 1 nM each member of the cytokinome. after 20 h of additional incubation, the fluorescence intensity was detected using a BD-Pathway cell imager. the highest modulators of the ISRE response were the type III IFNL1 (3.5-fold), IFNB1, BTC, IL-11, and IFN-, with each cytokine eliciting an approximately 2.0-fold increase in reporter activity compared to IFN- alone. the experiments focused on the ability of combinations of various IFNs and cytokines to augment IFN- or IFN- responses. the combined effects of the cytokines IL-11, IL-17F, and BTC on ISRE activation were tested with increasing doses of IFN-. the cytokines themselves were far less potent alone than with the different doses of IFN- (approximately 2-fold over mock treatment) the data shown are mean (and SEM) fold increases in fluorescence activities (pixels) from three independent experiments. IFN- had little effect, but IFN- had a modest effect. highest direct GAS activation was triggered by IFN- or OSM treatment. cytokines BTC, IL-17F, and OSM were able to increase this ISG only up to 2-fold (P 0.01). but these cytokines, and also TNF, LTA, TIMP2, and NTF3, potently upregulated IFIT3 mRNA expression when combined with IFN- at nearly 15-fold. IFNB caused a notable 1,000-fold enhancement of IFN--induced IFIT3 mRNA, followed by IFN-, which Huh-7 cells were treated with cytokines individually or in combination with IFN- (10 IU/ml) for 6 h. quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan primers specific for human IFIT3 and control GAPDH was performed. endogenous IFN- and Stat1 may play a role in the induction of the IFN response by cytokines, such as TNF- (27), we examined IFNB1 mRNA expression in response to various types of IFNs and cytokines. IFNL2 and IL-17 displayed the strongest triggering of IFNB1 mRNA expression, while other IFNs and cytokines had a modest 2-fold effect. quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan primers specific for human IFN- and GAPDH was performed. wild-type (WT) and U3A (Stat1-deficient) fibroblasts were treated with the selected cytokine panel (1 nM) for 6 h. the ability of the cytokine cluster to induce the transcription of the IFNB1 gene was assessed using the IFNB1 minimal promoter-linked luciferase reporter. three of the cytokines, BTC, OSM, and TNF, but not others, were able to induce IFNB1 promoter activity by 2-fold. IFN-induced delay and flattening of the virus release/shedding curve peaks were noted in this technology. at the maximum dose of IFN- used (10 U/ml), there was a smoother decline in the cellular index than in the virus. WISH cells were seeded in a 96-well microplate and then treated with the indicated IFN and cytokine combinations for 16 h. then challenged with EMCV at an MOI of 0.1. the cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and then eluted for optical density quantitation. compared to EMCV, there was no activity of novel cytokines in enhancing IFN activity against VSV in WISH cells. the cells were seeded for overnight incubation in microwell plates precoated with micro-electronic chip electrodes. they were treated with the indicated cytokines and combinations with IFN- and challenged with VSV at an MOI of 1. the cells were treated with cytokines (3 nM) in the presence or absence of IFN- (100 IU/ml) for 16 h. the RNA was extracted and assayed for H1N1 NS1 RNA using RT-qPCR with primers specific for H1N1 NS1. a cell line was transfected with ISRE/GAS response reporter cell-based assays. it responds to all types of IFNs (i.e., types I, II, and III) and it expresses receptors for a multitude of cytokines and chemokines (21\u201325). it is also highly sensitive to IFN when using an IFN response reporter system (17, 26) the cells were treated with a combination of IFN- (10 IU/ml) and 1 nM each member of the cytokinome. after 20 h of additional incubation, fluorescence intensity was detected using a BD-Pathway cell imager. the heat plot represents the clustering of fold increases in fluorescence intensity due to IFN and cytokine combinations compared to IFN treatment alone. Huh-7 cells were transfected with either ISRE-linked or ISRE-mutant (Mut)-linked EGFP reporter constructs. after 20 h of incubation, the cells were treated with 1 nM each selected cluster cytokine in the presence (A) or absence (B) of 10 U/ml IFN-. OSM augmented IFN--mediated activation of GAS from 9-fold to 17-fold in the absence or presence of IFN-. this appears to be lower than ISRE-mediated activation by IFN- (7- to 12-fold; P 0.01). the highest direct GAS activation was triggered by IFN- or OSM treatment. the cytokines IL-11, IL-11, and IL-17F had the ability to directly trigger ISRE by at least 4-fold. IFNL2 did not activate GAS reporter activity. IFNB caused a notable 1,000-fold enhancement of IFN--induced IFIT3 mRNA, followed by IFN-, which caused a 200-fold enhancement of IFN--induced IFIT3 mRNA. the effect of combining cytokines with IFN- on OAS1 mRNA induction was weaker than that on IFIT3 mRNA. the effect of combining cytokines with IFN- on OAS1 mRNA induction was weaker Huh-7 cells were treated with selected cytokines (1 nM) for 6 h. quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan primers specific for human IFIT3 (B) or for human OAS1 (C) was performed. we examined IFNB1 mRNA expression in response to various types of IFNs and cytokines. IFNL2 and IL-17 displayed the strongest triggering of IFNB1 mRNA expression. other IFNs and cytokines had a modest 2-fold effect. at1-deficient) fibroblasts treated with selected cytokine panel (1 nM) for 6 h. quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan primers specific for human IFN- was performed. results were normalized to human GAPDH levels. the ability of the cytokine cluster to induce the transcription of the IFNB1 gene was assessed using the IFNB1 minimal promoter-linked luciferase reporter. three of the cytokines, BTC, OSM, and TNF, but not others, were able to induce IFNB1 promoter activity by at least 2-fold. the NF-B inhibitor was also able to reduce the ability of the cluster cytokines to induce IFNB1 mRNA IFN-induced delay and flattening of the virus release/shedding curve peaks were noted in this technology. at the maximum dose of IFN- used (10 U/ml), there was a dramatic change in the onset of virus effect and curve kinetics with a smoother decline in the cellular index than in the virus. cytokine combinations for 16 h followed by EMCV challenge at an MOI of 0.1. the cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and then eluted for optical density (OD) quantitation. the data are percent CPE from triplicate readings from one representative experiment out of two. the cells were seeded for overnight incubation in microwell plates precoated with micro-electronic chip electrodes. the cells were treated with the indicated cytokines and combinations with IFN- and challenged with VSV at an MOI of 1. the cell index, representing live-cell activity in relation to time postinfection, is presented as means SEM from triplicate wells. a human respiratory disease virus, influenza virus H1N1, was evaluated here using a relevant cellular model, the A549 lung cell line. we chose a sensitive viral-RNA measurement rather than a cell-based assay because IFN has weak activity against H1N1 due to its IFN-antagonistic NS1-mediated activity. the Huh-7 cell line is a well-established human hepatocyte-derived liver cell line model. it responds to all types of IFNs and to many cytokines and chemokines. it is susceptible to several viruses, including liver and respiratory viruses. autocrine IFN- upon binding to IFNR requires Stat1 and activates IRF7, leading to augmentation of IFN- gene expression. this is not unexpected, because reporter studies address only one regulatory component\u2014transcription. NF-B signaling is an important signaling pathway in cytokine action. IL-17F is a cytokine that is released from dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells (37) it has been shown to possess anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity in liver cells and enhances IFN- action (38, 39) cytokinome study extended these findings by showing OSM individual and combined effects on ISRE- and GAS-linked expression. the IFN biosensor assay is based on real-time monitoring of the change in electric impedance allowing sensing of cellular activity. it made detailed observations, such as the effective dose at any given time point, e.g., the ED30, ED50, and ED95, and the time until CPE at any desired percentage of intact cells. the enhancing effect of the cytokines on IFN is dependent not only on the virus but also on the cell type. pp_89_14_7108__index.html (811B, html)."}
