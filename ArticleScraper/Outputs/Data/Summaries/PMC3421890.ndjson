ATP hydrolysis assay. nM nsp13, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol at 30\u00b0C for 20 min. gels were scanned in a phosphorimager and quantitated by imageQuant. assays were carried out in three independent experiments. results were analyzed in Lineweaver-Burk graphs. a DNA substrate with a 3\u2032-end primer is annealed with a complementary strand at the 5\u2032 end. primer extension can take place only in the presence of a polymerase with strand displacement activity, such as KF. the presence of a dsDNA chelator such as Pico green will prevent strand displacement. a 1 final concentration of Pico green reagent was incubated with 50 nM dsDNA (31/18-mer) in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. fluorescence intensity was measured 2 min after the start of incubation. total intracellular RNA was extracted at 48 h posttransfection (hpt) the extracted RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of N gene mRNA synthesis (NC) the reverse primer URB-28630RS (5\u2032-TGCTTCCCTCTGCGTAGAAGCC-3\u2032), complementary to nucleotides 511 to 532 of the N gene. the mean value for each sample was normalized to the mean value for the NRC-transfected cells by using the following equation: CT = CT(sample) CT(NRC). the RQ value for each sample was then normalized to the RQ value for the NRC (which is 1) in order to obtain percent relative RQ values. reaction samples were analyzed in a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a phosphorimager (FLA 5000; FujiFilm) we assessed the effects of the inhibitor on cellular viability by using a commercially available kit. 7.5 105 cells/well of HEK 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates. the cells were maintained in a final volume of 2 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and 50 g/ml penicillin G and streptomycin. fluorescence signals were detected at 520 nm (with excitation at 495 nm) to assess the quality of this assay, we determined the z factor to be 0.66 under our experimental conditions. a dsDNA substrate (forked substrate) was designed with 2 chromophores at the ends of the complementary strands (i.e., fluorescein and black hole quencher) nsp13 was incubated in presence of 20 M inhibitor compound, 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 0.01% BSA, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, and 5 mM MgCl2. reaction was quenched with 100 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 20% glycerol. the data were fit to dose-response curves by using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Inc.) to determine the IC50 (mean standard deviation [SD]. nsp13 can unwind dsRNA and dsDNA equally well (2). 50 EC50 for SARS-CoV replicon (in RT-qPCR) 8.95 0.86 CC50 >250 a IC50s were determined from the replicon cell-based assay. all values were obtained by using a dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Inc.) nsp13 inhibition by SSYA10-001 is noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and the nucleic acid substrate. nsp13 inhibition by SSYA10-001 is noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and the nucleic acid substrate. nsp13 (25 nM) was preincubated with various concentrations of SSYA10-001. reaction samples were then analyzed in a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. SSYA10-001 does not chelate double-stranded nucleic acids. a gel-based primer extension-strand displacement assay performed with and without SSYA10-001. we then performed a primer extension assay with and without SSYA10-001. the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (KF) has both polymerase and strand displacement activities. SSYA10-001 does not prevent KF from performing its polymerization and strand displacement activities. the SARS-CoV replicon and the NRC were cloned into a pBAC plasmid which contained a cytomegalovirus promoter. various concentrations of SSYA10-001 were added to the NRC-transfected cells. no difference was observed between the amounts of RNA synthesized in the presence and absence of SSYA10-001. HEK 293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with SSYA10-001. total RNA was isolated at 48 h posttransfection and analyzed by RT-qPCR. the average N gene mRNA quantity for each concentration was normalized internally. SSYA10-001 was evaluated for its effect on cell viability. hek 293T cells were incubated with various concentrations of SSYA10-001 for 48 h. no cytotoxicity was observed for SSYA10-001 at 250 M. fluorescence signals were detected at 520 nm (with excitation at 495 nm) a dsDNA substrate was designed with 2 chromophores at the ends of the complementary strands. an active helicase will separate the two strands, and a fluorescence signal will be observed as a result of photon emission from the fluorescein chromophore. 3,000 compounds were screened from the Maybridge HitFinder chemical library. we selected only two compounds that suppressed fluorescence by >50%. positive hits may include compounds that affect fluorescence of fluorescein. the reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. the reaction was quenched with 100 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 20% glycerol. the products were separated and analyzed by 6% nondenaturing PAGE. SSYA10-001 had similar IC50s for the inhibition of nsp13's unwinding activity on dsRNA (31/18-mer), dsDNA (31/18-mer), and SARS-CoV-specific dsRNA (IC50s of 5.70, 5.30, and 5.60 M, respectively). nsp13 inhibition is specific for the SARS-CoV helicase. SSYA10-001 did not cause inhibition of RNA and DNA polymerases. experiments were performed three times, and error bars represent standard deviations for three independent experiments. nsp13 inhibition by SSYA10-001 is noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and the nucleic acid substrate. p13 were conducted in 96-well plates by using a fluorescence-based assay. the x axis intercept (1/Km for the ATP or forked substrate) was not affected by the inhibitor concentration. SSYA10-001 does not prevent DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis by nsp13. forked substrate in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol at 30\u00b0C for 20 min. reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. SSYA10-001 does not chelate double-stranded nucleic acids. the fluorescence counts from Pico green interaction with the dsDNA did not change with increasing concentrations of SSYA10-001. to eliminate the possibility of SSYA10-001 inhibiting RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) or the CMV promoter, various concentrations of SSYA10-001 were added to the NRC-transfected cells. the average raw CT count for the SARS-CoV replicon without compound was 21, compared to an average of 28 for the NRC before normalization to the CT count of U6 (18). the amount of DNA amplified from the replicon was 100-fold in excess over the amount of DNA amplicon amplified from the NRC. HEK 293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with the SARS-CoV replicon or a nonreplicative construct by using Lipofectamine 2000. total RNA was isolated at 48 h posttransfection.

SSYA10-001 is specific for SARS-CoV helicase inhibition. SSYA10-001 may also inhibit several coronaviruses that cause human disease, including but not limited to HCoV-229E and NL63. further studies are under way to evaluate these predictions."}
