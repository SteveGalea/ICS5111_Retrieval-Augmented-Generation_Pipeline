{"summary": "reassortment of genomic segments between different influenza A viruses can result in the emergence of antigenically new viruses, which may spread pandemically (1, 2). the constantly changing nature of influenza viruses also compromises the efficacy of currently available antivirals, because the viruses can rapidly acquire resistance-conferring mutations. TMPRSS2 activates HA upon directed (9, 10) and upon endogenous expression in cell culture. protease is expressed in viral target cells in the human respiratory tract. polymorphisms in the TMPRSS2 promoter were found to be associated with the severity of influenza in humans. TMPRSS11A cleaves and activates FLUAV HA and MERS coronavirus spike protein. endogenous TMPRSS11A is expressed in trachea, a target of FLUAV infection. HA activation by TMPRSS2 but not TMPRSS11A is repressed by HAI-1. zymogen form (46\u201348-kDa amino acid chain, up to three N-glycans) was observed. modest signals potentially corresponding to N-terminal auto-activation products were detected for HAT and DESC1. however, relative signal intensities varied between experiments. expression plasmids encoding HA, the indicated proteases or empty plasmid (pCAGGS) and hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1) were transiently cotransfected into 293T cells. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. coexpression of TMPRSS11A resulted in cleavage of both HA proteins tested. no cleavage was observed in cells coexpressing TMPRSS11B. TMPRSS11A can cleave and activate FLUAV HA of different subtypes. expression plasmids encoding the influenza HA (H1 left panel and H3 right panel) and the indicated proteases or empty plasmid (pCAGGS) were transiently expressed in 293T cells. cells were then treated with PBS or trypsin. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. furin in virus-producing cells (28, 29) can be activated by furin (29) and endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B and cathepsin L (30, 31), (CatB/CatL) during entry into target cells. coexpression of HAT and DESC1 resulted in cleavage of MERS-S. similar activities were detected for TMPRSS11A but not TMPRSS11B. cell lines were preincubated with 10 m of the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL 28170 or DMSO. cell lines were preincubated with empty plasmid (pCAGGS) the protease activity in the cell lysates was determined. analysis of commercially available cDNA panel revealed no appreciable expression of TMPRSS11A mRNA in brain, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, placenta, skeletal muscle, and lung. TMPRSS11A mRNA was readily detectable in the trachea, and tracheal tissues also contained TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 transcripts. thus, TMPRSS11A jointly with functionally redundant proteolytic enzymes single NP-positive cells were detected in tracheal epithelium (Fig. 5, A\u2013C) the vast majority of tracheal epithelial cells expressed Tmprss11a (Fig. 5, D\u2013F), providing further evidence this protease could contribute to viral spread in the infected host. activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1), previously shown to inhibit activity of TTSP members, matriptase (33) and prostasin (34), also blocks HA activation by HAT/DESC proteases. the effect of directed HAI-1 expression in 293T cells on HA cleavage was examined. TTSPs were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases. the results were confirmed in two separate experiments with different plasmid preparations. TMPRSS11A activates influenza A virus hemagglutinin. products were detected for HAT and DESC1 (21\u201322-kDa amino acid chain, up to two N-glycans for all proteases tested) no such signals were consistently detected for TMPRSS11B. intracellular FACS confirmed that all proteases examined were expressed in transfected 293T cells and could thus be subjected to further analysis. the cleavage of HA was determined by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. the results of a single blot from which irrelevant lanes were removed are presented. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. HA cleavage was examined by immunoblot using anti-FLUAV polyclonal antibodies. TMPRSS11A resulted in cleavage of both HA proteins tested. no cleavage was observed in cells coexpressing HA and TMPRSS11B. cleavage was detected by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. the results of single blots from which irrelevant lanes were cut out are shown. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. TMPRSS11A cleaves and activates the MERS-CoV spike protein. similar activities were detected for TMPRSS11A but not TMPRSS11B. expression plasmids encoding MERS-S equipped with a V5 antigenic tag were transfected into 293T cells. c.p.s., counts/s. MERS-S, MERS-coronavirus spike protein. TMPRSS11A is expressed in trachea We next sought to investigate whether endogenous TMPRSS11A could promote FLUAV spread. TMPRSS2 and/or TMPRSS4 expression was detected in some organs. tracheal tissues also contained TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 transcripts. TMPRSS11A could activate FLUAV for spread in tracheal epithelium. single NP-positive cells were detected in tracheal epithelium (Fig. 5, A\u2013C) the vast majority of tracheal epithelial cells expressed Tmprss11a (Fig. 5, D\u2013F) this protease could contribute to viral spread in the infected host. coexpression of HAI-1 interfered with HA cleavage by HAT and DESC1 but not TMPRSS11A. treatment with camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor previously found to be active against TMPRSS2 (30, 31), blocked viral spread promoted by all three proteases. expression of TTSPs was analyzed by western blotting using a mAb specific for the c-Myc tag. results were confirmed in two separate experiments with different plasmid preparations. it has long been believed that HA proteins with monobasic cleavage sites are activated by secreted proteases (35) TTSPs are synthesized as zymogens and can be activated upon autoproteolytic cleavage at a site located between protease domain and stem region (37). bands with a molecular weight expected for zymogen forms and N-terminal products of autocatalytic processing were indeed observed for most proteases. TMPRSS11A activates diverse HA proteins and is expressed in trachea. mRNAs encoding other HA-activating proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, were expressed in trachea. mRNAs encoding other HA-activating proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, were expressed in trachea. TMPRSS11A autoactivation and HA activation were insensitive to HAI-1, a serine protease inhibitor expressed to high levels in stomach, pancreas, uterus, and liver. TMPRSS11A autoactivation and HA activation were insensitive to HAI-1, a serine protease inhibitor expressed to high levels in stomach, pancreas, uterus, and liver. TTSP are differentially susceptible to cellular protease inhibitors. cell tropism may be determined by TTSP expression but also by expression of protease inhibitors. both viruses were propagated in the cavity of embryonated hen eggs. plasmids encode human TMPRSS11A isoform 2 identical to amino acid sequence deposited in geneBankTM entry AAI11797.1. 293T cells seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 2.8 105 cells/well were transfected with plasmids encoding proteases equipped with an N-terminal c-Myc tag. the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 48 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. after 30 min of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2.8 105 cells/well. cells were then cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLUAV HA. expression of MERS-S was detected by staining with a mouse mAb reactive against the C-terminal V5 tag. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLUAV HA cleavage by HAI-1. the cells were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis. the cells were incubated for 24 h after 1 h of incubation. the cells were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-FLUAV (Millipore), followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-goat HRP antibodies (Dianova), and a 10-min incubation with True Blue substrate (KPL). RNA samples were first reverse-transcribed into cDNA as described above. commercially available RNAs and cDNAs originating from various human tissues were purchased from Amsbio, BioChain, Clontech, and TaKaRa. plasmid standards ranging from 1 to 1,000,000 copies/reaction for each target were analyzed in parallel to define the limit of detection. copy numbers for samples that did not yield signals above the LOD were set as 0. Reactions in which water instead of sample/plasmid standard was used served as negative controls. Tmprss11a-positive cells were identified by immunohistochemistry with anti-TMPRSS1A antibody. peroxidase activity was revealed using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) influenza A viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) were reconstituted from previously described 8-plasmid systems (45, 46) both viruses were propagated in the chorio-allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated hen eggs. the eggs were chilled overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and the allantoic fluid was harvested. expression plasmid for TMPRSS11A with an N-terminal c-Myc tag was generated by PCR using the above-mentioned plasmid as a template. the resulting plasmids encode human TMPRSS11A isoform 2 identical to the amino acid sequence deposited in GenBankTM entry AAI11797.1. expression of -actin, detected with anti-actin antibody (Sigma), served as a loading control. a self-made ECL Western blotting solution was used to detect bound antibodies. 293T cells were transiently transfected with TTSP-encoding plasmids. after 30 min of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS. expression of MERS-S was detected by staining with a mouse mAb reactive against the C-terminal V5 tag (Invitrogen), followed by incubation with an HRP-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dianova) 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLUAV H1 hemagglutinin. the transfection medium was replaced by fresh medium after an overnight incubation. cells were incubated with infection medium (DMEM) containing A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at an m.o.i. of 0.01 or 0.1 or A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) at an m.o.i. of 0.1. expression plasmids encoding MERS-S, MLV gag-pol and a firefly-luciferase harboring MLV vector were transiently cotransfected into 293T cells. at 16 h post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium. at 48 h post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested, passed through 0.45-m filters, aliquoted, and stored at 80 \u00b0C. g of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III first-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific). commercially available RNAs and cDNAs originating from various human tissues were purchased from Amsbio, BioChain, Clontech, and TaKaRa. the original stock of PR8M was obtained from Stefan Ludwig, university of M\u00fcnster. the original stock was amplified by infection of 10-day-old embryonated hen eggs for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. ethics statement All experiments in mice were approved by an external committee according to the national guidelines of the animal welfare law in Germany. the protocol used in these experiments was reviewed by an ethics committee."}
