Savidis et al. combined RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to verify that AXL Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL), RAB5C, EBOV caused 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and liberia. the EBOV contains a 19 kb single-stranded RNA genome. it encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24 and RNA-dependent polymerase (L) in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly through the world. a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the disease pathogen. it harbors a large genomic RNA with 2 large ORFs, 1a and 1b, encoding viral replicase/transcriptase. a 3\u2032-NCR is one of the main pathogens causing chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas. people infected with HCV can become chronic carriers [188]. the NIrD system was developed for mammalian cell genome editing. EBOV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza virus often cause acute disease. a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen to identify genes essential for flavivirus infection. the most important target is a subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complexes involved in deNV and ZIKV replication. ostosin Glycosyltransferase 1 (EXT1) and endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC) are important in DENV and ZIKV infection at different life cycle stages. et al. developed a detection platform named Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) to discriminate specific strains of DENV and ZIKV. chimpanzee adenovirus 3 vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine (rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP) have not expanded to phase 3 because of the number of EVD patients declined. a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide was identified to inhibit EboV infection in cells [203]. interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM) also play a restriction role in Filoviruses, SARS-CoV and Influenza virus entry. other host proteins, such the tetraspanin CD9 was found to form a complex with CD26 for early, efficient MERS-CoV entry. cRISPR/SpCas9 system targets replication initiator protein gene of bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), which introduced virus resistance. they also adjusted Cas9 and gRNA expression with the levels of virus suppression and demonstrated that higher expression levels of Cas9 resulted in no obvious viral symptoms. there is no data available regarding how the mammalian immune system responds to CRISPR-Cas apparatus. if various effects from proteins such as SpCas9, Sa-Cas9, dCas9 and CPF1 induce cross-reactive antibodies or T cell responses is unknown. the best method of delivery is transient expression of Cas protein:gRNAs or Cas mRNA:gRNA to cells. in vitro expression of Cas protein and transcription of gRNA costs labor, work and money. lentiviral vector mediated CRISPR-Cas delivery has been widely used for gene targeting in both dividing and non-dividing cells. AAV6 was reported to transduce primary T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic cells. in addition, AAV8 and 9 have been used to deliver Cas9/gRNAs to modify disease-causing mutations in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. this suggests the in vivo potential of Cas9 delivery by AAV. multiple sgRNAs should be combined to target both viral genome and host factors. one day this may lead to designed, personalized sgRNAs to induce a CRISPR-Cas system targeting sequenced viral genomes quickly, easily and efficiently. the lack of target gene should not affect normal physiological function in cells. the lack of target gene should not affect normal physiological function in cells. the safety and efficiency of delivering reagents is another technical concern. e-defective lentivirus could be a valuable choice because of the transient expression. the packaging size is less than 4.7 kb of single-stranded DNA. it leaves little space for inserting other genetic elements when infusing SpCas9. researchers should try to find more host factors involved in the virus life cycle and offer more targets for CRISPR-Cas editing. based targeting of host genes represents an alternative solution for virus related disease treatment for future applications."}
