{"summary": "TIM-1 mediates Glycoprotein-Independent Entry of a Broad Spectrum of Enveloped Viruses. this process requires the binding of PtdSer incorporated in the virus envelope to TIM-1, allowing for virus internalization independent of a viral envelope protein. there is a pressing need for new tools to investigate influenza virus pathogenesis. FI16 recognizes the latent EBV genome in EBV latency I (Burkitt's lymphoma), II (nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and III (B-lymphoblastoid) cells. cleaved caspase-1, IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 are released in LMP-1-positive exosomes of infected cells. MHV infection activates the OAS-RNase antivir at least 5% of the bat genome is occupied by ERVs or remnants. lineage-specific proviral integrations were identified for all major ERV classes."}
