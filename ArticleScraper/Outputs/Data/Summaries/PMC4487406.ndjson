{"summary": "in this review, we will focus on the present problems of the emerging antimicrobial resistance of many pathogenic bacteria as well as spread of viral infections. we will discuss the possible druggability of the bacterial toxins\u2013antitoxins family of proteins as well as the pros and cons of these approaches. the global figure of people suffering from microbial infections may reach the hundreds of millions. this poses huge ethical, medical and economical concerns. the current portfolio of compounds in clinical trials includes mostly derivatives of existing antibiotics for which resistance mechanisms already exist. the number of industries working on active discovery and development programs for antibacterial agents has dropped in the last 20 years from more than 20 companies to only 4 in 2013. most large pharmaceutical companies have stopped investing in new antibiotic research and development programs. the number of antibacterials attained a peak by the end of the 1990s and decreased very fast afterwards. the withdrawal of companies from the antibacterial drug market has led to the reduced number of new drugs approved by the US-FDA. the \u201810 20\u2019 initiative, launched in 2010 to promote the development of 10 new antibiotics by 2020 has resulted in only two new molecules. the current market-based system does not have the capacity to supply a sudden demand of vaccine when pandemic is declared. the antiviral, like influenza, is likely still effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of disease caused by a new pandemic virus. we can envisage some variants of classical alternatives, such as (i) development of chemical derivatives of the known antibiotics by chemical modification of the active molecule; (ii) alternate use of available antibiotics. more novel approaches include (i) development of entirely novel classes of antibiotics; (ii) the use of new small molecules as antivirulence or antipersisters drugs. novel strategies Novel strategies Chemical derivatives of the known antibiotics Antibiotic cycling or rotation Collateral sensitivity Biologic approaches Novel small molecules - Phage therapy - Antivirulence - Vaccines - Antipersisters - Peptides Search for essential genes as targets Search for novel targets - Virulence factors - TAs Change antibiotic treatment until new resistance appears Target the spread of abR - Mobilome: conjugation inhibitors (COINS) TAs are usually composed of two genes: the toxin gene encodes a toxin protein that has toxic effect to the cells. the antitoxin can be either RNA or protein, which counteracts the toxicity of its cognate toxin. TAs have been grouped into five types so far. type II TAs consists of two genes organized as an operon. the antitoxin gene precedes the toxin one. both genes are co-transcribed from a promoter located upstream of the antitoxin gene. the antitoxin protein is not able to bind to the promoter by itself. it serves as a co-repressor upon binding of the antitoxin to the promoter. toxins that share similar structures, despite no notable sequence similarities, bind to different targets. 12 toxin superfamilies and 20 antitoxin superfamilies have been identified. the number of the TA genes that we know up to date seems to be still below the actual number. aTarget not determined ROLE OF TYPE II TAs has been identified. aTarget not determined ROLE OF TYPE II TAs has been identified. TAs operons can reside on chromosomes, on plasmids or on both, in single or multiple copies. plasmid-encoded TAs were believed to only function in exerting post-segregational killing of daughter cells that do not inherit the parental plasmid. chromosomally encoded TAs protect the cells against PSK mediated by the plasmid-encoded TA homologues. the chromosomally encoded TAs have been suggested to be involved in at least the following processes. the toxicity is reversible when a normal environment is restored. a number of biotechnological applications have been proposed and successfully developed for commercial purposes. in this instance, Escherichia coli strains harbour plasmid vectors expressing the lethal toxin gene product, which is counteracted by expression of the cognate antitoxin in trans. other applications include the controlled release of genetically modified organisms into the biosphere. TAs as ANTIVIRALS Among the anti-infective drugs recently approved for clinical use, the antiviral agents have been the more numerous. over 40 antivirals have been licensed, more than half of them being used in the treatment of infections by herpes virus, hepatitis (B and C) and influenza. Tat is produced early after HIV-1 infection and binds to the transactivation response (TAR) sequence, inducing the subsequent expression of other HIV-1 proteins. mazF gene contains nine ACA sequences, which were engineered to avoid self-cleavage without altering the amino acid sequence and maintained its toxicity. mazF gene was engineered to avoid self-cleavage by changing the base sequences but conserving its amino acid sequence to preserve its toxicity to cleave the viral mRNAs. the vector was then transduced into human T lymphoid line CEM-SS cells. the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA (2). non-structural serine protease, NS3\u20134A, is an HCV protein that is essential for the HCV replication. other viral protease cleavage sites worked the same with their corresponding proteases. TYPE II TAs as TARGETS FOR ANTIBACTERIAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT. potential targets for development of novel antibacterials could be making use of the toxins of the bacterial TA genes. some toxin homologues were also identified in silico in fungi. culosis contains at least 30 functional TA genes (88 putative TA gene pairs were tested) the number of TA genes reported so far can be a serious underestimation of the real figure in the microbial world. a more thorough way to identify functional TA genes was done via shotgun cloning. the toxins of the TA pairs as all novel targets to be considered for drug discovery must comply with a set of requirements, such as lack of toxicity to eukaryotic cells and target only the infecting bacteria. the toxins of the TA pairs as all novel targets to be considered for drug discovery must comply with a set of requirements, such as lack of toxicity to eukaryotic cells. toxins from TAs act as endoribonucleases that cleave mRNAs associated or not to translating ribosomes, independently of the mRNA origin, prokaryotic or eukaryotic. the toxin could act as an antitumoural agent and could be used as an efficient anti-cancer compound. if the toxins have to be delivered directly to the patients, the adverse effect of the toxin on the normal commensal flora and the human cells could also be difficult to avoid. the more efficient approaches would include the more specific targeting of the pathogens, or the bacteria that harbour TAs by triggering the release of the toxins. yogenes is bactericidal for the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and bacteriostatic for the Gram-negative E. coli. toxin HipA inhibits aminoacylation and it is counteracted by its cognate antitoxin HipB which, in turn, is degraded by Lon protease. formation of persisters was shown to be modulated by the signalling nucleotide pppGpp through a cascade involving inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP), Lon protease and TAs. polyP competitively inhibits exopolyphosphatase from degrading PolyP. this would lead to the release of toxins that eventually would promote inhibition of cellular biosynthesis. antitoxin MqsA is a global regulator that can repress the expression of CsgD. it leads to reduction of the signalling nucleotide c-di-GMP, curli production. biofilm also raises problem by forming a host for the survival of persisters. a specific bioluminiscence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay was developed to test libraries of peptides that could disrupt the T:A interfaces. a specific bioluminiscence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay was developed to test libraries of peptides that could disrupt the T:A interfaces. peptides designed based on antitoxin sequences were able to disrupt the T:A interface, but the toxicity of the toxin was also reduced. peptides designed based on toxin sequence to bind to antitoxin would be a better approach. i-PPI is based on the efficient resonance energy transfer between a bioluminescent donor moiety and a fluorescent acceptor moiety. the bioluminescent Renilla luciferase catalyses the coelenterazine substrate to coelenteramide with concomitant light emission at 480 nm. if interactions between the toxin and antitoxin proteins are disrupted by i-PPI, RLUC and EYFP afenib (a drug for metastatic melanoma) in only six years. several groups in the uk have joined to develop the 3D Fragment Consortium (http://www.3DFrag.org) devoted to building a shared library (500\u20133000 fragments) protein interfaces, such as protein crystallography to elucidate the 3D protein structure, molecular docking, virtual screening and approaches to design novel drug libraries should prove useful for these purposes. development of novel databases to assist the finding and design of novel i-PPIs should prove useful for these purposes. antitoxin is more susceptible to degradation by the host proteases than its cognate toxin. by inhibiting the replenishment of the antitoxin, the toxin will be released and can exhibit its toxicity to the cells while its cognate antitoxin is degraded. we can conceive a number of strategies, all having their pros and cons. a mutant of the antitoxin with enhanced DNA binding affinity could be used. this could be achieved as the binding site of the antitoxin to the DNA is at the N-terminal moiety whereas to its cognate toxin is at the C-terminus. the challenge would be the binding affinity, as the antitoxins are, in general, weak repressors. antisense antibacterial strategies had been developed since two decades ago by continuous refining of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) to silence essential genes at mRNA/DNA levels. unmodified RNA/DNA is labile and prone to degradation by nucleases. oligomers mimic the nucleic acid structure, with one end attached to a short peptide. these compounds mimic the nucleic acid structure, with one end attached to a short peptide. a third approach could be to target proteases that cleave the antitoxin. mazEF TA is a widespread TA among many bacteria, many of them pathogenic. this involves triggering of the TA from outside by extracellular death factor (EDF), a short peptide that acts as a quorum sensor. this strategy might be enough as a starting point to develop a novel antibacterial that, however, would activate only this particular TA. drug delivery research necessitates interdisciplinary collaborations at a national and international level. delivery of sensitive drugs such as peptides, nucleic acid-based therapeutics, simple and complex carbohydrates, and synthetic vaccines presents a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry. minicells are produced by bacteria defective in cell division. they lack chromosomal DNA, but plasmids do segregate into them. plasmids in minicells synthesize de novo the products they encode. de novo protein synthesis by minicells has been successfully used to characterize plasmid-encoded proteins, including TAs. cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are peptides that can be internalized by energy-free mechanisms not well understood yet. a fragment-based drug design to deal with the disruption of the TAs interactions seems to be one of the most likely approaches to develop TAs as good candidates to enter into the antibacterial pipeline. an exciting alternative to explore is the employment of antisense small RNA. if we could conceive such a scenario, novel avenues will open to explore real novel drugs. the authors declare no competing financial interests."}
