{"summary": "photolyases (PHR) are evolutionarily related flavoproteins. they are activated by light and repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. cryptochromes share structural similarity with DNA photolyases. circadian rhythmicity is a 24-hour cycle of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes. it was found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [7]. a circadian clock system consists of a central oscillator, input and output pathways. the central oscillator resides in the brain, which controls the circadian behavior of the whole organism. conserved domains were identified by the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) tool [19]. the conserved domains are absent in the CRY-DASH and photolyase proteins. deletion of the C-terminus prevents mammalian CRY from negatively regulating the transcription of other circadian components. photolyases also have two cofactors, one of them is FAD. another can be 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF) the 3D-architectures of the photolyase/cryptochrome superfamily members are similar. Xenopus laevis (NP_001081421), Drosophila melanogaster (NP_724274), Monosiga brevicollis (XP_001747506), Arabidopsis thaliana (NP_566520) and Verticillium albo-atrum (XP_003006428) for CRY-DASH. soma linguale CRY-DASH YP_003390944 and Geobacter sulfurreducens CPD Class II PHR NP_953872. a total of 762 sequences were selected for the analysis. RNA polymerase subunit RPB2 was used for the comparative taxonomical analysis. phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the protein sequences. the most appropriate model of amino acid substitutions for the data set was determined according to the Akaike information criterion. substitutions were used to measure the strength of selection on the CRY/PHR genes. the set of tests was conducted: (1) the basic model (M0), which estimates uniform ratio among all sites, was used to calculate a representative estimate for the whole dataset [38]. CP5 was inferred from the study of three genes (rbcL, atpB, 18S rDNA) in 560 angiosperms, which estimated the origin time of Angiospermae between 179 and 158 Mya [50]. CP6 is the origin of Ascomycota about 500\u2013650 Mya [51]. DNA and protein sequences of CRY and PHR were retrieved from the GenBank. only the sequences from fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes were used for the analyses. a total of 762 sequences were selected for the analysis. RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2 was used for the comparative taxonomical analysis. the taxonomical analysis involved smaller number of species (206) the aligned sequences were trimmed manually in Bioedit v.7.0.9 [29] by removing poorly aligned terminal regions. the final alignment of the CRY/PHR and RBP2 proteins included 489 and 1172 positions, respectively. we analyzed positive selection using the ML approach. the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was used to measure the strength of selection on the CRY/PHR genes. the analysis was conducted using the Bayesian algorithm and the LG model. the same sequence alignment used in DIVERGE v.2.0 was uploaded to the server. the substitution model for the data was determined by jModelTest v.0.1.1 [53]. we also used the Bayesian relaxed clock as implemented in BEAST v.1.6.2 to estimate the dates of various events in evolution of the superfamily.

estimated (Node11-5) time estimates were shown in Table 3. the phylogenetic tree of the CRY/PHR proteins inferred in the present study was similar to those from the previous studies. the PHR2 subfamily previously reported from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [56] is common in higher plants (S1 and S2 Figs) however, they are absent from all other algae (S1 and S2 Figs) CRY-DASH encodes a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) CPD photolyase. plant PHR2 repairs CPD dimers of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). the ssDNA binding property of CRY-DASH is closely related to its structure. phylogenetic tree indicates that there are two insect Cry paralogs, Cry1 and Cry2. the majority of insects lost photosensitive CRY1 and has only CRY2. it is still unknown how insects lacking CRY1 sense light. a plant-like Cry was identified in D. rerio (XP_009291670) the maximum number of cryptochrome gene copies in other animal taxa (including birds, reptiles and amphibians) is usually 2 or 3. the extra Cry homologs in zebra fish were likely generated by ancient polyploidy events. eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) display circadian rhythms. the input signals to the clock are not always controlled by cryptochromes. eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) display circadian rhythms. fungi are the simplest organisms to exhibit circadian rhythmicity [82]. an environmental signal is transduced to the endogenous clock by the circadian input kinase A (CikA) [83], and the whole circadian system is controlled by the kaiABC gene cluster [84]. there had been no evidence for common ancestor of eukaryotic and prokaryotic circadian genes [85], until it was found that the cryptochromes have a angiosperms are an evolutionary young (179\u2013158 Mya) and species-rich group. the speciation processes were likely followed by episodic diversifying selection in circadian genes. this might imply coevolution of cryptochromes and phytochromes. plant, insect and vertebrate cryptochromes originated in Neoproterozoic Era (1000\u2013541 Mya) during that period, the day length steadily increased from 18 h at 900 Mya [94] to 21 h at 600 Mya [95] and approximately 22 hours at 650\u2013600 Mya [96]. circadian system evolution in eukaryotes is similar to that in prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) [100]. the time estimates for major events in evolution correspond to each other. cyanobacteria lost kaiA, also an important element of the circadian input. the phylogenetic tree of the CRY/PHR proteins inferred in the present study was similar to those from the previous studies [5,11]. the protein subfamilies form several main clades, including animal CRY & (6\u20134) photolyases, CRY-DASH, plant CRY and 2 classes of CPD photolyases (CPD class I and class II) the PHR2 subfamily previously reported from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [56] is common in higher plants. however, they are absent from all other algae (S1 and S2 Figs) CRY-DASH encodes a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) CPD photolyase. plant PHR2 repairs CPD dimers of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). a drosophila-like type 1 CRY is a UV-A/blue light receptor in the circadian oscillator. in plants, circadian clocks are entrained by red light receptor phytochromes (PHY) as well as blue light receptor cryptochromes. the signal transduction pathways were not comprehensively studied. the obtained phylogenetic tree indicates that there are two insect Cry paralogs, Cry1 and Cry2. the majority of insects lost photosensitive CRY1 and has only CRY2. a plant-like Cry was identified in D. rerio (XP_009291670) the maximum number of cryptochrome gene copies in other animal taxa (including birds, reptiles and amphibians) is usually 2 or 3. the extra Cry homologs in zebra fish were likely generated by ancient polyploidy events. animal cryptochromes originated from photolyases, while plant cryptochromes are evolved from CPD photolyases. the origin of animal Cry was accompanied by coevolution of other circadian components including PER, BMAL1, CYC and CLK. the circadian system is controlled by the kaiABC gene cluster. there had been no evidence for common ancestor of eukaryotic and prokaryotic circadian genes. however, it is still unclear what circadian function is performed by CRY-DASH in prokaryotes. angiosperms are an evolutionary young (179\u2013158 Mya) and species-rich group. the speciation processes were likely followed by episodic diversifying selection in circadian genes. this might imply coevolution of cryptochromes and phytochromes. plant, insect and vertebrate cryptochromes originated in Neoproterozoic Era (1000\u2013541 Mya) during that period, day length steadily increased from 18 h at 900 Mya [94] to 21 h at 600 Mya [95] and to approximately 22 hours at 650\u2013600 Mya [96]. the origin of clock genes de novo or co-option of non-circadian genes to perform circadian function is similar to that in prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) [100]. the time estimates for the major events in evolution of cryptochromes and the cyanobacterial circadian system correspond to each other. maximum-likelihood probabilities of the node support below 0.5 are not shown. internal branch marks in blue font correspond to branches evolved under episodic diversifying selection. marks in violet font represent positively selected branches (mean > 1). s, corrected p was the probability obtained after Holm\u2019s correction for multiple testing. infinite mean may be resulted by lack of synonymous substitution."}
