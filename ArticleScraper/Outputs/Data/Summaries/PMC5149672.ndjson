{"summary": "the most common respiratory viruses causing acute lower respiratory tract infection (ARIs) in children under five years of age were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and rhinovirus (RV) besides this, 10%\u201350% of children affected with ARI develop secondary bacterial infections, namely, acute otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia. patients with suspected bacterial etiology, HIV, illness lasting more than a week, severe malnutrition were excluded. PCR or RT-PCRs were performed to detect infection with RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV, adenovirus (aDV), human corona virus (hBoV), enterovirus (EV), and RV. RT-PCR was performed using a superscript II one-step RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit. all products underwent electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. results A total of 358 children of 2\u201360 mo age and acute respiratory infections were screened. auscultatory wheeze was present in 85% and crackles in 82% of LRI cases. Chest X-ray findings were hyperinflation (93%), peribronchial cuffing (60%), interstitial infiltrates (48%), and patchy opacity (46%). the maximum number of cases recruited and samples positive for viruses was in the months of January, December, and August. dominated over RSV-A in LRI cases. PIV-2 and 4, hCoV, and EV were not detected in URI cases. month-wise recruitment of ARI cases and samples positive for viruses. 0 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9 acute URI coinfection types number RV + RSV 9 RV + ADV 7 IFV + PIV 6 RV + IFV 4 PIV + RV 5 RSV + hBoV 3 RSV + hMPV 2 RV + hMPV + hBoV 3 RV + ADV + RSV 1 PIV + ADV + IFV 1 Total 41. RSV was the most common virus detected in age groups of 2\u20136 mo and >6\u201312 mo. hMPV and hBoV were not detected up to 12 mo age. the least common viruses in all age groups were hBoV, hCoV, EV. EV and hCoV 43 were not detected in URIs. there detection rate was lower in LRIs. respiratory viruses were detected in 248 cases (LRI = 142; URI = 106) the most common single viruses isolated from all the ARI cases were RV (32.6%), ADV (19.6%), RSV (17.4%), and IFV-A (15.2). acute LRI cases were RSV (32.4%), IFV-A (19.6%), ADV (18.6%), and RV (15.7%). in URIs, the most common age group affected was >12\u201360 mo. present study results are similar to previous study results from india. URI and LRI prevalence varied with age, URIs being common in children of >12\u201360 mo and LRIs being common in infants of 12 mo age. infants 12 mo age were most commonly positive for RSV and less commonly for IFV, the latter occurring commonly beyond infancy in older children. in acute LRIs, severe clinical phenotypes (severe and very severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome) were more prevalent in case of coinfection with more than one respiratory viruses. of 13 patients who died, 10 were because of coinfection. RV, and IFV were the most prevalent viruses isolated from the ARI cases. the epidemiology of respiratory viruses needs to be studied further."}
