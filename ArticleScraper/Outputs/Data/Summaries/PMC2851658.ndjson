{"summary": "SARS-CoV emerged in the winter of 2002 and infected about 8,000 people globally and resulted in 800 deaths. innate immune response is a key first line of defense against invading pathogens and is dependent on various signaling pathways. innate immune response is a key first line of defense against invading pathogens. IFN antagonist genes encode VP35 which blocks STAT1 signaling[13],[14], influenza NS1 blocks IRF3 activation[15],[16] and V proteins from the Nipah and Hendra viruses induce STAT1 degradation[17]. the role of IFN in regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo is less clear. glass et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV was cleared from the lungs of wildtype C57BL/6 mice and strains that lacked that T, B and NK cells with similar kinetics. STAT1, a key modulator of IFN /, signaling, was required for the resolution of wildtype SARS-CoV infection. IFN/ and IFN receptor knockout mice and 129 WT mice survive SARS-CoV infection. we infected mice with either a late phase SARS-CoV (Urbani) virus or a recombinant isogenic mouse-adapted virus (rMA15) that contained six virulence modifying mutations. the mouse-adapted virus may display more prominent pathogenicity than the Urbani virus. individual mice were infected intranasally with 1105 pfu/ml rMA15 virus. 129 WT, IFNAR1/ and IFNGR/ mice infected with the virus lost 15% of their weight by day 4 and steadily recovered over the next 5 days. IFNAR1/ and IFNGR/ mice showed no increase in susceptibility to rMA15 or urbani virus infection. no increase in virus titer or weight loss was seen compared to 129 WT mice or the single IFN receptor knockout mice. previous studies have suggested that STAT1 / mice do not clear the virus by day 22 post-infection. STAT1/ mice showed higher peak virus titers in the lungs at day 2. rMA15 virus caused denuding bronchiolitis at 2 days post-infection. rMA15 virus caused a denuding bronchiolitis at 2 days post-infection. perivascular cuffing, obstruction of the conducting airways by apoptotic debris and apoptosis of the airway epithelium were rarely observed. by day 9 post-infection, the remaining inflammation caused by rMA15 virus infection was primarily found in peribronchiolar areas. mice were sacrificed at days 2, 5 and 9 post-infection for histopathology. inflammation found in lung sections was temporally related to viral titer. at day 2 post-infection, a denuding bronchiolitis characterized by significant apoptosis and cell death. large foci containing densely packed fibroblasts, macrophages and lymphocytes were seen throughout the lungs. a focal mixed inflammatory infiltrate was found with extensive fibrin deposition. Pleuritis signified by a breakdown of the pleura was seen in most samples as well. at day 9, necrosis was not observed and only minor perivascular cuffing was present. in STAT1/ mice infected with the Urbani virus, there was a similar distribution of bronchial and bronchiolar lesions in the lung as seen in the 129 WT mice at day 3. bronchiolar epithelium had foci of regeneration with little necrosis and perivascular inflammation was less severe than at day 3. a fibrinous peritonitis, pleuritis and pyogranulomatous lesions in spleen, liver and omentum developed as the major lesions that likely contributed to illness and death in the STAT1/ mice. plasma cells became abundant in the splenic and liver lesions by day 24 (Figure S2G, E). in all 4 strains of mice, the probe signal was predominantly localized in the airway epithelial cells at day 2 post-infection. this correlated with the pathologic lesions in airway epithelial cells at day 2 post-infection. by day 9, there was no viral RNA signal in the lungs of 129 WT, and IFNAR1/ mice. we isolated leukocytes from enzymatically disrupted mouse lungs harvested on day 8 post-infection. we used cell surface markers to quantify macrophage (CD11c/CD11b+/GR-1int/MHCII+), neutrophil (F480/CD11b+/CD11c/GR-1+) and eosinophil (CD11c/Siglec+/GR-1) populations in 129 WT and STAT1/ mice. rMA15 infected mice were isolated and labeled with antibodies to identify inflammatory cell populations by flow cytometry. macrophages were identified as CD11c/CD11b+/GR-1int/MHCII+ cells, neutrophils as F480/CD11b+/CD11c/GR-1+ cells and eosinophils as CD11c/Siglec+/GR-1 cells. real-time PCR analysis was performed on RNA from infected mouse lungs. mice were harvested at days 2, 5 and 9 post-infection and lung RNA isolated by Trizol. cDNA was made from 1ug of RNA of each and used in real-time analysis. IFN and MCP1 gene expression levels were similar in rMA15 virus-infected 129 WT, IFNAR1/ and IFNGR-/mice. transcript levels were induced by day 2 and then decreased through day 9. expression levels of IFN and MCP1 continued to increase through day 2. significant differences in cytokine expression patterns were noted between STAT1, WT and IFNAR deficient animals. STAT1/ mice were typified by perceived loss of regulatory control and persistent high level expression. IFNL is minimally but significantly upregulated during infection in WT 129 mice at day 2 post infection. BALB/c and IL28Ra/ mice were infected with 1105 pfu of either Urbani or rMA15 virus. real time analysis of IL28B transcripts was performed on WT 129 infected mice at 2, 5 and 9 days post infection. rMA15 virus infection caused >20% weight loss and/or death by day 4-5 post-infection in BALB/c and similar findings in IL28Ra/ mice. both mice showed peak virus titers at day 2 with a 2-3 log decrease by day 4. Lungs were analyzed at days 2, 4 and 9 post-infection and showed no difference in pathology compared to IFNAR1/ mice. both groups showed epithelial cell denudation at 2 day post-infection and repair and clearance by day 9. this suggests that the inhibition of both Type I and Type III signaling in mice does not increase the pathogenesis of the rMA15 virus. the urbani virus and the equivalent icSARS viruses are not lethal in 10-wk old mice. the rMA15 virus is lethal in 10-wk old mice causing greater than 20% weight loss by 4 days post-infection and death by 4\u20135 days post-infection. d is the average pfu/g of lung for 5 mice per group for each timepoint. 129 WT, IFNAR1/ and IFNGR/ mice infected with rMA15 virus lost 15% of their weight by day 4. titers in the lungs peaked at day 2 post-infection. AT1 protects mice from rMA15 and Urbani virus infection. previous studies have suggested that STAT1 / mice do not clear the virus by day 22 post-infection. STAT1/ mice infected with rMA15 virus were more susceptible to disease. 1/ mice showed increased and sustained virus replication in the lungs as late as 15 days post-infection. virus was detected only through day 5 post-infection in the 129 WT mice. a STAT1-dependent, IFN type I and II receptor-independent pathway plays a key role in regulating viral clearance and survival following SARS-CoV infection. the remaining inflammation caused by rMA15 virus infection was found in peribronchiolar areas. mice were sacrificed at days 2, 5 and 9 post-infection for histopathological analysis. inflammation was evident throughout the lungs and alveoli, resulting in a mild to moderate pneumonitis. at day 9 post-infection, lung lesions in STAT1/ mice were indistinguishable from those in 129 WT, IFNAR1/ and IFNGR/ infected animals. pathology was consistent with proliferative and organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) similar pathologic lesions were seen in many fatal SARS cases [31]\u2013[34]. bronchiolar epithelium had foci of regeneration with little necrosis. by day 5, the bronchiolar epithelium had foci of regeneration with little necrosis. peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation was less severe than at day 3. a blue tinge was noted in the perivascular edema fluid, suggesting early collagen deposition. plasma cells became abundant in the splenic and liver lesions by day 24. abundant fibrosis (detected by Masson's trichrome stain) was seen in the splenic and liver lesions at day 24. lungs of 129 WT, IFNAR1/ and IFNGR/ mice showed no viral RNA signal. RNA signal was lost from the airway epithelial cells in the bronchioles by day 9 in STAT1/ mice. cellular debris can be seen in these foci that represent lysed airway epithelial cells. eosinophil population increased from 2% in 129 WT mice to 30% in STAT1/ mice and neutrophils increased from 3% in 129 WT mice to 35% in STAT1/ mice. also, the number of macrophages in STAT1/ mice was more than double that detected in 129 WT mice. cDNA was made from 1ug of RNA of each and used in real-time analysis. cDNA was made from 1ug of RNA of each and used in real-time analysis. in urbani virus infected lungs, minimal changes were seen in 129 WT, IFNAR1/, IFNAGR/ mice for all 4 cytokines. TNF protein levels increased steadily from day 2 through day 29 post-infection while IL6 and IFN protein levels peaked at day 9. rMA15 virus infected 129 mice with peaks at day 2 that decreased to baseline levels by day 5. IFN, IFN4, IL28B, IL18, IRF1 and OAS1 showed a peek of induction at 2dpi for all 3 strains. the receptor for IFNL is a heterodimer of IL10Rb and IL28Ra. IL28Ra/ mice have been generated on the BALB/c mouse background. rMA15 virus infection of IL28Ra/ mice causes death by day 4 or 5 post-infection. Lungs were homogenized and supernatant of each lung was titered by plaque assay on Vero cells. the level of detection is shown by a dotted line at 100 pfu/ml. there was no weight loss in either BALB/c or IL28Ra/ mice infected with the Urbani virus. both BALB/c and IL28Ra/ mice showed similar high levels of inflammation at 2 and 4 days post-infection, but remarkably similar pathologic outcomes. we found no role for IFN in protection from infection with either the Urbani or rMA15 strains of SARS-CoV. mice were infected with 1105 pfu/ml rMA15 virus at day 0. A. Mock infected (PBS) and antibody injected IFNAR1/ mice were infected with 1105 pfu/ml rMA15 virus at day 0. Mouse lungs were harvested at days 2, 4 and 9 post-infection. all three share a common cytoplasmic signaling protein called STAT1. the protein is translocated to the nucleus and induces expression of multiple, overlapping IFN regulated genes. the same phenotypes are noted in STAT1 / mice, demonstrating a key role of the entire innate immune pathway. the development of triple knockouts affecting all 3 IFN receptors would address this mechanistic possibility. STAT1 functions a key gatekeeper in mediating IFN/, IFN and IFN signaling into the nucleus to induce overlapping but distinct ISGs. STAT1 defects may augment viral lung disease by several potential mechanisms. perivascular cuffing, collapse of alveolar parenchyma, invasion and amplification of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and fibroblasts. pathological findings mirror those seen in ALI, pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS. myd88 / mice showed an enhanced susceptibility to rMA15 virus infection in C57/B6 mice[26] and RAG1/ mice showed no increased morbidity and mortality from rMA15 virus infection. viral replication in the lungs was detectable through 28 days post-infection[26]. the similarities between STAT1/ mice infected with SARS-CoV and elderly individuals infected with SARS-CoV during the epidemic are intriguing. we hypothesize that altered STAT1 signaling in aged individuals may have lead to increased susceptibility to severe disease. the innate immune system plays a central role in regulating early host responses to virus infection. the innate immune system plays a central role in regulating early host responses to virus infection and promoting adaptive immune responses. phenotypes are noted in STAT1 / mice, demonstrating a key role of the entire innate immune pathway in regulating disease severity, viral titers, and pathology[10]. a novel mechanism by which STAT1 function regulates disease severity in the lung following SARS-CoV induced acute lung injury. STAT1 was shown to be an important controller of tumor formation in several types of cancers including lung, colon, pancreatic and brain cancers[46]\u2013[48]. STAT1/ mouse fibroblasts showed increased proliferation when exposed to growth factors compared to WT mouse fibroblasts. STAT1 may regulate wound healing response following acute lung injury. SARS-CoV ORF6 blocks STAT1 nuclear import[18], PLP blocks IRF3 activation[51], NSP7[51], NSP15[51], ORF3b and N have been shown to be IFN antagonists. this suggests that in infected cells, the multiple pathways that inhibit IFN signaling may create essentially a STAT/ environment which may contribute to the further pathology seen during disease. rMA15 virus Infection with the epidemic caused increased pathology in the STAT1/ mice. the pathology results from the host's response to the infection. similar findings were seen in autopsy samples from individuals who died from SARS. we propose a new pathway by which STAT1 regulates end stage lung disease following viral infection. we hypothesize that the increased susceptibility of STAT1/ mice results from different roles of STAT1 in the cell. we hypothesize that the increased susceptibility of STAT1 results from different roles of STAT1 in the cell.
