{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major cellular organelle for protein synthesis, folding, modification, and trafficking. misfolded/unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and cause ER stress. the three primary ER stress sensors are activated by accumulated misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can all induce significant ER stress following infection (17\u201320) viral replication is dependent on the host cell protein-synthetic machinery for producing viral proteins. several recent studies have demonstrated the critical roles of UPR in modulating the innate immune responses. NF-B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitors of NF-B (29) the basal level of IB is maintained by constitutive synthesis and degradation of the protein. TGEV infection induces ER stress in swine testicular cells. we monitored the expression of the major marker (GRP78) of the UPR. the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (Tu) was used as a positive control. TGEV infects and replicates in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. the growth curve of TGEV in IPEC-J2 cells was similar to that in ST cells. TGEV infection triggers ER stress in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells. IRE1 activation promotes endoribonuclease activity of IRE1 that selectively cleaves a 26-nucleotide (nt) segment from XBP1 mRNA and creates the active spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) transcription factor. spliced XBP1s form increased after TGEV infection. d ATF6 (50-kDa protein) gradually increased and peaked at 48 hpi. TGEV infection activates all three UPR signaling pathways in vitro. shown is analysis scheme for XBP1 mRNA splicing. ST cells were infected with H87 at an MOI of 1 and harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi. cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against p-PERK, total PERK, p-eIF2, total eIF2 and the TGEV-N protein. p-PERK and p-eIF2 were similar to the kinetics of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein expression. these results suggest that TGEV infection activates the PERK-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP pathway. Collectively, TGEV infection triggers all three UPR signals in vivo. piglets were orally inoculated with TGEV strain H87 or with DMEM as uninfected controls. all the piglets were euthanized by the end of the study, which was terminated at 48 hpi. TGEV-infected ileum tissues showed an increased ratio of XBP1s to the total XBP1 and elevated mRNA levels of ERdj4 compared with those of the mock control. ire1 is slightly activated in vivo, indicating that TGEV infection in vivo activates all three UPR pathways. 2 cells were pretreated with Tg (1 M), Tu (2 g/ml), 4-PBA, or DMSO carrier control 2 h before infection and maintained at that concentration after infection. cell viability was detected with a CCK-8 assay after treatment with Tg, Tu, and 4-PBA. IRE1 knockdown decreased TGEV N protein and virus production. IRE1 knockdown decreased TGEV titers by up to 4-fold. IRE1 knockdown decreased TGEV titers by up to 4-fold. IRE1 and ATF6 pathways did not suppress TGEV infection. ST cells were transfected for 24 h with siRNA duplexes that target IRE1. at 24 hpi, Western blotting was performed to detect HA and TGEV N. PERK-eIF2 pathway inhibits TGEV replication. PERK inhibition was confirmed by Western blotting p-PERK and p-eIF2. the most significant upregulation of the TGEV N protein was observed at 1 M PERKi compared to 0.5 M and 10 M. transfection of shPERK significantly reduced the expression of PERK. p-eIF2 is primarily mediated through activation of PERK instead of other eIF2 kinases in TGEV infection. ST cells were transfected with eIF2 or control shRNA for 24 h. then challenged with TGEV for 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Viral titers were calculated at different time points. salubrinal treatment significantly increased the phosphorylated eIF2 in TGEV-infected cells compared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control cells. increased phosphorylated eIF2 by salubrinal treatment caused a decrease in TGEV replication ranging from 30- to 551-fold for TGEV in ST cells. eIF2 knockdown significantly suppresses TGEV replication. the PERK-eIF2 pathway attenuates global protein synthesis. a previous study showed that autophagy negatively regulates TGEV infection. ST cells were pretreated with Tg (1 M) or a combination with 3MA (5 mM) 2 h before infection. titers were calculated (A), and Western blotting was performed. TGEV infection decreased global protein synthesis. ST cells were transfected with eIF2 siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h. at 24 hpi, global protein synthesis was measured by OPP labeling. PERK phosphorylation of eIF2 suppresses TGEV replication due to NF-B activation. previous studies showed that eIF2 activation in response to TGEV is linked to induction of IFN-I production and suppression of viral replication via NF-B activation. ST cells were transfected with different concentrations of HA-eIF2wt for 24 h. then infected with TGEV H87 (MOI = 1). cell lysates of ST cells were analyzed by Western blotting. previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection potently induces IFN- (25\u201327), as well as IFN-, in IPEC-J2, ST, and PK-15 cells (28, 53\u201355) the NF-B signaling pathway has a fundamental role in TGEV-induced IFN-I production in PK-15 cells. PERK-eIF2 axis has a vital role in IFN-I induction in response to TGEV infection. we measured viral titers after treatment with porcine IFN-. we found that IFN suppressed TGEV replication in a dose-dependent manner. eIF2wt-transfected ST cells were analyzed by ELISA after TGEV infection. expression levels of supernatant IFN-/ in salubrinal-treated ST cells were analyzed. TGEV infection induces ER stress in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells. samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi. a time-dependent increase of GRP78 expression was revealed. TGEV infection triggers ER stress in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells. ER stress potentially triggers the three UPR signaling pathways. ire1 activation promotes endoribonuclease activity of IRE1. tI has a recognition site located within the 26-nt region of XBP1 cDNA that is removed by IRE1-mediated splicing. the spliced XBP1s form increased after TGEV infection, consistent with a decrease in the unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u), indicating that IRE1 was activated in the later phase of infection. ST cells were treated with Tu (2 g/ml) and mock infected with TGEV. the PCR product of XBP1 was further digested with PstI. the digested PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. phosphorylation indicated below the blots, with the phosphorylation at 0 hpi given a value of 1. (E) PERK pathway downstream ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34 gene expression. cells were lysed to extract total RNA, which was used to determine the expression of ATF4, CHOP, and GAPDH genes by qPCR. TGEV infection activates all three UPR pathways in vivo. ileum tissues from TGEV-infected piglets were inoculated with TGEV strain H87. piglets were euthanized by the end of the study, which was terminated at 48 hpi. XBP1s/XBP1t (XBP1-spliced/XBP1-total) ratio and mRNA expression of ERdj4 gene in ileum samples from TGEV-infected and -infected piglets. phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2 and of cleaved ATF6 increased in TGEV-infected ileum tissues compared with control samples. ER stress inducer Tg (1 M) or Tu (2 g/ml) substantially inhibited TGEV infection in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV suppression by Tg or Tu was confirmed by monitoring TGEV N protein expression. 4-PBA pretreated ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) the 4-PBA treatment decreased eIF2 phosphorylation (64% decrease) in TGEV-infected cells. the 4-PBA treatment potently enhanced TGEV replication in both cell lines. IRE1 knockdown decreased TGEV N protein and virus production. inhibition of IRE1 activity by 48C decreased TGEV titers by up to 4-fold. IRE1 pathway promotes TGEV infection instead of suppressing TGEV replication. XBP1 mRNA splicing and mRNA expression of the ERdj4 gene in IRE1 knockdown cells were determined. cells were harvested at 24 hpi and subjected to XBP1 splicing assay and Western blotting using antibodies against TGEV N protein. suppressing eIF2 phosphorylation by 4-PBA treatment enhanced TGEV replication. we hypothesized that the PERK-eIF2 pathway of the UPR primarily accounts for the viral inhibition of the TGEV-induced UPR. PERK knockdown and PERKi implied that p-eIF2 is primarily mediated by activation of PERK instead of other eIF2 kinases in TGEV infection. PERK knockdown showed significantly increased titers in PERK knockdown cells at 12, 24, and 36 hpi. the TGEV TCID50 in the supernatants was titrated on ST cells. at 24 hpi, Western blot analysis was performed to detect p-eIF2, TGEV N, or -actin, and the viral titers were calculated. replication ranging from 30- to 551-fold for TGEV in ST cells. decreased replication of TGEV by salubrinal treatment was not due to cellular cytotoxicity. eIF2 phosphorylation negatively regulates TGEV replication. a previous study showed that autophagy negatively regulates TGEV infection. however, we did not observe rescue of Tg-mediated reduction of TGEV replication after combining the Tg treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA). ST cells were infected with TGEV H87 (MOI = 1) or mock infected for 6, 12, 24, 36, or 48 h before OPP labeling. values for mock-infected cells set to 1.0. ISRIB was used at 200 nM based on previous publications (52) and our own pilot studies. eIF2 phosphorylation suppresses TGEV replication due to IFN-I induction via NF-B activation. salubrinal enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation in TGEV-infected ST cells. phosphorylation of eIF2 by PERK contributes to the activation of NF-B in response to TGEV infection. phosphorylation of eIF2 by PERK contributes to the activation of NF-B. ST cells were transfected with eIF2 siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h prior to TGEV infection and harvested at 24 hpi for Western blot analyses with the indicated antibodies. the effect of TGEV-induced IFN-/ was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with the NF-B inhibitor CAPE. the production of TGEV-induced IFN-/ was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with CAPE. the expression levels of IFN-/ in eIF2 overexpression and knockdown cells were analyzed after TGEV infection. eIF2 phosphorylation significantly promoted IFN-/ expression. poly(IC) treatment directly inhibited TGEV infection. eIF2 silence undermined poly(IC)-mediated TGEV inhibition. this further shows that eIF2 pathway is involved in NF-B activation and IFN-I production. infection with the alphacoronavirus TGEV elicited ER stress in vitro and in vivo and that ER stress had a detrimental effect on TGEV replication. the suppression of TGEV replication by the UPR was largely mediated by activation of the PERK-eIF2 branch. the levels of cytoplasm IB and leads to reduced inhibition of IB on NF-B. the stalled translation and IFN-/ production negatively regulate TGEV replication. ER stress has been observed in cells infected by coronaviruses. the IRE1 pathway does not modulate TGEV replication, based on the results of siRNA knockdown. blockade of the IRE1 pathway decreased TGEV replication. overexpression of the spliced XBP1s, the major effector of the IRE1 signaling pathway, enhanced TGEV replication. phosphorylation of eIF2 reduces translation of most mRNAs by inhibiting delivery of the initiator Met-tRNAi to the initiation complex, allowing cells to conserve resources (9). TGEV infection triggered phosphorylation of eIF2 which led to a significant reduction in global protein synthesis. global inhibition of translation largely mediated by eIF2 phosphorylation represents a critical part of the cellular antiviral response that blocks viral protein synthesis. NF-B regulates the genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, stress remediation, and cell growth (29). previous studies have shown that PERK and eIF2 phosphorylation is required for NF-B in the response to diverse noninfectious stress conditions. PERK-eIF2 pathway activates IFN-I production independent of the NF-B-mediated pathway. TGEV infection induced ER stress and activated all three UPR pathways. PERK pathway negatively regulated TGEV replication by attenuating protein translation and promoting IFN-I production. line IPEC-J2 was grown in DMEM\u2013nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham) (1:1) (DMEM-F12) (Gibco), supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 g/ml insulin-transferring selenium supplements (Gibco), 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
