{"summary": "the use of nanoparticles in vaccinology is inspired by the fact that most pathogens have a dimension within the nano-size range. this leads to a potent immune response against the recombinant HA/H7N9 protein. we report a simple approach to increase antigen size to achieve fast but also effective responses against the recombinant HA/H7N9 protein. the physical mixture of trimeric H7 protein and nanodiamond (1:12, w/w) elicited statistically significant stronger H7-specific-IgG response. results indicated a potential effect inherent to nanodiamond towards modulating immune systems."}
