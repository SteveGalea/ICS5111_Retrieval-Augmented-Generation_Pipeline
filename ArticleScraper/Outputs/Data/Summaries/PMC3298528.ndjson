{"summary": "the association between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) status of a herd and respiratory disease (BRD) occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows. the association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. bovine respiratory disease refers to bacterial bronchopneumonia that may be complicated by previous, or concurrent, viral or mycoplasma infection. bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). acute BRD has been found to occur mainly during cold months. poor fertility is the leading cause of culling cows in Estonia. problems associated with reduced fertility in dairy cattle are related to diseases of the reproductive tract of the cow, bull fertility, breeding management, and the environment. the target population in our study was dairy cattle herds with more than 20 cows. herds were stratified according to number of cows into five classes. herds were included in the study depending on their BHV-1 antibody status. questions were asked relating to the history of the peak occurrence of respiratory disease, within the previous two years, of cows and pregnant heifers. the number of abortions, as well as the herd's average insemination index for cows and heifers was recorded if registered in farm. status was established by testing up to 20 (depending on herd size) randomly selected serum samples from heifers for BRSV antibodies to allow detection of at least a 15% prevalence of BRSV antibody carriers in each herd. Depending on herd size up to 25 heifers and 10 cows were tested for Mycoplasma bovis antibodies in each herd. this enabled to detect the prevalence of at least 15% among heifers and 27% among cows with 95% level of confidence variable Number of herds Model I Model II Nasal discharge (\"red nose\") in cows and/or pregnant heifers 0 - not present at all or was shown only as single cases at some point during the last two years 82 (NASCOW) 1 - present in more than just single cases at some point during the last two years 88 (LACCOW) 1 - present in more than just single cases at some point during the last two years 12 Respiratory disease occurrence in cows and/ d size 3 - 20-99 cows 40 25 (hsize) 4 - 100-199 cows 19 17 5 - 200-399 cows 23 21 6 - > 400 cows 18 14 Inseminator an employee of the farm 0 - no 28 (insoth) 1 - yes 23 Using bull to inseminate heifers 0 - no 61 (bullh) 1 - yes 44 Keeping youngstock together with cows 0 three variables (RESCOW, NASCOW and LACCOW) were used to create one summary variable. if at least two out of three variables had a value of one, the herd was considered to be in the category of \"high occurrence of BRD in cows and/or pregnant heifers\" the aim of the second model (Model II) was to detect the linkage between herd BHV-1 seroprevalence and poor reproductive performance in cows and heifers. 'grazing youngstock', 'grazing cows' and 'number of livestock units within the farm' were highly collinear and had the same explanation. two herds were excluded from the data analysis owing to missing values. logistic regression models were built to quantify estimates of relationships between outcome and predictor variables. all variables with p-value 0.2 selected in the univariable logistic regression analysis [21] were excluded with backward elimination procedure. a questionnaire that recorded herd-level data was completed for every herd. the information requested included: herd size, number of livestock units per farm, deployment of the veterinarian and inseminator. the number of abortions, as well as the average insemination index for cows and heifers for the previous year was recorded if registered in. sample analysis All serum samples were tested for BHV-1 antibodies using a commercial BHV-1 gB ELISA test kit, HerdChek* (IDEXX, Switzerland) with 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity. BVDV status was established by testing up to 10 serum samples from randomly selected animals, at ages from six months up to age at first calving. the first model was to clarify the association between herd BHV-1 seroprevalence and respiratory disease occurrence in adult dairy cattle. on each farm the veterinarian or farm manager was questioned about the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease, including nasal discharge (\"red nose\") and respiratory signs (cough, dyspnoea), and lacrimation. 20 Lacrimation in cows and/or pregnant heifers 0 - not present at all or was shown only as single cases at some point during the last two years 88 (LACCOW) 1 - present in more than just single cases at some point during the last two years 12 Respiratory disease occurrence in cows and/or pregnant heifers 0 - less than two respiratory disease symptoms were present in more than a single case at some time during the last two years 19 Incidence of some period of life tied, some period loose 47 Housing for cows 1 - tied 71 (keco) 2 - loose 29 Has the farm purchased new animals within the last three years (purc) 0 - no 1 - yes 47 53 BVDV present in the herd 0 - no 77 57 (BVD) 1 - yes (at least one animal tested positive) 23 20 RSV prevalence 0 - negative 46 34 (BRSV) 1 - 1 - 49% 40 herd size, herds with 20-49 and those with 50-99 cattle were merged into one smallest herd size category (20-99 cows) all the continuous independent variables were transformed into categorical variables to avoid violating the assumption of linearity in logistic regression analysis. logistic regression for binary variables (command mi impute) for each missing data point, five imputation values were generated. Imputed values were created for four herds for the variable \"BHV-1 prevalence in heifers\" (4%), for six herds for the variables \"BVDV prevalence\" and \"Mycoplasma bovis prevalence in heifers\" (8%), for eight herds for the variable \"BRSV prevalence in heifers\" (8%), and for one herd for \" the fit of the model was evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [21] there was no indication of lack of fit in the logistic regression models. 33% of the variables related to infections and 19% of those related to herd management were significantly associated with the outcome variables. a low to moderate prevalence of BRSV measured in youngstock (1-49%) was significantly related to a higher occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6.2, CI 1.6; 25.0, p = 0.010) among cows and pregnant heifers. herd size, as a confounding variable, was also controlled in the model. the three outcome variables NASCOW, RESCOW and LACCOW were significantly related to each other in the chi-square test. the total cumulative inertia for the first two axes in the MCA was 80.39% (75.01% and 5.38% for axes 1 and 2). the management-related variables linked to the first axis were the largest herd size category (test value 7.35), loose housing of cows (6.20), the veterinarian (6.61) and inseminator (6.60) being the employees of the farm. 9% 40 6.2 0.010 1.6;
