{"summary": "many genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and computational technologies are now developed that contribute to the knowledge on which proteins interact with each other. biophysical methods include proximity ligation assay (606), cross-linking (661), pulldown assay (667), coimmunoprecipitation (316), and tandem affinity purification (TAP) two-hybrid systems depend on the PPI-induced refolding of two protein fragments to reconstitute a functional reporter. two-hybrid systems do not depend on the PPI-induced refolding of protein fragments but rather on the colocalization of two protein domains. two-hybrid systems have reporter gene activation as an output. this is an important factor of signal amplification to increase the sensitivity of the method. but with the cost of lowered selectivity, the balance between sensitivity and selectivity is also seen in PCAs. two proteins of interest (X and Y) are fused to a fixed protein fragment. if there is no interaction between X and Y, the fragments remain unstructured. a minimal time frame of physical contact between the fragments is necessary to establish complete refolding. in vitro PCA applications are not mentioned, but there are public reports on the use of these techniques for discovery of PPI-inhibiting compounds (243). this review provides insights into two-hybrid systems and PCAs, highlighting their applications, advantages, and limitations. the first part describes the evolution of the original yeast two-hybrid system. alian two-hybrid system (mammalian cells) (535) Mammalian protein-protein

applications in library screening for PPIs limited to one or a few bait proteins in parallel. several methods showed promise in prototype experiments with controlled libraries. a strain that expresses the hybrid genes GAL4(1-147)-SNF1 and GAL4(768-881)-SNF4 is capable of inducing expression of an Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene controlled by the GAL1 promoter. one protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Gal4 (the bait) and the other protein is fused with the activation domain (AD) of Gal4 (the prey) two-hybrid strains contain multiple reporter genes, with a different promoter region for each reporter, to enable a wider spectrum of sensitivity and selectivity. a more recent selection approach takes advantage of the yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as a reporter to screen for interacting pairs by fluorescence-associated cell sorting. leucine biosynthesis (234) S. cerevisiae ADE2 Prototrophic reporter for lysine biosynthesis (374) Aequorea victoria GFPuv Fluorescent reporter (107) EGFP Fluorescent reporter (613) Yeast EGFP Fluorescent reporter (613) Yeast EGFP Fluorescent reporter for flow cytometry screens (88) CEN-based plasmids and truncated ADH1 promoters lower bait and prey expression levels for high selectivity. 2m-based vectors and GAL1 or full-length ADH1 promoters contribute to an increased sensitivity of the system. bait integration provides a very attractive alternative to the traditional episomal approach. binding domain, activation domain, and the reporter genes likely influence the number of positive (true and false) results. some activation domains are strong expression inducers, particularly VP16, while the B42 AD is known to be a weaker activator (62, 557). the screening step is performed by mating of both strains on medium selective for an interaction. prey plasmids can be pooled in a library or tested individually for one-to-one interactions. prey constructs that activate reporter genes independently from the nature of the bait are easily discarded. prey proteins, A to H (N = 3), we have 6 (2 3) unique pools (pool 1, A/B/C/D; pool 2, E/F/G/H; pool 3, A/B/E/F; pool 4, C/D/G/H; pool 5, A/C/E/G; and pool 6, B/D/F/H) each protein present 3 times. s normalized cDNA Normalizes the amount of cDNA fragments for each gene (683); +, exclusion of noncoding fragments and introns, correct orientation, better representation of each cDNA fragment. expensive, complete cDNA fragments reduce the positive outcome rate for specific types of interactions (e.g., with membrane proteins) protocols. the yeast two-hybrid system has established a prominent position in cell biological research and led to the discovery of thousands of PPIs. the method complements affinity purification, particularly tandem affinity purification, for the unbiased detection of new protein associations. it has played a crucial role as the starting point of very diverse studies. yeast two-hybrid system was applied for context-dependent PPI studies. interaction between two catalytic and two regulatory subunits of protein kinase A in S. cerevisiae is stimulated by the kelch repeat proteins Krh1 and Krh2. formation of the tetrameric protein kinase complex is partially inhibited, as shown by a yeast two-hybrid experiment (506) the two-hybrid system required specific modifications to generate accurate data. a temperature-sensitive cdc4-1 yeast two-hybrid strain was constructed to prove the interaction between Sic1 and catalytically inactive Cdc4. the first two-hybrid screening on a large scale was carried out by Fields, Rothberg, and colleagues in 2000 (650). 192 individual bait strains were mated each time with 1 of 6,000 ORF prey strains, identifying 281 protein associations. a second large-scale assay (294) was performed by making approximately 6,000 ORF bait and prey strains. total number of ORF pairs tested to the total possible number of ORF pairs of the organism under study. the assay sensitivity (the fraction of interactions that can possibly be identified by the assay), and the sampling sensitivity (the fraction of all identifiable interactions in a single trial of an assay) the yeast two-hybrid system has also been applied in large-scale research. many computational studies have evaluated the false-positive and false-negative rates of two-hybrid results by using random and positive reference sets. a positive reference set of binary interactions has been proposed to accurately validate high-throughput data. estimates go from 24% to 51% for the false discovery rate (119, 278) and from 45% to 96% for the false-negative rate (159). detection of PPIs is skewed toward highly abundant proteins due to the use of native promoters. high-throughput PPI data have assisted in the functional characterization of proteins (4, 23, 260, 333, 383, 540, 583), the analysis of interaction network topologies (8, 121, 185, 303, 399, 496, 527, 680, 685, 743. alternative two-hybrid technologies can play a central role in this data verification. a particular case of a false-positive result is autoactivation by the bait protein, i.e., the bait by itself can induce expression of the reporter genes independently of the prey. a number of interacting protein pairs are not able to induce reporter gene expression. extracellular proteins, membrane proteins, and generally all proteins with a strong localization signal will often not move to the nucleus. however, membrane proteins need the phospholipid bilayer to fold in the right conformation. s to the protein of interest could obstruct the interaction. however, the addition of flexible glycine linkers to stimulate independent folding of the different components of the fusion protein can also improve the outcome. a two-hybrid system has been shown to be highly versatile systems for research on dynamic PPIs. brid system provides a technique to investigate interactions in a eukaryotic cell. transient and weak associations can be detected due to signal amplification. lack of a cumbersome purification step also adds to the efficiency of the system. method allows the identification of new binding partners of a protein of interest. a strain that expresses the hybrid genes GAL4(1-147)-SNF1 and GAL4(768-881)-SNF4 is capable of inducing expression of an Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene controlled by the GAL1 promoter. the DNA-binding domain fusion was named the \u201cbait\u201d that is used to \u201ccapture\u201d the so-called \u201cprey\u201d activation domain fusion. two-hybrid strains contain multiple reporter genes, with a different promoter region for each reporter. a more recent selection approach takes advantage of the yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as a reporter to screen for interacting pairs by fluorescence-associated cell sorting (87\u201389) cerevisiae LEU2* Prototrophic reporter for leucine biosynthesis (234) S. cerevisiae ADE2* Prototrophic reporter for lysine biosynthesis (374) Aequorea victoria GFPuv Fluorescent reporter (107) EGFP Fluorescent reporter (613) Yeast EGFP Fluorescent reporter (167) Prey activation domains S. cerevisiae Gal4 AD Gal4 activating region II (a truncated plasmids and truncated ADH1 promoters lower bait and prey expression levels for high selectivity. 2m-based vectors and GAL1 or full-length ADH1 promoters contribute to an increased sensitivity. the identities of the DNA-binding domain, the activation domain, and the reporter genes likely further influence the number of positive (true and false) results. some activation domains are strong expression inducers, particularly VP16, while the B42 AD is known to be a weaker activator (62, 557). the screening step is performed by mating of both strains on medium selective for an interaction. prey plasmids can be pooled in a library or tested individually for one-to-one interactions. prey plasmids can be pooled in a library or tested individually for one-to-one interactions. each prey protein represented N times with each protein present 3 times. if pools 1, 3, and 5 lead to growth on selective medium, the distinctive conclusion is that prey A interacts with the bait. this strategy relies on the small number of positive clones to be expected. coding fragments, strong difference in abundance between different cDNA fragments Normalized cDNA Normalizes the amount of cDNA fragments for each gene (683); +, exclusion of noncoding fragments and introns, correct orientation, better representation of each cDNA fragment. expensive, complete cDNA fragments reduce the positive outcome rate for specific types of interactions (e.g., with membrane proteins) proposed for the identification of bait-prey pairs by en masse sequencing after fusing the associated bait and prey genes. proposed for significant cost reduction of the analysis step (723) the two-hybrid system has been the subject of many improvements of its fundamental components, e.g., the reporter genes, the AD, and the DBD. the two-hybrid system has been the subject of many improvements. reporter gene lacZ can be applied for confirmation of interaction in a semiquantitative (169) galactosidase assay. reporter genes, activation domains, and DNA-binding domains used in yeast two-hybrid experiments. AUR1-C Aureobasidin A resistance reporter (167) Prey activation domains S. cerevisiae Gal4 AD Gal4 activating region II (aa 768 to 881), moderate strength (178) Herpes simplex virus VP16 AD VP16 activating region (aa 413 to 490), high strength (673) E. coli B42 AD Bacterial polypeptide, weak strength (234) Bait DNA-binding domains S. cerevis the impact of bait and prey vector identity on the positive output of interaction assays was studied with Treponema pallidum and Escherichia coli motility-related proteins (531). different combinations of bait and prey vectors led to differences in the number of positive results, the subset of detected PPIs, and the reliability of the outcome. all 70 proteins of this virus were cloned as both N- and C-terminal fusions with the DBD and AD. this result shows the intrinsic capacity of the system to find a substantially larger number of PPIs by partially overcoming the steric hindrance problem. characterization of PPIs in genome-scale two-hybrid screenings is cumbersome. one-to-one characterization of PPIs in genome-scale two-hybrid screenings is. cumbersome, and therefore small prey pool strategies are still the common way to screen. the relative number of pools to be screened decreases exponentially with the number of prey proteins, from 4 pools for 4 proteins to 10 pools for 32 proteins and 14 pools for 128 proteins. smart-pool arrays offer an elegant method to screen for PPIs in the yeast two-hybrid system. open reading frame DNA Each open reading frame is individually cloned into the prey library by in vivo (gap repair) or in vitro (Gateway from Invitrogen) recombinational cloning (294, 650); +, exclusion of noncoding fragments and introns. expensive, introns are present, complete ORF fragments reduce the positive outcome rate for specific types of interactions (e.g., with membrane proteins) Protocols. a yeast two-hybrid experiment brings the proteins of interest into a rather unnatural situation because they are directed to the nucleus (forced colocalization), their corresponding genes are not expressed under the control of their own promoters (forced coexpression) a yeast two-hybrid experiment brings the proteins of interest into a rather unnatural situation because they are directed to the nucleus (forced colocalization), their corresponding genes are not expressed under the control of their own promoter alternative genetic PPI methods are available for nonyeast proteins. interaction between two catalytic and two regulatory subunits of protein kinase A in S. cerevisiae is stimulated by the kelch repeat proteins Krh1 and Krh2. formation of the tetrameric protein kinase complex is partially inhibited. a yeast two-hybrid strain was constructed to prove the interaction between Sic1 and catalytically inactive Cdc4. the two-hybrid system is generally considered to detect binary and direct interactions. however, the two-hybrid system is generally considered to detect binary and direct interactions. yeast two-hybrid system was applied for context-dependent PPI studies. interaction between two catalytic and two regulatory subunits of protein kinase A in S. cerevisiae is stimulated by the kelch repeat proteins Krh1 and Krh2. formation of the tetrameric protein kinase complex is partially inhibited. a temperature-sensitive cdc4-1 yeast two-hybrid strain was constructed to prove the interaction between Sic1 and catalytically inactive Cdc4. the two-hybrid system is generally considered to detect binary and direct interactions, a notion which may be true for many nonnuclear and nonyeast PPIs. the first two-hybrid screening on a large scale was carried out by Fields, Rothberg, and colleagues in 2000. 192 individual bait strains were mated each time with 1 of 6,000 ORF prey strains. a second large-scale assay (294) was performed by making approximately 6,000 ORF bait strains. the yeast two-hybrid system has also been applied in large-scale research to investigate intraviral interactions. it has also been employed for interactome mapping of Campylobacter jejuni (494), Helicobacter pylori (529), Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (562), Bacillus subtilis (431, 472), Plasmodium falciparum (369), Arabidopsis thaliana (59,235), Dros a positive reference set of binary interactions has been proposed to accurately validate high-throughput data. estimates go from 24% to 51% for the false discovery rate (119, 278) and from 45% to 96% for the false-negative rate (159). in general, two proteins are more likely to be true interactors if they tend to share common features. 192 individual bait strains were mated each time with 1 of 6,000 ORF prey strains. a second large-scale assay (294) was performed by making approximately 6,000 ORF bait and prey strains. four hundred mating reactions were carried out, each time with 96 bait strains against 96 prey strains. 3,917 nonautoactivating bait strains were individually mated with 5,246 prey strains (merged in 94 pools), uncovering 1,809 PPIs, of which 274 interactions were found in the two previous high-throughput experiments. the low level of overlap between the three data sets can be explained by false-positive records and false-negative results. cost reduction and technological improvements allowed for high-throughput two-hybrid screenings but shifted the limiting step toward the confirmation and validation of interaction data. small-scale two-hybrid results can be verified by alternative interaction techniques, such as a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay or coimmunoprecipitation. nucleus, conserved, essential, weakly autoactivating, and structurally disordered proteins are overrepresented in two-hybrid data. but no biases toward protein function were found. for high-throughput affinity purification assays, detection of PPIs is skewed toward highly abundant proteins. a subset of the complete interactome can provide only very limited information on the kinetics or dynamics of a PPI. interacting proteins are detected that are not present in the same subcellular location or time under natural conditions. these proteins might indeed be able to interact, but the interactions have no biological relevance (biological artifacts) the bait protein, i.e., can induce expression of reporter genes independently of the prey. a number of interacting protein pairs are not able to induce reporter gene expression. alternative two-hybrid technologies can be used to address this problem. the use of chimeras has also been criticized because the addition of fusion constructs to the protein of interest could obstruct the interaction. the use of chimeras has also been criticized because the addition of fusion constructs to the protein of interest could obstruct the interaction. the yeast two-hybrid system provides a technique to investigate interactions in the environment of a eukaryotic cell and with the easy handling characteristics of S. cerevisiae. the method allows the identification of new binding partners of a protein of interest, which plays an important role in the functional analysis of uncharacterized proteins. alternative two-hybrid and PCA technologies can play a central role in this data verification. spurious results remain a considerable drawback, and only more experimental in-depth analysis can provide conclusive confirmation of a biologically relevant interaction. extracellular proteins, membrane proteins, and generally all proteins with a strong localization signal will often not move to the nucleus. in most cases, membrane proteins need the phospholipid bilayer to fold in the right conformation. a truncated version of the protein can be used to detect membrane PPIs. the yeast two-hybrid system provides a technique to investigate interactions in the environment of a eukaryotic cell and with the easy handling characteristics of S. cerevisiae. coexpression of the modifying enzyme in the heterologous host system can solve this issue, or the interaction analysis can be performed in vivo in other organisms. RNA Pol III transcribes genes that encode untranslated RNA molecules such as rRNA, tRNA, and other small RNAs. most of the genes controlled by RNA Pol III do not contain upstream activating sequences or a TATA box but rather have an intragenic regulation. the essential gene SNR6 encodes U6 snRNA. nuclear two-hybrid systems for autoactivating bait proteins. a temperature-sensitive mutant of SNR6 is tethered to the 138 subunit. a wild-type version as a reporter gene (511). ating bait proteins is the repressed transactivator (RTA) system (259) the transcriptional repressor domain of Tup1 replaces the AD in the prey. the reporter genes URA3 and HIS3 are repressed, leading to survival on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which is toxic in the presence of Ura3-mediated uracil synthesis. hSos is fused with the bait protein of interest and the prey protein is fused with a membrane localization signal. the method was further improved by introduction of a mammalian GTPase activating protein to lower the background activity of false-positive Ras prey proteins. the method has been applied for the discovery of inhibitors of HIV-1 Gag dimerization (652), the analysis of protein membrane localization, and the determination of numbers of transmembrane domains. an improved version was created by using mammalian activated Ras (mRas) instead of Sos in the cdc25-2 strain (64) the Ras recruitment system was further developed for use in mammalian cells. chimeric protein of bait X with hSos is recruited to the plasma membrane upon interaction of X with a membrane protein (Y) a membrane-bound prey protein Y that interacts with bait X, fused to mammalian Ras (mRas), will bring mRas to the membrane. interaction between a membrane-bound prey protein (Y) and a bait protein (X) unites the G protein and subunits to induce the pheromone pathway after addition of pheromone. the prey protein is attached to the membrane, intrinsically or artificially. interaction of bait with prey leads to membrane localization of Ste18cyto and subsequent activation of the pheromone pathway. increased selectivity of the system is provided by the introduction of an interaction competitor protein (191) and increased sensitivity is given by the integration of STE18 under the control of the pheromone response. the bait protein X is fused to an Ire1 variant (Ire1 K702R) that can splice Hac1 mRNA only while the prey protein Y is attached to an Ire1 variant (Ire1 tail) that can phosphorylate only its associated Ire1 partner. Upon an X-Y interaction within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, Ire1 tail phosphorylates Ire1 K702R, which in the membrane-bound receptor Ire1 senses stress caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of Ire1 is followed by homodimerization, trans-phosphorylation, and correct splicing of Hac1 mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the unfolded protein stress response. the system was applied to confirm interactions between Gcn4 and anti-Gcn4 antibodies and between the leucine zipper domains of c-Jun and c-Fos. the recently developed Golgi complex two-hybrid system is based on the complementation of the Golgi complex-resident mannosyltransferase Och1 (146) fibronectin (FNfn10) was shown by first fusing the N-terminal part of FNfn10 with the cell wall agglutinin protein Aga2. the C-terminal part of FNfn10, with a V5 epitope tag, was shown to be attached to the surface by immunofluorescence detection through its interaction with the N-terminal fragment of FNfn10. tyrosine phosphorylation, are absent in yeast. many of these interactions involved SH2 domains. tethered catalysis two-hybrid system deals with this problem. three tandem repeats of the CTD peptide of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit were fused to the Gal4 DBD and the serine/threonine kinase Kin28, which phosphorylates CTD. a ternary chimera of gal4 DBD, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and the related protein BARD1 was created. interaction of pVHL with cullin family member CUL-2 depends on pVHL-stabilizing effect of elongins B and C (503) analysis of the interacting domains by a four-hybrid analysis revealed a structural resemblance of this complex (CBCVHL) with the E3-like ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1/Cullin/F-box protein. the human prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 delivers the hydroxyl group to interacting prey proteins, which is essential for recognition by pVHL. a library of BG small-molecule heterodimers can be screened for interactions with a prey protein Y attached to the Gal4 AD. a yeast three-hybrid experiment was performed in a heterologous organism. the blue-light receptor CRY1 competitively interfered with the association of the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 with the phytochrome A suppressor SPA1. alternative approaches were developed with substitute small-molecule heterodimers, small-molecule-binding proteins, reporter genes, and DNA-binding and activation domains. sensitivity and stringency of these three-hybrid approaches were shown by recovering known small-molecule-binding proteins from a prey cDNA library. however, the full ability of the method was illustrated by the identification of novel targets of small-molecule kinase inhibitors (35) a three-hybrid strain was created by fusion of BG with a set of drug compounds. three genes (PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1) encoding broad-spectrum drug transporters were deleted to prevent efflux of the BG derivative. cells were grown in the absence of the BG derivative on medium with 5-FOA. the antibiotic cephalosporin, bordered by Mtx and Dex, was hydrolyzed by the -lactamase cephalosporinase, which resulted in a loss of lacZ reporter expression. improvements of the original approach included an increase of cell permeability (77), fine-tuning of hook and prey expression (22, 77), and introduction of a sensitive counterselection reporter for detection of bond-forming enzymes. BD and a fixed RNA-binding protein tested for interaction with a protein of interest fused to an AD (526, 575) interaction between the RNA and protein of interest induces expression of the reporter genes HIS3 and lacZ. the other RNA sequence is tested for interaction with a protein of interest fused to an AD (526, 575) the method enables screening of RNA molecules that bind an RNA-binding protein of interest (574, 712) or the discovery of RNA-binding proteins that interact with a specific artificial (359) or native (583) RNA stretch. RNA binding affinities can be measured based upon three-hybrid experiments (713) when specific considerations are taken into account. three commonly used reporters are URA3 (667), CYH2 (373), and GAL1 (228) which render the cells sensitive to 5-FOA, cycloheximide, and galactose in a gal7 background. a positive selection marker can also be used to investigate dissociation of a PPI. the original URA3 method provides a second selection step to discover mutations that do not completely block the interaction. nonsense mutations can be selected by the dissociation of the PPI together with the expression of the C-terminally linked reporter gene. mutants of human HIV-1 integrase INI1 (114) were cloned to a kanamycin resistance marker. recombinational cloning with the Gateway technique. identification of residues that moderate an interaction. ligand-induced two-hybrid interaction was taken as readout (96, 292) the forward two-hybrid system has been applied successfully in more studies related to mutagenesis. the forward system has been applied successfully in more studies related to mutagenesis, for the selection of mutants that either increase (43) or decrease (282) interaction strength. two-bait hybrid systems provide an interesting platform for discovering crucial amino acid residues that specifically reduce the affinity of a protein with one binding partner but not with another. two-bait hybrid systems provide an interesting platform for discovering crucial amino acid residues that specifically reduce the affinity of a protein with one binding partner. Mutated Snf1 fused to an activation domain was coexpressed with Gal4DBD-Snf4 and LexA-Snf1 kinase domain, binding to the lexA operator (lexA Op)-lacZ. selection by both a chromogenic (lacZ) and a growth-selective (HIS3) assay resolved all possible influences of mutations in a single screen. s and sensitivities of the reporters, enrichment for polylinkers for easier cloning, and increased diversity of the selective markers. two-bait systems also have an application in the exclusion of false-positive results. protein Y interacts with two proteins, X1 and X2 (as shown in the box) the bait DNA is inserted in front of a reporter gene and the prey protein consists of the prey protein of interest in fusion with an activation domain. the association of the bait DNA with the prey protein results in activation of the reporter gene. new developments in the two-hybrid field have been introduced in one-hybrid studies. chimeric protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activator stimulate expression of a reporter gene under the control of Gal upstream activating sequences. one-hybrid studies can be applied if the native target promoters of a putative transcription factor are not identified. the technique has also seen applications in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. RNA Pol III transcribes genes that encode untranslated RNA molecules such as rRNA, tRNA, and other small RNAs. most of the genes controlled by RNA Pol III do not contain upstream activating sequences or a TATA box but rather have an intragenic regulation. auX bait with prey protein (Y) fused to 138 subunit of transcription factor III C (TFIIIC) brings RNA polymerase III holoenzyme to SNR6. association of an autoactivating AuX bait with prey protein Y, attached to the repressor Tup1, inhibits transcription of the reporter gene URA3. this results in survival of the cell on 5-FOA, a substrate for the production of the toxic compound 5-fluorouracil by specific and nonspecific PPI inhibitors of four well-established protein pairs were identified by screening a compound library. this screening experiment required fine-tuning of the procedure with 3-AT and introduction of Leu3 binding sites for moderate basal expression of HIS3. an autoactivating bait protein can also be attached to the AD instead of the DBD, followed by screening with a library in fusion with the DBD (145). RNA Pol III transcribes genes that encode untranslated RNA molecules. most of the genes controlled by RNA Pol III do not contain upstream activating sequences or a TATA box but rather have an intragenic regulation. the essential gene SNR6, which encodes U6 snRNA, is an exception to the rule. association of an autoactivating AuX bait with the prey protein Y inhibits transcription of the reporter gene URA3. this results in survival of the cell on 5-FOA, a substrate for the production of the toxic compound 5-fluorouracil by the gene product of URA3. reliance of the DBD fusion protein (prey) on presence of the bait for reporter activation is examined by using the counterselectable marker CYH2 on the bait plasmid (152). the most prevalent strategy remains the removal of the region within the bait protein that initiates transcription in order to use the classic two-hybrid method. a strain was constructed with a temperature-sensitive mutant of cdc25, cdc25-2 (16) in the Sos recruitment system, the human Cdc25 homologue Sos (hSos) is fused with the bait protein of interest and the prey protein is fused with a membrane localization signal. the method was further improved by introduction of a mammalian activating protein to lower the background activity of false-positive Ras prey proteins. reverse Ras recruitment system was introduced to enable the use of membrane proteins as bait. mRas is fused to the prey rather than the bait (283) a membrane-bound prey protein Y that interacts with mRas will bring mRas to the membrane, where it can activate. adenylate cyclase is required to establish cell growth at a restrictive temperature (36\u00b0C) in a cdc25-2 background strain. association of the (Ste4) and (Ste18) subunits is required for signal transduction. dependent growth inhibition assay (halo assay) retain growth in the presence of pheromone and display reduced expression of a pheromone-controlled lacZ gene. a recent improved interaction tool combines the advantages of the G protein fusion system with the benefits of the Sos recruitment system (higher sensitivity) secretory pathway two-hybrid systems are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum. each compartment hosts one of the available two-hybrid systems. interaction of the bait with the prey within the Golgi lumen prevents loss (by secretion) of the Och1 catalytic domain. the membrane protein Aga1 keeps the Aga2-bait X fusion at the cellular membrane in the extracellular fluid. the bait and prey proteins of interest are N-terminally fused to Ire1K702R and Ire1tail respectively (653) interaction between the bait and prey proteins leads to dimerization of both mutants of Ire1, correct translation of Hac1 and expression of the reporter genes lacZ and HIS3, both under the control of a Hac1-regulated promoter. fusion of the two modular fragments of Och1 to the human transcription factor MyoD and the inhibitor of differentiation protein 2 (Id2) reverses all of the och1 phenotypes through the reassembly of Och1 upon myoD-Id2 interaction. an interaction between the transcriptional activator Gal4 and five binding partners was confirmed with the Golgi complex two-hybrid system. the yeast surface two-hybrid system detects interactions that two-hybrid system based on same principle to study peptide recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins (308). deletion of Cdc25, the GTP-GDP exchange factor and activator of the small membrane-bound GTPases Ras2 and Ras1 makes the cells inviable (65) mRas protein is tethered to the membrane to activate adenylate cyclase. the small size of mRas reduces the steric hindrance problem observed with the large hSos protein. the reverse Ras recruitment system was introduced to enable the use of membrane proteins as bait. membrane protein (Y) enables cell growth by virtue of Ras activity in a temperature-sensitive cdc25-2 background strain. a membrane-bound prey protein Y that interacts with bait X, fused to mammalian Ras, will bring mRas to the membrane, where it can activate its downstream target adenylate cyclase to establish cell growth at a restrictive temperature (36\u00b0C) in the G protein fusion system, the bait is a membrane protein and the prey is fused to Ste18 (162) when the prey strongly associates with the bait, Ste18 loses its interaction with Ste4. in case of an interaction, cells retain growth in the presence of pheromone and display reduced expression of a pheromone-controlled lacZ gene. several two-hybrid systems were developed in different subcompartments of the secretory pathway. proteins for secretion are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum, transported in vesicles to the golgi apparatus. each compartment hosts one of the available two-hybrid systems. the membrane protein Aga1 keeps the Aga2-bait X fusion at the cellular membrane in the extracellular fluid. both bait and prey proteins are linked with fragments of EGFP. Ire1 senses stress caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. re1, Ire1K702R and Ire1tail lack the kinase and Hac1-activating regions of the wild-type protein respectively. Upon dimerization of Ire1K702R with Ire1tail, Ire1tail can activate Ire1K702R, which in turn initiates Hac1 mRNA splicing for correct Hac1 translation. OC domain for membrane attachment and the C-terminal CAT domain perform the mannose transfer reaction within the Golgi complex lumen. deletion of OCH1 results in increased cell binding of chitin-binding reagents, such as wheat germ agglutinin, and in strongly reduced growth at a nonpermissive temperature (37\u00b0C) oiled-coil interactions and antigen-antibody recognition are suitable for quantitative interpretation (274) the appearance of fluorescence upon interaction-induced protein complementation was used to examine protein-protein binding. both types of readout are suitable for quantitative interpretation. adaptor protein CED-2, and the Schistosoma mansoni Tyr kinase TK4 (36, 70, 329, 362, 481, 482) were applied to detect human proteins that interact with the phosphorylated transcription factor c-Jun. the artificial character of a two-hybrid experiment may prevent posttranslational modifications, for example if the modifier is not colocalized with its target protein in the nucleus. autoubiquitination of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex enabled the identification of prey proteins that bind polyubiquitin. three-hybrid systems are further used to examine the reliance of a PPI on a third protein as a bridging molecule. ligase CBCVHL complex and its target proteins have been hampered in mammalian cells due to the fast ubiquitination-induced degradation of the targets. the problem was overcome by application of the yeast three-hybrid system, which involves the introduction of pVHL as a bait protein together with elongins B and C to stabilize the native conformation of pVHL. a chimeric protein of LexA and DHFR binds the promoter region of the reporter gene lacZ. it interacts with a tripartite small molecule through association of DHFR with Mtx. the whole complex stimulates expression of lacZ. the three-hybrid system has been adapted to investigate associations that go beyond PPIs. the bridging molecule is not necessarily a protein. alternative approaches were developed with substitute small-molecule heterodimers, small-molecule-binding proteins, reporter genes, and DNA-binding and activation domains. kinase inhibitors were found to bind both known and new CDK and CDK-like proteins in a screening assay that used HIS3 as a selective reporter gene and methotrexate (Mtx), which binds very tightly to a DNA-bound LexA-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion protein (2, 35), as a fixed small molecule in the heterodimer. the covalent linkage between LexA- the BG derivative induce reporter genes without the BG derivative. cells were grown on medium without histidine and in the presence of the BG derivative. new interactions partners were found for purvalanol B, erlotinib, atorvastatin, and sulfasalazine (94) mRNA-protein interactions play an essential role in many fundamental cellular processes. interactions between RNA and proteins play an essential role in many fundamental cellular processes. RNA three-hybrid system is susceptible to revealing a large number of false-positive results due mainly to direct binding of nonspecific prey proteins to the hook fusion. other approaches to exclude RNA-independent false-positive results depend on the auxotrophic marker on the RNA plasmid (40, 492) or on an inducible promoter for RNA hybrid gene expression (20). independent groups discovered the Pumilio and FBF homology (PUF) protein repeats that recognize cytosine in RNA, based upon three-hybrid experiments. artificial PUF proteins can be created to bind specific mRNA sequences for translation control. alternative RNA three-hybrid setups have enabled the identification of trimeric protein-RNA complexes and RNA-RNA interactions (515) acetylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation occur commonly in S. cerevisiae. the artificial character of a two-hybrid experiment may prevent posttranslational modifications, for example, if the modifier is not colocalized with its target protein in the nucleus. three-hybrid systems are used to examine the reliance of a PPI on a third protein as a bridging molecule. interaction between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as bait and the Sos protein as prey was illustrated to depend on the presence of a third adaptor protein, Grb2 (727). the third gene can be put under the control of an inducible promoter, for example, the MET25 promoter, repressed by methionine all components are present to identify prey proteins as targets of pVHL. absence of CUL-2 prevents unwanted induction of target protein degradation. a human cDNA library in fusion with the Gal4 AD is screened for interactions. a small-molecule trimer consists of a bait linker X and dexamethasone (Dex) the whole complex stimulates expression of lacZ. an enzyme Y that targets and cleaves linker X can be identified by disruption of the transcription activating complex. the three-hybrid system has been adapted to investigate associations that go beyond PPIs. a fusion of the LexA DNA-binding protein with the rat glucocorticoid receptor (LexA-RGR; the \u201chook\u201d) associates with a covalently linked heterodimer of two small molecules (Dex-FK506; the \u201cbait\u201d) by binding of protein RGR with the steroid hormone agonist dexamethasone ( a screening assay used HIS3 as a selective reporter gene and methotrexate (Mtx) which binds very tightly to a DNA-bound LexA-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion protein (2, 35), as a fixed small molecule in the heterodimer. the covalent linkage between LexA-AGT and BG significantly increases the sensitivity of the assay. the drug compounds were performed with GST pulldown assays using GST-coupled AGT-BG constructs. new interactions partners were found for the drugs purvalanol B, erlotinib, atorvastatin, and sulfasalazine (94). the experimental approach sets a standard for future protein\u2013small-molecule assays. RNA-protein interactions play an essential role in many fundamental cellular processes. interactions between mRNA and proteins play an essential role in many fundamental cellular processes. the RNA three-hybrid system is susceptible to revealing a large number of false-positive results. mainly due to direct binding of nonspecific prey proteins to the hook fusion. other approaches to exclude RNA-independent false-positive results depend on the auxotrophic marker on the RNA plasmid. alternative RNA three-hybrid setups have enabled the identification of trimeric protein-RNA complexes (54, 411) and RNA-RNA interactions (515) and the design of transcription-activating RNA stretches (687) an ingenious bacterial one-hybrid method is available for detection of heterologous RNA-protein interactions. mutations in the bait or prey protein of interest that block an interaction lead to an easily detectable resistance of the cells to 5-FOA. interaction between bait X and prey Y stimulates transcription of URA3, which results in cell toxicity in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. nonsense mutations can be excluded prior to two-hybrid screening. nonsense mutations can also be excluded prior to the two-hybrid screening. nonsense mutations can also be excluded prior to the two-hybrid screening. ubiquitin-like domain proteins in S. cerevisiae (214) and between two nonstructural proteins, nsp10 and nsp16, from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (414) analysis of allosteric inhibition of an interaction has also been described. mutations in A. thaliana PYR1 that inhibit its pyrabactin-induced association with HAB1 were identified by the reverse two-hybrid system the reverse two-hybrid system has applications in the discovery of peptides or small molecules that disrupt a PPI. the method shows clear advantages, as cytotoxicity testing is included in the assay, high-throughput screening is possible (279) the use of the reverse two-hybrid system for drug discovery in yeast has been limited (e.g., see reference 710) three commonly used reporters are URA3 (667), CYH2 (373), and GAL1 (228) which render the cells sensitive to 5-FOA, cycloheximide, and galactose in a gal7 background. a positive selection marker can also be used to investigate dissociation of a PPI. the original URA3 method provides a second selection step to discover mutations that do not completely block the interaction. nonsense mutations can be selected by the dissociation of the PPI together with the expression of the C-terminally linked reporter gene. d screening by cloning the mutated genes N-terminally to a kanamycin resistance marker and preselecting for the right reading frame in E. coli (217). the strength of this strategy lies in the removal of the kanamycin marker by subcloning the library into a new vector by recombinational cloning with the Gateway technique. examples of the use of the reverse two-hybrid system include the isolation of multimerization-defective mutant a ligand-induced two-hybrid interaction was taken as readout (96, 292) the forward two-hybrid system has been applied successfully in more studies related to mutagenesis. the forward system has been applied successfully in more studies related to mutagenesis, for the selection of mutants that either increase (43) or decrease (282) interaction strength. escence anisotropy (525), surface plasmon resonance (315, 570), and virtual screening (726) have more impact on this field, at least in publically available reports. however, other two-hybrid methodologies have also been used for the discovery of PPI inhibitors. Mutated Snf1 fused to an activation domain was coexpressed with Gal4DBD-Snf4, binding to the GAL1-HIS3 reporter, and LexA-Snf1 kinase domain, binding to the lexA operator (lexA Op)-lacZ. a similar method was applied for identification of missense mutations in the yeast scaffold protein Ste5 that specifically disrupt an interaction with either Ste11 or Ste7. two-bait systems also have an application in the exclusion of false-positive results. proteins interacting with the bait protein of interest but not with a control bait can easily be discarded, thereby reducing technical false-positive results. bait DNA is inserted in front of a reporter gene and prey protein consists of the prey protein of interest in fusion with an activation domain. new developments in the two-hybrid field, such as the application of several reporters, have been introduced in one-hybrid studies. assay can single out proteins that bind a fixed promoter of interest. a chimeric protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activator stimulate expression of a reporter gene under the control of Gal upstream activating sequences. the one-hybrid system is unique in the sense that it can screen for both proteins that bind a specific DNA sequence (686) and prey proteins recognized by a specific protein (706) new developments in the two-hybrid field, such as the application of several reporters, have been introduced in one-hybrid studies. a putative DNA-binding protein Y is in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain. interaction of protein Y with a promoter X stimulates reporter gene expression. an application of such a system is the identification of ligands that trigger NR nuclear import and activity. the one-hybrid system has been specifically suitable for the discovery of ligands and cofactors of higher eukaryote nuclear receptors. the technique has also seen applications in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans (554) and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (441). the development of a PCA requires knowledge of the structure of the candidate reporter to identify possible sites at which to split the protein. potential PCA reporters have gone through many optimizations, by site-directed (312, 633) and random (156) mutagenesis and by selection of different N-terminal and C-terminal fragments from a small or large (629) fragment collection. the prey was constructed as a fusion of the homodimerization domain of Gcn4 with NubG. ubiquitin was reconstituted and mDHFR-HA was cleaved off by ubiquitin-specific proteases. the reporter mDHFR was replaced by the hybrid transcription factor LexA-VP16. ubiquitin protein X and prey protein Y are fused to the C-terminal (Cub) and mutated (I13G) N-terminal domains, respectively, of ubiquitin. a chimera of mDHFR and the HA epitope completes the bait construct. threonine, alanine, and cysteine stabilize the protein when they are present at its N-terminal end. for PPI analysis, the LexA-VP16 construct in the bait is replaced by the reporter protein Ura3 with an arginine residue (R-Ura3) between Ura3 and Cub (708). a new strategy was suggested in which the protein gene is integrated into the genome and controlled by its native promoter (502) split-ubiquitin three-hybrid techniques were developed for expression of a bridging or competing third protein (220) and for identification of protein\u2013small-molecule interactions (134) the unique feature of ubiquitin-induced proteolysis has been exploited to control protein abundance (520), to identify the endoplasmic reticulum pores. split-mDHFR method catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate. this crucial role for DHFR in cell survival can be used for PCA applications with DHFR split into two fragments. a genome-wide S. cerevisiae PPI screening was performed in yeast. over 4,000 bait proteins were individually examined for interactions with over 4,000 prey proteins in a mating assay (633) the results were highly complementary with original two-hybrid screens and TAP-MS data. uracil-deficient medium can be used for positive selection for an interaction. dissociation of an interaction can be screened for on medium with 5-fluorocytosine, which is converted into toxic 5-fluorouridine triphosphate by a pathway dependent on yCD. luciferases from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) (484), the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) (317, 500), the copepod Gaussia princeps (542), and, more recently, the click beetle (258, 343) luciferases emit in green and red, respectively, which enables simultaneous investigation of two PPIs. split-luciferase experiments with the three proteins formed an essential part of this investigation and showed that PCAs enable quantitative and dynamic analysis of PPIs. fluorescent proteins emit light upon excitation by external light source. the split-FP method suffers from the same difficulties as traditional fluorescence experiments, such as photobleaching, phototoxicity, and autofluorescence. this irreversible chromophore formation offers the advantage of trapping weak (millimolar range) complexes (424) FP assay is important for differentiation between two proteins in close proximity. slow maturation of split-FP fragments further complicates interpretation of subcellular location of PPIs. ubiquitin-specific proteases cleave the 76-amino-acid regulatory protein. ubiquitin is recognized by ubiquitin-specific proteases that cleave the covalent linkage between ubiquitin and the protein to which it is attached. reporter mDHFR was replaced by the hybrid transcription factor LexA-VP16. after interaction of bait and prey, LexA-VP16 is cut off and moves to the nucleus. the bait protein of interest needs to be membrane bound or at least able to exclude the whole fusion construct from entering the nucleus. interaction between a membrane-bound bait X and prey Y leads to cleavage of the artificial transcription factor LexA-VP16. released LexA-VP16 localizes to the nucleus to activate reporter genes. the ambiguity of Ura3 as a reporter protein permits screening for PPIs and PPI inhibition. as with the original two-hybrid method, the split-ubiquitin system suffers from pulling out a significant number of false-positive results. this approach severely decreased the number of false-positive results. the unique feature of ubiquitin-induced proteolysis has been exploited to control protein abundance (520), to identify the endoplasmic reticulum pores that transport a specific substrate protein (150) and to eliminate cancer cells in a theoretical design based on conditional maintenance of a toxic protein-encoding vector (659). a split-ubiquitin experiment further enabled studies on altered protein conformations (148, 534) murine DHFR (mDHFR) can serve as a reporter protein in bacterial and fungal DHFR systems in which a PPI is detected by survival of the cell in the presence of methotrexate or trimethoprim. the split-mDHFR method can be used to screen for novel PPIs and forms an alternative to transcription-based two-hybrid systems. split-mDHFR screens were done with individual bait and prey strains. the classic two-hybrid experiments were performed with pooled prey strains. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate. a genome-wide S. cerevisiae PPI screening was performed. a genome-wide S. cerevisiae PPI screening was performed. over 4,000 bait proteins were individually examined for interactions with over 4,000 prey proteins in a mating assay (633) fragments of yCD followed by fusion to the human GTPase Ras and the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf led to the identification of optimized yCD fragment sequences by selection on medium lacking uracil for yCD reassembly in an fcy1 strain. the dissociation of an interaction can be screened for on medium with 5-fluorocytosine, which is converted into toxic 5-fluorouridine triphosphate. luciferases applied in PCA technologies originate from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) (484), the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) (317, 500), the copepod Gaussia princeps (542), and the click beetle (258, 343) luciferases emit in green and red, respectively, which enables simultaneous investigation of two PPIs. split-luciferase system is one of the very few PCAs with applications in living animals. luciferases are proteins that bind and catalyze the oxidation of their membrane-permeating substrate luciferin. they provide a high temporal resolution of luciferin. luciferases from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) (484), the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) (317, 500), the copepod Gaussia princeps (542) and click beetle luciferases emit in green and red, respectively, which enables simultaneous investigation of two PPIs (672) luciferases from Pyrearinus termitilluminans and Pyrophorus plagio split-luciferase system is one of the very few PCAs with applications in living animals. report on split-luciferase assays in yeast is rather scarce. split-FP method (or bimolecular fluorescence complementation) was developed in e. coli (205) and soon would become the most widespread of all PCA tools. the strength of this technique lies in its ability to detect weak interactions at a subcellular resolution. the split-FP method suffers from the same difficulties as traditional fluorescence experiments. fluorescent protein complementation of enhanced GFP (EGFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), the YFP variant Venus and the monomeric Kusabira-Green fluorescent mutant (mKG2) has been employed in yeast. initial results came from studies on the influence of hydrogen peroxide on the location of the interacting couple Rho5 GTPase and Trr1 thioredoxin reductase. fluorescent proteins emit light upon excitation by external light source. many of these fluorescent proteins were adapted for interaction analysis by splitting the proteins into two fragments attached to a protein of interest. split-FP method was originally developed in E. coli (205) and soon would become the most widespread of all PCA tools. split-FP systems come with a number of limitations. first, the split-FP method suffers from the same difficulties as traditional fluorescence experiments, such as photobleaching, phototoxicity, and autofluorescence. results from split-FP experiments need to be interpreted with extra caution. studies on the influence of hydrogen peroxide on the location of the interacting couple Rho5 GTPase and Trr1 thioredoxin reductase (602) and the dependence for the interaction between Mso1 and the Sm-like protein Sec1 on the Rab GTPase Sec4 and its activator, Bud5 (319) sec4 was later shown to interact directly with Mso1 in a split-FP assay (695) two-hybrid screening in bacteria also reduces the chance that the host possesses a eukaryotic homolog that mediates a protein association. also, the absence of endogenous proteins that compete for interactions with the bait or the prey protein increases the sensitivity of the system. two allelic variants of the E. coli LexA repressor were fused to a protein of interest (137) both variants have different binding affinities, depending on the DNA sequence in the promoter. each variant has a preference to be bound by one of the two LexA variants. repressor PhaR and the PHB granule-associated protein PhaP results in lacZ expression by recruitment of PhaR to PHB granules. chimeric fusion of prey Y with maltose-binding protein without a signal sequence (ssMBP) localizes to the periplasm only upon interaction of X with Y. active AP converts p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNP) to yellow p-nitrophenol (pNP) binding of zinc finger motif X to target DNA sequence, Y (zinc finger binding motif Zfbm Y) is facilitated by inclusion of fixed zinc fingers from Zif268 and target DNA sequence Zif268 bm. interaction between X and Y reconstitutes VDE to create an isolated GFP monomer. the EGFP structure image is based on the PDB structure under accession number 2Y0G (550) an approach combining the subunit and the Zif268 zinc finger domain is particularly suited for studies of PPIs between two monomers (655) the latter system was modified for use with Gateway entry clones. a protocol for bacterial two-hybrid experiments can be found elsewhere. epitope-tagged prey protein and bait protein anchored on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane of E. coli by fusion to a leader peptide and to the first 6 amino acids of the E. coli lipoprotein NlpA. all nonassociated prey proteins are removed in the extracellular fluid upon spheroplast induction. detecting periplasmic PPIs and cytoplasmic PPIs is possible in the ToxR-based system (357, 358, 371) in E. coli, ToxR is capable of directly activating transcription at the ctx promoter sequence. toxR-based tool has been used as an indicator of folding stability (356), interactions between transmembrane helices (553), heterodimerization in both the periplasm and cytoplasm (252), and sequence an alternative two-hybrid system in E. coli detects PPIs based on the biological folding quality control mechanism inherent to the twin-arginine transporter pathway. this mechanism relies on the export of correctly folded proteins by association with a protein carrying a Tat signal peptide (547) in the Tat two-hybrid system, one protein is fused to a Tat signal peptide and the second is fused to a protein reporter. a fixed zinc finger-DNA association can be studied by incorporation of a fixed zinc finger-DNA association that facilitates the binding of the DNA and protein of interest (314). optimized algorithms aid in enhanced predictions of binding motifs from one-hybrid studies (99) enzymatic dimerization essential to HIV infection (267) or purine synthesis (634) led to the detection of peptide inhibitors of the interactions between the tumor suppressor p53 and MDM2 or MDMX (115) and between the HIV Gag protein and human TSG101 (635) and to the elucidation of antiviral defense silencing by the influenza virus NS1 protein (451). chromosomally integrated bait and prey vectors are now available ( split-FP system was originally described for E. coli by Regan and coworkers. split-YFP method exploits irreversible behavior of FP fragment folding for detection of transient and weak interactions between individual proteins. inteins are self-splicing proteins that induce the release of reassembled GFP upon interaction of fusion proteins (485) inteins are self-splicing proteins that induce the release of reassembled GFP upon interaction of fusion proteins. bacterial two-hybrid plasmids based on recombination of adenylate cyclase were modified for easy transfer to vectors for single or double affinity purification. the system was also adapted for high-throughput screening for dimerization inhibitors of the type IV secretion protein VirB8 (495) split-CM system was created for selection on medium lacking aromatic amino acids. split-DHFR method can be used for E. coli survival selection on medium containing trimethoprim. other PCA methods include split-Trp system for E. coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis. a classic two-hybrid system was adapted for use in C. albicans (623) reporter systems, DBDs, and ADs were all compatible for application in C. albicans. it identified known and novel PPIs, not previously identified in the yeast system. the same split-EYFP vectors were recently applied in the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum (262) nuclear fluorescence was observed between two components of the Velvet-like protein complex. this interaction was not identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis. this suggests the requirement of a bridging protein to bring together the two proteins of interest. split-YFP assay in plant pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (732) kinases fused to the C-terminal and N-terminal parts of YFP. interaction between Pmk1 and Mst7 was observed in vivo in appressorium formations. YFP complementation is visible in neurons with OR83b but not in neurons lacking OR83b. yFP complementation is visible in neurons with OR83b but not in neurons lacking OR83b. yFP complementation is visible in neurons with OR83b but not in neurons lacking OR83b. spliced and reconstituted RLuc recovers its bioluminescence activity. it is imaged by using a cooled CCD camera and measured as photons per second per cm2. the differential translocation of AR in the presence (+) or absence () of DHT could hence be evaluated quantitatively. interaction between bait and prey results in repression of a luciferase reporter gene. two-hybrid method was engineered as an indicator of human estrogenic activities. transgenic A. thaliana constitutively expressing two effector proteins. split-FP assays were developed in plant cells with the development of the split-FP method. yFP complementation to detect PPIs in subcellular compartments became available in the context of living plant cells. s for simultaneous or preferential PPI detection have been adapted for plant research, based on the use of the combination of SCFP3A N- and C-terminal fragments with the Venus N-terminal fragment. multicolor expression vectors were also developed in the pSAT series of vectors to facilitate the practice of the method. meric RFP (mRFP)-based assay was recently described for the investigation of plant-virus interactions in N. benthamiana (740) the new plasmids enable fusion of proteins of interest to either the N- or C-terminal domain of the mRFP fragments. they possess a linker to improve the flexibility of the chimeric proteins. for 20% of all interactions identified by split-GFP assay, reciprocal expression of the target proteins was necessary for proper GFP refolding. the yeast two-hybrid assay detected fewer than 5% of PPIs that were not identified by the PCA technique. says based on the Renilla reniformis and Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase enzymes have been used in protoplasts and whole plants. the system was adapted to enable both transient expression of fusion proteins and generation of stable transgenic plants. two-hybrid system involves two proteins of interest fused to the yeast Gal4 DBD and to the AD of mouse nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), with firefly luciferase as the reporter gene. the system shows high sensitivity due to low background luciferase activity, with the luciferase gene placed under the control of a minimal HSP70 promoter. a split-Venus system for use in the worm was introduced by Hu and coworkers. the heat shock promoter was employed to counteract the irreversibility of the split-fluorophore approach. applications include detection of the nucleus-localized interaction between worm BRCA2 and mammalian Rad51. a reciprocity test performed by switching the identities of the bait and prey proteins showed that the interactions were retained in this assay. the split-YFP technique has also been applied in the fruit fly model for PPI detection between odorant receptors in olfactory sensory neurons. the technique detected an interaction between phosphorylated Smad proteins in vivo and in response to growth factors. some were translocated to the nucleus after addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) growth factors. this technique provides a direct and quantitative readout for activin-like signaling. a growing number of small molecules capable of disrupting designated PPIs are being uncovered. potential PPI targets outnumber single-protein targets, such as enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors, or ion channels. in-cell screening for such PPI modifiers by use of human cell-based assays offers clear advantages. the second group comprises various forms of the PCA. the third group includes techniques that are based on unique features of mammalian cells. the second group includes techniques that are based on unique features of mammalian cells. assay (CAPPIA) combines a DNA microarray with a two-hybrid readout (177) cells are seeded on top and take up the DNAs by reverse transfection. readout is subsequently performed using a DNA array scanner or by high-throughput microscopy. the mammalian two-hybrid system also has applications in drug discovery. it was suggested that high-throughput compound screening with 384-well plates should be feasible using the mammalian two-hybrid system. in a similar study, more than 3,000 compounds were screened for inhibition of the binding of MDM2 to the tumor suppressor p53. the nuclear translocation assay (NTA) uses ligand-induced redistribution of a bait-prey complex. the bait is fused to a localization-controllable EGFP construct. the prey is fused to a nuclear import signal (NLS) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor. -arrestin (675) and endocytosis (238) were tethered to endosomes, leading to reconstitution of enzymatic activity only after fusion of endosomes containing the activated GPCR complex. both assays were also adapted to high-throughput compound screening. split-luciferase systems have been used frequently in mammalian cell cultures. the reversible character of luciferase reassembly was exploited in the investigation of deassembly of protein kinase A regulatory and catalytic subunits. split-luciferase-based optical sensors have been used in small animals. imaging is then typically performed using cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras. imaging is then typically performed using cooled charge-coupled camera. multicolor split-FP assays allow for competition studies between different proteins for a shared partner. multicolor split-FP assays can also be combined with BRET or FRET readouts, allowing the study of complex formation involving up to four proteins. a panel of FP reporters selected to detect off-target effects on multiple biochemical pathways in human cells (421) the use of photoswitchable fluorophores may also be an interesting prospect for split-FP applications. the use of photoswitchable fluorophores may also be an interesting prospect for split-FP applications. a split-FP assay based on this fluorescent protein was able to localize PPIs between the cargo receptor ERGIC-53 and various glycoproteins (475). a split-FP assay based on this protein was able to localize PPIs between the cargo receptor ERGIC-53 and various glycoproteins. a second characteristic of MAPPIT that reduces the false-positive rate is its ligand dependency, which adds an additional control level. the nonstructured cytokine receptor tails provide flexibility in MAPPIT, allowing prey chimeras to be contacted easily by the JAK kinase. the bait protein is a fusion with a leptin receptor (LR) which contains three Y-to-F mutations so it is unable to activate STATs spontaneously. after interaction of the bait protein, Janus kinases (JAKs) phosphorylate gp130, which stimulates binding of gp130 with the STATs. the STAT complex binds the rat PAP1 promoter (rPAP1p) and activates prey Y fusion contains phosphatase (PaseDom) domain which removes phosphate of JAK2. inhibition of bait-prey association by competing proteins (Comp) or compounds (C) reestablishes normal JAK-STAT signaling, which ultimately leads to luciferase reporter gene transcription. a bait-prey interaction does not directly activate the reporter but functions via a reconstituted protease. this approach leads to a stable reporter activity which may affect the capture of dynamic interactions. but constitutive GABA-B1aR and GABA-B2R, as well as ligand-dependent ErbB2-ErbB4 receptor heterodimerization could be monitored. a combined yeast-bacterium two-hybrid system was engineered (578) based on the repressor DBD fused to a bait gene and placed under the control of the lpp/lacUV5 and TEF1 promoters in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. combination and reading frame-independent mammalian two-hybrid vectors were generated to be fully compatible with the site-specific yeast two-hybrid system (426, 427). this method was developed to address the shortcoming of time-consuming recloning of yeast two-hybrid candidates into mammalian two-hybrid vectors required for retesting of interacting candidates in the endogenous host environment. two-hybrid systems are based on fusions to transcriptional repressors and activators, membrane protein dimerization, complementation of biosynthetic enzymes, and export of folded proteins. the first bacterial two-hybrid systems were based upon the E. coli repressor, which confers immunity to phage infections (158, 273) this technique was recently used to confirm several prokaryotic PPIs. an adaptation of this LexA-based bacterial two-hybrid assay was created with bait vectors carrying a mobilization element (103) these vectors can be transferred efficiently by conjugation from an E. coli strain donor expressing all the necessary components for mobilization function. the V. cholerae ToxR transcriptional activator requires dimerization of its periplasmic domain for full reporter transcription activation. the periplasmic domain is replaced by two proteins of interest, X and Y. chimeric fusion of prey Y with the maltose-binding protein without a signal sequence (ssMBP) localizes to the periplasm only upon interaction of X with Y. fusion further consists of the S. cerevisiae Gal11 interaction domain (Gal11 ID) latter domain is fused to the N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase subunit. interaction between chimeric proteins of bait X with the bacteriophage cI repressor results in activation of a gene encoding the C-terminal domain of the bacteriophage 186 cI repressor. prokaryotic two-hybrid systems significantly enhanced the potential for screening experiments by selective growth. in one design, the cI protein and the subunit of RNA polymerase are employed as the DBD and AD, respectively (141, 142). the bait fusion protein represses the reporter gene lacZ by binding its promoter. interaction between bait and prey constructs tethers the bait to the PHB granules. this results in the release of lacZ expression. this method displays a reduced technical false-positive rate. fluorescence signal is a direct function of both the affinity of the interaction and the expression level of the interacting partners. one protein is fused to DivIVA from B. subtilis or FtsZ from E. coli to target a second protein, fused to GFP, to cell division sites. cholera toxin ToxR regulatory protein of Vibrio cholerae has been exploited as a genetic indicator of PPIs in E. coli. chromosomal ctx::cat in the TOXCAT system (553), chromosomal ctx::cat in the POSSYCAT system (positive selection system based on chromosomally integrated cat) to discriminate between interactions of different affinity (233), or the red fluorescent protein variant mCherry for whole-cell detection without an additional substrate (39) two reporters were used in plasmic space (621) in the first attempt. the maltose-binding protein catalyzes the formation of alkaline phosphatase. only those highly expressed and interacted strongly were able to confer -lactam antibiotic resistance to cells. the first bacterial reverse two-hybrid method was based on reporter gene repression by cI, dependent on homodimerization of a protein of interest in fusion with cI (490). it led to the
