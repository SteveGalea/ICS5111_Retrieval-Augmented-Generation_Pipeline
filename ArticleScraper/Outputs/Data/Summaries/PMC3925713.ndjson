{"summary": "there are six requirements for bioterrorism agents that are relevant here: 1) a high degree of morbidity and lethality. 2) Highly infectious microbes or highly toxic substances. 4) Easy to produce in bulk and store until delivered. 5) Reasonably hardy in the environment after distribution. the soil Spores can be viable for >40 years Fever, malaise, fatigue, cough, mild chest discomfort, respiratory distress, shock No 8000\u201350 000 spores 1\u20136 d High once symptoms appear Ciprofloxacin or doxycyline Brucellosis Genus Brucella (B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. canis) doxycycline, gentamycin Glanders B. mallei, reservoir horses, mules, donkeys Stable Fever, rigors, sweating, myalgia, headache, pleuritis, chest pain, splenomegaly, generalized popular/pustular eruptions Yes\" 10\u201314 d Varies Amoxicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfa Melioidosis Burkholderi all VHF transmitted via aerosols, exception dengue 4\u201321 d 5\u201390% case fatality rate depending on the virus Ribavirin or supportive care Ebola Four viruses: Bundibugyo virus, Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Ta Forest virus of the genus Ebolavirus. the emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to all known antibiotics represents a major challenge to human health. the emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to all known antibiotics represents a major challenge to human health. antibiotic-resistant, virulent microorganisms are particularly attractive as terrorist weapons because no security screening is in effect for common species. there are many potential bioterrorism agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and toxins that can be spread by air, water or food. human yersinia infection takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemia, and bubonic plagues. Burkholderia pseudomallei causes glanders in animals and melioidosis in humans with a mortality rate of 20\u201350%. gram-positive bacteria produce hardy endospores that can be easily disseminated. in 1979, an unusual anthrax epidemic occurred in Sverdlovsk, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. most victims worked or lived in a narrow zone extending from the military facility to the southern city limit. it was concluded that the escape of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen caused the outbreak. 280 tons of formaldehyde diluted in seawater was sprayed over all 196 hectares of the island. villagers reported an unusual massive die-off of mice and rats in 1999 in war-devastated areas. clusters and small outbreaks of a human disease with fever, lymphadenopathy, and ulcerations of skin and mucosa occurred. in 1996, 12 clinical laboratory workers developed severe acute diarrheal illness. a case of inhalational anthrax was reported in a 63-year-old male in Florida. a fourth case of cutaneous anthrax was identified in a female employee at NBC news in New York City. countermeasures against biological weapons agents can be divided into three broad classes. the first broad class is what can be loosely described as disinfectants. treatments that can destroy or neutralize the agent before it has come into contact with human beings. ultraviolet light, blue light, PDI have been shown to be effective in inactivating pathogens without harming host tissue. PUVA has been shown to be highly effective in inactivating pathogens in such a manner to make them good vaccine preparations. light has several advantages over alternative disinfectants, biocides, and anti-infectives. ultraviolet (UV) wavelength region is set between the X-ray (100 nm) and the visual (>400 nm) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. as such, UV light can be classified into four wavelengths according to its interaction with molecules: vacuum UV (VUV) at 100\u2013200 nm; UV C (UVC) at 200\u2013280 nm; UV B (UVB) at 280\u2013315 nm. pyrimidines and purines can absorb UV light and this way DNA and RNA can be inactivated by UV light, especially UVC at 254 nm by oxidation of these bases or through base dimerization. when DNA is damaged it becomes very difficult for the nucleic acids to replicate, and if replication does occur, it often produces a defect that prevents the bacterium from being viable. ultraviolet irradiation effect on microorganisms has been produced by mercury vapor arc lamps for a long time. this kind of lamp is low-pressure mercury (Hg) and are 30% efficient at converting input power to UVC at 253.7 nm. this type of lamp is low-pressure mercury (Hg) and are 30% efficient at converting input power to UVC at 253.7 nm. lla melitensis/abortus Petri dishes UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp (5 8W) 18.7 mW/cm2 and 19.5 mW/cm2 120 to 240 s 34 Staphylococcus aureus Infected wounds UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp 2.7 mW/cm2 2.59 J/cm2 (16 min) 25 Methillicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Xenon flash lamp 0.17 J/cm2 and 5.28 J/cm2 (1 to 2 min) 30 Petri dishes UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp 1.34 103 W/cm2 25 to 1000 mJ/cm2 (19 s to 12 min) Bacillus megaterium Air circulation system UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp 1870 W/cm2 to 3720 W/cm2 30 min to 48 h 31 Variola virus airborne disinfection the xenon lamp emits a peak wavelength at 240 nm. it produces ozone, which is a strong oxidant and toxic air pollutant. this lamp is a non-toxic alternative to mercury but produces ozone. UVC is an established means of disinfection and can be used to kill agents causing many infectious diseases. studies have been carried out to determine which wavelength in the UVC region is actually best to inactivate microorganisms. UV treatment is increasingly common because the process is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, overdose is not possible, chemical residues or byproducts are avoided, and water quality is unaffected. another significant use of UV light is air disinfection because a wide variety of fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens may be transmitted by airborne droplets. UVC has been installed in air-handling units in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems to irradiate the surfaces of the coil and disinfect system components. the technology and methods used in health care facilities and laboratories can also help against potential bioterrorism agents. spore film dosimeters have a spectral sensitivity profile similar to erythema-weighted data. in the study nine mountain guide instructors carried dosimeters on the sides of their heads in a total of 1406 working days throughout a year. a mixed cohort included 4 professional lifeguards of a swimming pool who carried the dosimeters laterallyally to their heads. spores of the various Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, are shown to be 5 to 50 times more resistant to UV radiation than are the corresponding growing cells. this resistance arises largely due to the use of a unique DNA repair enzyme called spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) which apparently repairs specific UV-induced DNA lesions. SP lyase is a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme that is using the (4Fe-4S)+ cluster in reducing SAM and generating the catalytic 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical (5\u2032-dA\u2022) tyrosine in B. subtilis SPL, Y99(Bs), downstream of the cysteine. UV generates few (if any) cyclobutane dimers, but rather the spore photoproduct 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine. it is an exclusive DNA photodamage product in bacterial endospores and a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme (SAM) and the SP lyase repairs it. UV light can be a viable tool against a bioterrorist action using microorganisms. the main source of UV light used to kill microorganisms has been produced by mercury vapor arc lamps for a long time. this kind of lamp is low-pressure mercury (Hg) and are 30% efficient at converting input power to UVC at 253.7 nm. lamp 2.7 mW/cm2 2.59 J/cm2 (16 min) 25 Methillicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Petri dishes UV continuous (peak at 245 and 261 nm) Xenon flash lamp (6 W) 250 W/cm2 1 to 10 s 33 Streptococcus pyogenes Petri dishes UVC 265 nm Light-emitting diode 1.93 mW illus atrophaeus air circulation system UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp 1870 W/cm2 to 3720 W/cm2 30 min to 48 h 31 Variola virus Airborne disinfection (hospital) UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp: 5 W 17 J/m2 to 68 J/m2 (10 min) 3 Ebola Petri dishes UVC 254 nm Mercury lamp: 15 W \u2014\u2014 4 J/m2 (0 to 30 s the xenon lamp emits a peak wavelength at 240 nm. it produces ozone, which is a strong oxidant and toxic air pollutant. this lamp is a non-toxic alternative to mercury but produces ozone. medium pressure mercury lamps emit a wider range of wavelengths than low pressure lamps. pulsing at 100 Hz was superior to CW for inactivating E. coli and C. alibicans biofilms. UV has successfully reduced the concentration of airborne microorganisms in operating rooms during surgery. the initial success of air disinfection by UVC in surgical rooms stimulated an expansion of UVC application in hospitals. UVC can be used for whole room disinfection, cleaning the air and surfaces under this light. biosafety is a public health concern, but most of the attention is cornered to hospital environments and microbiology laboratories. bioterrorism concerns have not so far become familiar to the public. biological UV dosimeters is widely accepted that biological UV dosimetry is an indicative tool for assessing the UV impact on health and ecosystems. nine mountain guide instructors carried dosimeters on the sides of their heads in a total of 1406 working days throughout a year. in another study by the same group44 they tested the practical application of the \u201cbiological UV dosimeters\u201d on 11 persons in a span of 43 d, under different UV exposure conditions that were spread over 5 different geographical regions. resistance to UV radiation is largely due to the use of a unique DNA repair enzyme called spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) it apparently repairs specific UV-induced DNA lesions through a radical-based mechanism. SP lyase is a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme. two conserved tyrosines may be critical for enzymes catalytic activity. one tyrosine in B. subtilis SPL, Y99(Bs), is downstream of the cysteine. the second tyrosine, Y97(Bs), has a structural role. the unique UV photochemistry of spore DNA is due to its saturation with a group of small, acid-soluble proteins. this SP-specific repair is also unique to spores and is performed by a light-independent SP-lyase. resistance of vegetative bacteria to UV photoinactivation can also be developed. UV light can be a viable tool against a bioterrorist action using these microorganisms. the use of UVC irradiation can be used in vivo to treat mouse models of infections caused by virulent and pathogenic microorganisms. oxidation of pollutants.63,64 Photocatalytic surfaces can be manufactured into construction and building materials65. some of the commercial uses include self-cleaning windows and self-cleaning glass covers for road lights. photocatalytic process implies photon-assisted generation of catalytically active ROS rather than an action of the light as a catalyst in the reaction. majority of studies have shown that anatase is the most effective photocatalyst while rutile is less active. differences are probably due to differences in the extent of recombination of e and hole between the two forms. matsunaga and colleagues69,70 were the first to use TiO2 photocatalysts to kill microorganisms. previous studies have investigated the antibacterial abilities of visible light-responsive photocatalysts using the bacteria Escherichia coli and human pathogens. the spore-forming B. cereus is genetically very closely related to B. anthracis whereas B. subtilis is highly resistant to variety of stress factors. it has been suggested that the photocatalytic killing mechanism initially damages the weak points at the bacterial cell surface before total breakage of the cell membranes. visible light-responsive TiO2 photocatalysts are more convenient than traditional UV light-responsive TiO2 photocatalysts because they do not require harmful UV light irradiation to function. recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers is a major limitation in the use of TiO2 as a photocatalyst and an initiator in the photocatalytic process. carbon-doped TiO2 and modified with platinum (IV) chloride complexes used as suspension or immobilized at surfaces (infected with the microorganisms) the photocatalyst.85-89 in some cases has been used as a dopant and as such allowing not only visible light absorption but also \u201cinjecting\u201d active trap sites. studies investigated the enhancement in the rate of destruction of bacterial spores on metal (aluminum) substrates with metal (silver)-doped titanium dioxide showed complete inactivation of B. cereus spores with enhanced photocatalyst effectiveness. the enhanced spore destruction rate may be attributed to the highly oxidizing radicals generated by the doped TiO2.97. photocatalyzed spores have 10-fold less potency to induce mortality in mice. these results suggest that photocatalysis may be effective in inducing injuries to the spores through inactivating some spore components. a mixture of anatase/rutile carbon doped TiO2 nanoparticles show significantly enhanced bactericidal effect. these nanoparticles (with higher bacterial interaction property) have significantly higher proportion of bacteria-killing effect over all tested pathogens (including S. aureus, Shigella flexneri, and A. baumannii) Bacillus brevis spores were slightly more sensitive to UVB and UVC than the spores of Bacillus atrophaeus. photocatalytic sterilization against spores was strongest in UVC and UVB. psoralen molecule has the correct structure and shape to be able to intercalate between the two strands of DNA in the double helix. the psoralen molecules induce the formation of covalent inter-strand cross-linking between opposite nucleic acid strands. PUVA has been used for the inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. KMBA were developed by removing the genes required for nucleotide excision repair (uvrAB) and rendering microbial-based vaccines sensitive to photochemical inactivation with PUVA. recombinant psoralen-inactivated Lm uvrAB vaccines induced potent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. KBMA B. anthracis vaccines were found to be avirulent in mice. they induced less injection site inflammation than recombinant protective antigen adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide gel. KBMA vaccines are well tolerated and elicit potent protective immune responses. uvrAB was inactivated by photochemical treatment. it was found that the killed B. anthracis AP422uvrAB maintained a metabolic activity for at least 4 h, showing a state of KBMA. the KBMA strain of B. anthracis AP422uvrAB provided the prospective vaccine candidate strain for anthrax. in vitro, KBMA L. infantum chagasi retained the ability to enter macrophages and induce nitric oxide production. these characteristics correlated with the ability to prophylactically protect mice via subcutaneous vaccination at levels similar to vaccination with live, virulent organisms. photochemical treatment with amotosalen combined with UVA light could be used to inactivate B19. no infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one-third of the APC unit was assayed. psoralen-inactivated deNV-1 was reported to be immunogenic in non-human primates with a reduction in days of viremia following experimental challenge. psoralen-inactivated deNV-1 was reported to be immunogenic in mice with a reduction in days of viremia. early symptoms of anthrax can last 1 to 6 days and resemble the flu. but once the bugs multiply, the body goes into shock and death can occur in 24 to 36 h. successful phototherapy studies against virulent bacteria are needed to defeat biological warfare. clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori. blue light has recently attracted much attention in comparison to photodynamic therapy as an alternative antimicrobial approach142 due to its intrinsic antimicrobial properties. blue light can regulate bacterial motility, suppress biofilm formation, and potentiate light inactivation of bacteria. visible light has a clear advantage due to well-recognized risk of UV in skin damage and cancer. a blue light with absolute dose 23.5 J/cm2 caused 2.4 log10 reductions of methicillin-resistance S. aureus. a blue light with absolute dose 23.5 J/cm2 caused 2.4 log10 reductions of methicillin-resistance S. aureus. blue light studies with the wavelength of 415 10 nm in a mouse skin abrasion model infected with hospital-acquired MRSA were highly successful135. the required light fluence was 10- to 100-fold less than the light dose exposure needed for the equivalent bacterial inactivation in vitro. gunn rats (30 9% vs. 35 2%) were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. bilirubin photodegradation was significantly higher than conventional phototherapy in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. antimicrobial photodynamic-inactivation (PDI) and therapy has been developed as a prolific discovery and development platform. it was found that there was a fundamental difference in susceptibility to PDT between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the outer membrane forms a physical and functional barrier between the cell and its environment. in the outer membrane, several different proteins are present. some of them function as pores to allow passage of nutrients. others have an enzymatic function or are involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the outer membrane. PDI is effective in MRSA even when carried with non-coherent red light and polyethylenimine (PEI)-ce6 (2.7 logs of killing) 173 PDI is effective in MRSA even when carried with non-coherent red light and polyethylenimine (PEI)-ce6. the gram-negative bacteria Brucella abortus and F. tularensis are responsible for extremely dangerous infections, brucellosis and tularaemia. both bacteria were inactivated when illuminated with a 650 nm LED. phenothiazinium new methylene blue N and phenoxazinium Brilliant Cresyl Blue showed bactericidal activity at lower concentrations than both of the established phenothiaziniums. the photoactivity of these compounds was undiminished in the presence of red blood cells. macrophages play a pivotal role in the detection and elimination of pathogenic microorganisms by phagocytosis. PDI has also been studied in models of third degree burn infections by S. aureus188 and A. baumannii.189,190 The effectiveness of PDI has also been demonstrated in deep established soft tissue abscesses caused by S. aureus. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis spores were much less sensitive and needed concentrations as high as 1.6 mM to achieve killing of >99.9% of cells and B. megaterium. the relatively mild conditions needed for spore killing could have applications for treating wounds contaminated by anthrax spores. spores of C. immitis are eukaryotic cells that possess a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. in vivo the spores enlarge to form spherules that are typically 20 microns or more in diameter when viewed in tissue sections of actively infected hosts. there have been no reports of PDI on actual C. immitis. Junqueira et al.208 reported on the use of a cationic nanoemulsion of zinc 2,9,16,23-tetrakis(phenylthio)-29H, 31H-phthalocyanine to mediate PDI of biofilms formed by Candida spp. and the emerging pathogens Trichosporon mucoides and Kodamaea ohmeri. PDI of viruses has been of special interest for applications in blood banking sterilization. several types of virus have been tested for PDI. most known human infections with these viruses have been fatal. the last occurrence of endemic smallpox was in Somalia in 1977. there are four types of Variola major smallpox: ordinary (the most frequent type), modified (mild and occurring in previously vaccinated persons); flat; and hemorrhagic (both rare and very severe) adenovirus was inactivated using MB (2.7 mM) and light (intensity of 106 mW/cm2). 10 mM of RB was enough for just 0.5 log reduction after 20 min PDI with UP. alPcS4 could not completely inactivate adenovirus even when used in 50 mM for 30 min. the amount of dengue virus reaming was evaluated by plaque forming assays. asymmetric isomer had greater dark activity due to its interaction with the lipid envelope of the virus. toxins PDI is one of the few antimicrobial treatments that is also capable of inactivating toxins and secreted virulence factors produced by pathogens. botulinum neurotoxin could be photoinactivated by exposure to riboflavin and white light. two additional microbial toxins, Shiga-like toxin from E. coli O157 and mycolactone from Mycobacterium ulcerans can be destroyed by exposure to benzoporphyrin derivative. gram-positive bacteria are bound to outer membrane of gram-negative cells. the outer membrane forms a physical and functional barrier between the cell and its environment. in the outer membrane, several different proteins are present. kill 19 000 hospitalized american patients annually; equivalent to combined number of deaths due to AIDS, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis. some MRSA strains contain particular genetic backgrounds or factors that enhance their virulence. PDI is effective in MRSA even when carried with non-coherent red light and polyethylenimine (PEI)-ce6 (2.7 logs of killing) 173 PDI is effective in MRSA even when carried with non-coherent red light and polyethylenimine (PEI)-ce6. gram-negative bacteria Brucella abortus and F. tularensis are responsible for extremely dangerous infections, brucellosis and tularaemia. both bacteria were inactivated when illuminated with a 650 nm LED. no killing effect was observed eliminating the possibility of photothermal damage. macrophages are immune cells that play a pivotal role in the detection and elimination of pathogenic microorganisms by phagocytosis. many pathogens, such as Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Yersinia pestis, parasitize macrophages. PDI can have high selectivity for bacterial cells compared with host mammalian cells it is particularly suited as a treatment for localized infections. anthrax is particularly deadly to humans due to the bacterium\u2019s ability to produce toxins with a sophisticated mechanism for killing mammalian cells. spores of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis were most susceptible. oliveira et al.198 demonstrated that B. cereus endospores could be inactivated by porphyrin PS and light. there was a much smaller difference in sensitivity between spores and vegetative cells of B. subtilis. 159,184 The PS is topically applied into the infected tissue. it is then illuminated after a relatively short incubation time to ensure the PS is bound to the bacteria but has not had time to gain access to the host cells. PDI has also been studied in models of third degree burn infections by S. aureus188 and A. baumannii. thiazinium salts could photoinactivate 4 species of Bacillus spores that are surrogates to B. anthracis,196. spores of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis were the most susceptible. PDI induced oxidative damage which killed up to 6 log (>99.9999%) within a total treatment time of 10 s. similar experiment performed with only a single light flash (10 or 20 J/cm2) and 10 mol of TMPyP was able to kill more than 4 log of B. atrophaeus. there are literature reports of PDI of a few species of fungus. there have been no reports of PDT on actual C. immitis organisms. the successful eradication of related fungal species suggests that PDT should work well against this pathogen. the results from Wong et al.213 showed that even a non-enveloped virus can be efficiently inactivated due to the damage induced by PDI to its viral proteins. the effectiveness of different types of PS in viral PDI has been proved for different types of mammalian viruses. smallpox has been used as a biowarfare agent in the past. it is known that smallpox has been used as a biowarfare agent in the past. PDI of HIV-1 acts on HIV-1 at different target sites. four PS (MB, rose bengal [RB] [Fig. 5H], uroporphyrin [UP] and aluminum phthalocynine tetrasulphonate [AlPcS4] could inactivate adenovirus. nucleic acids may be important targets for photoinactivation of DNA viruses. Lassa virus and RVF virus are enveloped RNA viruses. dengue virus could be inactivated using MB in combination with a LED cluster. dengue virus could be inactivated using MB in combination with a LED cluster. smallpox has been used as a biowarfare agent in the past. it is known that smallpox has been used as a biowarfare agent. adenovirus can be inactivated efficiently by singlet oxygen generating agents such as PDI. four PS (MB, rose bengal [RB]], uroporphyrin [UP] and aluminum phthalocynine tetrasulphonate [AlPcS4] could inactivate adenovirus. sa virus (Arenavirus) and RVF virus (Bunyaviridae) Lassa virus (LASV) is an Arenavirus that causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever in human and non-human primates. Lassa virus is caused by RVF virus belonging to Bunyaviridae, which is a family of negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. microbial toxins can be destroyed by exposure to benzoporphyrin derivative and red light. microbial toxins can be destroyed by exposure to benzoporphyrin derivative and red light (manuscript in preparation) the femtosecond laser has been hypothesized to be a new approach for killing pathogens. the femtosecond laser has been hypothesized to be a new approach for killing pathogens. 234-240 phages were inactivated by using a very low power (as low as 0.5 nJ/pulse) visible femtosecond laser with 425 nm wavelength, 100 fs pulse width, power density 50 MW/cm2 237. the laser produced a continuous train of 60 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. the laser irradiation caused a 5-log reduction in MCMV titer and caused selective aggregation of viral capsid and tegument proteins. however, the femtosecond laser did not cause significant changes to the global structure of MCMV virions including membrane and capsid. it could not produce the double-strand breaks or crosslinking in MCMV genomic DNA. light-mediated technology is highly likely to be very broad-spectrum, thus avoiding the need to know the identity of the particular agent in any mass biological attack. light-mediated technology is highly likely to be very broad-spectrum, thus avoiding the need to know the identity of the particular agent in any mass biological attack."}
