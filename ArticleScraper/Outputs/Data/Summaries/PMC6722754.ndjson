{"summary": "two pathogens affecting cattle and sheep were responsible for major outbreaks in Mainland Europe in the past 15 years. the diseases were previously either never reported in such northern locations (bluetongue virus) or recently discovered (Schmallenberg virus); both viruses displayed the ability to cross the placental barrier. study of pathogenicity, virulence, pathogenesis, and transplacental infections in ruminant hosts proved valuable tool to study pathogenicity, virulence, pathogenesis, and transplacental infections. a special emphasis will be given to placental crossing and teratogenic potential of these two viruses. the origin of the inoculum and its passage history must be carefully evaluated. the number of passages, the cell culture system used to grow the inoculum or by contrast, infectious blood or serum source are central to achieve experimental infection matching virological, clinical, and serological parameters. cula characteristics used in the 10 most recent experimental infection studies on BTV and SBV. only articles about experimental infection involving at least one ruminant species were retained. number of infected animals only takes into account actually infected ones. cell-passaged 10 sheep and 4 cattle KC 2 SC, ID 1 107 Darpel et al., 2016 [18] BTV8 Blood 8 sheep / / ID 2 106.08 Drolet et al., 2015 [19] BTV8 BTV16 Cell-passaged 37 sheep KC 3 and 2 SC 3 not possible Br\u00e9ard et al., 2015 [20] SBV Cell-passaged 13 cattle BHK-21 4 SC 10 105 Ksik the first and most obvious hypothesis to explain the mild severity of bluetongue disease in the experiment is the use of culture grown virus. KC cells better mimic natural vector-borne infection compared to virus passaged on other cell lines. despite lack of changes in the consensus sequence, the passage of BTV in Culicoides cells induces an increase of the number of low-frequency variants. this phenomenon has been hypothesized to explain the reduced viraemia and clinical picture seen in the re-emerging BTV8 in 2017 versus the 2007 strain. a year later the same team concluded to the suitability of both infectious serum and low passage cell culture material for SBV experimental challenges in sheep. the origin of the isolated virus seems to be of importance as virus originating from the central nervous system failed to reproduce RNAemia in inoculated animals. vector species the route might be intradermal (ID), subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) in experimental infections the inoculated viral load and volume are usually higher than those inoculated through naturally occurring feeding given the size of the arthropods and the size of their mouthparts. the lack of vector saliva components can modify the structure and infectivity of Reoviridae and Peribunyaviridae viral particles. intradermal inoculation is required to multiply inoculation sites to reach desired total inoculum volume and infectious titre. the most practical tools are Dermojet\u00ae (Akra Dermojet) or special syringes for intradermal injections. these devices allow usually volumes between 0.1 and 0.4 mL, thus the need for multiple injections to reach the common 1\u20134 mL inoculation volume used in ruminant infectious challenges experiments. no statistical differences were found in the duration or quantity of viral RNA circulating in blood, nor in the amount of viral RNA present in virus positive lymphoid organs. no significant differences in viraemia kinetics could be found [65]. the infection of Culicoides is particularly tricky given the size of the insect. the subcutaneous route seems to represent the best compromise for BTV and SBV. the dose itself must be sufficient but there is no gain in using massive viral load. literature does not report experimental infections with a BTV2 inoculum that was contaminated by another virus belonging to the same or a different family. despite the transient circulation of BTV6 [77], BTV11 [76] and BTV14 [78] of vaccine origin in Europe, the BTV11 contamination here above mentioned happened to be similar to BTV11 reference strain. ogenesis of diseases was essential to investigate vaccine efficacy requirements or certain specific aspects of the pathogenesis of recently discovered viruses. in most recent experimental infections involving BTV or SBV, cell culture grown inocula were preferred for challenges. the number of infected animals only takes into account actually infected ones. 1 BTV2 BTV4 BTV9 BTV16 Cell-passaged 30 cattle BHK-21 2-4 SC 2,5-4 106 Martinelle et al., 2018 [14] BTV27 Cell-passaged blood (goat) 7 sheep, 13 goats and 4 cattle BSR; ECE+BSR 3; 1+3 or 1+2 SC; IV (blood) 2, 3 or 4; 1 (blood) 103\u2013104.67 Br\u00e9ard et al., 2018 [10 SBV Serum (cattle) 25 goats / / SC 1 / Laloy et al., 2017 [24] SBV Plasma 9 sheep / / IV 20 not specified Rodrguez-Prieto et al., 2016 [25] SBV Serum (cattle) 5 sheep / / SC 1 103.3 Poskin et al., 2015 [27] SBV Serum (cattle) 9 sheep / / SC, ID, IN KC cells better mimic natural vector-borne infection compared to virus passaged on other cell lines. RNA viruses also generate genomic variations through recombination and reassortment. Culicoides saliva was demonstrated to contain a trypsin-like protease able to cleave VP2 leading to infectious subviral particles formation with enhanced infectivity. other authors concluded to the benefits of culture-grown viruses to be used in experimental challenges in ruminants. the choice of the route of inoculation can be driven by two main considerations: (1) the need for a route that best mimics the behaviour of the vector in field conditions. in experimental infections the inoculated viral load and volume are usually higher than the ones inoculated through naturally occurring feeding given the size of the arthropods and the size of their mouthparts. authors used mixed routes to overcome disadvantages of each approach. compared intranasal, intradermal and subcutaneous routes for experimental infections of ewes with SBV. most of the cellular and fluid exchanges between the skin and the blood do occur in the dermis. we investigated the intranasal route to test whether or not a potential direct SBV contamination between sheep could be achieved. several authors reported a direct link between the inoculated viral doses and the onset of clinical signs and viraemia. the use of Culicoides to perform experimental challenges remains highly limited by practical constraints. the subcutaneous route seems to represent the best compromise for BTV and SBV. the infection of Culicoides is particularly tricky given the size of the insect and the exact amount of virus delivered to each ruminant cannot be known. a case of BTV11 contamination was reported by ANSES in the context of an experimental infection of goats with BTV8. it appeared to be very closely related to the BTV11 isolated in Belgium. this particular inoculum has been previously involved in two other experimental infections. the inoculum is far from related to an ongoing viral circulation. such a recommendation would inevitably increase the constraints and costs of quality control of inocula prior to their use in experimental infections. extensive screening could however be considered on a case-by-case basis.

KC cells better mimic natural vector-borne infection compared to virus passaged on other cell lines. despite lack of changes in the consensus sequence, the passage of BTV induces an increase of the number of low-frequency variants as well as an increase in virulence. this phenomenon has been hypothesized to explain the reduced viraemia and clinical picture seen in the re-emerging BTV8 in 2017 versus the 2007 strain. serial passages can lead to attenuation, increased virulence, or efficient propagation with a low frequency of nucleotide exchanges. the choice of the route of inoculation can be driven by two main factors: (1) the need for a route that best mimics the behaviour of the vector in field conditions. the need for a route that will ensure the virus to reach the blood stream may be relevant. inoculation of the virus alone or at a distal site from the vector feeding site could result in a failed infection. the most practical tools are Dermojet\u00ae (Akra Dermojet) or special syringes for intradermal injections. these devices allow usually volumes between 0.1 and 0.4 mL. this means the need for multiple injections to reach the common 1\u20134 mL inoculation volume used in ruminant infectious challenges experiments. di Gialleonardo et al. compared three groups of cattle inoculated with 100-fold dilutions of BTV8. no significant differences in viraemia kinetics could be found. in 1992, modified live vaccines against canine distemper, canine parainfluenza, and canine parvovirus led to abortions in several bitches. a virus could be isolated and eventually identified as BTV serotype 11. this particular inoculum has been previously involved in two other experimental infections. despite the transient circulation of BTV6 [77], BTV11 [76], and BTV14 [78] of vaccine origin in Europe, the BTV11 contamination here above mentioned happened to be similar to BTV11 reference strain. a recommendation would inevitably increase the constraints and costs of quality control of inocula prior to their use in experimental infections. papillae in the uterine glands immobilize the conceptus and it starts to elongate. binucleate cells start to differentiate and migrate (cattle: 20-22 dpc; sheep: 16\u201318 dpc). key events in sheep and cattle embryos/foetuses with particular emphasis on nervous and immune systems. three brain vesicles visible 24\u201325 17 Placentoma are detectable 32\u201336 21 Lymphoid development of the thymus 42 36 Spleen development 55 43\u201344 Peripheral lymph nodes 60 45 IgM containing cells 59 65 Myelin sheath acquisition (starting) 60 54\u201363 IgG containing cells 145 87 With dpc, the days post coitum; IgG, immunoglobin M; I the embryo develops tissues and organ structures from the three original germ layers. the foetal phase is characterized by a fast growth of the conceptus. in cattle and sheep the foetogenesis starts around 45 and 38 dpc, respectively. negative in both SBV antibodies and RTqPCR were born from seropositive mothers. none of these evocative lesions was reported either in the BTV pregnant heifers study or in the SBV pregnant ewes study. transplacental transmission of BTV8 based on field data was reported to range from 16% [105,106] to 35%. in experimental infections, passage of BTV8 from the mother to the foetus could be demonstrated in 43% of infected ewes. anencephaly/porencephaly type lesions have been observed for infection at 249 days of gestation. it appears foetuses less than two months old (after conception) could be protected from in utero infection. in contrast to SBV torticollis was hardly seen after a BTV8 in utero infection during the BTV epidemic in 2006\u20132009. common in utero malformations and nervous lesions following in utero infection with bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV), SBV, BTV, Akabane virus (AKAV), or Aino virus (AV) in ruminants. most of the spontaneous embryo mortalities occur in the early embryonic life. BTV8 was reported to increase the 56-days-return to service rate and the number of AI required to achieve pregnancy. the number of AI to get cattle pregnant was slightly yet significantly increased regardless of whether or not they were part of a herd reporting malformations indicative of an actual infection. however, congenital malformations underestimate the actual rates of BTV and SBV transplacental infections. the most objective parameter to assess a vaccine efficacy against a virus is the evaluation of the viral RNA detection by RTqPCR in the host target. the results provided in our latest studies provide new insights in viruses that spread through Europe causing severe losses in livestock industry. ruminant host species in experimental infections especially with BSL3 Culicoides borne pathogens is very expensive, time consuming, subject to stringent animal welfare constraints."}
