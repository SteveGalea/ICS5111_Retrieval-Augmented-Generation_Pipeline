{"summary": "autophagy is a degradative cellular process that degrades nonspecific cytosolic cargo. autophagy occurs in several key steps, starting with the formation of the phagophore/omegasome. autophagosome is acidified by fusion with an acidic late endosome, leading to an amphisome. autophagy cargo receptors such as SQSTM1 bring cargo into the forming phagophore and bind to LC3 via the LC3 interaction region (LIR) domain. eventual expansion of the double membrane around cytosolic cargo forms the characteristic double-membrane vesicle known as the autophagosome. Upon acidification, the amphisome can fuse with a lysosome to bring in the degradative enzymes that degrade the lipidation-dependent band shift of LC3 on a Western blot is widely used as a marker of autophagy induction (5). LC3 flux assay was developed that inhibits lysosomal proteases and allows for a measure of induction. autophagy related 1 gene (ATG1) has a serine/threonine kinase domain (11) ATG1 also contains regulatory domains that enhance binding with yeast scaffold protein autophagy related 13 (Atg13p) or inhibit kinase activity through Tor (13, 15). there have been reports of autophagy induction that is not dependent on the MTOR-ULK1/2 signaling axis. this review highlights that while ULK1/2 play pivotal roles in autophagy and in development, they are not the only kinases that induce bona fide (degradative) autophagy. the roles of the ULK1/2 and BECN1 complexes have not been determined. HBx induces ROS (light purple arrows) which activate JNK signaling and induce incomplete autophagy via BECN1. human coronavirus transmembrane papain-like proteases interact with BECN1 to induce incomplete autophagy. RB1CC1 colocalizes with ATG5, a known member of the LC3 lipidation complex. loss of RB1CC1 inhibits autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. mammalian gene shares weak homology with yeast. the loss of ATG101 inhibits autophagy induction due to instability of the complex. RB1CC1 contains conserved serine/threonine kinase (S/TK) domains and conserved C-terminal domains that are crucial for binding with RB1CC1. AMPK activates ULK1 by phosphorylating serine 317 and 777 (27, 38) phosphorylation at serine 757 by MTORC1 disrupts ULK1-AMPK interactions. AMPK activates chaperones that inhibit MTORC1 as well as directly inactivating MTOR. tol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4 (PIK3R4) exist in multiple complexes under homeostatic conditions. PIK3C3 activity is regulated by the interactions with the other complex members. RB1CC1 coimmunoprecipitates with ULK1 or ULK2 independently of kinase activity. RB1CC1 colocalizes with ATG5, a known member of the LC3 lipidation complex. loss of RB1CC1 does not impact ULK1-ATG13 binding. autophagy-related 101 (ATG101) was found to interact with the ULK1 complex. ATG101 interacts with ATG13 and RB1CC1. the loss of ATG101 inhibits autophagy induction due to instability of the complex. LK2 was shown to phosphorylate the kinases to prevent autophagy induction. MTOR forms a complex, known as MTORC1, composed of regulatory-associated protein of MTOR complex 1 (RPTOR), MTOR-associated protein LST8 (MLST8), AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1), and DEP domain containing MTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) ULK1 regulates the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex composed of BECN1, PIK3C3, ATG14, and PIK3R4. the major downstream target of the ULK1/2 complex is the beclin 1 (BECN1) complex, composed of BECN1, autophagy-related 14 (ATG14), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK LC3-I is converted to membrane-bound LC3-II. the phagophore begins expansion into a closed autophagosome. there are several reports of autophagy induction that does not require MTOR inhibition. nih 3T3 cells starved by deprivation of amino acids, glucose, and serum for 2 to 4 h respond to addition of glucose by inducing autophagic signals. TG promotes upstream autophagy induction signals but does not induce degradative autophagy. hypoxia triggers autophagy induction but not degradative autophagy. NP cells under hypoxic conditions do not respond further to rapamycin treatment. AMPK-independent autophagy induction may be explained by altered signaling. 1 were screened for WIPI1 puncta and LC3 puncta as markers of autophagic induction against a library of chemicals known to disrupt calcium transport (59). AMPK1/AMPK2 knockout MEFs induce autophagic signals, as measured by LC3 lipidation, LC3 flux assays, and quantification of LC3 puncta, under low-glucose conditions before inducing apoptosis. AMPK does not significantly increase LC3-II levels or LC3 punctum formation. AMPK inhibits ULK1 by phosphorylating ULK1 at serine 555. AMPK is not an absolute requirement for autophagy induction. addition of 3-MA to PGE2-treated MSCs inhibits autophagic signals. also, knockdown of BECN1, cyclin E, or mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 inhibits cAMP-induced autophagic signals. PIK3 inhibitor LY294002 abolished autophagy in starved NIH 3T3 cells fed glucose. TG treatment triggers unfolded protein response in the ER. it was not until after reference 49 that TG was found to be a potent inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. TG is hypothesized to work as an inhibitor of flux by inhibiting SERCA. deprivation of amino acids, glucose, and serum for 2 to 4 h respond to glucose addition. other targets, such as p70S6K and ULK1, are not phosphorylated. inhibition of glycolysis, via sodium oxamate, blocks autophagy. NP cells under basal conditions treated with torin fail to induce autophagy. altered AMPK signaling can be bypassed under conditions that are not directly related to starvation or metabolite addition. AMPK1/AMPK2 knockout MEFs induce autophagic signals. this was measured by LC3 lipidation, LC3 flux assays, and quantification of LC3 puncta. this type of autophagy induction was shown to be sensitive to 3-methyladenine treatment. AMPK inhibits ULK1 by phosphorylating ULK1 at serine 555. it also inhibits lysosome activity and autophagy flux. AMPK is not an absolute requirement for autophagy induction. knockdown of BECN1, cyclin E, or mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibits cAMP-induced autophagic signals, suggesting a role for MAPK1-cyclin E signaling inducing autophagy. PIK3 inhibitor abolished autophagy in starved NIH 3T3 cells fed glucose. an increasing number of reports have illustrated that while ULK1/2 may induce autophagy, they are not absolute requirements. this suggests that autophagy induction by glucose starvation is ULK1/2 independent (63) DT40 cells or mice treated with palmitate or oleate fatty acids induce autophagy in vitro and in vivo. oleate induces ULK1/2-independent autophagy but not oleate. AMPK regulates PIK3C3 complexes during nutrient starvation. AMPK directly phosphorylates BECN1 at threonine 388. this phosphorylation is required for glucose starvation autophagy induction. AMPK does not constitute the only possible bypass of the ULK1 complex. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus encode PLPs that induce a similar response that is independent of the protease activity of PLPs. Knockdown of BECN1 inhibits PLP-induced autophagic signals, as well as inhibiting viral replication of PEDV. x overexpression or during HBV infection suggests ROS is induction signal. poliovirus (PV) induces autophagic signals independently of ULK1/2. PV mediates instability of the ULK1/2 complex, as protein levels decrease during infection. amino acid starvation fails to induce autophagy in DT40 cells. but glucose starvation still induces autophagy in these cells. this suggests that autophagy induction by glucose starvation is ULK1/2 independent. ULK1 and ULK2 knockdown affects palmitate induction of autophagy but not oleate. one possible mechanism of ULK1/2 bypass would require direct interaction with downstream autophagy complexes. AMPK regulates PIK3C3 complexes during nutrient starvation (66) AMPK does not constitute the only possible bypass of the ULK1 complex. beCN1 is phosphorylated by multiple kinases, many of which may have an impact on autophagy signaling. asterisk reflects tentative connection of MAPK1/3 to S15 of BECN1. coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus encode PLPs that induce a similar response that is independent of the protease activity of PLPs. Knockdown of BECN1 inhibits PLP-induced autophagic signals, as well as inhibiting viral replication of PEDV. poliovirus induces autophagic signals, as measured by LC3 lipidation and WIPI1 puncta, independently of ULK1/2. PV mediates instability of the ULK1/2 complex, as protein levels of all members decrease during infection. MCF-7 cells treated with astemizole-histamine undergo apoptosis. SQSTM1 levels dropped with AST-HIS treatment. this suggests a BECN1-independent pathway of autophagy induction. proliferation of the colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 is inhibited by the extract of Rhus coriaria (RCE), more commonly known as the Sicilian sumac (85). intriguingly, BECN1 levels decrease, in a dose-dependent manner, in these cells. knockdown of BECN1 has no effect on RCE induction of autophagy. autophagy induction and required components vary depending on the type of induction signal and the types of cells used. there is a difference between amino acid, glucose, and serum deprivation. even pathogens that benefit from the autophagy pathway have different requirements. no 57 Glucose starvation Embryonic fibroblasts (MS) AMPK ULK1/2 complex. no 79 Hepatitis B virus infection HEK-293T (HU), HeLa (HU), MCF-7 (HU) ULK1/2 complex BECN1 complex. question marks indicate that the requirement for the marked proteins or whether the condition led to degradative autophagy was not assessed."}
