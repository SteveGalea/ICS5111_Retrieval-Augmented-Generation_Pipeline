{"summary": "four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type base-pairing to yield G-quartets. stacking of at least two G-quartets leads to G4 formation, through - interactions between aromatic systems of G-quartets. potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) are clustered at definite genomic regions. genome is converted from RNA to DNA during the virus replication cycle. the suffix word \u201cviridae\u201d for each virus family has been omitted. the presence of G4s in viruses and their involvement in virus key steps is increasingly evident in most of the Baltimore groups. iency virus (HIV), a retrovirus belonging to group 6 (Table 1) [28\u201335], and [33, 34]in the LTR region of lentiviruses in general (ssRNA RT) [36] were grouped in 7 classes according to Baltimore classification. the analysis is performed at two distinct levels, globally for each viral genome and individually for each detected PQS. the complete list of reference sequences for each virus included in the analyses is reported in S1 Table. PQSs in viral genomes were searched by looking for the following patterns: [G(2)N(1\u20137)](3)G(2), [G(3)N(1\u201312)](3)G(3) and [G(4)N(1\u201312)](3)G(4). both islands and loop lengths were chosen to provide a comprehensive detection. negative strand of retroviruses, ssDNA viruses and both strands of dsDNA viruses showed the largest presence of PQSs made of GG-, GGG- and GGGG-islands. dsRNA and RT viruses notably lacked the presence of PQSs. we computed the \u201cG4 scaffold conservation index\u201d (G4_SCI) for each PQS in each virus species. this value measures the degree of conservation of G-islands that are necessary and sufficient to form a PQS. the higher the score, the higher the conservation of the PQS. PQSs formed by GG-islands in the S segment of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are shown. the height of bars represents the G4_SCI (the conservation of G-islands) to assess the results, we retrieved all the available experimentally validated G4s detected in human viruses. we compared the results obtained from real viral genomes with those obtained by two different simulation strategies. the first one (single nucleotide assembling) assumes that the occurrence of each DNA base in the genome is independent. the second (G-island reshuffling) considers that short sequences of a given length (k-mer) could be over-represented in certain viral genomes. the number of viruses whose median PQS count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in S3 Table) the number of viruses whose median count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in S3 Table) with the indication of whether this median count is either higher or lower than the PQS count in simulated sequences. values and percentages were calculated considering only viruses containing at least one PQS in real or simulated sequences. most members of the dsDNA, ssDNA, and ssRNA present a highly significant content of PQSs formed by GG-, GGG- and/or GGGG-islands in one or both strands. some viruses belonging to Herpesviridae are statistically enriched in PQSs. this suggests that simply having a high G/C content is not a sufficient condition to justify the presence of such a high number of PQSs. the results obtained independently from the two simulation strategies are concordant. the overall number of viruses whose PQS content is significantly different is higher when real viral genomes are compared to those generated by single nucleotide assembling. genome coordinates were extracted for coding sequences (CDS), repeat regions (RR), 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-untranslated (UTR) and promoter regions. genome annotations of genes and CDSs were exploited to indirectly extract the coordinates of 5\u2019\u2013and 3\u2019\u2013regulatory regions. HIV-1, belonging to ssRNA (RT) virus class, presents PQSs of the GGG-island type mainly in the RR and 3\u2019-regulatory regions and in part in CDS. the most stringent PQSs of the GGGG type, present only in herpesviruses (dsDNA) and HTLV-1 (ssRNA) show a clear-cut localization in the viral genomes. six features were used to classify the viruses, i.e. the six mid-P values. the values were multiplied by 1 or -1 depending on whether the median PQS count was over- or under-represented. 34 viruses with no PQS count in all three G-island types were excluded from the analysis. unclassified True class dsDNA 33 0 0 1 4 1 0 ssDNA 2 0 0 5 0 1 0 dsRNA 0 0 13 0 5 0 0 ssRNA (+) 4 0 0 45 13 0 0 ssRNA (RT) 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 The number of viruses classified into the six Baltimore groups is shown. dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA(+), ssRNA(-), ssRNA(-), ssRNA(RT) and dsDNA(RT) different replication strategies and structural similarities allow to further divide viruses in families. nts of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to 1,682 nts of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) were reported independently of the genome length by normalizing their number per 1,000 nts. the negative strand of retroviruses (ssRNA (RT) viruses and both strands of dsDNA viruses showed the largest presence of PQSs made of GG-, GGG- and GGGG-islands (box plot the value measures the degree of conservation of G-islands that are necessary and sufficient to form a PQS. the higher the score, the higher the conservation of the PQS. the higher the score, the higher the conservation of the PQS. in Fig 3, three PQSs formed by highly conserved GG-islands are shown for the S segment of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. this kind of analysis is available for all PQSs of all human virus species at http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php. in the context of PQSs, we compared the results obtained from real viral genomes with those obtained by two different simulation strategies. the first (single nucleotide assembling) assumes that the occurrence of each DNA base in the genome is independent. the second (G-island reshuffling) considers that short sequences of a given length (k-mer) could be over-represented in certain viral genomes. a less conservative version of the P-value, called the mid-P value, was used to account for possible high discreteness of the data. the number of viruses whose median PQS count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in S3 Table) the number of viruses whose median PQS count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2. 68 (4.4%) 32/69 (46.4%) 0 (0%) 28/68 (41.2%) 0 (0%) GGGG (positive strand) 17/19 (89.5%) 0 (0%) 17/17 (100%) 0 (0%) GGGG (negative strand) 23/28 (82.1%) 0 (0%) 23/25 (92.0%) 0 (0%) 23/25 (92.0%) 0 (0%) fluenza virus 2 is poor of PQSs made of GG-island in the positive genome strand but is enriched in both GG- and GGG-type PQSs in the negative strand. the increase in G-islands\u2019 length corresponds to a decrease in the absolute number of viruses containing PQSs, but it also corresponds to a dramatic increase in the fraction of them that is statistically significant. the results obtained independently from the two simulation strategies are concordant. the overall number of viruses whose PQS content is significantly different with respect to simulated data is higher when real viral genomes are compared to those generated by single nucleotide assembling. genomes are enriched in GG- and GGG-type PQSs in both strands of their genomes if compared with the islands reshuffling simulation. genome coordinates were extracted for coding sequences (CDS), repeat regions (RR), 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-untranslated (UTR) and promoter regions. genome annotations were exploited to indirectly extract the coordinates of 5\u2019\u2013and 3\u2019\u2013regulatory regions. sDNA viruses presents PQSs distributed along all the four identified genomic features. this feature is consistent with the reported extent of G4s in HSV-1, which are mainly clustered in the RR of the virus genome. other retroviruses (ssRNA) such as HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 display PQS in the CDS. RNA (+), ssRNA (-) and ssRNA (RT) were based on the information of how significant its median PQS counts are. we excluded from the model fit the hepatitis B virus, the only virus classified as dsDNA (RT) and the two unclassified hepatitis delta and hepatitis E viruses. the agreement is good for the dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA (+) and ssRNA (-) classes. the two unclassified genomes of the hepatitis delta and hepatitis E viruses were classified as ssRNA (+) the classifier is based on a multinomial model and uses the one-sided mid-P values as features in combination with the information on whether the median PQS count is under- or over-represented. our data show that viruses belonging to dsDNA, ssDNA, ssRNA (RT) and, to a less extent, ssRNA (+) and ssRNA (-) display the largest presence of GG-, GGG- and GGGG-type P viral genomes enriched in PQSs also contain a higher number of G-islands than expected from mere nucleotide composition. this was not predictable a priori but up to two-thirds of unequivocal assignments suggest that for some viruses the PQS content works as a distinctive feature. this outcome is incomplete due to lack of information in the databases about virus genomic features and partitioning into regulatory and coding regions. dsRNA and dsDNA viruses are notably poor in PQSs. however, single PQSs are highly conserved in ss-genome viruses. the major exception to this evidence is the Herpesviridae family of dsDNA viruses. single conserved PQSs in viruses that do not display statistically significant PQS enrichment may retain key functional roles. a more general evaluation of PQS conservation at higher taxonomic ranks (e.g. at the family level) could have been more informative. the 'zero' class is the best scenario for the development of specific drugs. it is possible that false positive hits fall in this category as it is unexpected that G-islands are less conserved than their connecting loops. previous studies on G4s in viruses suggest most of the virus classes adopted G4-mediated mechanisms to control their viral cycles. one genome per group of aligned sequences was chosen to serve as reference sequence. the complete list of selected reference sequences is reported in S1 Table. a PQS was reported when at least four consecutive guanine islands (G-islands) were detected. is the total number of sequences available for the virus. it is the difference between G4_SCI and the local conservation of the viral sequence spanning the PQS (LSCG4). simulated viral genomes were generated and compared with real data. a computational approach was adopted where the viral genome was modelled as a multinomial stream based on the assumption that each DNA base is independent. in analogy to Huppert and Balasubramanian, the viral genome was modelled as a multinomial stream based on assumption that each DNA base is independent. we generated 10,000 independent sequences for three different simulated datasets. the simulated sequences were scanned for the presence of PQSs. the mid-P value was calculated using a homemade function. the sequences available as negative strands were converted into their inverse complement, together with the coordinates of their genomic features. the overlap extent between PQSs and genomic features was computed by intersecting the genomic coordinates of each PQS with the genomic features extracted from the virus. complete list of viral species able to infect humans was retrieved from http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/678.html. a permissive identity threshold (60%) was used to account for viral variability. multiple clusters of aligned sequences were obtained for some viruses. each virus and for every detected PQS, it is calculated as the percentage of independent genomes maintaining the corresponding G-islands. NG_islands is the number of sequences possessing the G-islands in a certain genome position. simulated viral genomes were generated and compared with real data. we accounted for the probability of cytosines (p(C), p(C), p(A) and thymine (T) bases. the probabilities p(G) and p(C) vary for each virus and reflect the prevalence of G and C bases present in that virus. the remaining proportion is equally split to give p(A) and p(T) two new feature categories were created, 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-untranslated (UTR) and promoter regions. we calculated boundaries for genes in the positive strand of viral genomes as follows: 5\u2019\u2013regulatory = Sgene Scds; 3\u2019\u2013regulatory = Egene\u2014Ecds. positive count was recorded every time an overlap of at least one nucleotide was detected. the total extension of each feature class was calculated by summing the lengths of individual features. the total count of PQS overlapping a feature class was then divided by the total length of the class. the three G-island types considered in the positive (+) and negative (-) strands of all human virus genomes are grouped in the 7 Baltimore classes. from left to right, each segment represents one of the three G-islands (GG, GGG, GGGG) in the positive (top half) and negative (-) strands. the radius of a segment corresponds to 1 minus the mid-P value. the four features considered are coding sequences (CDS), repeat regions (RR) and regulatory regions at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends. the number of PQSs per 1kb is reported on the x-axis both for the positive (orange) and negative (blue) strands."}
