{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a positive-sense, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of genus Betacoronavirus within subfamily Coronavirinae. more than 1600 laboratory-confirmed cases with high fatality rates have been reported. rapid diagnostic tests are urgently required to manage and control this virus. S protein is a major component of the viral surface that binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), enabling the virus to enter and infect cells (Raj et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). coronaviruses express several mutant forms of S protein in order to escape the immune response and achieve viral persistence. the viral structural protein is generally unstable and insoluble in its monomeric or oligomeric forms, making it difficult to prepare antigen for immunization. refolding of solubilized viral proteins by denaturing agents often results in misfolding and functional loss. a cell-free based viral protein production system was developed using wheat germ extract. pcDNA3-HA-MCS was cloned into the EcoRV site of vector pEU-E01-His-TEV-MCS. the amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of vector pEU-E01-His-TEV-MCS (CellFree Sciences, Yokohama, Japan). the beads were washed three times with washing buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. his-MERS-NP (122\u2013413) was then eluted in washing buffer containing 40 mM imidazole. concentrations of purified IgG were determined by measuring the absorbance at OD280. immunoglobulin characterization was carried out using the IsoStrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) anti-MERS-NP antibodies #20, #29, and #46 were diluted in 50 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 9.6) to a concentration of 10 g/mL. the plate was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. wells were blocked with PBS containing 2% (w/v) skim milk. anti-MERS-NP mAbs #5, #13, and #20 were diluted in 50 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. labeled mAbs were diluted to an OD525 4.4 and impregnated into glass fibers. 113 NP sequences from the GenBank were aligned using the MUSCLE software. a Shannon entropy score was calculated for each position in the protein alignment. phylogenetic trees were generated via the maximum-likelihood method. 2 L of a mixture of forward/reverse primers and probe, 1 L of 300 mM DTT, 2 L of reverse transcriptase, 8 L of RNase-free water, and 5 L of Supermix. droplets formed in a QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) positive droplets containing amplification products discriminated from negative droplets. membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 2% (w/v) skim milk for 30 min. incubated for 1 h with anti-MERS-NP mAbs or anti-His polyclonal antibody. proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate. conjugation of mAb #20 with colloidal gold was performed at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. after blocking and washing, conjugated pads impregnated with labeled antibody solution at an OD525 of 8.0. coding amino acids 122\u2013413 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5\u2032-GAGAGATATCTGTGCATGAGGACGGAG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-GAGAGATATCTCTGTTCACATCG-3\u2032. the amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of vector pEU-E01-His-TEV-MCS. the beads were washed three times with washing buffer containing 40 mM imidazole. Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters were used to concentrate purified His-MERS-NP (122\u2013413) by approximately 10\u201320-fold. oglobulin characterization was carried out using the IsoStrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit. the dimer model of MERS-NP was constructed by homology modeling. protein structures not registered in PDB were estimated by the I-TASSER and QUARK servers. anti-MERS-NP antibodies #20, #29, and #46 were diluted in 50 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was dried and blocked at RT, washed with dei. anti-MERS-NP mAbs #5, #13, and #20 were diluted in 50 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. labeled mAbs were diluted to an OD525 4.4 and impregnated into glass fibers. 113 MERS-NP sequences from the GenBank were aligned using the MUSCLE software. a Shannon entropy score was calculated for each position in the protein alignment. phylogenetic trees were generated via the maximum-likelihood method. droplets formed in a QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 42\u00b0C for 60 min for RT reaction; 95\u00b0C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s and 56\u00b0C for 1 min; and a final 10 min denaturation step at 95\u00b0C. anti-MERS-NP mAbs or anti-His polyclonal antibody (GTX115045; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) incubated for 1 h in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T; 1:1000 dilution) and 0.4% (w/v) skim milk. proteins detected with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate. conjugation of mAb #20 with colloidal gold was performed at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. conjugated pads impregnated with labeled antibody solution at an OD525 of 8.0. we produced N-terminally deleted MERS-NP (122\u2013413) as an antigen. tagged N-terminally truncated MERS-NP (122\u2013413) was produced in a wheat germ cell-free system, then purified using nickel-chelated Sepharose beads. each protein fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB staining. two mAbs (#13 and #46) recognized the middle region corresponding to LKR. the remaining five mAbs (#5, #20, #25, #29, and #45) bound the C-terminal end of the protein. more precise epitope mapping was performed using five additional deletion mutants. HEK293A cells were transfected with plasmid vector encoding HA-tagged MERS-NP. cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with each selected antibody. the results revealed that all of the generated mAbs could be used for immunoprecipitation analysis. we found that immobilization of mAb #46 and colloidal gold conjugation of #20 was the optimal combination for ICT. we selected mAbs #46 and #20 for further investigation. each mAb was labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and subjected to ELISA analysis. no evidence of cross-reactivity with mAbs of other human coronaviruses. mAb #20 could still detect the R395H mutant. Arrow indicates amino-acid mutation in the epitope of mAb (#20) from two MERS-CoV strains. the unrooted phylogeny is generated from amino-acid sequence alignments of nucleocapsid proteins. ELISA and ICT were subjected to either ELISA or ICT analysis. recombinant antigen protein and MERS-CoV were subjected to either ELISA or ICT analysis. + and - indicate positive and negative detection. complementary DNA encoding MERS-NP (122\u2013413) was sub-cloned into pEU-His. the protein was purified from the soluble fraction of the extracts. each protein fraction was visualized by CBB staining. the purified protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice. after 4 weeks, splenocytes were isolated and hybridomas were generated. epitope mapping of anti-MERS-NP mAb was performed. deletion mutants were evaluated by immunoblotting. + and - indicate positive and negative detection, respectively. NT; not tested; negative detections highlighted in gray. the combinations of #46/#5, #20/#13, #29/13, #46/#45, and #46/#20 exhibited higher S/N ratios than other pairs. each mAb was labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and subjected to ELISA analysis. no evidence of cross-reactivity with mAbs of other human coronaviruses. multiple alignment of NPs derived from various human coronaviruses revealed that amino-acid sequences targeted by the selected antibodies were specific to MERS-CoV. mAb #20 detected a specific mutation (R395H) in two strains. mAb #20 could still detect the R395H mutant. mAbs detected a 45 kDa protein band consistent with the molecular mass of the MERS-NP. no other bands were detected by the mAbs, demonstrating their specificity for MERS-NP. so, newly developed antibodies could detect NP antigen derived from MERS-CoV virions. ICT was highly sensitive, with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/0.1 mL. we then examined the detection limit for virions prepared in phosphate buffer containing 1% NP-40. wheat germ extract uses eukaryotic translation system to synthesize mAbs. mAbs can be divided into two groups, conformation-sensitive and -insensitive. mAbs can detect denatured linear antigen or peptide immobilized on membrane. newly developed antibodies were suitable for immunoprecipitation, indicating that they are sensitive to protein conformation. other types of human coronaviruses are related to respiratory diseases. the most widely used current diagnostics for MERS-CoV involve detection of virus nucleic acids by qRT-PCR in the laboratory. qRT-PCR is a sensitive and powerful tool for obtaining evidence of virus infection but requires specialized lab equipment and expertise with molecular technology. ng (ICT) of recombinant N protein and 1.5 105 (ELISA) or 3.0 106 viral copies (ICT) ensuring its feasibility in practical clinical tests. other groups have also developed antigen-capture ELISA and ICT."}
