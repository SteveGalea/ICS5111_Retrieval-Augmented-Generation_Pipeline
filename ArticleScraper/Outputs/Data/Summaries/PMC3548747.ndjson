{"summary": "degenerate primers allow for the PCR amplification of a wider range of viral isolates with only one set of pre-mixed primers. results We have developed a fully automated degenerate PCR primer design system that plays a key role in the viral sequencing pipeline. 8 out of 15 viruses have had PCR primers designed for: measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus. a few primers from the entire computationally designed set were not completely true to the algorithm\u2019s recommendations. HYDEN tries to maximize the coverage of a degenerate primer pair with a minimal amount of degeneracy. the goal of JCVI\u2019s degenerate primer design pipeline is to maximize the success rate of selected primer pairs, given a set of sequences assumed to represent the target population. degenerate primer design pipeline was used to design primers for multiple viral projects across 15 different DNA and RNA viruses including both segmented and non-segmented viruses. results for 8 different non-segmented viruses are presented here. the median amplicon coverage for all viruses is approximately 3x, but in many cases the ends of the genomes had a lower minimum coverage, i.e.,1x or 2x, due to the inability to select primer beyond the end of the available sequence. the number of sequences collected to construct each consensus sequence ranged from 3 (for HRSV-A and HRSV-B) to 32 (for MuV) for each viral type, a single consensus file was generated with a target of less than 10% degenerate bases. measles virus (MeV) and rubella virus (RUBV-G2) had percent ambiguities exceeding 10%. two sets of sequences were used as input to generate consensus sequences for genotype 1 (G1) and genotype 2 (G2) based on 11 and 5 sequences. this reduced the percent degeneracy across the consensus sequence to 6.07% and 13.13%, for G1 and G2 respectively. the percent dissimilarity between the two clades was approximately 20%. separate primers pairs were then designed for the two clades independently. amplicons were designed with an intended coverage depth of 2x or 3x. the success rates provided in Table 1 represent the average success rates for each virus type as a percentage of all sequencing reactions performed. however, since the effect of isolate is confounded inside of the average success rate, a graded approach was taken. if a primer pair was successful at a low percentage across all samples, then it was possible that the primers did not match the genotype of the isolate. rate Total average success rate Virus Type >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >90% HPIV-1 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.98 0.98 0. each green rectangle represents an amplicon. each green rectangle represents an amplicon. the long black bar represents the targeted region. the red X\u2019s above the targeted region represent locations where 2x coverage could not be achieved. 7%, 73% and 70% for overall forward, reverse and total sequencing success rate respectively. lack of correlation could be a result of the few sequences represented by the degenerate consensus sequence poorly representing the isolates very accurately. results for 8 different non-segmented viruses are presented here. 61 9.28 37.97 32 96 3x PRJNA73019 RUBV-G1 80.05 78.63 79.34 3556 4882 6.07 66.75 11 96 2x PRJNA70479 RUBV-G2 71.52 69.24 70.38 1478 2100 13.13 61.37 5 96 2x PRJNA70479 HRSV-A 91.32 89.96 90.64 3004 3332 6. the number of sequences collected to construct each consensus sequence ranged from 3 (for HRSV-A and HRSV-B) to 32 (for MuV) for each viral type, a single consensus file was generated with a target of less than 10% degenerate bases. for each viral type, a single consensus file was generated with a target of less than 10% degenerate bases. degenerate primers were computed independently for the G1 and G2 consensus sequences. the rubella sequences were divided into two groups, RUBV-G1 (green) and RUBV-G2 (blue), to reduce the percent ambiguity across their consensus sequences. dissimilarity between the two clades was approximately 20%. initial sequences were split into two clades of human metapneumovirus. amplicons were designed with an intended coverage depth of 2x or 3x. the success rates provided in Table 1 represent the average success rates for each virus type as a percentage of all sequencing reactions performed. however, since the effect of isolate is confounded inside of the average success rate, a graded approach was taken to gain a deeper understanding of the success rate of primer pairs across isolates. for each primer pair and isolate, sequencing was performed in both the forward and reverse directions. >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% >25% >50% >75% >85% >90% HPIV-1 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.

locations where 2x coverage could not be achieved. a lack of correlation could be a result of the few sequences represented by the degenerate consensus sequence poorly representing the isolates very accurately. the modular architecture of the primer design software has made it possible to readily integrate new features into the pipeline. output is a set of degenerate primer pairs and their theoretical amplicons based on the consensus reference sequence. a variety of supplemental design information is also generated. an Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file contains a visualization of the tiling layout of the amplicons across the targeted genome. dreg uses regular expressions, a highly flexible pattern recognition specification. binding of the 11 base pairs of the 3\u2019 end were sufficient for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the copy strand. degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the PCR reaction. the number of alternative products may exhibit a quadratic relationship with the number of unique primer sequences involved in the PCR. the end effect is to limit the number of degenerate bases per primer to no more than 4 but preferably less than 3 bases. the degenerate base W is required if both the alleles A and T exist in the population for a specific position. but applying a 4% percentage filter would change the W to the non-degenerate base, T, if the analyst believes this polymorphism was actually due to sequencing error. a statistical filter, combining both frequency and percentage, may be applied. the number of degenerate bases that must be introduced into the consensus sequence becomes too high. a general landscape of variation can be ascertained with a plot of normalized entropy versus location. regions with localized high rates of variation do not generally introduce difficulty in primer pair selection due to the primer designer\u2019s dynamic tiling capabilities. reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using Qiagen One Step RT-PCR kit. each viral sample underwent RT-PCR reactions with 96 pairs of designed primers in a 96-well format. unincorporated dNTPs were dephosphorylated and excess primers were removed from products using a SAP/Exo I reaction containing 0.5 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corporation) the cycling program was: 1 cycle of 37\u00b0C (60 min) and 1 cycle of 72\u00b0C (15 min) consensus sequence with ambiguity codes may be established by generating multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with a tool such as Clustalw [6] or Muscle [7] and then using a MSA-to-consensus generator such as cons from EMBOSS [8], or one of the applications from ANDES [9]. output is a set of degenerate primer pairs and their theoretical amplicons based on the consensus reference sequence. a variety of supplemental design information is primer3 has generated a list of primer pair candidates with embedded N\u2019s. the CM remaps the degenerate primer pair candidates back to their original ambiguity code and passes the degenerate primer pair candidates to the PC component for additional critiquing. dreg uses regular expressions, a highly flexible pattern recognition specification, for sequence matching. degenerate primer design pipeline is a consensus reference sequence of the targeted genome. this consensus sequence is used as a reference for detecting alternative products. the entire genome sequence is still required as a reference for detecting potential alternative amplification products. the CM component uses primer3 [10] to generate a list of candidate primer pairs. primer3 will return an error message if ambiguity codes are found on the user-specified template. the CM remaps the N\u2019s back to their original ambiguity code. degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the PCR reaction. degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the PCR reaction, thus increasing the likelihood of successfully targeting an unknown sample from a heterogeneous population. andance filtering can be performed using several techniques to reduce the number of degenerate bases introduced into the consensus sequence. the analyst assumes not all point mutations represented in the set of sequences acquired from the population are equally important. a nominal filter or percentage filter can be applied to remove the presence of alleles that are not represented at or above a user-specified frequency or percentage threshold. the more a difference between clusters can be used to separate the clusters, the less variation will exist within each of the formed clusters. the maximum intra-cluster percent dissimilarity cutoff that works well is approximately 10%. tiling overlap of 100/100 bp, optimal/minimum/maximum primer lengths of 20/18/25 bp, low complexity filter of 80%, primer binding site hairpin detection at >14 stem hydrogen bonds. maximum internal primer dimer of 8 bp and maximum end primer dimer of 3 bp. NaseOut (Invitrogen), 2.2l undiluted RNA, and 3l primers (1.6M, forward and reverse mixed) was added to each RUBV-G1 and RUBV-G2 reactions due to the high GC content of the genome. for the other genomes, an additional 1.6l of water was added to each reaction. all sequencing data was released to Genbank with annotation.
