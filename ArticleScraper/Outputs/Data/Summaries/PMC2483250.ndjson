{"summary": "influenza pandemic from 1918 to 1919 was the most devastating infectious disease pandemic ever documented in such a short period of time. young adults aged 18\u201335 yrs old had the highest mortality rate, so much so that the average life expectancy during those years was lowered by 10 years. human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains of subtype H5N1 have also been particularly severe for children and young adults. matched H5N1 and H1N1 virus pairs represent high and low virulence infections of each influenza subtype. they represent high and low virulence infections of each influenza subtype as previously determined in the mouse model [18],[21]. 1918 (H1N1) and A/Thailand/16/2004 (Thai/16, H5N1) viruses replicated to high titers that were at least 5-fold higher than the respective LP viruses. the HP Thai/16 virus reached peak titers later than the 1918 virus at day 5 pi. the less mouse-virulent SP/83 virus reached its highest titers on day 7 p.i. female mice were infected intranasally with 102 PFU of influenza viruses. lungs were harvested for virus titration at various times post-inoculation. p0.05 between 1918 and Thai/16 infected lungs and TX/91 and SP/83 infected lungs. on day 7 p.i., there were as many as 1.3108 cells in HP-infected lungs compared with 4.0\u20138.0107 cells in LP-infected and 1.8107 cells in PBS-inoculated lungs. mice were infected with 102 PFU of influenza viruses, lungs removed and cell suspensions prepared at various times post-inoculation. mice infected with each of the viruses showed an increase in the number of macrophages beginning 3 days p.i. and continuing through day 9 p.i.. as early as 2 days p.i, there was 1\u20132 million more macrophages in the lungs of HP-infected lungs than in LP virus-infected lungs. between days 3 and 7 p.i., lungs infected with HP viruses showed a three fold increase in neutrophil numbers. at peak of neutrophil infiltration on day 7 p.i, there was 4\u20138 million more neutrophils in lungs of HP-infected animals compared to LP-infected mice. neutrophil populations were elevated in all infection groups compared to mock levels beginning 1 day p.i. but percentages of neutrophils in HP virus-infected mice were significantly higher. levels remained elevated at each subsequent time point measured. 6.1 (0.6) 5.5 (0.7) 5.7 (0.5) 5.6 (0.6) NA Neutrophils (CD11b+, CD11c, Ly6G/C+, CD4, CD8) SP/83 7.7 (0.5) 7.5 (2.5) 6.3 (1.5) 7.8 (4.5) 8.4 (5.9) 8.7 (0.8) Thai/16 9.7 (1.1) 8.9 (0.8) 9.3 (3.0) 9.1 (1.3) 15.2 (1.6) 18.8 (0.0) PBS 4.5 2.6 6.8 4.8 TX/91 2.1 1.1 2.9 4.3 2.5 1.0 0.8 CD8+ T cells (CD4, CD8+, CD11b, CD11c, Ly6G/C) SP/83 2.3 1.4 2.3 2.2 1.8 5.9 1.5 Thai/16 2.2 2.8 2.7 3.0 1.7 1.3 1.6 PBS 2.0 BALB/c mice were infected intra-nasally with 102 PFU influenza viruses. the 1918 pandemic virus and a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus elicit significantly high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. we analyzed 17 chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of mice on days 1 and 4 p.i and report data here on 6 of the analytes that revealed significant differences among the viruses tested. day 4 p.i. is a time when significant differences were observed in lung virus titers between HP and the HP viruses were also potent inducers of IL-1 and IFN. IL-6, (a generally pro-inflammatory cytokine) was also elevated in 1918 and H5N1 virus-infected lungs with SP/83 levels similar to 1918 infected lungs. mouse lung macrophages were harvested from naive BALB/c mice. they were infected in vitro (MOI = 0.1, Figure 4A) as described. at 13 hrs p.i. there was 18 fold higher 1918 and Thai/16 virus released from infected cells than TX/91 and SP/83 viruses. mouse lung macrophages support low levels of 1918 and Thai/16 virus production early following infection. primary macrophages were harvested from the lungs of healthy BALB/c mice. mouse lung macrophages were grown in 12 well plates and infected with viruses in duplicate. kine responses as to TX/91 inoculated cells were 2.5 logs greater than TX/91 infected macrophages. cytokine response from infected human macrophages elicited at least a 2 fold greater cytokine response than the SP/83 virus infected cultures in every cytokine measured. differences in virus titers was also observed between Thai/16 inoculated cultures and the 1918, TX/91, and SP/83 infection groups at 24, 48 and 72 hrs p.i. 1918 and Thai/16 virus infected cells released more infectious virus over time than the LP SP/83 virus infected cultures. mouse lung macrophages and dendritic cells are susceptible to highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in the lung tissue. the HP Thai/16 virus reached peak titers later than the 1918 virus at day 5 pi. the less mouse-virulent SP/83 virus reached it's highest titers on day 7 p.i. female BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 102 PFU of influenza viruses. lungs were harvested for virus titration at various times post-inoculation. increased cellularity in lungs of mice infected with highly pathogenic H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses. as many as 1.3108 cells in HP-infected lungs compared with 4.0\u20138.0107 cells in LP-infected and 1.8107 cells in PBS-inoculated lungs. the data shows the total number of viable lung cells from three mice per time point, (per virus group) mice infected with each of the viruses showed an increase in the numbers of macrophages beginning 3 days p.i. and continuing through day 9 p.i. as early as 2 days p.i, there was 1\u20132 million more macrophages in the lungs of HP-infected lungs than in LP virus-infected lungs. between days 3 and 7 p.i., lungs infected with HP viruses showed a three fold increase in neutrophil numbers. at peak of neutrophil infiltration on day 7 p.i, there was 4\u20138 million more neutrophils in the lungs of HP-infected animals compared to LP-infected mice. /91 and SP/83 virus-infected mice from days 2 though 9 p.i. (p0.005) were elevated in all infection groups compared to mock levels beginning 1 day p.i. but percentages of neutrophils in HP virus-infected mice were significantly higher (* p0.05) than those in LP virus-infected mice beginning day 2 p.i. 8.8 (4.5) 8.4 (5.9) 8.7 (0.8) Thai/16 9.7 (1.1) 8.9 (0.8) 9.3 (9.0) 9.1 (1.3) 15.2 (1.6) 18.8 (0.0) PBS 5.3 (0.8) 1918 3.0 (0.3) 2.5 (0.3) 3.0 (0.4)* 2.3 (0.3)* 2.2 (0.1)* 1.9 (0.2)* TX/91 3.5 (1.2) 3.4 (0.5) 4.7 (0.4) 5.7 (1.0) the 1918 pandemic virus and a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus elicit significantly high levels of pro-inflammatory. the 1918 pandemic virus and a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus elicit significantly high levels of pro-inflammatory pro-inflammatory. 17 chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of mice on days 1 and 4 p.i. we analyzed 17 chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of mice. day 4 p.i. is a time when significant differences were observed in lung virus titers between HP and LP. IL-6, a generally pro-inflammatory cytokine, was also elevated in 1918 and H5N1 virus-infected lungs compared to TX/91 levels. significant differences were measured between 1918 and TX/91 virus infected lungs on day 4 p.i. for each cytokine and chemokine. mouse lung macrophages were harvested from naive BALB/c mice. infected in vitro (MOI = 0.1, Figure 4A) as described. at 13 hrs p.i. there was 18 fold higher 1918 and Thai/16 virus released from infected cells than TX/91 and SP/83 virus-inoculated cultures. mouse lung macrophages support low levels of 1918 and Thai/16 virus production early following infection. primary macrophages were harvested from the lungs of healthy BALB/c mice through tissue digestion (A) and developed from human peripheral blood monocytes (B) and infected in vitro with influenza viruses. Thai/16 infected cultures elicited at least a 2 fold greater cytokine response than the SP/83 virus infected cultures in every cytokine measured except IL-8 and MCP-1 chemokines. supernatants were sampled 48 hours post-infection and cytokines measured by bioplex protein Array assay. significant differences in virus titers was observed between Thai/16 inoculated cultures and the 1918, TX/91, and SP/83 infection groups. primary dendritic cells were isolated from the lungs of healthy mice and developed from human monocytes. in CD11b+ (macrophages) cell cultures, the 1918 and Thai/16 virus infected cells released more infectious virus over time than the LP SP/83 virus infected cultures. these data further demonstrate that mouse lung macrophages and dendritic cells are susceptible to highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in the lung tissue. significant increase in cellularity in comparison to LP seasonal H1N1 isolate. differences in titer between HP and LP virus-infected mice were observed as early as day 1 post-inoculation (p.i.) differences in virus titers between paired subtype viruses were minimal. apoptosis in the spleen and lungs of HP H5N1-infected mice detected in situ suggests a mechanism for cell loss [16]. chemokines MCP-1 and MIP1- were observed among H5N1 and 1918 virus infected mice. higher levels of IL-6 were measured in 1918 and Thai/16 virus infected lungs. this is confirming evidence of a heightened lung cytokine response to 1918 and H5N1 infection in mice. cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines correlate with disease outcome. the 1918 virus exhibited higher baseline titers in human and mouse macrophages as early as 2 hrs p.i. compared to the TX/91 H1N1 virus or the H5N1 viruses. the role of other cell surface molecules on innate immune cells such as the mannose receptor in HP influenza infection should be investigated. influenza viruses used in these experiments included the reconstructed A/South Carolina/1/18 virus (H1N1) [21], A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1), A/Thailand/16/2004 (H5N1), and A/Thailand/SP/83/2004 (H5N1) these viruses were chosen as pairs within subtypes due to their respective fifty percent lethal dose (LD50) titers. monocytes were cultured in RPMI (Gibco) with 20% heat inactivated autologous serum for 7 days in the presence of GM-CSF (1000 U) before infection. for development of dendritic cells, monocytes were grown in RPMI (Gibco) with 20% heat inactivated autologous serum for 10 days in the presence of IL-4 (1000U) primary mouse lung macrophages typically displayed typical morphology with dendritic extensions. primary mouse lung dendritic cells typically displayed typical morphology with dendritic extensions. in vitro infections Primary human and mouse cells were washed 3 with serum free growth media and infected for 1 hour with viruses. 8\u201310 week old female BALB/c mice were anesthetized with Avertin [20] (Sigma-Aldrich) and infected intranasally (i.n.) with 50 l of 102 PFU of influenza viruses prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) mice were euthanatized and exsanguinated. cell suspensions were incubated with anti-Fc block (anti-mouse CD16/CD32) to reduce non-specific antibody binding for 10 min. cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2% paraformaldehyde. titrations and cytokine analysis At various times post-infection (n = 3 mice per virus group) lungs were removed and stored at 70\u00b0C until virus and cytokine levels could be quantified. cytokine levels were measured by fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies in duplicate against a standard curve. influenza viruses used in these experiments included the reconstructed A/South Carolina/1/18 virus (H1N1) [21], A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1), A/Thailand/16/2004 (H5N1), and A/Thailand/SP/83/2004 (H5N1) these viruses were chosen as pairs within subtypes due to their respective fifty percent lethal dose (LD50) titers in mice and ferrets. monocytes were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 6 well plates in macrophage SFM media (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) with 20% heat inactivated autologous serum for 7 days in the presence of GM-CSF (1000 U) before infection. primary mouse lung macrophages and dendritic cells (CD11b+) were extracted from contaminating cells by selection on magnetic columns. in vitro infections Primary human and mouse cells were washed 3 with serum free growth media and infected for 1 hour with viruses. cells were washed 3 with serum free growth media and 1 ml SFM media, containing 1 g/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) was placed into the wells. 102 PFU of influenza viruses prepared in phosphate buffered saline. avertin was chosen as the anesthetic because it provides consistent mouse infections with the viruses used in these studies. mice were euthanatized and exsanguinated during a prolonged disease course. c cells were isolated by positive selection on CD11b+ or CD11c+ MACS columns. columns containing bound immune cells were washed extensively (5x) and CD11b+ or CD11c+ cells were eluted off the magnetic columns and cultured in 6-well plates in 5 ml of RPMI containing 5% BSA. n = 3 mice per virus group were homogenized individually in 1 ml PBS. cytokine levels were measured by fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies in duplicate against a standard curve. p0.05 was considered
