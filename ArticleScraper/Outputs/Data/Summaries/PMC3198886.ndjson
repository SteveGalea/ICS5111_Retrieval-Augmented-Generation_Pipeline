{"summary": "the city is both a center for disease and poor health and also a place of hope, cures and good health. the health care industry has always been part of the economic base of cities, from Lourdes, in France, to Rochester, Minnesota, to megacities. megacity regions around the world include centers of excellence in health and social care. new york, Greater London, Tokyo and Paris have grappled with the challenges of protecting population health. shenzhen had a total population of 14.5 million, 12 million as floating population and 2.5 million permanent residents. PRD accounts for 10% of china's GDP, nearly 30% of the cumulative stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) the plan calls for continued growth (3,000 km) of highway construction between 2008 and 2020. between 2012 and 2020, it projects massive growth of rail construction for high-speed trains. between 2012 and 2020, it projects massive growth of rail construction for high-speed trains. as shenzhen and dongguan, the ratio of migrants officially registered with these cities to those born there is, respectively, six and four to one. the most immediate public health challenge in PRD arises from working conditions of migrant laborers who take on all the jobs local citizens refuse. many companies employ migrants in the most dangerous jobs, expose them to dangerous substances, and skimp on safety measures. health care inequalities are significantly greater in Guangdong province than in the nation as whole. the ratio of per capita health care expenditure of the highest income to the lowest income groups was one to six in the province. in 2009, less than 10% of migrants have basic social security coverage and 80% have no health insurance. the capacity of local officials to perform the core functions of public health will depend, in part, on the size and quality of their workforce. the capacity of local officials to perform these functions will depend, in part, on the size and quality of their workforce. the development and management of such public health infrastructure involves important links between local, regional, national as well as private non-profit organizations. new york city stands out, in contrast to London, Paris and Tokyo, because it has the largest share of its population not covered under a national system that eliminates financial barriers to health care access. u.s.-based PRD is no more immune than other coastal cities to climate change and its effects on sea levels, temperature rises and their potential catastrophic effects on human populations, particularly older people. u.s.-based PRD is the largest gateway city-region in the world with respect to numbers of foreigners entering the nation. the unique characteristics of PRD, however, suggest that prevailing models will not suffice. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors read and approved the final manuscript. prepub Acknowledgements We wish to thank Wang Ju and Monique Abud from the Centre Chine, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, for their research assistance."}
