{"summary": "Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) but is not associated with any human disease. in 2008, REBOV infections were identified in swine for the first time in the Philippines. Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) is sporadic in the Philippines. it has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus macaques. it is unclear how REBOV was spread among swine during the epizootic. the results showed a high prevalence of REBOV infection in swine in the affected farms at the epizootics in 2008. however, REBOV antibodies were not detected in the swine population not associated with the epizootics. in the IFA, none of the 49 swine sera collected in Japan showed a positive reaction. each 54 (78.3%) of the 69 swine sera showed positive reactions in the NP- and GP-specific IFA. 158 (73.5%) and 169 (78.6%) of the 215 swine sera collected at the affected farms were REBOV-NP and -GP antibody positive in the IFA. the infectious titer of the VSV-pseudotype reached 3.6 x 106 IU/mL. infection with the VSV-pseudotype was neutralized with rabbit serum to REBOV-GP. in the NT, none of the 49 swine sera collected in Japan neutralized the infection with the VSV-pseudotype on Vero E6 cells at serum dilutions of 1 in 100. these OD values to the NP and GP of each serum sample at a dilution of 1 in 100 were plotted. ROC and TG-ROC curves were also drawn. sensitivity and specificity of the assay are over 95% in both IgG-ELISAs. OD values to the NP (A) and GP (B) of each serum sample at a dilution of 1 in 100 were plotted for swine group showing either IF and NT antibody positive or negative. swine sera showed characteristic granular staining patterns in the cytoplasm. antibody positive swine sera showed characteristic cellular surface staining patterns. in Bulacan, 104 (71.2%) and 115 (78.8%) of the 146 swine sera showed positive reactions in the NP- and GP-specific IFA. in total, 54 (78.3%) of the 69 swine sera showed positive reactions in the NP- and GP-specific IFA. 119/146 (81.5%) 115/146 (78.8%) 108/146 (74.0%) Pangasinan 62/69 (89.9%) 54/69 (78.3%) 46/69 (66.7%) 54/69 (78.3%) 46/69 (66.7%) Tarlac 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0%) 0/98 (0 NT titers ranged between 100 and 12,800 with average of 790 and median of 400. none of the 98 swine sera showed any positive reaction (Table 1). Detection of REBOV-NP and -GP specific antibodies in swine using IgG-ELISA. reaction in the GP specific IgG-ELISA and 1 of the 49 swine sera collected in Japan showed a positive reaction in the NP- and GP-specific IgG-ELISA (Table 1). however, these results are considered false positives because the OD values were close to the cut off level defined by the assay. all the samples collected in Tarlac and Japan tested using the alternative serological assays were negative. we have tested 215 swine sera collected from the REBOV affected farms using IFA and IgG-ELISA specific for REBOV-NP and -GP, and NT. this avoided the use of infectious REBOV, enabling the work to be carried out at low containment. we could not analyze the IgM responses in swine. the swine not associated with the epizootics, in Tarlac, are considered to be free from REBOV infection. this is not clear if the swine population in the Philippines is generally free from REBOV infection in 2008. the multiple serological assays used in the study are thought to be useful for future surveillance of REOBV infection in swine in the Philippines. 146 sera were collected from swine at the farm in Bulacan and 69 from those in Pangasinan. the entire cDNA of REBOV-GP ORF was amplified using the primers REBOV-GP/F (5\u2019-CGA AGC TTC GAA CAT GGG GTC AGG ATA TCA ACT-3\u2019) the complete nucleotide sequence of the amplicon was determined to be identical to that of Reston 08A. the pKS336 plasmid with REBOV-GP, pKS336-pREBOV-GP, the cells expressing REBOV-GP were spotted on multiwell slide glasses. they were used as negative control antigens in the IFA. the slides were incubated with serially diluted swine sera. the infectious titer of VSV-pseudotype on vero E6 cells was determined by counting number of GFP-positive cells. NT titers of the tested sera were defined as reciprocals of the highest dilutions at which more than 50% inhibition of infectivity was observed. a recombinant baculovirus, Ac-His-pREBOV-NP, was generated using a previously described method. the recombinant baculovirus expresses the ectodomain of REBOV-glycoprotein (GP) with a histidine-tag at its carboxyl terminus. the expression and purification of REBOV-NP and REBOV-GP were confirmed in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining Tn5 cells infected with Ac-P were processed similarly. the purified antigens and negative control antigen were kept at -80\u00b0C until use. the plates were washed three times, and 100 L of ABTS solution was added to each well. the adjusted ODs for each tested sample were calculated by subtracting the ODs of the negative-control-antigen\u2013coated wells from those of the corresponding REBOV-antigen\u2013coated wells. ninety-eight swine sera were collected from swine aged between 2 and 20 months. the sera were kept frozen at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in the Philippines until use. the complete nucleotide sequence of the amplicon was determined to be identical to that of Reston 08A. the amplicon was cloned into pKS336 [28], and the pKS336 plasmid with REBOV-GP, pKS336-pREBOV-GP, was used for transfection. the selected cells were analyzed for the expression of REBOV-GP in IFA using anti-REBOV-GP rabbit serum the slides were washed in PBS, then reacted with rabbit anti-pig IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocianate (FITC) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. the antibody titer in the IFA was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing positive staining. NT titers of the tested sera were defined as the reciprocals of the highest dilutions at which more than 50% inhibition of infectivity was observed. serum samples were considered to be NT antibody negative when less than 50% inhibition of infectivity was observed at a dilution of 1 in 100. a recombinant baculovirus, Ac-His-pREBOV-NP, was generated using a previously described method. the recombinant baculovirus (Ac-P) expresses the ectodomain of REBOV-glycoprotein (GP) with a histidine-tag at its carboxyl terminus [22] was used to prepare recombinant REBOV-GP for IgG-ELISA IgG-ELISA Swine sera were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to REBOV-NP and REBOV-GP. half of the wells of the ELISA plates were coated with a predetermined optimal quantity (approximately 100 ng/well) each well was inoculated with 200 L of T-PBS containing 5% skim milk (MT-PBS; Yukijirushi, Hokkaido, MO, USA) the adjusted ODs for each tested sample were calculated by subtracting the ODs of the negative-control-antigen\u2013coated wells from those of the corresponding REBOV-antigen\u2013coated wells. sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were defined as the probability that the target assay result was positive when the IFAs specific to REBOV-NP and -GP and NT showed positive.
