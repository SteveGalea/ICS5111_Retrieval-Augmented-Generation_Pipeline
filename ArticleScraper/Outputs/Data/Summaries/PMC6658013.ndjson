{"summary": "RSV is an enveloped virus of the Pneumoviridae family. it has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. the fusion glycoprotein is well conserved with sequence identities >90%. many vaccine trials for RSV are currently underway [16], many of which contain the RSV F glycoprotein as an antigen. it has been shown that F is a major target of neutralizing antibodies [17, 18] and is the only protein on the viral surface that is strictly required for entry [19, 20]. the mechanism and underlying cause of RSV F triggering is not well understood. the majority of RSV-neutralizing activity in human sera is due to antibodies specific for the prefusion conformation of F [17, 18], and recent characterization of the human antibody response to RSV F has revealed that prefusion-specific antigenic sites, including site (\u201czero\u201d), are the major target of neutralizing antibodies [18, 32, 33]. structure of 5C4 bound to RSV F was determined, revealing a nearly identical conformation of prefusion RSV F as that observed in the D25-bound structure. however, crystal structures of the different prefusion-stabilized variants of RSV F have revealed an alternative conformation of antigenic site or weak electron density in this region. it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F that may be important for triggering membrane fusion. a germline-reverted version of RSD5 (RSD5-GL) showed similar neutralization potency and binding kinetics for prefusion RSV F. AM22, D25, and RSD5 displayed distinct affinities and binding kinetics when compared to each other. fusion RSV F from (A) subtype A (strain A2) or (B) subtype B (strain B9320) is plotted as a black line. each binding curve has a 180 second association phase, followed by a 500 second dissociation phase. the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) is displayed immediately above the SPR curve for each Fab. 1.000 1.000 0.979 Cell dimensions a, b, c, 64.2, 75.2, 109.0 132.4, 152.2, 202.9 270.3, 270.3, 270.3, 270.3 = = (\u00b0) 90 90 90 Resolution () 32.7\u20131.7 (1.73\u20131.70)* 50.5\u20133.5 (3.61\u20133.50) 38.2\u20133.5 (3.64\u20133.50) Rmerge 0.069 (0.739) 0.313 (0.903) 0.094 crystal structure of the F\u2013AM22 complex shows three AM22 Fabs bind to prefusion RSV F at the membrane-distal apex of the trimer. one RSV F protomer and one AM22 Fab are shown in ribbon representation. the other two Fabs are shown as molecular surfaces. the amino acid sequence of RSV F site is shown for both strains A2 and B9320. the AM22 heavy chain buries 554 2 (76%) on the surface of prefusion RSV F and is involved in 15 hydrogen bonds with RSV F. the light chain is responsible for the remaining 175 2 (24%) of buried surface area on prefusion RSV F and forms three additional hydrogen bonds with the 4\u20135 loop. incorporating the K209Q substitution in subtype A prefusion RSV F results in a decreased affinity of AM22 with a KD of 6.7 nM. the crystal structure of prefusion RSV F in complex with the RSD5-GL Fab to 3.5 resolution. three RSD5-GL Fabs bound to prefusion RSV F are shown in ribbon representation. one RSV F protomer and the contacted RSD5-GL Fab are shown as molecular surfaces. the other two Fabs are shown as molecular surfaces. the CDR H2 contacts 3 and forms a salt bridge with Lys168. the light chain contributes to the interface through contacts with 4, including hydrogen bonds with Asp200 and main-chain atoms. AM22 and D25 adopt a vertical angle of approach and bind slightly lower on prefusion RSV F, bridging antigenic sites and V. the epitope of each antibody is shown on the green protomer. the epitope is colored purple for AM22, red for RSD5-GL, and blue for D25. the amino acid sequence of residues near RSV F site is shown for both strain A2 and strain B9320. prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants DS-Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMU) and PR-DM (PDB ID: 5C69 [41] have a more closed conformation of site, where 4 does not kink out and there is a smaller angle between 4 and 5. the structure of DS-Cav1 bound to RSD5-GL reveals an intermediate site conformation, with the 4-helix only slightly kinked out and away from 5, but AM22 and RSD5-GL bind with high affinity to prefusion RSV F. differences in antibody kinetics and subtype specificities have not been fully explored. RSD5-GL Fab has substantial subtype specificity with a >2,000-fold stronger affinity for subtype B compared to subtype A. preferential binding of RSD5-GL for subtype B is primarily due to the off-rate, which is fast for subtype A and slow for the subtype B interaction. crystals of the AM22 Fab alone diffracted X-rays to 1.7 and crystals of the prefusion RSV F\u2013AM22 complex diffracted X-rays to 3.5 (Table 1). the AM22 variable domain (Fv) superimposes very well between bound and unbound crystal structures, with high structural similarity across the framework and complementarity-determining regions. unique reflections 58,782 (3,082) 52,333 (4,425) 41,327 (4,656) Refinement Resolution () 32.7\u20131.7 (1.74\u20131.70) 47.2\u20133.5 (3.56\u20133.50) 38.2\u20133.5 (3.59\u20133.50) the AM22 heavy chain buries 554 2 (76%) on the surface of prefusion RSV F and is involved in 15 hydrogen bonds with RSV F. the light chain is responsible for the remaining 175 2 (24%) of buried surface area on prefusion RSV F. a 3-strand anti-parallel -sheet is formed between the CDR H3 of AM22 and 4\u20135 loop of F1. when bound by AM22, the 4-helix shifts away from 5, stretching the 4\u20135 loop and allowing it to adopt a -strand conformation that pairs with the -hairpin formed by the CDR H3 of AM22. Upon RSV F triggering and the rearrangement into the continuous 5-helix, 4 and the 4\u20135 loop crystal structure of prefusion RSV F in complex with the RSD5-GL Fab to 3.5 resolution. three RSD5-GL Fabs bind to the membrane-distal apex of the prefusion RSV F trimer. interactions of RSD5-GL with prefusion RSV F are more diverse than that of AM22. the RSD5-GL heavy chain buries 577 2 (67%) on the surface of prefusion RSV F. the CDR H3 interacts with 4 and the F2 loop, forming hydrogen bonds with Asp200 and main-chain atoms of Lys65. the CDR H2 contacts 3 and forms a salt bridge with Lys168. the epitopes of all three antibodies overlap significantly. the epitopes of all three antibodies make multiple competing contacts with 4 and the 4\u20135 loop. AM22, RSD5-GL, and D25 Fab have overlapping epitopes at the apex of the RSV F trimer. the interface between AM22 and F2 accounts for only 9% of the buried surface area on prefusion RSV F. AM22 forms no hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with F2. the structure of DS-Cav1 in complex with AM22 shows a more open conformation of this site, with the 4-helix kinked out and away from 5, resulting in a stretched 4\u20135 loop. analysis of published crystal structures of prefusion RSV F in complex with neutralizing antibodies targeting various antigenic sites further supports an ensemble of site conformations. each panel (A\u2013C) also contains faded versions of the two other conformations for direct comparison. antibody epitopes overlap substantially and would prevent any two from binding simultaneously due to large steric clashes. varying antibody kinetics can mislead epitope classification when using only competition assays. conformational flexibility is further supported by crystal structures of multiple prefusion-stabilized variants. peptide was anchored by a disulfide bond in the DS structure (PDB ID: 4MMQ), site was conformationally heterogeneous as indicated by the lack of electron density. however, site cavity-filling mutations introduced in the Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMS) variants stabilized the prefusion RSV F structure and showed clear electron density extending from the fusion peptide through site. the only discrepancy between the crystal structures of wild-type phi-psi angles of proline residues and disruption of the alpha-helix hydrogen bond network inhibit hinge motion required of the helix-loop-helix motif. however, for wild-type prefusion RSV F there is a conserved proline residue (Pro205) within the middle of the 4-helix, N-terminal to the 4\u20135 loop that may act as a hinge during refolding. the ideal prefusion RSV F immunogen would maintain this conformational flexibility of site as well as present neutralizing epitopes common to both RSV subtypes. we propose that the ideal prefusion RSV F immunogen would maintain this natural conformational flexibility of site. DS-Cav1 from strain A2 was expressed in the presence of kifunensine (5 M), digested with 10% (w/w) Endo H overnight, mixed with a 2-fold or 1.5-fold molar excess of purified Fab for the AM22\u2013RSV F and RSD5-GL\u2013RSV F complexes. the resulting complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using the superose 6 X all Fabs were eluted off the CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 column using 50 mM acetic acid pH 4.0 into a buffered solution containing 1/10 (v/v) of 1 M Tris pH 8.0. to produce RSD5-WT Fab, the solution was expressed and purified as an IgG with an HRV 3C protease site in the hinge of the heavy chain. for the DS-Cav1 subtype A mutant with a K209Q substitution, only AM22 Fab was evaluated. for the assay evaluating binding to postfusion RSV F of subtype A or B, a concentration of 300 nM of each Fab in HBS-P+ buffer was used. data were collected at the X6A beamline (National Synchroton Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories) and scaled to 1.70. the best diffracting crystals of the complex of endo H-treated DS-Cav1 with AM22 Fab were produced via sitting-drop vapor diffusion. solution of 1.8 M lithium sulfate and 0.1 M Tris at pH 8.0 via hanging-drop vapor diffusion at a protein-to-reservoir ratio of 1:3. crystal looped directly from the crystallization drop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
