{"summary": "acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the main cause of mortality among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most frequent monogenic diseases. ACS associates fever and respiratory symptoms (including cough, dyspnea/acute respiratory failure, and chest pain) to new pulmonary infiltrates. prospective study in patients with ACS aims at studying relationship between regional lung structure, as assessed by density, and lung metabolism. ACS since 72 hours, defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray together with either a respiratory symptom (dyspnea or chest pain) or an abnormal sound on lung auscultation. gen tests for legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory virus detection by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swab. paired serum antibodies testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections. patients were discharged from the ICU when the following criteria were met. images were acquired using 3 to 4 bed positions of 2 minutes each. results were compared using a simplification approach in each lower and upper lobe. x-ray tube tension of 120 kV, current of 250 mAs, rotation time 0.5 s, pitch 0.938, and slice thickness 2 mm. median CT volume dose index was 721 mGy. a consolidation was defined as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation. three of these SCD patients had osseous vasoocclusive crises within 3 months of the PET/CT scans but none developed ACS. data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism version 5.00 for Windows statistical software. two-sided P values 0.05 were considered significant. ACS since 72 hours defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray. ACS since 72 hours, defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate. paired serum antibodies testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections. patients were discharged from the ICU when the following criteria were met. images were acquired using 3 to 4 bed positions of 2 minutes each. images were analyzed by 2 staff members who had no access to the medical charts of the patients. x-ray tube tension of 120 kV, current of 250 mAs, rotation time 0.5 s, pitch 0.938, and slice thickness 2 mm. a consolidation was defined as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation. atelectasis was defined by a reduced volume, accompanied by attenuation in the affected part of the lung. three of these SCD patients had osseous vasoocclusive crises within 3 months of the PET/CT scans. three of these patients had osseous vasoocclusive crises within 3 months of the PET/CT scans. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were admitted in our ICU for ACS during the study period. seventeen patients were thus included in the study, including 16 with SS disease and 1 with S-+ thalassemia disease. ground-glass opacities were rare, with no lobar predominance, and atelectasis was almost never observed. consolidated lower lobes of 2 distinct patients showed higher 18F-FDG uptake than those of ACS and SCD non-ACS controls. ACS = acute chest syndrome, HU = Hounsfield units, ROIs = regions of interest, SCD = sickle cell disease. results of 18F-FDG uptake parameters in patients with SUVmax >2.5 and 2.5 are presented in Table 2. lower lobes of patients with ACS exhibited higher SUVmax, as compared with upper lobes and lungs of SCD non-ACS controls. lower lobes of patients with ACS exhibited higher SUVmean. lower lobe ROIs exhibit HU values close to zero with scattered values of SUVmax. ACS = acute chest syndrome, ROIs = regions of interest, SCD = sickle cell disease. ACS = acute chest syndrome, HU = Hounsfield units, ROIs = regions of interest, SCD = sickle cell disease. the oxygen requirement was greater, with a trend toward higher arterial Pao2 levels and significantly lower Paco2 levels in patients with higher SUVmax as compared to others. ground-glass opacities were rare, with no lobar predominance. Pleural effusion was found in 13 patients, including 3 cases with unilateral effusion and 10 cases with bilateral effusion. none of the patients had pulmonary fibrosis. HU (A) and tissue fraction (B) were consistent with consolidation of lung tissue in ROIs of lower lobes. ROIs of upper lobes and lungs of SCD non-ACS controls showed normal aeration. results of 18F-FDG uptake parameters in patients with SUVmax >2.5 and 2.5 are presented in Table 2. FIGURE 3. Lung maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) without (A) and with (B) normalization for hepatic SUVmax. lower lobes of patients with ACS exhibited higher SUVmean than lungs of SCD non-ACS controls. ACS = acute chest syndrome, ROIs = regions of interest, SCD = sickle cell disease. lower lobe ROIs exhibit HU values close to zero with scattered values of SUVmax. ROIs with HU close to zero showed scattered values of SUVmax. TABLE 4 Characteristics of patients with Acute Chest Syndrome on the day of 18F-FDG PET Scan Acquisition Three patients were diagnosed with a pulmonary infection. another patient had B19 parvovirus primary infection. none of the included patients died during hospital stay nor required invasive mechanical ventilation support. lung 18F-FDG uptake was in the range of that reported in patients with lung contusion (2.2)24 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (2.8),23 but lower than that reported in the pulmonary parenchyma of patients with sarcoidosis (5.1) neutrophils are the main cells accounting for lung 18F-FDG uptake during ACS. the contribution of other inflammatory cells such as alveolar macrophages, monocytes, or lymphocyte study shows increased 18F-FDG uptake in lung bases during ACS. heterogeneity in lung bases exhibited more regional perfusion than apices. a positive relationship between perfusion and 18F-FDG uptake was demonstrated. previous studies in patients with lung contusion16 and the acute respiratory distress syndrome15 showed the ability of 18F-FDG PET to detect increased metabolism in regions with normal lung aeration. however, the pathophysiologic significance of the increased 18F-FDG uptake in normally aerated regions during ACS remains unclear and needs further studies. changes in 18F-FDG uptake in consolidated regions were not merely related to changes in lung density. this is consistent with the review of CT scans by a radiologist blinded to the interpretation of 18F-FDG PET scans. this is consistent with the review of CT scans by a radiologist blinded to the interpretation of 18F-FDG PET scans who confirmed that atelectasis was present in a minority of segments. the most severe patients (ie, those requiring mechanical ventilation) were excluded from this study because transport to the PET/CT facility was considered hazardous. using SUV, a static index does not allow for studying 18F-FDG kinetics parameters, only available with dynamic indexes. toxemia,27,28 ventilator-induced lung injury,12 smoke inhalation,29 and airway instillation of endotoxin in humans. this hypothesis is consistent with our finding of increased white blood cell counts in patients with lung SUVmax >2.5. the contribution of other inflammatory cells such as alveolar macrophages, monocytes, or lymphocytes to lung 18F-FDG uptake during ACS cannot be ruled out. a positive relationship between perfusion and 18F-FDG uptake would be expected. previous studies in patients with lung contusion16 and the acute respiratory distress syndrome15 showed the ability of 18F-FDG PET to detect increased metabolism in regions with normal lung aeration. increased 18F-FDG uptake in normally aerated regions during ACS remains unclear. changes in regional lung density can artificially increase 18F-FDG uptake measurements when lung density changes are related to loss of aeration. changes in regional 18F-FDG uptake in consolidated regions were not merely related to changes in lung density, as would occur in purely atelectatic lung regions. patients with SUVmax >2.5 were very homogeneous in terms of presentation and outcomes. none died nor required mechanical ventilation, thereby limiting the ability to show differences between groups of patients exhibiting different degrees of lung metabolism. some patients with severe ACS exhibit hypercapnia, probably reflecting hypoventilation related to chest pain. the mechanisms involved in the higher metabolism observed in upper lung regions of ACS patients are unclear. the mechanisms involved in the higher metabolism observed in upper lung regions of ACS patients as compared to SCD non-ACS controls are unclear."}
