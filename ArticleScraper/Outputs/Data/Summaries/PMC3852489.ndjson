{"summary": "a novel human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was identified as a pathogen causing a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease in the Middle East and Europe in 2012 [1]. the world health organization (WHO) had been informed of 138 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 60 deaths. development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is critical for early intervention and prevention. the RBD is attributed to residues 367-606 or 367-588 in MERS-CoV S1 [17]\u2013[19]. s377-588-Fc was constructed by fusing MERS-CoV residues 377-588 of S1 with Fc of human IgG. recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc. recombinant protein containing residues 377-662 or 358-588 of MERS-CoV S1 and human IgG Fc fragment can induce neutralizing antibody responses against infection of MERS-CoV in immunized mice. we expressed a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 fused with human IgG-Fc (S377-588-Fc) this protein could be highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells and purified to high purity. it was almost 1-fold greater than that under boiled condition in 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyzed bound proteins. antibodies specific for DPP4 and MERS-CoV S1 proteins were shown. only one band corresponding to the size of sDPP4 or S377-588-Fc monomer was indicated. Fc of human IgG (hIgG-Fc) without fusion with MERS-CoV S protein was included as the control. we then detected the interaction between S377-588-Fc protein and cellular DPP4 receptor on DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells using approaches similar to those described above. 88-Fc protein effectively inhibited MERS-CoV infection in bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells. hIgG-Fc protein at 25 g/ml, or even higher, exhibited no inhibition of CPE formation. S377-588-Fc protein induced strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibody responses with neutralizing activities in vaccinated mice. the results showed that S377-588-Fc induced increasing IgG antibody responses after each boost. the antibodies in the mouse sera could bind efficiently to both S-RBD fusion protein S377-588-Fc and MERS-CoV S1 protein without Fc. -588-Fc (S-RBD) in sera of mice at pre-immunization (pre-immune) and 10 days post-each vaccination. the data are presented as mean A450 SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells (NT50), and the results are presented as mean SD from five mice per group. antibody in antisera of mice immunized with S377-588-Fc protein effectively blocked S377-588 binding to DPP4 receptor. sera from PBS-vaccinated mice showed no significant inhibition on binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. recombinant protein containing residues 377-662 or 358-588 of MERS-CoV S1 and human IgG Fc fragment can induce neutralizing antibody responses in immunized mice or rabbits. we therefore believe that a truncated RBD sequence spanning residues 377-588 may contain the major neutralizing the bands of S377-588-Fc fusion protein in SDS-PAGE were confirmed by western blot using a polyclonal antibody against S1 of MERS-CoV. the bands were confirmed by antibodies against DPP4 or MERS-CoV S1 proteins. the sDPP4 and S377-588-Fc alone were included as the controls. the sDPP4 and S377-588-Fc alone were included as the controls. the protein molecular weight marker (kDa) is indicated on the left. the control protein hIgG-Fc did not show significant binding to sDPP4 or cell-associated DPP4. these results confirm the binding specificity of S377-588-Fc to DPP4. S377-588-Fc protein-mediated inhibition of MERS-CoV infection in vaccinated mice. hIgG-Fc was included as the control. hIgG-Fc was included as the control. titers of IgG specific to MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc (S-RBD) in sera. ability of IgG binding to MERS-CoV S-RBD (C) and S1 protein (D) was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. s377-588-Fc protein-vaccinated mouse sera was tested for neutralization of MERS-CoV infection in vero E6 cells. antibody-mediated blockage of receptor binding was shown in the control protein hIgG-Fc. strong signals were detected in S377-588-Fc-incubated Huh-7 cells. only background signals were observed in the control hIgG-Fc-incubated cells. the binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was effectively blocked. s 377-588 contains the RBM (residues 484-567) of MERS-CoV S protein S1 subunit. fusion of fusion protein with S377-588 was carried out in order to facilitate affinity-purification of the fusion protein using protein A beads [20], [28] and increase the immunogenicity of the Fc-containing protein [15], possibly through the binding of Fc in the protein to the Fc receptor. the peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor enfuvirtide has been used for treatment of cancer [34]\u2013[36]. the major concern for use of protein drugs in clinics is their production of antibodies, which may suppress drug efficacy. the major concern for use of protein drugs in clinics is their production of antibodies. the longer RBD fragment containing residues 589-662 contains non-neutralizing epitopes. the fragment may destabilize the core conformation of the RBD. cysteines 379 and 585 are involved in stabilizing the tertiary structure. the boundaries of the RBD and of the RBM are labeled by their residue numbers. previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV S-RBD-induced antibodies are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV S-RBD-binding to ACE2. antisera of mice vaccinated with the truncated S-RBD (S377-588) of MERS-CoV could also efficiently block the binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD to its receptor the viral receptor, DPP4, potently inhibit MERS-CoV infection in DPP4-expressing cells. it can also induce strong RBD-specific antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against infection from MERS-CoV. this truncated S-RBD linked with Fc shows potential for further development as both therapeutic and vaccine for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection. recombinant proteins were purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) or Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen, Valencia,
