{"summary": "this phenomenon was originally described in Fujinami et al. [1] and is hypothesized to play an important role in the development of certain autoimmune diseases. a related concept where peptide similarity drives immune recognition is the conservation of peptides in one pathogen across others. we developed 38 epitope sets derived from 11 allergens, 4 autoimmune diseases and 23 infectious diseases found in the IEDB. microbial sequence similarity increased the likelihood of immunogenicity for pathogen-derived sequences. we also studied sets of dominant epitopes, derived from antigens and allergens from various target indications. the sets encompass panels of epitopes from several known Timothy Grass allergens, Ragweed allergens, and antigens from house dust mites. in all cases, the epitope sets were derived from series of studies conducted in our laboratory. a BLOSUM matrix contains log-odds scores for each of the possible substitutions of the 20 amino acids. this formula assigns two 100% identical peptides a score of one. a cross-validation was performed using the ten groups. in the pro-allergic microbiota 614 bacterial taxa were predicted to encode 5,040 KOs. the number of taxa in the non-allergic house dust microbiota was similar. the predicted genomic content of both pro-allergic and non-allergic microbiota largely represented overlapping KOs. hits per category were sorted according to descending BLOSUM scores. from 14 inflammatory categories, epitopes were less similar than non-epitopes to the microbiome. top ten hits from epitope sets were also selected for analysis. each pool was at a final concentration of 2mg/ml per peptide. PBMC isolation was performed with approval from the Institutional Review Board. fluorescent spots were counted by computer-assisted image analysis using an AID iSPOT ELISPOT reader (AID-diagnostika, Germany) a peptide pool response had to match all of three different criteria: 1) elicit at least 20 net spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 PBMC. automated assembly of a set of validated HLA class II epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) sets of restricted epitopes were created using a method described in Carrasco Pro et al [11]. the database does not have any consistent information related to the vaccination status of subjects. sets of epitopes from several known Timothy Grass allergens, Ragweed allergens, and antigens from house dust mites and cockroaches. in all cases, epitope sets were derived from series of studies conducted in our laboratory. in all cases, the identification of these epitopes is described in peer reviewed reports [13\u201316]. b l ( a, b ) / b l ( b, b ) where a and b are the two peptides, the BLOSUM score for a and b was divided with the square root of the product of the BLOSUM score of the two peptides aligned with themselves. this formula assigns two 100% identical peptides a score of one. the predicted genomic content of both pro-allergic and non-allergic house dust microbiota represented overlapping KOs. we derived all the possible 15-mers from the protein sequences found in each of these groups of KOs. each 15-mer of the KOs from the non-allergic group was discarded from the analysis. ten high BLOSUM peptide hits were selected for each of the 23 categories. this corresponded to a total of 230 human microbiome peptides. similarity to the microbiome was estimated by BLOSUM score calculations. lla Institute for allergy and immunoology (protocols VD-101 and VD-071) no detailed clinical history including vaccination records is available for the participants. PBMCs were isolated from collected blood or leukapheresis by density gradient centrifugation. no cells producing both IL-10 and IFN were detected. four-digit HLA typing was performed at the la Jolla Institute. in all we defined 38 sets of indications/taxonomical origins for which there were at least 20 epitopes described in the literature. an exception was made in the case of Rheumatoid arthritis epitopes, where 11 epitopes were available. we also considered four different sets of epitopes associated with autoimmune diseases. 3E-04 Environment Plants Amaranthaceae 22 1123 0.605 0.640 0.02

microbiome sequence set. we then calculated the p-values associated with the epitope set being less similar to the human microbiome than the matching non-epitope. this could indicate a tolerogenic influence of the microbiome. epitopes were significantly more similar than non-epitopes to microbiome sequences. blue dots indicate non-epitopes being less conserved in the human microbiome.

peptides did not induce responses. results from table 1 show results from automatically generated epitope sets of corresponding and matching origin. no asterisk in the p-values denotes epitopes having significant median similarity score lower than the non-epitopes. in most cases the more dominant epitopes had more significant p-values. for each epitope or non-epitope sequence we selected the hits with a score above the threshold determined by the epitope or non-epitope median of max BLOSUM scores for the respective category. we then countd how frequently each microbiome microorganism was represented in these hits. the hits were then mapped back to the genus of origin from the microbiome sequence sets. phingobacterium 5 1.91 0.39 6E-04 7E-03 Eubacterium 7 2.67 0.99 0.02 0.02 Prevotella

categories based on epitope-associated assay information. in all we defined 38 sets of indications/taxonomical origins for which there were at least 20 epitopes described in the literature. each epitope set contained a median of 125 epitopes (range 11 to 2083) negative control sets contained a median of 2333 sequences (range 12 to 12182).

inflammatory vs. tolerogenic categories can be established at the genus level. microbiome peptides homologous to dominant epitopes are associated with constitutive IL-10 production. this is consistent with microbiome-epitope specific T cells existing in the host in a tolerant and quiescent state. exposure to the cross-reactive pathogen-derived epitopes may result in an inflammatory or tolerogenic outcome. categories Inflammatory categories Adenovirus Alphaproteobacteria Amaranthaceae Betaproteobacteria Aspergillus Clostridales Betaherpesviridae Dengue Cockroach Gluten Fabaceae Hepatitis B

peptides homologous to known epitopes. however, self-peptides that were homologous to these microbiome sequences were not associated with either IFN or IL-10 production. to test this, we analyzed 16S

15mers unique to non-allergic microbiomes. a BLOSUM score was calculated for each epitope and non-epitope sequence when compared to 15-mers from KOs unique to allergic microbiomes (41) and KOs unique to non-allergic microbiomes (150) the NCBI taxonomy IDs for each of the species were used to generate a list of taxa found in each microbiota. the maximum BLOSUM scores were calculated for the epitopes/non-epitopes per organism proteome. the results, shown in Fig 4B, are consistent with our previous findings. microbiome-based modulation of immune responses described herein is based on sequence homology between specific microbiome sequences and potential epitope sequences from allergens, pathogens or autoantigens. microbiome antigens and metabolites have been proposed to induce peripherally derived regulatory T cells. bound and microbiome-derived peptides must necessarily extend to highly homologous epitopes encoded in other protein sequences of pathogen, allergen or autoantigen origin. we propose that the microbiome influences the host immune reactivity both by general immunomodulatory mechanisms and antigen-specific modulation of immune responses. heterologous T cell immunity between microbes and self-antigens may extend the concept that (early life) exposure to microbes favors the development of clinical preliminary analysis did not detect significant effect in case of known class I epitopes. this result is in agreement with the hypothesis that the effects detected are based on the internalization and presentation of microbiome derived epitopes. this result is in agreement with the hypothesis that the effects detected are based on the internalization and presentation of microbiome derived epitopes through the exogenous HLA class II presentation pathway. some pathogens were in the \u201ctolerogenic\u201d category. some pathogens were in the \u201ctolerogenic\u201d category. some pathogens were in the \u201ctolerogenic\u201d category. genus
