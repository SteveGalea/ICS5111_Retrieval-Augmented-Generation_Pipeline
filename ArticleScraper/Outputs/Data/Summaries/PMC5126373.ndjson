{"summary": "influenza A viruses of avian origin are capable of crossing host species barriers, resulting in sporadic infection in humans. high-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses cause the highest mortality rate in humans, approximately 60% based on WHO reports. in vitro studies have shown that influenza virus infection can upregulate the expression of several endothelial adhesion molecules (14, 15), which may facilitate extravasation of neutrophils and macrophages into the alveoli. pulmonary endothelial cells are susceptible to HPAI H5N1 virus infection in an envelope-dependent manner. influenza virus (22), flavivirus (dengue and west Nile viruses) (23, 24), filovirus (Marburg and Ebola viruses) (23), and coronavirus (23) among all the IFITM members present in humans, IFITM3 has shown to be most potent antiviral factor in restricting influenza virus infection. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium 2 (EBM-2) (Lonza) with supplements as previously described (17) human brain vascular endothelial cells (HBVEC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% Nu-Serum (Fisher Scientific), 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 m reassortant viruses bearing HA and NA genes from VN/VN/04 (H5N1) or Anhui/1 (H7N9) virus and internal genes from the PR8 donor virus (VN:PR8 and Anhui:PR8) were grown in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs for 24 to 48 h. PR8 viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. they were then concentrated and purified by equilibrium density centrifugation through a 30 to 60% linear sucrose gradient. the concentrations of purified virus were determined using a bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) unbound virus particles incubated with prewarmed fusion buffer. cells were washed twice with prechilled viral infection medium. then incubated for 8 h with viral infection medium containing 30 mM NH4Cl. ten microliters of labeled PR8 viruses were bound to cells grown on 24-well plates on ice for 1 h, followed by washing three times with ice-cold viral infection medium. the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the anti. -M1 monoclonal antibody HB64 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was transfected with a mixture of IFITM3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or negative-control siRNA (catalog number AM4611) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) the knockdown effect on the IFITM3 protein expression level was confirmed by Western blotting. cells from either cell lines or primary culture were grown to confluence in T-75 flasks. the cells were trypsinized and resuspended at 2 106/ml. the samples were boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min before being loaded into a 4 to 15% mini-protean tris-glycine precast gel (Bio-Rad) primary human lung blood microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), immortalized human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HULEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium 2 (EBM-2) (Lonza) with supplements as previously described (17) influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN/04) (H5N1), A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anhui/1) (H7N9), A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-1156/2011 (CK/11) (H9N2), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (NL/03) (H7N7), A/sho reassortant viruses bearing HA and NA genes from VN/VN/04 (H5N1) or Anhui/1 (H7N9) virus and internal genes from the PR8 donor virus were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. the concentrations of purified virus were determined using a bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) acid-induced fusion assay at cell plasma membrane (acid bypass assay) influenza PR8 viruses were labeled with biotin and used in a virus internalization assay. 10 l of biotin-labeled virus was incubated with cells in viral infection medium. ten microliters of labeled PR8 viruses were bound to cells grown on 24-well plates on ice for 1 h, followed by washing three times with ice-cold viral infection medium. to induce internalization, the virus-bound cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 1 h in viral infection medium. MOI of 40 were bound to HULEC and A549 cells on ice for 1 h in viral infection medium. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-M1 monoclonal antibody HB64 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) rabbit anti-human CD107a (LAMP-1) and anti-human CD63 antibodies (BD Biosciences) mice anti-EEA1 and LAMP-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Western blotting. a group of selected avian influenza viruses exhibited extended tropism in human pulmonary endothelial cells. human influenza viruses of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes possess low infectivity in human pulmonary endothelial cells. avian influenza viruses, VN/04 (HPAI H5N1), Anhui/1 (LPAI H7N9), and CK/11 (LPAI H9N2), could effectively infect HULEC at an infection ratio of 0.65 or greater. the virus NL/03 (HPAI H7N7) and Shov/07 (LPAI H7N9) showed only intermediate infectivity in HULEC, as their infectivity in these cells was approximately 35 to 40% of that observed in A5 both recombinant influenza viruses showed enhanced viral infectivity in HULEC compared to PR8 virus. this suggests that the HA and NA genes represent the main determinants of influenza virus tropism in HULEC. avian influenza viruses of the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes have gained extended cellular tropism in human pulmonary endothelial cells. viral infection in permissive A549 cells was quantified based on NP staining. PR8 (H1N1) and Pan/99 (H3N2) viruses achieved 75% and 95% infectivity. infection rates of both viruses in HULEC reached up to 95% upon inducing fusion at the cell surface. two-way analysis of variance was done to compare viral infectivity at pH 5.0 and at pH 7.4, ***, P 0.001. human influenza viruses can become internalized and initiate hemifusion in endosomes but fail to uncoat during entry into endosomes. the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral contents into the cytosol and initiate replication. internalized viruses stained with Alexa 488-streptavidin after unconjugated streptavidin preincubation were visible in both HULEC and A549 cells. both cell surface-bound and internalized viruses were shown by Alexa-488 streptavidin staining without unconjugated preincubatioin. the images were taken under a 63 oil objective lens. PR8 virus M1 proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence using anti-M1 antibody (HB64) at 3.5 h postinternalization and DAPI (blue) for nuclei. the images were taken with an LSM 710 Zeiss inverted confocal microscope under a 40 objective lens with digital zoom 2. PR8 virus can initiate hemifusion (lipid mixing) in HULEC. as a negative fusion control, virus internalization was induced in the presence of 30 mM NH4Cl to inhibit endosomal acidification. as a result, internalized viruses could no longer fuse in HULEC. PR8 virus M1 protein was mainly trapped in late endosome/lysosome compartments during entry into HULEC. the virus replication restriction factor IFITM3 is constitutively expressed in human endothelial cells but at a significantly lower level in epithelial cells. we first examined whether human endothelial cells constitutively express IFITM3 without interferon induction. lysates were detected by anti-IFITM3 antibody in a Western blot assay. actin expression was monitored by anti-actin antibody blotting. the relative IFITM3 protein expression was plotted as the mean ratio of the intensity of the IFITM3 signal to that of the actin internal control from three independent experiments. FITM3 knockdown by siRNA in HULEC partially enhances human influenza virus infection. 100 pmol of IFITM3 siRNA could significantly downregulate IFITM3 expression in HULEC prior to virus infection. negative-control siRNA and negative-control siRNA were transfected in HULEC. expression of IFITM3 siRNA was examined at 72 h posttransfection by Western blotting with anti-IFITM3 antibody. anti-actin antibody was included as an internal loading control. avian influenza viruses can fuse in early endosomes at relatively high pH values before traveling to late endosomes. we used a virus-mediated hemolysis assay to compare viral fusion pHs for selected human and avian influenza viruses. the virus that displayed the highest infectivity in HULEC had a fusion threshold of approximately pH 5.8. za viruses at 128 HAU were incubated with 1% turkey erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C for 1 h before fusion was induced with 100 l of fusion buffer at pHs ranging from 4.8 to 7.4. the hemolysis efficiencies at various pHs were expressed as percentages of the maximum hemolysis. human influenza viruses of H1 and H3 subtypes exhibited very limited viral infection rates in HULEC with an infection ratio below 0.1 compared to viral infection rates in A549 cells. unlike human influenza viruses, the avian influenza viruses, VN/04 (HPAI H5N1), Anhui/1 (LPAI H7N9), and CK/11 (LPAI H9N2), could efficiently infect HULEC at an infection ratio of 0.65 or greater. recombinant PR8 viruses harboring the HA and NA genes from anhui/1 or VN/04 showed enhanced viral infectivity in HULEC compared to PR8 virus. this suggests that the HA and NA genes represent the main determinants of influenza virus tropism in HULEC. viral infectivity in presence of 30 mM NH4Cl was quantified based on NP staining. PR8 (H1N1) and Pan/99 (H3N2) viruses could achieve 75% and 95% infectivity. infection rates of both viruses in HULEC reached up to 95% upon inducing fusion at the cell surface. viral infectivity expressed as the mean percentage of NP-positive cells. two-way analysis of variance was done to compare viral infectivity at pH 5.0 and at pH 7.4, ***, P 0.001. internalized viruses stained with Alexa 488-streptavidin after unconjugated streptavidin preincubation were visible in both HULEC and A549 cells. this suggests that PR8 virus can become internalized into HULEC with an efficiency similar to that in A549 cells. both cell surface-bound and internalized viruses were shown by Alexa-488 streptavidin staining without unconjugated preincubatioin. the images were taken under a 63 oil objective lens. lipid mixing between the viral membrane and host endosomal membrane was indicated by increased intensity of green fluorescence due to the release of self-quenching DiOC18 and dissolution of FRET. virus internalization was induced in the presence of 30 mM NH4Cl to inhibit endosomal acidification. as a result, internalized viruses could no longer fuse in HULEC. results obtained in this cell line generally similar to those observed for HULEC. we performed colocalization immunostaining with an early endosome marker (EEA1) and a late endosome/lysosome marker (LAMP-1) the overlap coefficient of M1 with EEA1 was 0.34, and it was 0.73 for M1 with LAMP-1. the blocking of human influenza virus infection in HULEC is at a posthemifusion step; as a result, virus can no longer uncoat nucleocapsid. IFITM3 expression in endothelial cells was detected by anti-IFITM3 antibody in a Western blot assay. actin and IFITM3 protein expression levels in the Western blot were quantified with a ChemiDoc MP system with Image Lab software. the endogenous IFITM3 proteins (red) in HULEC were colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA1 (green) and the lysosomal marker LAMP endogenous IFITM3 knockdown by siRNA in HULEC partially enhances human influenza virus infection. we used silencing RNA (siRNA) to knock down IFITM3 expression in HULEC prior to virus infection. IFITM3 proteins restrict PR8 virus infection in endothelial cells. different amounts (12.5 to 100 pmol) of IFITM3 siRNA and negative-control siRNA were transfected in HULEC. expression of IFITM3 was examined at 72 h posttransfection by Western blotting. avian influenza viruses, including HPAI H5N1, LPAI H9N2, and novel LPAI H7N9 viruses, show significantly higher infection rates than H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza viruses in endothelial cells. avian influenza viruses can fuse in early endosomes at relatively high pH values before traveling to late endosomes. avian influenza viruses, like Anhui/1 and VN/04, fuse early before reaching late endosomes to avoid IFITM3 restriction. other viruses, such as CK/11 virus, may explore other, unknown routes to escape this restriction in endothelial cells. human pulmonary endothelial HULEC are less permissive to human influenza virus infection than a subset of avian influenza viruses. human pulmonary endothelial HULEC are less permissive to human influenza virus infection than a subset of avian influenza viruses. avian influenza viruses, such as HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9, were able to replicate efficiently in endothelial cells and induce strong cytokine production in vivo. postmortem analysis of patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection rarely showed endotheliotropism. IFITM3 restricts viral infection by blocking the formation of fusion pores following virus-endosome hemifusion. in unstimulated WI-38 human primary fibroblasts, the majority of IFITM3 resides in the ER and becomes distributed in a vesicular pattern throughout the cell. a subset of avian influenza viruses from the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes seemed to be able to partially escape this restriction block in endothelial cells. this suggests a potential role for endosome-residing constitutively expressed IFITM3 proteins in this block. this suggests a role for other restriction factors in endothelial cells. CK/11 H9N2 virus was able to achieve high infectivity in HULEC. avian influenza viruses were able to escape restriction in endothelial cells by fusing early, before reaching late endosomes. avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to -2,3-linked sialic acids. previously, it had been suggested that HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses with different receptor binding specificities might be sensed or recognized differently in human monocyte-derived macrophages."}
