{"summary": "SARS-CoV Urbani and WIV1 share homology at 11 of the 14 contact residues with human ACE2. the three amino acid changes represent relatively conservative substitution not predicted to ablate binding (Fig. 1B). exploring WIV1 strains allows examination of emergence, pathogenesis potential, and adaptation requirements. Western blot analysis suggests potential differences in spike cleavage/processing of WIV1 and SARS-CoV spike proteins. the ratio of full length to cleaved spike varied between SARS spikes (Urbani, 1.21; MA15, 1.44) and WIV1 (full length, 0.61; WIV1-MA15, 0.25) signaling possible variation in host proteolytic processing. samples were collected at individual time points with biological replicates. previous examination of WIV1-CoV recovered from bat samples demonstrated poor replication in A549 cells (5). however, replication of epidemic SARS-CoV is also poor in this cell type, potentially due to ACE2 expression levels (9) titer in the lung also revealed reduced replication following WIV1-MA15 challenge compared with control. meanwhile, lung antigen staining indicated distinct attenuation of the WIV1-MA15, with most staining occurring in the airways and absent from large regions of the lungs. we examined the full-length WIV1-CoV versus the epidemic SARS-CoV Urbani strain in vivo. however, viral replication was significantly attenuated for WIV1-CoV compared with SARS-CoV Urbani. PCR-positive, 10- to 20-wk-old HFH4-ACE2\u2013expressing mice were infected with 105 pfu of WIV1-CoV or SARS-CoV Urbani. titers for HFH4-hACE2 were 100-fold higher in the presence of human ACE2 compared with wild-type BALB/c. titers for WIV1-CoV were 100-fold higher in the presence of human ACE2 HFH4-ACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV Urbani lost >20% body weight. mice with >10% weight loss produced robust viral replication in the brain. augmented replication suggests that WIV1-CoV may bind the human ACE2 receptor more efficiently than the mouse ACE2. we first tested a SARS-CoV monoclonal derived via phage display and antibody escape (Fm6) (14) and found both wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani and WIV1-MA15 were strongly neutralized at low antibody concentrations. both antibodies 230.15 and 227.14 robustly inhibited WIV1-MA15 replication. HFH4 ACE2-expressing mice were injected with 200 g of anti-SARS human antibody 227.15 (hatched line) or mock (solid line) 1 d before infection with 1 105 pfu of SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or WIV1-CoV (blue) mice were subsequently challenged with either SARS-CoV Urbani or WIV1-CoV and monitored for 7 d. ated by both formalin and UV irradiation (double inactivated virus, DIV) was demonstrated as a potential vaccination candidate based on robust neutralization and protection following homologous SARS-CoV challenge in young mice (18). however, both aged animal and heterologous challenge studies revealed incomplete protection, increased immune pathology, and eosinophilia, indicating the possibility of adverse effects following DIV vaccination. 104 pfu of WIV1-MA15 via the i.n route. weight loss following WIV1-MA15 challenge and viral replication in the lung 4 DPI. initial studies compared WIV1-MA15 to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) to determine spike-dependent pathogenesis. ten-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 104 plaque forming units (pfu) of WIV1-MA15 or SARS-CoV MA15 and followed over a 4-d time course. ten-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 105 pfu of either SARS-CoV Urbani (black), WIV1-CoV (blue), or SARS-CoV MA15 (gray) and examined over a 4-d time course. weight loss (n = 6 for WIV1-CoV, n = 6 for SARS-CoV Urbani) and lung titer (n = 3 for WIV1-CoV, the results indicate significant attenuation of WIV1-CoV relative to the epidemic SARS-CoV in wild-type mice. the absence of clinical disease in the epidemic strains of SARS-CoV suggests that the mouse model may not be adequate to access human disease potential. all HFH4-ACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV Urbani lost >20% body weight. titers for WIV1-CoV were 100-fold higher in the presence of human ACE2 compared with wild-type BALB/c. mice with rapid weight loss were predicted to have lethal encephalitis. we first tested a SARS-CoV monoclonal derived via phage display and antibody escape (Fm6) and found both wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani and WIV1-MA15 were strongly neutralized at low antibody concentrations. a panel of monoclonal antibodies derived from B cells from SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients also prevented virus infection via WIV1-CoV spike (15, 16) HFH4 ACE2-expressing mice were injected with 200 g of anti-SARS human antibody 227.15 (hatched line) or mock (solid line) 1 d before infection with 1 105 pfu of SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or WIV1-MA15 (blue) mice were subsequently challenged with either SARS-CoV Urbani or WIV1-CoV and monitored for 7 d. 7.14 protected mice from both lethal SARS-CoV Urbani and WIV-CoV challenge. lung titers revealed no detectable virus in either HFH4-ACE2-expressing mouse lungs. a mixture of broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV would likely provide significant protection if WIV1-CoV\u2013like viruses successfully transmitted to humans. double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV vaccine fails to protect aged animals from chimeric WIV1-CoV. twelve-month-old mice were vaccinated and boosted with DIV (dotted line) or PBS (solid line) and infected 21 d postboost with 104 pfu of WIV1-MA15 via the i.n. route. synthetic genome design, transgenic mouse models, and therapeutic human antibodies to identify and treat potential prepandemic viruses. the approach indicates that viruses using the WIV1-CoV spike protein are capable of infecting HAE cultures directly without further spike adaptation. in vivo attenuation of WIV1-CoV relative to SARS-CoV Urbani suggests additional factors contribute to epidemic emergence. adaptation outside of spike protein may lead to emergence via altered host\u2013virus interactions. studies in nonhuman primates are required to confirm these results. despite the differences in the backbone genome sequences, therapeutics developed against SARS-CoV provide some measure of protection in the context of a future outbreak. a number of novel platforms including VRP and live-attenuated vaccine approaches show great promise in these areas, but require further testing and development before deployment in an outbreak setting. for SARS-like WIV1-CoV, the data can inform surveillance programs, improve diagnostic reagents, and facilitate effective treatments. the data illustrate the utility of the platform and highlight the need to build and maintain preparations for future emergence events. wild-type and chimeric WIV-CoV infectious clones were designed using published sequences and based on the SARS-CoV infectious clone (10). female 10-wk- and 12-mo-old Balb/cAnNHsD mice ordered from the Harlan Labs were infected as previously described. for vaccination, young and aged mice were vaccinated and boosted by footpad injection with a 20-L volume of either 0.2 g of double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. images were captured using an Olympus DP71 microscope. titer assays were preformed with previously characterized antibodies against SARS-CoV. wild-type and chimeric coVs were cultured on vero E6 cells. growth curves in vero and primary human airway epithelial cells were performed. human lungs were procured under university of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ACE2 were generated by microinjection of fertilized C3H C57BL/6 (C3B6) oocytes with an expression cassette consisting of the HFH4/FOXJ1 lung ciliated epithelial cell-specific promoter elements. ACE2-transgenic mice were each previously tested for transgene expression as described in SI Materials and Methods. plates were incubated for 2 d at 37 \u00b0C and stained with neutral red for 3 h. plaque reduction was calculated as [1 (no. of plaques with antibody/no. of plaques without antibody)] 100."}
