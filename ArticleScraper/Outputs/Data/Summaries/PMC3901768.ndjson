{"summary": "school closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic. school closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size. the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility. japanese experience demonstrated that the proactive closure can be very helpful in achieving local extinction. there has been a variation in published opinions toward another type of closure, \"the reactive closure,\" i.e., the closure of schools when many children, staff or both are experiencing illness. d epidemic model describes the time- and age-dependent transmission dynamics of influenza. let ja(t) be the incidence (i.e. number of new infections) of influenza in age-group a at calendar time t. subscripts 1, 2 and 3 represent children, young adults and elderly. the basic reproduction number, R0, represents the average number of secondary cases produced by a single 'typical' primary case in a fully susceptible population. the matrix M = [Mij] is referred to as the contact matrix. if the closure influences only the contact among children, we would simplify the issue by rescaling (1,1)-element, i.e., K't = t s 1 ( t ). za represents the final size (i.e. the cumulative incidence) of age group a, i.e., z a = 0 j a x dx - j a 0 (10) The present study focuses on the cumulative risk of infection. the frequency of such annual leave among businessmen has been surveyed by Mizumoto et al. [15], showing that up to 16% of daylight time workers were influenced by the school closure. parental absenteeism was as high as 26.7% among households with at least one infected child, and this proportion was 10.4% otherwise [15]. in the united states, the acceptable threshold of ICER tends to lie around 100,000 US dollars and 30,000 British Pound per life year. the size of each age group is assumed as proportional to age-specific population sizes of those aged from 0\u201319, 20\u201359 and 60 years and over. j1(0) = 1 (while j2(0) = j3(0) = 0), and all residents are assumed as initially susceptible. their relative susceptibility per contact depends on age, i.e., (1, 2, 3) = (1.000,0.370,0.059) as empirical evidence suggests [11,19] the cost effectiveness of school closure is examined using a single-layer epidemic model. we consider an age-structured epidemic model that describes the time- and age-dependent transmission dynamics of influenza in age-group a at calendar time t. in the present study, we consider 3 3 matrix, describing within and between group transmissions between/among children, young adults and elderly. subscripts 1, 2 and 3 represent children, young adults and elderly. the basic reproduction number, R0, representing the average number of secondary cases produced by a single 'typical' primary case in a fully susceptible population is computed as the largest eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix (4). the matrix M = [Mij] is referred to as the contact matrix. if the closure influences only the contact among children, we would simplify the issue by rescaling (1,1)-element. as K't = t s 1 ( t ) R 11 t s 1 ( t ) R 12 s 1 t R 13 t s 2 ( t ) R 21 s 2 t R 22 s 2 t R 23 s 3 t R 31 s 3 t R 32 s 3 t R 33, (9) where (t) represents the relative increase in the reproduction number between children and young adults due to compensatory behaviour of children with young adults the age-specific estimates of IFR are extracted from empirical study in Hong Kong. we compare the absolute difference of L between two scenarios, i.e. with and without school closure, L1 and L0 (i.e., L0-L1), yielding the life-years saved by the school closure. school closure involves the cost of forced annual leave among parents during the closure. the population size to multiply u0 is calculated by subtracting the cumulative incidence from N2/2. c is given as the product of hourly wage, the average working hours (per day) and the cost to be paid for workers during school closure [16], yielding c = 10,019.52 Japanese Yen. the parameters of contact matrix are derived from previous study with an identical age categorization [17] which assumed that the age-specific contact pattern in Japan is not different from that in England [18]. in our scenario, an epidemic takes place with an introduction of single infected child j1(0) = 1 (while j2(0) = j3(0) = 0), and all residents are assumed as initially susceptible, i.e., (1, 2, 3) = (1,1,1,1) the above-mentioned parameters correspond to empirically measured results from pandemic H1N1-2009. we also measure the sensitivity of ICER to different levels of transmission potential and risks of death, varying R0 from 1.2 to 1.8. a sharp decline in the child incidence was observed, and it influenced the transmission dynamics of adults and elderly. panel A shows the sensitivity of the cumulative incidence to variable timing and lengths of school closure. the largest reduction of final size was observed by implementing the closure at the peak of the epidemic. cost effectiveness analysis of school closure Figure 3 shows ICER values with various timing and lengths of school closure. the ICER appeared to be a monotonically increasing function of the length of closure. panel A examines ICER as a function of the risk of death relative to assumed baseline of H1N1-2009 pandemic and the length of school closure. the relative risk of death of assumed pandemic is expressed as multiplier to the infection fatality risk of H1N1-2009. school closure is implemented for 7 days from day 50. the cumulative incidence of children, young adults and elderly was 103242 (58.2%), 66156 (13.2%) and 3142 (0.9%), respectively, yielding the final size of 17.3% for the entire population. the highest incidence was observed at Day 61. the cumulative incidence was minimized if the closure was started at Day 61. the largest reduction of final size was observed by implementing the closure at the peak of the epidemic. the ICER remained above the acceptable threshold for all the assumed parameter space for H1N1-2009. the ICER appeared to be a monotonically increasing function of the length of closure. for both the timing and length, the variations in the efficacy of closure and proportion of contacts compensated had only marginal impact on ICER. the timing of epidemic peak varied with R0. the time for ICER to take the minimum value also greatly varied with R0. all the ICER values were above the acceptable threshold in Figure 4A. school closure at the epidemic peak appeared to minimize the cumulative incidence, but the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on R0. if the virulence is three times or greater than that of H1N1-2009, the cost of closure could be justified. if a particular strain is virulent, school closure intervention could be cost effective. the cost-effectiveness of school closure depends on the severity of pandemic, characterized by the transmissibility and virulence. one should also know that the cost-effective interventions of a particular influenza strain are different from those for other strains. the impact of school closure on social mixing patterns should ideally be based on more realistically socially structured (layered) modelling approach [29]. the effectiveness of school closure depends on the transmission dynamics of a particular influenza virus strain, especially the virulence. there is no fixed timing and duration of school closure that can be recommended as universal guideline for different types of influenza viruses. contact matrix M is given by M = M * 1 0 0 0 1 N 2 0 0 0 1 N 1 - (A3) In the event of school closure, the contact rate among school children is expected to decrease. as t = 1 for t t 0 or t t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +, q for t 0 t 0 +,
