{"summary": "PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages. the annual loss associated with PRRS is approximately 664 million USD. PRRS is a member of the Arteriviridae virus family in the order Nidovirales. antiviral therapeutics could be an alternative or additional control measure to combat these viral infections when a successful vaccine matches the circulating virus is not available. however, no such effective drugs are commercially available to prevent PRRSV infection. Compound 2 was quantitatively obtained from the reaction of 2,4,6-trihydroacetophenone (1) with dimethyl sulfate in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetone. the corresponding acetophenone 2 was then subjected to the Claisen\u2013Schmidt condensation reaction with 1-naphthaldehyde (3) in the presence of potassium hydroxide in methanol. the highest concentration (0.06 mM) caused the complete suppression of VR2332 replication. the highest concentration (0.06 mM) caused the complete suppression of VR2332 replication. the highest concentration (0.06 mM) caused the complete suppression of VR2332 replication. serum viremia measured in pig serum from each group at 0 (before challenge), 7, 14, and 28 dpc by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) one pig (1, 4 or 7) in each group was challenged with VR2332 and maintained in the group with the other two unchallenged pigs. pig challenged with VR2332 had a peak viral titer of 104.18 TCID50/mL at 7 dpc. the viral titer gradually decreased to 100.93 TCID50/mL at 28 dpc. the other unchallenged pig (6) did not show viremia at up to 7 dpc. pigs in group 1 (NC) showed an average peak viremia titer of 104.67 TCID50/mL at 7 dpc, which gradually decreased to 101.54 TCID50/mL at 28 dpc. pigs in group 2 (DiNap at 0.04 mM) and 3 (DiNap at 0.2 mM) had average titers of 102.47 TCID50/mL all 3 pigs (1 to 3) in group 1 (NC) became seropositive at 14 dpc. in group 2, two pigs became seropositive at 14 dpc. the other unchallenged pig (6) in the same group became seropositive at 21 dpc. the average daily weight gain (ADWG) was measured for all pigs in each group up to 28 dpc. diNap significantly enhanced the ADWG for both treatment groups. ADWG was calculated for the pigs in each group at 28 days. the pigs in groups 2 and 3 exhibited average virus titers of 103.28 TCID50/mL and 102.68 TCID50/mL, respectively. in group 1, the pig (1) challenged with VR2332 had a virus titer of 104.84 TCID50/mL in its lung tissue. in group 2, the pig (4) challenged with the virus had a virus titer of 102.10 TCID50/ viral RNA was extracted from the lung, and viral loads in the lung tissues were quantified by qRT-PCR. the viral loads were measured and expressed as TCID50/mL equivalents based on the standard curve of the Ct number plotted against the known virus titer of VR2332. diNap did not show significant toxicity in MARC-145 cells. highest concentration caused complete suppression of VR2332 replication. lowest concentration (0.01 mM) did not exert significant effect on viral replication. an assay was conducted on both cell lines to assess the cytotoxicity of DiNap in MARC-145 cells (C) and PAMs (D) at the same concentrations described above. cytotoxicity data are expressed as relative cell viability. v indicates the pig challenged with virus in each group. the pig (1) challenged with VR2332 had the highest viral load. virus titers decreased to 101.39 TCID50/mL at 28 dpc. the pig (7) challenged with VR2332 had peak viremia with a virus titer of 104.08 TCID50/mL at 7 dpc. the virus titer gradually decreased to 101.02 TCID50/mL at 28 dpc. pigs in group 1 showed an average peak viremia titer of 104.67 TCID50/mL at 7 dpc. pigs in group 1 (NC) became seropositive at 14 dpc and the S/P ratio gradually increased up to 28 dpc. in group 2, the challenged pig (7) became seropositive at 14 dpc. the two other unchallenged pigs in the same group were seronegative at up to 14 dpc. specific antibodies (IgG) were detected in the serum samples using a commercially available ELISA kit (IDEXX PRRS X3 Ab Test) the results are expressed as the S/P ratio of the samples, with S/P 0.4 considered positive for the PRRSV antibody (IgG) the pigs in groups 2 and 3 exhibited average virus titers of 103.28 TCID50/mL and 102.68 TCID50/mL. in group 1, the pig (1) challenged with VR2332 had a virus titer of 104.84 TCID50/mL in its lung tissue. in group 2, the pig (4) challenged with the virus had a virus titer of 102.10 TCID50/mL both unchallenged pigs (8 and 9) in the same group also had lower virus titers of 102.98 and 103.11 TCID50/mL in their lung tissues than the titers found in both unchallenged pigs (2 and 3) in group 1. the level of viremia was calculated and expressed as a TCID50/mL equivalent based on the standard curve of the cycle threshold (Ct) number plotted against the known virus titer of VR2332. the measured virus titers are presented for individual animals (A) and as an average for each group (B) pc was also lower than the titers in both unchallenged pigs (2 and 3) in group 1. the other unchallenged pig (6) did not show viremia at up to 7 dpc. the other unchallenged pig (6) did not show viremia at up to 7 dpc. the pigs in group 2 (DiNap at 0.04 mM) and 3 (DiNap at 0.2 mM) had average titers of 102.47 TCID50/mL and 101.36 TCID50/mL, respectively, at 7 dpc. this was approximately 100-fold (p 0.05) and 1000-fold (p 0.001) lower than the average titer observed in the pigs in group 1 ( the antibody (IgG) titers were found among the groups. these results suggest that DiNap delayed viral transmission among pigs. pigs in groups 2 and 3 exhibited average virus titers of 103.28 TCID50/mL and 102.68 TCID50/mL. pigs in groups 2 and 3 exhibited average virus titers of 103.28 TCID50/mL and 102.68
