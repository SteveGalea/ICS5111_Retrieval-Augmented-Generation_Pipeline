{"summary": "steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) is a common orthopaedic problem. steroids are initially prescribed for many non-orthopedic medical conditions. such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), organ transplantation, asthma, rheumatologic arthritis (RA) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rabbits were intensively used for establishing ON model where either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [27] or methylprednisolone (MPS) [12], [28], [29] or their combination (LPS+MPS) [13], [13] were tested. all of them showed effectiveness in ON induction, yet with varying degrees of ON lesions and mortality of animals. intravenous injection of pentobarbital via jugular vein at 24 weeks post injection. three injections of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Peapack, NJ, USA) with 10 mg/kg body weight were given intramuscularly at gluteus muscle at an interval of 2 days. each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle with 40 mg Omeprazole Sodium. blood was sampled at baseline, week 2, 4 and 8 post induction for routine blood examination. serum parameters related to lipid metabolism, including Total Cholesterol (TC), Total Glycerin (TG), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) were tested using standard clinical laboratory protocols for blood chemistry in shenzhen second peoples' hospital. mal femur was scanned using a high-resolution peripheral CT (HR-pQCT) at a voltage of 70 kV and a current of 114 uA. 2-dimentiaonal (2\u2013D) images were realigned in the Z-axis along the direction of femoral neck for further evaluation. sections were sliced along the coronal plane for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and fast green and safranin O staining respectively. the entire area of each stained section was examined for the presence of ON with the established criteria. the femoral head with at least one ON lesion was considered as ON+, while that with no ON lesion was considered as ON- [11], [35]. the thickness of cartilage at the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head was also examined. the proteoglycans content was quantified by measuring the thickness of safranin O stained articular cartilage. SAON was defined as the number of SAON emus divided by total number of emus in each group, and analyzed with fisher's exact test. the serum parameters were expressed as Mean SD, and analyzed with a post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle at an interval of 2 days. each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle with 40 mg Omeprazole Sodium. each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle with 40 mg Omeprazole Sodium and orally with 250 mg Amoxicillin Dispersible per day for 7 days immediately after induction. nogen (FBG) and Thrombin Time (TT) were tested using standard clinical laboratory protocols for blood chemistry in shenzhen second peoples' hospital. gait of emus with SAON was recorded regularly after induction by recording abnormal gait pattern using a video camera. femoral heads were sawed in half longitudinally along the coronal plane. sections were sliced along the coronal plane for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and fast green and safranin O staining. the femoral head with at least one ON lesion was considered as ON+. that with no ON lesion was considered as ON- [11], [35] fat cells were quantified for both average of fat cell size and fat cell area fraction. the total bone marrow was 200 fold magnified and captured. MMA embedded femoral heads were sectioned along the sawed plane using a diamond saw. surfaces were acid-etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 2\u201310 seconds, followed by 5% sodium hypochlorite for 20 minutes. samples were then sputter-coated with gold and palladium. fat cells were quantified for both average of fat cell size and fat cell area fraction. total bone marrow in subchondral bone was 200 fold magnified and captured. fat cell size was defined as total marrow fat cell area normalized by total marrow tissue area. ed plane was polished using a diamond saw (Isomet, Buehler) the surfaces were acid-etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 2\u201310 seconds, followed by 5% sodium hypochlorite for 20 minutes. the samples were then sputter-coated with gold and palladium. emus was found from MRI images in the first 12 weeks after induction. no collapse was found in the first 12 weeks after lPS-MPS induction. gait patterns All emus were observed to be less active but with normal gait in the next day after the first LPS injection. asymmetric limping gait was only observed when the emus were walking. micro-CT analysis was performed for the trabecular bone microarchitecture in the subchondral region (Figure 4E and F) and in the center of the femoral head (Figure 4G and H) no statistically significant difference was found for all micro-CT indices of trabecular bone in the centre of the femoral head between the control and SAON group. the subchondral bone region BMD (mg/cm3) 210.278 20.571 152.906 27.509 * BV/TV (%) 47.85 3.99 33.18 3.76 * Tb.N (1/mm) 1.261 0.132 1.148 0.076 * Tb.Th (mm) 0.502 0.038 0.407 0.061 * Tb.Sp (mm) 0.882 0.087 1.023 0.016 * Mean SD, *: P0.05 thickness of subchondral plate of femoral head of SAON emus decreased significantly. articular cartilage of SAON emus also showed pathological alteration with significantly thinner thickness. osteonecrosis located at collapsed region. safranin O stained femoral head in the control group (F1) and in SAON group (F2). normal cartilage in the control group (F1) and in SAON group (F2). normal cartilage in the control group (F1) and in SAON group (F2). in normal control, osteocytes are found on the solid bone matrix without obvious removal after acid processing. in the collapsed femur head region, osteocytes are presented without bone matrix surrounding, i.e. bone matrix removed after acid processing. no collapse was found in the first 12 weeks after induction. TG did not show significant increase post-induction (Figure 2B) however, no significant difference was found for the time course changes in serum parameters related to coagulation post-induction. all five emus in the SAON group developed edema, an early stage sign of ON at bilateral hip based on MRI observations. incidence of hip joint collapse was 70% (7 out of 10 hips from 5 emus) found in the SAON group. there was no collapse of the hip found in control group. no statistically significant difference was found for all micro-CT indices of trabecular bone in the centre of the femoral head. control (n = 3, from 6 bilateral hips) SAON (n = 5, from 10 bilateral hips) the central part of the femoral head BMD (mg/cm3) 169.767 29.174 171.301 42.791 BV/TV (%) 27.37 4.62 28.45 5.15 Tb.N (1/mm) 70% of 10 hips from 5 emus in the SAON group developed hip collapse. osteonecrosis was distributed in whole femoral head, including subchondral bone (Figure 5B2, E), middle of the femoral head (Figure 5C2) and femoral neck (Figure 5D) d arranged fat cells, with some blood cells effused out of the vessel. at the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head, the number of blood vessels of SAON group was significantly less than that of the normal group (p0.05, Figure 6G). in emu femoral head there were significantly higher adipocyte fraction (A), higher adipocyte size (B), thinner subchondral plate (C), thinner cartilage (D), thinner safranin O staining (E), smaller % Ob. Pm (F) and significant more blood vessels per slides at collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head (G). MRI of emu hips merely shows bone marrow edema without typical band pattern shown in initial MRI signaling of ON patients. this could be explained by the differences in anatomy and physiology of human (mammals) and emu (aves), such as that the bone marrow of emu hip presented in subchondral bone in a shell-shaped region. induction was evidenced by a significant increase in TC at all examined time point post-induction. however, there was no significant difference in coagulation-related parameters after induction. hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolysis state were reported in both SAON rabbit model [9], [11] and SARS ON patients [49]. femoral head implied pulsed steroid administration did not result in general osteoporosis. no difference in boney structural and BMD was found between SAON emus and normal controls in regions away from the subchondral bone. steroid administration was known to be able to induce secondary osteoporosis in patients [55] or animals. the occurrence of hip joint collapse in large bipedal emus was apparent more (7 out of 10 hips from 5 emus) than clinical data. the occurrence of hip joint collapse in emus was apparent more (7 out of 10 hips from 5 emus) than clinical data, such as 32.7% SAON incidence reported in SARS patients who were treated with a high dose of corticosteroid. new % increased 2 weeks post induction and decreased gradually to baseline level from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post induction. no typical clinical Shwartzman reaction was observed in emus. it would be of interest to study in details the differences in physical or immune responses between human and birds in SAON in future. this was the first experimental study to confirm that a combined injection protocol of pulsed LPS and MPS was able to induce ON and deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in bipedal emus. this was the first experimental study to confirm that a combined injection protocol of pulsed LPS and MPS was able to induce ON and deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in bipedal emus.
