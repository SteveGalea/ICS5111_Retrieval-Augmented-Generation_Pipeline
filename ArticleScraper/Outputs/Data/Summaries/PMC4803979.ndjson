{"summary": "emergency medicine (EM) is well positioned to connect biomedical and public health approaches for preventing disease as well as injury and promoting health through population-based strategies targeted at the community. access to the emergency department (ED) is available for two-thirds of patients admitted to hospitals in the united states. the ED recognizes and attracts attention to major social problems that impact the health of the public. EM also play a great role as a public health partner capable of monitoring and providing input regarding policies that affect public health along a number of dimensions. the ED of al-Thaghor hospital contains two rooms, each of which has nine beds. of the two rooms, one is reserved for males and the other for females. the ED also contains a triage room to measure vital signs and triage cases according to Canadian classifications. descriptive statistics were performed for all variables. the chi-square was used to assess the relationship between categorical variables. the independent t-test was used to compare group means for continuous variables. participants were informed that participation in this study was voluntary. the hospital ED contains one clinic that works 24 hours daily; however, it does not contain a triage room. 2.2.1 Sample We included all patients who presented to the ED of the above-mentioned hospitals in November 2013 regardless of whether the cases was urgent or non-urgent. the chi-square was used to assess the relationship between categorical variables. the independent t-test was used to compare group means for continuous variables. 2.6 Ethical Consideration Permission to conduct this study was granted by the ethics research committees. al-Thaghor Hospital received a significantly high number of non-urgent ER cases compared with the other two hospitals. a significantly higher proportion of non-urgent cases had experienced symptoms of one to two day\u2019s duration (P=0.001) 39 (100.0) one to two days 104 (62.3) 63 (37.7) 167 (100.0) One to two weeks 30 (50.0) 30 (50.0) 60 (100.0) Data are presented as frequency (percent) unless otherwise stated. 208 patients had not attempted to see a specialist doctor before an ER visit. 2.2%) thought the ER was the first place to visit in case of illness. 217 patients (72.3%) consulted an ER doctor first in case of illness. only 26.5% (eight non-urgent cases) were referred to an ER. most patients who visited the ER for non-urgent conditions were single, 15 years old, and had lower incomes (Table 5). most patients who visited the ER for non-urgent conditions were single, 15 years old, and had lower incomes (Table 5). 55.9% of 247 patients reported that they had the option to visit a clinic;

Table 8. Assessment of the patients\u2019 knowledge about primary healthcare centers Measuring Knowledge Frequency Percent Do you know what primary healthcare centers are. 44.9% of 136 patients who had urgent conditions reported that they did not get treatment as they expected. 156 patients complained of no organization (85.9%), followed by lack of medical staff. 93.6% of the 78 patients reported having ever left the ER without receiving treatment. 14.1% left because of the absence of a doctor. a significantly higher proportion of patients with non-urgent conditions visited the ED clinic compared with patients with urgent problems. study found 10% of all ER visits were non-urgent. it is plausible that the high percentage of non-urgent visits in this study is due to ignorance of what constitutes an emergency case and lack of a hospital policy. 60% of non-urgent ER patients judged that ER care was more convenient than that provided at their PHCC. a patient decides to seek care in an ER by consciously or unconsciously taking several factors into consideration. the most common reasons that drove patients to seek care were limited services, resources, and working hours as well as a lack of effective diagnosis at PHCCs. about 66.7% of patients without emergencies had health insurance. of the 63 patients with insurance, 57.1% had insurance by King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital, 28.6% had private insurance, and 14.3% had insurance by National Guard Hospital. findings suggest that ER staff do not discourage non-urgent ER visits. a significant high proportion of patients visited the ER three to four times a year for non-urgent conditions. a significantly higher proportion of non-urgent cases had experienced symptoms of one to two days duration prior to visiting the ER. 44.9% of 136 patients who had urgent conditions reported that not getting the treatment they expected. the emergency services at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah were over-utilized, especially at al-Thaghor hospital. a significantly high proportion of patients visited the ER three to four times a year and at least six times in one year for non-urgent cases. gent use of ERs such as not receive non-urgent cases and direct them to outpatient clinics or PHCC. develop primary care services in organizations that will assume responsibility for health status, access and coordination of services for individuals and communities."}
