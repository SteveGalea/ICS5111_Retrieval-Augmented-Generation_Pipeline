{"summary": "airway mucus layer interacts with high-speed airflow. droplets are expelled as aerosol; their concentration and size distribution may each play an important role in disease transmission. simulated cough machine exposed mucus simulants to airflow. infectious respiratory diseases are a prime cause of morbidity, mortality and health system utilization worldwide, but have a greater impact on the developing and least developed countries. infectious diseases can cause great disruptions in all sectors \u2013 economic, educational, recreational, familial \u2013 and can bring health care systems to near collapse. eight million new active cases of TB are reported annually, mostly in age-productive adults. two million people died of TB in 2002, more than in any previous year in history, becoming the leading killer of adults worldwide. close to 50% of them were fine particles, less than 2 m range, small enough to reach the alveoli within the lungs. it is important to consider the concentration of infectious particles determined by the volume of the space and its ventilation, the length of time of exposure, as well as the status of defense mechanisms of the exposed individual. fluid forms the airway surface fluid (ASF) that provides a protective milieu for the airways. the composition and physical characteristics of the ASF allow for normal ciliary activity and airway protection. 5% of mucus is water and 5% is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, salts. mucus simulants were formulated and developed to be transported within the normal range of velocity in a ciliated epithelium and cleared from a simulated cough machine. we followed the procedure described by King et al. [15]. palate was examined for macroscopic lesions, such as ulcers, petechia or redness as evidence of inflammation. only palates free of inflammatory indicators were used. humidity inside the box was maintained near 100% using a pari jet nebulizer. mucus samples were immersed in glutaraldehyde 2.5%, stored at 4\u00b0C. the epithelial tissue was carefully dissected and separated from the palate musculature. aerosol formation assay to assess the aerosol pattern formed after coughing. all fluids were placed at different distances from the \"mouth\" opening of the simulated airway. the target was a \"bullseye-type\" (circles within circles) the target was placed at a working distance of 40 cm from the mouth of the simulated airway. the samples were viewed using SEM (Hitachi S-2500) images were scanned directly to a computer and stored as image files. Sodium tetraborate (XL \"B\" or mucomodulator B, and calcium chloride, named also as XL \"C\" or mucomodulator C will be reported independently in other publications. tetraborate causes reversible crosslink formation between galactose units. we added three different volumes of 0.1 M borate to the MS to produce three levels of crosslinking. each of the gels was exposed to four cough maneuver measurements per trial. mucus simulants viscous-only were prepared dissolving different concentrations (0.5 %, 0.75 % and 1 %) of locust bean gum (LBG) in warm Ringer solution. then adding activated charcoal, bromophenol blue 1% or Coomassie blue to dye the solution for better visualization. procedure was carried out after lowering the body temperature of the frog for 30 \u2013 60 minutes inside a refrigerator to abolish pain sensations. mucus clearance was determined by observing the movement of particles of charcoal powder gently deposited on a sample of simulated mucus on the palate surface. the displacement of 3 \u2013 5 L of endogenous frog mucus sample was calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the transit time across the 0.3-inch segment marked between 0.1 and 0.4 inches in the graduated eyepiece. a volume of approximately 50 L of the sample to be studied is introduced in a reservoir. a low current is applied to the sample from a voltage supply. for every mucus sample, four measurements of the length of the thread at the moment of rupture were made. the simulated cough maneuver is repeated four times with each sputum sample. the samples were post-fixed in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution. the samples were then dehydrated by critical point drying at 31\u00b0C. tetraborate causes reversible crosslink formation between galactose units. calcium chloride increases the concentration of divalent cations in the mucus. a volume of 4 L of frog Ringer and 4 L of three different concentrations of calcium chloride were directly scanned. a paired Student-T test was applied for repeated measurements. the level of significance was set at 5 %. thread formation Non-viscous, non-elastic samples and viscous-only samples did not produce any measurable spinnability in the Filancemeter. the crosslinked MS (length of the filament) increased in a direct proportion to the volume (1.5 L, 15 L and 150 L) of 0.1 M added borate. 150 L of 0.1 M sodium tetraborate were applied. the transport velocity rate was no more than 30 percent as effective as control. a sample of approximately 0.5 mL of crosslinked MS was loaded inside the detachable portion. some portions of the MS expelled did not reach the target but landed on pieces of paper. the amount of aerosol striking the target and the amount of fine aerosol decreased progressively. the volume of XL \"B\" added to the MS sample was inversely related to the number of droplets formed after a cough maneuver and airflow interaction. cus. SE micrograph shows the \"clumping\" effect of calcium chloride applied topically to the frog palate. the ciliated surface of the palate is seen below the mucus. the frog palate is seen below the mucus and does not appear different from control views. viscous-only samples in a higher concentration range (LBG 1.0%) maintained their shape and were transported very slowly by ciliary action, approximately five times slower than control. thread formation Non-viscous, non-elastic samples and viscous-only samples did not produce any measurable spinnability. cus simulant in the frog palate was approximately 60 percent as effective as native mucus transport used as control. the transport velocity rate was no more than 30 percent (13% \u2013 30%) as effective as control. non-viscous, non-elastic MS samples were exposed to a simulated cough maneuver. some portions of the MS expelled did not reach the target but landed on pieces of paper. the amount of aerosol striking the target and the amount of fine aerosol decreased progressively with added volume of crosslinking agent. non-viscous, non-elastic properties (frog Ringer solution) were placed on the frog palate. these dispersed on the surface and were not propelled by ciliary action. the viscous-only samples did not produce any measurable spinnability in the Filancemeter. the newman-Keuls test indicated a significant difference in thread formation. the average linear velocity transport rate by ciliary action of crosslinked mucus simulant in the frog palate was approximately 60 percent as effective as native mucus transport used as control. the newman-Keuls test indicated a significant difference (p 0.01) in the weight of MS expelled from the SCM. compared low added volume (1.5 L of XL \"B\") to high volume (150 L of XL \"B\") calcium chloride effects XL \"C\" (calcium chloride 5 L) applied topically to frog palate. mucus \"clumping\" without modifying normal appearance of ciliated surface. ciliated surface of mucus is seen below the mucus. o epithelial model increases \"expectoration\" in a model system. we have obtained graphic evidence that calcium chloride increases the interaction of the ion crosslinks in the frog mucus. this action suggests that the aerosolizability of the mucus may be decreased. mucomodulators work differently than mucolytics. they disrupt structural macromolecules that give respiratory tract mucus its physical characteristics. they act to increase cohesivity of airway mucus simulants. mucomodulators may become a major consideration in treatment of cystic fibrosis. some mucomodulators increase cohesive interactions between mucin macromolecules lead to a mucus that is more easily clearable. such an improvement in mucus quality related to clearance would benefit many, if not most, patients with chronic airway disease. this novel approach might be of particular importance for those in the ICU or those with spinal cord lesions who require assisted ventilation. our low cost mucomodulators will not need to undergo constant development and reformulation due to viral or bacteria mutation or resistance. the compounds under consideration are less perishable than vaccines, amenable to distribution, and simple to manufacture to even allow for rapid response in outbreak situations.
