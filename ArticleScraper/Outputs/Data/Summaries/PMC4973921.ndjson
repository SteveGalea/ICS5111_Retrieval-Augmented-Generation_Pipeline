{"summary": "spillover from bats to humans or domestic animals remains rare. cases fatality rate from these diseases is high, and onward transmission can occur. spillover of bat viruses is often associated with discrete temporal and spatial pulses of virus excretion from the bats. within-host processes drive the third scenario, with pulses triggered by viral reactivation in persistently infected bats. a common driver among the scenarios is seasonal forcing, which occurs through birth pulses, seasonal transmission, waning maternal immunity in young, and periods of environmental or physiological stress. strategies that confront dynamics driven by transmission between hosts are likely to focus on population density, connectivity among populations, or herd immunity. strategies to address dynamics driven by within-host reactivation are likely to target pathogen biology or processes that produce stress [18]. SIR SIRS SILI Individuals have repeated pulses of excretion. no Yes Yes Virus genotype is the same in repeated pulses of excretion. research that would improve our understanding of bat virus dynamics. if most individuals recover, but a few experience SILI dynamics. current evidence for potential mechanisms has constrained understanding of within-host dynamics of emerging viruses in bats. many mechanisms that drive infectious disease dynamics in bats remain poorly characterized.

RNA was frequently detected in tissues at necropsy. the set point of interferon responses in bats appears to be relatively high compared to other mammals [45]. the latter is consistent with the possibility that bats rapidly control viral replication. there is no direct evidence that henipaviruses or filoviruses persistently infect their bat hosts. the ability of bats to control viral replication may limit the capacity of viruses such as Hendra and Nipah to spread to the central nervous system of bats. characterization of host pathogen dynamics in a spillover host does not provide evidence for the dynamics being similar in reservoir hosts. the evidence presented was weak and alternative explanations were not ruled out. the association between antibodies and Ebola viral nucleic acids in samples from bats was unclear. bat viruses have been detected in urine, feces, saliva, and soiled fruit, indicating the potential for virus transmission via excreta between bats in the wild. but under laboratory conditions, transmission for most of these viruses is difficult to achieve. RNA from Hendra virus was detected in urine and feces for an average of seven days. in three marburg virus experiments, bats experienced a short period of viremia. there were no signs of morbidity or mortality induced by Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, or Marburg viruses, consistent with previous virus detections in apparently healthy wild bats. persistent flavivirus and Rio Bravo virus infections during experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. shedding of several viruses from many individuals was observed during pulses of excretion. this observation could be explained by within-host persistence. henipaviruses or filoviruses may persist within bat hosts. recrudescent virus in humans was not transmitted and did not contribute to epidemiological dynamics. characterization of host pathogen dynamics in a spillover host does not provide evidence for the dynamics being similar in reservoir hosts. bats excreted Nipah virus in urine while neutralizing antibody was present in the serum [26]. the association between antibodies and Ebola viral nucleic acids in samples from bats is unclear. bat viruses have been detected in urine, feces, saliva, and soiled fruit. a few longitudinal serological and virological surveys have proposed that seasonal patterns in incidence or spillover could be explained by peaks of transmission in response to demographic or ecological drivers such as birth pulses, waning maternal immunity, and migration. three scenarios for pulses of viral excretion within populations are primarily driven by interactions between the processes of pathogen transmission and clearance, immunity, and host population dynamics. outbreaks of zoonotic viruses within bat populations could occur through local viral extinction and then recolonization. in the second scenario, pulses of infection are driven by transmission of short-lived infections with fluctuating host immunity. replacement of susceptible individuals from within populations also contributes to endemic persistence of pathogens in small populations. SIR, SIRS, and SILI dynamics may not be mutually exclusive. they may co-occur within or among heterogeneous populations. research methods can be combined to distinguish between these scenarios. inference from serology alone is unlikely to distinguish among our proposed epidemiological scenarios. field sampling of infection prevalence may reflect true low prevalence, low test sensitivity, or sampling of tissues in which virus does not persist. viremia or shedding in excreta may be periodic, and estimation of infection status from these samples may yield false negatives. pathogen must be detectable without lethal sampling. in a population with waning immunity, the probability that a given individual becomes infected is expected to be equal to the prevalence of infection among other individuals of similar age and the same sex. previous infection status is not expected to predict present infection status. if recapture is possible, some mechanisms may be ruled out even with incomplete time-series data. for example, SIR dynamics are unlikely in an animal in which virus is detected, not detected, and then detected again. genomics still is necessary to differentiate SIRS from SILI dynamics. different shapes represent different viral strains within a population. different colors within a shape reflect variation within strains that have a recent common ancestor. in the case of SILI dynamics, individuals remain infected over time. effective population size is expected to increase exponentially during pulses driven by reintroduction and between-host transmission. effect may dissipate if reactivated infections of a few individuals drive a more extensive outbreak with between-individual transmission. repeat sampling of individuals, although challenging and sometimes impossible, may also provide powerful insights. the prevalence of detection of viral genomes can be low. experiments should be designed to complement field sampling and sequencing of RNA viruses over space and time. it is important to reiterate that models should be revised throughout research programs. seroprevalence is a poor metric for quantifying epidemic dynamics. if antibodies persist within bats, seroprevalence measures cumulative exposure. if antibodies persist within bats, seroprevalence measures cumulative exposure. prevalence data collected across space and time may allow identification of geographic patterns that are likely to be caused by host-to-host transmission (SIR or SIRS dynamics) if the duration of maternal-derived immunity is known, the mean age of infection is a direct reflection of the basic reproductive ratio of the disease. capture-mark-recapture methods have been implemented in cave-dwelling species. if recapture is possible, generating a consistent time-series of recaptures may be challenging. some mechanisms may be ruled out even with incomplete time-series data. each pulse of reintroduced viruses is more likely to represent a different viral lineage, but reactivated viruses may be similar among pulses. the opposite pattern could be expected for pulses driven by reactivation. diverse lineages of marburg virus circulated simultaneously within and among bat colonies in Uganda across years [67] phylogenies of the virus populations across pulses are closely related. the hexagon and pentagon represent unsampled viral diversity present in the population. the hexagon and pentagon represent unsampled viral diversity present in the population. in pulses of reintroduced viruses, the individual viruses sampled at different points in time might be paraphyletic. reactivated viruses are expected to be monophyletic, with differences among pulses attributable to within-host evolution. viral sequence data may therefore help to distinguish the mechanisms driving pulses of viral infection in bats. zing infections and metapopulation dynamics contribute to population-level maintenance. zing infections and

within reservoir hosts makes understanding, predicting, and managing zoonoses very challenging. distinguishing among mechanisms driving disease dynamics in reservoir hosts may be critical for developing public health interventions. each scenario involves different underlying mechanisms, yet can produce similar patterns in prevalence data. marburg virus circulation in juvenile Rousettus
