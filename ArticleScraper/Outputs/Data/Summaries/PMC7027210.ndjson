{"summary": "data on grants for biomedical research by 10 major funders of health research were collected from the world RePORT platform. the analysis explores the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaboration between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. this will not only improve efficiency and equity in allocating scarce resources but will also allow informed investment decisions that aim to support research on public health needs."}
