{"summary": "a point-prevalence survey conducted in 199 hospitals in 2015 found that pneumonia was the most frequent healthcare-associated infection in the united states. a prevalence of healthcare-associated infections between 6 and 16%, with HAP responsible for 13\u201318% of the total infections (5\u20137). in adults, respiratory viruses have been reported in 22% of cases of HAP (21). ez Children's Hospital of Mexico registers more than 7,000 hospitalizations per year. it has 349 beds, 2 ICUs, one neonatal ICU and registers more than 7,000 hospitalizations per year. a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. patients were divided into two groups according to the results of the nasopharyngeal sample. patients in whom at least one respiratory virus was detected were included in the NVHAP group. patients in whom no respiratory virus was detected were included in the NVHAP group. the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical variables. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the most frequent diagnoses were malignant neoplasms (30%), congenital heart disease (28%) and malformations of the genitourinary tract (11%). a single viral pathogen was detected in 53.9% of cases. patients with VAHAP were slightly younger [median age 21 (IQR 6\u201390) vs. 37 (IQR 5\u2013126) months] and were more likely to have leukopenia (16.8 vs. 4.8%) than those with NVHAP. 22.7) 13 (31.7) 0.45c Congenital heart disease** 8 (36.4) 10 (24.4) 0.31c Genitourinary tract disease 3 (13.6) 4 (9.8) 0.68b Chronic respiratory illness 1 (4.5) 3 (7.3) 1b Other comorbidities** 2 (9.5) 9 (22.0) 0.30b VAP** 4 (18.2) 2 (4.9) 0.45a * Median and IQR. 19 (10\u201336) 0.48a Monocytes %* 5 (3\u20138) 5 (3\u20139) 0.52a Platelets/mm3* 164,000 (127,250\u2013333,000) 231,000 (140,500\u2013362,000) 0.88a Positive cultures** 7 (8.7%) 8 (8.9%) 0.29a Blood cultures** 4 (26.6%) 4 (21.05%) 0.42b * Median and IQR. two thirds of patients in the NVHAP and almost half in the VAHAP group required mechanical ventilation. the 30-day mortality rate did not show a significant difference between groups, nor did the risk for death differ between groups. at least one respiratory virus was identified in 20% of pediatric patients with nosocomial pneumonia (24) the higher frequency of respiratory viruses found in our study could be due to the systematic active surveillance of nosocomial pneumonia. the median length of stay at the time of onset of pneumonia was shorter in patients with VAHAP than among those with NVHAP. more than a third of adults (34%) with HAP that required admission to intensive therapy presented at least one type of respiratory virus. the outcomes were similar between patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia. however, our study was not powered to find differences in outcomes between groups. sensitivity to bacteria, are scarcely performed because they are considered invasive and not essential for patient care. more studies with the routine use of PCT or other markers of bacterial infections are needed. more studies with the routine use of PCT or other markers of bacterial infections are needed. the protocol was approved by the committees of research, ethics and biosafety of the Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez. MT-G, BP, VR, and DR-Z contributed to the analysis and/or interpretation of data."}
