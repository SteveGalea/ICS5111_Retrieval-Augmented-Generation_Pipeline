{"summary": "arab exporters declared an embargo on shipments to western countries on October 17, 1973. the crisis challenged the US's position in the world, polarized its politics at home, and shook the country's confidence. the crisis produced the birth of the modern era of energy. in 1973, most oil was consumed in developed economies of North America, western Europe, and Japan. in 2012 the standards were raised to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. the crisis also set the stage for the emergence of new importers. in the late 1990s, the Canadian oil sands embarked on an era of growth. most recent is the development of \u201ctight oil,\u201d the spinoff from shale gas. this boom in domestic output has increased the energy supply, and combined with shale gas has had a wider economic impact. calamities will convulse the globe, possibly leading to unlivable cities, widespread famine, civil unrest, wars over dwindling resources, the extinction of at least half the species on Earth, the death of the oceans from growing acidity. a severe storm front had been building 800 miles to the north along the Canadian border, producing blizzards with gale-force wind. black wall of soil >10,000 feet high, containing 300,000 tons of dirt and generating enough static electricity to power New York City. black Sunday, the occasion of the worst dust storm in american history, provides a grim snapshot of the devastation of the 1930s Dust Bowl and what happens when the weather goes haywire in a landscape that has been drastically altered by human development. inflated grain prices triggered a land boom that resulted in the plowing of >100 million acres, from a relatively scant 12 million acres a few decades before. the prairie was a beacon of prosperity in an America that would be ravaged by economic calamity by the 1929 stock market crash, which led to the Great Depression. by 1935, inhabitants began to abandon the Plains in what became the largest mass migration in US history. 7000 people suffocated from the dust and thousands more were permanently incapacitated. the midsection of the u.s. will be gripped by extreme droughts and baked by 90\u00b0F days for more than half the year. by the end of this century we can expect the midsection of the u.s. to be gripped by extreme droughts. wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour and lasting >6 hours cut off electrical power to nearly 4 million people for up to a week. the heat also contributed to the record-breaking drought that engulfed 80% of the continental US by mid July. at the end of October 2012 came hurricane Sandy, which has been described as \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d carbon dioxide is considered a \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d because it creates a hothouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation from the sun, inhibiting the planet's natural cooling mechanisms. carbon dioxide is considered a \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d because it creates a hothouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation from the sun, inhibiting the planet's natural cooling mechanisms. the last 2 decades of the 20th century were the hottest in 400 years and perhaps the warmest in several millennia. rapid ocean acidification, which increased by 30% in the past century, is another tipoff. rising CO2 emissions are fueling the growing acidity of the oceans, which is killing seafood species, coral reefs, and organisms. we are on the threshold of transformative changes in the weather. a pervasive and falsely comforting belief that climate change will happen slowly, that the globe will heat up uniformly, and that the predicted devastation will not occur until long after the baby boomer generation has died of old age. winters are shorter and warmer than they were 30 years ago. temperatures will continue to climb because of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide. over the next century the thermostat will climb another 2\u00b0F to 11\u00b0F. enheit rise is at the outer edge of what we may be able to manage. many scientists now believe we are on the tipping point that could unleash unstoppable forces. melting permafrost in siberia could belch millions of tons of methane in the atmosphere. up to 5 million deaths occur each year from air pollution, hunger, and disease as a result of climate change and emissions from carbon-intensive economies. the incidence of dengue fever, long thought eradicated in the USA and once close to being wiped out in South America, is now climbing in the western hemisphere. the number of people hospitalized in the USA with it tripled between 2000 and 2007. heat and suffocating haze doubled the death rate to an average of 700 a day and >52,000 people overall. cities will feel the heat more acutely because of their high concentration of asphalt, buildings, and pavement. urban heat islands could become uninhabitable hot zones for months at a stretch, triggering the deaths of thousands. the incidence of coccidioidomycosis has quadrupled in the drought-stricken southwest. in the past decade, the incidence of this illness has quadrupled in the drought-stricken southwest. sociological trends also will exacerbate the spread of disease as the planet heats up."}
