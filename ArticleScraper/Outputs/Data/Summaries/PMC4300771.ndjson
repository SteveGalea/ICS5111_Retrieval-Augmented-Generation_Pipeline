{"summary": "vaccinia virus (VACV) was used to eradicate smallpox worldwide. little is known about the origins of the virus or the many strains produced over more than a century of its propagation. recombination and selection for essential genes near the telomeres of a horse pox-like ancestor likely drove VACV evolution and diversification. equine influenza viruses (EIVs) of the H3N8 subtype have crossed the species barrier to infect several mammalian species, prompting concerns about their potential to infect humans. the vaccine is immunogenic, and a single dose protects mice and ferrets from challenge with different EIV strains. coronavirus pathogenesis is determinant of coronavirus pathogenesis. new target for antiviral therapeutics."}
