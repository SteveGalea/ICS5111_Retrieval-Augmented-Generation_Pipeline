{"summary": "neonatal neuro-developmental follow up (NNFU) clinic staff mailed ASQ to 27 families during SARS. the gestational age, sex, entry diagnosis and age at the clinic visit was not different between the groups. criteria used to identify infants at risk selected for either mailed ASQ or phone interviews were not clearly defined. NNFU clinics were designed for effective monitoring and assessment of these infants at regular time intervals. despite efforts made to accommodate care givers there is still a significant number of missed appointments and loss to follow up at most neonatal follow up clinics. high risk preterm and full term infants are regularly scheduled for neuro-developmental assessment in our NNFU clinic. as a consequence of SARS all outpatient clinics were closed. a decision was made to use a mailed questionnaire and a telephone interview rather than the standard face to face patient assessment. the corresponding time period was defined as April to May 2003. the non-SARS group assessments were matched for the corresponding time periods in 2005. a developmental delay was defined as testing below the cutoff in any domain. study population Infants were identified as eligible for neuro-developmental follow up in our program if either preterm (27 weeks gestation) or having other pre or post natal risk factors for adverse neuro-developmental outcome. non-SARS group infants had planned appointments in the corresponding time period of April and May 2003. data analysis and statistical tests Data were analyzed to compare the rate of reported developmental delay as well as the rate of referral for further testing. the rate of new diagnoses communicated with a family was also compared. the ASQ was mailed to 27 infants' families during the SARS period. seventeen families returned the questionnaire and eight had a telephone interview. criteria used to identify infants at risk selected for either mailed ASQ or phone interviews were not clearly defined. \"during\" visit 18% (3/17)* 45% (45/99)* 12% (2/17) 26% (26/99) \"after\" visit 53% (39/73) 46% (43/94) 32% (23/73) 33% (31/94) data expressed as percentage (absolute number) *p 0.05 Rate of referral for therapy/further testing. there were no significant differences between groups for demographics or reason for NNFU enrollment. n = 95 n = 99 Gestational Age (weeks) 32.1 5.1 32.7 5.6 Birth Weight (grams) 1885 1145 1980 1138 Male Sex 54 (56.8%) 51 (51.5%) Preterm 58 (61%) 49 (49.5%) PPHN 13 (13.7%) 14 (14.1%) HIE 8 (8.4%) 11 (11.1%) IUGR 5 (5.2%) 8 (8%) of the 14 infants with a normal ASQ, only two were confirmed by face to face assessment. the rate of identification of developmental delay was significantly lower during SARS. the rate of identification of developmental delay was not significantly different between the SARS group and non-SARS group. none of the newly diagnosed children with cerebral palsy or autism in the after visit had been evaluated during the SARS period. the follow up team was able to identify new diagnoses among the non-SARS group throughout the three visits using direct face to face assessment. data for 73 infants were available following SARS (after visit) representing a 24% loss to follow up rate over the three visits compared to 5% (5/99) for non-SARS group over the same period. the validity of using the parent completed ASQ system as an alternative approach to evaluate developmental outcome has been extensively evaluated [19-22] some literature has suggested that parents may be unable to complete questionnaires satisfactorily due to reading, organizational, mental health and cognitive disabilities. well planned mail and telephone contact may be of assistance in providing patient care during the time of infectious disease containment measures. such contact may also help with maintaining the engagement of families and return to clinic. consideration should be given for remuneration of physician and other health care providers."}
