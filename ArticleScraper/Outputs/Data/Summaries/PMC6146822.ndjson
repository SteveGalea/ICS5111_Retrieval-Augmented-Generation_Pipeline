{"summary": "furin is a proprotein convertase responsible for maturation of a huge number of inactive proteins. it is localized in the trans-Golgi network, from which it is cycled to the cell surface and the endosomes. furin is a proprotein convertase responsible for maturation of a huge number of inactive proteins. dec-RVKR-CMK and a proprotein convertase inhibitor are often used in virology experiments. they show that enzymatic processing during biogenesis of the MERS-CoV S protein by proprotein convertases such as furin is not required for infectivity. however, they stated that the host cell protease is required for S protein activation during viral uptake into target cells. reexamined the role of furin during MERS-CoV infection to clarify when and how it is involved in virus cell entry. findings raise questions about our current understanding of host protease usage underlying MERS-CoV infection. the relationship between inoculated virus titer (x axis) and data values for each assay (y axis) is shown. the amount of viral mRNA in cells at 6 h postinfection was measured by real-time PCR. a two-tailed Student t test was used to analyze statistical significance. to evaluate the suitability of the assays for the furin inhibition experiments, we examined the effect of a furin inhibitor (dec-RVKR-CMK; 100 M) on viral entry into cells. TMPRSS2 inhibitor suppressed virus entry 100-fold. similar results were obtained after treatment with 20 M dec-RVKR-CMK. either furin is essential for S protein activation or dec-RVKR-CMK suppresses both furin and TMPRSS2. coding proteins involved in cell entry by MERS-CoV. unlike Calu-3 and Huh-7 cells, LoVo cells expressed DPP4, furin, cathepsin L, and TMPRSS2. furin expression was highest in Huh-7 cells. a two-tailed Student t test was used to analyze statistical significance. entry of MERS-CoV into furin-deficient LoVo cells was suppressed. treatment with 100 M dec-RVKR-CMK completely suppressed entry. Western blot analysis of S proteins harboring mutations at R748 (R748S or R748S/R884S) detected no 80-kDa cleavage product on virions. the S proteins of wt and R884 mutant viruses in Vero/TMPRSS2 and Huh-7 cells were cleaved. protein lacks furin cleavage sites. entry of furin-deficient cells by virus lacking furin cleavage sites blocked. molecule targeted by dec-RVKR-CMK during MERS-CoV entry is not furin. exogenous furin does not activate the S protein. furin tested it using a furin substrate, BOC-RVRR-AMC. treatment with exogenous trypsin, but not exogenous furin. the enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin was confirmed using the fluorescent substrate BOC-RVRR-AMC. exogenous furin does not trigger cell entry by virus. dec-RVKR-CMK, camostat, and E64d did not. this suggests that dec-RVKR-CMK has no effect on endocytosis. cellular RNA was isolated 6 h after infection. dec-RVKR-CMK (100 M), camostat (10 M) plus E64d (10 M), or lopinavir (30 M) was added to LoVo cells (for 30 min on ice) at the indicated times before and after MERS-CoV inoculation. neither E64d nor bafilomycin A1 suppressed the activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase. degradation products of fluorescein-labeled casein generated by treatment with commercial proteases were quantified by fluorometry. data are expressed as average percentages relative to that in the absence of dec-RVKR-CMK. dec-RVKR-CMK inhibitor suppressed cell-cell fusion completely. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of the inhibitor. after 5 h, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. luciferase (Luc) gene (VSV-G/Luc-MERS-S) and (iii) authentic MERS-CoV were used to infect vero/TMPRSS2 cells (18), which are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV. entry of these viruses into cells was measured using appropriate assays. effect of dec-RVKR-CMK on cell entry by authentic MERS-CoV. cells were inoculated with 103 infectious units of VSV-G/GFP-MERS-S (MOI = 0.1) Luciferase activity in cells was measured at 20 h postinfection (n = 4) pseudotyped virus encoding GFP is suitable for measuring the percent infection within a narrow range. the quantifiable range for this virus was 4 logs, and the luminometer used in the assay has a dynamic range of 9 logs. a furin inhibitor suppressed virus entry 100-fold. ERS-CoV entry into bronchial epithelial cells was used as a comparison control. the cells were infected with 105 PFU of MERS-CoV (MOI = 1). the amount of viral mRNA in Calu-3 cells was measured by real-time PCR. expression of mRNA in Calu-3, LoVo, and Huh-7 cells was evaluated using real-time PCR. ND, no transcripts were detected. mRNAs isolated from Calu-3 and LoVo cells were reverse transcribed. effects of furin inhibitor on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV entry. cells were pretreated for 30 min with the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK. dec-RVKR-CMK (concentration, 0 to 100 M), camostat (10 M), or a combination of both was used as a comparison control. wt and mutant viruses in vero/TMPRSS2 and Huh-7 cells were cleaved. however, none of the S proteins were cleaved in LoVo cells. this confirmed that LoVo cells lack furin activity and that the mutation in S protein lies within the furin cleavage site. wt and mutant viruses shown in panel A were used to infect Vero/TMPRSS2, Huh-7, and LoVo cells. cell lysates prepared at 20 h postinfection were subjected to Western blot analysis. furin does not activate the MERS-CoV S protein. cleaved S protein (80 kDa) in non-protease-treated viruses propagated in vero/TMPRSS2 cells. no 80-kDa S protein was detected when cells were treated with exogenous furin. the 150-kDa and 50-kDa products were detected. dec-RVKR-CMK targets the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. we examined the effect of dec-RVKR-CMK on endocytosis. dec-RVKR-CMK and E64d/camostat showed inhibitory effects within 30 min after infection. addition of lopinavir at 2 h postinfection still inhibited viral RNA replication. a fluorescent protease assay kit measures degradation products of fluorescein-labeled casein. the kit was unable to detect furin activity because casein does not contain the furin cleavage site. a high concentration (100 M) of dec-RVKR-CMK completely suppressed the activities of cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, and papain. dec-RVKR-CMK inhibits commercial proteases. a high titer of MERS-CoV (MOI = 10) was adsorbed onto vero/TMPRSS2 or vero cells. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of the inhibitor. cell-cell fusion was first observed at 3 h after warming. the dec-RVKR-CMK inhibitor (100 M) suppressed cell-cell fusion completely. the results strongly suggest that dec-RVKR-CMK targets cell surface TMPRSS2. studies show that TMPRSS2 activates the MERS-CoV S protein (4, 10, 27) expression of TMPRSS2 at the cell surface induces virus entry into cells and cell-cell fusion of S protein-expressing cells (4, 10, 27) this phenomenon is suppressed by protease inhibitors camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate. park et al. report that the only role played by furin during MERS-CoV infection is to determine the cell tropism of the virus (8). the only role played by furin during infection is to determine the cell tropism of the virus. the titer of VSV-pseudotyped viruses was determined in vero cells. cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit. a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone was used to generate recombinant MERS-CoV (22) the culture supernatants were inoculated onto a 10-cm dish (VIOLAMO) containing Huh-7 cells. infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 or 4 days until a cytopathic effect was observed. a real-time PCR assay was performed to quantify expression of mRNAs encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), dPP4, furin, cathepsin L, TMPRSS2 and HAT. recombinant human furin (P8077; New England BioLabs, UK) was mixed with 100 M furin substrate (boc-RVRR-AMC; I-1645; samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (e-PAGEL; ATTO, Japan), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, USA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. western blot analysis was carried out using an anti-S2 antibody and anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2054; Santa Cruz Biotech, USA) the activities of the proteases listed above were quantified using a fluorescent protease assay kit (23266; Pierce, USA) to measure the activity of neutral pH-dependent proteases. experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. titer of VSV-pseudotyped viruses was determined in vero cells. titer of VSV-pseudotyped viruses was determined in vero cells. titer of VSV-pseudotyped viruses was determined in vero cells. a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone was used to generate recombinant MERS-CoV (22). a bacterial artificial chromosome (termed pBAC-MERS-wt) was used to generate recombinant MERS-CoV. a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone was used to generate recombinant. the following proteases were used: cathepsin L (16-12-030112;
