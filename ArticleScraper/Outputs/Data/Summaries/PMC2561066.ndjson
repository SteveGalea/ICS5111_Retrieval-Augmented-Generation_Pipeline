{"summary": "wild common shrews (Sorex araneus) produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span. this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. we predicted adult shrews would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. immune system is the primary mechanism through which animals defend against parasites and pathogenic organisms. maintenance and up-regulation of the immune system requires energy and nutritional resources [1], resulting in a trade-off between investment in immunity and other physiological processes, including growth and reproduction. a number of studies of ecological immunology in birds and insects have. been little effort to understand immune function of small mammals in this context outside the laboratory. shrews have a fast metabolic rate even for their small body size [31] but store very little energy as fat [32] lack of resources may therefore limit the capacity of S. araneus to mount immunological responses. to date, there have been no studies of spleen or bone marrow function in S. araneus. shrews are capable of mounting immune/inflammatory responses throughout their life span. some degree of lymphatic exhaustion was obvious in adult animals. shrews were classified into three age categories: 18 sub\u2013adults. enean parasites in both tissues counted and identified using keys. helminths and guts were removed, weighed, stored in 10% formalin. helminths were identified as nematodes, cestodes or digeneans. peroxidase anti-peroxidase and avidin biotin peroxidase complex methods were used to identify leukocytes and proliferating cells in the common shrew. cells identified antibody Detection method; pre-treatment B cells Rat anti-mouse CD45Ra ABCi; citrate buffer pre-treatment B cells Mouse anti-human CD79ac ABC. proliferating cells were identified by their expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. apoptotic cells were demonstrated in situ by the ase complex method. proliferating cells were present in follicle germinal centres, splenic red pulp and sinuses of the pancreas of Aselli. a proportion of cells with the morphology of neutrophils were negative for both antigens. apoptotic cells were present in follicle germinal centres, T cell zones, bone marrow and splenic red pulp. shrews were classified into three age categories: 18 sub-adults, showing no sign of sexual development (11 female, 7 male), 3 animals undergoing sexual maturation (2 female, 1 male) and 22 sexually mature animals (11 female and 11 male) caught during or after the breeding season. all animals appeared healthy when captured, and were killed humanely by overdose of inhalation anaesthetic. nematodes, cestodes or digeneans were removed, weighed, stored in 10% formalin. helminths were identified as nematodes, cestodes or digeneans. sections (5 m) were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (cross) reacting in other species were used in conjunction with peroxidase anti-peroxidase and avidin biotin peroxidase complex methods. antibodies and detection methods used to identify leukocytes and proliferating cells in the common shrew with references to suppliers and use in other species. cellular turnover in haemolymphatic tissues was assessed by counting proliferating cells. proliferating cells were identified by their expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. apoptotic cells were demonstrated in situ by the TUNEL method. myelomonocytic cells were expressed by monocytes and macrophages. a proportion of cells with the morphology of neutrophils were negative for both antigens. apoptotic cells were present in follicle germinal centres, splenic red pulp and sinuses of the pancreas of Aselli. the degree of inflammatory infiltration in the liver was assessed semi-quantitatively as mild, moderate or severe. spleen in adult shrews exhibits lesser activity in the white pulp but higher cellularity in the red pulp compared to the spleen in sub-adults Red and white pulp of shrews of all age groups were examined. red pulp exhibited some degree of cellular turnover, with approximately 10% proliferating, PCNA-positive cells and scattered apoptotic cells. in general, 30\u201350% of cells in the red pulp were positive for myeloid/histiocyte antigen and lysozyme. the white pulp of sub-adults was exclusively comprised of secondary follicles, which often appeared interconnected and formed large groups. the majority of adults exhibited fewer follicles which were a mixture of primary and secondary follicles. the difference between adults and sub-adults was not statistically significant. males (n = 18) and females (n = 21) did not differ with respect to either size (Wald = 0.67, ns) or depletion (Wald = 0.13, ns) of follicles in the spleen of common shrews. levels of follicle depletion was categorized as none, mild, or moderate. the composition of the pancreas of Aselli was very similar to that of a lymph node. in four adult shrews, the marginal sinuses exhibited focal to extensive fibrosis. the sinuses lay a cortex containing exclusively secondary follicles. the pancreas of Aselli exhibits features very similar to a lymph node. the cortex is reduced to a single, secondary follicle (F) and the medulla (M) is expanded and focally extends into the cortex. panel C. The B cell marker CD79a is weakly expressed in the germinal centre dark zone (GC), but expressed by B cells in the light zone and follicle mantle zone (arrows). ollicles in the pancreas of Aselli were classified as primary or secondary. levels of follicle depletion was categorized as none, mild, moderate or severe. levels of follicle depletion was categorized as none, mild, moderate or severe. extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in 9/21 (43%) adult animals. the whole organ frequently appeared as an accumulation of plasma cells. the medulla often occupied most of the organ in adult animals. nematodes (Liniscus incrassatus; Roots, 1992) recovered from the lumen and between epithelial cells of the urinary bladder were associated with mild to moderate acute to chronic lymphocytic submucosal infiltration in one of two animals infected. se Liver Nematodese and protozoan cystse Myocardium Protozoan cystse Oesophagus Digenean (Brachylaemus fulvus c) and protozoan cystse Skeletal muscle protozoan cystse Spleen protozoan cystse Urinary bladder Nematodes (Liniscus incrassatus c) and protozoan cystse a most likely Por a high proportion of shrews (14/18 sub-adults; 78%, 2/3 pubescent animals; 67%, 12/22 adults; 55%) exhibited protozoan parasites within vessel walls that could not be further identified. these occurred predominantly in kidneys (21/43 shrews; 49%), but also occasionally in the liver, the splenic red pulp, the medulla of the pancreas of Aselli and the urinary bladder. five of the 43 animals exhibited granulomas within the pancreas of Aselli. the spleen in adult shrews exhibits lesser activity in the white pulp but higher cellularity in the red pulp compared to the spleen in sub-adults. red pulp exhibited some degree of cellular turnover, with approximately 10% proliferating, PCNA-positive cells and scattered apoptotic cells. 30\u201350% of cells in the red pulp were positive for myeloid/histiocyte antigen (Fig. 1D) and lysozyme. the white pulp of sub-adults was exclusively comprised of secondary follicles. these follicles were for the most part large and without signs of depletion. the majority of adults showed fewer follicles which were a mixture of primary and secondary follicles. follicles in the spleen were classified as primary or secondary, and their size recorded as small, medium, or large. level of follicle depletion was categorized as none, mild, or moderate on the basis of the cellularity of the germinal centres. the pancreas of Aselli was very similar to that of a lymph node. in four adult shrews, the marginal sinuses exhibited focal to extensive fibrosis. in four adult shrews, the marginal sinuses exhibited focal to extensive fibrosis. the cortex is reduced to a single, secondary follicle (F) and the medulla (M) is expanded and focally extends into the cortex (arrow). panel C. The B cell marker CD79a is weakly expressed in the germinal centre dark zone (GC), but expressed by B cells in the light zone and follicle mantle zone (arrows). level of follicle depletion was categorized as none, mild, moderate or severe. bar height indicates percentage of sub-adult (open bars, n = 18) and adult (filled bars, n = 21) shrews within each category (x axis) extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in 9/21 (43%) adult animals. the whole organ frequently appeared as an accumulation of plasma cells. this was not seen in sub-adult animals. nematodes (Liniscus incrassatus; Roots, 1992) recovered from the lumen and between epithelial cells of the urinary bladder were associated with mild to moderate acute to chronic lymphocytic submucosal infiltration. nematode larvae (Eucoleus oesophagicola c) and protozoan cystse Spleen protozoan cystse Stomach Digenea (Brachylaemus fulvus c), nematodes (including Eucoleus kutori c) and protozoan cystse Urinary bladder Nematodes (Liniscus incrassatus c) and protozoan cysts protozoan cysts with features of Sarcocystis sp. were found within skeletal muscle myocytes of one adult female, without any associated reaction. no difference in severity of the inflammatory infiltration was apparent between sub-adults (n = 18) and adults (n = 22; Wald = 0.03, ns), or between males (n = 22) and females (n = 18; Wald = 0.03, ns) the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and bone marrow in s. araneus were found to be very similar to their equivalents in other mammalian species. the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and bone marrow were found to be very similar to their equivalents in other mammalian species. the pancreas of Aselli in S. araneus is not a specific site of exclusive B cell production nor a functional analogue of the bursa of Fabricius in birds. however, it differs from normal lymph nodes in that the centre contains a very high proportion of plasma cells. in adulthood, the number of plasma cells and the relative size of the medulla seem to increase. in humans it has been shown to be a product of defective T cell-dependent B cell activation. reduced lymphocyte production as a consequence of follicular and T cell impairment could explain why significantly lower numbers of white blood cells have been reported in old common shrews. differences between sub-adults and adults were also evident in the so-called \u201cmarginal\u201d or \u201cintermediate zone\u201d of the spleen. the rate of thymic involution is known to vary between species and breeds. thymic involution is delayed to maintain production of T cells into adulthood. it has been suggested that short-lived species should limit investment in immunity to immediate, innate responses. plasma cells are long-lived and can survive for weeks after immunisation. young common shrews invest in long term immunity by producing and storing plasma cells in the pancreas of Aselli. this strategy may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites."}
