{"summary": "apoD, a 29 kDa glycoprotein, is a member of the lipocalin super family. it transports several small hydrophobic compounds such as arachidonic acid (AA), progesterone, pregnenolone, bilirubin, cholesterol and E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid. in human, apoD is found in the plasma fraction, associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) it is highly expressed in PPAR regulates positively its own transcription and induces transcription of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), which in turn activates PPAR gene expression. many natural PPAR ligands have been discovered including AA, prostaglandins, oxidized fatty acid (FA) and some polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) lipoatrophic mice develop hepatic steatosis through over-expression. inhibition of PPAR expression reduces hepatic steatosis. lipogenesis is regulated at various levels. AA concentration is enriched in liver and decreased in plasma. our work reveals novel mechanism of apoD action in lipid metabolism. antibody against mouse apoD was purchased from Abcam. collagenase type I was acquired from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ) collagenase type I was acquired from aston villa. the animals were housed at 24 1\u00b0C in a 12h light dark cycle. 1x106 cells were seeded on collagen-pretreated plates (Corning Costar) in DMEM/F12 media containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. next day, culture media was removed and renewed with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing the same antibiotics. immunoblotting Tissues or cultured cells were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and 10% Complete protease inhibitor) lymphs were then incubated 30 min at 4\u00b0C, cleared by centrifugation and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further use. 96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with purified human apoD standards. samples were diluted in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.5 to a final volume of 100 L. coated wells were blocked with 3% BSA for 1h at RT. Lysates were then incubated 30 min at 4\u00b0C, cleared by centrifugation and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. the concentration of PGE2 was then measured using a specific immunoassay (Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-900-001) fatty acid specific radioactivity was expressed as cpm/g of liver and counted. 3H-oleate fatty acid uptake Primary hepatocytes from WT and Tg mice were cultured in serum free media for 48h. radioactivity was measured using 3H-oleate as previously described. plasma and liver FA were analyzed as their fatty acid methyl derivatives (FAME) after direct transesterification with acetyl chloride/methanol. injections (2 L for plasma and 1 L for liver samples) were performed on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph. ase-conjugated secondary antibody, luciferin and propidium iodure were obtained from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) anti-PPAR (C26H12), anti-AMPK, anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172)(40H9), HPRT and -actin antibodies were from Cell signaling (cell signaling technology, Danvers, MA, USA) anti-ACC and anti-phospho-ACC (Ser79) primary hepatocytes isolated by in situ liver perfusion and collagenase digestion. mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. liver was perfused with perfusion buffer (10 mM HEPES, 142mM NaCl, 6,7mM KCl; pH 7,85) luciferase reporter plasmid containing five PPAR response elements. cells were incubated 48h with 7M of AA bound to BSA. RNA extraction and semi-quantitative RT-PCR Tissues were collected. primary antibodies were detected with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish perioxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. primary antibodies were then detected with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish perioxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000) peroxidase substrate TMB (3,3\u2019, 5,5\u2019-Tetramethylbenzidine) solution (100 L, Fitzgerald, MA, USA) was applied to each well for 30 min. reaction was stopped by adding 50 L of 1M phosphoric acid. plasma was isolated by centrifugation (2000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C) lipogenesis 1-year-old mice fed ad libitum were injected intraperitoneally with 7 Ci of 3H2O. one-hour post-injection, animals were sacrificed and the blood and liver were collected. plasma and liver FA were analyzed as their fatty acid methyl derivatives (FAME) after direct transesterification with acetyl chloride/methanol. plasma and liver FA were analyzed as their fatty acid methyl derivatives (FAME) after direct transesterification with acetyl chloride/methanol. the concentration of arachidonic acid was calculated using a mix of internal and external labelled standards added to liver and plasma samples. the concentration of arachidonic acid is reported as absolute concentration (M or nmol/mg tissue) and relative to total fatty acid content (%) PPAR1 was increased by 2.24-fold in Tg mice. expression of C/EBP mRNA, early marker of adipogenic-like phenotype was also increased. expression of PPAR target gene Plin2 [51] was increased by 1.98-fold in Tg mice. d independent gene of PPAR regulation, Cide B remained unchanged. the expression of genes coding for several lipases remained identical. however, the size of the hepatic LD in H-apoD Tg mice was drastically increased (5.45-fold) compared to WT. circulating FFA, cholesterol and TG concentrations were not different between H-apoD Tg and WT mice [15]. mRNA expression of two enzymes implicated in lipoprotein metabolism, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) remained also unaffected in Tg mice. in contrast, the expression of CD36, a target of PPAR and the main transporter of hepatic FFA in cells, was significantly increased AMPK expression was increased by 1.82-fold in the liver of Tg mice. phosphorylation on Thr172 residue was also increased (2.63 fold) but the AMPK activity was unaffected as evaluated by the ratio of P-AMP/AMPK. PPAR mRNA was increased in H-apoD Tg mice liver suggesting an elevated hepatic lipid -oxidation. mRNA expression of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I was slightly increased (1.26-fold) in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice compared to WT. RT-PCR analysis of PGC-1 (B) and CPT1 (C) expression in liver of WT and H-apoD Tg mice. for each graph, the H-apoD Tg values were normalized by the WT values and are the means SD of 4 mice per group. a combination of AA and apoD over-expression showed a very strong synergistic transactivation effect on PPAR transcriptional activity. a- HepG2 cells were either non transfected (NT) or transfected with a myc-Tag apoD-cDNA or empty vector (EV) construct. plasmatic and hepatic AA is significantly decreased in the plasma of H-apoD Tg compared to WT mice. however, the prostaglandin E2 concentration is similar between WT and H-apoD. a significant mRNA expression was detected in both plasma and liver. the hepatic H-apoD protein can originate either from an endogenous hepatic expression or from a selective blood uptake. both PPAR1 and 2 mRNA levels are increased (1.37-fold and 1.16-fold Tg vs WT respectively) expression level of key proteins involved in LD formation increased by 1.98-fold. expression of PPAR target gene Plin2 [51] increased by 1.98-fold in Tg mice. expression of PPAR target gene Plin2 [51] increased by 1.98-fold. the graph represents the level of Plin2 protein expression standardized by amidoblack staining. values are expressed relatively to the WT mice and are the means SD of 4 mice per group. ate showed a 30% increase in oleate uptake in Tg mice. this confirms that the upregulation of CD36 provides a functional role in those mice. mRNA expression of ACC, SCD1, DGAT and LXR remained unaffected in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice compared to WT. Western blot analysis of total and phospho-AMPK (A), total and phospho-ACC (B) and FAS (C) protein expression in the liver of WT and H-apoD Tg mice. PPAR is known to regulate the expression of genes involved in the -oxidation pathway. however, the mRNA expression of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1) was slightly increased (1.26-fold) in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice compared to WT. cells were transfected with a construct containing the cDNA of human apoD. no apoD was detected in cells either untransfected or transfected with an empty vector. cells were incubated with 7 M of AA in presence or absence of apoD. PPAR, -galactosidase and with either an empty vector or a myc-Tag apoD-cDNA construct. cells were treated with 7 M AA for 4h. apoD activity represents data normalized by -galactosidase activity. hepatic steatosis is a result of an increased AA by apoD in the liver. this leads to PPAR transcriptional activation and downstream effects such as the mild metabolic syndrome and associated insulin resistance. apoD interacts with the leptin receptor regulating the hypothalamic function in energy control. it is unlikely that our observations are due to an insertion of the apoD transgene in a genomic area disrupting the metabolism. this argues for a direct effect of apoD in the liver rather than a role in hypothalamus. in vitro studies strongly suggest that apoD acts as an AA transporter. AA is the preferential ligand of apoD [3] and a precursor for prostaglandins which are also natural PPAR activators [22,23] the upregulation of C/EBP expression is minor. this could be explained by the fact that the hepatic steatosis progression in Tg mice is very slow and hence, the genes implicated are expected to be only slightly modulated. hepatic PPAR mRNA is increased in H-apoD Tg mice liver [15] we measured the mRNA levels of key lipogenic enzymes including LXR. we did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of ACC, SCD1, DGAT and LXR. we also observed an elevation of AMPK expression. ACC in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice is associated with an increased expression of CPT-1 strongly suggesting an activation of the -oxidation. however, this increased expression does not appear sufficient to reverse the progression of the hepatic steatosis in the H-apoD Tg mice. Western blot analyses of plasma (P) and liver (L) in WT and Tg mice. A polyclonal mouse antibody was used to detect the endogenous apoD protein."}
