{"summary": "a 69-year-old Caucasian man and a 71-year-old Caucasian woman presented in 2009 with coexisting H1N1 virus and Legionella infections. in our cases all the signs and symptoms, including vomiting, progressive respiratory disease leading to respiratory failure, refractory hypoxemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and hepatic aminotransferases, were consistent a total of 1278 (50%) confirmed cases of H1N1 were hospitalized. of the 33 cases with pneumonia due to a bacterial coinfection, six were due to the Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. 69-year-old Caucasian man had a past medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension and type 1 diabetes. yncytial virus, and adenovirus were negative. urinary tests for Legionella antigens were positive. yncytial virus and adenovirus were negative. a 71-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 1 diabetes and chronic hepatitis C. she reported an eight day history of dry cough and fever (39.2\u00b0C) associated with sore throat and nasal congestion. her chest radiograph was consistent with multifocal pneumonia. intravenous levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and oral oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) were administered. for persistent hypoxemia she was ventilated in the prone-supine position for 12 hour intervals daily. cal swab was negative for influenza A and B antigens. no parasites were seen on a peripheral-blood smear. rhonchi were detected in the lower lung fields. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg twice daily), levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and oral oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) were administered. in 18 hours after arrival, tachypnea and hypoxemia increased further requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. hypotension and renal failure developed; methylprednisolone and vasopressors were administered. RT-PCR on a broncoalveolar lavage specimen was positive for H1N1 influenza infection. intravenous levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and oral oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) were administered. a novel influenza A virus of swine origin emerged to cause infections in humans in north America [4]. the pandemic was carefully followed by the media but with a touch of sensationalism that caused a widespread a sense of fear in the population. other infectious disorders may mimic H1N1 viral infection especially Legionnaires' disease. the immediate suspicion of Legionella infection based on clinical history, X-ray abnormalities and Winthrop University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point system scale (Table 1) were fundamental for a successful resolution. we do think that the immediate suspicion of Legionella infection based on clinical history, X-ray abnormalities and the finding of positive specimens for H1N1 influenza A infection could have caused us to arrive at a fashionable diagnosis. a recent autopsy study revealed evidence of concurrent bacterial infection in 29% of cases. in 45% of these the pathogen was S. pneumoniae. the findings confirm the results. the lack of contact with animals in an immunocompetent host appears to rule out zoonotic infections, such as Coxiella burnetii. the lack of known contact with animals in an immunocompetent host appears to rule out zoonotic infections. adenovirus type 14 is most likely cause of severe viral pneumonia in adults. radiographic findings may include lobar infiltrates, although these are more characteristic of bacterial pneumonia. lack of recent travel in H5N1 endemic areas or exposure to sick or dead poultry argue against H5N1 influenza (bird flu) ER and ICU contributed to the analysis and interpretation. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
