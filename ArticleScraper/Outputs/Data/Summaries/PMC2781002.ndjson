{"summary": "Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. distance plays a vital role in studies assessing spatial disease patterns and access to hospital services. distance is often studied as a crude but objective indicator of geographic accessibility to hospital services. a class of distance metrics, known as Minkowski distance [14], provides flexibility and generality. a single yet flexible method for measuring distance can be defined for the optimal estimation of distance on a variety of empirical road networks. if distance is a crude estimate of accessibility, travel time is a more relevant estimate. spatial analytical models are designed to mitigate negative effects. the most crucial properties of spatial data are spatial dependence (near things tend to be more similar than distant things) and non-stationarity (inconstant variability of phenomena across space) the metric thus identified is experimentally used in a spatial autoregressive model analyzing the spatial distribution of cardiac catheterization cases in the city. the study area encompasses the city of Calgary, one of the largest Canadian cities. a set of 2, 138 distances between each patient's postal code of residence and the Foothills hospital are calculated according to each of the distance measurement methods considered. a set of 2, 138 distances between each patient's postal code of residence and the Foothills hospital are calculated according to each of the distance measurement methods considered. the arcGIS 9.3 [28] geometry calculator was used to calculate the x and y coordinates based on the projected dataset. the resulting x and y values were used in the distance formulas defined below. the network analyst extension within ArcGIS [28] enables the modeling of spatial networks and provides the tools for road distance calculations [28,29] and travel time calculations [15,16] from multiple postal code locations to a hospital. an empirical solution to this problem is sought for the set of 2, 138 patient-to-hospital distances. time is computed, in order to make the transition between time and space, in terms that are valid both conceptually and computationally. the concept of speed, a simple ratio between space and time, is introduced. the average distance traveled in one hour is 58.71 km; the average time required to travel 1 kilometer is 1.02 minutes. data are released at the postal code spatial aggregation level. catheterizations performed over the year 2002, resulting in 2, 445 catheterization cases. only postal codes that have at least one catheterization case are retained for the analysis. a set of 2, 138 distances between each patient's postal code of residence and the Foothills hospital are calculated according to each of the distance measurement methods considered. the geographic locations of each postal code from the PCCF and the hospital are recorded in latitude and longitude. alternative methods could have been used, for example the great circle distance formula [27], which provides rougher estimations. the basic need for road distance calculation is a road network with information on all the segments constituting the network. additional information required for travel time calculation include estimated speed and length of road segments, along with an algorithm capable of taking all these factors into consideration. this simple method helps assess and rank the various coefficients, identifying the one that produces the highest R2 value, which is considered the best Minkowski coefficient. the procedure is then modified to determine the optimal Minkowski coefficient for travel time: conceptually, this experiment is less straightforward, because travel time is a measure of time. Figure 2 shows different values of a goodness-of-fit indicator (R2) obtained from a regular sample of p values throughout the [1 p 2] interval. it levels out for p values between 1.50 and 1.60, then decreases again for p values ranging from 1.61 to 2.00. the range of values for the best candidate of p value for travel time is in the range of 1.25 p 1.35. the curve decreases more sharply from 1.35 to 2.0. the general Minkowski formula (Equation 1) can be written as (4) where tt is the travel time that is based on the average speed. overall speed limits tend to slow down travel; that is, segments with low speed limits have a large impact on the overall travel pattern throughout the road network. this is probably due to the smoothing effect of a uniform distance model, which produces lower values than road distance. the value of p = 1.54 best approximates road distance in the minkowski formula. p = 1.31 best approximates travel time in the minkowski formula. a relatively low p value, such as p = 1.31 most closely approximates this pattern. a speed reduction from 80 to 60 km/h on long road segments significantly impacts travel time, lowering the maximum and range values, and increasing the mean value. a speed reduction from 50 to 40 or 35 km/h on shorter road segments is likely to have only a minor impact on the overall travel time. the same metrics produce the best results for travel time, with Minkowski (p = 1.31) producing the lowest standard deviation. median and mean differences are lower than 2 kilometers and just over 2 minutes. however, standard deviations tend to be quite high, relative to the mean. each metric performs worse in the west than in the east part of the city. in a city like Calgary, urban design and age of communities play an important role. the association between cardiovascular disease and socio-economic variables was recently analyzed. a close comparison of the two plots reveals how the modification of the distance metric substantially alters the neighborhood configuration. each neighborhood configuration, such as the ones presented in Figure 5, forms the basis for the definition of a spatial weight matrix. the neighborhood configuration ultimately affects the variance of the model estimates, hence their reliability. t values increase thanks to a reduction of the variance associated with the estimates. all independent variables benefit, in varying degrees, from the modified distance model. the distance model does not appreciably affect the overall goodness of fit. the same metrics produce the best results for travel time, with Minkowski (p = 1.31) producing the lowest standard deviation. median and mean differences are lower than 2 kilometers and just over 2 minutes. however, standard deviations tend to be quite high, relative to the mean. each metric performs worse in the west than in the east part of the city. in a city like Calgary, urban design and age of communities play an important role. the association between cardiovascular disease and socio-economic variables was recently analyzed. Figure 5a shows the connectivity defined by the Euclidean metric. Figure 5b corresponds to the Minkowski metric optimizing travel time (p = 1.31) a close comparison of the two plots reveals how the modification of the distance metric substantially alters the neighborhood configuration. a short summary of the parameters associated with each independent variable is presented in Table 3. the t values increase thanks to a reduction of the variance associated with the estimates. all the independent variables benefit, in varying degrees, from the modified distance model. Manhattan distance tends to overestimate road distance and travel time. the use of either of these metrics in any spatial analysis may result in inaccurate results [10] Ideally, travel time provides the most accurate estimate of a patient's travel from their place of residence to a given health facility. there are locational inaccuracies in the patient data [35] as well as in the road network. additional errors are likely to derive from the algorithm used for the distance calculations. the hypothesis of optimal conditions should be lifted, and more realistic conditions should be entered in the model. proposed method provides a single model of travel on an urban road network. the coefficient can be optimized to approximate different distances, e.g., road distance or travel time, under varying conditions. authors have no conflict of interest to declare and each has met the criteria for authorship.
