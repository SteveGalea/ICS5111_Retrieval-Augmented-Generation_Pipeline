{"summary": "the dispensary model where TB has to be diagnosed and treated in TB dispensaries, the specialist model where TB specialist hospital also treat TB patients and the integrated model where TB diagnosis and treatment is integrated into a general hospital. the study compared effects of the three models through patient experience in TB diagnosis and treatment. public hospitals are the dominant health providers and have decisive impacts on the TB program in terms of the key WHO TB control targets. china has the second highest TB burden in the world with 1.4 million patients. free treatment is only provided to TB patients treated in TB dispensaries. policy covers costs of first-line anti-TB drugs, TB sputum smears and cultures. policy does not cover hospitalization costs, second-line anti-TB drugs. china\u2019s case detection rates were low in early 2000s, mainly due to the weak linkage between public hospitals and TB dispensaries. a national TB survey in 2000 showed that 91% of TB patients visited hospitals first, while only 25% of TB suspects in hospitals were referred to TB dispensaries. TB collaboration has improved since 2005 thanks to the Internet based communicable disease reporting system developed after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. study aims to compare patient care experience within different TB control models. we choose specifically drug sensitive patients because they account for the majority of TB patients. the dispensary model This is the most prevalent model of TB practice in china. the integrated model is often found in big cities in northern china. a clinic provides TB care, under the free treatment policy, in a general hospital. patients in this model are diagnosed and treated under the TB program in the designated hospital. the current policy debates on the future of china\u2019s TB control system. an argument posited that the specialist TB hospital has good clinical capacity. the integrated model should treat all TB cases including drug sensitive patients. TB dispensaries received around 85% of their revenues from the government. each site had around 100 uncomplicated TB cases registered in a year. patients account for the majority of total TB patients in china. key study indicators included patient health expenditure, hospitalization, use of second-line anti-TB drugs, diagnostic and treatment delays. better model would better comply with national TB guideline, i.e., less use of second-line anti-TB drugs, less hospitalization, and less use of sophisticated examinations. two sites of each model were purposively selected. one urban and relatively rich site with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita over RMB20,000/USD2941. another rural and relatively poor site with GDP per capita below RMB20,000. participants were surveyed using a structured questionnaire adapted from the national TB Survey [11] which had been used in other similar settings [21], [22] questions covered patient social-economic status, care pathways, patient expenditure on TB care, and delays. patients were not aware of the exact amount of costs covered by health insurance or the free treatment policy. diagnostic delay is the period from a patient\u2019s first contact of healthcare until his/her TB diagnosis. treatment delay is the period between TB diagnosis and the start of the TB chemotherapy. negative TB cases (%) 93.4 90.6 89.1 99.3 88.5 89.8 1 USD = 6.8 RMB. in total, 293 patients were surveyed. in total, 250 outpatient charts and 88 inpatient charts were collected. GP was significantly higher than SL (2 = 8.409, P = 0.004), SC (2 = 14.952, P0.001) and GN (2 = 10.908, P = 0.001). GP was significantly higher than SL (2 = 16.134, P0.001) and GN (2 = 9.225, P = 0.005). significant difference was found among six sites (F = 11.907, P0.001). SC was significantly higher than ZD (P = 0.015), GP (P0.001), SL (P = 0.001), SDL (P = 0.001) and GN (P0.001) were significantly higher than SC. \u00a3 SDC was significantly higher than ZD (2 = 20.685, P0.001), SC (2 = 20.059, P0.001) and GN (2 = 11.009, P0.001). SL was significantly higher than ZD (2 = 6.844, P = 0.009), GP (2 = 74.037, P0.001), SDC (2 = 11.819, P = 0.001), SC (2 = 19.388, P0.001) and GN (2 = 22.093, P0.001). SL was significantly higher than GP (2 = 25.997, P0.001), SC (2 = 24.458, P0.001) and GN (2 = 22.319, P0.001). SL was significantly higher than GP (2 = 42.627, P0.001), SC (2 = 40.911, P0.001) and GN (2 = 38.580, P0.001). in the dispensary model, the ZD site had significant higher health expenditure (RMB 6200/USD 912) compared with the GP site (RMB 935/USD 138, P0.001) patient expenditure was found the highest in the SDC site of the specialist model, followed by the ZD site in the dispensary model and the GN site in the integrated model. TB dispensaries were excluded from the calculation of DOTS treatment expenditure. they were treated in the specialist hospital with a median treatment period of 209 days. significant difference was found among six sites (F = 19.859, P0.001). one third of patients borrowed money for TB care, while 56% of all patients incurred catastrophic spending due to TB treatment. patients who borrowed money were more likely to incur catastrophic expenditure (P0.001). but no correlation was found between patients who borrowed money or who incurred catastrophic expenditure and who did not have health insurance. treatment,N (% of total hospitalization) 30(58.8) 3(6.1) 37(84.1) 23(50.0) 60(66.7) 3(6.0) 2(3.8) Inpatient expenditure(M, RMB) 4,905 8,597 9,150 6,450 7,960 2,050 4,277 1 USD = 6.8 RMB, M = Median. SL was significantly higher than GP (2 = 29.910, P0.001), SC (2 = 24.836, P0.001) and 2 = 22.979, P0.001), SC (2 = 23.487, P0.001) and GN (2 = 27.879, P0.001). treatment delay was shorter in the integrated sites compared with the ZD site in the dispensary model (P0.01). hospitals were the major place for TB diagnosis. 37% of patients in the dispensary sites were diagnosed in general hospitals. 56% in the specialist sites were diagnosed in specialist hospitals. mixed results were found in the dispensary sites. SL was significantly higher than ZD (2 = 6.844, P = 0.009), GP (2 = 74.037, P0.001), SDC (2 = 11.819, P = 0.001), SC (2 = 19.388, P0.001) and GN (2 = 55.892, P0.001) significant difference was found among six sites (F = 22.386, P0.001). 42% in the dispensary sites, 74% in the specialist sites and 19% in integrated sites had used second-line anti-TB drugs. commonly used second-line anti-TB drugs were quinolones (most commonly levofloxacin), protionamide and p-aminoslicylic acid. 190 1,550 2,600 2,080 Health expenditure before diagnosis (M, RMB) 2,000 0 0 8,300 1,515 5,450 0 0 DOTS treatment expenditure(M, RMB) 2,000 600 1,160 500 2,700 2,200* 1,080 2,000 1,300 TB catastrophic expenditure ratio, N (%)\u00a3 31(60.8) 21(42.9) 52(52.0) 39(88.6) 36(78.3) 75(83.3) 15(30.0) 23(43.4) significant difference was found among six sites (F = 3.7328, P = 0.011) SL was significantly higher than ZD (2 = 9.450, P = 0.002), GP (2 = 21.223, P0.001), SC (2 = 32.918, P0.001) and GN (2 = 21.335, P0.001) the ZD site had higher hospitalization rates than the GP site. SL was significantly higher than GP (2 = 29.910, P0.001), GP (2 = 24.836, P0.001) and GN (2 = 29.122, P0.001) and GN (2 = 58.115, P0.001). significant difference was found among six sites (F = 4.034, P = 0.004) SL was significantly longer than GN (P = 0.028). SL was significantly higher than GP (2 = 31.392, P0.001), SC (2 = 32.025, P0.001) and GN (2 = 36.975, P0.001) treatment delay was shorter in the integrated sites compared with the other two models. TB cases should be treated on an outpatient basis, and be given first-line anti-TB drugs. TB cases should be diagnosed by sputum smear and X-ray, not by sophisticated examinations such as computerized tomography scan. in practice, there were almost no TB patients referred from the specialist hospital to the TB dispensary [27]. another reason may be the weakness of government coordination because specialist hospitals are often at a higher governmental level than TB dispensaries. nearly half patients received hospitalization, and a significant proportion of patients were given second-line anti-TB drugs. despite the free TB treatment policy, treatment in hospitals resulted in high financial burdens for TB patients. study found that TB patients only accounted for a small proportion of total patients. the most important challenge is how to protect patients from being exploited by profit-oriented public hospitals. data about TB treatment in hospitals and TB dispensaries was collected from patient charts to cross-check potential recall problems. rural health insurance plans have a lower coverage rates than urban health insurance plans. rural health insurance plans have a lower coverage rates than urban health insurance plans. the integrated model showed better compliance of the TB national guideline. patients with a persistent cough commonly visit general hospitals first [21], [22] in the integrated model sites, therefore they can be diagnosed and treated in the same place if found to have TB. national survey of drug-resistant TB in 2007 found that MDR TB was linked with inappropriate treatment in hospitals, especially specialist hospitals. despite the free TB treatment policy and the majority of patients being covered by medical insurance, the study found that patients had excessive financial burden. the integrated model and specialist model only operated in limited areas. but large differences were found between the two facilities in the dispensary model. study did not address complicated cases treatment as these cases account for a small proportion of total TB cases. the integrated model sites reported the worst outcomes, with the highest rate of unnecessary hospitalization and consequent financial burden on patients. the dispensary model sites showed mixed results."}
