{"summary": "there is a 15\u201325% chance of CAL developing in KD patients without early treatment. high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the most effective therapy for KD to reduce the prevalence of CAL. there has been some evidence demonstrating the role of DC-SIGN promoter variants in the susceptibility to or the protection against various infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, tuberculosis, and AIDS [7\u20139]. if DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to KD, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CD209 molecule will be involved in the path the diagnosis of coronary artery fistula (CAF) was made mainly by pulsed Doppler and color flow imaging. IVIG treatment responsiveness was defined as defevrscence 48 hrs after the completion of IVIG treatment. no fever (temperature, >38\u00b0C) recurrence for at least 7 days after the initial IVIG treatment. genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System. 100 PCR products were subject to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MscI restriction enzyme. statistical differences between case and control in genotype and allele frequency were assessed by chi-square test. the diagnosis of coronary artery fistula (CAF) was made mainly by pulsed Doppler and color flow imaging [15]. IVIG treatment responsiveness was defined as defevrscence 48 hrs after the completion of IVIG treatment. no fever (temperature, >38\u00b0C) recurrence for at least 7 days after the initial IVIG treatment with marked improvement of inflammatory signs. the PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 L using the following amplification protocol. the genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System. 100 PCR products were subject to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MscI restriction enzyme. minor G allele of rs4804803 was over represented in the KD patients as compared with the controls (8.1 versus 3.5%). the genotype or allele frequency of rs4804803 was not statistically associated with IVIG resistance or CAL formation. lic P value CD209 336 A/G GG 1 (2.9) 2 (0.8) G 9 (12.9) 36 (7.4) 0.290 0.171 0.276 0.118 GA 7 (20.0) 32 (13.2) A 61 (87.1) 450 (92.6) AA 27 (77.1) 209 (86.0) Table 4. Genotyping and allele frequency of CD209 336 A/G in patients with coronary artery lesion (CAL) and without CAL. DC-SIGN 336 (rs4804803) A/G polymorphism was Associated with the Susceptibility of Kawasaki disease. a total of 278 KD patients were included, of which 35 patients (12.6%) were resistant to initial IVIG treatment, 42 patients (15.1%) had CAL formation and 13 patients (4.7%) developed coronary artery fistula. no significant association of DC-SIGN 336 (rs4804803) A/G Polymorphism with IVIG Treatment Response and CAL Formation in KD patients. the genotype or allele frequency of rs4804803 was higher in the patients with IVIG responsiveness (86.0 versus 77.1%) and without CAL formation (85.2 versus 83.3%) the genotype or allele frequency of rs4804803 was not statistically associated with IVIG resistance (Table 2) or CAL no significant association of DC-SIGN 336 (rs4804803) A/G polymorphism with Coronary Artery Fistula Formation in KD patients. subset analysis between cases with coronary artery fistula and rs4804803 did not yield any significant results. fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus) [23] contributing to generation of pathogen-tailored immune responses and immunosuppressive response by the MAPK pathway in DCs [24]. a genetic predisposition is suggested based on clinical and epidemiologic features [1, 26]. the effects of IVIG therapy partly explain there not being an association of 336A/G SNP of the DC-SIGN gene with IVIG resistance in KD. the host's genetic background must be considered in the study of KD."}
