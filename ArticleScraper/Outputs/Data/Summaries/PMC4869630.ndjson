{"summary": "this is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa. this outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. it has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak. only three infections occurred outside west africa (two in the US and one in Spain) at the time of the EVD epidemic in west africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in august 2014. the region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016.6. liberia had 51 doctors for its population of 4.3 million people. the drastically under-resourced health care structures and systems in these countries constitute moral problems in themselves. we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the west africa EVD outbreak. public health messages stigmatized cherished traditional practices as 'risky behaviors' people were asked to make immediate and extensive changes in their core practices and ways of relating and interacting to curb EVD spread. a call for \u201cspatial\u201d quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the \u201cprinciple of least infringement\u201d. if the public health goal is containment of infectious disease, such a measure could be ethically justified. the tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement is well recognized. asymptomatic health care workers returning from west africa were required to be quarantined for 21 days. the quarantine order for health care workers returning from the EVD zone was deemed counterproductive and \u201cmorally wrong\u201d by the president\u2019s bioethics Commission. the action was not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals. ethical debates about travel restrictions Concerns about the potential for EVD to travel across borders resulted in travel restrictions in many countries. travel bans far from the Ebola epicenter defies the public health ethics principle of least infringement. the poor infrastructure and support systems for sick persons featured in the transmission chains. health care workers were afraid to provide care54 \u2013 a reasonable fear, given the high number of infections affecting the health force. there were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty. developed countries have an ethical obligation to support countries in the EVD zone. countries in the EVD zone were in dire need of support to control an outbreak that was out of hand. such support would be at minimal cost to the developed country. jecker et al87 identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency. concerns about sharing of benefits accruing from bio-specimen and data sharing have been raised in view of the competitive and privatized nature of EVD research. EVD containment may be at odds with the \u201cprinciple of least infringement\u201d. if the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease, such a measure could be ethically justified. the tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement has been widely discussed. asymptomatic health care workers returning from west africa were required to be quarantined for 21 days. the quarantine order for health care workers returning to their homeland was deemed counterproductive and \u201cmorally wrong\u201d by the president\u2019s bioethics Commission. the action was also not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals. no preferential treatment should be offered on the basis of profession as a show of respect for the rights and dignity of infected persons. the possibility of Ebola being used for bioterrorism intensified concern about cross-border movement of people exposed to EVD. the poor infrastructure and support systems for sick persons53 resulted in health care workers being afraid to provide care54 \u2013 a reasonable fear. for health professionals working outside the west africa region, the risk of exposure was remote, but nonetheless did occur due to people with EVD either traveling while ill57,58 or being medically evacuated. there were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty. developed countries had an ethical obligation to support countries in the EVD zone. countries in the EVD zone were in dire need of support to control an outbreak that was out of hand. such support would be at minimal cost to the developed country. jecker et al87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency. concerns about sharing of benefits accruing from bio-specimen and data sharing have been raised in view of the competitive and privatized nature of EVD research. the global Emerging Pathogens Consortium is considering how to compensate blood donors for their research on use of EVD survivors\u2019 blood for EVD therapy research. the impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured, yet the fact that schooling was extensively disrupted would have short-, medium-, and long-term consequences at the individual, family, and community/national level. the impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured. support is needed to help survivors resume normal lives. many EVD survivors face stigma, rejection, loss of jobs, and difficulties regaining their livelihoods. surveillance systems as an epidemiological measure and a potential tool for intervention come with ethical challenges. social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted orphaned children. policies on isolation of infected persons and quarantine of affected persons need to be based on robust legal and ethical justification. the options for practicing quarantine and isolation should not create divides between social classes and result in unjust treatment of the poor. the EVD response in west africa should be one that combines genuine respect for the dignity of people with the idea of human development. current EVD therapeutics are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the north. plans need to be instituted for future access to developed therapeutics by affected communities in the south. ethical obligation for EVD response is needed to help survivors resume normal lives. many EVD survivors face stigma, rejection, loss of jobs, and health challenges associated with EVD. surveillance systems as an epidemiological measure come with ethical challenges. the use of name-based surveillance for HIV infection107 set the precedent. social interventions include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. the national research ethics code was revised to allow for country access and use of experimental drugs on compassionate grounds for the management of EVD. the absence of this policy was a disincentive for the use of experimental drugs for Dr Sheik Humarr Khan in Sierra Leone. EVD outbreaks could still occur in the future. a global response to the EVD epidemic in west africa is an ethical requirement of national, regional, and international governments."}
