{"summary": "MV remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. it is the prototype morbillivirus of the family paramyxoviridae. it is estimated that global measles mortality is still above 100,000 cases per year. al cells grown on an air-liquid interface (ALI) (8) provided a mechanism through which MV infection of epithelial cells may occur in vivo. we have previously investigated the early and viremic phases of measles in the macaque model. we demonstrated a prominent role for CD150+ lymphocytes and myeloid cells in facilitating the spread of virus to lymphoid tissues throughout the body. vero cells stably expressing human or canine CD150 (Vero-hCD150 and Vero-cCD150 respectively) were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml using the formula of Reed and Muench (14) the number in parentheses refers to the genomic position of the ATU. the number in parentheses refers to the genomic position of the ATU. normal human bronchial epithelial cells were differentiated (dNHBE) on type I collagen- and fibronectin-coated 6.5-mm Transwell inserts with a 0.4-m pore size. cells were monitored using a DM IRBE UV microscope (Leica Microsystems) and processed using leica FW4000 software. animal handling was performed under light anesthesia using ketamine and medetomidine. atipamezole was administered to antagonize the effect of medetomidine. macroscopic foci containing EGFP were visualized and photographed. antigen binding sites were detected using anti-mouse rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated and anti-mouse rabbit and human Alexa 568-conjugated antibodies. sections were mounted on glass slides using DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). rMV stocks were generated in an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-LCL. titers were obtained by endpoint titration in vero cells expressing human or canine CD150. titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml using the formula of Reed and Muench (14) Syncytia were observed 4 to 6 days posttransfection (d.p.t.) cells were scraped into the medium and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. titers were determined on vero-cCD150 or vero-hCD150 cells. animal handling was performed under light anesthesia using ketamine and medetomidine. after handling, atipamezole was administered to antagonize the effect of medetomidine. macroscopic foci containing EGFP were visualized and photographed. antigen binding sites were detected using anti-mouse rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated and anti-mouse rabbit and human Alexa 568-conjugated antibodies. sections were mounted on glass slides using DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and an epithelial cytokeratin cell marker. the role of MV-infected immune cells in seeding the infection within respiratory tract epithelial cells was investigated by establishing an in vitro coculture model using human B-LCL and primary dNHBE cells cultured on an ALI. this allowed virus spread to be monitored over time, first from rMV-infected B-LCL to epithelial cells and second from these infected dNHBE cells to neighboring dNHBE cells. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 failed to spread from infected B-cells to adjacent epithelial cells. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 failed to spread from infected B-cells to adjacent epithelial cells. mutations were introduced into full-length antigenomic plasmid pMVKSEGFP (9) to generate pMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 and rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 was recovered in vero-cCD150 cells and passaged twice in B-LCL. rMVKSEGFP(1) and rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 were stably maintained upon virus passage. both viruses infected vero-cCD150 and B-LCL equivalently. the human epithelial cell line expresses PVRL4 (8). no progeny virus was recovered from rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4-infected cells. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4-infected B-LCL adhered to the scratch equivalently. the infectivity was not transferred to the epithelial cells. small numbers of rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4-infected B-LCL remained at 24 and 48 h.p.o. an analogous PVRL4 staining pattern was observed in focal areas of tongue epithelium. in contrast, a more irregular polarized staining pattern was observed in nasal concha epithelia in the URT and tracheal epithelia in the lower respiratory tract. PVRL4 is present around the entire cell membrane of squamous epithelial cells. high levels of PVRL4 are present throughout the bronchial epithelium surrounding the lumen of the bronchus. infected epithelial cells may arise via the lateral spread of virus within the epithelium following initial infection of an epithelial cell. akin to virus cell-to-cell spread in vitro. examination of transverse sections through the nose facilitated the detection of very large numbers of infected cells in the nasal concha. individual foci of infection were also detected in the epithelium of the nasal septum. extensive infection is visible in a transverse section through the nasal cavity. the directions of the inhaled and exhaled airflow are indicated by blue and red arrows. a schematic (inset) indicates the anatomical location of the transverse section. limited lateral spread of virus within epithelium resulted in small foci of infected tracheal pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells by 9 d.p.i. uninfected and infected CD20+ B cells were present within bronchial epithelium. colocalization is observed between EGFP (green) and cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells (red) infiltration of CD3-expressing T cells (red) into regions of epithelium containing foci of MV-infected epithelial cells (green) cytokeratin (green) and MV N (red) showed MV infection of the luminal epithelial cell layers. bar, 50 m.

(F) double labeling of EGFP (green) and cytokeratin-positive pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells (red) in a large focus of infection in URT epithelium results in clustering of cell nuclei. high levels of MV-infected cells were present in the nasal cavity of MV-infected macaques at the peak of infection. the role of MV-infected immune cells in seeding the infection within respiratory tract epithelial cells was investigated by establishing an in vitro coculture model using human B-LCL and primary dNHBE cells cultured on an ALI. this allowed virus spread to be monitored over time, first from rMV-infected B-LCL to epithelial cells and second from these infected dNHBE cells to neighboring dNHBE cells. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 failed to spread from infected B-cells to adjacent epithelial cells. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 failed to spread from infected B-cells to adjacent epithelial cells. mutations were introduced into full-length antigenomic plasmid pMVKSEGFP (9) to generate pMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 and rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 was recovered in vero-cCD150 cells and passaged twice in B-LCL. rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4 was stably maintained upon virus passage. both viruses infected CD150-expressing cell lines vero-cCD150 and B-LCL equivalently. the human epithelial cell line NCI-H358 (17) expresses PVRL4 (8). no progeny virus was recovered from rMVKSEGFP(1). rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4-infected B-LCL adhered to the scratch equivalently. small numbers of rMVKSEGFP(1)PVRL4-infected B-LCL remained at 24 and 48 h.p.o. in rare cases, foci comprise of 2 or 3 infected epithelial cells apparently were observed at 72 h.p.o. an analogous PVRL4 staining pattern was observed in focal areas of tongue epithelium. a more irregular polarized staining pattern was observed in nasal concha epithelia in the URT and tracheal epithelia in the lower respiratory tract. high levels of PVRL4 expression were also observed in the lung. PVRL4 is present around the entire cell membrane of squamous epithelial cells. high levels of PVRL4 are present throughout the bronchial epithelium surrounding the lumen of the bronchus. of infection revealed circular foci of MV-infected epithelial cells. these may arise via the lateral spread of virus within the epithelium. these may arise via the lateral spread of virus within the epithelium. the directions of the inhaled and exhaled airflow are indicated by blue and red arrows, respectively, and a schematic (inset) indicates the anatomical location of the transverse section. no cell-to-cell fusion was observed between MV-infected cells. limited lateral spread of virus within epithelium resulted in small foci of infected tracheal pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells by 9 d.p.i. uninfected and infected CD20+ B cells were present within bronchial epithelium. colocalization is observed between EGFP (green) and cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells (red) infiltration of CD3-expressing T cells (red) into regions of epithelium containing foci of MV-infected epithelial cells (green) infiltration of uninfected and infected CD20-positive B cells (red) into bronchial epithelium from an aggregate of lymphoid tissue. no alteration of PVRL4 expression (green) is visible within large foci of MV-infected cells (red) in the trachea. bar, 80 m.

(F) double labeling of EGFP (green) and cytokeratin-positive pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells (red) in a large focus of infection in URT epithelium results in clustering of cell nuclei. high levels of MV-infected cells were present in the nasal cavity of MV-infected macaques at the peak of infection. MV spreads systemically and infection of respiratory tract tissues occurs predominantly in the late stages of the disease. a paucity of published pathological studies from human measles cases made use of a set of diverse tissue blocks free of complications caused by underlying disease or secondary bacterial infections. MV spread into epithelia is most likely mediated via the interaction of MV glycoprotein complexes on the surface of immune cells with PVRL4. this provides a mechanism through which MV can access a cellular receptor that is inaccessible to virus present in the lumen of the respiratory tract. polarized expression of PVRL4 was observed along the basolateral surface of pseudostratified ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea and nasal concha. the location of PVRL4 at adherens cell junctions of epithelial cells means that this molecule is inaccessible to cell-free virus present at the apical side. the trachea has been proposed as the primary site from which MV emerges into the airways of the respiratory tract prior to transmission to a susceptible host (8, 20) in the case of Sendai virus, transmission of virus from infected animals was directly associated with infection of the URT and was independent of infection in the lung (24). in the case of Sendai virus, transmission of virus from infected animals was directly associated with infection of the URT and was independent of infection in the lung (24). Conversely, H5N1 strains of influenza cause significant disease in humans with high case fatality rates."}
