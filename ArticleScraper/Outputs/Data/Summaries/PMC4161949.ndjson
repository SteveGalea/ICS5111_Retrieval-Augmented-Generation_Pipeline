{"summary": "research is still in its infancy, especially in middle- and low-income countries. aim is to promote the effectiveness of the health response for reducing disaster-related mortality and morbidity. the 2008 wenchuan earthquake caused the collapse of 67.5% of healthcare buildings in the worst affected areas (24). a large proportion of the county hospitals were destroyed or lost their critical systems. a number of the township hospitals and village clinics required temporary facilities to support their ongoing roles. more than 75% of tertiary hospitals in the Shandong province had stockpiles of emergency supplies (e.g. medicine, food, water, stretcher, and tourniquet) only a small number of hospitals had signed a memorandum of agreement with other regional hospitals to share these supplies during disasters (28). this response is critical for facilitating the process of field triage, transport, and transfer. most secondary and tertiary hospitals in china acknowledge they have insufficient surge (extra) beds to meet the demands during disasters. the surge beds accounted for only 8.5% of all the fixed beds after the SARS crisis in 2004 (13) in 2012, only 65.9% of the tertiary hospitals in the Shandong Province were able to surge patient-care beds within 24 hours. the guidelines stipulated two phases for psychological interventions. the first phase, the acute phase, occurs when general psychological counselling is used to reduce the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. the second phase, the chronic phase, occurs when psychological interventions are focused on issues associated with depression. there is no official guideline, protocol, or legal standard for patient management and transfer between these two sectors. in most regions, pre-hospital emergency services lack effective cooperation with the fire and police departments. a lack of cooperation may result in the loss of precious rescue time for advanced pre-hospital medical care. funding gaps and disparities in distribution of funds present major challenges for healthcare organizations providing medical care during a disaster response. the first disparity occurs between the funding of urban and rural areas. the first disparity occurs between the funding of urban and rural areas. a large number of search and rescue teams are dispatched to the disaster zones. if there is an oversupply of teams, the influx of too many teams may become a burden on limited supplies for the victims. this situation may lead to the waste of resources and result in low efficiency."}
