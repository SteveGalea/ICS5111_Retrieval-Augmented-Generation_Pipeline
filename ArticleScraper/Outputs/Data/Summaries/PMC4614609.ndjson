{"summary": "the current outbreak is the largest one ever documented. it is the first recorded outbreak of Ebola in west africa (2). the previous largest outbreaks of Ebola virus was identified in Uganda in 2000\u20132001. current Ebola virus has 97% homology with ZEBOV (6, 7) other sub-types include Bundibugyo (BDBV), SUDV, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire or Tai Forest (TAFV) and Reston Ebola viruses. RESTV infection has been observed in animals in Asia and as an asymptomatic disease in humans. mosquitoes and other insects do not play a role in virus transmission. less than 10 viral particles are enough for becoming infected. the disease is not transmissible until the patient becomes symptomatic. it continues to be contagious, even postmortem. complete blood count usually shows leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. hematogenous spread of virus to the liver and spleen leads to hepatocellular injury marked by elevated liver enzymes. gM and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) can also be detected. using antigen- or antibody-based assays or PCR testing should be performed in level 4 biosafety laboratories. no specific antiviral agent or vaccine against Ebola viruses. latest CDC algorithm regarding emergency department evaluation and management for possible Ebola infected patients. educating and training medical staff on universal precautions, risk assessment, and use of personal protective equipment is crucial."}
