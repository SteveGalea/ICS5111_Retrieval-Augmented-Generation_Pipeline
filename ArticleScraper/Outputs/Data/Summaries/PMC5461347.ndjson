{"summary": "a model organism should be accessible, experimentally tractable, have short generation times, be affordable to maintain and breed, possess clearly identifiable features that are to be studied, and more recently be genetically tractable. the available model organisms span a great taxonomic range, and for many questions single-celled organisms such as bacteria are sufficient. the value of rodents, and mice in particular, has also been highlighted for leading to fundamental insights in infection biology. this review encourages experimentalists to consider a broad set of potential rodent models in order to identify and use the best available system. Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium spp are most often transmitted to their host either via ingestion of contaminated food, water, or via a vector (e.g., mosquitoes or flies; see Table 2). DALYs (*1,000) 2010a DALYs (*1,000) 2015b Lower respiratory infections 115,227 (95,983)c 142,384 Influenza 19,244 the diseases caused, transmission routes, and suitability of rodents as models for human disease are listed for selected protozoan parasites. parasite species Disease (organ(s) mainly affected) Transmission route Suitability of rodent model for human infectious species References Plasmodium spp. the impact of protozoan infections is expressed as 'disability-adjusted life-years' these diseases ranked second in importance across all infectious diseases, behind lower respiratory infections, and before AIDS and tuberculosis. this disease was still ranked among the top 20 leading diseases as identified by the WHO worldwide in 2015. rodents have been successfully used as models in malaria research. but the suitability of the mouse to mimic severe human malaria has been questioned. research on human sleeping sickness (T. brucei) has benefitted largely from mouse models. similar numbers are reported in the united kingdom, with 82% of all research using rodents, again dominated by M. musculus (74.6%; UK Home Office, 2015). the number of publications where mice and rats were mentioned in the title dominates all other model organisms included. more than 450 inbred mouse strains established since the first strain (DBA/2) was developed by Clarence Cook Little. but with advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene modifications in rats this will likely change. this method has worked so far in almost all organisms tried. inbred strains are genetically homogenous, well-defined, and often with genomes and SNP data available. wild-derived strains are \u201cdescendants of mice captured in wild populations during the mid to late 20th century and represent several different Mus species from around the world\u201d RIS is a collection of mice established by inbreeding two existing inbred strains into a set of strains. each such strain is genetically homogenous, but \u201cparallel\u201d strains produced from the same two well-defined ancestral strains are genetically more different from each other than either of the two ancestors. animal psychological status has been shown to influence variability in experimental studies, including examples of more reproducible results from \u201chappier\u201d mice. wild mice can run several 100 m per night (Latham and Mason, 2004) including a means for physical activity (e.g., running wheels) is not standard in animal housing. inbred strains are genetically homogenous, well-defined, and often with genomes and SNP data available. wild-derived inbred strains are considered suitable for, e.g., wild rodents. wild-derived inbred strains represent several different Mus species from around the world. RIS is a collection of mice established by inbreeding two existing inbred strains into a set of strains. each such strain is genetically homogenous, but \u201cparallel\u201d strains produced from the same two well-defined ancestral strains are genetically more different from each other than either of the two ancestors. mice may in some cases be under experimental study and manipulated, for example by regular trapping, diet manipulations and drug treatment. animal psychological status has been shown to influence variability in experimental studies, including examples of more reproducible results from \u201chappier\u201d mice. a translational mouse model that lacks human feature X will never give a response in X, no matter how important it is in the context of a human disease. a translational mouse model that lacks human feature X will never give a response in X, no matter how important that particular feature is in the context of a human disease. two past examples from different disciplines (sepsis and immunology) caused lively discussions in the scientific community. they were subsequently analyzed in great detail. they can thus provide valuable insights of general importance for scientists. transcriptome analysis is a fairly easily accessible and promising technique. but these relatively young tools require close evaluation of the entire work-flow. the CD28 superagonist antibody \u201cdisaster\u201d is well known that substantial differences between the mouse and human immune systems exist. cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys were a poor model for humans. the monkeys were a poor model for humans, despite their phylogenetically close relationship. the use of \u201cdirty\u201d and humanized mice better mimicked human biology than the rodent models which were used in the pre-clinical studies. re-analysis and meta-analysis \u2014 three studies and three conclusions Due to its importance for human health, research on sepsis in mouse models is heavily funded, but its translational success has so far been disappointing. transcriptome analysis is a fairly easily accessible and promising technique. the CD28 superagonist antibody \u201cdisaster\u201d is well known that substantial differences between the mouse and human immune systems exist. a humanized monoclonal antibody was directed against the human T cell receptor CD28. cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys were a poor model for humans. the monkeys were a poor model for humans, despite their phylogenetically close relationship. later experiments have demonstrated that at least two drastically modified lab mouse models can indeed be good models. non-genetic confounders in rodent infections with protozoan parasites Lab rodent models have been essential for understanding molecular, cellular, and immunological responses. even so, sources of variation which influence experimental outcomes in lab experiments have also been identified in these very models. variation in microbiota is known to influence both local and systemic immune function by altering the balance of Th1/Th2 cell composition, influencing re-localization of neutrophils, or affecting macrophage polarization. differences in microbiota can have a substantial impact on protozoan parasite infections in the gut and elsewhere. microbiota alters the gut microbiota. skin microbiota has also been shown to influence the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. the microbiota does not only affect the site of infection but can also influence how host and parasite interact at other sites. the severity of malaria infection with rodent Plasmodium spp. can also depend on vendor. sex and age Two long-known factors influence infection success by parasites are sex and age. X chromosome-linked mutations and sex-specific behavior can also affect the outcome of infectious diseases. hamsters showed age-dependent differences in infection persistence measured by time for shedding oocysts. mouse age-specific differences in the induction of adaptive immunity. it is not unusual to use only male or female mice (Fl\u00f3rez-Vargas et al., 2016) based on convenience, local availability, costs, legal issues (more animals required when both sexes are examined) in infectious disease research there is a strong bias toward using female mice. variation in microbiota is known to influence both local and systemic immune function by altering the balance of Th1/Th2 cell composition, influencing re-localization of neutrophils, or affecting macrophage polarization. differences in microbiota can have a substantial impact on protozoan parasite infections in the gut and elsewhere. the complexity of microbiome influences is not limited to gut microbiota. skin microbiota has also been shown to influence the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. parasites may not be adequate to elucidate the dynamic role of microbiota during infection. the microbiota does not only affect the site of infection but can also influence how host and parasite interact at other sites. organoids lack tissue-specific immune cells and in the GIT the microbiota, and therefore complexity is low compared to in vivo settings. this feature allows the researcher to construct an experimental setup with exactly the desired level of complexity. for elucidating the role of individual actors during a parasitic infection, organoids are promising alternatives to animal models. sex and age Two long-known factors influence infection success by parasites are sex and age. X chromosome-linked mutations and sex-specific behavior can also affect the outcome of infectious diseases. hamsters displayed age-dependent differences in infection persistence measured by time for shedding oocysts, whereas mice did not. the results demonstrate that rodents can be used to study cryptosporidosis. however, translational success is not obvious. in infectious disease research there is a strong bias toward using female mice. one reason is presumably that they are less aggressive and thus cheaper since they can be housed in (experimental) groups in a single cage whereas this is challenging for male mice. younger mice are cheaper to obtain since housing cost are lower. convenience rather than scientific reasoning might influence the choice of sex or age in many studies. p1 accounts for species-specific inflammasome induction - and thus outcome. differences between model animals can also be due to polymorphisms in inflammasome pathway effectors, e.g., IL-18 and IL-1. wild-derived mice are resistant to infection by much higher numbers of the same T. gondii strain. this work emphasizes that the definition of virulence is heavily dependent on the animal of choice and that its definition should always be accompanied by stating experimental conditions. human-infecting P. falciparum now can be researched in lab mice. more advanced models with engrafted human hepatocytes (FRG-NOD huHep) have been used to establish the complete development of the pre-erythrocytic liver stage of P. falciparum after mosquito bite. humanized mice are probably best considered as a promising, but yet developing, tool in translational research. host-specificity has limited the choice of model systems for studying protozoan parasites. d strains, or the study will lack statistical power to correlate experimental differences with certain genotypes, have been established. the concept for producing RIS sets has been extended by the Complex Traits Consortium to produce more genetically variable sets. each CC strain is at least 90% homogenous and hence genetically well-defined. CC and DO mice are all derived from subspecies, which limits the genetic variation. this may have resulted in the elimination of genetic variation at these genomic loci. however, it is expected that further crosses will improve these models on the genetic level. world population has metabolic syndrome, defined by the International Diabetes Federation as either diabetes / prediabetes, abdominal obesity, high cholesterol or high blood pressure. the role of microbiota has gained interest in this field because of potential new treatments which can manipulate the microbiome community and function. a recent contribution to this topic questions the rodent model to mimic metabolic disease and microbiota correlations in humans. a potentially important difference between the described rodent studies and the human study is the fact that humans are a \u201cwild\u201d population. the effects of both previous and current microbe colonization and/or infections do influence immune responses in an individual. a \u201cdirty\u201d or wild rodent population would be a more suitable choice when the aim is to investigate correlations in a highly complex biological system. co-housed mice responded similarly to wild-caught pet shop mice in terms of infection. co-infected mice had different immune gene signatures, cytokine expression and antibody levels in the blood both before and after yellow fever virus vaccination compared with their SPF lab mice controls. wild mouse species (M. musculus) are infected with mainly ectoparasites and a few nematodes. many studies do not exhaustively sample for ectoparasites and protozoans. many studies do not exhaustively sample for ectoparasites. several well-studied wild rodents are commonly infected with protozoan parasites. wild populations of A. sylvaticus in the united kingdom have been found to be infected with C. parvum, C. muris. wild populations of A. sylvaticus in the united kingdom have been found to be infected with C. parvum. the benefits of using wild rodent-parasite models to better understand protozoan infection dynamics include the ability to conduct longitudinal field experiments which follow marked individuals throughout their lives. the researchers repeatedly treated one population with a standard insecticide to reduce the prevalence of fleas. the availability of genomes for wild rodents has enabled the ability to measure immunological expression in wild rodent populations. a recent investigation of wild field voles measured expression of a wide range of innate and adaptive responses by cultured and stimulated splenocytes. lab mice have been selected for decades for docile behavior. wild mice show anxious behavior under natural conditions. differences in the microbiota can have profound effects. experiments with \"fearless\" lab mice in non-natural terrains may not accurately reflect the behavioral changes induced by a parasite like T. gondii under natural conditions. experiments with \"fearless\" lab mice may not accurately reflect the behavioral changes induced by a parasite like T. gondii. polymorphisms in immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) affecting the rodent immune responses to T. gondii were described in a study comparing the DNA sequences of several inbred and wild-derived mice. the authors showed that while the sequences of all the examined lab mice were highly conserved, genes in the wild-derived mice were extremely diverse, comparable to the diversity of MHC genes. new advances in the development of humanized mice offer the possibility to study human infectious diseases which could previously not be investigated in mice. new models with engrafted human hepatocytes (FRG-NOD huHep) have been further used to establish the complete development of the pre-erythrocytic liver stage of P. falciparum. the development of mature sexual stages (gametocytes) that are necessary to complete the parasite life cycle is still inefficient. however, it seems possible that complete P. falciparum (and other human Plasmodium spp.) life cycles could be routinely maintained using humanized mice. such mice were also used to conduct a genetic cross between two strains in those animals. recombinant inbred strains and collaborative cross are used in lab mice. models beyond inbred animals are required to document influence of genetic heterogeneity on experimental results. this is true in translational research, where humans represent a genetically diverse population. CCs were designed specifically for complex trait analysis (Churchill et al., 2004; Threadgill and Churchill, 2012) and the derived Diversity Outbred (DO) population (Churchill et al., 2012) has resulted in an even more genetically diverse mouse population. other derivatives of CC's concept exist, like the Heterogeneous Stock mice (Valdar et al., 2006) or the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (B the IRG locus is highly homogenous in 5 of the 8 founder strains (black ***) but highly polymorphic in the 3 wild-derived strains CAST, PWK, and WSB, indicated by differently colored *** in the chromosomes. individuals in natural populations encounter seasonal and spatial variability in the environment, as well as differences in climate and food availability. a recent contribution to this topic questions the rodent model to mimic metabolic disease and microbiota correlations in humans. in a study performed on 57 overweight and obese adult men, the systemic effects of two antibiotic treatments compared to placebo were investigated. the authors did not see significant responses to antibiotics treatment. the role of microbiota has gained interest in this field because of potential new treatments which can manipulate the microbiome community and function. a recent contribution to this topic questions the rodent model to mimic metabolic disease and microbiota correlation in humans. the effects of previous and current microbe colonization and/or infections do influence immune responses in an individual. a \u201cdirty\u201d or wild rodent population would be a more suitable choice when the aim is to investigate correlations in a highly complex biological system. co-housed mice responded similarly to wild-caught pet shop mice in terms of infection. co-infected mice had different immune gene signatures, cytokine expression and antibody levels in the blood both before and after yellow fever virus vaccination compared with their lab mice controls. these expression patterns resemble those of pet store-raised mice. wild mouse species (M. musculus) are infected with mainly ectoparasites and a few nematodes. many studies do not exhaustively sample for ectoparasites and protozoans. many studies do not exhaustively sample for ectoparasites. wild populations of A. sylvaticus in the united kingdom have been found to be infected with protozoan parasites. wild populations of A. sylvaticus in the united kingdom have been found to be infected with C. parvum, C. muris, and five species of Eimeria. the benefits of using wild rodent-parasite models to better understand protozoan infection dynamics include the ability to conduct longitudinal field experiments which follow marked individuals throughout their lives while measuring infection status, physiological and demographic metrics. the researchers repeatedly treated one population with a standard insecticide to reduce the prevalence of fleas. the availability of genomes for wild rodents has enabled the ability to measure immunological expression in wild rodent populations. wild rodents reach large sample sizes, can be recaptured using live traps, marked and followed before and after interventions, and are commonly infected with protozoan parasites. lab mice have been selected for decades for docile behavior, while wild mice show anxious behavior under natural conditions. however, no behavioral differences were found in one study but were indeed found in another. aversive responses to predator odor can differ dramatically between individual lab rats. experiments with \u201cfearless\u201d lab mice may not accurately reflect the behavioral changes induced by a parasite like T. gondii under natural conditions. there are increasing numbers of genomes and/or transcriptomes available for wild rodents. most of them are \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d considering assemblage status and annotations. there is for instance no clear definition of a required coverage for referring to DNA sequences as a \u201cgenome\u201d. generic model organism database provides tools and data models for subsequent representation of their annotated genomes and curated data of their model organism. transcriptomes do not necessarily predict protein levels It should be emphasized that genomic and transcriptomic data provide only indirect means with regards to proteomic output in response to infection. IFN- is known to be highly species-specific, which made the production of a recombinant protein active with M. glareolus or Microtus spp. cell lines a prerequisite. starting from genomic sequences and going to the purification of active recombinant protein from E. coli required less than half a year and will now provide the scientific community with this important cytokine. the mouse Genomes Project is the biggest collection of genomic data on rodents. Currently it consists of whole-genome assemblages and strain-specific gene annotations of 16 inbred and wild-derived mouse strains. assemblages can be useful references for highly recombinant outbred strains. genomes of non-model rodents will serve as excellent resources for developing species-specific tools to measure, for example, expression of immunological responses to infection. genomes of non-model organisms will serve as excellent resources for developing species-specific tools to measure, for example, expression of immunological responses to infection. humanized mice showed that for many genes the levels of the corresponding protein varied substantially in genetically divergent mice. Sex also influenced protein amounts within a given species. antibodies, cytokines, and protein quantification are still the cornerstone for qualitative and quantitative determination of immunological parameters like chemokines. a database with corresponding peptides from human and mouse proteomes does exist. work similar to the studies mentioned will hopefully expand the toolbox for non-model rodents in the near future. a dedicated web site with information on such shared resources would greatly boost the interest and ease of use of non-model organisms. author contributions TE, FT, CK, AP, and FS contributed to the text. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
