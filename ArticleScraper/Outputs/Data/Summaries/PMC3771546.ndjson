{"summary": "the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the normal control of cardiovascular and renal function. but the system also becomes a contributing factor in the development and progression of various types of cardiovascular disease (CVD) renin plays a pivotal role in the cleavage of angiotensinogen. enzyme controls levels of circulating Ang II, which acts as a humoral factor. many tissues have the capacity to produce angiotensinogen, renin (or renin-like enzymes), and ACE to produce Ang II at the local tissue level. ACE2 was first cloned from 5\u2019 sequencing of a human heart failure ventricle cDNA library in 2000 (17, 30, 71) it shares 42% of the genomic structure of ACE but is not expressed as widely as ACE. enzymatic control of Ang II and Ang-(1\u20137) production is complicated by the fact that ACE2 can also metabolize Ang-(1\u20139) into Ang-(1\u20137). Ang-(1\u201312) can increase Ang-(1\u20137) levels, likely due to indirect effect on enhanced Ang I and Ang II production and ACE2 activity. but a potential direct conversion to Ang-(1\u20137) by neprilysin or other peptidases has been suggested. link between angiotensin pathways and NO\u2022 production and signaling effects centers upon Ang-(1\u20137) and activation of its specific receptor Mas. the specific binding sites or receptors for Ang-(1\u20137) were mostly unknown until Santos et al. identified the Ang-(1\u20137) receptor as the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the Mas protooncogene. despite these reservations, there is good evidence that the Mas receptor mediates most of the known biological and physiological effects of Ang-(1\u20137) in different tissues. the renin/ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis is opposed by the actions of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas receptor axis. this is partly due to the inhibitory action of MAP kinase- or cyclooxygenase-2-dependent pathways, or stimulation of nitric oxide (NO\u2022)/cGMP-dependent pathway by Ang-(1\u20137) (36, 63) ang-(1\u20137) may be associated with stimulation of growth-stimulatory pathways in human mesangial cells. ang-(1\u20137) also has been associated with accelerated strepzotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy (67) and Ang II-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (67) impairment of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas receptor axis was associated with increased blood pressure (5) and acute renal ischemic and reperfusion injury (11) in the kidney, ACE2 protein levels are significantly decreased in hypertensive rats. overexpression of ACE2 to increase Ang-(1\u20137) production or stimulation of the Mas receptor by Ang-(1\u20137) in target tissues remains to be considered a therapeutic intervention. chronic infusion of either Ang-(1\u20137) (29) or its stable non-peptide analog AVE-0991 is cardioprotective in experimental heart failure. the beneficial antiarrhythmic effects of Ang (1\u20137) on the failing heart result from the combined effect of the peptide on the sodium pump. however, Ang-(1\u20137) at supraphysiological concentrations in isolated hearts induced early-after depolarization (12) angiotensinogen is expressed broadly throughout the central nervous system with high levels in the hypothalamus and brainstem. local levels of Ang-(1\u201312) are higher than Ang I and Ang II in brain areas where local RAS exists. ACE2 is widespread throughout the mouse brain, present in nuclei involved in the central regulation of cardiovascular function. a dense Mas receptor immunoreactive staining was observed in cardiovascular-related areas from the medulla to the forebrain. a dense Mas receptor immunoreactive staining was observed in cardiovascular-related areas from the medulla to the forebrain. ACE2 may serve as the principal enzyme for the balance between the renin/ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis and the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas receptor axis in the brain. evidence suggests ACE2 acts as a critical enzyme for the function of Ang-(1\u20137) in the brain. overexpressing ACE2 in the PVN normalized the decreased nNOS protein levels in the PVN in rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) overexpression of ACE2 in the central nervous system abrogated the Ang II-mediated reduction in NOS expression in brain regions known to be involved in regulating arterial blood pressure (19). overexpression of ACE2 in the central nervous system abrogated the Ang II-mediated reduction in NOS expression in brain regions known to be involved in regulating arterial blood pressure (19). ACE2 transfection significantly increased nNOS protein levels in the PVN in rats with CHF. ACE2 transfection also significantly improved the attenuated renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), arterial pressure, and heart rate responses to NOS inhibitor L-NMMA administration within the PVN in the rats with CHF. nNOS (A), ACE2 and Mas receptor (B) are increased in AdACE2-treated NG108 cells. nNOS, Mas-R, and ACE2 are increased in nNOS, Mas-R, but not in ACE2. nNOS, Mas-R, and ACE2 are increased in nNOS, but not in ACE2. Ang-(1\u20137) is capable of increasing nNOS-derived NO\u2022 levels. this activates hyperpolarizing IKv in neurons. ang-(1\u20137)/Mas receptor activation has been shown to activate eNOS via a Akt-dependent pathway. Gwathmey et al. showed a marked sensitivity of the intracellular NO\u2022 response to Ang-(1\u20137). this implies that renal nuclei expression of Mas receptor is functionally linked to NO\u2022 formation. but a direct effect of ACE2 activation on NOS expression had not been studied until our in vitro data in NG108 cell cultures (82). angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE, ACE2) and angiotensin receptors (AT1-R, AT2-R, Mas-R) are increased in CHF. ACE2 and the Ang-(1\u20137) receptor (Mas-R) are decreased. Ang-(1\u20137) enhances IKv in glomus cells via Mas receptor activation of nNOS and NO\u2022 production. ang-(1\u20137) may act to maintain NOS expression and NO\u2022 restraint of CB chemoreceptor activity. ACE2 and ACE2 activity are suppressed, whereas ACE and the AT1 receptor are upregulated in the CB in CHF. a consistent picture is emerging concerning RAS influences on autonomic neurons. the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in ACE upregulation and ACE2 downregulation. many transcription factors (1) are redox sensitive, and this may be a transduction mechanism that becomes dysfunctional in CVD to create imbalances in the expression and function of the hierarchical RAS system. a number of major questions remain to be addressed. no conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors."}
