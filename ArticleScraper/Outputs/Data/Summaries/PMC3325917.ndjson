{"summary": "the caliciviruses are a family of small non-enveloped viruses. they possess a non-segmented, polyadenylated, positive-sense ssRNA genome. they have a non-segmented, polyadenylated, positive-sense ssRNA genome of about 7.5 to 8.5 kb in length. at present, SaVs are classified formally into 5 genogroups based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length VP1 sequence. additional genogroups have been proposed to accommodate some novel SaVs discovered in recent years. human SaV infections are reported to be similar to or milder than human norovirus infections. novel calicivirus sequences were amplified from several faecal samples. genome sequences were obtained for three strains of the bat SaV. no obvious signs of enteric disease, like anorexia and diarrhoea, were observed in bats. the NCBI non-redundant protein database produced hits to SaV sequences. the most closely related sequence was the RdRp sequence of porcine SaV (GenBank accession number ACT98315) at 43% aa identity. each genome is predicted to contain 3 overlapping ORFs. the 5\u2032-UTR and the 3\u2032-UTR are 9 nt and 225 nt respectively. the length of the 3\u2032-UTR is considerably longer than other SaVs. the complete ORF1 is 6855 nt long and encodes a large precursor polyprotein with an estimated molecular mass of 246.8 kDa. the polyprotein contains characteristic amino acid motifs conserved in caliciviruses. the cleavage site that generates the major capsid protein is predicted to be located between residues 1740 (E) and 1741 (G) an in-frame AUG start codon is located in a favourable context for translation initiation (GUGUUUGUGAUGGA) just upstream to the cleavage site, which has also been reported in other caliciviruses [39], [39]. group Bat SaV/TLC34/HK Bat SaV/TLC39/HK Bat SaV/TLC39/HK Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pairwise amino acid identity (%) Pair the complete ORF2 is 615 nt long, with an overlapping region of 8 nt with the 3\u2032 terminus of ORF1. a translational upstream ribosome binding site motif (CAUGGGACC; underline indicates region complementary to 18 S ribosomal rRNA sequence) could be identified at 24 nt upstream of the ORF2 start codon. sequences were available with the Recombination Analysis Tool. phylogenetic positions of the bat SaVs are supported by high Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test. the novel bat virus is classified as a new member of the genus Sapovirus in the family Caliciviridae. the genome organization of the bat SaV is highly similar to that of the SaVs as shown above. studies on other animal RNA viruses suggest that CpG suppression is a major factor in their genome evolution. results confirm the presence of significant CpG suppression (CG0.78) in examined SaV genomes. no obvious signs of enteric disease, like anorexia and diarrhoea, were observed in the bats. RT-PCR using broadly reactive degenerate primers for a 185 nt fragment in the 3D-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of the calicivirus ORF1 gene was positive in two specimens. complete genome of bat SaV strain TLC58 (Genbank accession number JN899075) is 7696 nt in length and has a genomic G+C content of 60.2 mol%. each genome is predicted to contain 3 overlapping ORFs, comparable to that of other known SaVs.

PCR cycling conditions were as follows: hot start at 94\u00b0C for 7 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination and no false-positive signal was observed in the negative controls. PCR product and sequencing Purified PCR products were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. the vector was then used to transform the competent Escherichia coli strain DH5. positive transformants were identified by blue\u2013white screening. eight colonies were selected for DNA sequencing of the construct. codon usage and summary statistic of codon usage bias (Nc and Nc\u2032) were calculated using the INCA package version 2.1 [59], where Nc is the effective number of codons in the coding regions of the genome [60], and Nc\u2032 is the effective number of codons adjusted for background nucleotide composition [61]. RNA extraction was performed using a QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) the RNA was eluted into 50 l RNase-free water. RT-PCR was performed by amplifying a 185 nt fragment in the RdRp region. PCR products were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3730xl DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems) RT-PCR screening was performed on the same samples using specific primers designed from previous rounds of RT-PCR and sequencing. PCR primers were designed by targeting conserved regions as primer-binding sites. additional primers for subsequent rounds of PCR were designed based on results of earlier rounds of genome sequencing. genomic GC skew was calculated for the SaV genomes. the strength of the GC skew had been suggested to correlate with the degree of cytosine deamination [41], [44], [62].
