{"summary": "coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing the largest known single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 30 kb (1). the N protein is synthesized in large amounts and is thought to play an important role by specifically packaging the viral genome into a filamentous nucleocapsid of 10 to 15 nm in diameter. the 409 amino acids long IBV N protein is composed of two globular domains that are resistant to proteolysis. residues 218 to 329 form its C-terminal dimerization domain (5,14) outer surface of the N-terminal domain is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, a common feature for RNA-binding proteins (15) residues Arg-76 and Tyr-94, located at the base of the positively charged flexible hairpin loop and on the hydrophobic platform, were critical for RNA binding and viral infectivity. cells were lysed by sonication and purified by metal affinity chromatography. five fragments spanning the entire IBV genome were obtained by RT\u2013PCR from vero cells infected with the vero cell-adapted IBV p65. the PCR products were purified from agarose gels and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO or pGEM-T Easy (Promega) vectors. fragment A was removed from pCR-XL-TOPO by digestion with NheI and EcoRI. the in vitro synthesized full-length and N transcripts were generated by using a linearized pKT0-IBVN containing IBV N gene and the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) as templates. the in vitro synthesized full-length and N transcripts were treated with DNase I and purified with phenol/chloroform. Western blot analysis Vero cells were infected with wild type and Q74A mutant virus at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell. total RNA was extracted from cells infected with wild type or mutant viruses at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell. plasmids PCR products covering the IBV sequence from 25 957\u201326 352 nt were amplified by using a chemiluminescence detection kit. the PCR fragments were digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET-16b (Novagen) membranes were washed three times for 15 min each with the probe buffer. membranes were washed three times for 15 min each with the probe buffer. fragments spanning the entire IBV genome were obtained by RT\u2013PCR. fragments A and B, and fragments C, D and E were first ligated with T4 DNA ligase at 4\u00b0C overnight. final ligation products were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) northern blot analysis Vero cells were infected with wild type and mutant viruses at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell. total RNA was extracted from cells infected with wild type and mutant viruses. proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Stratagene) and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking buffer. membrane was incubated with 1:2000 diluted primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. polypeptides were detected with a chemiluminescence detection kit. positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein were proposed to bind a 32 nt stem\u2013loop structure located at the 3\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV RNA genome. strands 2 and 3 as well as the flexible -hairpin from the IBV nucleocapsid protein could fulfill a similar role by interacting with phosphate groups from an RNA ligand. MHV (Murine Hepatitis Virus, strain 1, AAA46439), TGEV (Porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, strain RM4, AAG30228) and SARS (SARS-Coronavirus, 1SSK_A) were obtained from GenBank. mutational analysis of amino acid residues essential for RNA-binding. the binding affinities of mutated IBV N protein N-terminal domains towards positive and negative RNA ligands were evaluated by northwestern blot. mutants were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to Hybond C extra membrane and detected by digoxin-labelled RNA. RNA binding activities of this mutant to positive and negative probes were reduced to 27 and 25%, respectively, of the wild type. a circular dichroism analysis of the two corresponding R76A and Y94A single mutants was performed to check whether the mutant proteins were properly folded. the spectra obtained for these two mutants were similar to the wild-type protein, ruling out any drastic conformational change introduced by the mutations. introduction of single amino acid substitutions into the IBV genome. in vitro transcribed full-length RNA molecules derived from wild type and mutant constructs were generated by in vitro transcription. no CPE formation was observed in cells transfected with transcripts derived from either mutant up to 5 days postelectroporation. the full-length clone containing the Y94A mutation (Y94A+N) and the full-length clone containing the Y92A mutation (Q74A+N) were analyzed by electroporation of vero cells. the trans-effects of wild type and mutant N transcripts on rescue of infectious viruses were analyzed by electroporation of vero cells. ates prepared by freezing and thawing of the transfected cells showed no detection of the CPE formation. the mutant N constructs were then used to test if they could facilitate the rescue of the in vitro synthesized full-length IBV transcripts in trans. efficient recovery of infectious virus requires co-transfection of these in vitro transcripts together with the in vitro synthesized RNA covering the N gene. a 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA3 would be expected. a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild-type full-length transcripts at 2 days post-electroporation. total RNA was prepared from vero cells electroporated with in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts 3 days post-electroporation. regions corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal 415 and 1010 nt of the subgenomic mRNA4 and 3, respectively, were amplified by RT\u2013PCR and analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. Lane 1 shows DNA markers and numbers on the left indicate the length of DNA in bases. RT\u2013PCR amplification was performed to check if RNA replication occurred in these transfected cells. the primer pair was chosen so that the IBV sequence from 14 931 to 15 600 nt would be amplified by the RT\u2013PCR. if replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670 bp PCR fragment would be expected. compared to cells transfected with wild-type transcripts, the relative amounts of negative strand RNA were 48, 46 and 50% at 24 h post-electroporation. these figures were dropped to 41, 45 and 23%, respectively, at 48 h post-electroporation. monolayers of vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 l of 1-, 10- and 100-fold diluted virus stock. the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% toluidine. viral stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of the cells three times. expression of S and N proteins was analyzed by western blot. the same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibody. the same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibody. mutated nucleotides (CA-GC) remained stable (Figure 5d) no compensatory mutation was found in other region of the N protein. structural model was partially supported by demonstration that the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein could interact with RNA fragments corresponding to the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome. 10 amino acids were mutated to alanine. these residues are either exposed to the solvent (Gln-74, Arg-76, Lys-78, Lys-81, Tyr-92 and Tyr-94) or have been conserved during evolution. mutation of Asp-111 to an alanine was included as an additional control for the RNA-binding assay. the RNA binding activities of wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by northwestern blot with two probes corresponding to the positive- and negative-sense 3\u2032-UTR of IBV. a moderate decrease in binding to both the positive and negative sense RNA probes was consistently observed with most mutant proteins. a circular dichroism analysis of the two corresponding R76A and Y94A single mutants was performed to check whether the mutant proteins were properly folded. both Arg-76 and Lys-78 to alanine residues reduced the RNA-binding activities to the positive- and negative-sense RNA probes between 44 and 10% of wild-type. results are consistent with the presence of an extended RNA binding site covering a large part of the accessible surface of the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus N protein. vero cells electroporated with in vitro synthesized full-length IBV transcripts. trans-effects of wild type and mutant N transcripts on rescue of infectious viruses. cells electroporated with full-length wild-type IBV transcripts. in cells electroporated with Y92A transcripts, a typical CPE was observed at 2 days post-electroporation. however, prolonged incubation of the transfected cells up to 6 days saw no spread of the infection from the two initiated infected loci to neighboring cells. total RNA was extracted from cells electroporated with wild-type and mutant full-length transcripts. RT\u2013PCR amplification of subgenomic mRNAs was carried out to check whether a low level of RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts. a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild-type full-length transcripts at total RNA was prepared from vero cells electroporated with in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts 3 days post-electroporation. regions corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal 415 and 1010 nt of the subgenomic mRNA4 and 3, respectively, were amplified by RT\u2013PCR and analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. numbers on the left indicate nucleotides in bases. RT\u2013PCR amplification was performed to check if RNA replication occurred in these transfected cells. if replication occurred, a 670 bp PCR fragment would be expected. no corresponding PCR fragment was detected from these samples. results confirm that transcription of negative strand RNA has taken place in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts. the relative amounts of negative strand RNA in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts were 48, 46 and 50%. titers of the mutant virus dropped more rapidly than wild-type virus at 36 and 48 h post-infection. titers of the mutant virus dropped more rapidly than wild-type virus at 36 and 48 h post-infection. numbers on the left indicate nucleotides in kilobase and numbers on the right indicate the genomic and subgenomic RNA species of IBV. western blot analysis of viral protein expression in cells infected with wild type and Q74A mutant viruses. expression of S and N proteins was analyzed by western blot with polyclonal anti-S and anti-actin antibodies. western blot analysis of cells infected with rIBV and Q74A mutant virus showed that more S and N proteins were detected in cells infected with wild-type virus. to confirm if the Q74A mutation is genetically stable during passage of the mutant virus in cells, viral RNA was isolated from cells infected with passage 2 and 5 virus and amplified by RT\u2013PCR. the RNA binding site is capable of accommodating up to 8\u20139 nt bases per N-terminal domain monomer. the Arg-76 and Tyr-94 residues identified in this paper thus provide more precise mapping of the location of the RNA-binding site on the IBV N protein. the protein was shown to be able to facilitate rescue of infectious virus from several coronaviruses by co-electroporation of the in vitro synthesized N transcripts with the in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts (17,28\u201330) the mechanism for this trans-effect is currently unknown. the mutants could promote rescue of the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized IBV RNA as efficiently as did the wild type N transcripts. the second experiment was to introduce the mutant full-length transcripts into cells expressing a six-His-tagged IBV N protein. it failed to rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts in trans. it is unclear if this was due to the low-level expression of N protein in these cells or because the N protein expressed in these cells contains the six-His tag."}
