{"summary": "125 households with at least one member developed symptoms of Influenza-like illness (ILI) three consecutive nasal swabs were collected from each household member (443 individuals) on day 0, 3 and 8 post-ILI report. results Two successive waves of viral infections were identified. several respiratory viruses cause Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILIs) in humans. this includes influenza A (InfA) and B (InfB) viruses, Adenoviruses (ADV), Respiratory Syncytial virus (hRSV), Enteroviruses (EV), Rhinoviruses (hRV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), human Bocavirus (hBoV), human Coronaviruses (hCo only few studies have investigated the full range of respiratory viruses competing for ILIs in the setting of the pH1N1 pandemic [10]\u2013[12]. however, these studies were largely skewed towards symptomatic patients seeking medical support and thus their conclusions are hard to extrapolate for ILIs occurring in the community. nasal swabs were kept at +4\u00b0C until delivery within 24 h. at week 45, the active inquiry was discontinued and a second (post-epidemic) serum sample (sample 2) was obtained. samples were subsequently screened for the presence of Influenza A virus RNA by qRT-PCR using a pan-Influenza A SYBR Green qRT-PCR assay targeting the HA gene [14]. a positive case was defined either as a positive qRT-PCR targeting the pH1N1 HA segment or as a positive qRT-PCR targeting the M gene followed by a confirmatory large fragment sequencing of pH1N1 for HA, NA and M Seeplex 15 viral detection kit contained a pH1N1-specific detection system. it was used to specify pH1N1 cases according to the positive case definition reported above. sensitivity of the system was rather low and we decided not to use it. seroconversion to pH1N1 was defined as a shift from seronegative at inclusion (sample 1: HIA 1/40) to seropositive on follow-up (sample 2: HIA > = 1/40), or, for those sera tested seropositive on inclusion, as a four-fold increase of HIA titers between sample 1 and sample 2 paired sera. age distribution was categorized in four classes (20 yrs, 20\u201339 yr report of ILI (fever 37.8\u00b0C associated with any respiratory or systemic symptom) led to three consecutive visits of a nurse to the incident case-dwelling to record symptoms and collect nasal swabs from all family members in VirocultTM tubes (-Virocult\u00ae, MWE) nucleic acids were extracted from 140 L of swab supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) samples were subsequently screened for the presence of Influenza A virus RNA by qRT-PCR using a pan-Influenza A SYBR Green qRT-PCR assay targeting the HA gene [14] an internal control (DNA plasmid) is included in the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit to identify processed specimens containing substances that interfere with PCR amplification. the internal control is introduced in each amplification reaction and co-amplified with target DNA from the clinical specimen. sensitivity of this additional Seeplex pH1N1 detection was rather low and we decided not to use it. seropositivity was defined as a HIA titer of 1/40 or more as classically recommended. this HIA titer at 1/40 is considered protective, i.e. conferring 50% protection against a viral challenge [20]. pre-epidemic antibody titers > = 1/40 prevented seroconversion to pH1N1. yrs, 20\u201339 yrs, 40\u201359 yrs, 60 yrs, as done previously in the cohort. risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical significance was set at P = 0.05 for all analyses. individuals tested for NIRVs in the coPanFlu-RUN cohort and for the population of Reunion Island. a total of 1196 nasal swabs were analyzed corresponding to 335, 88 and 20 individuals who had three (75.6%), two (19.9%) or two. out of 125 households, pH1N1 virus was found 36 (28.8%) times in at least one nasal swab from at least one household member. all detected InfA viruses were of the pandemic type and no InfB virus was found. out of 443 individuals, 194 (43.8%) had at least one respiratory virus detected. hRV in 62

concerned two and three viruses in 29 and two individuals. co-infections included pH1N1 for only eleven individuals, associated with hRV in four, hCoV in five and hPIV in two. the mean duration (+/SD) of viral shedding was 7.6 (+/3) days for pH1N1, 10.4 (+/5.1) days for hRV, 7.8 (+/3.8) days for hCoV and 9.3 (+/3.2) days for hPIV. we then estimated the duration of viral shedding for pH1N1-NIRVs co-infections among the samples detected positive for any virus. almost half of patients with NIRVs presented URTI (20/62) and one quarter (16/62) had no symptoms. almost half of patients with ILIs were pH1N1 positive, 16.5% had documented NIRVs and 35.3% were negative. we believe either some lack of sensitivity for viral detection or infection by other pathogens. 3 (4.3%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (2.9%) 61

percentages. the passage of the pandemic pH1N1 wave in Reunion Island was very sharp. almost all households (34/36) and all individuals (60/62) positive for pH1N1 were detected. 58 households and 228 individuals were sampled during this epidemic window. human Rhinovirus (hRV, blue), human Coronavirus (hCoV, green), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV, orange), other viruses (pink) co-infections by pH1N1 and NIRVs During W33\u201337, at least one different NIRV co-circulated with pH1N1 in 21 households out of the 34 where the pandemic virus was detected. data were stratified according to the presence or absence of pH1N1 in the 21 households in which more than one virus was detected, NIRVs were significantly more likely to infect pH1N1 negative individuals than pH1N1 positive peers. the mean duration of viral shedding was 7.6 (+/3) days for pH1N1, 10.4 (+/5.1) days for hR. we then estimated the duration of viral shedding for pH1N1-NIRVs co-infections among the samples detected positive for any virus. out of eleven individuals positive for pH1N1 that had evidence of co-infection, the pH1N1 virus was detected in one single swab for seven individuals, in two swabs for two, and in three swabs for two. the duration of viral shedding was significantly shorter in patients with co-infection compared to those almost half of patients with ILIs were pH1N1 positive, 16.5% had documented NIRVs and 35.3% were negative. the proportions of patients who tested negative were 19.5%, 26.2% and 54.8% respectively. URTI (N = 55) 0 (0.0%) 8 (14.6%) 9 (16.4%) 3 (5.4%) 3 (5.4%) 32 (58.2%) asymptomatic. serologic data indicate that the pandemic virus has largely spread among the study population during the epidemic upsurge. the epidemic wave did not last more than 5 weeks (W33\u201337) during which almost all of households and individuals tested positive for pH1N1 were clustered. similar age-related patterns were observed for hRV and \u201cother NIRVs\u201d (hMPV, ADV, hRSV, EV and hBoV), whereas hCoV and hPIV were more evenly distributed over all age groups. the scarcity of RSV and hMPV in our series likely reflects the strong seasonality of these pathogens. the mean total duration of pH1N1 viral shedding in our population-based cohort was estimated at 7.6 (+/3) days for pH1N1, a figure consistent with those reported in the literature among hospitalized or pediatric patients [27]\u2013[30]. Interestingly, when data recorded for pH1N1 and NIRVs were pooled together regardless of the specific virus, the duration of viral shedding was significantly shorter (P = 0.035) the highest seroconversion rate to pH1N1 was observed in the youngest age group. the seroconversion rate to pH1N1 of individuals who tested RT-PCR negative to pH1N1 during W33\u201337 was high and not significantly different from that recorded in individuals who tested RT-PCR positive for NIRVs only. presenting with either ILI or URTI during the upsurge of epidemic (W33\u201337) were virologically documented three times more as pH1N1 positive than as NIRVs positive. this information may help to assess the real burden of pH1N1 during the 2009 pandemic. ized patients lend support for investigating Influenza virus epidemics in perspective broader context that takes into consideration local epidemiological specificities including co-circulating viral respiratory pathogens that have here been highlighted as possible cofactors."}
