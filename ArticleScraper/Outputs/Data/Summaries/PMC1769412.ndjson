{"summary": "a proteomic fingerprint (MR score) was generated from fresh samples of amniotic fluid. all women had a clinically indicated amniocentesis to rule out intra-amniotic infection. high MR scores are associated with preterm delivery, histological chorioamnionitis and early-onset neonatal sepsis. onset sepsis significantly correlated with the MR score even after adjusting for gestational age at birth. the combination of Gram stain and MR score was best for rapid prediction of intra-amniotic infection. researchers identified a set of four protein \u201cmarkers\u201d that were closely associated with inflammation in the amniotic fluid. they developed a score based on those proteins, which they called the \u201cMass Restricted\u201d (MR) score. this score could accurately identify women at risk of preterm delivery. the MR score was closely associated with a number of different indicators of poor outcome in preterm birth. these outcomes included sooner deliveries, sepsis in the baby, and inflammation in the placenta. the researchers then compared the usefulness of the MR score against other potential tests for inflammation. both clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic intrauterine infection induce an intra-amniotic inflammatory response that includes the release of multiple cytokines and chemokines. rapid and accurate recognition of inflammation in utero is critical if targeted interventions to change outcome are to be developed [5\u20137]. amniocentesis was retrieved from 169 consecutive women with singleton pregnancy. each woman was followed prospectively up to the point of delivery. the decision to recommend amniocentesis or delivery of the fetus was made by the primary clinical provider. intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an AF WBC count greater than 100 cells/mm3. in four women, the WBC count could not be reported due to marked cellular destruction secondary to gross bacterial invasion of the AF. a proteomic fingerprint was immediately generated from the fresh AF using a single surface-enhanced laser desorption time-of-flight. the MR score results were not used for clinical management. the remaining AF was centrifuged at 3,000 g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. the remaining AF was stored at 80 \u00b0C until IL-6 and MMP-8 levels were measured. ELISAs for human IL-6 (Pierce-Endogen, http://www.piercenet.com) and MMP-8 (R & D Systems, http://www.rndsystems.com) were performed in duplicate according to manufacturers' instructions by investigators unaware of the sample origin. the minimum detectable concentration for IL-6 was 1 pg/ml and less than 0.02 ng/ml for MMP-8. all neonates underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations of sepsis. clinical indications for early-onset neonatal sepsis included lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, and shock. no patient or AF sample was excluded from the final analysis. a search for intra-amniotic inflammation/infection was made in each sample. no patient or AF sample was excluded from the final analysis. study population and Specimens AF was retrieved by ultrasound-guided amniocentesis from 169 consecutive women with singleton pregnancy following admission at Yale-New Haven Hospital. a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to indicate significance. intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an AF WBC count greater than 100 cells/mm3. a proteomic fingerprint was immediately generated from the fresh AF using a single surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. the MR score provides qualitative information regarding the presence or absence of intra-amniotic inflammation. a categorical value of 1 is assigned if a peak is present and 0 if absent. a score of 3\u20134 indicates the presence of inflammation, whereas a score of 0\u20132 excludes it. one investigator (author IAB) performed all the protein chip array readings and scored all the samples \u201cblindly\u201d. ELISAs for human IL-6 (Pierce-Endogen, http://www.piercenet.com) and MMP-8 (R & D Systems, http://www.rndsystems.com) were performed in duplicate. the minimum detectable concentration for IL-6 was 1 pg/ml and less than 0.02 ng/ml for MMP-8. all neonates underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations of sepsis. clinical indications for early-onset neonatal sepsis included lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, and shock. tal neutrophil ratio (I:T ratio) geater than 0.16, platelet count less than 150,000 cells/mm3 or an abnormal spinal tap. no patient or AF sample was excluded from the final analysis. comparisons between proportions were done with the Chi-square test or Chi-square test for trend (MedCalc) two-by-two contingency tables were constructed and Chi-square analysis of independence was used to identify significant differences among test performances. the phi-coefficient of correlation (), an index of association for binary data, was also calculated. women with positive AF cultures had elevated levels of MMP-8. more women with PPROM had a positive MR score (three or four biomarkers present) five microliters of diluted AF (1:10) was placed in duplicate on spots of H4 ProteinChip arrays. the spots were individually washed three times with 25% acetonitrile solution, air dried, and then overlaid with matrix solution (1 l of 20% saturated solution of -cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid [CHCA] on one array. the SPA chip allows for the identification of defensins 2 (P1: 3,377.01 Da women with \u201csevere\u201d inflammation had shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery intervals. women with \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation had shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery intervals. median time from amniocentesis to delivery in this subgroup was 0.7 d. women with intact membranes had a longer pregnancy duration in absence of inflammation relative to the women with \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation. the percent prolongation among these three groups declined stepwise. four neonates had confirmed sepsis documented through a positive blood culture. neonates delivered from mothers with AF MR 3\u20134 had significantly higher ABC (p 0.001) and I:T ratio (p 0.001) compared to neonates from mothers with MR 0 or MR 1\u20132. the accuracy of an MR score of 3\u20134 was the highest (92.6%), followed by LDH and glucose. a WBC cutoff of greater than 38 cells/mm3 predicts an MR score of 3\u20134. the MR score is actually more precise for the identification of intra-amniotic inflammation compared to the recommended WBC cutoffs. glucose, Gram stain, LDH, IL-6, and MMP-8) were concordant in excluding inflammation in 64.7% of cases. the MR score alone correctly excluded inflammation in 92.4% (p 0.001) of cases. all the other covariates were excluded from the model based on the significance level p > 0.1. none had significant or additive value for prediction of either infection or inflammation. MR scores of 1 and 2 reflect a lesser degree of inflammation. MR 0: 33 [6\u201398] versus MR 1\u20132: 28 [6\u201361] versus MR 3\u20134: 6 [2\u201356] mg/dl, p 0.001. AF median WBC count, ELISA for the IL-6 (C) and MMP-8 levels, and glucose concentration in the same samples varied with the degree of inflammation. the minimum time of incubation required to obtain an accurate spectrum for defensin and calgranulin biomarkers was 15 min. the median time from rupture to amniocentesis in the PPROM group was 9 h (range: 0.5\u2013745.5 h) but the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval was shorter for the PPROM in comparison to the intact group. all but two samples with an MR score of 1 reflected the presence of defensin 2 (P1, Figure 1A) both exceptions had a peak corresponding to calgranulin A (P4) in most instances, an MR of 2 reflected the combination of defensin 1 and 2 and calgranulin C (P3). this suggests a sequential appearance of the biomarkers in women with intra-amniotic inflammation/infection. the SPA chip allows for the identification of defensins 2 (P1: 3,377.01 Da) and 1 (P2: 3,448.09 Da) the x-axis of the tracings represents the molecular mass in Daltons. the y-axis represents the relative peak intensity. nineteen women had MR scores of 3\u20134, but were managed expectantly by the clinical provider. median time from amniocentesis to delivery in this subgroup was 0.7 d [0.0\u201349.6 d], which was not significantly different from that of the subgroup of women with MR 3\u20134 managed with indicated delivery (p = 0.73). the percent prolongation among these three groups declined stepwise. the presence and severity of acute inflammation in the chorionic plate, amnion, chorio-decidua, and umbilical cord were significantly associated with the occurrence and the degree of intra-amniotic inflammation as determined by the MR score. neonates from mothers with MR 0 or MR 1\u20132 were associated significantly with an MR 3\u20134 (Chi-square = 8.270, = 0.305, p = 0.004). the MR score maintained this association when adjusted for GA at birth. MR score was originally designed to predict intra-amniotic inflammation (WBC > 100 cells/mm3). a WBC cutoff of greater than 38 cells/mm3 predicts an MR score of 3\u20134. the MR score is actually more precise for the identification of intra-amniotic inflammation compared to the recommended WBC cutoffs. wise logistic regression analysis found that the MR score performed better than any test or combination of tests (OR: 136.0 [95% CI, 42.0 to 632.3], p 0.0001) followed by LDH (OR: 70.6 [95% CI, 20.7 to 240.7], p 0.0001) when all covariates were entered into the model, only the MR score and LDH had a significant relationship with intra-amniotic inflammation. AF inflammation is thought to be an important risk factor for neonatal morbidity and mortality. we tested the relationships between the MR score, the WBC count, IL-6 and MMP-8 levels, and glucose concentration. we found that women with MR 3\u20134 had higher numbers of WBCs. MR scores are associated with preterm delivery, histological chorioamnionitis, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. results of this study indicate that proteomic profiling of the amniotic fluid is an accurate method for diagnosis of clinically relevant intra-amniotic inflammation. clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis is an insensitive measure of the presence of inflammation, infection, or fetal sepsis. but direct analysis of the AF remains the most accurate and direct method to assess for the presence or absence of intra-amniotic inflammation and infection. teomic profiling alone was able to correctly confirm or exclude inflammation in over 90% of our samples. compared the diagnostic performance of the MR score against glucose, WBC count, LDH, IL-6, and MMP-8 by using the clinical laboratory cutoffs previously reported in the literature. further studies need to be done to re-evaluate prospectively the cutoffs currently used by the clinicians to best diagnose intra-amniotic inflammation and infection. we found that the components of a given MR score are not random, but recurrent and sequential. the initial phase of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response is characterized by the appearance of defensins. the median WBC count for the group of women with \u201cminimal\u201d inflammation was extremely low (six cells/mm3) in support of the proteomic profile, early-onset neonatal sepsis was associated significantly with an MR 3\u20134, but not with the AF WBC count. despite this, the presence of biomarkers characteristic of intra-amniotic inflammation is related to the presence and the degree of acute histological inflammation at delivery. accession numbers for the proteins discussed in this paper are as follows. calgranulin A (P05109), calgranulin C (P80511), and neutrophil defensin-1 and neutrophil defensin-2 (P59665)"}
