{"summary": "HRSV is the leading cause of severe respiratory tract infections in newborn children worldwide (1). it infects almost all infants within the first 2 years of life and is the main cause of infant bronchiolitis. only ribavirin is approved for therapeutic treatment. roles include involvement in the formation of virus factories (7, 8) and acting directly as cofactors to regulate RdRp activity (9, 10). expression and purification of the L-protein (with the P-protein) from insect cells previously suggested an association with HSP70 (11), and data from coimmunoprecipitation studies suggested that HSP70 associates with the P-protein alone (12). the activity of the replicon can be monitored via the expression of a reporter protein, such as luciferase. the EGFP moiety allows the use of a highly specific, single-chain antibody to EGFP to facilitate detection or purification of either the EGFP-L or the EGFP-P protein in the context of the minireplicon system. HEp2 and A549 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM. BSRT7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin. bacterial titers were calculated as previously described. cell monolayers were cotransfected with 12.5 g of pN, 12.5 g of pP or pP-EGFP, 6.25 g of pL or pL-EGFP, and 12.5 g of pM2-1 plasmids. the bead pellet was washed and suspended in 50 l of glycine elution buffer (0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5) oacetic acid (TFA) was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 60 min (4\u00b0C) to remove precipitated Rapigest. Peptides were concentrated and desalted using C18 Stage tips. then dried using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (Jouan) and resuspended in a 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA. tra were acquired in the LTQ ion trap. runs were time aligned using default settings. peaks were picked by the software and filtered to include only a charge state of +2 and +6. after 17-AAG treatment, MTT powder (Sigma) was dissolved in DMEM. medium was aspirated, and the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. cultures were thoroughly mixed by pipetting until MTT was reduced to purple formazan in living cells. a dose-response curve was then produced to assess cell viability. cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] NP-40 alternative, 0.5% [wt/vol] sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) supplemented with 1 EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture per 50 ml buffer and immunoblotted with an antibody to Cdc2 ( the lysolecithin/PBS mix was aspirated, and cells from each well were scraped into 62 l of transcription buffer. the cell extract was combined with additional transcription buffer containing 10 Ci. total and RNase H-treated RNA samples were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. the RNA signal was quantified by analyzing TIF images by using Quantity One software. a standard curve was generated by preparing a 2-fold dilution series of a molecular weight marker. RNA products were visualized and quantified by phosphorimage scanning and Quantity One software. confocal microscopy images were captured on an LSM510 META microscope. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system. twenty microliters of cDNA product was then diluted with 80 l of nuclease-free water. luciferase-based or incomplete (L) luciferase-based or incomplete (L) luciferase-based HRSV minireplicon reporter plasmid system 4 h prior to drug treatment. lysate (20 l) was pipetted into a 96-well white flat-bottom plate. luminescent signal was recorded using a luminescence reader. cells were defined based on forward and side scatter. cells were plotted against side scatter and FL1 for GFP expression. hep2 and A549 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM. BSRT7 cells were seeded in two 10-cm2 dishes per condition. they were 90% confluent prior to transfection. cell monolayers were cotransfected with 12.5 g of pN. -grade trypsin was added at a protein:trypsin ratio of 50:1. samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 60 min (4\u00b0C) to remove precipitated Rapigest. the gradient consisted of 3 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 90 min. the top 20 most intense ions from the MS1 scan (full MS) were selected for tandem MS by collision-induced dissociation (CID), and all product spectra were acquired in the LTQ ion trap. thermo RAW files were imported into Progenesis LC-MS (version 4.1; Nonlinear Dynamics) 3.8 103 cells/well (for 40 to 50% confluence), 1 104 cells/well (for 60 to 70% confluence), or 1.5 104 cells/well (for 80 to 90% confluence) following 17-AAG treatment, MTT powder (Sigma) was dissolved in DMEM (plus 10% [vol/vol] FBS) at 37\u00b0C to make a 10 mM solution and filtered through a 0.2-m filter. medium was aspirated, and the cell pellets were processed 22 h post-virus application or minireplicon transfection and 18 h post-17-AAG treatment. to assess 17-AAG activity, cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] NP-40 alternative, 0.5% [wt/vol] sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS the medium was replaced with medium containing 2 g/ml actinomycin D. cells from each well were scraped into 62 l of transcription buffer. lysolecithin/PBS mix was aspirated, and cells from each well were scraped. total and RNase H-treated RNA samples were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and analyzed by autoradiography. the RNA signal was quantified by analyzing TIF images of the autoradiograms by using Quantity One software. the RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. the molecular weight ladder was generated by alkali hydrolysis of a 32P-end-labeled RNA oligonucleotide representing the anticipated RNA products. RNA products were visualized and quantified by phosphorimage scanning and Quantity One software. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system. twenty microliters of cDNA product was then diluted with 80 l of nuclease-free water. BSRT7 cells were transfected with the complete (+L) luciferase-based or incomplete (L) luciferase-based HRSV minireplicon reporter plasmid system 4 h prior to drug treatment. lysate (20 l) was pipetted into a 96-well white flat-bottom plate and assayed using the dual luciferase system. Flow cytometry analysis of EGFP-ADAR1 genes was performed on a FACSCalibur apparatus and using CellQuest software. data analysis was performed using FlowJo (version X.0.7; Tree Star Inc.) label-free quantitative proteomics was used to compare the abundance of immunoprecipitated peptides from this system with the abundance of those precipitated from a control sample. both EGFP-L and -P and the untagged control were purified independently in triplicate, and each eluted sample was further analyzed. the binding ratio refers to the relative quantification when comparing the tagged replicon system to the untagged control. the binding ratio refers to the relative quantification when comparing the tagged replicon system to the untagged control and is expressed as the fold change. the binding ratio refers to the relative quantification when comparing the tagged replicon system to the untagged control. proteins involved in chaperone activity formed a major part of the EGFP-L interactome. a volcano plot identified proteins of interest, which are displayed as large-magnitude ratio changes (x axis) and high statistical significance (y axis) there was less luciferase observed in the experimental system. expression of N, P, and M2-1 from the support plasmids was confirmed. luciferase was below the limit of detection in the bound fraction. strain-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1; ratio, 15.5) and HSP90 (ratio, 8.5) were precipitated in greater quantities from the experimental system than the control precipitation. this was in line with previous observations that chaperone proteins associate with the binding matrix in an IP (29), but in the absence of a specific interaction, they generally have a binding ratio of 1.0 or less. LC-MS/MS analysis of EGFP-P IP identified both N and L. M2-1 was also identified, but again, only with a single peptide. cellular polypeptides involved in chaperone function were prominent. the activity of the inhibitor was confirmed at higher doses by the depletion of Cdc2 (Fig. 3A), a protein whose abundance is dependent on HSP90 chaperone activity. however, as the concentration of 17-AAG increased, there was a marked dose-dependent decrease in the abundance of viral proteins. this was mirrored by a corresponding decrease in all viral mRNA species in HRSV-infected cells treated with 17-AAG. each viral transcript was compared by qRT-PCR at 22 h p.i. qRT-PCR revealed an approximately 5-fold decrease in the amount of luciferase mRNA in replicon-expressing cells treated with 0.5 M 17-AAG compared to the amount of luciferase mRNA in replicon-expressing cells. the levels of P, N, and M2-1 expressed from the support plasmids were unchanged in the absence or presence of 17-AAG. however, immunoblot analysis indicated that the levels of P, N, and M2-1 expressed from the support plasmids were unchanged in the absence or presence of 17-AAG. this inhibits the process of viral gene expression but not by destabilizing all virus polypeptides. 17-AAG treatment 4 h posttransfection inhibited viral mRNA synthesis. but the anti-HRSV polyclonal antibody used did not detect the L-protein. the EGFP-L could be readily detected, showing a punctate cytoplasmic distribution reminiscent of the cytoplasmic IBs. 17-AAG treatment reduced the expression of the EGFP-L protein, but not that of other EGFP-tagged proteins, indicating the effect was specific to the L-protein domain. no L-EGFP protein was visualized in minireplicon-expressing cells treated with 17-AAG. BSRT7 cells were pulse-labeled 24 h posttransfection with [35S]methionine. cells were either harvested immediately (t = 0) or chased with medium containing excess of cold methionine for 2 h at 37\u00b0C (t = 2). EGFP-tagged proteins were isolated from cell lysates by using EGFP-Trap beads. EGFP-P and ADAR1 proteins showed a slight increase in degradation at 2 h postchase in response to 17-AAG treatment. EGFP-L was also the least stable protein in the absence of 17-AAG. blocking HSP90 chaperone function directly destabilizes L protein, independently of P. luciferase activity decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of PIF and VER. however, when cell viability was assessed by measuring intracellular ATP levels, both drugs were clearly toxic at 50 M and above. the actions of these inhibitors were also evaluated in HRSV-infected A549 cells. no viral polypeptides were detected in mock-infected cells as expected. cellular GAPDH levels remained constant across the drug concentrations tested. against HSP70 inhibited lipid raft-associated HRSV polymerase activity (13) more recent studies have shown that HSP70 copurifies with heterologously expressed HRSV L/P complexes (11) these findings suggest that HSP70 binds to the HRSV L/P complex and affects polymerase activity. the findings indicated that HSP70 is required for, or augments, HRSV polymerase activity on an intact nucleocapsid template. Lane 1, RNA from a reaction mixture containing mock-infected cell extracts, with [-32P]GTP as the labeled NTP and various concentrations of VER included in the reaction mixture. asterisk indicates the RNA band that was quantified to generate the graph in panel C. synthesis in the minimalist RNA synthesis assay involving purified L/P/HSP70 complexes based on quantification of the 21-nucleotide band marked with an asterisk in panel B. the data from each experiment were normalized to the level of labeled RNA produced in the absence of VER, which was set to a value of 1. HSP70 activity does not affect the HRSV polymerization activity of the L/P complex per se. IP coupled with quantitative proteomics was used to identify potential interacting partners of the HRSV polymerase complex. LC-MS/MS analysis of the IP proteins was conducted on material eluted in 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5. both EGFP-L and -P and the untagged control were purified independently in triplicate, and each eluted sample was further analyzed in triplicate. the binding ratio refers to the relative quantification when comparing the tagged replicon system to the untagged control and is expressed as the fold change. the binding ratio refers to the relative quantification when comparing the tagged replicon system to the untagged control and is expressed as the fold change. protein binding to the beads equally in both control and test samples will have a binding ratio near 1.0. proteins involved in chaperone function formed a major part of the EGFP-L interactome. control and experimental samples (performed in triplicate) were each processed in triplicate by LC-MS/MS. expression of luciferase from the control and experimental system was confirmed via immunoblotting with a probe for an anti-RSV antibody. luciferase was below the limit of detection in the immunoprecipitated (bound) fraction, as expected. strain-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1; ratio, 15.5) and HSP90 (ratio, 8.5) were precipitated in greater quantities from the experimental system than the control precipitation. the mini-replicon system required the stable expression of the L-protein together with the N-, P-, and M2-1-proteins to generate a functional RNP that mimicked those found in infected cells (17). LC-MS/MS analysis of EGFP-P IP identified both N and L. M2-1 was also identified, but again, only with a single peptide. cellular polypeptides involved in chaperone function were prominent. the activity of the inhibitor was confirmed at higher doses by the depletion of Cdc2 (Fig. 3A), a protein whose abundance is dependent on HSP90 chaperone activity (13). however, as the concentration of 17-AAG increased, there was a marked dose-dependent decrease in the abundance of viral proteins. this was mirrored by a corresponding decrease in all viral mRNA species in HRSV-infected cells treated with 17-AAG. 0.5 M 17-AAG was added at 4 h p.i. in the presence or absence of 0.5 M. qRT-PCR revealed an approximately 5-fold decrease in the amount of luciferase mRNA in replicon-expressing cells treated with 0.5 M 17-AAG. the levels of P, N, and M2-1 expressed from the support plasmids were unchanged in the absence or presence of 17-AAG. the L-protein could not be detected due to the lack of a specific antibody. thus, 17-AAG inhibits the process of viral gene expression but not by destabilizing all virus polypeptides. ed viral mRNA synthesis but did not affect the accumulation of the P-, N-, and M2-1-proteins expressed from support plasmids. anti-HRSV polyclonal antibody used the EGFP-L protein as a detection tag. in the absence of 17-AAG, the EGFP-L could be readily detected. the fluorescence of EGFP-ADAR1 was used as an irrelevant control. thus, 17-AAG treatment reduced the expression of the EGFP-L protein, but not that of other EGFP-tagged proteins. no L-EGFP protein was visualized in cells treated with 17-AAG. nontreated and 17-AAG-treated cells were pulse-labeled 24 h posttransfection with [35S]methionine for 30 min. either harvested immediately (t = 0) or chased with medium containing an excess of cold methionine for 2 h at 37\u00b0C (t = 2). EGFP-tagged proteins were isolated from cell lysates. EGFP-L was undetectable in 17-AAG-treated cells. EGFP-L was also the least stable protein in the absence of 17-AAG. blocking HSP90 chaperone function directly destabilizes L protein, independently of P. four inhibitors of HSP70 chaperone function (PIF, VER, MKT-077, and YM-1) had an effect on viral gene expression. luciferase activity decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of PIF and VER. no viral polypeptides were detected in mock-infected cells as expected. cellular GAPDH levels remained constant across the drug concentrations tested. VER caused a dose-dependent decrease in viral protein accumulation compared to the untreated or vehicle control. more recent studies have shown that HSP70 copurifies with heterologously expressed HRSV L/P complexes (11) these findings suggest that HSP70 binds to the HRSV L/P complex and affects polymerase activity. this is consistent with the EGFP-Trap results. addition of VER inhibits HRSV mRNA synthesis in a cell extract in vitro. Lane 1, RNA from a reaction mixture containing mock-infected cell extracts. lanes 2 to 6, RNA from a reaction mixture containing HRSV-infected cell extracts, with [-32P]GTP as the labeled NTP. ified L/P/HSP70 complexes were incubated with a naked RNA oligonucleotide, containing nucleotides 1 to 25 of the trailer-complement (trc) promoter sequence, in buffer containing NTPs, including [-32P]GTP. in the absence of VER, we analyzed HRSV polymerase activity in a minimalist in vitro RNA synthesis assay. inclusion of VER in the reaction mixtures had no detectable effect on RNA synthesis. this result showed that HSP70 activity does not affect the HRSV polymerization activity of the L/P complex per se. insertion of EGFP open reading frame into either polypeptide reduced transcriptional activity in the minireplicon system compared to the native HRSV L- or P-proteins. this diminution of transcription activity or altered phenotype is commonly found for the insertion of additional ORFs in other RdRps. however, the use of tagged viral proteins that still maintained biological activity in the cell was advantageous in comparison to similar systems in which biological activity was not or could not be established. expression of EGFP-L in isolation allowed us to perform kinetic analyses of protein expression and stability in the absence and presence of the P-protein cofactor. expression of EGFP-L in isolation allowed us to perform kinetic analyses of protein expression and stability in the absence and presence of the P-protein cofactor. a similar hypothesis was proposed by Connor et al. VER affected both replicon activity and protein synthesis in HRSV-infected cells. this suggests a positive role for HSP70 in replication of viral RNA. VER had no detectable effect in a minimalist assay involving purified recombinant L- and P-proteins in complex with HSP70. HSP70 may be involved in nucleocapsid remodeling for negative-strand RNA viruses. but it may accomplish this role by binding different proteins within the nucleocapsid complex, depending on the virus. it is possible that relatively lower HSP70 activity promotes nucleocapsid restructuring. the general approach of using quantitative proteomics to identify cellular proteins that are critical for virus biology may open up new avenues of therapeutic intervention. this illustrates the versatility of targeting cellular proteins, rather than viral proteins."}
