{"summary": "noroviruses are the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide (1, 2). the disease is relatively mild and self-limiting. morbidity and mortality due to norovirus infection are a concern for young children and immunocompromised individuals. studies with other viruses have identified a fine balance between fidelity and viral fitness. the disease burdens associated with norovirus are regulated in part by a poorly understood process of recombination, continual evolution, and emergence of novel norovirus strains that circulate in human populations. full-genome analysis identified NS4 and VP1 as the most positively selected genes in the norovirus genome. we tested for convergent sites between the immunocompromised and the circulating populations to determine similar evolutionary trends. new Orleans-positive specimen collected from an immunocompetent patient in a cruise ship outbreak in 2010 was processed concurrently to determine process-induced or naturally occurring polymorphisms. IC, immunocompetent patient infected with GII.4 new Orleans; UNK1, novel, unknown GII.4 norovirus variant 1; UNK2, novel, unknown GII.4 norovirus variant 2. a 2.3-kbp fragment from VP1 and part of VP2 were amplified using GII norovirus conserved primers Ring2-PCR and panGIIR (37). ten clones from each specimen, a total of 50 RNA from intact virions was reverse transcribed, purified, and amplified. RNA was reverse transcribed with superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using random hexamers with a unique barcode. double-stranded DNA synthesized by Klenow reaction. a total of 10 clones from each specimen for a total of 50 clones were selected and bidirectionally sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic tree for VP1 of each specimen was built in PhyML 3.0 using the general time-reversible model. sBP (single likelihood ancestor counting), iFEL (internal fixed-effect likelihood), FEL (fixed-effect likelihood) and MEME (mixed-effect model of evolution) were run on a subset of VP1 to determine the best model. 240 publicly available GII.4 norovirus sequences (S1) were run using the four available methods SLAC (single-likelihood ancestor counting), iFEL (internal fixed-effect likelihood), FEL (fixed-effect likelihood), and MEME (mixed-effect model of evolution) the P values from the four methods (S2) were graphed for comparison. the number of mutations was obtained from the next-generation data and selective sites obtained from DataMonkey. the randomization was repeated 1,000 times, and data from each iteration were collected and graphed. the fourth specimen (A + 5) was collected from patient A 5 months after the first sample. an immunocompetent patient in a cruise ship outbreak in 2010 was processed concurrently to determine process-induced or naturally occurring polymorphisms. nisolone, tacrolimus, basiliximab, cyclosporine a IC, immunocompetent patient infected with GII.4 new Orleans; UNK1, novel, unknown GII.4 norovirus variant 1; UNK2, novel, unknown GII.4 norovirus variant 2. the VP1 and partial VP2 regions were amplified and cloned using previously described methods. virus pellet was resuspended in PBS and treated with DNase Turbo, Benzonase, and RNase One for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. RNA was reverse transcribed, purified, and amplified as described elsewhere. a total of 10 clones from each specimen for a total of 50 clones were selected and bidirectionally sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic tree for VP1 of each specimen was built in PhyML 3.0 using the general time-reversible model (GTR) GII.4 noroviruses were parsed and analyzed for each gene. potential recombination was assayed using SBP (single breakpoint) in Hyphy (http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/Main_Page) the data were parsed appropriately if a breakpoint was detected. four methods were compared to determine the most appropriate statistical method to determine positive selection. the VP1 gene was parsed from 240 publicly available GII.4 norovirus sequences (S1) and run using the four available methods SLAC (single-likelihood ancestor counting), iFEL (internal fixed-effect likelihood), FEL (fixed effect likelihood), and MEME (mixed-effect model of evolution) a uniform distribution was used to sample the location of the sites. the number of mutations was obtained from the next-generation data. the randomization was repeated 1,000 times. gene meME analysis results No. of variables sites determined by deep sequencing No. of selected sites Proportion of selected sites by gene size Specimen A Specimen B Specimen C Unique sites N terminus (NS1-2) 18 0.05 21 7 3 28 VP1 31 0.06 54 22 4 75 P20 (NS4) 11 0.06 30 9 0 38 NTPase (NS3) 15 0.04 28 7 1 36 VPg (NS5) 2 0.02 14 1 0 15 Protease the mutation frequencies were 1.8 103 and 6.2 104 substitution per site for each variant in the patient. the mutation frequency for the immunocompetent specimen could not be determined because it did not contain any nucleotide substitutions among the 10 clones recovered. fifty clones, 10 per specimen, were selected and bidirectionally sequenced. the major capsid protein for all sequences along with known GII.4 variants was run in PhyML. the sequences of the clones were clustered phylogenetically, and all nucleotide sequences were translated. a total of 113 positively selected codon sites were identified by MEME analysis with a P value score of 0.1. the VP1 gene had the highest number of positively selected sites, 31, whereas the NS6 and NS5 were the most conserved. the NS7 contained one of the lowest proportions of selected sites. a total of 317 sites throughout the norovirus genome were available for analysis after discarding minimal or spurious mutations. 301 were unique among the three specimens (Table 2 and Fig. 5). NS5, NS3 and NS6 genes contained the lowest proportions of mutations by gene size, 0.01 to 0.04. only the NS4 gene had a statistically significant (P 0.001) number of mutations. VP1 (P = 0.22), NS7 (P = 0.37), and NS5 (P = 0.75) genes did not have significant numbers of mutations. NS1-2 (P = 0.03), NS3 (P = 0.024), and NS6 (P = 0.002) genes had significantly fewer mutations. the difference between all sites was calculated based on previous GII.4 variants. residue changes occur within 0 to 2 amino acids of positively selected sites. the minimum difference or nearest site between any two sites was binned into a series of amino acid distance groups. a hypergeometric test was run over the entire norovirus genome. it took into account mutations by distance, number of positive selected sites, genome size, and total number of polymorphic sites. the results of the hypergeometric test were similar to the RNA virus population data from the immunocompromised people. s around selective sites become rapidly saturated with genetic polymorphisms. increasing the number of mutations does not provide an increase in positively selective site changes. mutations occurring >4 amino acids away from positively selected sites will have little effect. the deletion at aa 298 had not been previously identified in any GII.4 variant known to date. the average mutation frequencies of VP1 based on a VP1 of 1,620 nt were 6.6 102, 3.0 102, and 6.2 104 substitution per site in the GII.4 major capsid protein. seven of the 50 clones had a premature stop codon at the end of the S domain. a subset (*) were found to have premature stop codons. most of the deletion mutants in patient A were nearly identical to the deletion mutants found 5 months after the first sample. mutations in VP1 were clustered by domain, each domain was analyzed separately. the nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios for the P1 and S domains were less than 1, indicating overall negative selection pressure. a total of 317 sites throughout the norovirus genome were available for analysis after discarding minimal or spurious mutations. a total of 317 sites throughout the norovirus genome were available for analysis after discarding minimal or spurious mutations. NS5, NS3, and NS6 genes contained the lowest proportions of mutations by gene size, 0.01 to 0.04. the NS4 gene had a statistically significant (P 0.001) number of mutations. only the NS4 gene had a statistically significant (P 0.001) number of mutations. 1 bits were at positions 204, 239, and 280, NS4 at positions 29, 88, and 174, NS6 at positions 35, and NS7 at codons 231, 291, and 365. a breakdown by gene indicated that NS3, NS4, VP1 and VP2 had a variable to selective site distribution similar to that of the complete norovirus genome. a hypergeometric test was run over the entire norovirus genome. it took into account mutations by distance, number of positive selected sites, genome size, and total number of polymorphic sites. the results of the randomized site simulation were similar to the RNA virus population data from the immunocompromised people. the proportions of polymorphic sites within 0 to 2 amino acids of selective sites were nearly identical, 0.206 and 0.202 for the immunocompromised patients and simulated data, respectively. the results show that as mutations increase, the residues around the selective sites become rapidly saturated with genetic polymorphisms. the presence of these variants indicates that there may be a much larger pool of GII.4 noroviruses circulating in human populations than is captured by routine outbreak surveillance. these patients may serve as reservoirs of novel norovirus variants based on the random nature of mutations and the patients' lack of a fully functioning immune system. positively selective sites encompass 535 residues within 0 to 2 amino acids of the 113 identified in this study. the positively selective sites encompass 535 residues within 0 to 2 amino acids of the 113 identified in this study. previous studies have shown that immunocompromised people shed antigenically distinct viruses over time. the NS4 in GI.1 has an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signal and is involved in Golgi disassembly. MNV has no effect on the Golgi and lacks the ER export signal. the significance of this difference is currently unknown. norovirus-infected patients can be potential reservoirs for novel norovirus strains by the presence of two novel GII.4 variant viruses. most mutations occurred within 0 to 2 amino acids of selective sites. this was a function of genome size and the number of selective sites and not specific clustering."}
