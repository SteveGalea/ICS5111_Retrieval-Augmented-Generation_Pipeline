{"summary": "a previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from a patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia (1, 2). the virus, now known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (3), has been contracted by hundreds of others in geographically distinct locations in the Middle East. studies into the complex genome, proteome, and replication cycle of coronaviruses were intensified. the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic was controlled within a few months after its onset. however, the interest in anticoronavirus drug development has been limited, until the emergence of MERS-CoV. mixed results were reported from studies in different cell lines, animal models, and patients. for MERS-CoV, partial ribavirin sensitivity was observed in cell culture and in a macaque animal model. however, in a small-scale clinical trial, this combination therapy did not benefit critically ill MERS patients. eramide, and lopinavir were found to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. these compounds appear to be broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitors. they blocked the replication of human coronavirus 229E and SARS-CoV with comparable efficacy. all work with live MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was performed inside biosafety cabinets in biosafety level 3 facilities. a library of 348 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA) the cytotoxic effects of compound treatment were monitored in parallel plates. for validation experiments, we separately reordered chlorpromazine (CPZ; S2456; SelleckChem), lopinavir (LPV; ABT-378; SelleckChem), and loperamide (LPM; S2480; SelleckChem), which were dissolved in DMSO. for all compounds, 20 mM stock solutions were stored at 20\u00b0C as aliquots for single the relative efficacy of a compound in specifically inhibiting viral replication (as opposed to inducing cytopathic side effects) was defined as the selectivity index (SI; calculated as CC50/EC50) Statistical analyses were performed using the results of at least two independent experiments. infection of vero and Huh7 cells with MERS-CoV (strain Frankfurt-1 [48]) were done as described before (34) a library of 348 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Compound stocks were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. each well was given 50 l of compound dilution. chlorpromazine (CPZ; S2456; SelleckChem), lopinavir (LPV; ABT-378; SelleckChem), loperamide (LPM; S2480; SelleckChem), and chloroquine (CQ; C6628; Sigma) were dissolved in DMSO. for all compounds, 20 mM stock solutions were stored at 20\u00b0C as aliquots for single use. RESULTS Screening for FDA-approved compounds with anti-MERS-CoV activity. a primary library screen was performed using a set of 348 FDA-approved drugs. the primary screen resulted in the identification of 11 hits that showed at least 50% inhibition of virus-induced CPE in the absence of cytotoxicity. another reported inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (56), chlorpromazine (CPZ), was also found to inhibit MERS-CoV-induced CPE (EC50, 4.9 M; SI, 4.3) with a 12 M dose achieving complete inhibition (Fig. 1B and Table 1). a maximum of 82% inhibition was observed at 8 M, a concentration that was not cytotoxic in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells in 96-well plates were infected with MERS-CoV isolate EMC/2012 (MOI, 0.005) in the presence of 0 to 32 M CQ (A), 0 to 16 M CPZ (B), 0 to 8 M LPM (C), or 0 to 20 M LPV (D). cell viability was monitored using an MTS assay. antiviral activity was determined in Huh7 cells (for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E-GFP) or VeroE6 cells (for SARS-CoV) all four compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-induced CPE in a dose-dependent manner. low-micromolar amounts of chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir inhibit SARS-CoV-induced cytopathology. vero E6 cells in 96-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt-1 (MOI, 0.005) in the presence of 0 to 32 M CQ (A), 0 to 16 M CPZ (B), 0 to 32 M LPM (C), or 0 to 32 HCoV-229E-GFP replication is inhibited by low-micromolar amounts of chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir. cells were infected with HCoV-229E-GFP (MOI, 5) in the presence of 0 to 50 M CQ (A), CPZ (B), LPM (C), or LPV (D) treatment with 16 M LPM in Vero cells reduced virus production by 2 log when added prior to infection, while a 1-log reduction was observed when LPM was added at 1 h p.i. a modest effect (0.5- to 1-log reduction) was observed when added at 1 h p.i., suggesting that the compound may also affect MERS-CoV infection at a postentry stage. 1 or +1, the indicated concentrations of CQ (A, B), CPZ (C, D), LPM (E, F) and LPV (G, H) were added, and virus titers in the culture supernatant were determined at 24 h p.i. using plaque assays; n.d., not detected. primary library screen was performed using 348 FDA-approved drugs. ine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir inhibit MERS-CoV replication. four compounds were selected for further validation. another reported inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was also found to inhibit MERS-CoV-induced CPE. low-micromolar amounts of chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir inhibit MERS-CoV-induced cytopathology. cells were infected with 0 to 32 M CQ (A), 0 to 16 M CPZ (B), 0 to 8 M LPM (C) or 0 to 20 M LPV (D) 4.3 8.8 ( 1.0) 24.3 ( 1.1) 2.8 2.5 ( 1.0) 23.5 ( 1.0) 9.4 Loperamide 4.8 ( 1.5) 15.5 ( 1.0) 3.2 5.9 ( 1.1) 53.8 ( 1.1) 5.9 ( 1.1) 9.1 4.0 ( 1.1) 25.9 ( 1.0) 6.0 Lopinavir 8.0 ( 1.5) 24.4 ( 1.1) 3.1 17.1 ( 1.0) >32 >2 6.6 ( 1.1) LPV completely blocked SARS-CoV-induced CPE at 12 M, with an EC50 of 8.0 M. low-micromolar amounts of chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir inhibit SARS-CoV-induced cytopathology. HCoV-229E-GFP replication is inhibited by low-micromolar amounts of chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir. CPZ, LPM, and LPV inhibited replication with EC50s of 2.5 M (SI, 9.4), 4.2 M (SI, 6.0), and 6.6 M (SI, 5.7), respectively. titers were added to cells 1 h before (t = 1) or after (t = +1) infection (MOI, 1). Virus production was not affected by CQ treatment when the compound was added at 1 h p.i. however, when added prior to infection, 16 and 32 M concentrations of CQ induced an 1-log and 2-log reduction in virus production. the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak has made it painfully clear that our current options for treatment of life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans are very limited. at present, no drug is available for the treatment of any of the human or zoonotic coronaviruses (reviewed in reference 58) a cell culture-based screening assay found compounds that inhibit in vitro replication of MERS-CoV at low-micromolar concentrations. the same four drugs were also found to inhibit in vitro replication of two other coronaviruses, i.e., HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. the accumulation of CQ in the milk glands, resulting in high drug concentrations in maternal milk, was a major factor in reaching a sufficiently high concentration of the drug in blood plasma. however, this was not attributed to a direct antiviral effect but likely due to the immunomodulatory properties of CQ. CPZ plasma concentrations in patients treated for psychotic disorders range between 0.3 and 3 M (73), which is somewhat below the observed EC50s. replication of MERS-CoV in vitro was also inhibited by LPM, an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist. plasma (8 to 24 M) that have been observed in AIDS patients (76) LPV was previously shown to block the SARS-CoV main protease (24) this is somehow unexpected, since the retro- and coronavirus proteases belong to different protease families. however, several anti-HIV PIs are also known to influence intracellular pathways leading to side effects in patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy. despite some practical limitations, this model may provide a useful starting point for further evaluation of inhibitors of MERS-CoV infection. in 2003, the 10% mortality rate among SARS patients was one of the major reasons for the worldwide public unrest caused by the emergence of SARS-CoV. in-depth mechanism of action studies will include resistance development of MERS-CoV against the compounds identified. the efficacy of combinations of two or more of these drugs will be explored, also in combination with interferon."}
