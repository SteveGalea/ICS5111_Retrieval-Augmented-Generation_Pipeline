{"summary": "bats are reservoirs of many emerging and reemerging zoonotic viruses. the emerging viruses exert a significant public health threat. they include ebolaviruses, henipaviruses, lyssaviruses and coronaviruses. despite abundance and potential role of bats in disease transmission, viruses harbored by bats remain mostly underexplored. surveillance of coVs in bat species is necessary to better predict and prevent the next emergence of a CoV disease outbreak. glutamine (GibcoTM GlutaMAX, Fisher Scientific, Cat# 35050-061), antibiotics (50 g/mL penicillin, 50 g/mL streptomycin, 100 g/mL neomycin) were cleared of debris by low-speed centrifugation (5 min at 1500 g) the supernatants filtered through 0.45 m PVDF, sterile filters (Fisher Scientific, Cat# 09-720-4) to remove bacteria and viral RNA was denatured at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor. cDNA synthesis was performed with Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen, Cat# 205111) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C using primer CorTheoNL63R1 (5\u2032-CCRTCATCAGANAGAATCAT-3\u2032) re-amplified samples were electrophoresed in a 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. the purified 440 bp amplicons were then subjected to Sanger Sequencing. preliminary sequence analyses were performed with the NCBI BLAST software. the sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega [32] and manually edited in Bioedit [33] 440 bp amplicons corresponding to a conserved region of the CoV RdRp gene were generated by RT-PCR from two filtered homogenates. the consensus RdRp sequence was found to be highly similar but not identical to alphacoronavirus sequences identified in Brazilian free-tailed bats. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the RdRp gene sequence that had been RT-PCR-amplified from the feces of free-tailed bats in Florida clusters with RdRp gene sequences from two different types of bats in Brazil (Figure 2). the maximum likelihood tree based on the nucleotide sequences of partial RdRp gene of bat CoVs is the bat species that make up the clade. similarity between our Florida BtCoV sequence and those of the Brazilian BtCoVs could be an indicator of how bat BtCoVs in Florida will evolve. the divergence of the Florida BtCoV could indicate the beginning of a new clade based on geographical location and not bat species."}
