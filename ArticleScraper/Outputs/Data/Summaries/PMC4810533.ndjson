{"summary": "a large family of neuraminic acid derivatives decorate all eukaryotic cell surfaces, usually at the termini of glycans attached as glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, and the proteoglycan keratin sulfate. most SAs as virus receptors are terminal SAs attached to the underlying sugar chain by an 2,3 linkage. this may contribute to virus tissue tropism, pathogenesis, and host specificity. avian, and porcine picornaviruses have been assigned as members of a new picornavirus genus, Sapelovirus (14, 15) pigs are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to PSV, although pregnant guinea pigs experimentally infected with PSV developed placental lesions (17, 19) a large number of viruses, including several picornaviruses, use SAs as receptors. the aim of this study was to determine whether PSV could recognize SAs as receptors. the isolated viruses were confirmed as PSVs. human rotavirus (RV) strain Wa (ATCC) was propagated in MA-104 cells. Enterovirus 70 (EV70) strain J670/71 (ATCC) was propagated in WI-38 cells. anti-PSV capsid monoclonal antibody (MAb) was used in this study. anti-FCV capsid MAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CVB3 capsid MAb (Millipore), anti-EV70 capsid MAb (Abcam), anti-RV VP6 protein MAb (Median Diagnostics), anti-RV VP8* polyclonal antibody were purchased from Matreya. cells in 96-well plates were incubated with medium containing different concentrations of various chemicals for 24 h. after removing the medium, 200 l of MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. 150 l of DMSO was read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader with the optical density measured at 570 nm. confluent monolayers of cells were infected with each individual virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were starved for 2 h and supplemented with 1 Mbq of [35S]methionine-cysteine (PerkinElmer) ml1. purified viruses were dialyzed into 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) for fluorescence labeling or in TNE buffer for a radioactivity assay overnight and then stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. Plaque assays showed no loss in infectivity with each labeled virus in each permissible cell line in comparison with unlabeled virus. labeled virus was repurified with CsCl, dialyzed against virion buffer, and stored in 2-g aliquots at 20\u00b0C (30) analysis of SDS-PAGE-separated, AF-594-labeled viral particles by Coomassie blue staining and Western blotting showed that the label was exclusively coupled to the viral capsid protein. purified [35S]methionine-cysteine-labeled viruses (50,000 cpm) were incubated with cells for 45 min on ice. cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, followed by cell lysis with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. anti-PSV capsid (1:40 dilution), anti-FCV capsid (1:100 dilution), anti-EV70 capsid (1:100 dilution), and anti-RV VP6 protein (1:50 dilution) MAbs were added. cells were then washed three times with PBS-NCS. medium containing 50 M PDMP or 25 mU of PLC was replaced every 24 h prior to infection. cloning, expression, and purification of VP8* of rotavirus and P domain of human norovirus. MA-104 cells (ATCC) were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin. the isolated viruses were confirmed as PSVs by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), reverse transcription-PCR, and transmission electron microscopy. dl-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C were dissolved in ethanol. other reagents included [35S]methionine-cysteine (PerkinElmer), neuraminidase (NA; Sigma-Aldrich), and sialidase S (SS; Prozyme). LS-tetrasaccharide c (LSTc) was obtained from Matreya. biotin-conjugated oligosaccharides, including Lewis antigens (Lea, Leb, Lex, and Ley), were purchased from GlycoTech. Neuraminidases (NA or SS) were pretreated at 200 mU or 40 mU for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Proteases (trypsin or chymotrypsin) were employed at 10 g ml1 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. infected cell cultures harvested at 72 h postinoculation were freeze-thawed three times. cell debris was spun down at 2,469 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. a total of 500 ml of virus-containing supernatants was concentrated by centrifugation at 245,853 g for 20 h at 4\u00b0C using an SW40 rotor (Beckman) labeling of viruses with AF-594 was performed by following manufacturer's instructions. each purified virus (10 mg at 1 mg ml1) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) was labeled with a 0.1-fold molar concentration of AF-594 succinimidyl ester (1 mg at 1 mg ml1 in DMSO) labeled virus was repurified with CsCl as described above, dialyzed against virion buffer unlabeled viruses were inoculated with AF-594-labeled virus at an MOI of 1,000 and incubated for 5 min on ice. cells were washed extensively with cold PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and washed three times with cold PBS. assay for binding of [35S]methionine-cysteine-labeled viruses to various cell lines. confluent monolayers of cells on the confocal dish were treated with various inhibitors or enzymes. cells were infected with each virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed three times with PBS, and then the maintenance medium was added. 96-microtiter plates were coated with viruses or viral proteins. each synthetic oligosaccharide-polyacrylamide-biotin conjugate or blocking solution was added to each well. 387 human norovirus strains were cloned, expressed, and purified. the concentrations of purified RV VP8* and NV P domains were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. RESULTS Carbohydrate moieties are required for attachment and infection of PSV. the binding of AF-594-labeled PSV (MOI, 1,000 PFU/cell) was examined by confocal microscopy after pretreating LLC-PK cells with NaIO4. the levels of bound virus were expressed as a percentage of the value for the virus-infected control. the scale bars corresponded to 20 m. HBGAs are not used for PSV attachment. HBGAs are not used for PSV attachment. s in the no-HBGA control and no-antigen control wells as a background are 0.04 and 0.06 respectively. SAs act as receptors for many viruses (1). binding of these viruses is blocked by monosaccharide NANA but not by monosaccharide Gal or oligosaccharide 6\u2032-SL (4, 25) soluble form of NANA on binding of AF-594-labeled PSV to LLC-PK cells was examined by confocal microscopy. the effect of soluble NANA on the binding of AF-594-labeled PSV, EV70, FCV, or CVB3 to each corresponding cell was measured by liquid scintillation. pretreatment of cells with NA significantly reduced binding of AF-594-labeled or radiolabeled PSV and SA-dependent FCV as well as EV70, but not CVB3. SS treatment significantly reduced the binding of EV70, which uses 2,3-linked SA as a receptor, but had no effect on binding or infection of 2,6-linked SA-dependent FCV or DAF-dependent CVB3. the levels of PSV, EV70, FCV, or CVB3 antigen-positive cells expressed as percentages of mock-treated, virus-infected cells were quantified from three independent fields of view. all experiments were performed three independent times. the scale bars correspond to 20 m. the effect of MAL or SNL pretreatment of permissive cells on the infectivity of PSV was assessed by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody specific for PSV capsid protein at 15 h postinfection. the levels of PSV, EV70, FCV, or CVB3 antigen-positive cells expressed as percentages of the mock-treated, virus-infected cells were quantified from three independent fields of view. cal microscopy after pretreating LLC-PK cells with lipid metabolic inhibitors (PMDP and PLC) or proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) was measured by liquid scintillation. the effect of lipid metabolic inhibitor or protease pretreatment of each permissive cell on the infectivity of PSV. gangliosides were depleted by PMDP pretreatment and reconstituted by the addition of various free gangliosides. of these gangliosides, GM1, GD1a, and GT1b possess one terminal 2,3-linked SA. the other gangliosides have no terminal 2,3-linked SA, with or without internal 2,3- or 2,8-linked SA. PDMP treatment reduced binding and infection of PSV to 24% and 1% the levels of bound virus were expressed as a percentage of the value for the mock-treated, virus-inoculated control. the effects of PDMP for ganglioside depletion followed by the addition of various free gangliosides. to confirm the specificity of NaIO4 treatment, we used FCV and EV70, both of which could utilize terminal SA as a receptor. as a negative control, we used CVB3, which uses decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a receptor (33). as expected, pretreatment of cells with NaIO4 reduced the binding of carbohydrate-dependent FCV and EV70 in a dose-dependent manner. the levels of bound virus were expressed as a percentage of the value for the mock-treated, virus-infected control. the effect of NaIO4 pretreatment of permissive cells on the infectivity of PSV was assessed by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody specific for PSV capsid protein at 15 h postinfection. the binding ability of PSV strains (KS05151, KS05152, KS04105, or KS055217), the P domain of the human NV VA207 (GII.9) and VA387 (GII.4) strains, VP8* of RV strain Dhaka6, and influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were determined using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. the samples with absorbance greater than 0.62 of the cutoff value were the binding of SA-dependent FCV and EV70 was significantly blocked by NANA, whereas the binding of DAF receptor-dependent CVB3 was unaffected. soluble NANA also significantly decreased the infection of PSV, FCV, and EV70 but not CVB3. cells were pretreated with NA to cleave all 2,3-linked, 2,6-linked, and 2,8-linked SAs from underlying glycans or with SS to cleave 2,3-linked SA only (25) pretreatment of cells with NA significantly reduced the binding of AF-594-labeled or radiolabeled PSV and SA-dependent FCV as well as EV70. the effect of pretreament of NA or SS to each corresponding cell on the binding of [35S]methionine-cysteine-labeled PSV, EV70, FCV, or CVB3 (50,000 cpm) was examined by liquid scintillation counting and expressed as percentage of the value for the mock-treated, virus-infected control. binding of AF-594-labeled PSV (MOI, 1,000 PFU/cell) was examined by confocal microscopy. effect of pretreament of MAL or SNL to each corresponding cell on binding of 50,000 cpm. RV strain Wa uses glycosphinogolipid-containing SA moieties as receptors. EV70 and FCV recognize glycoproteins containing SA moieties as receptors. pretreatment of cells with PDMP or PLC markedly reduced PSV binding. cells were pretreated with trypsin or chymotrypsin proteases to examine their effect on PSV or RV binding and infection. however, the binding and infection of FCV were markedly reduced by both proteases. the decrease of binding and infection was rescued by the addition of GD1a (Fig. 7B and D) but not by other gangliosides. these data suggest that PSV binds to both the terminal and internal 2,3-linked SA moieties on GD1a and that the 2,8-linked SA moiety on TG1b could interfere with binding of PSV. cells expressed as a percentage of the values for the mock-treated, virus-inoculated control were quantified from three independent fields of view. asterisks indicate SD from triplicate experiments. ocarditis virus, a member within the genus Cardiovirus, recognizes 2,6-linked SAs. EV71 can utilize both 2,3- and 2,6-linked SAs in addition to several protein receptors (40). some echoviruses can use CD55 and heparan sulfate (41). chymotrypsin or trypsin treatment of cells had no effect on virus infection. these findings may imply that different PSV strains may use HBGAs but not terminal SA as a receptor."}
