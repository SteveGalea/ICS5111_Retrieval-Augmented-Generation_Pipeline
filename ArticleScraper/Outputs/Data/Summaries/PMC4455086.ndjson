{"summary": "over 40% of the alleged artemisinin-containing drugs were falsified, outright fakes. a wide variety of falsified brand name and generic medicines have been found in rich and poor countries. falsifiers have created products visually indistinguishable from the genuine product, clearly demonstrating criminal intent to deceive. despite increasing awareness of the fraudulent drug epidemic, efforts to quantify and stop this peril have been stymied by multiple obstacles. there are increasing reports of detection of a variety of fake drugs from around the world. there are virtually no reports from middle- or high-income countries quantifying the state of poor quality medicines. the variability or absence of national and international criminal statutes, lack of an international agreement against trafficking of poor quality medicines reflect the weak legal framework for confronting drug fraud. global leadership to date has devolved in parts to the WHO, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, and INTERPOL, each with diverse missions, responsibilities, limited authorities, and their own collaborations, funding networks, cultures, and languages. no organization is leading assertively. a very promising recent development has been the U.S. Pharmacopeia Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM) program in several African, Asian, and Latin American countries using the \u201cMinilab\u201d (Global Pharma Health Fund e.V., Giessen, Germany) a major reference training center has recently been opened in Accra, Ghana, with USAID and U.S. Pharmacopeia support as a referral testing and regional training center. Detects Visual inspection of package and product Wrong package, color, size, shape, and spelling Alternative light sources Wrong color of ink, holograms, packaging, excipients in pills (wavelengths in the visible (350\u2013700 nm) and nonvisible (> 700 nm) electromagnetic spectrum Colorimetry Wrong kind and/or amounts of API Simplified disintegration tests Disintegration, as marker for bioavailability \u201cMinilab\u201d Compendium of no independent agency has inventoried and performed comparative quality assessments of these packaging and drug-testing devices. objective comparisons are needed of the diversity of field methods in terms of accuracy, reliability, costs of equipment and supplies, level of training needed, ease of use, and maintenance requirements. low-cost, portable detection tools would empower pharmaceutical inspectors in numerous countries that have oversight of the medicine supply. a convention would define the various sorts of wrongful medicines accurately and thereby avoid misunderstandings caused by today's problematic or vague terminology. a convention would promote the requirement that signatory countries enact national laws to designate wrongful acts. a convention would provide the legal and institutional framework for participating countries to agree, implement, and evolve convergent standards of medicine regulation. in 2006, 54% and 21% of illegal drugs of all sorts confiscated worldwide were manufactured in india and china. the internet has opened up an unregulated opportunity for criminals to promote and sell fake drugs to unsuspecting vulnerable populations. the biggest obstacle to solving the problem of poor quality medicines has been the lack of a clear lead organization. WHO estimates 30% of countries have inadequate medicines regulation authorities. 90% of African MRAs lack the capacity to undertake medicine regulatory functions. some argue that the U.N. system is poorly suited to be in a leadership role. the FDA may be the most qualified as a leadership organization based on their technical expertise and global influence. mechanisms for training technical staff, regulating products, improving manufacturing practices, and stopping criminal production are needed to assure a good supply of medicines. a major obstacle to understanding the types, names, extent, and amount of poor quality drugs nationally and globally has been the lack of agreed-upon field survey approaches18 and 2) available low-cost tools to detect and classify bad drugs quickly at points of entry into countries, at public and private pharmacies. counterfeit detection (CD)-3 is a promising handheld electronic device for peripheral use. it detects fake packaging at point of sale with images and videos of the suspect samples. FDA, Skoll Foundation, and other partners are supporting expansion of testing and use of this device. no independent agency has inventoried and performed comparative quality assessments of these packaging and drug-testing devices. objective comparisons are needed of the diversity of field methods in terms of accuracy, reliability, costs of equipment and supplies, level of training needed, ease of use. a multi-sectorial effort is essential for taking into account how this illegal market is interwoven with world trade agreements, business models, and associated legal ramifications. an international law convention against substandard and falsified medicines would address both regulatory and criminal international governance challenges simultaneously through technical, legal, and financial mechanisms. some have said that establishing recommended codes of practice that are nonbinding are better than international norms and regulations that are binding (hard law) there are precedents for using international law in this way. a 1929 treaty that internationally criminalizes counterfeit banknotes provides an analogy for falsified medicines. the internet has opened up an unregulated opportunity for criminals to promote and sell fake drugs to unsuspecting vulnerable populations. a recent survey of over 10,000 online pharmacies found that 96% operated outside legal regulations and a large percentage closed operations within 3 years of operation. more than 18,000 illegal websites were closed during one week in 2012 with seizure of US$10.5 million of pharmaceuticals worldwide. rapid alert notices are published periodically by WHO indicating the fake drug type, lot number, quantity of product, and place detected. strong action by countries can stem the tide as shown in Rwanda39 and Cambodia40. one solution is creation of regional harmonization networks, addressing some elements of drug registration tied to regional economic communities. the drug quality and security act outlines steps to build an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs in the united states. the results of this system are awaited. the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should include measurable objectives for good quality drugs. participate in global disease control and elimination programs."}
