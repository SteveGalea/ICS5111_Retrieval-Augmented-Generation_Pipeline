{"summary": "we reviewed chest imaging manifestations of severe adenovirus pneumonia in eight immunocompetent adults from April 2012 to April 2014. results All patients showed abnormal results on initial chest radiograph and CT, with exception of one normal initial chest radiograph. the abnormalities of the initial chest radiographs were unilateral (n=4) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=4), dense patchy opacity (n=3), ground glass opacity (GGO (n=3), and ple sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe community-acquired pneumonia in healthy adults (2,3). bilateral interstitial infiltrates were previously reported as the principal imaging findings in adults with adenovirus pneumonia. but cytolysis, hemorrhagic necrosis, and grossly congested, consolidated lungs are the typical pathological changes seen in adenovirus pneumonia. coronavirus, or respiratory syncytial virus were negative at admission in all eight patients. three cases infected Acinetobacter baumannii during mechanical ventilation in the later phase of hospitalization. there were eight patients (male-female ratio, 3:1) with an age range from 22 to 52 years (mean age, 35.9 years) none of the patients were severely immunocompromised. the major symptoms at presentation were high fever(>39 \u00b0C) (n=8), dyspnea (n=8), cough (n=8), septic shock (n=4), hemoptysis (n=4), chest pain (n=3), diarrhea (n=2) images were photographed on both lung (window width 1,200\u20131,600 HU; level 500\u2013700 HU) and mediastinal (window width 350\u2013450 HU; level 20\u201340 HU) settings. each lung was divided into upper and lower zones on radiographs. criteria for chest radiographic and CT findings findings were preferentially defined according to the \u201cFleischner Society\u2019s Glossary of Terms\u201d (12). bacterial, fungal or viral cultures for rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, or respiratory syncytial virus were negative at admission in all eight patients. there were eight patients (male-female ratio, 3:1) with an age range from 22 to 52 years (mean age, 35.9 years) none of the patients were severely immunocompromised. imaging techniques Chest radiographs were performed using computed radiography or portable computed radiography at bedside. some of the initial CT scans were performed in different institutions. the technical parameters included 0.625, 0.75 or 1 mm collimation at 2\u20137 mm section thicknesses. images were photographed on both lung and mediastinal settings. no reticular opacities were found on chest radiography. the areas of parenchymal abnormalities involved mainly the lower lung zones in four patients, the upper lung zones in one patient, and random in two patients. the initial CT scans of all eight patients showed abnormalities. initial CT scans were performed at 2\u201313 days [mean, 6.03.4 (SD) days] after illness onset. abnormal findings were unilateral (n=5) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=8), GGO (n=2) and small nodules (n=1) on initial CT scans, focal consolidation (Figures 3A) were the main findings in six patients whose initial CT scans were examined within one week after illness onset. first follow-up CT scans performed within ten days of illness onset showed rapid progression of the abnormalities. included, more extensive unilateral (1 of 6) or bilateral (5 of 6) areas of consolidation, and unilateral (2 of 6) or bilateral (4 of 6) pleural effusion. reticular opacities involved mainly the lower lung zones in four patients, the upper lung zones in one patient, and random in two patients. first follow-up chest radiographs in five of seven patients showed a remarkable increase in both opacity and size of abnormalities. most follow-up chest radiographs showed a rapid progression of lesions within ten days of illness onset. initial CT scans were performed at 2\u201313 days [mean, 6.03.4 (SD) days] after illness onset. predominant bilateral consolidation with adjacent GGO were seen in one patient\u2019s initial CT which was examined nine days after illness onset. baseline CT scan in a 33-year-old man with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus pneumonia shows bilateral ground-glass opacity. all eight patients were significantly more at the time of maximum severity (2 to 5, mean 4 lobes) than at the presentation (1 to 4, mean 1.7 lobes). the serial CT findings showed no appearance of fibrosis such as reticular opacities, cystic lesions, or traction bronchiectasis. more than 60% of adenovirus pneumonia patients need intubation and mechanical ventilation. adenovirus pneumonia is associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. adenovirus pneumonia is associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. however, bilateral infiltrates or consolidation were also reported in adenovirus pneumonia. adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults manifests usually as focal consolidation followed by a rapid progression to bilateral consolidation. adenovirus CAP in immunocompetent adults manifests usually as focal consolidation followed by a rapid progression to bilateral consolidation, usually accompanied by adjacent GGO and pleural effusion."}
