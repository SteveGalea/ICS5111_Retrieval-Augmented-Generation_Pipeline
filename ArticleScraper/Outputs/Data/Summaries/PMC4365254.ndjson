{"summary": "a total of 843 people in 21 different countries have been infected by the virus. the current MERS-CoV outbreak investigations suggest that camels are a source of human infections. however, the exact route of transmission from camels to humans remains unclear. based on the detection of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein by highly selective monoclonal antibodies. in the first phase, the ICA was developed at the bioNote laboratory in south Korea. bridomas were produced by fusing spleen cells with the mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 by polyethylene glycol (15) the hybridomas were then selected in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine\u2013armitage medium (Gibco)\u201310% fetal calf serum (FCS) the antibody screening cells were further cloned using the limiting dilution method. PCR products were then cloned into the NHeI/HindIII restriction site of the pET-28a-TEV vector. a single colony was grown in 2 YT medium (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin for 16 h. the protein was then purified using a 5-ml HisTrap column attached to an Akta prime chromatography a solution of 1 ml of 1% chloroauric acid was diluted to a final concentration of 0.01% with 100 ml of deionized double-distilled water. a volume of 2 ml of 1% sodium citrate solution was then added, the mixture was heated until the solution showed a wine red color. five minutes later, 1 ml of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added. the camel nasal swabs were transferred from the field to the laboratory in a universal transport medium (TM) within 24 h after collection and stored at 80\u00b0C until testing. a total of 100 l of the transport medium was transferred into a test tube containing 100 l of added assay diluents. the recombinant NC protein was diluted into 2-fold steps from 1,600 ng/ml to 0.78 ng/ml. all dilutions were then tested simultaneously by real-time PCR and the ICA kit. the sensitivity of the ICA was evaluated using RNA from cultured MERS-CoV. the upE real-time reverse transcription-PCR was carried out as previously reported. 571 camel nasal swabs were tested concomitantly by the ICA and the upE and Orf1A real-time RT-PCR. reproducibility of the ICA was measured by analyzing 20 replicates. the conjugated peptides were used as injectable immunogens for BALB/c mice. three booster injections consisting of 200 l of the same synthetic peptide antigen emulsified with Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) were given intraperitoneally every 2 weeks. three days later, each immunized mouse was euthanized. oligonucleotide primers MERS-CoV F (5\u2032-GCTAGCCGATCGGTTTTGCCGATAAC-3\u2032) were used as a template in the PCRs. the PCR products were then cloned into the NHeI/HindIII restriction site of the pET-28a-TEV vector. the monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P1 antibody was coated on a specific area on the nitrocellulose membrane (test line [T]. goat anti-mouse IgG was coated on another specific area on the same membrane (control line [C]) the membrane was then dried and kept tightly sealed at room temperature. the assay strips were prepared by laminating the nitrocellulose membrane, a colloidal gold-conjugated glass fiber, and an absorbent paper by a polyvinyl chloride self-adhesive floor. the strips were cut by a slitter and kept tightly sealed (Fig. 1). the strips were cut by a slitter and kept tightly sealed. personal protective equipment, including disposable gowns, gloves, and head covers were used during sample collection, shipment, and testing. the assay was first used to screen coronaviruses of other animals, including canine coronavirus (CCV), canine coronavirus (FCV) and feline coronavirus (FCV) from the ATCC. RNA from the cultured virus was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) 5 l of RNA was used in a one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR UpE assay using the Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P1, monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P2, monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P3, monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P4, and monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P5 were selected as a capture and a detector for the immunochromatographic assay. a 10% SDS-PAGE gel viewed after Coomassie blue staining for 5 synthetic peptides for the synthetic peptide MERS-NP P3 was detected using monoclonal anti-MERS P1 (#46) and optimized concentration of the antibody (1:5,000 [vol/vol]. the recombinant MERS-CoV nucleoprotein (NP) (44.5 kDa) was successfully expressed and detected with the monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P3 antibody. sensitivity of the ICA was determined using a dilution range of 107 to 101 TCID50 of cultured MERS-CoV. the ICA showed a sensitivity of up to 104 TCID50, while the ICA showed a sensitivity of up to 105 TCID50. the repeatability of the ICA was found to be >95% when 20 negative and positive replicates of camel nasal swabs sample were tested. the relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA compared to those of the real-time RT-PCR resulta were 93.90% and 99.6%, respectively. the ICA performance was stable at 25\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. al anti-MERS-CoV P1 specific for aa 22 to 40 and the monoclonal anti-MERS-CoV P3 specific for aa 164 to 202 were selected as a capture and a detector for the immunochromatographic assay. they were reactive with Western blotting and produced the best sensitivity and specificity results. ICA specificity was determined using coronaviruses of other animals, including BVC, CCV, and FCV. all 18 negative-control samples were also negative by the ICA. the detection limit of the assay was found to be 1.5 ng/ml. time PCR showed a sensitivity of up to 104 TCID50, while the ICA showed a sensitivity of up to 105 TCID50 (Table 2). TABLE 2. Sensitivity of the ICA compared to that of the UpE real-time reverse transcription-PCR TCID50 CT valuea. ICA Performance parameter Value 95% CIa Sensitivity (%) 93.90 85.19\u201398.29 Specificity (%) 99.60 98.57\u201399.94 Positive likelihood ratio 237.20 59.40\u2013947.12 Negative likelihood ratio 0.06 0.02\u20130.16 Disease prevalence (%) 11.56 9.05\u201314.47 Positive predictive value (%) 99.21 97.99\u201399.78 a 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. the ICA is based on the detection of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein by highly selective monoclonal antibodies. antigens in the samples first bind to specific gold-labeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) on a fiberglass membrane to form an antigen-antibody complex labeled with gold. the complex moves through a nitrocellulose membrane, where it binds with monoclonal antibody at a test line. the ICA developed here is considered satisfactory to be used for herd screening against MERS-CoV antigen across international borders, animal markets, and slaughterhouses. it is highly recommended that personal protective equipment (PPE) be used when running the test in the field."}
