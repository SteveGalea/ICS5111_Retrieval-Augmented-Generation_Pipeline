{"summary": "previously well 69-year-old was admitted to a regional hospital the following day. he returned to australia on day 12 of travel and was admitted to a regional hospital the following day. he did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis, nor did he have a prior history of japan encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination. on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, meropenem, benzyl penicillin, and acyclovir. neurological examination upon arrival revealed a generalized flaccid paralysis. a magnetic resonance image of the brain showed no abnormalities. diagnostic assays performed on the initial and a repeat CSF were negative. the presence of measles IgG in plasma but not CSF was consistent with local production of JEV antibodies in CSF rather than contamination. the presence of measles IgG in plasma was weakly positive on day 7 but negative on days 12 and 13 and thought to represent nonspecific cross-reactivity. DISCUSSION Japanese encephalitis virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic in most parts of Asia. it is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. in a 2011 systematic review, it was estimated that 67 900 cases occur annually. japanese encephalitis is a rare infection in travelers, with only 79 cases among travelers or expatriates from nonendemic countries reported to the centers from disease control and prevention from 1973 to 2015 [13] japanese encephalitis is a rare infection in travelers, with only 79 cases among travelers or expatriates. in a 2009 review on EV in travelers, more than half of 21 cases were acquired after short-term travel. a short-term traveler who visits endemic areas should be informed about the risk of disease, potential outcomes, and the risks and benefits of JEV vaccination."}
