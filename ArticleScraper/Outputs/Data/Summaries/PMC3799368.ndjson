{"summary": "six rhesus macaques were inoculated with 7 106 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of HCoV-EMC/2012. clinical signs upon inoculation were transient and varied between animals. analysis of blood samples collected 0, 1, 3, and 6 d postinfection indicated increased white blood cell counts in five of six animals on 1 dpi. only one animal had a positive nasal swab on day 6 postinfection. all urogenital and rectal swabs were negative with the exception of a urogenital swab collected from CoV-2 on day 1 postinfection. we have previously reported the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus throughout the lungs of inoculated macaques. viral load decreased between 3 and 6 dpi (13) rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV. transmission electron microscopy performed on lung lesion samples collected 6 dpi. coronavirus particles could be detected in alveolar pneumocytes. qRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the right lower lung lobe and lung lesions obtained 3 and 6 dpi. alveoli contained moderate numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils. many of these alveolar macrophages formed multinucleate syncytia. one animal euthanized 3 dpi also displayed lesions similar to those described as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. d interstitial pneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans (arrow). Airways are filled with organizing fibrin, necrotic debris, collagen and fibroblasts. alveolar space contains inflammatory cells and a multinucleate syncytial cell (arrowhead). anticoronaviral IHC reveals viral antigen in alveolar pneumocytes. at 3 dpi, in situ hybridization (ISH) demonstrated viral RNA multifocally in the lungs of all monkeys. the signal was found in spindle to polygonal cells along alveolar septae. welch\u2019s t test (P 0.01, fold-change 2) was used to compare profiles of significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) from the right lower lung lobe to observable gross lesions. qPCR demonstrated that viral genomes were present in those samples, allowing us to compare sites of histopathologic injury to the background transcriptional profiles. the heatmap shows log10 ratios to uninfected controls of differentially expressed genes in the right lung lower lobe and lung lesion samples. a representation is shown of 173 differentially expressed genes from individual animals and sample sites at 3 dpi (A) and 37 differentially expressed genes from individual animals and sample sites at 6 dpi (B) plasma levels of 23 cytokines and chemokines were determined in serum samples obtained at 0, 1, 3, and 6 dpi. transient differences were only observed for IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IFN-, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. total number of white blood cells (Left), neutrophils (Center) and lymphocytes (Right) were determined in blood samples obtained from animals 0, 1, 3, and 6 dpi. no samples are available for 6 dpi. each line represents one animal: CoV-1 (), CoV-2 (), CoV-3 (), CoV-4 (), CoV-5 (), CoV-6 (). RNA was extracted and viral load was determined as TCID50 equivalents by qRT-PCR. black bars indicate viral load at 1 dpi, white bars indicate viral load at 3 dpi, and gray bars indicate viral load at 6 dpi. rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV. rhesus macaques were euthanized on day 3 (black bars) and day 6 (white bars) postinfection and tissue samples were collected. RNA was extracted and viral load was determined as TCID50 equivalents by qRT-PCR. lesions were characterized as multifocal, mild (Fig. 5A) to marked (Fig. 5B) interstitial pneumonia. one animal euthanized 3 dpi also displayed lesions similar to those described as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. inflammatory cells were observed multifocally within and adjacent to affected areas of the lung. animals necropsied at 6 dpi demonstrated moderate changes in the lungs. rhesus macaques were euthanized on day 3 postinfection. rhesus macaques were euthanized at 6 dpi and lung tissue was stained with H&E. Mild acute interstitial pneumonia demonstrated by mild thickening of alveolar septae by small numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, fibrin, and edema. stellate cells within the cortex of the mediastinal lymph nodes that were positive for both viral RNA by ISH and viral antigen by IHC. these cells were morphologically consistent with cells of the macrophage or dendritic cell lineage. viral antigen was predominantly found in alveolar pneumocytes on 3 as well as 6 dpi. genes such as IL-6, chemokine C-X-C ligand 1 (CXCL1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) were significantly up-regulated in the lesions compared with the right lower lung lobes. by day 6, we identified only 37 DEG distinguishing right lower lung lobes from lesions. this finding may reflect the resolving clinical status of the animals at day 6 postinfection. a significant response to MERS-CoV infection is observed only on day 1 postinfection. in lungs a significant global response was found only 3 dpi. by 6 dpi, the gene expression dynamics in both organs return close to an uninfected or baseline state. the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 was the second introduction in 10 y of a novel coronavirus, causing severe respiratory disease, into the human population. both the severity of the respiratory disease and the genetic similarity to betacoronaviruses isolated from bats are reminiscent of the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003. the exact distribution of DPP4 is in accordance with our observation of MERS-CoV virus replication in the alveoli. the distribution of DPP4 is in accord with our observation of MERS-CoV virus replication in the alveoli and suggests a role for DPP4 in tissue tropism of the novel coronavirus. the transient nature of disease observed in rhesus macaques suggests that this model does not recapitulate the disease observed in the fatal cases of MERS-CoV. the disease displayed in the rhesus macaques is reminiscent of SARS-CoV in nonhuman primates. sus macaques and the associated cytokine and chemokine levels in serum samples may have resulted in chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. transient patterns were observed for virus shedding, viral loads in tissues, neutrophilia, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, regulation of host gene expression, and production of cytokines. rhesus macaques were inoculated with 7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012. RNA was extracted from swabs, BAL, and whole blood samples using the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. raw array data were uploaded to Genedata Analyst 7.6 (Genedata) raw array data have been deposited in GEO database. concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in serum were measured using the non-Human Primate Cytokine MILLIPLEX map 23-plex kit (Millipore) six rhesus macaques (four males, two females; age 6\u201310 y, weight 5\u201310 kg) were inoculated with 7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012. for detailed information, see SI Materials and Methods. transmission electron microscopy was performed essentially as described previously. concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in serum were measured using the non-Human Primate Cytokine MILLIPLEX map 23-plex kit (Millipore)"}
