{"summary": "innate immune response is referred to as a double-edged sword as it is essential for inducing immune responses against pathogens. innate immune response is referred to as a double-edged sword as it is essential for inducing immune responses against pathogens. a fatality occurred during a clinical trial. ATP is often applied to induce secretion of IL-1 from macrophages. ATP has been considered an endogenous danger signal since cells maintain a high concentration of ATP but it is mostly absent outside of the cell. ATP is exogenously added at milli-molar concentrations to stimulate P2X7R. other studies used strong cytotoxic treatments to show release of ATP form dying cell can induce inflammatory responses. mice with a deficiency in the innate immune system often do worse than wild-type mice when infected with wild-type viruses. however, the same deficient mice would be spared from the host-damaging effect that could be activated by the relevant innate immune mechanism. studies clearly demonstrated that macrophages is a major player in Ad induced inflammatory responses. thelial cell line, MLE-15 (MLE), and a mouse macrophage cell line, Raw 264.7 (Raw) resulted in induction of inflammatory mediators including pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). inflammatory mediators were absent or much lower when Raw cell mono-culture was infected with Ad. aw co-culture was infected with Ad for 24 h in the presence of oATP. the amount of NO produced in the culture was measured from the medium using Griess reagent. data are expressed as mean SD. MLE-Raw co-cultures were infected with the designated MOI of Ad. the amount of NO produced in the culture medium was measured by Griess assay. data are expressed as mean SD. we detected no IL-1 in the media of the Ad infected MLE-Raw co-culture. there was induction of IL-1 gene expression and pro-IL-1 was detected from the cell extract. IL-1 secretion was more evident when infected with more than 20 MOI. the amount of IL-1 was maximized when the co-culture was consists of 5050 ratio of two cell types. infection of J774 cells alone did not induce IL-1 secretion. the co-cultures consisted of mouse macrophage cells and human airway epithelial cells also induce IL-1 secretion. IL-1 was measured 24 h after infection. data are expressed as mean SD. inhibition of P2X7R and caspase-1 reduced IL-1 secretion. the co-culture of MLE and a P2X7R deficient J774 cell line (ATPR) was establish and IL-1 in the medium was measured 24 h after Ad infection. data are expressed as mean SD. the NLRP3-KO macrophage co-culture was established with MLE and peritoneal macrophages obtained from wild-type mice. IL-1 was measured from the medium 24 h (18 h and 24 h for NLRP3-KO) after Ad infection. data are expressed as mean SD. the wild-type mice were infected with Ad at two dosages, 51010 or 11011 vp/mouse. the mice that received 11011 vp (n = 5) showed no apparent symptoms and sustained only slight weight loss but recovered within a few days. the mice that received 11011 vp (n = 5) showed no apparent symptoms. the wild-type (n = 12) and the P2X7R-KO mice (n = 13) were infected with Ad. the individual body weight on day 3 was presented as the relative retained body weight. the wild-type (n = 6) and the caspase-1-KO mice (n = 6) were compared. Enhanced survival in P2X7R-KO mice is due to reduced inflammatory responses. despite the apparent differences in the overall response to Ad infection the histopathologic features of the lungs were similar to those of the wild-type mice. however, there is no difference between wild-type and P2X7R-KO mice in the viral titers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 24 h after infection. ATP signaling through P2X7R regulates induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine and neutrophil infiltration. the wild-type (C57/B6) and the P2X7R-KO mice were infected with Ad (11011 vp/mice) by i.n. administration. cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were absent or much lower when Raw cell mono-culture was infected with Ad. oATP treatment significantly decreased induction of key inflammatory cytokines. the MLE-Raw co-culture was infected with Ad and ROS positive cells from were counted by flow cytometry after treating with 3-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) without gating for specific cell types. shown is a representative FACS histogram of three independent experiments with the percentage of ROS positive population. the co-culture of MLE and a P2X7R deficient Raw cell was established as MLE-Raw co-culture. the amount of NO produced in the culture medium was measured by Griess assay. we detected no IL-1 in the media of the Ad infected MLE-Raw co-culture. there was induction of IL-1 gene expression and pro-IL-1 was detected from the cell extract. we used another mouse cell line, J774.A1 (J774) in the co-culture system. the fact that infection of J774 cells alone did not induce IL-1 secretion indicates that inflammasome activation requires additional signals generated from the interaction between neighboring macrophages and epithelial cells. the co-cultures consisted of mouse macrophage cells and human airway epithelial cells (A549) also induce IL-1 secretion. 200\u2013400 M of oATP significantly reduced IL-1 secretion. IL-1 secretion was also inhibited by z-YVAD-fmk. IL-1 secretion was also inhibited by z-YVAD-fmk. data are expressed as mean SD. co-cultures consisted of primary macrophages with deficiency in P2X7R and caspase-1 secreted less IL-1 after Ad infection. IL-1 secretion in the co-culture with peritoneal macrophage was significantly reduced. the co-culture was established with MLE and peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice. IL-1 was measured from the medium 24 h after infection. data are expressed as mean SD. the wild-type (C57/B6) mice were infected with Ad at two dosages, 51010 or 11011 vp/mouse. the mice that received 51010 vp (n = 5) showed no apparent symptoms and sustained only slight weight loss but recovered within a few days. the mice that received 11011 vp (n = 5) showed no apparent symptoms. X7R-KO mice (n = 13) were intranasally infected with Ad. the individual body weight on day 3 was presented as the relative retained body weight. the wild-type (n = 6) and caspase-1-KO mice (n = 6) were compared. the histopathologic features of the lungs in the P2X7R-KO mice were similar to those of the wild-type mice. we also found that there is no difference between wild-type and P2X7R-KO mice in the viral titers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 24 h after infection. it is well known from studies on acute viral infection as well as sepsis that overwhelming cytokine production and excessive neutrophil infiltration are the wild-type (C57/B6) and the P2X7R-KO mice were infected with Ad (11011 vp/mice) by i.n. administration. the mice were sacrificed on day 4 (n = 4) and the lungs were obtained. studies have examined the role of viral PAMPs and their relevant PRRs in inflammation. this is partly due to the paucity of models that can be used to study the effect of danger signals. replication deficient viral vector provides a unique model allowing us to generate the condition of acute viral infection without ongoing viral proliferation. a high dose of replication deficient Ad is administered by intranasal route. the infection resulted in ARDS-like symptoms and fatality. over production of cytokines has been proposed as a factor contributing to the severity of the disease in viral infection. luciferase-based detection method was used in mice to demonstrate extracellular ATP can accumulate at the site of inflammation to a concentration high enough to activate P2X7R. ATP released from cells dying from Ad infection would trigger the ATP-P2X7R mediated inflammatory responses. ATP can only occur when ATP is secreted by dying cells close to macrophages. IL-1 secretion was maximized when macrophages and epithelial cells were in 5050 mixtures. this condition should provide an ideal condition where ATP released from an Ad infected co-culture can be readily sensed by the macrophages in the vicinity. ATP-P2X7R signaling may regulate cellular responses in addition to inflammasome activation. the mechanism downstream of ATP-P2X7R leading to the inflammasome activation is not clearly understood. there is a controversy about whether inflammasome activation is mediated by ATP or ROS. IL-1 binds to the same receptor and induces the same inflammatory responses as IL-1. it does not require post-translational modification through inflammasome pathway. a high concentration of ATP released from virus infected cells functions as a danger signal, which activates the inflammatory responses including inflammasome pathway. the helper-dependent Ad was used in the in vitro experiments. the cell lines and the primary macrophage cells were cultured in DMEM. the macrophage and epithelial cell co-cultures were established and infected. flow cytometry using 3-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF; Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) was assessed by using a LDH assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) commercially available ELISA kits were used to measure IL-1 and IL-18. Statistical analyses Student's t-test was used to assess statistical significance between means. significance (*) was set at p0.05. error bar represents mean standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. the mouse primary peritoneal macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage. lavage was performed without the thioglycollate induction. IL-6 and KC were measured from the culture medium. 50 l of Ad solution containing 11011 of viral particles was administered through intraperitoneal injection for the first two days of infection. the inhibitors were administered by intraperitoneal injection for the first two days of infection. Mice with more than 20% weight loss were euthanized. the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 (B) and KC (C), were measured by ELISA using the media obtained from MLE-J774 co-culture 24 h after infection with different doses of Ad. data are expressed as mean SD. kines, IL-1 is produced in the inactive form of pro-IL-1. the released ATP is sensed by P2X7R on the cell membrane. this changes allow inflammasome formation and activation of caspase-1. IL-1 is then secreted from the cell to induce various inflammatory responses."}
