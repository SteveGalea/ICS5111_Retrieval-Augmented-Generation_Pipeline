{"summary": "ventilation is recognized as an important factor influencing transmission of airborne diseases. increasing ventilation rates in classrooms, offices and homes is a relatively effective strategy for controlling airborne diseases in a large city. ventilation is defined as the supply/distribution or removal of air from space by mechanical or natural means (10) the role of ventilation in preventing airborne infections has drawn extensive attention since the SARS outbreak. the mechanism of dispersion of airborne droplets/droplet nuclei in space, the risk estimation of airborne infection, the role of airflow rate, the impact of airflow pattern, and etc. have been comprehensively explored in previous studies. pathogen-laden droplets are expelled into air while a patient sneezes, coughs, speaks, sings or simply breathes. there can be 40k to more than two million droplets released from a sneeze, compared to fewer than 100,000 from a cough. droplets of less than 100 m in diameter were found to evaporate very rapidly (17,25-27), leaving behind residue particles consisting of the dried solute. droplet nuclei can deeply penetrate into bronchi and deposit in lungs. wells exposed rabbits to the air with a known concentration of droplet nuclei containing single bovine tubercle bacilli. he also exposed rabbits to contaminated coarser particles produced by the atomized concentrated fluid. airborne transmission refers to the passage of pathogens from a source to a susceptible through airborne aerosols, resulting in infections (5). the risk of short-range airborne infection was much higher than that of long-range airborne infection when only the concentration of droplet nuclei was considered. the recommended minimum ventilation rate for airborne infection isolation rooms is 12 air change per hour (ACH) in most guidelines (29,36,37), then doubled after the 2003 SARS, while it is only 1 ACH for commercial buildings. the impact of ventilation rate on the cross infection of airborne transmitted diseases can be described by Wells-Riley Equation. the Wells-Riley equation successfully predicted a measles outbreak in a suburban school in USA (39). the equation indicates that ventilation rate can reduce the infection risk significantly. natural ventilation can deliver large ventilation rates with a low energy consumption. the impact of ventilation rate on the risk of short-range airborne diseases still needs further investigation. the impact of ventilation rate on the risk of short-range airborne diseases is not so obvious. the impact of ventilation rate on the risk of short-range airborne diseases still needs further investigation. different requirements of pressure difference or imbalance of airflow rate range from 2.5 to 15 Pa (29,36,37,52,53) the required pressure difference was 0.36 and 9.12 Pa for temperature difference only and for combination of wind and temperature respectively, when temperature was 10 \u00b0C. tested isolation rooms failed to provide a negative pressure (55-60) the main factors that broke up the negative pressure included inadequate reliability of pressure monitoring and controlling devices, strong diffuser flow directed at the door and poor airtightness of the suspended false ceiling (57). the controlled flow direction is generally designed to create a positive pressure in rooms and a negative pressure in toilets, whose goal is to control indoor temperature and pollutants. downward ventilation was recommended by several guidelines for isolation wards. a downward ventilation design is to supply cooler and heavier clean air from a ceiling diffuser with a low velocity. the heavier cold supply air is accelerated by negative thermal buoyancy to push airborne particles down. displacement ventilation showed a very high efficiency to remove exhaled pollutants. but when the infector faced horizontally, the exhaled jet could penetrate for a long distance. if the height of lock up layer was located in the breathing zone, the risk of long-range airborne transmission would also be high. PV-personalized exhaust (PV-PE) was developed for airborne infection control. the best one is the combination of a vertical desk grill and a top-personalized exhaust. results showed that it had a much higher efficiency than traditional central air conditioning systems did. an improved downward ventilation system was proposed. an improved ventilation system was proposed."}
