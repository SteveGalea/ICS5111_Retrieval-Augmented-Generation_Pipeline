{"summary": "the fusion process has been considered a significant antiviral target. a key step is the formation of a six-helix bundle of three heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 trimers of the fusion glycoproteins (1, 2, 3). the successful use of enfuvirtide against HIV has stimulated considerable efforts to develop more potent peptides. newly designed peptides based on the HR region of the fusion glycoproteins from different viruses have more potent antiviral activity than their mother HR peptides. these peptides can efficiently inhibit NDV and IBV infections. the peptide-resin mixture was washed with DMF (10 ml/g) once and with methanol (10 ml/g) and DMF (10 ml/g) twice and then lyophilized after removal of the Val protecting amino acid. the peptide precursor AU-resin mixture was dissolved in a DMF-dimethyl sulfoxide solution (2:1, vol/vol) before being mixed with a 3-fold molar excess of additional incubation was conducted with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 2% triisopropylsilane, and 5% water for 1.5 h at room temperature. final pellets were dried, resuspended in H2O and 20% acetonitrile, and lyophilized. experiments were performed in triplicate. the results are expressed as the averages of triplicates the standard deviations. clarified supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS with a reverse-phase high-performance LC column and an acetonitrile-water gradient system. the peaks were analyzed by MS with electrospray ionization in the multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. the thermal denaturation temperature was measured at 222 nm. assays for F activation, receptor retention, and receptor release. monolayers of HeLa cells transiently expressing the NDV fusion glycoprotein (F) and attachment glycoprotein (HN) were washed three times and incubated with 1% red blood cell suspensions at pH 7.5 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. 104 PFU of three strains of NDV (F48E9, Guangxi, and ND/03) and 50 PFU of three strains of IBV (H52, Conne, and H120) were used. each peptide was injected into the allantoic cavity of a 9-day-old SPF chicken egg before, after, or at the time of virus inoculation. 103 PFU of CEF-associated virus was injected into the yolk sacs of 6- to 7-day-old SPF chicken eggs. after 9 days of additional incubation, the surviving embryos were chilled overnight at 4\u00b0C and inspected for lesion formation. infected animals were observed daily for clinical signs (neurological signs and diet conditions) animals were isolated to avoid chickens pecking at each other. all of the experiments were completed in an isolated space. Cholesterol-tagged peptide (CAU) was prepared by chemoselective conjugation of the peptide AU and the cholesterol derivative of cholesteryl chloroformate. the peptide precursor AU-resin mixture was dissolved in a DMF-dimethyl sulfoxide solution (2:1, vol/vol) before being mixed with a 3-fold molar excess of cholesterol. cholesterol-tagged peptides were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the cells were incubated with a mixture of virus and increasing concentrations of the peptides. the cells were incubated with a mixture of virus and increasing concentrations of the peptides. for cell pretreatment, the cells were infected with virus for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. for posttreatment, the cells were infected with virus for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. the peptides were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the wavelength dependence of molar ellipticity was monitored from 195 to 245 nm at 25\u00b0C by an average of eight scans in a spectropolarimeter. the buffers were filtered in a vacuum pump system with 0.2-m membrane filters. monolayers of HeLa cells transiently expressing the NDV fusion glycoprotein (F) and attachment glycoprotein (HN) were washed three times and incubated with 1% red blood cell (RBC) suspensions at pH 7.5 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the plates were placed into a 37\u00b0C incubator for a prespecified time period. the liquid phase was collected in V-bottom tubes to measure the released RBCs. a mixture of the CDV with peptides at various concentrations was injected into the chorioallantoic membranes of 7-day-old SPF chicken eggs. after 6 days of additional incubation, pale spots and protuberances were observed under an Olympus microscope. the surviving embryos were chilled overnight at 4\u00b0C. a mixture of MDV with various peptides at a concentration of 0.25 mM in 60 l was injected into the yolk sacs and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 9 days. CAMs at day 9 postincubation were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. animals were isolated to avoid pecking at each other. the reaction was assessed by LC-MS, and the purity was >80%. AU peptide was modified with cholesterol or cholesterol and PEG3. the modified peptide was named CPAU, in which the cholesterol group and the AU peptide were linked by PEG3. Fig 1. Scheme used to synthesize the cholesterol-tagged peptide described in this report. a peak value of 170 nM in the plasma was observed at 4 h postinjection. the peptide quickly decreased to an undetectable level at 8 h postinjection. a peak value of 170 nM was observed at 4 h postinjection. CPAU, AU, and scrambled peptides were well folded and formed a typical -helical structure with double minima at 208 and 222 nm. if no interaction takes place between the two peptides, each peptide will keep its original structure. if no interaction takes place between the two peptides, then each peptide will keep its original structure. CD spectroscopy indicated that the CAU, AU, and scrambled peptides formed a typical helical structure, whereas CPAU kept an unfolded structure. mixed peptides demonstrated an obvious tendency to form helical structures, as opposed to each individual peptide solution. 53% of the RBCs were irreversibly bound in the presence of CAU at 30 min after zanamivir treatment. at that time, only 33 and 16% of the RBCs were irreversibly bound in the presence of the AU and scrambled peptides. two peptide modifications effectively protected chicken embryos from virus infection. we evaluated their antiviral effects in a model of chicken embryos 5, 17, 18. 100 CPAU 6 Dwar (+) 93 Scramble 18/12/6/0/6 Dwar (+++) 100 AU 6/0 Dwar () 87 Conne CPAU 18/12/6/0/6 Dwar (+++) 100 a Antiviral efficiency includes the postinfection time of peptide treatment, pathological changes caused by the virus in infected embryos, and the protective effect (percent) in embryos treated with scrambled peptides (severe hemorrhage, +++) both CAU and CPAU protected the embryos from NDV infection. the protective effect exceeded 93%. CPAU and CPAU peptides reduced dwarfism when given at 6 h p.i. AU provided similar protection to 100% of the embryos when administered at 6 or 0 h p.i. results showed that both CPAU and CPAU showed effective antiviral activity. all of the infected chickens survived over the period of the experiment (40 days) when treated with CAU. survival time was about 10 to 16 days when they were treated with scrambled peptides. only 40% of the chickens infected with 0.2 PFU of virus survived past day 40 p.i. with HI titers of 212. five groups of chickens were given the peptide CAU twice. the first dose was given 1 or 2 days before infection, the day of infection, or 1 or 2 days after infection. most of the infected chickens treated with the peptide survived approximately 3 to 5 days longer than those treated with scrambled peptides. inoculation with 100 l of a solution containing 200 PFU of NDV. injections were repeated three times at 3-day intervals. no adverse effects, such as diet changes, status, or body weight alterations, occurred in the tested animals. the synthetic scheme for the cholesterol-tagged peptide is shown in Fig. 1. the reaction was assessed by LC-MS, and the purity was >80%. the amino acid sequences of the AU peptides and scrambled peptides have the same sequences at the a, b, c, f, and g sites. CAU was inhibited by 75% in the presence of AU in a cell pretreatment assay. plaque formation was reduced approximately 70% in the presence of CAU and 14% in the presence of AU. the peptide AU was not found to penetrate the CNS. at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 h postinjection, the animals were sacrificed and the plasma and brain peptide concentrations were quantified. mixed peptides showed an obvious tendency to form helical structures. coiled-coil structures were more resistant to thermal denaturation than the parent AU-HR2 mixture. CD spectroscopy indicated that the peptides formed a typical helical structure. CAU, AU, and scrambled peptides inhibited RBC release by 50, 40, and 27% at 30 min after zanamivir treatment. most of the RBCs, however, were released by zanamivir in the absence of peptide. AU and scrambled peptides played a role in the early stage of membrane fusion. the peptide interfered with HN-F association. the modified peptides effectively protected chicken embryos from virus infection. 100 ND/03 CPAU 12/6/0 Hemo () 100 CPAU 18b Hemo (+) 27 Scramble 18/12/6/0/6 Hemo (+++) 100 IBV (104) H52 AU 6/0 Dwar () 100 CAU 12/6/0 Dwar () 87 CPAU 18/12/6/0 Dwar () 100 AU 6/0 Dwar () 100 CPAU 12/6/0 Dwar () 93 Scramble 18 each experiment was done three times with 5 eggs every time. about 20 to 27% of the infected animals treated with CPAU at 18 h p.i. survived for 140 h. virus-induced embryo dwarfism was observed in infected embryos. the scrambled peptide did not have any antiviral activity. CPAU also efficiently reduced dwarfism when given at 6 h p.i. the peptide dose was determined as 1.6 mg/kg. the peptides were given to chickens two times, at day 0 and day 6 p.i. all of the infected chickens survived over the period of the experiment. CPAU was less effective under this experimental condition. chickens were challenged by intranasal point eye inoculation with 100 l of a solution containing different dilutions of NDV and peptide administration. five groups of chickens (five per group) were given the peptide CAU twice. most of the infected chickens treated with the peptide survived approximately 3 to 5 days longer than those treated with scrambled peptides. chickens were challenged by intranasal point eye inoculation with 100 l of a solution containing 200 PFU of NDV. in vivo tests showed that even at 5 mg/kg, no adverse effects, such as diet changes, status, or body weight alterations, occurred. a series of systematic replacements with glutamic acid (E) or lysine (K) were made at solvent sites b, c, f, and g to design the peptide. the peptide is focused on mutations at d and e sites, which lend support to the suggestion that AU and its derivatives could be used to control outbreaks of existing virus serotypes. cholesterol-tagged peptide CAU can penetrate the avian CNS. covalent modification with PEG, a nontoxic polymer commonly used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical preparations for over 60 years, can profoundly influence the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic profiles. the cholesterol-tagged peptide crosses the blood-brain barrier. it can induce severe encephalitic lesions at approximately 10 days p.i (20, 21) the design of peptide AU, which can cross into the CNS, could provide better therapeutics. a synthetic HR1-HR2 peptide can bind to endogenous HR2-HR1 in the intermediate state after the fusion peptide is inserted into the target membrane (3, 4, 5). if a specific orientation of the peptide on the cell surface is required to block the refolding of the fusion glycoprotein, only the C-terminal peptide would be properly oriented to maximize the interaction with HR1. modification through the use of cholesterol at the N terminus of the peptide results in potent antiviral activity in the two types of in vivo models. the results indicate that these new chemical modifications are effective and can extend the in vivo half-life of the peptide. cholesterol conjugation of antiviral peptides could be useful for viruses that fuse in the endosomal compartment, such as influenza virus, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane. a cholesterol-tagged peptide can interact with the F glycoprotein of paramyxovirus before the fusion peptide is inserted into the target cell membrane. cholesterol-tagged peptide CAU must have undergone a conformational change to expose the HR1 and HR2 regions. the cholesterol-tagged peptide captures this transitional intermediate. this is worthy of further exploration, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the cholesterol-tagged peptide CAU plays a role at two different stages of membrane fusion. infected animals treated 1 day before a challenge exhibited 70% protection against disease for at least 30 days p.i. a total of four peptide injections instead of a daily injection is a desirable scheme. modified peptides can effectively inhibit existing virus serotypes of NDV and IBV infections. both CAU and CPAU protected the embryos from infection with three different serotypes of NDV or IBV. the protection effects varied from 87 to 100% for different virus strains. the interaction probability between the AU peptide and HR2 of other NDV strains was analyzed with the Coils software. CPAU inhibited IBV infections 12 h prior to virus inoculation. the longest-acting peptide was CPAU, which effectively inhibited IBV infection by >93% from 18 h preinfection to 6 h p.i. cholesterol is involved in the life cycle of many viruses. cell membrane cholesterol contributes to virus entry into cells. cellular cholesterol may be required for optimal cell entry in the NDV infection cycle. N-terminal tagging of a peptide with cholesterol produces a 50-fold decrease in antiviral activity against human parainfluenza virus type 3 of the Paramyxoviridae family. the different effectiveness of tagging at the N terminus could be influenced by the kinetics of fusion glycoprotein activation (12). the different effectiveness of tagging could be influenced by the kinetics of fusion glycoprotein activation (12). equimolar mixtures of peptide AU and HR2 have more obvious -helical structures than the HR1-HR2 complex. results support the possibility that AU blocks the formation of the six-helix bundle, thereby inhibiting virus infection by competitive combination with the endogenous HR2 region. a cholesterol-tagged peptide can interact with the F glycoprotein of paramyxovirus before the fusion peptide is inserted into the target cell membrane. this supports the notion that a cholesterol moiety group may localize the HR-mimetic peptide to the cell membrane and create a protective antiviral shield to target the earlier stage of the activation process. extensive research will be conducted into viruses beyond the Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Retroviridae, and Herpesviridae families. the peptide is able to block viral infection at a postattachment entry step in vitro by 58% at a concentration of 12 nM. animals infected with 200 PFU of NDV and administered the peptide CAU on day 2 p.i. were protected and >50% survived cholesterol modification and peptide injection may be applied to other peptide agents."}
