{"summary": "alphaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with an envelope structure belonging to the family of Togaviridae. certain alphaviruses have been associated with pathogenicity, resulting in global fever epidemics. several alphaviruses, including SFV [5], Sindbis virus (SIN) [6] and VEE [7] have been subjected to the engineering of vectors for heterologous gene expression. all alphavirus vectors described take advantage of the extremely efficient RNA replication. 200,000 RNA copies from each RNA molecule can be produced. there is still a marginal risk of the generation of replication-proficient particles through non-homologous recombination. viral and tumor antigens have been administered in various animal models. non-viral pathogens have been subjected to vaccine development. a number of approaches have been initiated for immunization against alphavirus-based infections.

SFV vectors were employed for the expression of the Plasmodium falciparum Pf332 antigen, which elicited immunological memory in vaccinated mice. tus IF3 SFV/Particles Mouse Brucella protection [69] Malaria CS SIN/Particles Mouse Malaria protection [71] M. tuberculosis Ag85A SIN/DNA Mouse Protection [67] Prion NP SFV/Particles-RNA Mouse Immunological memory [66] Staphylococcus enterotoxin B VEE/Particles Mouse Protection [73] Abbreviations: Abs, antibodies; SFV noma differentiation antigen (MDA) tyrosine encoding tyrosine related protein 2 (TRP-2) relied on a novel immune mechanism, which required the activation of both IgG and CD8+ cell effector responses. the vaccine encoding tyrosine related protein 2 (TRP-2) relied on a novel immune mechanism. 203 SFV/Particles Mouse Tumor protection [94] Kidney cancer IL-12 SFV/Encapsulated particles Human Phase I 5-fold IL-12 expression [95] Melanoma MDA/trp-2 VEE/Particles Mouse Therapeutic effect [76] IL-12 SFV/Particles Mouse Tumor eradication [96] IL-12 SFV/Encapsulated particles Human Phase I 5-fold IL-12 expression [95] MUC18/MCAM vaccination with recombinant particles expressing the P1A gene [105] and the human papilloma virus (HPV) E7 gene [89] provided protection against further tumor development in mice. attempts have also been made to improve the efficacy of SFV-based HPV vaccines. pSINCP/neu DNA and VEE/neu particles were administered after injection of 5 mg/kg of doxorubicin. this phenomenon did not occur for doxorubicin alone. combination of dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy with pSINCP/neu particle administration induced both cellular and humoral immunity against neu. intramuscular immunization elicited immune responses at doses 100- to 1,000-fold lower for the SIN DNA replicon vector compared to the conventional CMVpromoter-based DNA-LacZ vector. SFV particles providing VEGFR-2 expressing in vaccinated mice inhibited CT26 colon carcinoma growth. gene was fused to the secretory Sig protein and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), enhanced E7specific CD4+ helper T-cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activity was induced. Vaccinations generated antigen-specific immune responses, an antiangiogenic effect and a strong anti-tumor activity. also, vaccination induced long-term memory. -tumor protection was observed in 90% of vaccinated animals. a chimeric Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE) were applied. a chimeric Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and WEE virus were applied.
