{"summary": "Specimens and demographic and clinical data were collected from adults admitted with respiratory symptoms to 4 hospitals during the 8\u201310 peak weeks of 2 influenza seasons. results At least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 46% (21% influenza, 25% noninfluenza; 2% coinfection) of the 286 enrolled patients in 2011\u20132012 and in 62% (46% influenza, 16% noninfluenza; 3% coinfection) patients eligible for study participation were those with cough, sore throat, or fever/feverishness of unknown etiology in 2011\u20132012. patients with respiratory symptom onset >72 hours after hospital admission were considered to have healthcare-associated (HA) infection. Luminex RVP FAST version 1 assay detects influenza A (subtypes H3 and seasonal H1); influenza B; hPIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; hMPV; common CoVs (NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43); enterovirus/rhinovirus (not differentiated) patients with respiratory symptom onset >72 hours after hospital admission were considered to have healthcare-associated (HA) infection. specimens from all swabbed patients admitted for 24 hours were sent to the provincial public health laboratory. patients recruited during the peak influenza period defined as consecutive weeks with at least 15% of the weekly samples. laboratory analysis Nasal specimens collected on flocked swabs were tested by Luminex RVP FAST version 1 assay which detects influenza A (subtypes H3 and seasonal H1), influenza B; hPIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; hMPV; common CoVs (NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43) there were 935 adult admissions with respiratory ICD-10-CM codes J00\u2013J99 in participating hospitals during the study period in 2011\u20132012 (43% swabbed); 1059 (72% swabbed) in 2012\u20132013. the most frequent conditions were chronic heart disease (42%\u201352%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (42%\u201352%). = 170 N = 286 n = 92 n = 304 N = 396 Male sex 65 (56) 87 (51) 152 (53) 41 (45) 136 (45) 177 (45)a Underlying medical conditionb 88 (76) 159 (94)c 247 (86) 71 (77) 268 (88)d 339 (86) Admitted with fever and cough or sore throate 83 (72) 111 (65) 194 (68) 55 5 (0\u201326) Death 4 (3) 14 (8) 18 (6) 1 (1) 25 (8)d 26 (7) Data are No. (%) of cases unless specified otherwise. totals may differ slightly from the number presented in the column. 59 (39)a,e 5\u20137 days 11 (18) 22 (31) 30 (19) 28 (15) 10 (16) 31 (21) 8 days 6 (10) 11 (15) 37 (24) 34 (19) 21 (33) 40 (27) Seasonal influenza vaccine Yes 28 (46) 48 (68) 92 (60)c 80 (44) 40 (64) 82 (55)e No 31 (51) 62 (40) 91 (50) 18 (29) 57 (38) Antibiotics received 48 (79) 70 (99) 143 influenza and ORVs were detected in 26% (51/194) and 29% (56/194) in 2011\u20132012; 49% (109/221) and 15% (34/221) in 2012\u20132013. influenza and ORVs were detected in 26% (44% single, 2% coinfections) of patients in 2011\u20132012. of Patients 2011\u20132012 2012\u20132013 Age Group, y Overall N = 286 Age Group, y Overall N = 396 18\u201364 n = 116 65\u201374 n = 63 75 n = 107 18\u201364 n = 92 65\u201374 n = 77 75 n = 227 Detected virus (including coinfectionsa) Influenza A or B 33 (28) 14 (22) 15 (14) 62 (22) 38 (41) 29 (38) 116 (51) 183 data are No. (%) of cases unless specified otherwise. hMPV, human metapneumovirus; hPIV, human parainfluenza virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.

LOS in the ICU was longer in patients with influenza and ORVs than in patients with no detected virus in 2012\u20132013. in 2012\u20132013, 7 of the 26 (27%) deceased patients had a confirmed influenza infection. they had a median age of 80 years (range, 76\u201394 years); all of them had underlying medical conditions. case fatality with influenza (4%) was not statistically different than with ORVs (10%: 2 RSV, 2 enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, 1 hMPV, 1 hPIV3) influenza was the cause of adult respiratory hospitalization (n = 62) whereas influenza was the cause of adult respiratory hospitalization (n = 72) more than twice as often as ORV (n = 74) during peak influenza weeks of the 2012\u20132013 season. more adult patients were hospitalized with ORV (n = 72) than with influenza (n = 62) if we had tested patients during the entire winter season or year round, the overall proportion of ORV compared to influenza would likely have been even higher. if we had tested patients during the entire winter season or year round, the overall proportion of ORV compared to influenza would likely have been even higher. the 8 peak weeks of the 2012\u20132013 influenza season included in the study corresponded to the influenza A peak (Figure 1) and represented 73% of the influenza viruses detected by provincial sentinel laboratories from November to May of that year. both adults and children contribute to sentinel surveillance data for influenza, but it is likely that children disproportionately drive RSV findings in the community. influenza was not associated with more severe disease when compared to RSV and hMPV in other prospective studies [11, 26], and was even lower when compared to RSV and hPIV in the elderly in 1 study with indirect ecological estimation [4]. influenza-positive specimens were collected earlier and were associated with greater antiviral use and lower antibiotic use than ORV-positive or influenza-negative specimens. at 7\u201314 days, compared to 51% at 1\u20136 days after symptoms onset. at least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 13% of participants in 2011\u20132012. Luminex test used in our study may have a slightly lower sensitivity compared to other PCR tests. significant variations in morbidity attributable to influenza vs ORVs during the 2 seasons of the current study illustrate the hazards associated with attributing the burden of influenza based on clinical or administrative data alone. this conclusion is consistent with a recent review of 43 studies by Thomas [40] showing that 25% of patients with ILI have influenza."}
