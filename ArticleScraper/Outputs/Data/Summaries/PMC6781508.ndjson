{"summary": "infectious agents causing lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis were ranked in the top ten causes of death worldwide, resulting in 5.7 million deaths in 2016 (1). it is clear that we need a suitable animal model that can most accurately mimic the pathogenesis of infection. only in vivo models can accurately assess the complexity of host responses and allow the efficacy and adverse effects of drugs or vaccine to be evaluated. the hamster model has emerged as the only small animal model permissive for Adenovirus (AdV) infection. the number of publications using Syrian hamsters as an animal model from 1997 through 2017 is shown. the number of publications using Syrian hamsters as an animal model from 1997 through 2017 is shown. Flaviviruses West Nile virus WT West Nile neurological syndrome (13) Yellow fever virus* WT Yellow fever (14) Zika virus STAT2/ Zika virus disease (15) Japanese encephalitis (17) Eastern equine encephalitis virus WT Eastern equine encephalitis (18) Western equine encephalitis virus WT Western equine encephalitis (20) Filoviruses Ebola virus* WT Ebola virus disease (21) Mar WNV is a member of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), an emerging zoonotic arbovirus widely distributed throughout the world (38). in humans, the majority of WNV infections are asymptomatic, with only 20% of infected individuals developing symptomatic west Nile fever (WNF) hamsters were shown to develop chronic viremia and sustained renal infection for 8 months (50) by observing the pathogenesis of disease in an immunosuppressed cancer patient infected with WNV. the animals showed similar clinical signs to those observed in an immunosuppressed patient infected with WNV. adapted viral strains (Asibi/hamster p7) allow the reproduction of yellow fever disease in hamsters with features similar to the human disease (59). studies have also shown that infection of Syrian hamster results in immune responses that correspond to those observed in infected humans. increased levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of TGF- in the liver, spleen, and heart. Nipah Virus Nipah is paramyxovirus of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) with a high fatality rate (69) infection in humans usually causes severe encephalitic and respiratory disease (70) pathological lesions are the most severe and extensive in the hamster brain. pathological lesions are the most severe and extensive in the hamster brain. pita et al. discovered purified NiV-like particles (VLP) can protect the hamster using either multiple-dose or single-dose vaccination regimens followed by NiV challenge (81). EBOV is one of five known viruses within the genus Ebolavirus (family Filoviridae) (10) it's classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen. hamsters inoculated with HA-MARV developed hemorrhagic manifestations, coagulation abnormalities, dysregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines MIP-1 and IP-10. in the study, hamsters developed hemorrhagic manifestations, coagulation abnormalities, dysregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines MIP-1 and IP-10, and increment of type I interferon responses. the adenosine analog, galidesivir (BCX4430) can effectively reduce the RVFV titer in infected Syrian hamsters (96). other Viruses A large number of other studies have also demonstrated that Syrian hamster is a permissive small animal model for other viruses. in humans, the majority of WNV infections are asymptomatic. in humans, only 20% of infected individuals develop symptomatic west Nile fever (WNF) (39) however, WNV is an important emerging neurotropic virus causing severe encephalitis in human posing a significant threat to global health. antibody immunoprophylaxis induced by delivery of recombinant antigens (WN-80E or WN-NS1) also protected Syrian hamster from WNV infection (51) using a Syrian hamster model, Widman et al. successfully demonstrated that RepliVAX WN, a single cycle flavivirus vaccine platform, was able to induce durable protective immunity. studies found increased levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of TGF- in the liver, spleen, and heart in early and mid-stages of infection (60). treatment with anti-viral compounds 2\u2032-C-methyl cytidine (61), T-1106 (62), IFN alfacon-1 (63), and BCX4430 (64) can significantly improve hamster survival. lesions are the most severe and extensive in the hamster brain and viral antigen and RNA can be detected in neurons (11), lung (71), kidney, and spleen (11) the hamsters in the majority of NiV infection studies are treated by intraperitoneal injection or intranasal (IN.) delivery. the model was used as a platform for evaluation of vaccines for NiV (77\u201380) hamsters could be inoculated via intraperitoneal injection with mouse adapted Zaire Ebola virus (MA-ZEBOV) pathology caused by this infection is similar to that of humans, which includes significant spleen and liver damage, cytokine dysregulation, severe coagulopathy, lymphocyte apoptosis. atkins et al. recently developed a small animal model for wild-type MARV infection using STAT2 KO Syrian hamster. viral replication rapidly progresses to multiorgan infection and extensive viremia (23), demonstrating STAT2 as a host factor affecting wild-type MARV infection. Syrian hamster model was successfully used to test the efficacy of anti-F MAbs to reduce Hendra virus infection. hamster has successfully been characterized for infection of human influenza. spira leptospirosis (102) Helicobacter spp. disease (103) Entamoeba histolytica WT Amebic liver abscess (104, 105) Leishmania WT Visceral Leishmania (106) Leptospira interrogan Pathogenic Leptospira interrogans is spirochete bacteria responsible for leptospirosis. a vaccine using a conserved region of the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like B protein (LigB, 131\u2013645) and aluminum hydroxide (AH) can significantly increase IgG and IgM levels in the hamster, protecting the animal from mortality after challenge (114). hamsters were conditioned with a single subcutaneous injection of clindamycin to induce Clostridium difficile colitis model. infected animals demonstrate up-regulated expression of Th1-associated cytokine mRNA, such as IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in the spleen, but limited induction of IL-4 mRNA (126). in murine models, leishmania is controlled through nitric oxide (NO) generation, but in hamsters, as in humans, NO does not have a role in macrophage function. study found increased levels of IgG in hamsters infected with leishmania infantum (130) hamsters can develop progressive fatal disease, with major sites of parasites replication being the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, eventually causing death of the host. the same animal model used for Entamoeba histolytica infection was used to show that baculovirus driving the expression of the Gal-Lectin LC3 fragment increased IFN and IL-4 levels in the liver. Schistosoma haematobium is the etiologic agent for urogenital schistosomiasis, a source of morbidity and mortality for over 112 million people worldwide. granulomata with multiple eggs in the center were observed in the liver and urinary bladder with the preponderance of CD8+ positive T cells in the liver (95 and 115 days PI) in this model, high dose PZQ was clearly curative from 75 days PI. leptospira interrogan pathogenic Leptospira interrogans is spirochete bacteria responsible for leptospirosis, a widespread neglected zoonotic. the presence of leptospira interrogans can be detected in liver and kidney, with the destruction of hepatocyte junctions. the use of mouse animal model has been unable to provide CDI drug discoveries. hamsters were conditioned with clindamycin to induce Clostridium difficile colitis model. leishmania donovani Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum (124) induction of IL-4 mRNA was not detected in livers or spleen of hamsters. recombinant leishmania donovani protein disulfide isomerase (rLdPDI) generated a robust cellular immune response with increased iNOS transcription and TNF-, IFN-, and IL-12 levels. infection of the hamsters showed a strong humoral response against leishmania antigens, and high antibody levels (131). study have tested the LJM19 (Immunization with 16 DNA plasmids coding for salivary proteins of Lu. longipalpis) protein protected hamsters against the fatal outcome of VL (132). hMSP-1 immunization stimulated a robust IgG antibody response, IgG bound to the surface of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. baculovirus driving the expression of the Gal-Lectin LC3 fragment increased IFN and IL-4 levels in the liver to protect against ALA (138) hamsters were used to study articular manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. infected animals have up-regulated expression of type II cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), down-regulation of IL-12 and up-regulation of the type II chemokine CCL17. studies focus on several infectious pathogens including those of viral, parasitic, and bacterial origins. the results indicate that the Syrian hamster immune response is more physiological similar to the human immune response when compared to other animals. increased research efforts will ultimately allow for the development of new technologies and tools to study the Syrian hamster. af-1 antibody WB (152) Bax Anti-Bax antibody WB, IHC (152) Bcl-2 Anti-Bcl-2 antibody WB, IHC (152) Bcl-xL Anti-Bcl-xL antibody WB (153) Caspase-2L Anti-Caspase-2L antibody WB (152) Caspase-3 Anti-Caspase-3 antibody WB, IHC (152) Caspase-8 Anti-Caspas Iba-1 antibody IHC (159) MARCO Anti-hamster MARCO (PAL-1) antibody IHC, Flow Cyt (164) Mcl-1 Anti-Mcl-1 antibody WB (165) MHC II Anti-mouse I-Ek MHC II (14-4-4S) antibody Flow Cyt (166) MMP Anti-MMP antibody WB (154) MMP-2 Anti-MMP-2 antibody WB, IHC (152, 167) MMP-9 Anti-MMP-9 author contributions JM, ZW, and YW: manuscript concept and design. conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
