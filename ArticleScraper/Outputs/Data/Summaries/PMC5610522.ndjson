{"summary": "hepatitis B virus chronically infects 240 million people worldwide. 686,000 people die annually due to hepatitis B and its related cirrhosis. evasion of the innate immune response by HBV has been considered to play a critical role in viral pathogenesis. many studies have suggested that expression of HBV core protein, polymerase, HBx, or envelope proteins inhibits TLR3 (9, 10), TLR9 (11, 12), RIG-I (13, 14) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) (15) signal transduction pathways. cGAS-STING pathway may play a role in restriction of HBV replication in hepatocytes. hepatoma cells and immortalized mouse hepatocytes express low levels of STING and have a functional STING signaling pathway. cGAS-STING pathway is not inhibited by HBV in the context of viral replication. functional cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathway in HepAD38 cells. cGAS transcription and subsequent DNA replication are regulated by a tetracycline (TET) inducible promoter. expression of cGAS and STING proteins in the cells was confirmed by a Western blot assay. the expression of cGAS and STING in the indicated cells was detected by Western blotting assays with antibodies against cGAS and STING. the indicated cells were mock transfected or transfected with dsDNA90 and fixed 7 h posttransfection. removal of TET from the culture medium induced the increase of HBV pgRNA and core DNA in either HepAD38/cGAS-STING or HepAD38/cGAS-STINGC cells in a time-dependent manner. however, the levels of HBV pgRNA and core DNA in either the cells did not significantly differ from that in parental HepAD38 cells. each of the indicated cell lines was cultured in the presence or absence of TET for 3 and 5 days. levels of HBV pgRNA (A), cytoplasmic HBV core DNA (B), IFN- mRNA (D), IL-29 mRNA (E) and CXCL10 mRNA (F) were determined by qPCR assays. treatment of HepG2 and HepAD38 cells with cGAMP induced a type III IFN-dominant cytokine response. cytokine mRNA levels peaked at 2 to 4 h posttreatment. the levels of STING mRNA and protein were measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays. both parental AML12 and AML12HBV10 cells expressed low but detectable levels of STING compared to RAW246.7 cells. ML12 and AML12HBV10 cells cultured in the presence or absence of TET were determined by a qRT-PCR assay. the levels of STING protein in each of the cells were normalized to -actin mRNA and are expressed as the fold of induction over that in mock-treated AML12 cells. the extent and kinetics of cGAMP-induced cytokine mRNA expression did not significantly differ in HepAD38 (Fig. 5B to F) with (TET) or without (TET+) active HBV replication. a similar observation was obtained in AML12HBV10 cells. treatment of AML12HBV10 cells with conditioned media of cGAMP- or DMXAA, but not DMXAA, effectively inhibited HBV DNA replication. direct treatment of AML12HBV10 cells with 500, 165, and 55 M DMXAA dose dependently reduced HBV DNA. intracellular HBV core DNA levels were quantified by a qPCR assay. means and standard deviations are presented (n = 3). AK1 inhibitors abolished IFN- suppression of HBV replication. cGAMP- and DMXAA-induced HBV DNA reduction in the cells. DMXAA inhibition of HBV replication in mouse hepatocytes is STING dependent. plasmid expressing Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) specific to mouse STING was cultured in the absence or presence of TET for 2 days. the cells were mock treated or treated with 500 M DMXAA or 10 g/ml cGAMP for 4 h. the cells were harvested 2 days after treatment. line C3AhNTCP supports de novo HBV infection. infected cells were infected with HBV at an MOI of 500 genome equivalents. cGAMP induces a robust cytokine response and inhibits viral replication. cccDNA, pgRNA, and core DNA levels were determined by qPCR assays. cytokine mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR assays. findings presented as fold induction over mock-treated controls. cccDNA (I), pgRNA (J) and core DNA (K) were quantified by qPCR assays. expression of cGAS and STING in human hepatoma cells reconstituted a functional DNA-sensing pathway. expression of cGAS and STING proteins in the cells was confirmed by a Western blot assay. transfection of dsDNA90, a well-known cGAS ligand (31), only induced STING translocation, nuclear import of IRF3 and mRNA expression of IFN-, interleukin-29 (IL-29 [or IFN-1]) in HepAD38/cGAS-STING cells, but not in parental HepAD38 cells. ectopic expression of cGAS and/or STING increased basal levels of cytokin parental HepAD38, HepAD38/cGAS-STING, and HepAD38/cGAS-STING cells were cultured in the presence or absence of TET for 3 and 5 days. however, the levels of HBV pgRNA and core DNA in either HepAD38/cGAS-STING or HepAD38/cGAS-STINGC cells did not significantly differ from that in parental HepAD38 cells. dsDNA90 induction of cytokine response in cells cultured in the presence or absence of TET for 5 days. culturing of cells in the absence of TET for 5 days induced high levels of HBV replication. however, HBV replication had no effect on the magnitude of dsDNA90-induced upregulation of IL-29 and CXCL10. the levels of HBV core DNA in pretransfected cells (G) and IL-29 mRNA (H) and CXCL10 mRNA (I) at 12 h posttransfection were determined by qPCR assays. the cells were then reseeded at a density of 5 105 cells per well of a 12-well plate. a stable cell line expressing human STING (HepAD38/hSTING) was used as a positive control. one-tenth of the cell lysate from HepAD38/hSTING cells was loaded. the levels of mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR assays. both parental AML12 and AML12HBV10 cells expressed low but detectable levels of STING compared to RAW246.7 cells. treatment of the cells with either cGAMP (Fig. 4C) or mouse STING agonist 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) dose dependently induced the expression of IFN- mRNA. replication does not inhibit STING agonist induced cytokine response. it was reported previously that HBV polymerase protein disrupts STING signaling by physical association with STING. however, such an effect was observed under the condition of polymerase protein and STING overexpression in human hepatoma cells. IL-28A (D), IL-28B (E) and TNF- (F) mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR assays and normalized to -actin mRNA. mRNA are expressed as the fold of induction over that in mock-treated cells. treatment of AML12HBV10 cells with conditioned media of cGAMP- or DMXAA, but not DMXAA, effectively inhibited HBV replication. the culture medium from the treated cells was diluted with fresh medium at 1:1 and then applied to AML12HBV10 cells for 2 days. levels of intracellular HBV core DNA were quantified by a qPCR assay. TRIF-mediated innate immune response in human hepatoma cells induces cytokine-independent intracellular antiviral response against HBV (35). TRIF-mediated innate immune response in human hepatoma cells induces cytokine-independent intracellular antiviral response against HBV. cGAMP and DMXAA inhibition of HBV replication in mouse hepatocytes is STING dependent. both cGAMP and DMXAA inhibition of HBV replication in the mouse hepatocytes is STING dependent. gRNA, pregenomic RNA; envRNA, viral mRNAs specifying envelope proteins were determined by Southern blotting hybridization (lower panel). rcDNA, relaxed circular DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. treatment of C3AhNTCP cells with cGAMP induced a robust cytokine response. cGAMP induces a robust cytokine response and inhibits viral replication in hepatocytes. the infected cells were fixed at 3 and 7 days postinfection (dpi) and HBV core protein was detected by indirect immunofluorescent staining (red) the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) proteinized (DP)-rcDNA into ssDNA followed by restriction with EcoRI to convert cccDNA into unit-length double-stranded linear DNA. a 3.2-kb unit length and a 2.0-kb HBV linear DNA served as size markers. HBV RNA levels, including pgRNA and viral mRNAs specifying envelope proteins, were determined by Southern blotting hybridization. lack of HBV DNA in the cytoplasm may be responsible for the evasion of cGAS sensing. however, whether HBV DNA is capable of binding to and activating cGAS or any other DNA sensors remains to be determined. hepatocytes are the primary host cells of HBV. HBV is not a cytopathic virus and is thus able to persistently replicate in hepatocytes. cytopathic and noncytopathic antiviral mechanisms contribute to the clearance of HBV during acute infection. activation of STING in liver-resident immune regulatory cells and hepatocytes induces a cytokine response that suppresses HBV replication. antiviral cytokine response may also reduce viral antigen load through elimination or transcriptional suppression of cccDNA, which may attenuate the T cell exhaustion.
