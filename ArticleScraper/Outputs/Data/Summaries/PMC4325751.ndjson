{"summary": "in the 2013-2014 season, influenza A virus (IAV) was widespread in all 50 states, accounting for deaths of children and adults. in the 2013-2014 season, IAV was widespread in all 50 states, accounting for deaths of children and adults. an experimental antiviral drug targeting NS1 exploits these pathways, inhibiting virus replication in an RNase L-dependent manner (12). despite the impact of RNase L during IAV infections, the exact mechanisms by which RNase L restricts IAV replication remain to be determined. endoribonuclease cleavage sites were detected in each segment of IAV RNA, in both genomic and antigenomic strands. RNA sequences associated with alternate reading frames (ARFs), alternative splicing (3) and virion RNA packaging (19, 20) IAVNS1 was grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% bovine albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 g/ml of l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylmethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) (21). lentiviruses expressing either control nonmammalian short hairpin RNA (s cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. cells were infected with IAV or IAVNS1 at a multiplicity of infection. rRNA cleavage was monitored on RNA chips with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cell lysates (30 g protein) were fractionated by SDS\u201310% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. RNA (NR_046235.1), 5S rRNA (NR_023371.1), U6 snRNA (NR_046491.1) and other 16S and 12S mitochondrial rRNAs, U1/U2/U4/U5/U6atac snRNAs, U3 snoRNA, 7SL and 7SK RNAs, RNase MRP RNA, hg18 tRNAs, and the human genome build 36.1 ( canine kidney epithelium (MDCK) and human lung epithelium (A549) cell lines were purchased from ATCC. A549 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) lentiviruses were detected in the presence of 8 g/ml polybrene (Life Technologies) twenty clones expressing control or RNase L shRNA were screened as follows. rRNA cleavage was monitored on RNA chips with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer as described previously (22). cell suspensions from 10 identical biological replicates (control or RNase L shRNA) were mixed together. 2.5 nM each cDNA library (uninfected plus control shRNA/uninfected plus RNase L shRNA/IAVNS1-infected plus RNase L shRNA) were pooled into one run. aligned data were converted to bedgraph (26) the frequency of endonuclease cleavage sites was plotted against the nucleotide position of each genome with Microsoft Excel or R. the amount of cleavage at each site in host and viral RNAs was normalized as follows: % total cDNA reads =. rRNA fragments were absent from both uninfected cells and wild-type IAV-infected cells where NS1 was expressed normally. knockdown of RNase L expression dramatically diminished the cleavage of rRNA in IAVNS1-infected cells and in poly(IC)-transfected cells. cDNA libraries were made with RNA from uninfected and IAVNS1-infected A549 cells/control (Ctrl) and RNase L shRNA-treated cells. cDNA libraries from uninfected and IAVNS1-infected A549 cells/control (Ctrl) and RNase L shRNA-treated cells were used. cleavage sites were found in host and viral RNAs. UMIs were used during cDNA synthesis (27), allowing us to count the cleavage events in host and viral RNAs. more than 10% of all cleavage events were in IAV RNAs in control shRNA-treated cells. rRNAs have more cleavage sites than any other RNA in cells. PB2, PB1 and PA RNAs are likely to be abundant at these times. this is not surprising to see relatively large amounts of cleavage in these large IAV RNA segments. UA, UU, and UG dinucleotides were frequent sites of cleavage within IAV RNAs. RNase L knockdown reduced cleavage at UA and UU dinucleotides. significant amounts of cleavage were evident after pyrimidines. control shRNA (dark gray bars) or RNase L shRNA (light gray bars) cleavage sites mapped to discrete regions within IAV RNAs, often within and adjacent to areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. cleavage sites mapped to discrete regions within IAV RNAs. in IAV negative-strand (blue bars) and positive-strand (red bars) RNAs are plotted alongside synonymous-site conservation (SSC) a dashed line indicates an SSC obs/exp ratio of 1. Cleavage sites from IAVNS1-infected control shRNA-treated A549 cells are shown. PB2 negative-strand RNA was cleaved in a discrete region spanning nucleotides 250 to 650. PB1 RNA was cleaved frequently in both the negative and positive strands. HA and NA RNAs had limited amounts of endonucleolytic cleavage compared to other IAV RNA segments. cleavage sites lie within an area of increased synonymous-site conservation (Fig. 5, M RNA), 50 bases downstream from the M4 splice donor sequence (Fig. 7) other areas of increased synonymous-site conservation had little to no endonucleolytic cleavage (e.g., 3\u2032 ends of PB2, PB1, and M segments) 28S rRNA cleavage at CU4031 and UG4032 was provoked specifically in IAVNS1-infected cells. however, cleavage at these sites was not diminished significantly by RNase L knockdown, preventing attribution to RNase L activity. the percentages of the total cDNA reads at the 20 most frequent cleavage sites in the 18S rRNA are shown. in IAVNS1-infected control shRNA-treated A549 cells, there was 5-fold greater cleavage than in uninfected control shRNA-treated cells. rNase L restricts IAV replication and leads to rRNA cleavage when NS1 protein is deleted. the magnitudes of IAV replication were consistent with these observations. wild-type IAV replicated equally well in both control and RNase L shRNA-treated cells. IAVNS1 replication was restricted in control shRNA-treated cells. cDNA libraries were made with RNA from uninfected and IAVNS1-infected A549 cells/control (Ctrl) and RNase L shRNA-treated cells. cDNA libraries from uninfected and IAVNS1-infected control shRNA-treated cells were used to detect endoribonucleolytic cleavage. 28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs and U6 snRNA accounted for a large portion of the cleavage sites. more than 10% of all cleavage events were in IAV RNAs in control shRNA-treated cells.

Discrete regions of PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and M RNA segments accounted for the majority of the cleavage events within IAV RNAs. the observed to expected ratio of synonymous-site conservation allows direct comparison across different IAV RNA segments. the locations of the M1 open reading frame (ORF), the M42 ARF, the M4 intron, the M4 splice donor (m4SD) sequence, and the RNA structure described by Moss et al. (38) are shown. PB2 negative-strand RNA was cleaved in a discrete region spanning nucleotides 250 to 650. PB1 RNA was cleaved frequently in both the negative and positive strands. the endonuclease cleavage sites in PB1 coincide with areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. endoribonucleolytic cleavage was prominent in some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation (e.g., PB1-F2 ARF, M segment splice junction, PA-X ARF in negative strand) other areas of increased synonymous-site conservation had little to no endonucleolytic cleavage. the human ribosome structures shown are from Anger et al. (54) the frequency and location of cleavage sites in the 18S (A) and 28S (B) rRNAs are shown. DISCUSSION RNase L is a key effecter of type I interferon-regulated antiviral responses (39) in recent years, viral countermeasures to RNase L have been described, reinforcing the important nature of this host defense mechanism for picornaviruses (40, 41), coronaviruses (42), rotaviruses (43), and influenza viruses (11) RNase A cleaves viral RNA at single-stranded pyrimidines, whereas RNase L cleaves RNA predominantly at single-stranded UG dinucleotides. we have detected cleavage sites in single-stranded bulges and loops throughout large structured host and viral RNAs. U6 snRNA has abundant amounts of cyclic phosphate at its 3\u2032 end because of the enzymatic activity of hUSB1 in cells or in vivo (14, 45) cyclic phosphates specifically at the 3\u2032 end of this cellular RNA function as a positive control in each cDNA library. cyclic phosphates specifically at the 3\u2032 end of this cellular RNA function as a positive control in each cDNA library. this is most evident when comparing the data for uninfected control shRNA-treated A549 cells with those for uninfected RNase L shRNA-treated A549 cells. these data alone do not define targets of RNase L. it is critical that % total cDNA reads be compared at individual sites in each RNA. 18S rRNA UU743 (1.35% of total cDNA reads) and UU541 (0.37% of total cDNA reads) are the two most frequent RNase L-dependent cleavage sites among all of the RNAs from IAVNS1-infected A549 cells. the IAV RNA sequence most frequently cleaved by RNase L was present in M positive-strand RNA. HA and NA RNAs exhibited little cleavage by RNase L or other endonucleases. poliovirus RNA was cleaved by RNase L and other metal ion-independent endoribonucleases. but only positive strand of poliovirus RNA was cleaved in infected cells. IAV RNAs were cleaved by RNase L and other metal ion-independent endoribonucleases in both negative and positive strands. PB2, PB1 and PA negative strands were among the most frequently cleaved IAV RNAs. this suggests that nucleocapsid does not protect IAV RNAs from cleavage within RNPs. we observed 5-fold-more cleavage at particular sites in rRNAs in IAVNS1-infected A549 cells than in uninfected cells. 18S rRNA UU743 and UU541 are the most frequent targets of RNase L among the host and viral RNAs. cyclic phosphate cDNA libraries should be able to reveal endoribonuclease cleavage sites in host and viral RNAs from tissues, including lung tissue from IAV-infected mice. future experiments can be used to examine the kinetics of host and viral RNA cleavage in IAV-infected cells. the antiviral activity and sequence specificity of RNase L can be considered in the design of novel codon-deoptimized IAV vaccines (52). we suspect that codon deoptimization can be used to increase the susceptibility of viral RNAs to endoribonucleases."}
