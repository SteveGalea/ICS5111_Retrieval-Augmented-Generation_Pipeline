{"summary": "Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses that carry single-stranded, bi-segmented, RNA genomes. the family Arenaviridae comprises a single genus (Arenavirus) that contains at least 25 members [2]\u2013[4]. the new world arenavirus cluster is subdivided into clades A, B, and C. clade B viruses are boxed in orange and boxed in cyan. pathogenic and nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses do not cluster independently on phylogenetic analysis. AMAV shares highest sequence similarity with GTOV. the natural reservoirs of SABV and Chapare virus have not been identified. AMAV was isolated from Neacomys spinosus (bristly mouse) and Neacomys guianea (guiana bristly mouse) and TCRV is suggested to have a non-rodent host, Artibeus species fruit bats in Trinidad and tobago [12], [17]\u2013[19]. molecule that has several properties favorable to arenaviral replication. it is rapidly endocytosed into acidic compartments, expressed on endothelial cells. it is upregulated on rapidly dividing cells including activated lymphocytes. it remains to be shown, however, if these nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses could use the TfR1 orthologs of their principal host animals. the entry of all four pseudoviruses was unaffected by the -HLA antibody. the -human TfR1 antibody inhibited infection by GTOV and MACV pseudoviruses. the entry of all four pseudoviruses was unaffected by the -HLA antibody. GTOV GP shares greater sequence similarity with AMAV GP. AMAV does not use human TfR1 as a cellular receptor. aliquots of same cells were infected with AMAV or TCRV pseudoviruses. the entry of LCMV pseudovirus was unaffected. AMAV and TCRV pseudoviruses can use animal orthologs of TfR1. we cloned the genes of their TfR1 orthologs by RT-PCR from frozen tissues of N. spinosus (NsTfR1) and A. jamaicensis (AjTfR1). in order to determine the ability of the AMAV and TCRV GP1 proteins to bind these TfR1 orthologs, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing human, Ns, or A HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human TfR1 (hTfR1), N. spinosus TfR1 (NsTfR1) or A. jamaicensis TfR1 (AjTfR1) cells were incubated 48 hr later with an -flag antibody or Ig-fusion proteins. the association of these proteins with cells was measured by flow cytometry. expression levels of the various TfR1 orthologs were normalized to that of human TfR1 (-flag, left panels) infection levels were normalized to that of mock-transfected cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing human TfR1, ZbTfR1, NsTfR1, AjTfR1, or vector alone. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human TfR1, AjTfR1 or NsTfR1. infection of TCRV was enhanced on cells expressing AjTfR1 and AMAV was only enhanced on cells expressing NsTfR1. four variants (ah2 through ah5) include residues from AjTfR1 and five variants (nh2, nh4, nh5, nh7 and nh8) include NsTfR1 sequence. variant (zh1) containing two alterations - R208G and V210 - was an efficient receptor for TCRV. modified mutations convert human TfR1 into an efficient receptor for AMAV and TCRV. the structure of the human TfR1 dimer is shown, oriented with the cell membrane at the bottom. the apical, protease-like, and helical domains are indicated in green, red, and yellow. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human, Zb, Aj, or NsTfR1 along with the zh variants (C), the ah variants (D), or the nh variants (E). in parallel, cells were infected with AMAV, TCRV, or VSV pseudoviruses. HEK293T cells were infected with GTOV, AMAV, TCRV, or MACV pseudoviruses expressing GFP in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of an -human TfR1 (BD Pharmingen) infection levels were assessed 48 hr later by measuring GFP expression by flow cytometry. aliquots of the same cells were infected with AMAV or TCRV pseudoviruses. infection by AMAV and TCRV pseudoviruses was significantly enhanced by the introduction of ZbTfR1 into CHO cells. aliquots of these cells were infected with AMAV, TCRV, or LCMV pseudoviruses. expression levels of various TfR1 were normalized to that of human TfR1 (-flag, top panels). infection levels were normalized to that of mock-transfected cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human TfR1 (hTfR1), N. spinosus TfR1 (NsTfR1) and A. jamaicensis TfR1 (AjTfR1) cells were incubated 48 hr later with an -flag antibody or Ig-fusion proteins. the association of these proteins with cells was measured by flow cytometry. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human, ZbTfR1, NsTfR1, AjTfR1 orthologs or vector alone. expression levels of the various TfR1 orthologs were normalized to that of human TfR1 (-flag, left panels) pathogenic NW arenaviruses efficiently enter HEK293T cells using endogenous human TfR1 [32] CHO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing human TfR1, AjTfR1, NsTfR1, or vector alone, and infected with MACV, JUNV, or GTOV pseudoviruses. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human TfR1, AjT a loop between strands 1 and 2 in the apical domain of human TfR1 is a likely interaction site for the GPs of the NW hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses [39],[44]. this loop includes tyrosine 211, which is essential for MACV, JUNV, and GTOV to use human TfR1 [39]. mutations at R208 and V210 were individually introduced into human TfR1. the variant containing V210G (ah4) supported TCRV pseudovirus entry efficiently. the variant containing R208G (ah3) was a less efficient receptor. nh5, which contains four mutations, were efficient receptors for AMAV. ence alignment of residues 195 through 216 of human TfR1 with analogous sequences of the TfR1 orthologs of Z. brevicauda (zh1 and zh2), A. jamaicensis (ah2 through ah5), and N. spinosus (nh2, nh4, nh5, nh7, and nh8) were generated based on this sequence alignment. a recent identified fifth hemorrhagic fever NW arenavirus, Chapare virus, remains to be characterized. closely related to these pathogenic viruses are three clade B arenaviruses that do not cause disease in humans. the GP sequences of these viruses are more similar to those of the pathogenic viruses than they are to each other. TCRV and AMAV pseudoviruses efficiently utilize the TfR1 orthologs of several species including those of their native hosts. it is therefore likely that TfR1 is also central to the replication of these nonpathogenic viruses in their native hosts. these nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses have been identified. this possibility has precedent in other emerging viruses. the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans requires as few as two amino acid substitutions in the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein. pathogenic clade B arenaviruses can use more than one receptor. clade B arenaviruses may also use an additional receptor. the cladogram was plotted using Drawtree [56],[57] cell lines were grown in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. both cell lines were grown in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. TfR1 genes for Neacomys spinosus and Artibeus jamaicensis were cloned from frozen heart and kidney, and liver tissues. RNA was isolated from these tissues using RNAqueous (Ambion) and cDNA was generated by SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) MACV (Carvallo strain), JUNV (MC2), and GTOV (INH-95551) were cloned into a previously described pcDM8-based plasmid containing the CD5 signal sequence and the Fc region of human IgG1. the sequence of AMAV GP is the same as BeAn 7063 strain (GenBank AF512834). HEK293T cells or CHO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing various TfR1 orthologs. at 48 hr post-transfection, cells were replated for flow cytometry and infection. HEK293 cells growing on gelatin-treated glass coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding AjTfR1, NsTfR1 or human TfR1. at 12 hr post-infection, the cells were washed, fixed with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with mouse hyperimmune sera specific for NW arenaviruses. both cell lines were grown in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. plasmids expressing the TfR1 orthologs of F. domesticus and C. musculinus were provided by Colin Parrish.
