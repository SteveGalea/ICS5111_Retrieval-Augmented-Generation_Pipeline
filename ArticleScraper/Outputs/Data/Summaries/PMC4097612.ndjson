{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite. it is characterized by proliferation of tachyzoites in a variety of cells throughout the body. the parasite establishes a chronic infection by forming tissue cysts, primarily in the brain. resistance to chronic infection with type II T. gondii is under genetic control in mice. strains with the H-2b or H-2k haplotype are susceptible and develop progressive and ultimately fatal TE without immunosuppressive treatment (18, 19) strains with the H-2d haplotype are resistant and establish a latent, chronic infection (18, 19) thelial adhesion and activation molecules are found in injured brain but not in normal brain (24). we used the SCID and nude mouse model of reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection and analyzed vascular endothelial adhesion molecules. BALB/c, SCID, and nude mice were infected with 10 cysts orally by gavage (20) sulfadiazine-supplemented drinking water (400 mg/liter) began 7 or 8 days after infection for 3 to 4 weeks to control proliferation of tachyzoites and establish a chronic infection in their brains (20, 21). the sections were sequentially incubated with rat primary antibody, biotin-conjugated anti-rat IgG, or anti-rat IgG, or anti-rat IgM; peroxidase-streptavidin; diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide; and methylene blue or hematoxylin counterstain. the slides were examined by light microscopy. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated MAb to 1 integrin (clone Ha2/5) and PE-Cy5-conjugated MAb to CD44 (clone IM7) were used as negative controls. at least 20,000 cells were analyzed using cellQuest software. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued 3 days after cell transfer. brains of infected nude mice were snap-frozen in OCT compound. sections were stained with anti-CD3 (17A2; BioLegend) or isotype control. three sections, at least 50 m apart, were stained in each brain. a photo of each of the foci containing PV was taken at a high magnification. Flow cytometry to detect T cells that migrated into the brains of infected nude mice. total RNAs were purified from brains of SCID and nude mice using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) mRNA levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-, and BAG1 were also measured with the following primers and probes. the IFN- probe was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032 end and TAMRA at the 3\u2032 end. all the other probes were labeled with FAM at the 5\u2032 end and minor groove binder (MGB)-nonfluorescent quencher (NFQ) at the 3\u2032 ends. an aliquot of the brain suspension was examined microscopically for the number of cysts. the brain suspension was examined microscopically for the number of cysts. SCID and nude mice were infected with 10 cysts orally by gavage. the sections were sequentially incubated with rat primary antibody, biotin-conjugated anti-rat IgG, or anti-rat IgG; peroxidase-streptavidin; diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide; and irrelevant negative-control antigens. slides were examined by light microscopy. FITC-hamster IgM() (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was purchased from BD Biosciences. at least 20,000 cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur. the cells (0.9 107 to 1.5 107) were transferred into infected and sulfadiazine-treated SCID or nude mice at 4 weeks after infection. the animals received the MAb (200 or 250 g in 0.2 ml PBS) intraperitoneally every other day. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued 3 days after the cell transfer. the sections were sequentially incubated with rabbit anti-T. gondii primary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, peroxidase-rabbit anti-peroxidase complex, diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide, and hematoxylin counterstain. a photograph of each of the foci containing large numbers of PV was taken at a high magnification. mRNA levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-, NOS2, VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, tachyzoite-specific SAG1 and bradyzoite-specific BAG1 were also measured. real-time PCR was conducted in triplicate to measure the amounts of mRNA for tachyzoites in the mouse brains. TGAAAGCCTAGAAAGTCTGAATAA (forward), TGGCTCTGCAGGATTTTCATG (reverse), and TCACCATCCTTTTGCCAGTTCCTCCAG (probe) the IFN- probe was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032 end and TAMRA at the 3\u2032 end. all other probes were labeled with FAM at the 5\u2032 end and minor groove binder (MGB) the two strains of mice were infected and the SCID mice received treatment with sulfadiazine from 7 days after infection. we stained frozen sections of brains from SCID and wild-type mice with antibodies against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, MAdCAM-1, and PNAd 25 days after infection. the number of cerebral vessels expressed VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 was determined by frozen-section immunohistochemistry staining. the arrows indicate representative VCAM-1+ and ICAM-1+ vessels. the error bars indicate standard errors. our results in T. gondii infection are different from those observed in mice with experimental allergic encephalitis and a model of Alzheimer's disease. we previously showed that IFN- plays an important role in recruiting immune T cells into the brains of infected BALB/c mice. endothelial VCAM-1, but not ICAM-1, in their brains is dependent on IFN- (33) infected, sulfadiazine-treated SCID mice received systemic transfer of immune T cells purified from the spleens of chronically infected BALB/c mice. anti-4 integrin MAb is known to block 41 integrin/VCAM-1 and 47 integrin/MAdCAM-1 binding. however, any inhibitory effect of the MAb in this mouse model would be on 41/VCAM-1 binding. cerebral vessels expressing MAdCAM-1 were not detected in these animals. these results indicate that the inhibitory effect of anti-4 integrin MAb on T cell recruitment into the brain in this mouse model is on 41/VCAM-1 binding. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued to initiate reactivation of the infection in the brain (20, 22, 23) mRNA levels were detected before and after initiation of reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection. these results strongly suggested that VCAM-1/41 integrin interaction is crucial for mediating infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells into the brain parenchyma during the early stage of reactivation of cerebral infection with T. gondii. mRNA levels for CD3, CD4, and CD8 were 3.0, 2.6, and 3.9 times less, respectively, in the brains of nude mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb. nude mice were infected with 10 cysts of the ME49 strain orally and treated with sulfadiazine for 3 weeks beginning 7 days after infection. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued 3 days after the cell transfer. mRNA levels for the T cell markers and numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brains were determined by real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry. the binding of lymphocyte 41 integrin to endothelial VCAM-1 on cerebral vessels plays a crucial role in recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells into the brains of chronically infected mice. both CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells that infiltrated into the brains of chronically infected mice are a CD44high LFA-1high CD62Lneg effector/memory T cell population. BALB/c mice were infected with 10 cysts of the ME49 strain orally. their spleen cells were obtained during the chronic stage of infection for analysis of expression of CD44, 4 integrin, and 1 integrin on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. mRNA expression of IFN- and NOS2 detected in the brains of SCID mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb. mRNA levels for both IFN- and NOS2 in mice that had not received T cells were very low or close to detectable limits. the majority of IFN- and NOS2 expressed in the brains of animals with the T cell transfer were from or induced by T cells that had migrated into their brains. there were no significant differences in their amounts between the experimental groups. IFN- and NOS2 mRNAs in the brains of anti-4 integrin MAb-treated mice were 2.8 and 3.8 times less in the brains of the former. levels of IFN- and NOS2 mRNAs in the brains of the former were as low as those detected in the brains of control nude mice that had not received T cells. these differences could be due to the presence of low numbers of thymus-independent T cells only in the former animals the amounts of SAG1 mRNA detected in the brains of nude mice were 17 times greater than those detected in the brains of animals that had received the T cells with control MAb. these results indicate that T cell recruitment mediated by binding of lymphocyte 41 integrin to endothelial VCAM-1 is critical for preventing tachyzoite growth. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued 3 days after the cell transfer. mRNA levels for SAG1 and BAG1 and numbers of tachyzoite-associated foci and PV were determined 6 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine treatment. mRNA ratios in the brains of nude mice that had received immune T cells with treatment with control MAb were markedly (7.5 times) less than those of the control animals without the T cell transfer. results support the importance of T cell recruitment mediated by binding of lymphocyte 41 integrin to endothelial VCAM-1 for preventing reactivation of chronic T. gondii infection. most of the foci associated with tachyzoites in the animals treated with control MAb contained only small numbers of tachyzoites. such inflammatory foci in these animals were often associated with necrosis of brain tissue. such inflammatory foci in these animals were often associated with necrosis of brain tissue. fewer T cells are associated with each of these foci to prevent tachyzoite growth in the brains of mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb. differences in mRNAs for the T cell markers between these two groups were less than those observed at 3 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine treatment. the amounts of mRNA for IFN- and NOS2 were 40% and 56% greater in the brains of nude mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb than in those treated with control MAb at the later stage of reactivation of T. gondii infection. the ability of innate immune cells to express upregulated IFN- and NOS2 in response to increased numbers of tachyzoites is evident from the evidence of the presence of large amounts of mRNA for these molecules chyzoite-specific SAG1 mRNA were present in their brains. mRNA levels for IFN- and NOS2 were measured by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA levels for IFN- and NOS2 were measured by real-time RT-PCR. -1 are the vascular endothelial adhesion molecules expressed on cerebral vessels in SCID and wild-type mice with chronic infection with T. gondii. the two strains of mice were infected and the SCID mice received treatment with sulfadiazine from 7 days after infection to control the proliferation of tachyzoites. SCID and wild-type BALB/c mice were infected with 10 cysts orally. one group of BALB/c mice also received sulfadiazine beginning 14 days after infection. all the mice were sacrificed 25 days after infection. using infected, sulfadiazine-treated SCID mice and a transfer of immune T cells is suitable to examine the roles of the cerebrovascular endothelial adhesion molecules in T cell recruitment into the brain. we previously showed that IFN- plays an important role in recruiting immune T cells into the brains of infected BALB/c mice. infected, sulfadiazine-treated SCID mice received systemic transfer of immune T cells purified from the spleens of chronically infected BALB/c mice. anti-4 integrin MAb is known to block 41 integrin/VCAM-1 and 47 integrin/MAdCAM-1 binding (37, 38), but any inhibitory effect of the MAb in this mouse model would be on 41/VCAM-1 binding. mice were approximately 280 times lower than those for VCAM-1 in these animals. the infection did not stimulate expression of MAdCAM-1 mRNA in their brains. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued to initiate reactivation. mRNA levels for VCAM-1 were detected before and after reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection. mRNA levels for the T cell markers were measured by real-time RT. mRNA levels for the T cell markers were measured by real-time RT. mRNA levels for CD3, CD4, and CD8 were 3.0, 2.6, and 3.9 times less, respectively, in the brains of nude mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb than in the brains of animals treated with control MAb. mRNA levels for CD3, CD4, and CD8+ T cells are markedly lower during the early stage of reactivation of T. gondii infection. groups received immune T cells (0.9 107 cells) pretreated with either anti-4 integrin or a control MAb intravenously 4 weeks after infection. thereafter, the mice received the MAb (200 or 250 g) intraperitoneally every other day. error bars indicate standard errors. the binding of lymphocyte 41 integrin to endothelial VCAM-1 on cerebral vessels plays a crucial role in recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells into the brains of mice chronically infected with T. gondii. a majority (71 to 79%) of the CD44high populations of both CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells were positive for 41 integrin. many T cells in the CD44low population were also detected as 41 integrin+. only low percentages of these T cells expressed high levels of the adhesion molecule. BALB/c mice were chronically infected with 10 cysts of the ME49 strain orally. anti-4 integrin MAb were 5.7 and 9.2 times less than those in the brains of animals treated with control MAb. mRNA levels for both IFN- and NOS2 were very low or close to detectable limits in most of the mice at this early stage of reactivation of infection. there were no significant differences in their amounts between the experimental groups. mRNAs for IFN- and NOS2 were 2.8 and 3.8 times less in the brains of anti-4 integrin or control MAb-treated mice. levels of IFN- and NOS2 mRNAs in the brains of the former were as low as those detected in the brains of control nude mice that had not received T cells. the amounts of SAG1 mRNA detected in the brains of nude mice were 17 times greater than those detected in the brains of animals that did not receive T cells. these results indicate that T cell recruitment mediated by binding of lymphocyte 41 integrin to endothelial VCAM-1 is critical for preventing tachyzoite growth. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued 3 days after cell transfer. mRNA levels for tachyzoite-associated foci and PV were determined 6 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine. specific BAG1 mRNA ratios in the brains of nude mice were markedly (7.5 times) less than those of the control animals without the T cell transfer. the mRNA ratios in the brains of mice that had received immune T cells with treatment with control MAb were equivalent to those of the control animals without the T cell transfer. most of the foci associated with tachyzoites in the animals treated with control MAb contained only small numbers of tachyzoites. the numbers of parasitophorous vacuoles containing tachyzoites detected in the brain sections were 20 times fewer in the brains of mice treated with control MAb than in those treated with anti-4 integrin MAb. fewer inflammatory foci associated with tachyzoites in mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb than in those treated with control MAb. differences in mRNAs for the T cell markers between these two groups were less than those observed at 3 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine treatment. the amounts of mRNA for IFN- and NOS2 were 40% and 56% greater in the brains of nude mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb than in those treated with control MAb at the later stage of reactivation of T. gondii infection. the ability of innate immune cells to express upregulated IFN- and NOS2 in response to increased numbers of tachyzoites is evident from the evidence of the presence of large amounts of mRNA for these molecules large numbers of foci associated with tachyzoites and large amounts of tachyzoite-specific SAG1 mRNA were present in their brains. induction of increased expression of IFN- and NOS2 after large numbers of tachyzoites had already grown is not effective in controlling the parasite in the brain. it appears that prompt recruitment of immune T cells mediated by VCAM-1/41 integrin interaction is crucial for preventing proliferation of ta infected sulfadiazine-treated SCID and nude mice received systemic transfer of immune T cells. reactivation of cerebral infection was initiated by discontinuation of sulfadiazine treatment (20, 22, 23). NK cells are able to produce this cytokine in response to T. gondii. Flow cytometric analyses showed that the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells that had migrated into the brain were significantly lower in nude mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb than in animals treated with control MAb. integrin interaction is crucial for recruitment of both CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells into the brain during early stage of reactivation of infection with T. gondii. in vitro studies showed that IFN- activates microglia to prevent tachyzoite growth. antimicrobial activity of the murine microglia is mediated by production of nitric oxide by NOS2 (42) the presence of large amounts of mRNA for tachyzoite-specific SAG1 was associated with high SAG1/BAG1 mRNA ratios. this is consistent with the presence of markedly greater numbers of foci associated with tachyzoites and parasitophorous vacuoles containing tachyzoites in the sections of the brains of mice treated with anti-4 integrin MAb. rapid recruitment of immune T cells mediated by VCAM-1/41 integrin interaction into the brain and prompt induction of cerebral expression of IFN- and NOS2 during the early stage of reactivation of chronic T. gondii infection. the importance of T cell recruitment mediated by VCAM-1/41 integrin interaction has not been reported before. neonatal inactivation of VCAM-1 resulted in expression of a molecule that is not usually expressed in wild-type mice to compensate for the absence of VCAM-1. it is also possible that adhesion molecules expressed on the OT-1 CD8+ T cells activated with OVA in vitro are limited to 41 integrin. the anti-4 integrin MAb is intended to treat multiple sclerosis or Crohn's disease. it causes reactivation of T. gondii infection in the brains of patients."}
