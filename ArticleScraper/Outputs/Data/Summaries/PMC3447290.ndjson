{"summary": "2009 influenza pandemic involved the new strain of H1N1 virus. the pandemic started in. April 2009 in Mexico and spread worldwide. the time interval between sampling and onset of symptoms was defined as 72 hours. each primary health care provider was responsible to collect specimens 2 times a week from all the patients seeking for medical assistance that day. the laboratory investigations were performed by PCR analysis. 2009-2010 2010-2011 A (H1) (N, %) A (H1) (N, %) B Age group (years) Total cases Lethal cases Total cases Lethal cases 0\u20134 210 (16.3) 0 (0) 150 (24.2) 1 (3.4) 187 (32.0) 0 (0) 5\u201314 410 (31.8) 1 (3) 91 (14.7) 1 (3.4) 139 (23.8) 0 (0) 15\u201329 404 (31.4) 13 (39) 189 (3 at least one underlying medical condition was reported in 70.7% of deaths related to pandemic influenza strain and 96% of deaths related to influenza type B. 19% of patients with influenza type A and 68% of patients with influenza type B had coronary heart disease. the majority of registered cases were within the age groups of 5\u201314 and 15\u201329. the predominating virus was still H1N1 with 48.5% typed as influenza B. only one influenza case was related to H3N2. the mean age of patients with influenza-associated deaths was 46.7 for type A influenza virus and 62.4 for type B virus (P = 0.012) the absolute number of deaths due to influenza A was highest in the age group of 30\u201364 years. for influenza type B absolute number of deaths as well as case fatality ratio was highest in the age group of 65 and older. the majority of lethal cases occurred among patients with underlying medical conditions (only 21.7% of death among previously healthy people) the majority of lethal cases occurred among patients with underlying medical condition (only 21.7% of death among previously healthy people) no systematic approach is used to vaccinate high risk groups and health care workers. in all fatal cases the institution of antiviral therapy was delayed beyond the 48 hour threshold, possibly contributing to the grim outcome."}
