{"summary": "nucleic acid aptamers are RNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA oligonucleotides with lengths typically ranging from 15 to 70 mers. nucleic acid aptamers have many advantages in their suitability for clinical application and industrialization. the global aptamer market was estimated to be valued at $107.56 million in 2015 and to reach $244.93 million by 2020. RNA aptamers are chemically unstable because of the presence of a reactive hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) at the 2\u2032 position of the ribose sugar in RNA nucleotides. this \u2013OH group easily gets deprotonated in solution, especially in alkaline solutions. resulting anionic 2\u2032-O may nucleophilically attack the phosphodiester linkage, leading to the hydrolysis of RNA molecules. the selection of RNA aptamers requires reverse transcription and in vitro transcription in every round of selection, as well as an initial transcription for generating the RNA library from a DNA library. once selected, the cost of producing DNA aptamers is lower than that for RNA aptamers. cell-SELEX is able to generate DNA aptamers that recognize the cell-surface or intracellular target protein in their native conformation. this method first selects the specific aptamers that bind to the target cells by a positive selection step. then eliminates the non-target cell-specific aptamers by a negative selection step. cells and metastatic cells are stimulus-response cell-SELEX [29] and metastatic-cell-based SELEX [30]. a two-step stimulus-response cell-SELEX method has been developed. using asymmetric PCR or streptavidin-biotin magnetic separation for the generation of single-stranded DNA to reduce the selection cycle to two steps. the selected sequences are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. the selected aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. amer selection (MARAS) is a method that uses magnetic beads and an externally applied rotating magnetic field to separate target-bound DNA oligonucleotides from a library. it abandons the multi-cycle evolutionary process used in conventional SELEX and thus can achieve rapid selection. a one-step selection approach is another promising way to increase the rate of aptamer generation. use of a chemically modified nucleic acid library directly as it requires only one PCR step. a DNA microarray has been used to achieve one-step aptamer identification. the sequences of interest can be produced on the arrays for selection and cloning. most DNA aptamers have a small molecular weight (ranging from 5\u201315 kDa) aptamers are readily removed via renal filtration and metabolic processes, limiting their therapeutic application. aptamers are commonly used to prolong their circulation in the bloodstream. genetically modified cell-SELEX methods have been developed to select aptamers targeting specific cells. they are stimulus-response cell-SELEX [29] and metastatic cell-based SELEX [30]. aptamers with the strongest affinity for the target molecules are obtained. competitive cell-SELEX uses a nitrocellulose membrane that contains target cells and negative control cells to select target aptamers. this method can reduce the selection time, since the negative selection step is not required. novel methods for rapid selection of highly specific DNA aptamers have been developed. aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. rapid one-step selection method was developed to select specific DNA aptamers using only one PCR step. this method allows the use of a chemically modified nucleic acid library directly as it requires only one PCR step. aptamers by nuclease are well known to be more stable than RNA aptamers. degradation of DNA aptamers by nuclease is still a serious problem. one of the effective solutions is to use a library with chemically modified DNA sequences in the screening process. cell-SELEX is able to generate DNA aptamers that recognize the cell-surface or intracellular target protein in their native conformation. this method first selects the specific aptamers that bind to the target cells by a positive selection step, then eliminates the non-target cell-specific aptamers by a negative selection step using non-target cells. aptamers are stimulus-response cell-SELEX [29] and metastatic-cell-based S ponse cell-SELEX method uses asymmetric PCR or streptavidin-biotin magnetic separation for the generation of single-stranded DNA. this method reduces the selection time, since the negative selection step is not required. the selected sequences are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. novel methods for rapid selection of highly specific DNA aptamers have been developed. aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual. aptamers are amplified, cloned and eluted by heating in water. this method uses biofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles to separate target-bound DNA oligonucleotides from a library. this method was developed to select specific DNA aptamers using only one PCR step. this method was described as a user-friendly, low-cost and easy way to select DNA aptamers. strategies to overcome rapid degradation of DNA Aptamers by nuclease are well known to be more stable than RNA aptamers. the degradation of DNA aptamers by nuclease is still a serious problem. one of the effective solutions is to use a library with chemically modified DNA sequences. DNA aptamers are readily removed via renal filtration and metabolic processes, limiting their therapeutic application. conjugation of DNA aptamers with other nanomaterials has been successfully used to improve the lifetime of DNA aptamers. some DNA aptamers selected for this purpose in Table 1. sensitivity and specificity have a great impact on their potential for clinical use. aptamers are used to diagnose human diseases. [59] LXL-1 Metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) 45 44.0 Direct binding (Cy5 labeled) 76% (n = 34) 100% ( n = 8 cancer cell lines) [61] 32 Glioblastoma multiforme cells (U87) epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) 30 0.62 Direct binding (FITC labeled) ns. ns. 87.5% (n = 8 cancer aptamers can be selected for developing diagnostic tools for various diseases, as long as definite targets, such as disease-specific biomarkers or pathogens, are available. many reported DNA aptamers are selected with cancer cells aiming to diagnose and image cancer tissue. several DNA aptamers have been selected with metastatic cancer cells and negatively selected with non-metastatic cancer cells. the resulting aptamer (XL-33) was found to possess specific affinity to the metastatic colon cancer cells (Kd = 0.7 nM) the biomarker molecules express or overexpress on the cancer cells were also used for the selection of diagnostic DNA aptamers. DNA aptamers have been selected predominantly with cell-SELEX and magnetic beads-based methods by targeting various viruses and bacteria or their antigen protein [6] because of the low cost and short production time of DNA aptamers. the aptamer based diagnostic tools hold particular advantages for the diagnosis of infections that need point-of-care testing. the DNA aptamer with the lowest Kd value (4.93 nM) was subjected to the development of different biosensors for the detection of myoglobin. l-Homocysteine is an amino acid intermediate, whose elevated level in the blood is associated with coronary heart disease. it is the most frequently used DNA aptamer for the demonstration of the proof-of-principle of various detection methods. it can be roughly classified into four types based on the way the signal is generated. the aptamers for cancer cells imaging usually use this mode. this mode is suited for the development of aptamer-based reporters for real-time sensing applications. but the limitation of this mode is the decreased aptamer binding affinity because of competition from the QDNA. in the sandwich-like mode, the target is \u201cthe meat\u201d inserted within \u201ctwo pieces of bread\u201d consisting of an aptamer. aptamer is a partial duplex with a small oligonucleotide modified with a quenching moiety. when the target is introduced, the aptamer prefers to form the aptamer-target complex. the binding of the target to the aptamer will change the structure of the aptamers. aptamer targets the hydrophilic surface protein (HSP) of leishmania promastigote. reporter beads with aptamer-captured reporters were added. aptamer-captured reporters were collected on the magnetic rack. aptamer-based diagnostic tools for human diseases are still in the lab. the DNA aptamer XQ-2d targets the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) cells. it has been tested with clinical PDAC tissue sections and in vivo imaging of PDAC tumor-bearing mice. two out of eight normal pancreatic tissues were detected by the Cy5-labeled XQ-2d. many reported DNA aptamers are selected with cancer cells. these cancer cells include pancreatic [54], colon [30], liver [55,56], cholangio [57], gastric [58,59], prostate [27], breast [60] and glioblastoma [61] cancer cells. selection consists of positive selection with cancer cells and negative selection with normal cells from the same organ. DNA aptamers have been selected predominantly with cell-SELEX and magnetic beads-based methods. the aptamers may not recognize the natural biomarkers on the surface of cancer cells because of the difference in the 3D structure of the purified biomarkers and the natural biomarkers. the selected aptamer showed high affinity (Kd = 4.6 nM) and specificity to the H5N1 virus. markers in the blood, such as myoglobin, C-reactive protein, l-homocysteine and thrombin have been used to select DNA aptamer for the diagnosis of related diseases. the first reported DNA aptamer is the thrombin aptamer. it is the most frequently used DNA aptamer for the demonstration of the proof-of-principle of various detection methods. the aptamers for cancer cells imaging usually use this mode. fluorophore-labeled DNA aptamer forms a partial duplex with a small oligonucleotide modified with a quenching moiety. when the target is introduced, the aptamer prefers to form the aptamer-target complex. the binding of the target to the aptamer will change the structure of the aptamers and release the partially complementary quencher. various detection methods have been applied by DNA aptamer based biosensors. this includes electrochemical, chemiluminescence, fluorescence, colorimetric, quantum dots-based and mass-sensitive detections. most of the DNA aptamers use fluorophore-labeled aptamers to recognize the cancer cells directly. the sandwich-like mode is frequently used for imaging of microorganisms. DNA aptamer XQ-2d targets the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) cells. it targets the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) cells and two out of eight normal pancreatic tissues were detected by the Cy5-labeled XQ-2d. the 2\u2032-O-methyl modified XQ-2d could last for 36 h in 10% FBS medium, but the unmodified XQ-2d was completely degraded after 24-h incubation. DNA Aptamers as therapeutic agents can inhibit protein-protein interactions by specifically binding to the target protein and thereby functioning as antagonists. aptamers can recognize a wide range of targets including small molecules, proteins and cells. ated Disease AS1411 Antisoma G-rich DNA aptamer Nucleolin Phase 2 (completed) Renal cell carcinoma [93] and acute myeloid leukemia [94,98] ARC1779 Achemix PEGylated DNA aptamer von Willebrand factor Phase 2 (completed) Thromboembolism [95], congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [96] and von Willebrand disease [99] NU ARC1779 blocks the binding between von Willebrand factor and the platelet. a phase 2 clinical trial for treating von Willebrand factor related platelet function disorders has been completed. a phase 2 clinical trial for treating von Willebrand factor related platelet function disorders has been completed. DNA aptamer NAS-24 was found to bind to vimentin and then cause apoptosis of mouse ascites adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. aptamers targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB-2/HER2) were shown to retard the tumorigenic growth of gastric cancer in mice with more effective activity than anti-ErbB-2/HER2 monoclonal antibody. amers have been selected to efficiently deliver chemotherapy drugs in vitro or in vivo. DNA aptamers were directly linked to the small oligonucleotides to form a DNA aptamer-oligonucleotide chimera. an anti-mucin 1 DNA aptamer covalently linked to miRNA-29b delivered miRNA-29b into ovarian cancer cells specifically and induce significant apoptosis of the cancer cells. 1411 aptamer conjugated PLGA nanoparticles have been developed to facilitate antiglioma delivery of paclitaxel in vivo. this aptamer-PEG-PLGA delivery system can prolong circulation time and enhance target accumulation of paclitaxel. other nanomaterials such as silica, carbon nanotubes and quantum dots have also been used in DNA aptamer\u2013nanoparticles delivery systems. guanine-rich aptamer AS1411 (Antisoma) is a guanine-rich aptamer with a guanine quadruplex structure, targeting nucleolin. nucleolin is a eukaryotic nucleolar phosphoprotein that is involved in the synthesis and maturation of ribosomes. NU172 (ARCA biopharma) is an unmodified DNA aptamer targeting thrombin. it can prolong blood clotting in patients with congenital thrombocytopenic purpura. the phase 2 clinical trial using NU172 as anticoagulation agent has been completed. DNA aptamers are used in two ways for targeted delivery of drugs. the ability of aptamers to specifically recognize the target makes it a potential targeted delivery tool. many DNA aptamers have been selected to efficiently deliver chemotherapy drugs in vivo or in vivo. a DNA aptamer-siRNA chimera could specifically enter into CD4 (+) T cells. an anti-mucin 1 DNA aptamer covalently linked to miRNA-29b was found to deliver miRNA-29b into ovarian cancer cells specifically. a number of nanomaterials have been explored to conjugate with DNA aptamers to form the delivery platform. DNA aptamers have great potential to be used as an alternative to antibodies. aptamers are expected to achieve a similar success to antibodies. the high cost of chemically modified RNA might limit their study."}
