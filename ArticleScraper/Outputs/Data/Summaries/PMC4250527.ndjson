{"summary": "infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) appears under different forms of evolution, ranging from the asymptomatic and self-limited infection to the chronic state. a number of studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of cytokines have a correlation with the outcomes of HBV infection[3],[4]. however, controversies exist among similar studies. ER rs2077647 T/C genotype (previous reported c.30T > C, exon 1) had an influence on susceptibility to persistent HBV infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. previous studies reported an association of ER polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection. the results were supplemented with manual searches of references of final published articles. review articles, editorials or conference abstracts were excluded. core antibody (anti-HBc) were positive were defined as self-limiting infection controls. patients who had been positive for HBsAg or HBV DNA for at least 6 months were included as persistent HBV infection cases. study provided sufficient data for examining an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); patients recruited in the studies had not received prior HBV-related treatment. we also carried out stratified analyses by ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) and sources (hospital-based and population-based) sensitivity analysis was performed to assess statistical heterogeneity. a(x/y/z) represents the number of studies of IFN- rs2430561T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER rs2077647 T/C respectively. inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with no detectable HBV infection were defined as healthy controls. each publication, including name of the first author, year of publication, country/region of the first or corresponding author, ethnicity, number of cases and controls, genotyping methods, and polymorphisms of IFN- rs2430561, IL28B rs12979860 or ER rs2077647. a request was sent to corresponding author for additional data. rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER rs2077647 T/C SNPs were found in our search. countries in which these studies were carried out include china, south Korea, Brazil, Iran, Spain, United States, Italy and Romania. eighteen studies were on Asians, 5 on Caucasians and 1 on Brazilians.

IFN- rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER rs2077647 T/C SNPs were associated with reduced persistent HBV infection risk. the results of TT vs. CC and CC vs. CT+TT implied that ER rs2077647 CC might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence. the study of Shi had to be excluded because it contained no individuals carrying IL28B rs12979860. it contained no individuals carrying IL28B rs12979860. iFN rs2430561, IL28B rs12979860 and ER rs2077676 were no healthy controls in the study of Ren S[13]. the results were still stable.

IFN- rs2430561T/A is a SNP located in the first intron of the IFN- gene. it has been demonstrated that possession of rs2430561T and A alleles should be associated with high and low IFN- expression, respectively[7],[25]. rs12979860 may alter the immune responses against HCV but not HBV. this could be explained by the characteristics of IL28B. IL28B plays a more important role in the infection of HCV than that of HBV. the risk of persistent HBV infection was reduced to 0.289 (95% CI, [0.187, 0.446]; P 0.001). however, ER rs2077647 T/C is a synonymous polymorphism located in exon 1, and Zhai et al. investigated that such effect could be caused by some other functional polymorphisms. lager and well-designed multicenter studies should be performed to re-evaluate the associations. the countries in which these studies were carried out include china, south Korea, Brazil, Brazil, Iran, Spain, Italy and Romania. eighteen studies were on Asians, 5 on Caucasians and 1 on Brazilians. a Gao QJ[10] 2009/China Asian Population-based IFN- rs2430561 TT/TA/AAT vs A 7/53/1467 vs 81 - 9/35/2553 vs 85 0.00 Cheong JY[12] 2006/South Korea Asian Hospital-based IFN- rs2430561 TT/TA/AAT vs A - 3/47/15153 vs 347 5/94/314104 2006/China Asian Hospital-based IL28B rs12979860 CC/CT/TTC vs T - 22/21/665 vs 33 29/17/375 vs 23 0.78 Martin MP[15] 2010/United States Caucasian Population-based IL28B rs12979860 CC/CT/TTC vs T 19/0/038 vs 0 - 114/23/0251 vs 23 CT+TT - 206/20 574/77 >0.05b Li WY[28] 2011/China Asian Hospital-based IL28B rs12979860 CC/CT+TT 179/24 180/23 178/25 >0.05b Lee DH[41] 2013/Korea Asian Hospital-based IL28B rs12979860 C vs T 381 vs 23 973 vs 62 - >0.05b Deng GH[ s 75 - 4/7/115 vs 9 0.16 a HWE was calculated by the merged data of healthy controls and self-limiting controls. b P value for HWE was extracted from original publication. relationship between IL28B rs12979860 C/T and persistent HBV infection risk was observed in all comparison models. quantitative data synthesis of individual polymorphisms, persistent hepatitis B virus infection cases versus healthy controls. study of Shi [32] had to be excluded because it contained no individuals carrying IL28B rs12979860 TT genotype. b P for Egger's test could not be evaluated since there was no healthy controls carrying IL28B rs12979860 TT genotype in the study of Ren S[13].

ER rs2077647 CC genotype may play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence, since the risk of persistent HBV infection was reduced to 0.289 (95% CI, [0.187, 0.446]; P 0.001). however, ER rs2077647 T/C is a synonymous polymorphism located in exon 1. meta-analysis suggests that IFN- rs2430561 T/A and ER rs2077647 T/C genetic polymorphisms were associated with the outcomes of HBV infection. but association between IL28B rs12979860 and HBV infection was not found."}
