{"summary": "introduction tea, produced from the dried leaves of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages consumed worldwide. studies have confirmed the critical health effects of tea due to its ample bioactive small-molecular components. tea bioactive compounds (TBCs) have been found to possess multifarious beneficial effects. previous studies mostly used low-throughput technologies to identify target gene(s) of certain TBCs. however, a complete interacting profile between TBCs and their target genes is lacking. this limits the scope of their application in dissection of tea healthy function. compound type, target gene(s) of TBC, gene symbol, gene ID, ENSEMBL ID, PDB ID, TBC bioactivity and the reference were provided. despite the fundamental browse, search, and download functions, we also deployed several useful applications in this database for users. the server PharmMapper can help to find the optimal mapping poses of the user-uploaded small molecules against all the target genes in PharmTargetDB. targets with a Fit Score value higher than 4.000 were selected as potential targets to ensure the high-confidence of TBC-target interactions. ation of TBCs and Target Genes Related information was manually collected for individual TBCs and their target genes. detailed meta-information about each TBC-target interacting entry, such as TBC, CAS number, PubChem CID, source of compound (e.g., green, black), compound type, target gene(s) of TBC. a small molecule as query in its background database is a large-scale pharmacophore repertoire curated from target information in TargetBank (in-house data in PharmMapper project), DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008), BindingDB (Liu et al., 2007), and PDTD (Gao et al., 2008). the server PharmMapper can help to find the optimal mapping poses of the user-uploaded small molecules against all information Annotation of TBCs and Target Genes Related information was manually collected for individual TBCs and their target genes. detailed meta-information about each TBC-target interacting entry, such as TBC, CAS number, PubChem CID, source of compound, compound type, target gene(s) of TBC, gene symbol, gene ID, ENSEMBL ID, PDB ID, TBC bioactivity confidence and the reference were made available in the TBC2target database. BLAST We achieved the BLAST function in TBC2target for sequence similarity alignment. users can upload their sequences to conduct BLAST search against target genes archived in TBC2target. the bioactive confidence was manually curated from the original articles. among the total 240 TBCs, 101, 39, 11, 39 and 12 are specific in green, black, dark, oolong and white teas. only 5 (2.1%) are shared by all five tea types, indicating a clear chemical profile of tea related to manufacturing process and tea fermentation extent. 39 TBCs (16.25%) target no more than three genes and 201 (83.75%) TBCs demonstrate targeting four or more genes. no more than three TBC interactions were documented for 342 genes, 176 of which are targeted by only one. bipartite network visualization of the interaction relationship for the chemical type flavan-3-ols. in the network, blue circles correspond to TBCs and target genes. a edge was placed between TBCs and target genes indicating TBC involvement in the regulation of the corresponding gene. -target associations and related annotation information were organized in a publicly available MySQL database4 as the back end. 19 data fields (e.g., CAS number, gene symbol) for each TBC-target interacting entry were presented and can be viewed in three main aspects as: (1) TBC information, (2) target gene information and (3) TBC bioactivity information. users can upload sequences to conduct BLAST search against target genes archived in TBC2target. record results will be displayed containing list of target genes with similarity to the query sequence, as well as gene accession, e-value, score, and useful link(s) to the corresponding gene page. total of 6,226 TBC-target interacting entries between 240 TBCs and 673 target genes were documented in TBC2target. the bioactive confidence was manually curated from the original articles. among the total 240 TBCs, 101, 39, 11, 39 and 12 (total 84.2%) are specific in green, black, dark, oolong and white teas. tea type # of chemicals (specific) Chemical types involved # of reference Green 133 (101) 19 55 Black 67 (39) 9 31 Dark 24 (11) 9 18 Oolong 55 (39) 8 17 White 25 (12) 5 17 Number of specific TBCs in the corresponding tea type. 39 TBCs (16.25%) target no more than three genes, with an average of 26 targeted genes. bipartite network describes 1,894 interactions between 95 flavan-3-ols TBCs and 156 target genes. 88, 75, 62, 61, and 51 target genes demonstrate the highest connectivity (degree) by interacting with 88, 75, 62, 61, and 51 target genes. bipartite network visualization of the TBC-target interaction relationship for the chemical type flavan-3-ols. a edge was placed between TBCs and target genes indicating TBC involvement in the regulation of the corresponding gene. a complete interacting profile between TBCs and their target genes is still lacking. the TBC2target project provides an initial groundwork for distributing computationally predicted TBC-target associations in tea health research community. the authors will focus on a development of in-deep network analysis facilities such as TBC-target interacting motif identification and TBC\u2013TBC synergistic pattern discovery. material for this article can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00211/full#supplementary-material Click here for additional data file."}
