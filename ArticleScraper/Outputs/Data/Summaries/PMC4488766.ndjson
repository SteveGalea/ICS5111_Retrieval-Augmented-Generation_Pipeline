LeTx + 45 g hmPA6. hmPA6 was found to provide good protection in rats challenged with anthrax virulence factors. hmPA6 was found to provide good protection in rats with anthrax virulence factors. hmPA6 maintained >80% cell viability with 10 g/mL LF and 0.1 g/mL PA83, while non-correlated IgG maintained only 50% cell viability. hmPA6 protected all rats from death at a concentration of 0.3 mg/kg (45 g per rat) o neutralization Reference Anti-LF LF8 Athymic nude mouse1 29 9A11 Balb/C mouse1 28 10G3, 2E7, 3F6 F344 rat1 37 5B13B1, 3C16C3 F344 rat1 30 IQNLF A/J mouse1 22 LF10E F344 rat and A/J mouse1 38 LF11H F344 rat1 38 Anti-PA Abthrax F344 rat1, hmPA6 neutralizes leTx, protects macrophages and F344 rats from anthrax-related death. hmPA6 can be used alone or in combination with other neutralizing mAbs for treatment of anthrax. construction of human/mouse chimeric antibody expression vector Total RNA was extracted from the PA6 hybridoma cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase SuperScript II according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase SuperScript II. ELISA ninety-six-well enzyme immunoassay plates were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 50 L of rPA63 antigen (2 g/mL) diluted in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) the plates were blocked and serial two-fold dilutions of hmPA6 were added to the wells (3 wells for each concentration) as the primary antibody. immunoprecipitation A mixture of PA63 and PA83 was prepared by incubating PA83 with 0.5 g/mL trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 22 \u00b0C, followed by addition of 10 g/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma)14. the mixture was incubated with 5 g of hmPA6 at 4 \u00b0C and rotated for 3 h. the immune complexes that formed were washed 3 times with gel were subjected to mass spectra identification with an ABI 4700 proteomics analyzer and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) the mass spectra were then searched within the Swiss-Prot database using the MASCOT search engine. in vivo leTx neutralization assay was performed using female Fischer 344 (F344) rats weighing between 130 and 160 g. each rat was injected via the tail vein with a mixture of PA + LF (LeTx) and different amounts of hmPA6 antibody prepared in sterile PBS. the lungs of the rats were embedded in paraffin wax at the department of pathology, Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu, China), using routine methods. sections were deparaffinized with xylene and then dehydrated in decreasing concentrations of alcohol. some sections were treated with H&E staining and examined by light microscopy. six BALB/c mice aged 7 weeks were intraperitoneally (ip) immunized with rPA63 and adjuvant. after immunization, the mouse spleen showing the best titer was removed. splenocytes were extracted and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. the In-FusionR HD Cloning Kit (Clontech) and VH and VL were amplified from right-sequenced pMD-18T vectors. the recombinant vectors were simultaneously transfected into FreeStyleTM 293-F Cells (293F) using 293fectin with the FreeStyleTM 293 Expression System (Invitrogen) non-correlated IgG1 was used as the control. the absorbance values at 450 nm of hmPA6 were plotted using GraphPad Prism. antibody-antigen complexes were isolated by running two 10% SDS-PAGE gels. one was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the other was stained with Coomassie blue. the membrane was blocked at 4 \u00b0C overnight, incubated with 1:5000 diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-PA antibody. diluted in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA-Na2, 0.05% P20; pH 7.4) to achieve different concentrations ranging from 5 to 80 nmol/L. the association time was set up at 180 s and the dissociation time, at 600 s. each rat was administered 300. the rats were treated with different concentrations of the antibody 5 min before exposure to leTx. double the complete protection dose of antibody (90 g) was injected to test its prophylactic ability. the results were analyzed according to the IHC score (IHS) as described previously36. samples with IHS 3 were considered weakly positive, while those with IHS 6 were considered strongly positive."}
