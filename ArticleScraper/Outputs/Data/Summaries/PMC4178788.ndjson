{"summary": "RV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 10 kb. the genome acts as an mRNA and contains three untranslated regions and two open reading frames (ORFs) the other ORF encodes two nonstructural proteins (NSPs), p150 and p90, which function in viral RNA replication. capsid protein interacts with viral genomic RNA and is assembled into virion. capsid protein promotes viral RNA synthesis via unknown mechanism(s) the RV strain RVi/Hiroshima.JPN/01.03[1J] was isolated in 2003 from a clinical specimen, through three passages in RK13 cells. recombinant viruses derived from this strain were propagated after one or two passages in BHK cells. the cDNA was inserted into the SpeI and EcoRI sites of a modified pUC18 vector. to insert an SP6 promoter immediately upstream from the 5\u2032 end of the genomic cDNA, the 5\u2032-terminal fragment of the RV genome was amplified by RT-PCR. they were swapped using the SpeI and SnaBI restriction enzymes. plasmid encoding the cDNA from an infectious clone was designated pHS. the resulting plasmid was encoding an infectious cDNA with the p150 gene fused to the AG1 gene (p150/AG1). a series of infectious clones, each with a single mutation in the capsid protein, were generated based on pHS-p150/AG1. expression plasmids encoding p150, the capsid protein, the E2-E1 polyprotein, or precursor SPs were generated based on the pcDNA3.1+ vector. the AG1 gene was inserted into the p150 gene in the region corresponding to amino acid positions 717 and 718 (p150/AG1) or at the N terminus (AG1p150) the quality of the synthesized viral RNAs was confirmed by electrophoresis. the culture media were replaced with fresh media at 4, 5, and 6 days posttransfection. aliquots of the culture media were harvested every 24 h until 120 h postinoculation (hpi) monolayers of vero cells in 24-well plates were inoculated with 0.1 ml of samples serially diluted 10-fold. the cells were then cultured with 0.5 ml of MEM containing 2% FBS, 0.07% sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% agarose, and antibiotics. the foci of cells expressing AG1 were counted under a fluorescence microscope. the cells were treated with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol) the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the remaining samples were pretreated with mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. chemiluminescent signals on the membranes were detected with an LAS-3000 Luminescent image analyzer (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) full-length capsid protein mRNA or a series of mutant mRNAs were synthesized from plasmids encoding corresponding cDNAs with in vitro RNA transcription. genomic replicon, BHK-HS-Rep cells, was established by selection with 2.5 g/ml puromycin. the cells were transfected with a series of plasmids expressing the SP constructs using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) the culture media were replaced with fresh media at 24 hpt and harvested after incubation for another 24 h. the whole genomic sequence of the RVi/Hiroshima.JPN/01.03[1J] strain was determined and submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database under accession number AB860305. the whole genomic sequence of the RVi/Hiroshima.JPN/01.03[1J] strain was determined and submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. anti-RV capsid protein (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti-RV E2 (Viral Antigens, Memphis, TN), anti-RV E1 (U.S. Biologicals, Salem, MA), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and anti-GAPDH (MBL, Aichi, Japan). a rabbit anti-RV p150 polyclonal antibody (22) was a kind gift from T. A forward primer SpeI-HS(+)1-26 (5\u2032-gcttactagtATTTAGGTGACACTATAGCAATGGGAGCTAACGGACCTCGCTTA-3\u2032) and reverse primer RV()1899-919 (5\u2032-atccgaattcGCACGACAAAAGCC-3\u2032) were swapped using the SpeI and SnaBI restriction enzymes. plasmid encoding an infectious cDNA with the p150 gene fused to the AG1 gene (p150/AG1) was designated pHS-p150/AG1. a series of infectious clones, each with a single mutation in the capsid protein, was generated based on pHS-p150/AG1 using PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis. the gene was inserted into the p150 gene in the region corresponding to amino acid positions 717 and 718 (p150/AG1) or at the N terminus (AG1p150) constructs containing N- or C-terminal deletions are indicated with subscript numbers. a three-tandem-FLAG epitope (3FLAG) or a three-tandem-Myc epitope (3Myc) sequence was inserted into the capsid protein gene at the aliquots of the culture media were harvested every 24 h until 120 h postinoculation. monolayers of RK13 cells in six-well plates were inoculated with rHS or rHS-p150/AG1 at a multiplicity of infection. the foci of cells expressing AG1 were counted under a fluorescence microscope. the infectious titers are expressed in fluorescent focus-forming units (FFU) the cells were inoculated with rHS or rHS-p150/AG1 at an MOI of 1.0. the samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. after five washes with Tris-HCl-buffered saline (TBS-T) the protein complexes bound to the agarose gel were dissolved by boiling the gel with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-T) sample buffer for 5 min. full-length capsid protein mRNA or a series of mutant mRNAs were synthesized from plasmids encoding the corresponding cDNAs. the quality of the synthesized RNAs was confirmed with electrophoresis. the transfected BHK cells were collected at 72 hpt. the media were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatants were layered onto 15% (wt/vol) sucrose cushions. the pellets were suspended in PBS overnight to quantify VLP production. the whole genomic sequence of the RVi/Hiroshima.JPN/01.03[1J] strain was determined and submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database under accession number AB860305. RESULTS Capsid protein colocalizes with p150 in RV-infected cells. rHS-p150/AG1 was fused to the green fluorescent protein AG1. at 36 hpi, 50% of cells showed clear p150/AG1 signals at the plasma membrane, whereas at 72 hpi, 60% of cells showed signals in the filamentous structures. the viral glycoproteins E2 and E1 rarely colocalized with p150/AG1 at either 36 or 72 hpi. the distributions of p150/AG1 were categorized into three patterns in the cells positive for both p150/AG1 and the capsid protein. the capacity of the capsid protein to interact with p150 was analyzed with co-IPA. 3FLAG-tagged C1\u2013300, C1\u2013150, C1\u2013100, C1\u201350, and C1\u201330 are added to the C terminus of 3FLAG-tagged C1\u2013300mC, FLAGC1\u2013150mC, FLAGC1\u2013100mC, FLAGC1\u201350mC, and FLAGC1\u201330mC. the short N-terminal region of the capsid protein is important for its interaction with p150. mCherry protein was fused at the C terminus. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing the series of the capsid proteins and AG1p150. the proteins were precipitated on agarose beads conjugated with an anti-FLAG antibody. the asterisk indicates the mass of the IgG light chain. mutant peptides were introduced into FLAGC1\u201330mC and 3Myc-tagged C1\u201330mC (mycC1\u201330mC) in these mutant peptides, the amino acid residue at position 9, 10, 12, 16, or 23 was replaced with an alanine. a single amino acid insertion (20P21) severely affected its self-interaction. a single insertion or substitution was introduced into C1\u201330mC tagged with 3Myc or 3FLAG at the N terminus. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing a series of FLAGC1\u201330mC constructs. the precipitates bound to agarose beads conjugated with an anti-FLAG antibody. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing the series of FLAGC1\u2013300mC-20P21, -M9A, -E10A, -L12A, -L16A, or -L23A. coimmunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting were performed as described in the legend to panel C. 30mC was not affected by E10A, which had no effect on the self-interaction of C1\u201330. these data show that the self-interacting capacity of C1\u201330 is closely associated with its capacity to interact with p150. the p150-interacting capacity of FLAGC1\u2013300 and its mutant constructs was also analyzed with co-IPA. id proteins (C1\u2013300, FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC51\u2013300, and FLAGC1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -E10A, -L12A, -L16A, and -L23A) were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, independently of the filamentous structures of p150/AG1. the self-interacting capacity of C1\u201330 is important for the capsid-p150 interaction and the viral titer of rHS-p150/AG1 containing E10A (rHS-p150/AG1-E10A) was similar to that of the parental rHS-p150/AG1. in contrast, the viral titers of rHS-p150/AG1 containing M9A, L12A, L16A, or L23A were severely reduced, although the effect of L23A was smaller than the effects of M9A, L12 replicon RNA encodes luciferase gene instead of SP gene. luciferase activity of HS-Rep-GND-P2R was as low as that of HS-Rep-GND-P2R. luciferase activity of HS-Rep-GND-P2R increased 104-fold. fluorescent signals of p150/AG1 were detected in cells expressing HS-Rep-P2R together with FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC1\u2013300-E10A, or FLAGC1\u2013300-L23A. but not in those expressing FLAGC51\u2013300 or FLAGC1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -L12A, or -L16A. p150/AG1 was expressed in cells containing the RV subgenomic replicon. fluorescent signals of p150/AG1 were observed at 72 hpt. the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production but is essential for VLP infectivity. s carrying SP/C51\u2013300 or SP/C1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -L12A, -L16A, or -L23A were 100- to 1,000-fold lower than those carrying SP/C1\u2013300 or SP/C1\u2013300-E10A. the physical amounts of VLPs, which were either infectious or noninfectious, were also evaluated. HS Rep was constructed by replacing structural genes of rHS-p150/AG1 with a puromycin resistance gene (Puro) the p150/AG1 signal was observed with fluorescence microscopy (B), and p150/AG1 and p90 were detected by immunoblotting. rHS and rHS-p150/AG1 expressing p150 fused to green fluorescent protein AG1 were generated. p150/AG1 was inserted between amino acid positions 717 and 718 within a hypervariable region of p150. the growth kinetics of rHS-p150/AG1 were similar to those of the parental rHS. majority of p150/AG1 in these distributions clearly overlapped the distribution of the capsid protein. at 36 hpi, 50% of cells showed clear p150/AG1 signals at the plasma membrane. at 72 hpi, 60% of cells showed signals in the filamentous structures. vero cells infected with rHS-p150/AG1 at an MOI of 1.0 were fixed at the indicated times and analyzed with IFAs using anti-AG1 and anti-capsid antibodies. the distributions of p150/AG1 were categorized into three patterns in the cells positive for both p150/AG1 and the capsid protein. a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, was added to the C terminus of 3FLAG-tagged C1\u2013300, C1\u2013150, C1\u2013100, C1\u201350, and C1\u201330. neither FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC101\u2013300, nor FLAGC151\u2013300 interacted with AG1p150. the short N-terminal region of the capsid protein is important for its interaction with p150. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing the series of the capsid proteins and AG1p150. the proteins were precipitated on agarose beads conjugated with an anti-FLAG antibody. asterisk indicates the mass of the IgG light chain. a series of point mutations were introduced into FLAGC1\u201330mC and 3Myc-tagged C1\u201330mC (mycC1\u201330mC) in these mutant peptides, the amino acid residue at position 9, 10, 12, 16, or 23 was replaced with an alanine. a single amino acid insertion (20P21) severely affected its self-interaction. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing a series of FLAGC1\u201330mC constructs. the precipitates bound to agarose beads conjugated with an anti-FLAG antibody. the input samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-AG1 antibody. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing the series of FLAGC1\u2013300 constructs. coimmunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting performed as described in the legend to panel C. the amount of AG1p150 that precipitated with FLAGC1\u201330mC was not affected by E10A, which had no effect on the self-interaction of C1\u201330. these data show that the self-interacting capacity of C1\u201330 is closely associated with its capacity to interact with p150. the p150-interacting capacity of FLAGC1\u2013300 and its mutant constructs was also analyzed with co-IPA. id-p150 interaction, intracellular distribution patterns of capsid protein and p150 were analyzed with IICM. vero cells were transfected with plasmids expressing individual capsid proteins (C1\u2013300, FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC51\u2013300, and FLAGC1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -E10A, -L12A, -L16A, and -L23A) the viral titer of rHS-p150/AG1 containing E10A (rHS-p150/AG1-E10A) was similar to that of the parental rHS-p150/AG1. the viral titers of rHS-p150/AG1 containing M9A, L12A, L16A, or L23A (rHS-p150/AG1-E10A, -L12A, -L16A, HS-Rep-P2R is a subgenomic replicon RNA containing a unit of the P2R reporter gene that encodes the luciferase gene instead of the SP gene. cells were transfected with HS-Rep-P2R alone or together with plasmid encoding C1\u2013300, FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC51\u2013300, or FLAGC1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A fluorescent signals of p150/AG1 were detected in cells expressing HS-Rep-P2R together with FLAGC1\u2013300, FLAGC1\u2013300-E10A, or FLAGC1\u2013300-L23A. but not in those expressing FLAGC51\u2013300 or FLAGC1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -L12A, or -L16A. t tests were used to determine significant differences between FLAGC1\u2013300 and mutant capsid constructs. the expression of the capsid protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-RV virion antibody. the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production. the infectious titers of infectious VLPs were measured at 48 hpt. the titers were 100- to 1,000-fold lower than those carrying SP/C1\u2013300 or SP/C1\u2013300-20P21, -M9A, -L12A, -L16A, or -L23A. the physical amounts of VLPs, either infectious or noninfectious, were also evaluated. the auto-interacting capacity of the N-terminal region of the capsid protein is responsible for virion infectivity but is not essential for virion formation. the subgenomic replicon, HS Rep, was constructed by replacing the structural genes of rHS-p150/AG1 with a puromycin resistance gene (Puro) the p150/AG1 signal was observed with fluorescence microscopy (B), and p150/AG1 and p90 were detected the expression levels of the structural proteins in the transfected cells were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-RV virion and anti-GAPDH antibodies. the coiled coil is a common structure that adopts a coiled-coil structure. the residues at positions a and d of a heptad repeat form a hydrophobic interface. the charged amino acid residues at positions e and g participate in the stabilization of the structure via ionic interactions. a helix-breaking proline insertion (20P21) or alanine substitutions at residues predicted to be located at the hydrophobic interface affected this self-interaction. the coiled-coil region of the capsid protein interacts with unknown host p150-binding factors. previous reports have suggested that the viral-gene-expression-promoting activity of the RV capsid protein is important in the early steps of RV infection. coiled-coil domains are also predicted in the N-terminal regions of the capsid proteins of viruses in the genus Alphavirus. this domain of the capsid protein plays a crucial role in nucleocapsid formation (25, 26, 29, 50\u201353) however, VLP production with RV mutant capsid proteins lacking the self-interacting capacity of the N-terminal region was similar to that of the VLP-wt. the auto-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production but is critical for VLP infectivity. the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production but is critical for VLP infectivity."}
