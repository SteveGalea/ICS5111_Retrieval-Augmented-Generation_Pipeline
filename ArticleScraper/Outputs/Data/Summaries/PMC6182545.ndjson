{"summary": "co-infections of respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria common in children with acute respiratory tract infection. children were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs. 76 patients had no definite viral aetiology. acute respiratory infections are responsible for 18\u201333% of all deaths. acute respiratory infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungal and atypical bacteria include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and respiratory viruses. thical statement The study followed the regulations of the medical ethical committee of the Cairo University and the medical ethical committee of the national research centre. signed consents were collected from legal child guardian before participation after explaining the purpose of the study. any child presented with influenza-like illness was considered eligible. the swab was placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube labelled with the unique patient ID. it contained 2 mL viral transport media (VTM: consisting of a sterile solution of bovine albumin fraction V, HEPES buffer, penicillin and streptomycin in HANK\u2019s balanced salt solution) the swabs were agitated vigorously for 10 seconds using a vortex mixer to free cells from the swab tip. Monoplex PCR for Adenovirus testing using primers sequence, concentrations and conditions as [14] Multiplex PCR for InfA, InfB, HMPV and RSV testing from following work [15] (Table 1) Primer list for detection of Respiratory viruses by different PCR types Virus-tested Type of PCR Primers Final Primers Conc Master Mix used Annealing Temp Ref Rhino Monoplex EVP4 5\u2019-CTACTTTGGTGTT-3\u2019 0.2 data were summarised using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum in quantitative data and using frequency (count) and relative frequency (percentage) Ethical statement The study followed the regulations of the medical ethical committee of the Cairo University and the medical ethical committee of the national research centre. the swab was inserted into the nostril and back to the nasopharynx. it was then left in place for a few seconds and slowly withdrawn. the swab was placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube labelled with the unique patient ID. e and the ala nasi by the NP swab and divided by 2, and the swab marked at this distance to ensure the insertion of the swab in the proper site. the swab was placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube labelled with the unique patient ID and containing 2 mL viral transport media (VTM: consisting of a sterile solution of bovine albumin fraction V, HEPES conventional PCR testing was done directly from the extracted nucleic acid (DNA) the kit used for complementary DNA synthesis was Sensifast cDNA (cat# BIO-65054). PCR: conventional PCR was done by 3 different reactions for each sample. mia 1 CAG AGA CTT GAA GAT GTC TTT GG 0.3M mia 2 AGC GTT CCT AGT TTT ACT TG hMPV hmpv 1 CCC TTT GTT ACT TG 0.3M mib 2 GCA GCT TCA ACA GTA GCT G Statistical method Data were coded and entered using the statistical package SPSS version 23. the most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B (Table 3). plasm, Rhinovirus and HMPV 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Rhinovirus 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae and Rhinovirus 6 Rhinovirus and HMPV 3 Mycoplasm and RSV 3 Discussion Acute respiratory disease present about 75% of all acute morbidities in developed countries. on average, five to eight respiratory viruses are detected in pediatric patients every year [17] [18]. hMPV reported prevalence ranged between 1.5 to 17.5% [26] in the current study positive samples for hMPV were 12 (9.1%), this ratio may be considered lower than similar studies. the dual viral infection or multiple viral isolates occurrence was reported by some studies [29] [30] on contrary. multiplex PCR enabled laboratorians to detect a panel of viruses simultaneously. of 1281 children, 449 (35%) had an acute respiratory tract infection caused by at least one of the organisms studied; there were 29 cases of dual infection. serology with paired samples and PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat cultures were used to identify bacteria and viruses and mixed viral/bacterial pathogens. the Large-scale multicentric studies are recommended to address the epidemiological gap. Limitation of the study Small sample size and a low number of co-infection cases preclude any robust statistical analysis."}
