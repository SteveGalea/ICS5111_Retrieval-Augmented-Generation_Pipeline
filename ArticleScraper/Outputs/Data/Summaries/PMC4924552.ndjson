{"summary": "rotaviruses are classified into 8 species (A to H) based on the genetic property of their inner capsid protein VP6 (2). the outer capsid proteins of rotaviruses are defined by the number of G and P genotypes. in 2005, 16 farms (Farm C had closed) had approximately 1500 adult cows (48 to 285/farm) and 320 growing cattle (7 to 46/farm). average renewal rates of adult milking cows per year were approximately 30% to 40%. Approximately 2/3 of replacement heifers were purchased from other dairies. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) samples were also tested for Salmonella species using a standard technique. RT-PCR Viral RNA was extracted from fecal suspensions using TRIzol LS Reagent. serum was considered RVB antibody-positive if net OD was greater than 0.2. seroresponse was defined as an increase in paired serum antibody titers to the examined virus. the products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Life Technologies) and sequenced by cycle sequencing. seroprevalence of RVB among farms or cows was statistically analyzed by the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. in 2005, 16 farms (Farm C had closed) had approximately 1500 adult cows (48 to 285/farm) and 320 growing cattle (7 to 46/farm). average renewal rates of adult milking cows per year were approximately 30% to 40%. Approximately 2/3 of replacement heifers were purchased from other dairies. dsRNA was extracted from fecal suspensions using a standard technique. RT-PCR Viral RNA was extracted from fecal suspensions using TRIzol LS Reagent (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA) serum was considered RVB antibody-positive if net OD was greater than 0.2. seroresponse was defined as an increase in paired serum antibody titers to the examined virus. the products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Life Technologies) and sequenced by cycle sequencing. phylogenetic trees were generated using the MegAlign program (Version 11.2.1) of Lasergene software. 450 out of 700 adult cows (64%) at 9 (D, E, G, J, K, L, M, P, and Q) at 9 (Farms D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, and Q) of 17 farms in a large dairy farm complex. fecal samples had not been collected from these heifers because they did not show diarrhea at the time of outbreak. all diarrheal fecal samples were negative by RT-PCR for RVA, RVC, BCV, BoTV, and BVDV. 5 showed the characteristic migration patterns of dsRNA for RVB. the migration pattern in 2002 was similar but not identical to that in 2005. using ELISA in 16 of those 20 affected cows (80%) in 2002 and in 24 of the 28 cows (86%) in 2005. paired sera from 13 of 18 normal cows (72%) also exhibited a significant seroresponse to RVB. rotavirus B (RVB) antibody detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera of adult cows at farms 4 mo before outbreak of epidemic RVB diarrhea in 2002. b Outbreak of epidemic RVB diarrhea did not occur 4 mo later. Responses to RVB in the same cattle Four of 7 cows affected by RVB diarrhea in the 2002 outbreak exhibited RVB shedding in feces again in the 2005 outbreak. nt sequences of VP7 genes from 9 RVB strains were identical at each outbreak. VP7 genes differed by 5 to 6 nts in the 2002 and 2005 strains. the length of each pair represents the distance between sequence pairs. the 5\u2032-terminal region of VP4 gene sequences from 7 RVB strains was determined and designated as D-2002, E-2002, J-2002, L-2002, L-2002, G-2005, K-2005, and L-2005. nt sequence identities of the present and Indian bovine strains were relatively low (79% to 80%) tating adult cows at Farm G spread within 2 wk to approximately 550 out of 660 adult cows (83%) at 9 of 17 farms in a large dairy farm complex. fecal samples had not been collected from these heifers because they did not show diarrhea at the time of outbreak. fecal samples collected at same time as diarrheal samples at affected farms in 2005 were negative for RVB by RT-PCR. all diarrheal fecal samples were negative by RT-PCR for RVA, RVC, BCV, BoTV, and BVDV. bovine RVB infection was considered to be the cause of both outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea. seroresponse was defined as an increase in OD of 0.2 in paired sera. paired sera from 13 of 18 normal cows also exhibited a significant seroresponse to RVB. rotavirus B (RVB) antibody detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera of adult cows at farms 4 mo before outbreak of epidemic RVB diarrhea in 2002. b Outbreak of epidemic RVB diarrhea did not occur 4 mo later. nt sequences of VP7 genes of RVB from the same farms were identical at each outbreak. nt sequences of VP7 genes of RVB from the same farms were identical at each outbreak. VP7 genes differed by 5 to 6 nts in the 2002 and 2005 strains. the 5\u2032-terminal region of VP4 gene sequences from 7 RVB strains was determined and designated as D-2002, E-2002, J-2002, J-2002, L-2002, G-2005, K-2005, and L-2005. the nt sequence identities of the present and Indian bovine strains were relatively low (79% to 80%) the epidemiology of RVB diarrhea in adult cattle remains unclear. outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea with decreases in milk production caused by RVB infection in adult cows could occur repeatedly at the same farms just like epidemic diarrhea in adult cows caused by BCV infection. nearly half of milking cows may not have experienced the 2002 outbreak at all farms. a study of human RVA infection indicated that protection against homotypic reinfection appeared to last 2 y (35) however, little information is available about immunity to RVB infection."}
