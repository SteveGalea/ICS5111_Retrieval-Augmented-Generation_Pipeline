{"summary": "emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and related severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV are linked to acute respiratory syndrome with severe outcomes. MERS-CoV can replicate in cells from a broad range of mammalian species (5, 6) the ability of a virus to counteract the early innate immune response influences virus pathogenicity and clinical outcome in patients (7). putative accessory proteins comprised 103 to 246 amino acids (aa) with expected molecular masses of 11 to 29 kDa. predicted topology of p3 and p4b revealed single transmembrane domains. p5 had three putative transmembrane domains similar to the CoV structural membrane (M) protein (16). accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 3, 4a, and 4b were PCR amplified from MERS-CoV cDNA. all ORFs were cloned into eukaryotic expression plasmid pCAGGS. expression of MERS-CoV accessory proteins was detected by immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. minor colocalizations were observed for p3 with the TGN protein LAMP-1. p5 mainly colocalized with the ERGIC marker, but not with LAMP-1. p4a (12 kDa) and p4b (29 kDa) showed a more diffuse cytoplasmic and partially nuclear distribution without any colocalization with the organelle marker proteins. protein 3 (p3) had a granular cytoplasmic distribution (FLAG/DAPI) and partially colocalized with the cellular ERGIC and the TGN marker (FLAG/TGN/DAPI) p4a and p4b were ubiquitously distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. IRF-3 is phosphorylated and dimerizes before it enters the nucleus to upregulate alpha interferon (IFN-) and beta interferon (IFN-) gene transcription (21) previously we found evidence that MERS-CoV inhibited IRF-3 activation and IFN- transcription in human cell cultures (10, 11) p4a inhibits the type I IFN induction and secretion. only p4a was able to inhibit the activation of the IFN- promoter. p4a inhibits the type I IFN induction and secretion. MA-104 cells were cotransfected with 0.25 g GFP\u2013IRF-3 and either 0.75 g RVP or p4a. after 24 h, the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 was induced by infection with RVFV Cl 13 (MOI of 5) cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG IgG (38) luciferase values of the ISG54 promoter activity were normalized to SV40 promoter-expressed RL (one of three independent experiments in triplicate) for a STAT-1 nuclear translocation assay, vero cells were transfected with 0.25 g GFP\u2013STAT-1, 0.25 g pCAGGS, 0.25 g RVP or p4a plasmid. in all p4a-transfected cells, translocation of GFP\u2013IRF-3 was inhibited 8 h postinfection with RVFV Cl 13 to an undetectable level. the accumulated amount of IFN in cell supernatant of p4a-expressing and costimulated cells was reduced by 41% at 20 h posttransfection. p4a had no or only a small influence on the IFN signaling pathway. silico analysis predicted that p4a had a dsRNA-binding domain. the predicted dsRNA-binding domain was conserved between aa positions 5 to 90. p4a inhibition of MDA5-dependent IFN induction was additionally stimulated by transfection with poly(IC), a main activator of MDA5 (20). p4a inhibition was dose dependent using plasmid concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 ng (Fig. 3C, right panel). HEK-293T cells were transfected with 0.034 g IFNbeta-Gluc (Gaussia luciferase [Gluc] under the control of IFN- promoter) and 0.01 g pEF1-Fluc (SV40 promoter regulating the firefly luciferase [Fluc] expression. the total amount of DNA was constant (0.1 g) by the addition of empty vector (pCAGGS) 20 microliters of agarose bead slurry was incubated with 400 l cell extract of HEK-293T cells transfected with 2 g plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged MDA5 or p4a. the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. p4a binds specifically to poly(IC) pretreatment of the lysates. a protein-RNA colocalization assay was done with p4a-overexpressing cells. p4a acted as an efficient type I IFN antagonist blocking the IFN induction pathway. no CoV IFN antagonists were shown to sequester dsRNA or bind MDA5 directly. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid proteins were able to block activation of dsRNA-triggered pathways by unknown mechanisms."}
