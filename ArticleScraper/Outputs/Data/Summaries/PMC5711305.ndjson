{"summary": "as of 2016, CDC has 342 staff stationed in 50 countries and 40 staff detailed to international organizations. starting in 2009, CDC hired local emergency coordinators in Guatemala, Kenya, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Thailand, and china. the CDC emergency coordinators have been a valuable asset in this endeavor by providing technical knowledge in emergency preparedness and cultural understanding of the local context. CDC continues to host delegations and collaborates with local partners in Atlanta to enable visitors to observe PHEM at federal, state, and local levels. fellows from china hosted a year-long study tour to learn how CDC manages public health emergencies. CDC trained 39 fellows from 25 countries by December 2016. worldwide need increased for guidelines and standards for building PHEM capacity. by June 2012, only \"42 of 193 [21.76%] States Parties declared that they had met their core capacity requirements\" CDC worked with the countries to develop SOPs and provide emergency management training for their PHEOC staff. each country underwent a series of drills to demonstrate its increased capacity in the target areas. each country underwent a series of drills to demonstrate its increased capacity in the target areas. GHSA provides technical assistance to 17 countries through a comprehensive PHEM program. CDC provides technical assistance to 17 countries in 3 areas: training and mentoring of PHEM staff; reinforcing sufficient PHEOC infrastructure; and developing streamlined systems. CDC developed a standardized package of technical assistance activities using a variety of foundational emergency management documents. CDC then worked with ministries of health to customize work plans based on the country\u2019s baseline capacity and 5-year strategic goals for a PHEOC. the effect of this work has been demonstrated in multiple ways. the ministry of health has trained permanent PHEOC staff, developed plans and procedures, and participated in 2 simulation exercises. the PHEOC assets have been linked to national systems in public health surveillance, laboratory, human resources, and other sectors through joint strategic planning and simulation exercises. CDC worked with the countries to develop SOPs and provide emergency management training for their PHEOC staff. each country underwent a series of drills to demonstrate its increased capacity in the target areas and showed significant improvements. GHSA is an international collaboration between partner nations and international organizations intended to serve as a roadmap for countries to reach the capacities outlined in IHR 2005. GHSA provides technical assistance to 17 countries in 3 areas. a fully coordinated response can be accomplished only through a comprehensive PHEM program. CDC provides technical assistance to 17 countries. CDC participated in GHSA launch meetings in 17 countries. countries developed 1-year work plans based on 5-year roadmaps. CDC then worked with ministries of health to customize work plans. CDC, the DOD\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and USAID have developed a national-level PHEOC. the PHEOC assets have been linked to national systems in public health surveillance, laboratory, human resources, and other sectors. both Cameroon and Senegal are emerging as regional PHEM leaders. CDC participates in WHO-led initiatives as subject matter experts in joint external evaluations. CDC also provides the African Union with emergency management training and technical assistance. CDC and other international partners have provided technical assistance and resources. but transitioning to managing public health emergencies through a PHEOC still requires commitment and input from a ministry of health. Efforts to strengthen PHEM capacity must build on existing emergency response structures. any augmentation of technology and infrastructure also should improve nonemergency capability. ize the PHEM approach to respond to public health emergencies by continuing to assist WHO through initiatives such as EOC-NET. CDC aims to reach its goal of saving lives and protecting people while making the world safer from disease outbreaks and other public health threats."}
