{"summary": "METHODS We measured the expression levels of MAN1A1, MAN1A2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1 in cell lines HepG2.2.15, HepN10, HepAD38 and HepG2 by Western blot. the expression levels of -1,2-mannosidase were higher in stably transfected HBV cells than in controls. transfecting HepG2 cells with a component of the HBV viral envelope also increased the expression of -1,2-mannosidases. however, MK886 did not affect the expression of MAN1C1 in AD38 cells without tetracycline in the culture medium. the mechanisms behind immune escape mediated by DC-SIGN remain unclear. it may be that DC-SIGN directly recognizes mannose oligosaccharides found on the viral envelope of HBV. a high-mannose type HBV produced by the application of a class I -mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine. ases include the ER -1, 2-mannosidase I (MAN1B1), -mannosidase IB (MAN1A2), and -mannosidase IC (MAN1C1). MAN1B1 trims -1,2-mannose from Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, and then MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 trim the residual -1,2-mannose, to generate Man5 HBV infection increases the expression of -mannosidase I in the host cells. in turn, DC-SIGN can no longer recognize the HBV glycoprotein coat. the virus escapes from immune attack. genes of HBV (i.e., Ptt22-HBx, Ptt22-preS2, Ptt22-preS1, Ptt22-HBc, and Ptt22-HBp) and the control plasmid (Ptt22-vector) were a kind gift from Dr. Quan Yuan and Tianying Zhang. transfections with plasmids were performed using lipofectamine 2000 Reagent. mouse anti-HBs, anti-HBx, anti-HBp, and anti-HBc antibodies were provided by Dr. Quan Yuan from Xiamen university. mouse anti-actin (Proteintech; 1:1000 dilution) was used as a reference for protein quantification. cells were cultured in DMEM at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. the medium was supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 IU/mL streptomycin. cells were changed into fresh medium every third day, and split by trypsinization at a confluence of about 90%. PPAR (MK886) and PPAR (GW9662) inhibitors were used at a concentration of 10 mol/L, unless otherwise noted. patient samples Human liver tissues were obtained from patients who were treated at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology between July 2014 and December 2014. mouse anti-actin (Proteintech; 1:10000 dilution) was used as a reference for protein quantification. goat anti-rabbit IgG (Proteintech; 1:10000 dilution) and donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz; 1:10000 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. the expression of HBV genes in the AD38 cell line was restricted in the presence of Tet. when Tet was absent, these cells produced 3.5 kb HBV pregenomic RNA. -1,2-mannosidase expression was higher than in cells with Tet. the expression of -1,2-mannosidase in all the cell lines was positively correlated with the expression of HBsAg. levels of -1,2-mannosidase in non-tumorous liver tissues were higher than in non-tumorous liver tissues of the HBV-related HCC patients. -1,2-mannosidase is upregulated in the HBs, preS2 and preS1-transfected hepatoma cells. plasmids containing seven individual viral genes of HBV were transfected into HepG2 cells. -1,2-mannosidases are upregulated in the HBs, preS2 and preS1-transfected hepatoma cells. hepatitis B virus protein expression and effect on MAN1C1 (A) HBp: Plasmids (PTT22-HBp) were transfected into HepG2 cells. MK886 could neutralize the effects of HBV. MK886 neutralizes the effects of HBV on MAN1C1 (A) Western blot showed that the expression of MAN1C1 did not alter in HepAD38 cells without Tet compared to that in the HepAD38 cells with Tet. the expression of HBV genes in the AD38 cell line was restricted in the presence of Tet. when Tet was absent, these cells produced 3.5 kb HBV pregenomic RNA. -1,2-mannosidase expression in the cells without Tet was higher than in cells with Tet. mannosidase and virus secretion were assessed in the cell culture supernatants of various HBV cell lines. AD38 without Tet showed the highest secretion of HBV-DNA (107.8 0.1 IU/mL), HBeAg (21.9 0.8 NCU/mL) and HBsAg (87.5 2.4 IU/mL) the expression of -1,2-mannosidase in all the cell lines was positively correlated with the expression of HB -1,2-mannosidase is upregulated in HBs, preS2 and preS1-transfected hepatoma cells. plasmids containing seven individual viral genes of HBV were transfected into HepG2 cells. -1,2-mannosidases are upregulated in the HBs, preS2 and preS1-transfected hepatoma cells. HBs: Plasmids (PTT22-HBV) were transfected into HepG2 cells. HBp: Plasmids (PTT22-HBp) were transfected into HepG2 cells. MK886 could neutralize the effects of HBV. MK886 neutralizes the effects of HBV on MAN1C1 (A) Western blot showed that the expression of MAN1C1 did not alter in HepAD38 cells without Tet. there was no effect of GW9662 on the expression of MAN1C1 in AD38 cells with or without Tet treatment. NB-DNJ was previously shown to prevent the HBV from correct folding and the release of viral envelope molecules. but it did increase its recognition by DC-SIGN, resulting in activation of the immune response[8,9]. Moreover, the upregulation of host -mannosidases by HBV appears to contribute to viral escape[10]. PPAR pathway inhibited MAN1C1 expression with GW9662. but inhibition of the PPAR pathway did not affect MAN1C1 expression. the findings suggest that the class I -mannosidases could be used as drug targets to inhibit the demannosylation of HBV. this could improve the binding of the virus to DC-SIGN and disrupt the immune tolerance to prevent and treat viral infection. an estimated 2 billion people are infected, and more than 350 million are chronic carriers of the virus. research frontiers Few studies have investigated the effects of HBV on the expression of class I -mannosidases. the authors hypothesized that HBV could promote the demannosylation of the viral protein by increasing the expression of -mannosidase 1 in the host cells. the authors will consider all the mannosidase members and explain the correlation between HBV production, mannosidase level and HBV glycosylation status in future experiments."}
