{"summary": "the response consisted of an information phase (March 18\u2013May 14, 2003), a screening phase (May 14\u2013July 5, 2003), and a special measures phase (March 13\u2013July 5, 2003). on arrival, posters directed passengers to pick up health information about symptoms and signs of SARS and advised them to consult a physician if a SARS-like illness developed after their arrival in Canada. all passengers were required to circle \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses. responses were verified either by customs officials (for inbound passengers) or by airline check-in agents (for departing passengers from Toronto Pearson Airport) passenger contact tracing evolved throughout the SARS outbreak. from march 13 to march 21, 2003, contact tracing included follow-up of passengers seated in the same row, 2 rows in front, and 2 rows behind someone with a probable case who was symptomatic while in flight. as of march 31, contact tracing was expanded again to include all passengers on a given flight with a probable or suspected case who were symptomatic while in flight (6). HANs were provided to inbound passengers at 18 land border crossings. no record was kept of how many passengers picked up HANs. health Canada implemented similar HANs in a different color (cherry) to mitigate the risk of exporting SARS cases. 82% of departing passengers received a cherry card at check-in. 73% were questioned about their responses by the check-in ticket agent. a passenger was released or referred to a predetermined hospital for an in-depth medical evaluation. health Canada personnel encountered excessive delays in obtaining the manifests from various airlines. Upon landing, all forms were collected from passengers by health Canada personnel and retained for possible contact tracing if a case was subsequently identified. the traveler contact information rorm reduced the time for securing the manifest from weeks to 2 days. a total of 1,172,986 persons received either yellow or cherry HANs as of July 5, 2003. none of the 411 outbound passengers who were referred for secondary screening in Toronto were asked to defer their travel. no data were collected to correlate thermal scanner results with results of temperature taking by secondary screening nurses. some of the persons arriving or departing Toronto and Vancouver airports were screened by both HAN and thermal scanning measures. the 11 persons had symptoms at the time of travel, but both would have been cleared by the criteria established in the secondary screening protocol. the 11 persons had symptoms at the time of travel, but both would have been cleared by the criteria established in the secondary screening protocol. the effectiveness of screening measures for detecting SARS cases at border points of entry was limited by two factors: first, screening measures themselves, i.e., thermal scanning machines, were nonspecific for SARS. the prevalence of SARS among international passengers was low. no data are available to assess whether or not the measures implemented at the airports actually generated confidence or reassurance in the public. available screening measures for SARS were limited in their effectiveness in detecting SARS among inbound or outbound passengers from SARS-affected areas."}
