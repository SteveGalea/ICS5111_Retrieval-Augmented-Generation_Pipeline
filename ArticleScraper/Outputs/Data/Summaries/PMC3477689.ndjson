{"summary": "pleural effusion is a common medical problem in the chest. congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, adenocarcinoma, and pneumonia are common diseases that cause pleural effusions. there is no rapid and accurate diagnostic method for pleural effusion. ACE2 reduces the generation of Ang II by catalysing the conversion of Ang I to Ang1-9. Ang1-7 has been recognised as a potential endogenous inhibitor of the classical RAS cascade 7. abnormally elevated ACE combined with decreased ACE2 expression may be involved in fibrotic processes in vitro and in vivo. pleural effusions were divided into 45 transudative pleural effusions and 80 exudative pleural effusions. exudative pleural effusions were divided into tuberculous pleural effusions (20 patients), pneumonia pleural effusions (32 patients), and malignant pleural effusions. ACE and ACE2 activity assay expressed as ngml-1. pleural effusions from 125 patients were processed in our laboratory from august 2010 to December 2011. pleural effusions were divided into 45 transudative pleural effusions and 80 exudative pleural effusions. exudative pleural effusions were divided into tuberculous pleural effusions (20 patients), pneumonia pleural effusions (32 patients), and malignant pleural effusions (28 patients). the gelatinase activities were identified as clear zones against a blue background on the SDS-PAGE and quantified using Scion Image software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) ACE and ACE2 activity assay ACE and ACE2 activities were assayed with the fluorogenic substrates Mca-YVADAPK and Mca-APK-Dnp. pleural fluid characteristics of 125 patients included in the study are presented in Table 1. total protein, LDH, and the number of WBC in exudative effusions were significantly higher than those in transudative effusions (n = 45) whereas a lower glucose level was detected in the pleural fluid of exudates compared with that in transudates (p 0.001) ACE2 activity in exudative effusions was lower than that in transudative effusions (1.58 (1.02-2.54) RFUh-1ml-1 vs. 1.98 (1.27-3.12) RFUh-1ml-1). the ratio of ACE/ACE2 activity in the pleural effusions was significantly higher in exudative effusions. ACE and ACE2 activities were measured in each sample of pleural transudative effusions (A; n = 45) and exudative effusions (B; n = 80) for correlation analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis (SPSS statistics package, Chicago, IL) was applied. the gelatinase activities detected in this study were based on pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and pro-MMP-9 (95 kDa) each symbol represents one individual, and horizontal bars represent median values. ACE activity in the tuberculous effusions was significantly higher than in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. ACE2 activity in the tuberculous effusions was significantly lower than in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. ACE and ACE2 activities in transudates, tuberculous, pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions were 0.67 0.52, 2.16 0.97, 0.74 0.77 and 0.82 0.43 RFU/hour/ml. both of ACE and ACE2 activities in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions were similar to the activities in transudative effusions. the gelatinase activities detected in this study were based on pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and pro-MMP-9 (95 kDa) each symbol represents one individual, and horizontal bars represent median values. * and ** indicate p 0.05 and p 0.01, respectively, compared with values measured in Pn and/or Ad effusions. ACE activity in exudative effusions was higher than that in transudative effusions. the ratio of ACE/ACE2 activity in the pleural effusions was significantly higher in exudative effusions than in transudative effusions. pleural effusion (20 l) was assayed for the ability to cleave the substrate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour with a specific ACE inhibitor or a specific ACE2 inhibitor. each symbol represents one individual, and horizontal bars represent median values. p 0.01 and p 0.001 respectively, compared with transudates. the activities of MMP-2 (A) and MMP-9 (B) in pleural transudative and exudative effusions from 125 patients were determined with zymography. each symbol represents one individual, and horizontal bars represent median values. ACE activity and an elevated ACE/ACE2 ratio were observed in exudates. we differentiated both ACE and ACE2 activities in the exudates according to different diseases, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and adenocarcinoma. pleural ACE and ACE2 activities among transudates, tuberculosis, pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions were 0.67 0.52, 2.16 0.97, 0.74 0.77 and 0.82 0.43 RFU/hour/ml. both of ACE and ACE2 activities in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions were similar to the activities in transudative effusions. the activities of MMP-2 (A) and MMP-9 (B) in TB (n = 20), Pn (n = 32), and Ad (n = 28) effusions were based on pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and pro-MMP-9 (95 kDa) each symbol represents one individual, and horizontal bars represent median values. significant positive correlation between ACE and ACE2 activity in transudates suggests that ACE and ACE2 maintain a normal physiological balance. ACE activity was increased (p 0.001) and ACE2 decreased (p 0.05) in tuberculosis specifically. pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions were 1.38 0.58, 2.05 1.40 and 2.38 1.86 RFU/hour/ml (mean SD), respectively. the ACE2 activity in both groups was significantly larger than that in the tuberculosis group. Ang 1-7 revealed anti-migration and anti-invasion effect mediated by inactivation of PI3K/Akt, P38 and JNK signal pathways. reduction in ACE2 along with induction of MMP-9 activity occurred in tuberculous effusions. the proteolytic action of MMPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, like many other diseases associated with tissue destruction. studies have evaluated MMPs in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with patients with transudative effusions 10, 32. our findings suggest that increased ACE and MMP-9 activities and decreased ACE2 activity in pleural fluid are features of pleural space infection in patients with pleural tuberculosis."}
