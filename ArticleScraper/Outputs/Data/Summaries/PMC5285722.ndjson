{"summary": "doxycycline (DOX) is a second-generation tetracycline derivative used widely in pig husbandry. doxycycline (DOX) is a second-generation tetracycline derivative used widely in pig husbandry. bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit blocks recruitment of aminoacyl-tRNA into the bacterial ribosome, which inhibits protein synthesis. this antibiotic can destroy mitochondrial dynamics and promotes the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in cells. non-transformed intestinal cell line originally derived from jejunal epithelia isolated from a neonatal, unsuckled piglet. cells were seeded in plastic tissue culture flasks (25 cm2 flasks) at a density of 2 105/ml and passaged every 72\u201390 h for a maximum of 30 passages. pLVX-mitomCherry-IRES-EGFP-LC3B, pLVX-EGFP-LC3, PLVX-mRFP-EGFP-LC3, pLVX-mRFP-EGFP-LC3, pLVX-mRFP-EGFP-BclxL, were kept in our laboratory. lentiviral supernatant was added to the cells with the supplement of Polybrene (8 mg/ml) at cells were incubated with 10 M DCFH-DA or 5 M MitoSox serum-free medium for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were stained with 1 g/ml Rhodamine 123 for 25 min at 37\u00b0C. after staining, cells were then washed with PBS and analyzed at FL-1. cells were harvested and washed once with PBS, then resuspended in 100 l binding buffer followed by incubation with 10 l Annexin V per test for 20 min. all data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Version 7.6.5, Tree Star Inc. Ashland, Oregon) all of the experiments were performed in three independent experiments. western blot analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with DOX at the concentrations indicated for 24 h. cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 5 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were infected with TGEV at 5% CO2 atmosphere. mouse anti-tubulin and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Multisciences (Haimen, China) reagents used in this study were chloroquine (CQ) and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. cell viability was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. cell viability was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide. cells were stained by MitoTracker for 25 min at 37\u00b0C. then washed with PBS and analyzed at FL-1 and FL-3. cells were harvested and washed once with PBS. western blot analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. fluorescence microscopy Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. cells were incubated with DAPI (blue) to stain the nucleus. the images were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. feed were detected in IPEC-J2 cells after a 24-h incubation. flow cytometry did not reveal any distinct apoptosis in DOX-treated cells. data are means standard deviations of three independent experiments. effects of DOX on IPEC-J2 cell mitochondria Mitochondria are major sites for the generation of ROS. antibiotics that induce mitochondrial dysfunction could cause oxidative damage in mammalian cells. Dysfunctional non-respiring (MitoTracker green-positive, MitoTracker red-negative) mitochondria increased dramatically after DOX treatment. DOX could induce oxidative stress and increase the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in IPEC-J2 cells. LC3 is a labeling protein found on the autophagosome membrane. newly synthesized LC3 is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. LC3I is transformed into LC3II when autophagy occurs. a simple assessment of LC3II levels or LC3-positive vesicles cannot distinguish between the two scenarios. we used the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter construct to measure autophagic flux. autophagosomes have both GFP and mRFP signals, whereas red fluorescence is not. IPEC-J2 cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3 were treated with rapamycin or CCCP+CQ and stained with DAPI. the number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell was quantified. FP-LC3B-IRES-mito-mCherry transfected the lentiviral vector into IPEC-J2 cells to detect mitophagy induced by DOX. a sensitive dual-fluorescence reporter expressing mRFP-GFP-mito fused in-frame to a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Bcl-xL transmembrane structure) to monitor mitophagy and lysosomes for degradation. green fluorescence indicates autophagosomes, and red fluorescence indicates mitochondria. higher-magnification images represent regions enclosed in black squares. RT-PCR for GAPDH was used as an internal control. RNA expression levels normalized relative to those of mock cells are shown. IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with or without 50 g/ml DOX for 24 h. EV titers were quantified using a viral plaque assay. the viral plaque formation clearly showed that DOX increased TGEV replication significantly. DOX clearly suppressed the antiviral innate immunity of IPEC-J2 cells. fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AnnexinV and propidium iodide examined apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. the flow cytometric analysis did not reveal any distinct apoptotic changes in DOX-treated IPEC-J2 cells after 24 h of treatment. mitochondrial-specific ROS indicator MitoSox was used to examine mitochondrial ROS levels. mitochondrial-targeted MitoSox generated red fluorescence. mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by Rh123. oTracker red-negative mitochondria increased dramatically after DOX treatment. DOX could induce oxidative stress and increase the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in IPEC-J2 cells. LC3 is a labeling protein found on the autophagosome membrane. newly synthesized LC3 is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. LC3I is transformed into LC3II when autophagy occurs. a simple assessment of LC3II levels or LC3-positive vesicles cannot distinguish between the two scenarios. we used the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter construct to measure autophagic flux. red fluorescence is attenuated in the acidic pH of the lysosome. the number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell was quantified. IPEC-J2 cells stably expressing monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-EGFP-LC3 were treated with rapamycin or CCCP+CQ for 12 h. mRFP-GFP-mito fused in-frame to mitochondrial targeting sequence. many bright red color-labeled mitochondria were present as puncta after different incubation durations with DOX. arrows at the ctrl point are normal mitochondria with clear cristae. IPEC-J2 cells stably expressing monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Bcl-xL were treated with CCCP, CCCP + CQ, or DOX + CQ for 24 h. these cells were stained with DAPI and observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with or without 50 g/ml DOX for 24 h. mRNA expression levels were normalized to the GAPDH mRNA level in each sample. TGEV titers were quantified by TCID50 DOX pretreatment. DOX clearly suppressed the antiviral innate immunity of IPEC-J2 cells. cells were treated with DOX at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. the gastrointestinal tract can be exposed to high concentrations of DOX after ingestion of feed or drinking water with 100\u2013200 mg/kg doxycycline. the concentration of DOX used in the individual applications can be 100 g/ml. three studies have reported that DOX decreases mitochondrial membrane potential. the number of dysfunctional mitochondria increased significantly in IPEC-J2 cells after DOX incubation. HBV favors its own replication by promoting bulk autophagy. the late stages of mitophagy must be completed to attenuate RLR signaling (Xia et al., 2014)."}
