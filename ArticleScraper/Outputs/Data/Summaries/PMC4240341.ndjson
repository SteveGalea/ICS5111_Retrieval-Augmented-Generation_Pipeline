{"summary": "clinical presentation and management of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections in immunocompromised children is not well understood. hMPV is a paramyxovirus first identified in 2001 as a pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. clinical disease most closely resembles that associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), a related paramyxovirus. hMPV is also associated with acute otitis media, as well as more rarely conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and rash [6, 7]. of 368 total patients with positive hMPV laboratory results, we performed retrospective chart review to identify a subset of 55 patients with immunocompromised conditions. we defined an immunocompromised condition as presence of hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, rheumatologic disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant, primary immunodeficiency, receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy. infections were defined as nosocomial if the patient was hospitalized within 7 days of diagnosis. Mortality attributable to hMPV was defined as death due to respiratory failure from pneumonia during the hospitalization where hMPV was diagnosed. hMPV was considered a contributor to lung injury. eight (15%) hMPV infections were acquired nosocomially, while 46 (85%) were community acquired. of these 46 cases, 24 (52%) patients were hospitalized for evaluation of their hMPV infection. children presenting with LRTIs did not differ by age (P =.80) or presence of fever (P =.70), cough (P = 1.00), neutropenia (P =.21), or lymphopenia (P =.09). compared to those presenting with URTI, children presenting with LRTIs did not differ by age (P =.80) or presence of fever (P =.70), cough (P = 1.00), neutropenia (P =.21 bSevere disease is defined as intensive care unit stay and/or use of supplemental oxygen (FiO2 0.28) samples tested included nasal wash (n = 43; 91%), BAL (n = 1; 2%), or both (n = 3; 6%). 2 children with SCID and 1 with aplastic anemia died due to hMPV infection. two of these transplant recipients subsequently died due to hMPV infection. median number of samples collected was 7 (range, 2\u201344 samples) median duration of follow-up was 37 days (range, 4\u2013562 days) types of samples included two BAL, one sinus biopsy, and one BAL sample in Patient 1. median viral load was estimated as 6.96 log10 copies/mL. eight (89%) of these treated patients had fever, 6 (75%) had cough, and 7 (78%) had abnormal chest imaging. five (56%) were hospitalized in the ICU, and 5 (56%) received supplemental oxygen. of the 5 HSCT recipients, 3 (60%) had hMPV detected prior to transplant. 55 hMPV-infected immunocompromised patients were identified from may 29, 2006 to march 26, 2010. the median age was 5 years (range, 5 months\u201319 years) of these patients, most had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 21; 88%) of these patients, most had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 21; 88%). the overall characteristics of the hMPV illness episodes are listed in Table 2. the majority of patients presented with fever (n = 44; 80%) and/or cough (n = 42; 82%) treatment received Ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin 5 (9) Ribavirin alone 2 (4) Intravenous immunoglobulin alone 2 (4) Receipt of antibiotics 22 (40) hMPV is defined as intensive care unit stay and/or use of supplemental oxygen. nine (16%) patients were HSCT recipients. indications for transplant included aplastic anemia (n = 4, 44%), SCID (n = 2, 22%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 1, 11%), osteopetrosis (n = 1, 11%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 1, 11%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1, 11%). eight (15%) patients were solid organ transplant recipients. median time from transplant to hMPV infection was 12 months. none required ICU stay or supplemental oxygen. none received treatment with ribavirin or IVIG. treatment of hMPV Nine patients were treated for their hMPV infections. these patients included 5 HSCT recipients, 2 patients with hematologic malignancy and 2 patients with solid tumors. eight (89%) of these treated patients had fever, 6 (75%) had cough, and 7 (78%) had abnormal chest imaging. three patients (5%) died of respiratory failure related to hMPV pneumonia. one HSCT recipient had not engrafted at time of death, while the other engrafted the day prior to death. the third death occurred in a patient with ALL and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia on salvage chemotherapy. more recently, pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza A were associated with LRTI rates of 20\u201342% and 4\u201327% and mortality rates of 10\u201312% and 2\u20134% respectively. a larger group of patients described a lower rate of LRTI (16%) associated with pandemic H1N1 with only 1 severe case, with no related mortality. pneumonia despite use of ribavirin and IVIG is being used at our institution for severely immunocompromised individuals. treatment with IVIG and ribavirin is currently being used at our institution for severely immunocompromised individuals. hMPV-positive cases were missed through use of DFA as compared to PCR. the comparison of outcomes in patients who did and did not receive treatment is problematic. a prospective randomized study of ribavirin and IVIG administration would be helpful. in adult HSCT recipients [9, 13] and highlights the need for treatment options."}
