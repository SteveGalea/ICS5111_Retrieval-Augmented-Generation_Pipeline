{"summary": "a multicomponent drug from traditional medicine is one of the research directions for treating MRSA infections. we are expecting to clarify the synergetic and antagonistic actions and seek the optimal combination of BAs which manifest the strongest anti-MRSA activity. checkerboard microdilution is one of the commonly used assays for two-component combinations that can quickly screen the antimicrobial activity. the detection sensitivity of this method could be much improved by adding the fluorescent dye of resazurin, which makes it an accurate method for determining the antimRSA activity of BAs. culture MRSA Srain (ATCC43300), Escherichia coli (E. coli, CCTCC AB91112), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, CCTCC AB910393), Shigella dysenteriae (S. dysenteriae, CCTCC AB210562), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumonia, ATCC49619), and Candida albicans (C. albican resazurin is a blue dye that is nonfluorescent until it is reduced to the pink colored and highly red fluorescent resorufin. it has a large change in perceived color hue when the thickness or concentration of an observed sample increases or decreases. the fluorescence intensity was determined 17 h after the experiment. the five test concentrations for each compound were chosen by first determining the EC50 of each compound as a single agent in this assay. each combination was then scored to identify antibacterial effects that were greater than the effects of the individual components. the highest single agent model is the larger of the effects produced by each of the combination's single agents at the same concentrations as in the mixture. the 5 components were set as 5 factors and each factor contained 5 levels (from 100 to 500 g/mL with the interval of 100 g/mL) coded as 2, 1, 0, +1, and +2. the factor level table was designed for the experimental design of combination. mice were infected with 0.1 mL of inoculum of MRSA (2 106 cfu/mL) in warmed saline. a group of mice were inoculated with 0.1 ml of 2 106 cfu/mL suspensions per mouse as negative control. surviving mice were killed by CO2 exposure. the significance level was defined as P 0.01. the broth culture medium contained 10 g peptone, 6 g beef extract, and 5 g NaCl dissolving. strains were inoculated into 25 mL broth culture medium in 100 mL wide-mouthed glass bottle and incubated in a shaker for 8 h at 37\u00b0C. the bacteria were transformed and grown in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB), which was prepared from 17.5 g casein acid hydrolysate, 3 g beef extract, and 1.5 g starch dissolving in 1000 mL distilled water. the concentrations of the extracts of BAs were 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, and 4 g/mL for rows 1\u201310. rows 11 and 12 were set as infected control (containing bacteria but no extract) and noninfected medium control (containing neither extract nor bacteria) the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) was calculated by the checkerboard assay. the MIC represents the sum of the FICs of each drug tested, where the FIC is determined for each drug when used in combination by the MIC of each drug when used alone. improved broth microdilution was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity of different BA combinations on E. coli, S. aureus, S. dysenteriae, S. pneumonia, and C. albicans. mice were homogenized in sterile 0.9% saline. serial dilutions were plated onto sabouraud dextrose agar to calculate the cfus after 48 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C. the sequence of the activity of alkaloids was Ber > Cop > Jat > Pal > Epi. this test adopted resazurin for fluorescent determination. it showed that the density of MRSA increased significantly after being incubated for 24 h. there have been no reports on the combinations of ingredients in traditional medicine. alkaloids had anti-MRSA activity, but the activity was relatively weak compared with antibiotics. ciprofloxacin had multiple drug resistance which resulted in low absolute concentration inside the cell membrane. the results showed two regularities: ergistic effect, and green indicates strong synergistic effect. the interactions between BAs were related to their concentrations, and the interactions changed along with the change of the concentrations. the combinations of Ber and Epi showed intensive synergistic effect within the test concentrations. median effect and isobolographic analyses effectively identify combinations in which one drug enhances the potency of the other drug. a total of 36 experiments were designed, and the protocol and results were shown in Table 1. the lack of fit test of regression equation F1 = MS lack of fit/MS error = 7.0009 > F0.01 (6, 9), F3 = MS regression/MS error = 9.33 > F0.01 indicating significant. therefore, the regression result was reliable. 23.8 28 0 0 0 0 0 0 41.8 29 0 0 0 0 0 0 42.8 30 0 0 0 0 0 0 28.6 31 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 44.9 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 30.3 35 0 0 0 0 0 41.5 36 0 0 0

predicted values. the optimal combination in 3.3 had the strongest inhibiting effects on E. coli, S. aureus, S. dysenteriae, and S. pneumonia. i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide at a dosage of 100 mg/kg (body weight) once daily for 3 consecutive days to specific pathogen-free female ICR mice. to test the model, mice were infected with 0.1 mL of MRSA suspension of 2 105 blastospores per mouse in
