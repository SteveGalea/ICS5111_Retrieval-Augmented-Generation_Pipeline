{"summary": "the IRE1 lumenal domain at the N-terminus serves as a UPR sensor domain. IRE1 dimerizes or oligomerizes in the plane of the ER membrane. the trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of IRE1 is suggested to permit unfettered binding to nucleotides (nt) the IRE1-dependent mRNA cleavage is an unconventional splicing. it occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm in a spliceosome-independent manner. IRE1 catalyzes the cleavage at the conserved sites in both of the 7-nt loops of the mRNA precursors unspliced HAC1 (HAC1 U) and XBP1 (XBP1 U), excising a 252- and 26- XBP1 U complexes with the XBP1 S protein, which is more stable and transcriptionally active for UPR target genes. XBP1 S action is shut down during the later phase of ER stress, and XBP1 U is thus regarded as an inhibitor of the UPR in higher eukaryotes. bZIP60 mRNA is spliced to remove a 23-bp fragment in Arabidopsis. a translational frame-shift occurs downstream of the splicing sites and eliminates a single transmembrane domain (TMD) encoded by unspliced bZIP60 to produce bZIP60 S. ire1a-2, SALK_018112, ire1a-3, WiscDsLox420D09, ire1a-4, SAIL_1256_F04 and ire1a-4 mutants showed that IRE1A has little effect on the bZIP60 mRNA splicing in Arabidopsis seedlings. but the single IRE1B mutation does not affect the bZIP60 splicing caused by Tm treatment IRE1A and IRE1B are functionally redundant for the production of bZIP60 S. this is the first report showing that a biological process in plants is regulated by a single UPR pathway. IRE1 and bZIP60 mRNA pair mediating viral infection is independent of the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway. the bZIP60 S greatly accumulated at 2.5 and 5.5 days post-infection (dpi) compared with the controls. the absence of the 23-bp intron in the amplified products was confirmed by colony diagnostic testing and DNA sequencing. the mRNA level of bZIP60 S and bZIP60 U was determined by qRT-PCR. Actin II and CP were analyzed as a control and an indicator of TuMV infection. expression of bZIP60 was increased at 3, 6 and 9 dpi in local inoculation leaves. expression of ER marker gene CRT was also up-regulated at 3 dpi. bZIP60 signaling pathway is indeed activated in both local and systemic leaves. NtbZIP60 mRNA was predicted to fold a conserved twin hairpin loop. the sequence in the double hairpin loop region is nearly identical in at least 20 bZIP60 homologues in plants. this suggests that NtbZIP60 is a potential target of unconventional splicing in N. benthamiana. RNA was extracted from un-infiltrated leaves (Blank) and leaves infiltrated with buffer, GV3101, GV3101 containing TuMV infectious clone and pCabmibia1302 were used as controls. genemic DNA was also analyzed as a control by qRT-PCR. the level of the virus was much lower in the wild type and bzip60-1 mutant. bZIP60 S transcripts were significantly accumulated in the systemically infected leaves of both wild type and bzip60-1 plants inoculated with TuMV. in contrast, no bZIP60 S was detectable in the bzip60-2 mutant either under or without TuMV attack. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 are non-RNA null mutants and Transcribe Incomplete bZIP60 ORF. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 are non-RNA null mutants. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 are homozygous mutant lines. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 do not express full-length bZIP60 transcripts. a 23-bp sequence within the second exon to be spliced through unconventional splicing is represented by a red rectangle. bzip60-1 mutant produces shorter version of bZIP60 ORF (bZIP60N) bzip60-1 is a Knockdown Mutant and bzip60-2 a bZIP60 Splicing Knockout Mutant. bzip60-1 mutant produces shorter version lacking the N-terminal 50 amino acids (aa) expression levels of bZIP60 in the wild type and bZIP60N in the bzip60-1 mutant were quantitatively determined using a primer set sitting between MF and MR. the bZIP60C transcript in the bzip60-2 mutant accumulated to a level similar to bZIP60 mRNA in the wild type (S9A Fig, P0.01). treatment of Arabidopsis with ER stress agents induces bZIP60 mRNA splicing. bzip60-1 seedlings produced the detectable spliced form of bZIP60 mRNA. the level of bZIP60N S in the bzip60-1 mutant was lower than that in the wild type. bzip60-1 mutant is a bZIP60 expression knockdown mutant. bzip60-2 mutant is a bZIP60 splicing knockout mutant. both bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S contain five NLS consensus motifs. bZIP60 and bZIP60N are highly conserved in at least 20 plant homologues. LS1, NLS3 and NLS4 are highly conserved in at least 20 plant bZIP60 homologues. bZIP60 and bZIP60N also contain another conserved NLS motif. only bZIP60 U contains the TMD, and the NLSs located at the C-terminus of bZIP60 S have been mentioned previously. bZIP60 without C-terminus (aa 218\u2013258) can heterodimerize with bZIP28. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S showed a strong homo-interaction. both showed a strong homo-interaction, indicated by yeast growth even under higher concentration AbA. data are representative of three repeats. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S were located in the nucleus, co-localized with an NLS-tagged reporter. however, no FRET signal was evident in cells co-transformed with bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60 S-YFP. no significant change in fluorescence intensity of bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60N S-CFP could be observed. bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S can rescue the Virus Suppression Phenotype. bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S can rescue the virus suppression phenotype of the bzip60-2 mutant at 18 dpi after inoculation with buffer or TuMV. both transformants developed typical TuMV symptoms, compared to the wild type and bzip60-2 mutant. no bZIP60 S mRNA was detected in the two ire1a ire1b double mutants. the vanished mRNA in the ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant was restored. the virus suppression phenotype of the ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant could also be rescued by introducing bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S into the double mutant. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S are functionally complementary with HAC1p S in Yeast. both HAC1p and bZIP60 contain a conserved DNA binding domain (BD or bZIP domain) 60 S and bZIP60N S have a functional NLS [45] that is also located upstream of the BD domain. cDNAs encoding HAC1p U, HAC1p S, bZIP60 U, bZIP60 S, bZIP60N S and bZIP60N S were cloned into a yeast expression vector in frame fused to the C-terminus of YFP under the control of a G both bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S are localized to the nucleus in yeast. the amino acid sequence of the bZIP domain is highly conserved between HAC1p and bZIP60. identical residues are highlighted with red, and conserved residues with a conservation threshold of 9 and 8 are shaded with green and blue. bZIP60 is a domain for transcription activation (AD), which results from the unconventional splicing to remove 252 nt. bZIP60 is also present in bZIP60N S (Figs 10A and S8). functional complementation was performed to test whether bZIP60C and bZIP60C could execute the functions of HAC1p in yeast. IP60N U and bZIP60Cs successfully rescued the ER stress phenotype. the bZIP60 S protein with mutated NLS3 and NLS1 failed to rescue the Tm-sensitive phenotype. previous studies have shown that constitutive expression of HAC1p S has an adverse effect on yeast growth under normal conditions. untransformed or transformed yeast cells with CEN-ARS plasmids were switched to galactose-containing medium for induction from OD600 = 0.3. at 10 h post-induction, the cells were normalized to an OD600 = 1.0 and 5-fold serial dilutions were spotted on galactose-containing plates. expression of bZIP60 and bZIP60 inhibits yeast growth. induction of both HAC1 U and HAC1 S leads to retarded growth. bZIP60 Is Spliced in response to viral infection. bZIP60 U was significantly increased at 2.5 dpi in response to TuMV challenge. it returned to the level not significantly different from that in buffer or agrobacterium-inoculated controls at 5.5 dpi. the bZIP60 S was monitored following an approach recently developed by Moreno et al. Actin II was used as an internal control for qRT-PCR. data represent means with SD of three biological replicates. ns, non-significant. the expression of these UPR marker genes was also up-regulated at 6 and 9 dpi in systemically infected leaves. the bZIP60 UPR signaling pathway is indeed activated in both local and systemic leaves in response to TuMV infection. quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that TuMV infection triggered NtbZIP60 splicing in N. benthamiana as expected. of the 11 viral factors, the viral membrane protein 6K2 strongly induced the accumulation of NtbZIP60 S. two independent T-DNA insertion mutants in bZIP60 (bzip60-1, SALK_050203; bzip60-2, SAIL_283_B03) were used. the role of bZIP60 S in viral pathogenesis was examined. bzip60-2 mutant accumulated to similar levels in the wild type and bzip60-1 plants. wild type and bzip60-1 plants inoculated with TuMV. no bZIP60 S was detectable in the bzip60-2 mutant either under or without TuMV attack. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 are non-RNA null mutants. bzip60-2 mutants develop contrasting viral symptoms promoted us to re-examine the molecular characterization of the two mutants. by sequencing the T-DNA flanking regions, we mapped the insertion at position 41 and 1116 nt downstream from the translation initiation codon (ATG1) of bZIP60 genomic DNA in bzip60-1 and bzip60-2. a 23-bp sequence within the second exon to be spliced through unconventional splicing is represented by a red triangle. the new termination codon (TAG798) due to a frame-shift caused by splicing is indicated by a blue triangle. bzip60-1 mutant might produce a shorter version of bZIP60 ORF (bZIP60N) bzip60-2 mutant transcribes incomplete bZIP60 mRNA (bZIP60C) coding for a truncated bZIP60 without the C-terminus. bzip60-1 mutant produces bZIP60N transcripts encoding a shorter version of bZIP60 lacking the N-terminal 50 amino acids (aa) bZIP60C transcript in the bzip60-2 mutant accumulated to a level similar to bZIP60 mRNA in the wild type. bZIP60C expression in the bzip60-2 mutant greatly inhibited bZIP60N expression in the bzip60-1 mutant. bzip60-1 and bzip60-2 seedlings treated with ER stress agents DTT or Tm produced the detectable spliced form of bZIP60 mRNA. the level of bZIP60N S in the bzi60-1 mutant was lower than that of bZIP60 S in the wild type. the bzip60-1 mutant is a bZIP60 expression knockdown mutant. the bzip60-2 mutant is a bZIP60 splicing knockout mutant. the bzip60-2 mutant is a bZIP60 splicing knockout mutant. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S both have functional NLSs. a triple mutation of NLS4, NLS5 and NLS2 did not arrest the localization of bZIP60 S into the nucleus. bZIP60 without C-terminus (aa 218\u2013258) can heterodimerize with bZIP28. bZIP60 without C-terminus (aa 218\u2013258) can heterodimerize with bZIP28. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S showed a strong homo-interaction. data are representative of three repeats. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S both were located in the nucleus. the same results were obtained from co-transformation with bZIP60N S-CFP and NLS-YFP or the reciprocal combination (S12B Fig). however, a strong FRET emission was observed in cells co-expressing bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60N S-YFP proteins or co-expressing bZIP60N S-CFP. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S have the same function as bZIP60 S in TuMV infection. transgenic lines with bZIP60N S or bZIP60N S developed the same typical viral symptoms as the wild type. bzip60-2 mutant at 18 dpi after inoculation with buffer or TuMV. qRT-PCR analysis of TuMV CP mRNA levels. ire1a ire1b double mutants (ire1a-2 ire1b-4 and ire1a-3 ire1b-4) showed typical viral symptoms. ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant could also be rescued by introducing bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S into the double mutant. the virus suppression phenotype of the ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant was also rescued by complementation with IRE1A or IRE1B alone. bZIP60 S and bZIP60 S are functionally complementary with HAC1p S in Yeast. both have a conserved DNA binding domain (BD or bZIP domain) bZIP60 and bZIP60 contain a functional NLS. bZIP60 U, bZIP60 S, bZIP60N U and bZIP60N S were cloned into a yeast expression vector in frame fused to the C-terminus of YFP under the control of a GAL1 inducible promoter. both bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S are localized to the nucleus in yeast. the typical bZIP domain contains basic region and leucine zipper. the NLS shaded in pink in HAC1p, whereas the NLS shaded in black in bZIP60. functional complementation was performed to test whether bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S could execute the functions of HAC1p in yeast. bZIP60C from bzip60-2 mutant also contains AD and BD domains as well as a functional NLS (S8 Fig, NLS3). the yeast cells expressing bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S showed limited growth in the presence of 2% galactose. bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S functions like HAC1p to rescue the ER-stress sensitive phenotype in yeast. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S, not bZIP60 U or bZIP60N U, inhibit yeast growth under normal condition but increases ER stress tolerance. induction of both HAC1 U and HAC1 S leads to retarded growth. bzip60-2 mutant showed anti-biotic stress phenotype, i.e., inhibition of viral infection. the other independent mutant bzip60-1 showed the same susceptible phenotype as wild type plants. bZIP60N S-producing bzip60-1 mutant has long been considered an RNA-null mutant to ascertain the behavior of the UPR, but many confusing findings have been generated. bzip60-1 mutant develops only a modest ER stress phenotype similar to the wild type controls, whereas IRE1A and IRE1B display a marked stress injury [23,28]. the finding of bZIP60N S as a functional derivative of the full-length bzip28-2 mutant raises the question if bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S are the functional homolog of yeast HAC1p [15]. bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S were predominantly concentrated in the nucleus in yeast under DTT treatment. bZIP60 U and bZIP60N U from the nucleus may be attributed to the TMD that anchors the bZIP60 U and bZIP60N U proteins to the ER membrane in yeast. the removal of the small 23-bp intron of bZIP60 U leads to a frame-shift that eliminates the TMD and acquires another functional NLS (NLS1). bZIP60 has the N-terminal, splicing-independent AD (S8 Fig). the two transcriptional activation domains share high sequence similarity. the identification of bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S as homolog of HAC1p was corroborated by the yeast growth assay. IRE1-mediated bZIP60 splicing leads to elimination of the TMD and acquisition of a functionally redundant NLS. bZIP60C in the bzip60-2 mutant is non-functional. the role of IRE1 and its mRNA substrate in viral infection has been explored in mammalian cells. bzip60-1 mutant with up-regulated bZIP60N S developed typical viral symptoms. the other independent mutant bzip60-2 without detectable bZIP60 S significantly inhibited the viral accumulation. bZIP60 S or bZIP60N S could rescue the virus suppression phenotype of the bzip60-2 mutant. IRE1 and bZIP60 were both involved as a matched system in viral pathogenesis. neither the double mutant of IRE1A and IRE1B nor the bzip60-2 mutant could completely prevent viral infection. this result is in accordance with the established conception of the UPR functioning as a buffer or a homeostat to cope with diverse ER stresses. the increased expression of ER-resident chaperones may further facilitate virus infection through direct involvement in virus infection process [66] in the single-celled yeast, the host Ssa1/2p molecular chaperone (yeast homologue of HSP70) is required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase to enhance viral RNA replication [67,68] in plants, HSP70 induced by potyvirus infection is also regulated by the cytoplasmic UPR pathway [69,70] 6K2 is a new member in the group of virus-encoded ER-targeting and UPR-inducing proteins. the mechanism of 6K2 triggering the UPR is yet to be determined. it is possible that 6K2 interacts with IRE1 to activate the UPR. IRE1 and bZIP60 mRNA are a cognate system to determine the viral pathogenesis in arabidopsis. the IRE1p and HAC1 mRNA pathway functions in the simple one-celled eukaryotic organism of yeast as a linear pair during development or stress responses. the IRE1p and bZIP60 mRNA duet manipulates the virus-host interactions in plants. ire1a-2 ire1b-4 bzip28-2 is lethal, caused by a severe defect in male gametophyte. ire1a-2 mutant ire1a-2 ire1b-4 bzip28-2 is lethal, caused by a severe defect in male gametophyte [35] serine-directed protein kinase directly interacts with pro-apoptotic factors, such as BAX and BAK, to contribute to apoptosis in ER-stressed cells. most recently, IRE1 has been shown to selectively degrade microRNAs (miRs -17, -34a, -96, and -125b) [78,79] the bZIP60N S protein in the bzip60-1 mutant bears functional AD and BD domains as well as the intact C-terminus [22,49] bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S both contain two functional NLSs (Figs 5, 6B, S8A, S11 and S12B) like bZIP60 S, bZIP60N S self-interacts to homodimerize. the bzip60-1 mutant develops only a modest ER stress phenotype. the double mutant of IRE1A and IRE1B is lethal. the double mutant of IRE1A and IRE1B is lethal. however, the double mutant of IRE1A and IRE1B is not lethal. bZIP60 U and bZIP60N U were located in the cytoplasm in yeast. exclusion may be attributed to the TMD that anchors the bZIP60 U and bZIP60N U proteins to the ER membrane in yeast. the removal of the small 23-bp intron leads to a frame-shift that eliminates the TMD and acquire another functional NLS (NLS1). bZIP60 has the C-terminal 18-aa AD after IRE1-mediated splicing. bZIP60 has the N-terminal, splicing-independent AD (S8 Fig). bZIP60 has the N-terminal, splicing-independent AD (S8 Fig) a truncated bZIP60 without the large C-terminal region (aa 218\u2013258) is not able to homodimerize with a same truncated bZIP28. the IRE1-mediated bZIP60 splicing also produces a new C-terminal sequence that is essential for bZIP60 S homodimerization to carry out transcriptional regulation. XBP1 S has been viewed as an effective strategy used by mammalian viruses to cope with the IRE1-bZIP60 branch-mediated antiviral responses. bzip60-1 mutant with up-regulated bZIP60N S developed typical viral symptoms and allowed viruses to accumulate at the same level as the wild type. bzip60-2 mutant without detectable bZIP60 S significantly inhibited the viral accumulation and remarkably suppressed disease symptoms. ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant could also be recovered by the introduction of bZIP60 S or bZIP60N. this is the first report showing that the projected cognate system of IRE1 and bZIP60 behaves like a host factor in viral infection in plants. however, the role of IRE1 and bZIP60 S in virus infection in plants apparently contradicts with the function of their counterparts as an resistance mechanism. -bZIP60 pathway-mediated UPR may aim to alleviate cytotoxicity by up-regulating ER molecular chaperons. the increased expression of ER-resident chaperones may further facilitate virus infection through direct involvement in virus infection process. the potyviral 6K2 protein is an integral membrane protein. it elicits the formation of ER-derived virus replication factories at ER exit sites. it is possible that 6K2 induces the UPR through its physical interaction with the ER or subsequent ER remodelling. IRE1p and bZIP60 mRNA have evolved as a matched enzyme-substrate pair to carry out the signal transduction between the ER and nucleus of the UPR. IRE1p and bZIP60 mRNA pathway functions in the simple one-celled eukaryotic organism of yeast as a linear pair during development or stress responses. deletion of either IRE1 or its splicing target XBP1 is synthetically lethal with bZIP60 mRNA is the only known substrate of IRE1A/IRE1B in arabidopsis [22,30,35]. ire1a-2 ire1b-4 bzip28-2 is lethal, caused by a defect in male gametophyte [35]. ire1a-2 ire1b-4 bzip28-2 is lethal, caused by a severe defect in male gametophyte [35]. bZIP60 expression knockdown mutant (bzip60-1) showed normal root growth. IRE1 activates Jun N-terminal kinase, a serine-directed protein kinase, in response to ER stress in embryonic fibroblasts. most recently, IRE1 has been shown to selectively degrade microRNAs. all Arabidopsis plants were grown in a growth chamber with a 14 h photoperiod (100 mol photons m-2 s-1) and a relative humidity of 75% at 23/21\u00b0C (light/dark) the N. benthamiana plants were grown in a growth room with a 16 h photoperiod (80\u2013100 mol photons m-2 s-1) and a relative humidity of 75% at 23/21\u00b0C coding sequences of bZIP60 U, bZIP60 S, bZIP60N S, bZIP60C1, bZIP60C2, IRE1A and IRE1B were amplified using yeast cDNA. coding regions of P1, HC-Pro, P3, 6K1, CI, 6K2, NIaVPg, NIaPro, NIb and CP of TuMV were amplified from the TuMV infectious resulting binary destination vectors were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) the resulting binary destination vectors were re-suspended with the infiltration buffer to OD600 = 0.3, and then infiltrated into the leaves of 3-week-old N. benthamiana seedling. each treatment contains at least three independent plants. three band-pass filters were used for CFP, YFP and MCherry signal collection. entry vectors with cDNAs of bZIP60 S and bZIP60N S were recombined into pGBKT7-GW (bait) and pGADT7-GW (prey) vectors using the LR reaction. two days after transformation, sensitized emission FRET was determined under an inverted confocal microscope (TCS SP2, Leica, Germany). images in donor (excitation 458 nm; emission 465 to 505 nm), acceptor (excitation 514 nm; emission 525 to 600 nm) and FRET (emission 525 to 600 nm) channels were captured. mutant and ire1a-3 ire1b-4 double mutant plants were transformed by the floral-dip method. transgenic lines (T2 generation) were used for complementation assays by IRE1A or IRE1B.

YFP signal was captured in another detection channel using a 514 nm excitation light and a 525\u2013550 nm band-pass filter. the cells were then spun down, washed, and cultured in 2 x SRaf-TRP-URA media for 8 h to relief the glucose repression of Gal1 promoter. x SRaf-TRP-URA plates in presence of 0.1% DMSO. domain and NLS motif predicted using SMART and NucPred. gene sequences can be retrieved under following accession numbers. cDNA and genomic DNA were also PCR analyzed as controls. the 23-bp intron marked with a box is absent in all selected six colonies. the size of PCR products were indicated at right.
