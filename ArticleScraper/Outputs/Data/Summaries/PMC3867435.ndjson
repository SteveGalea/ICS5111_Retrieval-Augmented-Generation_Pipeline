{"summary": "new strain of CHIK, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, in china, a nonindigenous region for CHIK. we performed etiological and phylogenetic analyses to better understand its molecular characterization and phylogenetic pattern. this positive single strand of RNA is 12,017 bp long. CHIK is a potential global threat to public health because it is transmitted by mosquitoes in areas where there are large populations of susceptible human hosts. a sudden outbreak among 173 patients was also reported in Guangdong Province, China, in 2010. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C in a carbon dioxide atmosphere with media changes twice a week. the cultures were checked daily for cytopathic effects (CPEs) the viral RNA was first extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. first PCR run was initial denaturing for 5 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 20 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, 2 min of elongation at 72\u00b0C. second PCR run started with denaturing for 5 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 10 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 65 to 56\u00b0C with 1\u00b0C per cycle for each successive cycle and 1 min 30 s of elongation at 72\u00b0 maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was processed in RAxML v7.2.8 [6], [7]. the optimal ML tree and bootstrap percentages were estimated in the same run using the rapid bootstrap algorithm. a 200 l serum sample from a suspected case of CHIK in china was obtained from the Zhejiang Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau in 2012. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere with media changes twice a week. the RNA was first extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the classic cDNA-AFLP method was enzyme digestion, followed by ligation, nest PCR and clone sequencing. the first PCR run was initial denaturing for 5 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 20 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, 2 min of elongation at 72\u00b0C. the second PCR product was analyzed on agarose gel. DNA fragments from the gel were extracted with the QIAquick get extraction kit (Qiagen) the whole genome of CHIK was assembled and aligned with 154 additional sequences.

Modification steps are indicated with asterisks. results Virus Isolation This was the first suspected case of CHIK in Zhejiang Province. three days after inoculation, virus-induced cellular changes were observed using light microscopy in two cells lines, vero and C6/36. both cell lines showed significant cytopathic effects, including small, round cells, some of which were damaged. chik-sy/2012 was isolated from chik-sy/2012. chik-sy/2012 was isolated with 22 other whole genome sequences. no specific amino acid changes were found in chik-sy/2012. nsP1 nsP2 nsP2 nsP3 nsP3 nsP4 C E2 E2 6K E1 E1 E1 E1 E1 Polypeptide position 120 1074 1112 1167 1705 1727 2044 8 503 577 779 1035 1078 1093 1125 Protein position Q120R L539S G577R N632S D372N M394I P181S T8A R178 twenty-two CHIKV whole-genome sequences were selected for comparison with the imported CHIKVs. three east/central/south African strains were selected for comparison with the imported CHIKV. chik-sy/2012 shared its highest identity with Indonesia/0706aTw/2007. clade II had a more complex phylogenetic pattern, as it split into two sub-clades. clade 1 and 2 possessed 226A in the E1 gene. cytopathic effect (CPE) of cells infected with CHIK 3 days after inoculation in vero. sample concentration comparison Targeted sample concentration usually plays a crucial role in such experiments. two independent open reading frames (ORFs) were embedded. one encodes the non-structural protein nsP1 to nsp4. the other encodes structural proteins, such as C, E3, E2, 6K and E1. no specific amino acid changes were found in chik-sy/2012. 2N M394I P181S T8A R178H K252Q V31I A226V M269V D284E A316V FD080008/2008 Q L G N D I P T H K I A V E A SD08Pan/2008 R L R S N M P T R K V A M E A FD080178/2008 Q S G N D M S A R Q V V V V E V FD080231/2008 Q S IND-00-MH4 (GenBank: NC_004162), IND-06-TN1 (GenBank: EF027139), CHIK31 (GenBank: EU564335), DRDE-06 (GenBank: EF210157), ITA07-RA1 (GenBank: EU244823), Wuerzburg (GenBank: EU037962), D570/06 (GenBank: EF012359), IND-06-RJ1 (Gen the strain detected in clade 1 and 2 possessed 226A in the E1 gene. clade 3 had sequences derived from different areas. the strain was distributed in a different clade from other CHIK viruses found in china previously. CHIK has likely been circulating for years in africa since its origin. it then diverged along two different routes: one to Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia) from the 1950s to 1980s. there was no mutation from Ala to Val in the E1 226 position in our Zhejiang strain. local outbreaks of sporadic strains have arisen according to this geographic pattern. adapted RNA viruses to a new host or vector species often results in the emergence of new viral lineages. genetic variation and isolation allows local strains to evolve independently and to maintain unique genes/alleles as is required for genetic adaptation to local environments. phylogeny of the chikungunya virus This is the first isolation of CHIK. it is the first complete genome sequence of virus strain chik-sy/2012 isolated in 2012 from a patient with CHIK fever in Zhejiang, china. CHIK has been circulating for years in africa since its origin. it diverged along two different routes: one to Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia) from the 1950s to 1980s. the other (Clade II) through the Indian ocean, such as Sri Lanka and la Reunion, to Southeast Asia and then to Europe (Italie) a modified workflow using cDNA-AFLP for virus discovery is needed to further understand, monitor and evaluate the threats to this region. a variety of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms challenge our health, some newly evolved and unknown to date. the cost for virus detection using new generation sequencing methods is still much higher than traditional procedures. clinical samples should be centrifuged and filtrated with filter membrane. clinical samples will be tested through our modified virus discovery method."}
