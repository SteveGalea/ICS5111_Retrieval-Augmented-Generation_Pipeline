{"summary": "the best-known AvCoV is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), causing mainly respiratory disease in chickens. in guinea fowl, coronaviruses were identified for the first time in 2011 as the causative agent for fulminating enteritis (6). mutations in the spike proteins of IBV may result in decreased (10) or increased (12) avidity for its receptor present on epithelial cells of the trachea. recombinant protein binding of their S1 proteins reflects this viral tropism, with predominant staining of epithelial cells of the small intestine. duodena from 29 diseased guinea fowls were collected and analyzed for lesions and coronaviral protein expression. the entire gastrointestinal tract was available for histological analysis, showing lesions across the entire length of the intestinal tract, including the colon. in the colons devoid of expression of viral proteins, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was noted. chitis virus is known to cross-react with GfCoV M protein in immunohistochemistry (IHC) black arrowheads indicate inflammatory cells, white arrowheads indicate viral protein expression. however, we hypothesize genetically divergent GfCoVs may have caused phenotypic differences in guinea fowls over the years. overlapping conventional PCRs were performed with primers based on the spike gene of the virus. % nucleotide identity with GfCoV/2011 S1c 14-002

variation was 0.1 to 8.0%. recombinantly produced GfCoV/2014 S1 and GfCoV/2011 S1. we applied both proteins to diLacNAc-polyacrylic acid conjugates. mutations in S1 did not affect specificity but resulted in significantly higher affinity for this particular receptor. lycan structures with their linear counterparts, either with terminal galactose or two differently linked sialic acid moieties. both GfCoV S1 proteins bind to longer biantennary LacNAc structures (Fig. 4B, structures 3 and 4), including the diLacNAc structure used in the ELISA. glycan binding specificity of guinea fowl S1 proteins shown in Fig. 3. number 1 to 4 represents glycans ending with galactose. numbers 5 to 8 represent glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. sialic acids were less than the binding intensity to glycans with terminal galactose. this difference in preference for galactose-terminal glycans was not observed for GfCoV/2014 S1 since binding levels to glycan structures 3 and 4 were similar in each dilution applied to the array. guinea fowl gastrointestinal tissues express GfCoV glycan receptors. both proteins stained the epithelial cells of almost the entire gastrointestinal tract. u.s. researchers examined the binding patterns of GfCoV S1 proteins to gastrointestinal tissues. lectin binding was completely abolished after pretreatment with AUNA. the treatment effectively cleave off all sialic acids from the host glycans. binding levels of both ECA and SNA were strongly reduced. these results suggest that either a minor amount of receptor is still present or that an additional (glycan) receptor is involved in tissue binding of GfCoV/2014 S1. duodena from 29 diseased guinea fowls were collected and analyzed between 2014 and 2016. genetically divergent GfCoVs may have caused phenotypic differences in guinea fowls over the years. we hypothesize that genetically divergent GfCoVs may have caused phenotypic differences in guinea fowls over the years. % nucleotide

8.0%. fCoV/2011 specifically binds to the diLacNAc glycan receptors (Gal1,4GlcNAc1,3Gal1,4GlcNAc) (4). at similar protein concentrations, GfCoV/2014 S1 showed improved binding to this receptor. mutations in S1 did not affect the specificity but resulted in significantly higher affinity for this particular receptor. the data revealed that both GfCoV S1 proteins bind to longer biantennary LacNAc structures (Fig. 4B, structures 3 and 4) both GfCoV S1 proteins bound to longer linear LacNAc repeats with terminal alpha-2,6 sialic acid (Fig. 4B, structures 9 to 12) but not those capped with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 4C) number 1 to 4 represents glycans ending with galactose, numbers 5 to 8 represent glycans capped with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. numbers 9 to 12 represent glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. GfCoV/2014 S1 has a higher affinity than GfCoV/2011 S1 for all glycans bound on the array. binding levels to glycan structures 3 and 4 and to structures 11 and 12 were similar in each dilution applied to the array. guinea fowl intestinal tissues express GfCoV glycan receptors. both proteins stained the epithelial cells of almost the entire gastrointestinal tract. u.s. researchers examined the binding patterns of GfCoV S1 proteins to gastrointestinal tissues. AUNA and galactosidase cleave off all sialic acids from the host glycans. guinea fowl duodenum and colon tissues were pretreated with AUNA and galactosidase to remove both galactose and sialic acids from the glycans. the sequence diversity between the viral attachment proteins of GfCoV circulating in 2011 and 2014 resulted in differences in receptor binding properties with profound phenotypic consequences. the relationship between these findings and in vivo pathogenesis can only be elucidated in detail, however, when new models to study this virus have been developed. the introduction of novel strains via, for example, trade of birds between farms is impossible due to the lack of archived material. here, we revealed a novel glycan receptor for GfCoV, the first coronavirus that binds N-glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. this is the first coronavirus that binds N-glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid presence has been samples were collected from guinea fowls showing enteritis and concomitant high mortality (>10%) in flocks in five regions in France (Bretagne, Pays de Loire, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes) from February 2014 through November 2016. slides were washed three times in PBS, and viral M protein presence was visualized with aminoethylcarbazole (AEC) the tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with AquaMount (Merck) a one-step real-time RT-PCR targeting the avian coronavirus N gene was carried out to confirm the presence of coronavirus RNA as previously described (13). the expression vector encoding GfCoV/2011 S1 was generated previously (29). recombinant proteins were expressed by transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells with pCD5 expression vectors using polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 1:12 (wt/wt) ratio. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance. the slides were printed in six replicates on glass slides (Nexterion Slide H; Schott Inc.) the tissues were treated per slide with 40 U -galactosidase (-Gal) or 2 mU of neuraminidase (sialidase) from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (AUNA) (Sigma, Germany) in 10 mM potassium acetate and 2.5 mg/ml Triton X-100, pH 4.2, and incubated at 40\u00b0C overnight (O/N) before protein application. paraffin-embedded tissues were sliced at 4 m, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in an ethanol gradient from 100% to 70%. antigen retrieval was carried out in Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0 (preheated), before applying 1% H2O2 in methanol. a one-step real-time RT-PCR targeting the avian coronavirus N gene was carried out. the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using a Revertaid kit. overlapping conventional PCRs were performed to amplify the guinea fowl S gene. cell culture supernatants were harvested after 6 days. the recombinant proteins were purified using Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads. lectins were applied to glycans with terminal galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, or lactose. of the six replicates, the highest and lowest values were removed. of the remaining four replicates, the total signal values were calculated and plotted. biotinylated Erythrina crista-galli lectin or biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin were diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2 g/ml (ECA) or 6 g/ml (SNA) and applied to healthy guinea fowl tissue sections for 30 min."}
