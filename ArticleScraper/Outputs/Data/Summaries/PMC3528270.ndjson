{"summary": "the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the most abundant glycoproteins in the virion. circulating subtypes are usually a consequence of reassortment (antigenic shift) that occurs in animal reservoirs. as of august 2012, more than 600 confirmed cases of infection by H5N1 viruses have been reported to the world health organization (WHO) there is evidence that this lethal outcome rate might be overestimated due to reduced sensitivity of the WHO confirmation criteria, no formal H5N1 confirmation by health providers in rural areas, and subclinical or mild infections [14]. the first steps in the initiation of immune responses involve sensing of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PRRs) in infected cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) this recognition initiates a series of signaling events that result in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, type I IFN, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides. others are located and sense PAMPs in the endosomal compartments. the most abundant macrophage population in the lung is the alveolar macrophages, which express TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR6 at high levels [24,42,43] the most abundant macrophage population in the lung is the alveolar macrophages, which express TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR6 at high levels [24,42,43] avian and human influenza viruses infect different cell types as a consequence of their different receptor specificity. some research works on the evaluation of the cytokine responses in primary HTBE cells, as well as on the role of type-I and type II alveolar pneumocytes in response to human and avian IAV. avian H5N1 IAV subtype Cytokine induction Genes up-regulated Refs. non-immune cells HTBE (non polarized) H5N1 vs H1N1 Higher in H5N1 infected cells IFN-, IP-10, RANTES, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 [46] Primary BECs H5N1 vs H3N2 Attenuated in H5N1 HMVEC (Primary endothelial cells) H5N1 vs H1N1 Higher in H5N1 infected cells IFN-, IL-7, TNF, CCL2 [52] HUVEC (Primary endothelial cells) H5N1 vs H1N1 Higher in H5N1 infected cells IFN-, ISGs [53] HTBE (non polarized) H5N1 Induction IFN-, IFN-1,IFN-, MCP-1 [58] hMDMs H5N1 vs H1N1 Higher in H1N1 infected cells TNF-, IFN-, IFN-1, IP-10 [59] pDCs H5N1 and H1N1 or H3N2 Higher in H5N1 than H1N1/H3N2 infected cells IFN-, TNF- [61] primary human lung micro- h5N1 infected human monocyte derived macrophages induced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cascades in epithelial cells than direct viral infection. this supports the important role of these phagocytic cells in the hyper-induction of cytokines in the lung observed after H5N1 IAV infection. a recent report analyzed and compared the proteome variation induced by H5N1 and H1N1 viruses in hMDM. either blood isolated myeloid DCs or MDDCs can be infected by H5N1 IAV, resulting on the induction of high levels of IFN- and, importantly, leading to cell death. the same study showed that pDCs produce high levels of IFN- in response to H5N1. the mechanisms for lung injury development during acute distress syndrome are no yet well understood. it is known that the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other cytotoxic mediators as a consequence of an acute innate immune response play an important role [77,78,79] HA from human isolates usually binds SA2,6, which are abundant in the human upper respiratory tract. low abundance of SA2,3 in the human respiratory tract is one of the limiting factors for the lack of transmission of avian influenza viruses in humans. the avian or human-like receptor specificity might have an effect in the activation of the pro-inflammatory responses. a study from our group showed that the avian or human-like receptor specificity might have an effect in the activation of the pro-inflammatory responses. the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) is determinant of the HPAIV. the polybasic amino acid sequence in the cleavage site allows post-translational processing of the precursor HA0 to HA1 and HA2. avian viruses with MBCS with MBCS are known to have enhanced virulence. NKp46 interactions with H5 and H1 are insufficient to activate the NKp46-mediated killing [108], suggesting that H5 pathogeneicity might be increased by this lack of ability to activate NK cells. another study showed that infection with pseudotyped particles expressing influenza virus HA induced higher levels of activation that the ones expressing an H1N1 2009 HA. dsRNA binding domain mediates direct interaction with RIG-I, TRIM-25 and PKR, resulting on a dampened antiviral state mediated by those IFN inducible genes (ISGs) and increased viral replication. IAV NS1 has been described to hijack the host translational machinery to enhance viral translation. the avian IAV NS1 increased translation in an in vitro cell-free assay. the same study showed that the H5N1 NS1 presented a stronger poly-adenylation inhibitory capacity (CPSF inhibition) than an NS1 from a human or low pathogenic avian virus. IAV NS1 isolated from humans after 1998 viruses present the amino acids F103/M106. the most represented sequence in avian viruses was ESEV, while the consensus sequence for the human isolates examined was RSKV. NS1 bearing the ESEV PBD sequence interacts with the PDZ motif of a pro-apoptotic protein. NS1 IAV is an innate immunity antagonist, which modulates the immune response in different and complex ways. the role of this protein in enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in infected humans might be related with an early inhibition of the antiviral response. NS1 IAV is an innate immunity antagonist, which modulates the immune response in different and complex ways. recombinant viruses bearing a 1918 H1N1 or an H5N1 IAV PB1 segment are not expressed by all the IAV. PB1-F2 is highly conserved in H5N1 avian influenza viruses [151] and the residue 66S is present in some of the HPAIV [150]. PB1-F2 can also oligomerize to form pores in the mitochondrial membrane. a virulence mechanism for PB1-F2 has been recently identified and characterized. the ability of PB1-F2 to inhibit type I IFN production has been recently identified and characterized. polymerase complex involved in deregulation of antiviral immune response. PB2 bearing lysine in position 627 is considered a virulence determinant in mammals for H5N1 IAV. viruses bearing this residue are more virulent in mice than those with a glutamic acid. the NS1-CPSF30 complex of an H5N1 NS1 lacking the residues F103/M106 allows the inhibition of the post-transcriptional processing of cellular pre-mRNA. it is known that in order to hijack the host transcriptional system, IAV polymerase associates with the host RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which seems to contribute to the inhibition of the cellular gene expression and therefore, of the antiviral response. induction of hypercytokinemia by H5N1 influenza viruses results from an imbalanced immune response. evasion of the innate immunity might have as a consequence increased levels of viral replication, which contributes to increased PAMPs detection and cytokine induction."}
