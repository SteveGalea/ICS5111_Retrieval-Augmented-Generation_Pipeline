{"summary": "ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding event that increases the versatility of gene expression. it is mainly used by eukaryotic RNA viruses (1\u20133). some prokaryotic (4) and mammalian genes are also controlled by ribosomal frameshifting. microRNAs (miRNAs) (14) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have appeared on the scene of post-transcriptional gene regulation (15) siRNAs may be effective in treatment of chronic hepatitis-B virus infection (16), HIV infection (17), cancer (18) and age-related macular degeneration (19). introducing LNA into DNA or RNA oligonucleotides improves affinity for complementary sequences. small RNA oligonucleotides mimic the function of frameshifter pseudoknots or hairpins by redirecting ribosomes into new reading frames. oligonucleotides mimic the function of frameshifter pseudoknots or hairpins by redirecting ribosomes into new reading frames. DNA and LNA/DNA mix-mers were synthesized by Eurogentec. custom oligonucleotides were extracted by phenol/chloroform. ethanol precipitated before use. in vitro translations were carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) the amount of mRNA was 0.025 pmol and different amounts of oligonucleotides (0.025\u201315.625 pmol) were mixed with template for 20 min at room temperature. the analysis was performed on a variable cary 300 spectrophotometer using temperature ramps of 0.25\u00b0C /min during heating and cooling. the absorbance at 260 nm was recorded and normalized to the blank control. oligonucleotides were monitored by the SF reporter construct described earlier (27) DNA and LNA/DNA mix-mers were synthesized by Eurogentec. custom oligonucleotides were extracted by phenol/chloroform. ethanol precipitated before use. in vitro translations were carried out in nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) the amount of mRNA was 0.025 pmol and different amounts of oligonucleotides (0.025\u201315.625 pmol) were mixed with template for 20 min at room temperature. after incubation, 4 l of RRL, 0.01 mM amino acids mixture except methionine. antisense RNA oligonucleotides were found to induce ribosomal frameshifting (27,28), but the optimal number of base pairs has not been addressed yet. the shortest oligonucleotide, RNA6, was not capable of inducing significant levels of frameshifting (Figure 2b), whereas RNA9 induced 3.5% of frameshifting. RNA18, 12, 15, 9 and 6 are antisense RNA oligonucleotides. an amount of 0.05 pmol of SF468 mRNA were mixed with 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, 6.25 and 31.25 pmol of RNA6 and RNA9 oligonucleotides. 3.5%) of inducing frameshift due to lower thermodynamic stability of RNA\u2013DNA duplexes. substituting the 3\u2032-cytosine and guanosine in this DNA oligonucleotide by their LNA analogs increased its frameshift inducing capacity to 8.7%. Increasing the LNA content of this oligonucleotide further did not lead to higher frameshifting. further increase of the LNA content to 6 nt (LD6) did not improve frameshift efficiency. however, LD6 also did not lead to the dramatic decrease. an amount of 31.25 pmol of the indicated oligonucleotides was left at room temperature for 10 min. then loaded on a 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. results demonstrate that LNA modifications indeed enhance the antisense-induced frameshifting efficiency probably due to higher thermodynamic stability and RNA-like structural properties. the position effect of the LNA substitutions could simply be explained by differences in thermodynamic stability of the resulting mRNA/oligonucleotide duplexes. the Tm of the 18RNA/RNA18 duplex was the highest with 82\u00b0C in agreement with its high frameshifting efficiency. the 18RNA/RNA18 duplex had a much lower Tm of 72\u00b0C, which is expected for an RNA/DNA hybrid. antisense RNA oligonucleotides were found to induce ribosomal frameshifting (27,28) the optimal number of base pairs has not been addressed yet. titration with RNA6 and RNA9 oligonucleotides revealed that a 625-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides over mRNA resulted in the highest level of frameshifting. 0.05 pmol of SF468 mRNA were mixed with 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, 6.25 and 31.25 pmol of RNA6 and RNA9 oligonucleotides. mixtures were translated in presence of 35S-methionine and the labeled proteins were examined by 13% SDS\u2013PAGE. cleotide by their LNA analogs increased its frameshift inducing capacity to 8.7%, i.e. as high as an RNA oligonucleotide (8.8%) the efficiency of LNA4 was with 7.7% lower than that of LNA2 and that of LNA6 was a mere 1.1%. the effectiveness of LNA/DNA mix-mers is universal. ucleotide applied in the SF468 construct may be limiting the effective concentration of free LNA/DNA oligonucleotides. the oligonucleotide migrated more slowly indicative of partial dimer formation. the LD series, as predicted, migrated as monomers. the results show that LNA modifications indeed enhance the antisense-induced frameshifting efficiency probably due to higher thermodynamic stability and RNA-like structural properties. this phenomenon appears to be general, at least in our experiments. we designed LNA/DNA mix-mer mutants based on LNA2. the Tm of the 18RNA/RNA18 duplex was the highest with 82\u00b0C. the 18RNA/DNA18 duplex had a much lower Tm of 72\u00b0C. the LNA substituted oligos, all had higher Tms (+4 to +9\u00b0C) than DNA18. maximum levels of frameshifting were obtained with oligonucleotides of 12 nt and more. this is comparable to the stem lengths (S1+S2) of known examples of highly frameshift inducing H-type pseudoknots. oligonucleotides are partly self-complementary and this resulted in the formation of dimers. the optimal number of LNA substitutions to induce the most significant amount of frameshifting is four. LD6 with two additional LNA substitutions did not improve the efficiency. merization behavior of these oligonucleotides accounts for different stimulating activities. the observation that different positions of LNA substitutions induced different levels of ribosomal frameshifting is interesting. a lack of correlation between the extent of pausing and the efficiency of frameshifting by pseudoknots has been observed. a similar global structure can induce very different levels of frameshifting. these data complicate the view on the role of the downstream element. a similar global structure can still induce very different levels of frameshifting."}
