{"summary": "in the study population, an index patient is defined as the SARS case-patient who had the earliest date of fever onset within a household. three of these cases were hospital workers who may have contracted SARS in the hospital setting. the interview occurred at least 14 days after the index patient\u2019s onset of symptoms past 2 days. the study was conducted from April 4, 2003, to June 10, 2003. of the 1,690 probable SARS cases reported in Hong Kong as of may 16, a total of 1,214 (72%) SARS cases had been covered by the study. 140 case households (8.2%) did not have a correct telephone number, 163 (9.6%) could not be contacted after at least 5 different attempts, and 10 (0.6%) were not in Hong Kong or could not communicate in Chinese or English. age (y)b 18\u201330 46.6 46.9 1.00 0.287 31\u201340 15.3 15.3 1.17 (0.68 to 2.01) 41\u201350 16.2 16.3 1.04 (0.60 to 1.81) 51\u201360 10.9 10.7 1.58 (0.90 to 2.76) >61 11.1 10.8 1.65 (0.95 to 2.86) Type of index person.

initial part of the epidemic to 0.9 after March 25 (11). a minimum, marginally significant in the univariate analysis (p 0.10) were conducted to obtain factors independently associated with household attack rates and household member attack rates. the study population comprised all SARS case-patients reported to the department of health on or before may 16, 2003 (n = 1,690), and their household members (including kin, nonkin, and domestic helpers) ents were asked to hand the telephone to the index patient who was most familiar with the household situation to serve as the responder. the interview occurred at least 14 days after the index patient\u2019s onset of symptoms past the maximum incubation period of 10 days. the index patient named by the interviewee was, in fact, the one with the earliest onset of fever, if there were more than one SARS case-patient in the household. close contact between individual household members and the index patient (Table 1). risk factor %
