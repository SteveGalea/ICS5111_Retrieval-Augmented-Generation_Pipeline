{"summary": "ED crowding is associated with decreased quality of care, including delays in critical treatments and increased risks of in-hospital mortality. many hospitals and EDs are unprepared to manage the surge in patient volumes during an infectious respiratory disease outbreak. experts compared and prioritized ED and hospital interventions to mitigate the impact of a surge due to infectious respiratory disease outbreaks with varying patient volume and severity of illness. a secondary objective was to prioritize potential data sources which might trigger the decision to implement ED or hospital-based interventions for each outbreak type. participants included federal organizations (2), state and city health departments (6), corporate and non-profit organizations (2), and academic institutions (24). this study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board with a waiver of consent. presentations were conducted by selected experts summarizing the current state of emergency department and hospital crowding. panelists completed two exercises for which they were assigned to one of two equally sized groups. each group was co-moderated by two subject matter experts to ensure uniform and impartial facilitation of the proceedings. each group was given a list of potential data sources based on those used in the literature, current medical practice, and current surveillance systems. panelists were asked to select the top three data sources that could be useful to ED or hospital leaders to \u201ctrigger\u201d the decision to implement the top-rated interventions to mitigate ED or hospital crowding. the following interventions had the highest priority across all four outbreak scenarios. standardizing ED discharge and admission criteria for patients with respiratory symptoms (4.0), informing patients of the most appropriate setting for care either through a website (4.0) or telephone call center (3.9), and instituting infection control measures including hand sanitizers and masks (4.1) most individual ED-based interventions had higher priority ratings for scenarios with high patient volumes, such as Scenario 2/2009 H1N1 (3.6) and Scenario 4/1918 H1N1 (4.0), versus those with lower patient volumes, such as Scenario 1/Seasonal Influenza (2.0) and Scenario 3/SARS (3.0). ED interventions selected were: (1) establishing an ED annex (1918 H1N1 Scenario), (2) establishing alternate a large-scale infectious respiratory disease outbreak requires advanced medical center planning and response in order to maintain good ED and hospital flow. panelists prioritized interventions in outbreak scenarios with high volume of patient visits, indicating the greatest concern for addressing outbreaks where ED crowding caused by sudden increased patient volume might worsen. most of literature evaluating the impact of interventions evaluates the combined impact of multiple interventions. despite this evidence, this particular input intervention (ED vaccination) was rated lower by this expert panel, suggesting that cost and ease of implementation were important factors. high-volume, high severity outbreak scenario (1918 pandemic), stockpiling equipment, and adding staff were rated as highest priority. this study evaluates the priority of interventions across a variety of potential infectious respiratory disease outbreak scenarios. despite emphasis on infectious respiratory disease surveillance, surveillance tools did not rank in the top three triggers for any of the four included scenarios. despite emphasis on infectious respiratory disease surveillance, surveillance tools did not rank in the top three triggers for any of the four included scenarios. public health surveillance data were not considered as one of the top triggers to operationalize any of the priority measures. study represents the first step in delineating high impact interventions according to hospital service and infectious disease outbreak characteristics."}
