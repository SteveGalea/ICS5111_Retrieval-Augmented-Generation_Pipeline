{"summary": "Background Gene trap insertional mutagenesis was used as a high-throughput approach to discover cellular genes participating in viral infection. cells harboring a disrupted ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10) survived reovirus infection, and subsequently ADAM10 was shown by RNA interference to be important for replication of HIV-1. we have randomly disrupted cellular genes with an insertional mutagen and selected for candidate genes whose inactivation allows cell survival following lytic infection. we reasoned that viruses evolved from common ancestral archetypes might exhibit conserved viral-host protein-protein interactions. ADAM10 is required in NOTCH signaling during embryogenesis. it also shares some functions with ADAM17 in the release of surface bound TNF-, E-cadherin, and other proteins [15-20]. it has been shown that a released intracellular fragment (ICF) of ADAM10 is capable of translocating into the nucleus. treatment of TZM-bl cells with siRNA specific for ADAM10 inhibited HIV-1 replication 90% (n = 4, data not shown) treatment of TZM-bl cells with siRNA specific for ADAM10 inhibited HIV-1 replication 90% (n = 4, data not shown) primary macrophages were transfected with different siRNAs 48 h prior to infection with HIV-SF162. supernatants were collected 7 days after infection and HIV p24 production was measured by ELISA. ADAM10 silencing significantly reduced viral replication in primary human macrophages. siRNA was measured using real time PCR in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. cytotoxicity was assayed using GAPDH coupled to 3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase and measuring ATP. the siRNA transfections resulted in no significant adverse cytotoxic effect (P 0.01). cDNA levels detected at 48 hours post-infection should be reflective of only a single replication cycle. ADAM10 silencing did not affect detection of full length HIV-1 cDNA. viral DNA formation was not detected in cells treated with reverse transcription inhibitor AZT. cDNA was isolated from cells at various time points post-infection. if HIV-1 cDNA enters the nucleus but does not integrate into the host cell chromosome, then the viral cDNA circularizes to form a 2-LTR circle [31,32], which can be quantified using real-time PCR. Tat activity was robust in ERBB2IP control siRNA-transfected and HIV-1 infected, but not transfected (virus only), cells at 72 h post-infection. production of the viral Env and p24 proteins were significantly inhibited between days 4-7 post-infection in primary macrophages following ADAM10 silencing. ADAM10 down-regulation affected viral replication in HIV-NL4-3 infected cells. but not in TZM-bl cells transfected with pNL4-3, a plasmid expressing the full length NL4-3 molecular clone (*P 0.05) down-regulation of ADAM10 had no effect on production of HIV-1 in these cells. a functional ADAM10 metalloprotease is not required for HIV-1 replication. a functional ADAM10 metalloprotease domain is not required for HIV-1 replication. over-expression of wt ADAM10 in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells increased HIV-1 replication. -galactosidase activity was measured 48 h after infection. 0.5 g of DNA plasmid was transfected into U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. cell viability was assessed 24 h after addition of TIMP-1. -secretase is a multi-subunit complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1) and presenilin enhancer protein 2 (PSEN). -secretase contains either the presenilin-1 (P1) or presenilin-2 (P2) isoform. this contributes to the substrate specificity of the enzyme. ADAM15 downregulation significantly reduced HIV-1 replication in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. -galactosidase activity was measured 48 h after infection with HIV-SF162 (**P 0.01) treatment of TZM-bl cells with siRNA specific for ADAM10 inhibited HIV-1 replication 90% (n = 4, data not shown) treatment of TZM-bl cells with siRNA specific for ADAM10 inhibited HIV-1 replication 90% (n = 4, data not shown) supernatants were collected 7 days after infection and HIV p24 production was measured by ELISA. ADAM10 silencing significantly reduced viral replication in primary human macrophages. cytotoxicity was assayed using GAPDH coupled to 3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase and measuring ATP. the siRNA transfections resulted in no significant adverse cytotoxic effect (P 0.01). dose-dependent cell death was observed when cells were treated with chelerythrine, a protein Kinase C inhibitor. ADAM10 silencing persists for one week following siRNA transfection. cDNA levels detected at 48 hours post-infection should be reflective of only a single replication cycle. ADAM10 silencing did not affect detection of full length HIV-1 cDNA. viral DNA formation was not detected in cells treated with reverse transcription inhibitor AZT. cDNA was isolated from cells at various time points post-infection. if HIV-1 cDNA enters the nucleus but does not integrate into the host cell chromosome, then the viral cDNA circularizes to form a 2-LTR circle [31,32], which can be quantified using real-time PCR. western blots revealed that production of the viral Env and p24 proteins were significantly inhibited between days 4-7 post-infection in primary macrophages following ADAM10 silencing. production of the viral Env and p24 proteins were significantly inhibited between days 4-7 post-infection in primary macrophages following ADAM10 silencing. the role of ADAM10 was studied in TZM-bl cells transfected with a plasmid-based molecular clone (pNL4-3) or infected with the corresponding HIV-NL4-3 virus. the plasmid has a 15 kb insert that includes a full-length proviral clone and one to two kb of flanking cellular sequence outside both the 5' and 3' LTR and very efficiently directs HIV a functional ADAM10 metalloprotease domain is not required for HIV-1 replication. over-expression of ADAM10 in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells increased HIV-1 replication. the metalloprotease domain is not functionally required for HIV-1 replication. wt ADAM10 and ADAM10 E384A both increased HIV-1 replication. 0.5 g of DNA plasmid was transfected into U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. -galactosidase activity was measured 48 h after infection. -secretase contains presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1) and presenilin enhancer protein 2 (PSEN). -secretase contains either the presenilin-1 (P1) or presenilin-2 (P2) isoform. this contributes to the substrate specificity of the enzyme. ADAM15 downregulation significantly reduced HIV-1 replication in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. -galactosidase was measured 48 h after infection with HIV-SF162. -galactosidase activity was measured 48 h after infection with HIV-SF162. mutagenesis is a disrupted gene in cells surviving cytolytic reovirus infection. we demonstrated the importance of ADAM10 expression at a post-entry step in HIV-1 replication. we also showed that over-expression of ADAM10 increases HIV-1 replication. a role for ADAM10 during nuclear trafficking is in concert with known cellular roles for this complex protein. the protein has several known extracellular domains, including a metalloprotease domain, an integrin binding domain, and a cysteine rich region. activity has been attributed to the 6 kDa fragment released from the carboxy-terminus. ADAM9 and -15 have been shown to be responsible for releasing the ADAM10 ectodomain. presenilin/-secretase has been shown to be responsible for the proteolytic release of the ADAM10 intracellular domain. ADAM10 cleaves the ADAM10 extracellular domain, followed by cleavage of the ADAM10 intracellular domain (ICD) by -secretase. data presented in this study support model where release of ADAM10 ICD from plasma membrane facilitates HIV-1 replication.
