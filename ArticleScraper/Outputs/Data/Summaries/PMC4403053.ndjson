{"summary": "nanoparticles have a great value as they are rapidly picked up by mononuclear phagocytic cells when administered intravenously. polymers may be used for polymeric NPs preparation, among which PLGA or poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) has a special place. PLGA or poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) has a special place. PLGA copolymers are widely used in pharmaceutical industry and research as a desirable drug carrier. antimicrobial agents loaded PLGA NPs increased drug bioavailability at different levels. rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol encapsulated PLGA NPs where used orally against mycobacterium Tuberculosis. glycyrrhetinic acid has a range of pharmacological properties including calmative, anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. it is shown that GLA can hinder DNA replication and may result in an inhibition in microbial toxins and enzymes production. P. aeruginosa is a gram negative bacterium which is another common cause of nosocomial infections. the antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was further compared with pure GLA against different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. lyophilized nanoparticles were dissolved in deionized water forming the aqueous phase. different ratios of GLA to PLGA were dissolved in acetone at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) the prepared oil phase was added drop wise to the aqueous phase while sonicating using an ultrasonic probe. the entire system was located in an ice bath to avoid any loss of oil phase. capsulation efficiency 5 mg lyophilized NPs were dispersed in 1 mL acetonitrile and were shaken for 30 seconds. 2 mL methanol was then added to the mixture in order to precipitate the polymer. the sample was centrifuged at 21000 rpm for 20 min and the free GLA containing supernatant was separated for further analysis. the entire system was located at 37 \u00b0C in a beaker (250 rpm) after a predetermined period, the old medium was fully removed and fresh medium was replaced each time. 5 mL of the old medium was analyzed by UV spectrophotometry for its GLA content. eight tubes were employed and autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 15 min. samples were then serially diluted in the tubes and 1 mL of inoculums of tested bacterium was introduced into the tubes. MIC was determined as the minimum GLA concentration without any visible bacterial growth (6). mer ratio was 1:4 as it is observed higher polymer concentration is related to a higher encapsulation efficiency. a higher polymer concentration can increase the viscosity of the system and make a barrier towards the free diffusion of drug molecules through the boundary phase of polymeric droplets. the ratio between continuous and dispersed phases may have an effect on the stability and size of nanoparticles. it has been suggested that by increasing the ratio of the oil phase, the external surface energy of oil droplets will be dispersed in a higher volume and results in a lower droplet breakage and subsequently the particle size will be increased. nanoparticles stabilization phase is a very significant step in the process of emulsification. nanoparticles stabilization phase is a very significant step in the process of emulsification. a 0.5% concentration of PVA was used to stabilize the formed nanoparticles. NPs are roughly spherical and have smooth surfaces (Figure 2). NPs size obtained by photon correlation spectroscopy were larger than those observed by SEM which may be related to hydrodynamic diameter of swollen and inflated polymeric NPs in water (32). t30% is the time needed for dissolving 30% of drug. t30% was 2 h and 9 h for NPs with 1:1 and 1:3 drug to polymer ratios. PLGA microparticles drug release is usually controlled by dissolution. the initial burst release level is dependent on the amount of PLGA polymer in NPs samples. the results showed that during the first 10 h, an initial burst release led to an early release of 100%, 55% and 29% of drug from pure GLA. the burst release of GLA may be related to the drug molecules that are poorly entrapped in the polymer matrix. in-vitro antimicrobial activity of GLA loaded PLGA NPs was better than the free drug. it is noteworthy that an enhanced antibacterial activity with antibiotics loaded PLGA NPs has been previously reported. this better antibacterial activity may be attributed to the improved penetration of NPs from biological membranes."}
