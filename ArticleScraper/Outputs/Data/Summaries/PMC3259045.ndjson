{"summary": "all groups of vertebrates are susceptible to Cryptosporidium infection worldwide. this parasite is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, which is characterized by diarrhea in humans and livestock. in humans, the prevalence and severity of infection increase in immunodeficient individuals such as AIDS patients. the most prevalent species were C. parvum in preweaned calves, C. ryanae and C. bovis in postweaned calves and C. andersoni in adult cows [16,17]. the most prevalent species were C. parvum in preweaned calves, C. ryanae and C. bovis in postweaned calves. calves arrived in fattening units at the age of 2 weeks old. they were confined in small groups from four to six animals per pen. sampling was done at the ages of 5 weeks, 15 weeks, and 22 weeks. feces were collected and shipped by a veterinarian. the number of animals is 9 because one calf died between the age of 5 and 15 weeks. a calf is considered to be positive if at least one out of the three samples is positive. an 18S RNA gene fragment was amplified by nested PCR according to Xiao et al., [26]. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. all PCR-negative samples were reprocessed according to manufacturer's instructions. fecal samples were taken from 142 animals exhibiting diarrhea at the age of 5 weeks old. calves arrived in fattening units at the age of 2 weeks old and were confined in small groups from four to six animals per pen. sampling was done at the ages of 5 weeks, 15 weeks, and 22 weeks. a calf is considered to be positive if at least one out of the three samples is positive. the number of animals is 9 because one calf died between the age of 5 and 15 weeks. an 18S RNA gene fragment was amplified by nested PCR. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. all PCR-negative samples were reprocessed. Cryptosporidium prevalence was 47.9% and 42.1%, respectively. in 22-week-old calves, the prevalence decreased to 14.3%. sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers GU124621 to GU124628. for the last positive samples, 37 (27%) had an identical nucleotide sequence with C. bovis (GenBank accession number, AY120911) within these sequences, 34 had 100% identity to the reference deposited in GenBank. only one species was identified in 63.7% (58/91) of the animals analyzed. 35.1% (32/91) excreted only C. parvum, 15.4% (14/91) shed only C. ryanae and 12.1% (11/91) only C. bovis. 2.2% (2/91) of the animals studied were detected to produce C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis. ryanae 1 C. parvum C. bovis 1 C. parvum C. ryanae 1 3 C. parvum C. ryanae 1 3 C. parvum C. ryanae 1 ND* C. parvum ND 3 ND: not determined due to unreadable sequence. alleles identified belong to the IIa family. 100 DQ192506 IIaA16G2R1 2/51 (3.92%) 100 DQ192505 IIaA16G1R1 1/51 (1.96%) 100 DQ192504 IIaA13G1R1 1/51 (1.96%) 100 DQ192502 *Total number of samples (No tot samples) = 51 because 9 C. parvum positive samples gave no readable sequence for the gp60 gene marker. forty-six sequences had 100% identity with the GenBank AF093490 nucleotide sequence, 11 had 100% identity with the AF308600 nucleotide sequence and three had 99% identity compared to both references. for the other positive samples, 39 (28.5%) were identified as C. ryanae. the prevalence of these species in 15-week-old animals increased to 44.1% and 45.7%. this prevalence evolved to 50% and 45% in 22-week-old animals. 2.2% (2/91) of the animals studied were detected to produce C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis. no Cryptosporidium species/genotype per animal 5 weeks 15 weeks 22 weeks. reference strain GQ983359, three samples (5.89%) as subtype IIaA16G3R1 (100% identity with reference strain DQ192506) and two samples (3.92%) as subtype IIaA16G2R1 (100% identity with reference strain DQ192505) gp60 gene subtypes of C. parvum positive samples. all fifteen farms were contaminated with Cryptosporidium. the parasite prevalence on farms ranged from 10% to 100% of the sampled animals. rDNA and gp60 gene analysis is the first in France to include molecular characterization. these results are very similar to data obtained on calves under 30 days of age with 95%, 3.6%, and 1.3% of prevalence of the same species, respectively [39] and in the UK on animals over 3 weeks old with 93% C. parvum, 6% C. bovis, and 2% C. ryanae [40]. this association between the age of the cattle and the Cryptosporidium species identification has been supported by several studies [17,19,21,38,40] but different reports suggest that our data showed that animals can be sequentially infected with C. parvum, C. ryanae and C. bovis as well as C. parvum, C. bovis and C. ryanae. the peak of cryptosporidiosis prevalence in young calves could reflect the immaturity of the immune status. the major detection of C. parvum, a prevalent zoonotic species, in 5-week-old calves was in agreement with the report of Atwill et al., who considered that the contribution of cattle to human cryptosporidiosis is limited to calves under 2 months of age [53] in the region of Brittany, all identified gp60 subtypes belonged to the IIa family. the IIaA16G3R1 determined in 5.9% of our samples was characterized in 4.65% in the Netherlands and 5.8% in England. it is remarkable that subtypes, IIaA16G2R1, IIaA16G1R1 and IIaA13G2R1 were equivalently underrepresented in these three countries. this could suggest that the proportion of a gp60 subtype would not be randomly represented in a population. this study was supported by the Catholic University of Lille through the \"Projet Grande Campagne Ensemble Innovons\" genotyping program."}
