{"summary": "a total of 6 species and 11 subspecies of chimpanzees, apes, and orangutans are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Approximately 60% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic (have a non-human origin) and of these, approximately 70% come from wildlife [2,3] samples from free-ranging central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were collected from the environment. the non-invasive nature of sample collection negated the need for further ethical review. feces were preserved in RNAlater and held at ambient temperature for 130 to 1,679 days. all appropriate export and import permits were received prior to shipment. total nucleic acid was extracted from packed volume of pelleted feces. PCR products of appropriate molecular weight were purified using ExoSAP-IT. products were directly sequenced or subcloned into plasmid vectors. PCR products were directly sequencing (Genewiz; South Plainfield, NJ) and DNA was analyzed using Geneious. phylogenetic analysis Nucleotide sequences were trimmed and aligned against each other and with available sequences in GenBank. the first 25% of a 1,100,000 chain length was discarded as burn-in. four heated chains were run with a sub-sampling frequency of 200. fecal samples from wild western lowland gorillas and central chimpanzees were collected from the environment. a total of 35 reconnaissance walk surveys for fecal collection were conducted between 2006 and 2010 in 13 locations in (n = 1) or to the east (n = 12) of the OKNP. PCR amplification was performed using one or more sets of primers for each target pathogen and the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit for RNA viruses. samples were screened using consensus and/or nested PCR. PCR products were directly sequenced or subcloned into plasmid vectors (TOPO TA cloning kit; Life Technologies; Grand Island, NY, USA) gene barcoding and microsatellite analysis Samples were genotyped through PCR amplification of a 450\u2013500 basepair (bp) D loop region of mitochondrial DNA. the first 25% of a 1,100,000 chain length was discarded as burn-in. the first 25% of a 1,100,000 chain length was discarded as burn-in. four heated chains were run with a sub-sampling frequency of 200. four of 166 samples were of human origin and were eliminated from the study. genetic testing confirmed sample collection from 136 (85.5%) western lowland gorillas and 23 chimpanzees. 57.9% (92 of 159) individual primates were positive for one or more virus. 31.4% (50 of 159) were positive for two or more viruses. RNA viruses may reflect degradation due to suboptimal long-term storage in RNALater. herpesviruses Fecal samples from both chimpanzees and gorillas were positive for at least one herpesvirus. 25.8% (41/159) were positive for at least one herpesvirus, and 12 different herpesviruses, all beta or gammaherpesviruses, were detected. the GgorLCV1 sequence obtained from the chimpanzees was 99.4% identical to sequences obtained from gorillas. Cytomegaloviruses (CMV), a type of betaherpesvirus, were also detected. gorilla and chimpanzee adenoviruses clustered within one of seven adenovirus groups in the HAdV-B, HAdV-C, or HAdV-E clades. a previously unidentified group, SAdVGroupOKNP, was the most common adenovirus group and was detected in 20.1% (32/159) of tested fecal samples. 27.1/28.2/29/46/47, SAdVGroup27.2/28.1/32/41.1/41.2, or SAdVGroup35.1/35.2) were statistically more prevalent in gorillas. adenovirus co-detection was not statistically different among chimpanzees and gorillas. ix analysis comparing the presence of each of the 19 different viruses detected within individuals was performed. in individuals positive for more than one virus, GgorLCV1 and SAdVGroupOKNP was the most common virus combination detected. in the 12 individuals positive for both of these viruses, one was from a chimpanzee and 11 were from gorillas. estimated viral richness for both herpesviruses and adenoviruses was 23. we estimate that we captured 83% (19/23) of the total viruses or viral groups in our study population of chimpanzees and gorillas. we did not test the viral richness of individual ape species because our sample size was small. we calculated the total viral richness in chimpanzees and gorillas associated with the Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae families. we did not detect a significant association between the total amount of nucleic acid recovered and ambient storage time. the probability of virus detection was not uniform across all samples. however, there was no statistically significant negative correlation with viral detection and ambient temperature if we narrowed our samples to those stored between 130 and 750 days. chimpanzees were 99.4% identical to sequences obtained from gorillas. cytomegaloviruses (CMV), a type of betaherpesvirus, were also detected. feces from two chimpanzee and gorilla co-speciation clades contained two different CMVs. adenoviruses clustered within one of seven adenovirus groups in the HAdV-B, HAdV-C, or HAdV-E clades. identified members in five groups were found in both chimpanzees and gorillas. a previously unidentified group, SAdVGroupOKNP, was the most common adenovirus group. adenovirus co-detection, where more than one type of adenovirus was detected, was not statistically different among chimpanzees and gorillas. new AdV sequences are indicated in green for gorillas, and chimpanzees in blue. in individuals positive for more than one virus, GgorLCV1 and SAdVGroupOKNP was the most common virus combination detected (Fig. 3B, dark maroon cell) in the 12 individuals positive for both of these viruses, one was from a chimpanzee and 11 were from gorillas. the estimated viral richness for both herpesviruses and adenoviruses was 23. we estimate that we captured 83% (19/23) of the total viruses or viral groups in our study population of chimpanzees and gorillas. we calculated the total viral richness in chimpanzees and gorillas associated with the Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae families. ICE and Jackknife estimators are shown as orange and grey curves respectively. the horizontal bar shows the number of viruses estimated in the analysis. we did not detect a significant association between the total amount of nucleic acid recovered and ambient storage time. the probability of virus detection was not uniform across all samples. however, there was no statistically significant negative correlation with viral detection and ambient temperature if we narrowed our samples to those stored between 130 and 750 days. our estimation of herpesvirus and adenovirus richness in these two ape populations provides important information about the types of viruses that circulate in these species and this population. this estimate does not apply to the viral richness that could be determined in ape populations elsewhere in the world or in captivity. our study does not address novel viruses that can only be detected using high throughput sequencing methods. previous studies have only detected HAdV-E in chimpanzees, bonobos and humans [21,37]. adenoviruses are thought to co-evolve with their host species and usually do not cross the species barrier. adenoviruses are thought to co-evolve with their host species. human adenovirus account for about 8% of clinically relevant viral disease globally. about 50% of the 52 identified human adenovirus serotypes are known to cause illness. adenovirus infections, such as HAdV-14 (B2) cause respiratory disease and pneumonia. host-virus co-divergence is thought to be the primary mode of herpesvirus evolution, but cross-species transmission events have been known to occur. humans infected with macaque simplex virus (Herpes B virus) can develop severe illness or death [52], and simian CMV has been shown to infect human cells [53,54] co-infections of adenovirus and herpesvirus can worsen symptoms and illness. reactivation of CMV has been suggested to be a factor leading to exacerbation of disease induced by other viral agents. pre-screening of ape feces for these viruses could be used to identify animals with co-infections. continuous monitoring of these endangered species is necessary to understand the expression and outcomes of infection, co-infection, and cross-species transmission.
