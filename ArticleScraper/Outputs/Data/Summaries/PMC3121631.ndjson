{"summary": "public health issues PHEPR messages that provide guidelines and updates. public health agencies need to know that the messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience. results We identified 25 systems or tools for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs. health emergency preparedness and response (PHEPR) involves activities directed at preventing possible emergencies and planning to ensure an adequate response and recovery if an emergency occurs. information contributed by health care providers (HCPs) to public health is aggregated, analyzed and used by public health agencies, in part, to inform early event detection and situational awareness. new york city department of health and mental Hygiene successfully used email and fax to distribute public health broadcast alerts to all emergency departments, commercial and hospital laboratories. effective communication will depend on the type of communication system or tool, the delivery format, and the robustness of the system. most publications concerned with this exchange have stressed the HCP-to-public health component. public health literature is reported to be poorly indexed in bibliographic databases. we included \"grey\" or non-peer-reviewed literature sources [17] to ensure wide coverage of less accessible materials. \"public health\" or \"emergency services\" OR \"emergency preparedness\" or \"emergency planning\" or \"surveillance activity\" or \"emergency response\" Web of Science\u00ae database was used to conduct reference searches of relevant articles. data extracted from the final 31 articles resulted in identification of 25 different systems. one article describing more than one system included a description of the evaluation used with the system. one article reported a causal relationship could be \"inferred\" between dissemination of health advisories and testing. the majority of systems used email (64%) to deliver PHEPR messages. only one tool was designed to provide PHEPR messages to veterinarians. a majority of systems used more than one method (60%) for delivering messages. pop-up found that a causal relationship could be inferred between the alert and a change in HCP behavior. other system evaluations lacked adequate detail to determine the extent of evaluation activities. formative studies, though useful in planning and early development phases of a system, need to be followed up with an evaluation focused on identifying changes in outcome or performance measures. 81% of responding local health departments rated their capacity to disseminate information to HCPs as very good or excellent. only 52% of surveyed physicians and 16% of surveyed pharmacists reported receiving any information about H1N1 from a LHD. a tally of messages disseminated through COCA from 2008-2010 yielded 140 messages each. investigators conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand communication processes between public health agencies, health care organizations, and frontline HCPs during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. they found that HCPs received redundant messages; were challenged to keep up with evolving and tailored messages from multiple organizations. more research needs to be done to further investigate how public health can communicate effectively with HCPs. the authors are using a randomized, community-based trial method to investigate the effectiveness of various message delivery systems for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions DR conceived of and led the search, evaluation and synthesis components. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
