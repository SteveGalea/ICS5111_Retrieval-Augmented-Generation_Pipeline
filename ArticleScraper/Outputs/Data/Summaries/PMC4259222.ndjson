{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects pigs and causes porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) it causes significant morbidity and mortality for neonatal piglets. it was first discovered in England in 1978 (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978 ). it then spread throughout Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. crystal structures of main proteases from human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E; Anand et al., 2003 ), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Anand et al., 2002 ) and SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2003 ; Xue et al., 2007 ) have been solved alone. in this study, we report the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of PEDV main protease in complex with a designed Michael acceptor inhibitor named N3. the coding sequence for PEDV main protease was synthesised and cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12 000g for 50 min at 277 K. supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) for purification of the PEDV main protease. resulting protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. pGEX-6P-1 Expression vector pGEX-6P-1 Expression host E. coli BL21 (DE3) Complete amino-acid sequence of the construct produced GPLGSAGLRKMAQPSGVVEKCIVRVCYGNMALNGLWLGDIVMCPRHVIASSTTSTIDYDYALSVLRLHNFSISSGNVFLGVVSATMRGALLQIKVNQNNVHTPKYTYRTVRPGESFNILACYDGAAAGVYGV the previously reported inhibitor was dissolved in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM as a stock. the protein complex was centrifuged at 12 000g for 10 min and exchanged into a buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT using concentrators. the final protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml1 for crystallization. the crystals were cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 25%(v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.7, 5%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 20% glycerol. the annealing procedure was performed following a previously described protocol. the edge of the frame is at 2.44 resolution. Diffraction spots in the outer resolution shell are indicated by the box. values in parentheses are for the outer shell. Isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. the cultures were induced to express PEDV main protease at 289 K for 16 h. centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS. Typical yields were 5 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture. Typical yields were 5 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture. crystals with typical dimensions of 0.08 0.08 0.05 mm were used for subsequent X-ray diffraction tests and data collection. 2.2. crystallization The purified protein was immediately supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and concentrated to 1 mg ml1 using thermo iCON concentrators. crystals were cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 25%(v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 5%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. the optimized condition consisted of 25\u201329%(v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.5\u20137.9, 5%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. the crystal was left at room temperature to anneal for about 30 s. all intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997. the crystals belonged to space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = 175.3, b = 175.3, c = 58.7. no twinning or pseudo-translational symmetry was detected. the primary sequence of HCoV-229E main protease shows 70% identity to the PEDV main protease. the structure of the main protease may serve as a suitable search model to solve the structure of the PEDV main protease by molecular replacement. further structural and biochemical analysis of the PEDV main protease in complex with the Michael acceptor N3 will lead to better design and optimization of an antiviral against PED. f-70-01608-sup1.pdf (51.3KB, pdf)."}
