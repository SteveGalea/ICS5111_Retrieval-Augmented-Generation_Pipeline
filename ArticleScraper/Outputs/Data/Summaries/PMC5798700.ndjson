{"summary": "in the last 30 years, china experienced high economic growth accompanied by a transition to a more market-oriented economy. the health system of china is also converting from a centrally planned health system to one that is more market oriented. however, the majority of people in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties accessing good-quality and affordable health care. the dartmouth Atlas points out variations of expenditures as possible explanations of high health costs. the dartmouth researchers have also presented simulations that suggest that the cost savings would be huge if high-cost regions could somehow reduce their costs to those of low-cost regions. the theory of welfare maximization under the usual condition of diminishing marginal product suggests that health resources at the margin should be allocated to those areas that are least well-off. sigma convergence occurs when the value of sigma falls over time among different provinces. y i, t + T y i, t = + log y i, t + g X i, t + i, t. Xi,t represents conditional variables including gross domestic product per capita, and population of province i at time t. indicators for the Performance of China\u2019s Health System Indicators are selected to measure health system performance according to donabedian\u2019s typology. the definition and available years of data for each variable are listed in Table 1. maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. the total number of pregnant women is substituted by total number of live births Note. beta convergence refers to a process in which poor regions grow faster than rich ones. in our study, beta convergence would suggest that health care resources and performance had improved faster in poorer provinces than richer provinces in china. in this article, we first estimate the national convergence by calculating the sigma value of 7 health indicators. for 2 structure measures, we also estimate the regional convergence by categorizing China\u2019s 31 provinces into 3 regions: Eastern China, Central China, and Western China. the conception of Eastern China, Western China, and Central China is both geographic and economic. process indicators include outpatient visits, hospital admissions, bed occupancy rate, and average length of stay in hospitals. maternal mortality is an appropriate indicator to be included in the study because it has been the focus of china\u2019s health services system for many years. population data at the provincial level are based on the National Population Census of the People\u2019s Republic of China. the per capita data are calculated based on the actual population of long-term residents and migrants rather than the household registration system that excluded migrants. a large number of migrant workers and their family members who are not registered in the local household registration system are still counted as local residents. from the late 1990s to 2003, all 3 regions experienced a sharp increase in average number of beds. the gap between Eastern China and the other 2 regions widened from the 1980s. bed occupancy rates converged at 7.5% yearly, average LOS in hospitals converged at a rate of 3.9% yearly, maternal mortality rate converged at a rate of 4.9% yearly. beds per 1000 people and physicians per 1000 people only converged at a rate of 1.1% and 1.7% each year. sigma convergence is found in 2 structure indicators, physicians/1000 and beds/1000. results consistent with studies that used Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and the Theil index to describe the geographic distribution of health resources in China. the absence of constant sigma convergence in process and outcome indicators is probably the result of multiple factors. the absence of constant sigma convergence in process and outcome indicators is probably the result of multiple factors. if longitudinal data at the provincial level are available, many broader outcome measures, such as all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence is measured for indicators of structure, process, and outcome of the health system. sigma convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators. it is still uncertain whether real equity has been achieved."}
