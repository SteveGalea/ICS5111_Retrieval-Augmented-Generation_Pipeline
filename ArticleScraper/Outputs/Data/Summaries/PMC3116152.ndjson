{"summary": "the structure of the core capsid of an unusual variant of hepatitis B virus, genotype G (HBV/G) at 14 resolution. the structure reveals surface features not present in the prototype HBV/A genotype. HBV/G is novel in that it has a unique 36-bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon. the nucleocapsid of the prototype HBV (genotype A) has been studied extensively by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. two other diagnostic markers can frequently be detected in the serum of infected patients. the e antigen (HBeAg) is an alternate translation product of the core gene that is cleaved and secreted posttranslationally. a unique 36-bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon results in a 12 amino acid insertion at the N-terminal end of the core protein. HBV/G has two stop codons in the precore region at positions 2 and 28, which prevent the expression of HBeAg [8], suggesting that HBV/G replication requires co-infection with a helper virus of another HBV genotype. gene coding for the HBV/G core protein was amplified, cloned into the pET28b vector. lysates were centrifuged on a 20\u201360% sucrose gradient at 30 000 rpm in a Beckman SW4OTi rotor. two populations of 1887, and 11 568 images of T = 3 and T = 4 capsids, respectively, were analysed. two populations of 1887, and 11 568 images of T = 3 and T = 4 capsids, respectively, were analysed. the contour level of the difference map was selected so that its mass matched the volume of the additional 12 residue N-terminal insert of the HBV/G core structure. the resulting coordinates were modelled in to the difference map density HBV/G structure using the program COOT [19] Specimens were imaged at 200 kV in a FEI Tecnai 20G2 electron microscope equipped with a 4K CCD camera. images were recorded at a magnification of 80 000, (corresponding to 108 240 at the CCD detector, or 1.353 /pixel) a total of 13 455 particles were analysed. resolution of the structure was estimated by plotting the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) against resolution, giving a value of 14 at an FSC of 0.5. the resolution of the HBV/A model 1QGT.pdb determined by X-ray crystallography was then reduced to 14 using the EMAN program 'pdb2mrc' the difference map created shows additional mass around the base of the spikes of the HBV core protomers. the extra mass protrudes from the surface of the core particle and sits beside the capsid pores and not over them. the extra mass is found to be adjacent to the N-terminal residues of the core protein. panel (d) shows the difference map (blue) superimposed over the HBV/A core crystal structure (yellow) in all four panels, a red oval has been superposed over the reconstruction to highlight a single dimer spike in the structures at the base of the spike. the 36-nt core insertion on HBV/G appears to result in less efficient envelopment of mature virions compared to that of HBV/A. a number of these 11 residues have been shown to be essential for envelopment but were nonessential for capsid formation. it is tempting to speculate that the 12 amino acid insertion in HBV/G could be responsible for partially reducing the efficient envelopment of HBV/G. an insertion of 23 amino acids engineered on the N-terminal end of the HBV core protein could prevent core envelopment by membranes containing HBsAg. the additional N-terminal residues in HBV/G could interfere with one or more of the essential contacts that are important for core envelopment. insertion peptide in sera from patients infected with HBV/G could be explored. such testing might help to resolve the issue of whether HBV/G can replicate in vivo in the absence of a helper virus strain."}
