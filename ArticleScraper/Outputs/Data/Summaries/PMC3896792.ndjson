{"summary": "PPR is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane. the disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane. real time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids. the disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. a single report described a real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the M gene for detection of PPRV in clinical samples. however, a highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR has not been established for PPRV detection. a total of 36 field samples, from PPR suspected outbreaks in different areas of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, were analyzed. madras Veterinary College canine distemper virus (CDV) Vaccine strain Nobivac Puppy DP, MV Vaccine strain Serum institute of India LTD, Pune Bluetongue virus (BTV) Vaccine strain Dept. of Vet. Microbiology, Madras Veterinary College Viral RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Viral RNA was extracted from tissue culture supernatant using QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit. the amplified cDNA fragment using primer pair N2F/N2R was expected to be 121 base pairs (bp) in length. RT-PCR was performed on a realplex4 real time PCR machine (Eppendorf, Germany) using SYBR premix Ex Taq. each reaction tube of 20 l contained 10 l Taq DNA Pol 2.0x Master Mix Red. 1 l (10 M) of each primer, 3 l of cDNA and 5 l of nuclease free water. RT-PCR product was cloned into RBC T&A cloning vector. specificity of the developed assay was assessed against viral nucleic acid extracted from a range of animal viruses of clinical and structural relevance to PPRV. sensitivity of the assay was determined by running 10-fold serial dilutions (5.11 107 to 5.11 100 copies/l) of the plasmid standard. infected cell culture fluid containing 105 TCID50/ml viruses was diluted 1: 10 serially by using the two negative nasal swabs as diluent. control virus samples (103 and 104 TCID50/ml titre viruses) were also used for RNA extraction. s used in the study Virus Strain Source Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) AR 87 vaccine strain Dept. of Vet.

GQ452013.1) of PPRV Sungri-96 strain by using Fast PCR software. amplified cDNA fragment was expected to be 121 base pairs (bp) in length. conventional RT-PCR was performed on the cDNA preparations of the PPRV with a primer set of NP3 (5\u2032-TCTCGGAAATC GCCTCACAGACTG-3\u2032) and NP4 (5\u2032-CCTCCTCTCTCCAG AATCT-3\u2032) each reaction tube of 20 l contained 10 l Taq DNA Pol 2.0x Master Mix Red (Biomol, Denmark), 1 l (10 M) of each primer, 3 l of cDNA and 5 Plasmid DNA was recovered from the transformed Escherichia coli BL-21 cells using AxyPrep Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biosciences) the OD value of the plasmid DNA standard concentrations was measured at 260 nm/280 nm on the Thermo Scientific NanoDropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer. the inter-assay variations were measured by testing each dilution in three separate consecutive runs. the mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated separately for each standard DNA dilution based on their Ct values using Microsoft Excel software. specificity Melting peaks analysis on the PCR products of plasmid DNA standard and 10-fold serially diluted tissue culture infected PPR virus showed no primer-dimers and non-specific products. only a single peak was visible in the melting peak chart. the assay also showed specificity as an amplification signal was observed only with PPRV nucleic acid. detection limit and standard curve of real time RT-PCR assay based on plasmid copy number. lower detection limit for SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR was found to be 0.001 TCID50/ml. the conventional RT-PCR assay was able to detect 1 TCID50/ml. the real time RT-PCR assay was 1000 times more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR assay. intra-assay variation DNA copies/l Ct values Mean Ct S.D 5.11 107 10.71 10.77 10.89 10.79 0.09 5.11 106 14.52 14.81 14.75 14.69 0.15 5.11 105 18.70 18.91 18.22 18.61 0.35 5.11 104 21.77 21.75 21.75 21.58 21.70 0.10 5.11 103 25.56 24.45 24.74 24.92 0.58 5.11 102 27.07 27.27 26.89 real time RT-PCR assay detected PPR RNA in 30 (83.3%) samples. only 16 (44.4%) samples were positive by conventional RT-PCR. there were no primer-dimers and non-specific products. only a single peak was visible in the melting peak chart. the assay also exhibited specificity as an amplification signal was observed only with PPRV nucleic acid. Sensitivity of the real time RT-PCR based on serially diluted cell culture grown PPRV. lower detection limit for SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR was found to be 0.001 TCID50/ml. the intra-assay reproducibility of the assay was assessed based on the Ct values obtained from testing DNA standard in triplicates. the calculated SD and CV values were, from 0.17 to 1.15 and from 0.71% to 5.32%, respectively. 103 25.56 24.45 24.74 24.92 0.58 5.11 102 27.07 27.27 26.89 27.08 0.19 5.11 101 30.57 30.74 30.57 30.63 0.10 5.11 10\u00b0 32.52 33.26 32.59 32.79 0.41 b. inter-assay variation DNA copies/l Ct values Mean Ct S.D. only 16 (44.4%) samples were positive by conventional RT-PCR. a two-step RT-PCR assay targeting the N gene of PPRV was developed. the assay maintained linearity over seven orders of magnitude. no primer-dimer or non-specific products; (3) by checking the assay for cross reactivity with a range of animal viruses of clinical and genetic similarities to PPRV. spiking assay showed no inhibition in the spiked negative nasal swabs compared to pure tissue culture virus. authors\u2019 contributions TA: Developed proposal, carried out research and drafted manuscript.
