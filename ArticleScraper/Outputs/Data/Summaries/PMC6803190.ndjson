{"summary": "the respiratory mucosal microecology is composed of different microbial communities in different tissues, structures, and physical environments of the respiratory tract. a change in any component may tip the balance, which may lead to pathophysiological changes in the respiratory tract and ultimately culminate in the occurrence of asthma. NK cells recognize antigens through leukocyte functional-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and adhesion molecule-1 and subsequently release perforin and other cytotoxic factors. Treg cells maintain mucous immune tolerance, while IgA plays a protective role by preventing pathogens from adhering to the epithelium (7). symbiotic bacteria promote the formation and development of the mucous membrane immune barrier, regulate immune responses to pathogens, and maintain homeostasis. symbiotic bacteria promote the formation and development of the mucosal immune barrier, regulate immune responses to pathogens, and maintain homeostasis. symbiotic bacteria promote the formation and development of the mucous membrane immune barrier. epithelial cells are the key components of inflammatory responses and the source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. damaged epithelial cells lead to mucociliary dysfunction and increased mucus viscosity, which prevent pathogen removal and even facilitate invasion into submucosal tissue. microbial exposure, infection, microbial flora composition, and immune cell changes are closely associated with the occurrence of asthma. microbial exposure, infection, microbial diversity, and immune cell changes are closely associated with the occurrence of asthma. the presence of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is different from the respiratory tract of mild asthma patients. viruses also play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. administration of IFN- was shown to restore epithelial cell apoptosis, inhibit viral replication and improve airway epithelial cell repair in patients with asthma (31); (IV) the microorganisms residing in respiratory tract and their metabolites directly or indirectly influence the occurrence of diseases. children who live in a rich microbial environment at an age of 0 or 1 year old have reduced incidences of allergic diseases such as asthma. microorganisms can \u201ceducate\u201d and modulate the microbial community of the respiratory tract, induce a shift in the immune response to Th1 to reduce the inflammatory response, and inhibit the Th2-mediated destructive immune response. microorganisms in the respiratory tract have unique characteristics. the advancement of microecological research generates new approaches for asthma prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."}
