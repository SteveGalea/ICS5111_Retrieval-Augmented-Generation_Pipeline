{"summary": "Previously, EAV PLP2 was identified and characterized by a combination of bioinformatics analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. the crystal structure of EAV PLP2 was determined as a covalent complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor Ub(1\u201375)-3-bromopropylamine (Ub\u20133Br) (38, 39) density about the zinc atom (gray) is a maximum-likelihood weighted 2Fo-Fc map contoured at 1.0. the cysteine nucleophile (Cys270) is covalently linked to Ub via the 3CN linker. a fifth cysteine (Cys344) is located near the zinc ion but does not coordinate with it, consistent with other zinc necklace motifs. expression of PLP2 in Escherichia coli grown in the absence of zinc yielded insoluble protein. the side chain of Cys270 is covalently coupled to the C terminus of Ub via the 3-propylamine (3CN) modification. the most significant matches were to yeast Otu1 (38) and the viral OTU protease from CCHFV (43\u201345) followed by Otubain1 from human (46) and the OTU domain of human DUBA (48) aryotic OTU DUBs remove the Ub-like antiviral protein IFN stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from target proteins. cross-reactivity with ISG15 arises primarily from a unique -hairpin on the Ub-binding surface. the viral enzyme binds the -grasp folds of Ub and the C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG15. EAV PLP2 residue Ile353 forms van der Waals interactions with Ile44, Leu8, and Val70 of Ub. residues Thr312 and Ile313 interact with an additional hydrophobic patch on Ub. we hypothesize mutations could be introduced into this region of the Ub-binding surface without affecting EAV polyprotein cleavage. the zinc finger motif projects directly into the Ile44 patch of Ub. it makes extensive van der Waals interactions with Ile44, Val70, and Leu8. Thr312 and Ile313 are located closer to the active site. replacement of Thr312, Ile313, and Ile353 showed WT levels of nsp2|nsp3 cleavage. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding nsp2-3. expression of FLAG-Ub leads to FLAG-tagged ubiquitination of cellular proteins. HEK293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under control of the IFN- promoter, renilla luciferase, RIG-I(2CARD) and nsp2-3 containing WT or mutant PLP2. results were obtained in three independent experiments. labeled substrates Ub-aminomethylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) or RLRGG-AMC represent the C-terminal peptide motif of Ub. mutants I353W and I353R exhibited 10- and 40-fold reductions in specificity (kcat/Km) toward Ub. nsp2-3 expression using a luciferase-based IFN- promoter activity assay. hek293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under control of the IFN- promoter. renilla luciferase was an endogenous control, constitutively active RIG-I(2CARD) to induce innate immune signaling. the six (combinations of) mutations used in Figs. 3B and 4 were introduced into an EAV full-length cDNA clone. immunofluorescence microscopy subsequently confirmed expression of both nsp2 and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, followed by virus spread to initially untransfected cells. the findings indicated that viruses carrying these (combinations of) mutations were replication competent. western blot analysis showed that cleavage of the nsp2|nsp3 site is hardly affected by these mutations. EAV mutants display similar replication kinetics as WT virus. we infected ELFs with WT or mutant EAV at m.o.i. 5. in this setup, IFN- mRNA levels remained below detection limit. this would allow for IFN-mediated priming of uninfected cells. ELFs were infected with EAV encoding WT or mutant PLP2 at m.o.i. 0.25. at 20 and 24 hpi RNA was isolated for real-time qRT-PCR. asterisks indicate a significant difference relative to WT. idues 261\u2013392; 13.6 kDa) was determined as a covalent complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor Ub(1\u201375)-3-bromopropylamine (Ub\u20133Br) (38, 39) the crystal structure of the complex was determined by a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing experiment using X-ray diffraction data collected over the zinc absorption edge. PLP2 shares a conserved core of two central helices and a four-stranded -sheet with CCHFV OTU and yeast OTU1. the region that is conserved among the enzymes is outlined (dashed box) insertion between positions C1 (Cys319) and C2 (Cys349) appears to extend the stabilizing effect of the zinc finger throughout much of domain II. a fifth cysteine (Cys344) is located near the zinc ion but does not coordinate with it, consistent with other zinc necklace motifs that have been described. structure using the DALI server (41) revealed that its closest structural homologs indeed belong to the OTU superfamily of DUBs. most significant matches were to yeast Otu1 (38) and the viral OTU protease from CCHFV (43\u201345) followed by Otubain1 from human (46) and Caenorhabditis elegans (47) and the OTU domain of human DUBA (48) the hairpin modifies the surface so that the viral enzyme binds the -grasp folds of Ub and the C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG15. the -hairpin is absent in EAV PLP2 and replaced by helix 3 of the zinc finger motif. residues of helix 3 bind to the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub. we hypothesized that mutations could be introduced into this region of the Ub-binding surface that would selectively disrupt PLP2 DUB activity without affecting EAV polyprotein cleavage at the nsp2|nsp3 junction. the nsp2 sequence immediately upstream of the nsp2|nsp3 junction does not adopt a Ub-like fold. mutations Thr312Ala and Ile313Val were combined with changes at position Ile353. mutation to valine was chosen to minimize adverse effects on nsp2|nsp3 cleavage. mutations were introduced into a mammalian expression vector. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding nsp2-3 containing WT or mutant PLP2. expression of FLAG-Ub leads to FLAG-tagged ubiquitination of a wide range of cellular proteins. results were obtained in three independent experiments. nsp2-3 mutants were transfecting mammalian cells with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Ub and nsp2-3 carrying WT or mutant PLP2. expression of WT PLP2 strongly decreased the accumulation of Ub-conjugates, whereas expression of the active site mutant (C270A/H332A) had a negligible effect. mutants I353W and I353R exhibited 10- and 40-fold reductions in specificity (kcat/Km) toward Ub. expression of PLP2 containing additional mutations at Thr312 and Ile313 yielded insoluble protein in E. coli, preventing analysis of these mutants. sp2-3 containing either WT or mutant PLP2 was reduced to 20% on coexpression. 80% of the level of the untreated control was retained on expression of the active site mutant. mutants I353R, I353W, T312A/I313V/I353R, and T312A/I313V/I353W showed inhibition levels similar to that of the active site mutant. we first characterized the replication kinetics of these mutants in a time course experiment in primary equine lung fibroblasts (ELFs), which are likely to maintain an intact innate immune response. the first cycle replication kinetics as determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) measurement of viral genome RNA levels did not notably differ between WT and mutant EAV. qRT-PCR was used to measure levels of mRNAs encoding IFN-, the IFN-stimulated protein MX1 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL8. results were obtained in three independent experiments. innate immune response triggered by EAV on initial infection is very limited. we next infected ELFs with WT or mutant EAV at m.o.i. 0.25, resulting in 20% of cells. expression of IFN-stimulated genes would then result in a more potent response during the second cycle of infection. LP2 DUB activity elicits an enhanced innate immune response. RNA was isolated for real-time qRT-PCR measurement of levels of (A) IFN- mRNA, (B) MX1 mRNA, (C) IL8 mRNA, or (D) EAV genomic RNA. binding surface that is distant from the active site allowed us to inactivate the DUB function of arterivirus PLP2. compared with WT EAV, viruses that lack PLP2 DUB activity induced a significantly enhanced innate immune response in primary equine cells while displaying identical replication kinetics. zinc finger is an integral part of the OTU fold. it plays a central role in binding and positioning the distal Ub molecule on the protease surface. the zinc finger is an integral part of the OTU fold. however, none comprise part of the distal Ub-binding site within the fold. PRRSV infection was estimated to cause annual losses in the order of $500 million in the united states alone (62), and the emergence of highly virulent strains in china is of particular concern (63\u201365). however, inactivation of the PLP2 DUB function may be an important step in the design of improved vaccine candidates. qRT-PCR results support the idea that there is at least some degree of specificity in the inhibition of innate immunity. arteriviruses are not the only virus family harboring proteases with multiple substrate specificities. coVs infect a wide variety of species, including livestock, companion animals and bats. PLpro substrate specificities can be decoupled using similar structure-guided approach. cDNA fragment encoding residues 261\u2013392 of EAV pp1a and an in-frame His6 purification tag were inserted downstream of a Ub fusion partner in the pASK3 vector. uspended in ice-cold lysis buffer with 20 mM 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 7, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and lysed using a french pressure cell [American Instrument Company ( the complex was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 10 mg/mL in mother liquor consisting of 100 mM MES, pH 6.2, 18% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000. crystals were flash-cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen after sweeping them through mother liquor supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. the DUB activity of PLP2 (WT and mutants) was assayed using 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)\u2013labeled versions of Ub (Ub-AMC) and the C-terminal peptide motif of Ub: RLRGG-AMC. the enzymes cleave the AMC label causing a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield of the dye.
