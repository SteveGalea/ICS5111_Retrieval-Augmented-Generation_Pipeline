{"summary": "bioaerosols are known as one of the main transmission routes for infectious diseases (7\u201310) and are responsible for various types of health problems resulting from their inhalation and potential ingestion. bioaerosols contribute to the dispersal of pathogens and other health effects due to occupational exposure (12\u201316) a next-generation sequencing approach offers a thorough picture of the microbial content of a sample, leading to millions of sequences generated from a single sample (18\u201322). applying molecular methods to bioaerosols requires some modification of current protocols for optimum genome recovery. electrostatic samplers can also be used to collect bioaerosols. eluted particles can be analyzed using multiple molecular techniques. environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, and UV radiation, influence the behavior and fate of aerosolized particles. a bioinformatics workflow was used for multivariate analysis, differential abundance, statistical analyses, and taxonomy identification. the aim of this study was to compare the efficiencies of three high-airflow-rate samplers. samples with a lower sequencing depth than the one chosen were excluded from the analyses. the sequencing depth was 50,000 sequences per sample for dairy farm (DF) samples and 10,000 sequences for wastewater treatment (WWT) samples were excluded from the analyses. four indexes were used to measure alpha diversity: Chao1, observed OTUs, Shannon, and Simpson. the higher the number of different OTUs in a sample, the higher the value of the Chao1 index. for Shannon and Simpson, the species richness is combined with the abundance to give one diversity measure. the median and maximum values obtained by the SASS 3100 sampler were higher in all cases. the large standard deviation values obtained in some cases are indicative of an important variation of species richness between the samples taken from the five DFs and the four WWT plants. the bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure was used to compare bacterial communities in the DF samples using fungal OTUs from the internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) regions. a different distance metric was created by creating a distance matrix made up of the calculated distances between pairs of samples. the principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a common visualization tool used for this matter. a dissimilarity matrix is used as an input for ordination calculations and clustering. a dissimilarity matrix is used as an input for ordination calculations. the PCoA was calculated using the weighted UniFrac distance metric on 16S rRNA sequences. samples colored according to the DF visited (DF1 in blue, DF2 in orange, DF3 in red, DF4 in green, and DF5 in purple). separateions were noted in panel a between DF1 (blue), DF2 (orange) and DF5 (purple). sampler used (Coriolis, SASS 2300, or SASS 3100), and (iv) the sampling season (summer or winter) the most obvious grouping is associated with the type of air sampler used (red). a permutational multivariate analysis of variance was applied on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and the UniFrac distance matrix. s based on season resulted in a P value of 0.06. comparisons of groupings based on the WWT visited had a P value of 0.18. comparisons of groupings based on season resulted in a P value of 0.08. in DF samples, these numbers ranged from 0.002 to 0.008 for the electrostatic dry sampler and 0.005 to 0.0003 for the liquid cyclonic samplers. for DF samples, the most striking example in the dry list is Irpex hypnoides. Podospora pleispora was present with a mean count of more than 300 sequences in the samples collected with the liquid cyclonic samplers. taxonomy of OTUs assigned using the UNITE database was analyzed more carefully to establish a relative abundance profile for air samples collected using three high-airflow-rate samplers at five dairy farms. the four most abundant classes had similar relative abundances across the three groups of samples. the class Microbotryomycetes was only detected using the SASS 3100 sampler. three phyla of bacteria represented more than 90% of the taxonomic profile for the three groups of samples, Proteobacteria. aspergillus, Myriangiales, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Bipolaris represented more than 50% of the 20 most abundant fungi collected from DF samples. at WWT plants, 50% of relative abundances of the 20 most abundant bacterial genera collected with the SASS 2300 sampler are different from those collected using the Coriolis and the SASS 3100 samplers. all the taxa in the 20 most abundant genera of the SASS 3100 group were covered by the SASS 3100 group. a large majority of the taxonomic groups were not identified using the SASS 2300 and the Coriolis samplers. the points shown in Fig. 1 (DF) and 2 (WWT) were calculated as follows: 10 values from 10 to 50,000 sequences for DF samples and from 10 to 10,000 sequences for WWT samples were randomly selected. the average number of OTUs observed the standard deviation was calculated for each of the 10 values. the four diversity indexes were used to measure alpha diversity. for Shannon and Simpson indexes, the species richness is combined with the abundance to give one diversity measure. the Simpson index represents the probability of two randomly selected OTUs from the same sample being the same species. comparison of alpha-diversity metrics of observed OTUs (a), Chao1 index (b), Shannon index (c), and Simpson index (d) for bioaerosols collected with three different high-airflow-rate samplers at five dairy farms. microbial community studies seek to compare the diversity between samples (beta) the bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure was used to compare fungal communities in the DF samples using fungal OTUs from the internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) regions. the reason for using a different distance metric was that UniFrac differs from the Bray-Curtis index in that it incorporates information on the phylogeny of the observed species in the samples. distance matrices obtained from Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac indexes are both well suited for PCoA (58, 61) the matrices were transformed to coordinates and plotted using the QIIME principal-coordinates script. figures 5 and 6 show the three principal-coordinate axes capturing more than 64% of the variation in input data from DFs and over 37% of the variation in WWT data. separateion was noted in panel a between DF1 (blue), DF2 (orange) and DF5 (purple) the PCoA was calculated using the weighted UniFrac distance metric on 16S rRNA sequences. a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was applied on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and the UniFrac distance matrix. PERMANOVA divides the dissimilarity matrix according to different potential sources of variation and calculates the statistical significance that a variable has in explaining the differences observed between samples. the statistical test was performed using the group significance QIIME scripts. the test allows the comparison of OTU frequencies in groups of samples and to ascertain whether there are statistically different OTU abundances in different sample groups. bacterial OTUs from the WWT plants had more extreme differential abundances between dry and liquid sampling than did fungal OTUs in dairy farms. for example, Aeromonas veronii had a mean count of 580 sequences across the group of samples collected with the electrostatic dry sampler and fewer than 50 sequences in the samples collected with the liquid cyclonic samplers. air samples were divided into three groups based on the collection device. the four most abundant classes had similar relative abundances across the three groups of samples. the four most abundant classes represented more than 80% of the taxonomic profile, except for SASS 2300 samples. three phyla of bacteria represented more than 90% of the taxonomic profile for the three groups of samples, Proteobacteria. Fusobacteria were only present in the samples collected with the two liquid cyclonic samplers. Verrucomicrobia were only present in the SASS 3100 group. the 20 most abundant genera from each group of samples were considered for the analysis. at WWT plants, 50% of the relative abundances of the 20 most abundant bacterial genera collected with the SASS 2300 sampler are different from those collected using the Coriolis and the SASS 3100 samplers. 5% of the top 20 taxa of the coriolis and SASS 3100 groups were identified using the SASS 2300 and the coriolis samplers. the analysis was performed in only the 20 most abundant genera in each group of samples. -rate samplers used for this study provided samples with adequate concentrations for use with Illumina MiSeq technology. the aerodynamic diameter of particles in wastewater treatment plants is around 5 m (73) and from 2 m to 10 m in agricultural settings (74). the source of the bioaerosols seems to have more impact on the fungal communities of the samples than the type of sampler used to collect them. at dairy farms, the main source of variation was associated with the type of cattle feed used. however, groupings of air samples collected from wastewater treatment plants did not correlate with the source. fewer samples were collected with the SASS 2300 sampler than with the SASS 3100 and Coriolis samplers. fewer samples were collected with the SASS 2300 sampler than with the SASS 3100. substantial differences in fungal and bacterial OTU abundances between dry and liquid sampling were revealed. this may be linked to the collection method of each type of sampler. hydrophobic microorganisms or hydrophobic particles carrying microorganisms that are more easily subject to evaporation may contribute to dysbiosis observed between liquid and dry sampling groups. the filter used with the SASS 3100 sampler has a larger pressure drop (5%) than most commonly used filters. the extraction efficiency is constant as long as the extraction liquid exceeds 4 ml. the use of liquid versus solid particles also affects sampling efficiency. using molecular methods on nonviable DNA containing particles not amenable to collection by liquid impingement enables us to have a larger view of the microbial content of an aerosol sample. so, a direct link between aerosol content and the surrounding sources leads to a better evaluation of air contamination. qPCR can be applied to calculate the concentration per cubic meter of air of a specific genus. the visited facilities were all located in the province of Quebec (Canada) Tables 1 and 2 present a description of the sampling sites in each environment. a more information may be found in reference 72. five dairy farms were visited during the summer (May to June) in each farm, indoor sampling sites were chosen based on where activities that generated the most bioaerosols were located. the specific location of each site was also influenced by its distance from the nearest ventilation system. three high-airflow samplers were compared in this study. a liquid cyclonic impactor, Coriolis; a liquid impingement/wetted-wall sampler, SASS 2300 (Research International), and a dry/electrostatic filter, SASS 3100 (Research International) samples collected with the coriolis sampler were collected in triplicate for each site at a flow rate of 300 LPM, for a total of 10 min. each replicate represents three cubic meters of air collected. sampler was used at 300 LPM for 33.3 min in order to collect 10 cubic meters of air at each site sampled. each sample was represented by the 5 ml of extraction and collection liquid. aliquot of 1.5 ml of the sampler is 80%. two replicates for each site sampled with the Coriolis sampler were pooled. from those 30 ml, a 1.5-ml aliquot was taken from the 5 ml of extraction fluid from the SASS 3100 sampler. the pellets were kept at 20\u00b0C until the DNA extraction. initial denaturation started at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 10 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. the quality of the purified PCR product was checked on a 1% agarose gel. cycling for the second PCR was identical to that for the first PCR but with 12 cycles. amplification of the 16S V6-V8 region was performed using a dual-indexed PCR approach specifically designed for Illumina instruments. each reaction mixture consisted of 1 Q5

was also influenced by its distance from the nearest ventilation system. three high-airflow samplers were compared in this study. they were placed within 1 to 2 m of the source and at a defined distance from each other. air is aspirated and drawn into the cone, forming a vortex where particles are. the coriolis sampler has a cutoff size of 0.5 m for an operation flow of 300 liters/min. 0.5-m particles are sampled at 50% efficiency and larger particles are sampled at a higher efficiency. each replicate represents three cubic meters of air collected. 0.5- to 5-m particles is approximately 92%, at an airflow rate of 120 LPM. at the maximum airflow rate, the collection efficiency for the same particle size range is 80%. however, the overall capture rate is much higher at a higher airflow. an aliquot of 1.5 ml of the liquid containing the pulverized filter particles was used for the first step of the DNA extraction kit. two replicates for each site sampled with the Coriolis
