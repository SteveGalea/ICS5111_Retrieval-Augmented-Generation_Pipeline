{"summary": "peptides without linkers between the protein and lipid component are less potent than those with a 4 polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker in the intervening region6,8. we investigated the impact of the peptide orientation, as well as the influence of the PEG linker length, on the peptide antiviral efficacy. the peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKAKSDLEESKEWIRRSNGKLDSI-GSGSG-C of HPIV3 F with a GSGSG spacer and C for thioether reaction) the peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKAKSDLEESKEWIRRSNGKLDSI-GSGSG-C of the impact of the orientation of the peptide\u2019s sequence on its ability to block cell-cell fusion was explored. only C-terminally conjugated peptides blocked the fusion with high efficacy in the presence of the PEG linkers. lipid-conjugated peptides interact with uncleaved HPIV3 F. the peptides bind to their corresponding HRN domains only when they are exposed by the unfolding of F. the uncleaved F has enough flexibility to unfold and expose the HRN domain. 293T cells co-expressing HPIV3 HN and unprocessed F (csm) were allowed to interact with receptor-bearing RBCs at 4 \u00b0C, then transferred to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of either C-terminally or N-terminally conjugated peptides (1 M) the unconjugated VG and the N-terminally conjugated Chol-VG peptides failed to bind the HRC of uncleaved F in a manner sufficient to \u201cbridge\u201d the F-expressing cells. 80% of the RBCs were free and 20% were reversibly bound (attached only by HN-receptor engagement) in their presence. aggregation and lipid-binding properties of VG peptides were assessed based on intrinsic fluorescence of their tryptophan (Trp) residues. the fluorescence excitation spectra of VG peptides in buffer nearly overlap that of free Trp. VG-Chol, VG-PEG4-Chol and VG-PEG24-Chol were compared in order to test the PEG spacer\u2019 effect on peptide aggregation. the longer the PEG spacer the lower the aggregation observed. the longer the PEG spacer the lower the aggregation observed. increasing concentrations of VG peptides led to an increase on the surface pressure, until a plateau of peptide saturation on the monolayer is reached. these data allow the use of equation (1) to calculate the dissociation constant, Kd. a similar kinetic behavior was observed for a mixture of POPC with 33% of cholesterol. the cholesterol-tagged peptides were incubated with the VG peptides during 1 h. the VG peptide and the control DMSO did not cause any change on the membrane dipole potential sensed by di-8-ANEPPS. VG series peptides were incubated in the absence or presence (+) of trypsin. lipid conjugation decreased protease degradation at 0\u00b0. panel C shows that even at 37\u00b0 the peptides with N-terminal tags are not degraded. toxicity of VG-PEG24-Chol on cells appears only when we reach a concentration of 1000 nM (10,000 The IC90); toxicity of the other peptides in the series was even lower. none of these peptides were inhibitory for HPIV3 clinical isolates (CI) and NiV. vero cell monolayers were infected with wild type NiV at an m.o.i. of 2.5 103 in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptides. after 1 h incubation, cells were overlaid with methylcellulose, and plaques were counted after 96 h. VG-PEG4-Chol, Chol-PEG4-VG, and VG-PEG24-Chol were compared for their ability to inhibit infection in HAE at 10 M concentration. a single dose of 10 M of VG-PEG4-VG decreased the viral titer of HPIV3 by approximately two logs at day 2 after infection. however, both Chol-PEG4-VG and VG-PEG4-Chol showed only partial inhibition. no peptide was detected in the urine, suggesting the peptide is not eliminated intact. immunohistofluorescence showed that peptide is present in brain parenchyma 24 h after administration, confirming its ability to reach the CNS. cotton rats received 2 s.q. injections of VG-PEG24-Chol peptide/day from day 1 to day 2 post intranasal infection with HPIV3. animals were euthanized after 3 days and virus titers were determined from lung homogenates in plaque assays. peptide with the longest spacer tested \u2013 PEG24 \u2013 showed the highest potency in this assay for both NiV and HPiV3 glycoproteins. the peptide with the longest spacer tested \u2013 PEG24 \u2013showed the highest potency in this assay for both viral glycoproteins. say was used to quantify fusion in the presence of N-terminally versus C-terminally conjugated peptides. the impact of the orientation of the peptide\u2019s sequence on its ability to block cell-cell fusion was explored. peptides are attached to red blood cell membranes via their cholesterol tails. the adherence occurs only via a peptide \u201cbridge\u201d formed when the peptide that is anchored to the RBC via its lipid tail also interacts with the HRN sequence of F expressed on the transfected cells. 80% of the RBCs were free, reversibly bound by HN-receptor interaction. 20% were reversibly bound (attached only by HN-receptor engagement) zanamivir added to disengage HN from its receptor after 1 h. VG-PEG4-Chol showed the most effective bridging, more than 50% irreversible retention, while the peptide that was most effective at inhibiting fusion inhibition, VG-PEG24-Chol. the aggregation and lipid-binding properties of VG peptides in buffer nearly overlap that of free Trp spectrum. a blue-shift in the maximum emission peak is observed. the untagged peptide VG was unable to form aggregates. this is indicative that all cholesterol-tagged peptides form aggregates. VG-PEG4-Chol and VG-PEG24-Chol were compared to VG-PEG24-Chol. the longer the PEG spacer the lower the aggregation observed. this variation is more evident upon comparing VG-Chol with VG-PEG24-Chol. a similar kinetic behavior was observed for a mixture of POPC with 33% of cholesterol. this represents more ordered domains and the membranes of some cells with high cholesterol content. a similar kinetic behavior was observed for a mixture of POPC with 33% of cholesterol. VG-PEG24-Chol showed a higher affinity (Kd = 0.33 M) in comparison with VG-Chol (Kd = 0.54 M) and VG-PEG4-Chol (Kd = 0.44 M) the dependence of the ratio R on VG (black), VG-Chol (blue), VG-PEG4-Chol (orange) and VGPEG24-Chol (green) concentrations for RBCs was assessed by di-8- panel C shows that even at 37\u00b0 the peptides with N-terminal tags are not degraded. the indicated peptides were incubated in the absence () or presence (+) of trypsin, at 0.025 g/l for 1 hr at 0 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. es in this series, we chose this peptide for an experiment designed to assess specificity of inhibition. we compared the antiviral effect of VG-PEG24-Chol to PEG24-Chol conjugated peptides that are effective against measles, influenza virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. none of these peptides were inhibitory for HPIV3. vs. HPIV3 CC50 (nM)a IC90 (nM)b IC50 (nM)b VG >10,000 280 247 1 VG-Chol 10,000 0.7 0.26 0.015 0.07 VG-PEG4-Chol 4,500 0.7 0.007 0.03 0.04 VG-PEG24-Chol 1,300 0.1 0.0003 0.007 0.007 Chol-VG 9,000 >9,000 HRCMV PEG 24 Chol a single dose of 10 M of VG-PEG4-Chol decreased the viral titer of HPIV3 by approximately two logs at day 2 after infection and approximately one log at day 5. when the inhibitors were given in a single dose of 1 M, VG-PEG24-Chol resulted in complete inhibition of infection. however, both Chol-PEG4-VG and VG-PEG4-Chol showed only partial inhibition. hamsters were injected with 2 mg/kg of VG-PEG24-Chol peptide intraperitoneally (i.p.) at indicated times the animals were sacrificed and the peptide concentrations in plasma, lung, and brain were quantitated. the ordinate values are means (s.d.) of results from three animals. peptide identified as bearing optimal biophysical properties for in vitro inhibition is promising as an inhibitor of infection. cotton rats received 2 s.q. injections of cholesterol-tagged VG-PEG24-Chol peptide/day from day 1 to day 2 post intranasal infection with HPIV3. incorporating PEG24 on the VG series peptides partially decreases aggregation. a longer PEG linker promoted a faster kinetic towards lipid monolayers. a higher affinity for RBCs membrane was observed for VG-PEG24-Chol. a long PEG linker is expected to cause the peptides to be more exposed to the aqueous environment15,16, and more sensitive to protease degradation. this could potentially explain why the level of VG-PEG24-Chol in the brain and serum is relatively low compared to previous data for other peptides6,19. the antiviral strategy on the peptides with lipid conjugated to the C-terminus has been studied for both Ebola21 and Newcastle Disease virus23. in our case, the linker between N-terminal cholesterol and peptide significantly enhances anti-HPIV3 potency, while abrogating broad-spectrum antiviral activity. the mechanistic basis for the negative effect on inhibition of NiV remains to be explored. the pre-insertion F protein is shown in Fig. 11 as extended into a transient intermediate in panel a; panels b, c, and d depict the C-terminally conjugated VG-Chol peptides with each linker length interacting with this pre-insertion step in fusion. the peptide with a PEG-24 linker (Fig. 11d,e) has been shown to be the most effective inhibitor but to less potently capture early intermediates of F activ the panels show the interaction of each cholesterol-tagged peptide with the uncleaved HPIV3 F molecule. VG-Chol without PEG linker is misaligned with the HRN domain of F. the longer linker may permit HRN interaction when inserted in cis on the viral membrane. lipid moieties enhance half-life in vivo in vivo. addition of PEG linkers confers protease sensitivity. this issue may be mitigated by measures including N-terminal conjugation. dotyped viruses were generated using VSV-G-RFP. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding VSV-G or NiVF/G. supernatant fluid containing pseudotyped virus was collected 18 h post-infection. fusion is quantified on a microplate reader (Spectramax M5) in the overnight fusion assay. cells expressing both alpha and omega peptides of \u00df-Gal were co-cultured for up to 20 h. minidase 40 mU/ml and cyclohexamide 1:1000 (100 g/L), for 1 h, at 37 \u00b0C. cells were washed and incubated with 1% RBC suspensions in CO2 independent medium. peptide was added at a final concentration of 2 mM, and plates were left at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.
