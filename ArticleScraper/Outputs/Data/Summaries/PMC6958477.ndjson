{"summary": "progress has been slow since the revision of the IHR in 2005 [1], which came into force on 15 June 2007, and called for strengthened surveillance for all events that constitute a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d there is mandatory notification for four diseases with the ability to cause serious public health impacts and to spread internationally. the emergence of the novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 strain in April 2009 has highlighted the need to better understand the epidemiology of influenza viruses. global influenza-associated respiratory deaths are estimated to affect between 291,243\u2013645,832 individuals (40\u201388 per 100,000) annually. the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to account for some 201,200 respiratory deaths (range 105,700\u2013395,600). laboratory surveillance data can assist seasonal influenza awareness programs, associated influenza immunisation in at-risk groups, and antiviral drug stocking. laboratory surveillance is also used to determine levels of antiviral drug resistance that are prevailing in circulating influenza viruses and potential pandemic viruses. the world health organisation (WHO) is one of five such Collaborating centres. flu ID website links and displays regional influenza epidemiological data. both Australia and new Zealand contribute to fluNet. all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases are reported to the NNDSS database [13], which collects information on location (postcode) sample date, age, sex, influenza type, and subtype. this data is supplemented by the nationwide general practitioner (GP) influenza surveillance network ASPREN (Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network) [14] which records influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community. the main document for the management of influenza pandemics in australia was revised in September 2014. the national influenza surveillance program includes acute respiratory illness surveillance in selected clinical settings to extend the knowledge base of the burden of respiratory disease and provide a robust system for pandemic preparedness. VE estimations to be made for general practice attendance and hospital admission each year. national recording of excess mortality for pneumonia and influenza is reported weekly. new Zealand was the first country in the southern hemisphere to report the importation of the influenza A(H1N1) pdm 2009 virus following the return of a group of high school students from Mexico. primary care response plan includes defined influenza season triggers for primary response escalation, streaming of ILI patients to pre-designated clinics, advice for community nursing, aged-care and long-term care facilities, telephone triaging, and ambulance services. the primary objective of this plan is to optimise the use of community health care resources to protect secondary care services. other countries, like china, have taken a more pro-active approach by setting up clinics for cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause. to strengthen community influenza awareness initiatives is pivotal for successful pandemic preparedness and during a pandemic as it moves to each and every individual country."}
