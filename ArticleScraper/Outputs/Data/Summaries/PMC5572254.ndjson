{"summary": "most have been respiratory viral diseases \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003), avian influenza in humans (2005), A(H1N1) pandemic influenza (2009), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). the most recent infectious disease emergency would involve a vector-borne virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), causing congenital malformations. emergence of new pathogens has been the reality and a prominent feature of the 21st century. it constitutes a global challenge to public health, especially in developing countries. it is not the direct effect that ZIKV has on those infected. a number of serological studies in the 1950s provided some evidence that ZIKV was widespread throughout Asia. the presence of ZIKV in Asia was confirmed in 1969 when the virus was isolated from an Aedes aegypti mosquito in Malaysia. the presence of ZIKV in Asia was confirmed in 1969 when the virus was isolated from an Aedes aegypti mosquito in Malaysia. the absence of any evidence that viral mutation could explain changes in the epidemiological behavior of the virus has led to several other explanations being postulated. the absence of any evidence that viral mutation could explain changes in the epidemiological behavior of the virus has led to several other explanations being postulated. in 2016, 48 countries and territories in the Americas had reported more than 532,000 suspected cases of Zika. in addition, 22 countries and territories reported 2,439 cases of a congenital syndrome associated with Zika. a very rapid dispersion of ZIKV was identified in the northeast region. underreporting of cases would be particularly marked if they occur in areas that are not considered to be at risk for ZIKV disease. the global emergence of certain arboviruses, such as ZIKV, indicates the importance of such diseases to epidemiology and public health. ZIKV has been classified into the Spondweni serogroup, genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae), which includes two species: ZIKV and Spondweni virus. further molecular classifications confirmed these relationships between both species (Figure 2). these lineages correspond to the African lineage, the Asian lineage (that includes the American strains) and a neglected lineage circulating in Africa (designated African II) the phylogenetic tree was based on the sequence of NS5. multiple alignment was performed using MUSCLE and Phylogeny.fr. the tree was constructed by the Maximum Likelihood method. a single open reading frame encodes both structural (C-prM/M and E) and non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) the monomers are colored in blue, orange and green to facilitate the interpretation of their distribution. the E protein is N-glycosylated at Asn 154 in most ZIKV strains. the cleavage of prM into M protein promotes the maturation of the virions from \u201cspiky\u201d immature particles to \u201csmooth\u201d mature particles. NS1 protein participates in flaviviral replication and exhibits immunomodulatory activities. NS3 is a trypsin-like serine protease involved in polyprotein processing. it also exhibits helicase activity, which plays a pivotal role in viral RNA replication enabling RNA unwinding. NS2B acts as a cofactor necessary for the activity of this protein. the analysis of the structure of the methyltransferase domain of NS5 also provides new opportunities for the design of antiviral compounds. NS5 from ZIKV also contributes to viral multiplication by inhibiting interferon signaling. outer layer of viral particles consists of an icosahedral protein shell. outer shell exhibits the characteristic herringbone structure in the virion. the ectodomain of the E protein that protrudes from the lipid bilayer is organized in three different domains: DI, DII, and DIII. ZIKV has been classified into the Spondweni serogroup, genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae), which includes two species: ZIKV and Spondweni virus. further molecular classifications confirmed these relationships between both species. these lineages correspond to the African lineage, the Asian lineage (that includes the American strains) and a neglected lineage circulating in Africa (designated African II) the phylogenetic tree was based on the sequence of NS5. multiple alignment was performed using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and the tree was constructed by the Maximum Likelihood method. single open reading frame encodes both structural (C-prM/M and E) and non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) image was produced using the cryo-electron microscopy data available. the E protein is N-glycosylated at Asn 154 in most ZIKV strains. the cleavage of prM into M protein promotes the maturation of the virions from \u201cspiky\u201d immature particles to \u201csmooth\u201d mature particles. NS1 protein participates in flaviviral replication and exhibits immunomodulatory activities. NS3 is a trypsin-like serine protease involved in polyprotein processing. it also exhibits helicase activity, which plays a pivotal role in viral RNA replication enabling RNA unwinding. NS2B acts as a cofactor necessary for the activity of this protein. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is in charge of genome replication constituting a major target for antiviral design. the analysis of the structure of the methyltransferase domain of NS5 also provides new opportunities for the design of antiviral compounds. the outer layer of the viral particles consists of an icosahedral protein shell basically composed of the E protein. the outer shell exhibits the characteristic herringbone structure in the virion similar to that of other flaviviruses. DI acts as a bridge between DI, DII, and DIII. the unique pathobiology of ZIKV may be only the cause of its thermal stability (Goo et al., 2016). the sylvatic Aedes africanus was isolated from a sentinel allocthonous monkey in 1948; just 1 year later the sylvatic Aedes africanus was found infected. e. albopictus were identified as vectors during the outbreak in brazil. e. albopictus had already been demonstrated competent for ZIKV in 1956. it was incriminated in the french polynesia and Indonesia outbreaks and retrospectively in Africa. the results showed arguments that support (Franca et al., 2016; Guedes et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016) or reject (Aliota et al., 2016b; Amraoui et al., 2016; Boccolini et al., 2016; Fernandes et al., 2016; Hall-Mendelin et al., 2016; Huang Y.J. databases and maps of current or forecasted distribution were developed as a proxy of risk maps for ZIKV or Aedes-borne arbovirus. the modeling of simulated risk is usually driven by temperature, precipitation, elevation, land cover and modulated by variables as seasonal or year-round abundance and density (population dynamics), vector biting and mortality rates. biological topics, as vector competence of local vectors, can change probability and magnitude of transmission. anthropogenic factors usually trigger actual epidemics, even through climatic extreme events. some modeling in border areas includes also travel between borders and socioeconomic factors. drivers of non-vectorial transmission still need better epidemiological elucidation. infectious ZIKV particles have been isolated from breast milk of 1 mother. other reported forms of non-vectorial transmission include non-sexual person-to-person contact. out of Africa, Ae. hensillii was incriminated in the Yap Island as the prevalent species during the outbreak. in French Polynesia Ae. polynesium probably contributes to the transmission. the scenario of potential worldwide spread of ZIKV changed radically. species that belong to genera other than Aedes as Culex perfuscus, Anopheles coustani, An. gambiae s.l., Mansonia uniformis were found infected with ZIKV in africa. but the isolations only prove that these mosquitoes recently fed on a viremic vertebrate. so many experiments on competence were performed in alternative vectors, mostly with Cx pipiens and Cx quinquefas the last concept attempts to explain the likelihood of effective human-vector contact and transmission. it depends not only on innate vector characteristics but also on local density, host range, and blood feeding behavior. even the presence of Ae aegypti does not confirm this species as the primary vector. an undescribed sylvatic cycle in Asia should not be discarded. the Latin America outbreak was explained by 2015\u20132016 \u2018El Nio-Oscillation South\u2019 2015\u20132015 at continental level, but also at sub-regional level in Brazil it was explained by year to year variability. biological topics, as vector competence of local vectors (Gardner et al., 2016), vector competence between species (Camara et al., 2016), and timing and location of vector or virus introduction (Robert et al., 2016), can change the probability ZIKV RNA has been detected in female genital tract samples beyond viremia. it became undetectable around 3 weeks after symptom onset. penot et al. (2017) have isolated infectious ZIKV from vaginal samples collected 3 days after onset of symptoms from a woman with controlled HIV infection. symptomatic patients may develop fever and influenza-like symptoms relatively common in arboviral infections. these relatively mild symptoms last a few days and uncommonly result in hospitalization. more recently, however, ZIKV infection has been associated with neurological and ophthalmological complications. a positive PCR for ZIKV in her urine and IgM ZIKV antibody in her cerebrospinal fluid and serum passed away after 11 days. a possible confounder is the simultaneous occurrence of various arboviruses, such as Chikungunya and DENV, since these arboviruses can cause a direct CNS invasion with myelitis, encephalitis, and meningitis. axonal neuropathy (AMAN) with a rapid onset of disease (4 days to reach the plateau) anti-glycolipid antibodies were found in 31% of patients. but anti-ganglioside antibodies typical of AMAN were rarely present. the rate of fetal transmission and the actual incidence of congenital infections remain unclear. the virus has been detected in fetal cerebral tissues by RT-PCR and electron microscopy. mothers and their children underwent ophthalmological evaluation by biomicroscopy and fundus examination. none of the infected mothers presented eye lesions; however, their infants had gross pigment mottle in the macula and no foveal reflex. same group also reported on 57-day infant without microcephaly that had chorioretinal scar on the left eye. the authors described bilateral findings in 2/3 of the children examined. the authors determined that congenital ZIKV infection was associated with potentially blinding eye disease. encephalopathy syndromes, with seizures or electroencephalographic changes, were seen in Martinique as part of ZIKV infection, probably due to encephalitis. all 42 patients had neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV. only 56% of neutralizing antibodies were found in the serum from 98 patients without GBS. most patients had detectable ZIKV IgM. neurological Complications in newborns Zika infection confirmed in newborns with microcephaly. an up to 20-fold increase in the number of microcephaly cases in the French Polynesia, Brazil and other Latin American countries. 182 (53%) tested positive for ZIKV in the blood, urine, or both. the remaining 116 ZIKV-positive women gave birth to 117 live infants. 42% of the patients had grossly altered clinical and/or neuroimaging findings. the same group reported on a 57-day infant without microcephaly that had chorioretinal scar on the macula of the left eye. eye lesions were more frequent in infants whose mothers had symptoms during the first trimester and infants with smaller cephalic diameters. studies briefly described neuropathological changes induced by the intracerebral inoculation of ZIKV in newborn and adult mice. these studies briefly described the neuropathological changes induced by the intracerebral inoculation of ZIKV in newborn and adult mice. the study of the vulnerability of neural cells to ZIKV infection has become a focus of intense research. both ZIKV (MR766 strain) and DENV 2 (16681 strain) were capable of infecting human NSC. only ZIKV induced apoptosis in NSC, impaired the formation of neurospheres and decreased growth rate of human brain organoids. Liang et al. (2016) screened the effects of ten ZIKV-encoding potential proteins. they found that the co-expression of NS4A and NS4B induced autophagy, by impairing Akt/mTOR signaling. onorati et al. (2016) suggest that the efficient replication of ZIKV requires autophagy. cytoplasmic sensors of different forms of dsRNA are present during the replication of ssRNA virus. this would cause the relocation of pTBK1 from centrosomes to mitochondria. this would result in mitotic impairments in neocortical neuroepithelial stem cells. skin fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015), microglia (Meertens et al., 2017), astrocytes (Retallack et al., 2016; Meertens et al., 2017) and blood-brain barrier endothelial cells (Liu et al., 2017) despite the high expression of this receptor in NSC and cerebral organoids. treatment with a TLR3 competitive inhibitor only provided a modest protection against the deleterious effects of ZIKV in neurospheres and cerebral organoids. infection with a strain isolated in Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PRVABC59) was not capable of inducing such a response \u2013 despite inducing apoptosis. a small fraction of the cells died after infection (Bayless et al., 2016). Moreover, ZIKV (PF-25013-18) induced the upregulation of the transcription factor IRF7 and several interferon-stimulated genes in human skin fibroblasts. both strains induced the same alterations in NPC (cell death and decreased proliferation) and caused similar gene expression changes. TP53 (coding for the tumor suppressor protein p53) was significantly upregulated following the infection with the Asian strain, but only marginally upregulated after the infection with the African strain. mice deficient in type I (A129 mice) or type I/II interferon receptors (AG129) showed a lethal infection in AG129 mice. animals exhibited early serum viremia and high viral loads in several organs. one of the most striking observations was the extensive infiltration of neutrophils in the brain. lazear et al. (2016) established a lethal infection in triple knockout mice deficient for IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7. they also showed that the African strain MR766 was less pathogenic to A129 mice than the French Polynesian ZIKV strain. astrocytes were the first targets of the virus in the brain, followed by the infection of neurons. infected cells were also found in the spinal cord, cerebellum, retina and different regions of the visual pathway. three studies have also reported the effects of injecting ZIKV into the lateral ventricles of embryonic day 13.5 mice. they found cortical thinning, massive neuronal death, glial activation and abnormal vascular density and permeability. they also found that ZIKV induced the death of immature and mature neurons and reduced NPC proliferation. newborns from the SJL ZIKV-infected mice had a high viral load in the brain, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), cortical malformations and ocular defects. newborns from the SJL ZIKV-infected mice had a high viral load in the brain, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), cortical malformations and ocular defects. Xavier-Neto et al. (2017) showed a window of susceptibility between 5.5 and 9.5 days post coitum for ZIKV-induced teratogenesis in pregnant mice. their model of ZIKV (HS-2015-BA-01, isolated from a Brazilian patient) caused gross and generalized malformations, IUGR and neural tube defects in the embryos/fetuses. ZIKV infection caused testis damage, oligospermia and decreased sex hormone production in adult mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 blocking antibodies. tests were also observed after intraperitoneal inoculation of ZIKV (Asian strain SMGC-1) in A129 mice and after intratesticular injection of ZIKV in WT mice. fetuses if there is a high viral load in the maternal vagina and/or blood, or if the virus is directly inoculated in the brain. at postnatal day 0, they found evidence of cortical thinning and microglial activation in the brain of pups from ZIKV-infected dams. studies using animal models represent an important step for the development of new therapies. ZIKV infection induced T-cell responses and protected non-human primates from re-infection or from heterologous ZIKV infection. pregnant macaques infected at mid-first semester, however, exhibited persistent viremia, although the amniotic fluid was negative for ZIKV. a model of intraocular ZIKV inoculation in mice has already been developed. the model will permit the investigation of ZIKV-induced dysfunction of the retina and visual pathway. the causal relationship between ZIKV and birth defects has been inferred by using the Shepard criteria for proof of human teratogenicity. human organotypic fetal brain slices (Onorati et al., 2016; Retallack et al., 2016) and immortalized cells lines also have been employed to study the neurovirulence of ZIKV. Tang et al. (2016) were the first to show that the MR766 strain of ZIKV infected iPSC-derived forebrain-specific human NPC. infected organoids decreased the number of proliferating cells and induced apoptosis in infected and non-infected cells. the ventricular zone and the neuronal layer were thinner and the ventricles were enlarged in infected organoids. infection with either the Brazilian ZIKV or the Cambodian ZIKV strain caused mitotic abnormalities and increased the number of neural stem/progenitor cells with supernumerary centrosomes. supernumerary foci of centriolar proteins have also been found after ZIKV infection (Polynesia strain PF-25013-18) in untransformed human retinal epithelia RPE-1 cells and human CHME3 microglial cells, but not in the NPC Gabriel et al. suggested a link between centrosomal structural defects in ZIKV-infected human NPC and the premature differentiation of NPC. the knowledge of the cell biology of ZIKV is still scarce, but recent advances have provided insights on the life cycle of this pathogen. ZIKV infection provokes changes in the pattern of cellular and viral RNA methylation. it induces a major impact on the transcriptome of the host cell. treatment with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) decreased the size of neurospheres in a similar fashion to the infection with ZIKV. human embryonic stem cells-derived cranial neural crest cells were induced to secrete high concentrations of several cytokines and growth factors. ZIKV (PF-25013-18) induced the upregulation of the transcription factor IRF7 and several interferon-stimulated genes in human skin fibroblasts. strains of ZIKV currently tested have been shown to induce nearly the same cytopathological effects in NPC. the Brazilian strain failed to replicate and did not change the number of neurons, suggesting that the Brazilian virus strain underwent adaptive changes in human cells. other cell types, such as microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, can also be infected. it is unknown how the interplay between different cell types contribute to the outcome of microcephaly. neurosphere formation decreased proliferation rates of NSC derived from human fetuses, and reduced their capacity to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes. they showed that the co-expression of NS4A and NS4B induced autophagy, by impairing Akt/mTOR signaling. they suggested that the efficient replication of ZIKV requires autophagy. the importance of ZIKV-induced centrosomal abnormalities was reinforced by recent findings from Gabriel et al. (Gabriel et al., 2017), who suggested a link between centrosomal structural defects in ZIKV-infected human NPC and the premature differentiation of NPC. this would result in the depletion of the NPC pool. ZIKV infection provokes changes in the pattern of cellular and viral RNA methylation. it induces a major impact on the transcriptome of the host cell. treatment with a TLR3 competitive inhibitor only provided a modest protection against the deleterious effects of ZIKV in neurospheres and cerebral organoids. ZIKV infection (MR766) was also shown to downregulate several immune response genes in a human microglial cell line. other studies have found that ZIKV is capable of inducing an immune response in human fetal brain microglia. current evidence indicates that ZIKV preferentially infects NPC. all strains of ZIKV currently tested have been shown to induce nearly the same cytopathological effects in NPC. few studies have addressed whether there are mechanistic differences among the strains. p53 was not restricted to iPSC-derived human NPC expressing high levels of viral antigens. other cell types, such as microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, can also be infected. the first signs of disease appeared at 10 days after the intraperitoneal inoculation. mice developed acute neutrophilic encephalopathy and had to be euthanized at 14 days post-inoculation. all mice died within 21 days after the infection. mice infected with a Cambodian strain of ZIKV (FSS13025) through a retro-orbital injection showed signs of viral illness and hindlimb weakness. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the infection increased the number of apoptotic cells and reduced the number of proliferative cells in these neurogenic niches. infection was often lethal and caused growth restriction and motor dysfunction. animals infected through the intracerebral or the subcutaneous routes showed neurological symptoms and severe illness. injected an Asian strain of ZIKV (SZ01) in the lateral ventricles of embryonic day 13.5 mice. they confirmed the tropism of ZIKV for NPC. at a later time-point (5 days post-infection) almost all cells in the brain were positive for ZIKV. newborns from the SJL ZIKV-infected mice had a high viral load in the brain, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), cortical malformations and ocular defects. these alterations, however, were not observed in pups from C57BL/6 ZIKV-infected mice, indicating that the virus was not able to cross the placenta in this mouse strain. this is in contrast with the findings of van den Pol e pregnant mice were infected with ZIKV (H/PF/2013) through the subcutaneous route on embryonic days 6.5 or 7.5. this model resulted in high levels of ZIKV RNA in the placenta. IUGR and a large number of apoptotic cells in the brain were found in the remaining fetuses. the possibility of ZIKV transmission through sexual contact was investigated by Yockey et al. (2016), who demonstrated that ZIKV replicates in the vaginal tract of WT mice after the intravaginal inoculation. while WT mice did not develop disease, A129 mice developed hindlimb paralysis and died within 9 days. studies using animal models represent an important step for the development of new therapies. this includes the utilization of non-human primate models in preclinical translational studies. the infection of Indian-origin rhesus macaques results in transient viremia and uremia. dley et al. (2016) showed the vertical transmission of ZIKV after the subcutaneous inoculation of a pregnant pigtail macaque at 119 days of gestation. this model caused fetal brain lesions, including white matter injury and gliosis, brain growth arrest and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the subependymal zone, a neurogenic niche. smussen et al. (2017) found evidence of causality between ZIKV and congenital abnormalities. full spectrum of neurological complications and long-term sequelae of ZIKV infection remain to be determined. acute multifocal neutrophilic encephalitis, inflammatory lesions in the cerebellum and multifocal neutrophilic myelitis were also observed after the subcutaneous inoculation of AG129 mice with the Malaysian strain of ZIKV. similar findings were reported after the infection of A129 mice with an African strain (MP1751), a Cambodian strain (FSS13025), or a french polynesian strain of ZIKV (H/PF/2013 the viral envelope protein was detected mainly in the subventricular zone and in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, two neurogenic regions in adults. immunocompetent mouse strains (CD1, C57BL/6 and 129Sv/Ev mice) are resistant to the subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation of ZIKV. mice with ZIKV (MR766) were infected through the intracerebral route. infection of postnatal day 7 mice decreased the number of proliferating cells in the ventricular zone. this resulted in widespread neuronal apoptosis and in the activation of microglia and astrocytes throughout the brain at 4 days post-infection. in both studies, there was no evidence of disruption of cortical lamination. the global transcriptome analyses of infected brains showed upregulation of genes involved in immune-response-related and apoptosis pathways. animal models corroborate the evidence from in vitro and ex vivo studies. Xavier-Neto et al. (2016) showed a window of susceptibility between 5.5 and 9.5 days post coitum for ZIKV-induced teratogenesis in pregnant mice. they found the virus in radial glial cells localized in the ventricular zone of the fetal brains, 3 days after infection. IUGR and a large number of apoptotic cells in the brain were found in the remaining fetuses. they treated pregnant mice with a blocking anti-interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (MAR1-5A3) 24 or 48 h before the inoculation o ZIKV. this protocol did not cause fetal demise but caused mild IUGR and placental and fetal infection. this model of intravaginal infection in WT mice can lead to IUGR if the maternal infection occurs during early pregnancy, even in the absence of viremia. it has been shown that ZIKV can infect the fetal brain and cause developmental abnormalities in immunocompetent fetuses. in vitro and ex vivo models have been used in preclinical translational studies. it has been shown that the infection of Indian-origin rhesus macaques with French polynesian, South American, Puerto Rican or Thai ZIKV strains results in transient viremia and uremia. a model of intraocular ZIKV inoculation in mice has already been developed. the causal relationship between ZIKV and birth defects has been inferred by using the Shepard\u2019s criteria for proof of human teratogenicity. a number of infectious disease threats have emerged that were deemed to be such a risk that they demanded a global response. the overarching principles of the public health response were the same \u2013 development of policies and procedures, risk communication, effective surveillance, and disease control measures to mitigate the risk of infection in the population. microbiological testing for ZIKV is not straightforward and was not widely available at the outset of the epidemic. the development of laboratory guidelines accelerated following the announcement that the world was experiencing a PHEIC. the guidelines for various agencies became more consistent with one another. the more robust systems are those where notification of ZIKV is included in the list of reportable infectious diseases mandated by law. population-based serological studies can be undertaken in zika-affected countries to better understand the level of population immunity at a point in time. aims of vector surveillance are to determine when and where competent vectors are active in a country. most affected countries can rely on existing vector control programs. but such programs are resource-intensive and need to be well-planned to ensure an efficient use of resources. some countries have high rates of unplanned pregnancies, strict abortion laws, a lack of sexuality education programs in schools, and poor access to contraception. asymptomatic infection means that the advice needs to relate to anyone traveling to endemic areas, not just those who develop symptoms. disease control agencies advise a lesser risk period for women to defer pregnancy following their (or their partner\u2019s) return from Zika-affected areas. a third category includes those countries where ZIKV infection is not endemic but are receptive to the virus. study of blood donors during the outbreak in french polynesia found that 3% were positive for ZIKV by PCR while asymptomatic. risk is small, however, with only one report of infection caused by transfusion of platelets. some countries require blood donors who have traveled to Zika-affected areas defer their donation for a period after their return. policy and protocols Because of the novel and unanticipated nature of the public health emergency relating to ZIKV, there were no specific pre-existing policies and protocols to guide the public health response. guidelines were largely focused on women of reproductive age, their partners, and their clinicians, providing advice on how infection could be prevented. modeling shows that this period will last approximately 3 years, with a further decade or more before large epidemics are once again possible. it is important for a country to know where on the epidemic curve it is at any point in time, so that the risk to the population is understood. the complication of GBS is rare, estimated to be 2.4 cases per 10,000 people infected during the 2013\u20132014 outbreak in French Polynesia. estimates of the incidence of GBS from a number of central and south american countries affected by ZIKV range from 2.0 to 9.8-fold higher than pre-epidemic baselines. specific stakeholder groups should include pregnant women, women of reproductive age and their partners, community organizations, schools, health care workers, the media, local and international organizations involved in reproductive health. key messages should include prevention of unintended pregnancies by the use of reversible contraception methods; using insect repellents, mosquito nets and other mosquito avoidance measures. women who are planning a pregnancy wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible ZIKV infection has cleared. women who are planning a pregnancy wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible ZIKV infection has cleared. governments and non-government organizations must implement vector surveillance and control programs at global, national and local levels. a study of blood donors during the outbreak in French Polynesia found that 3% were positive for ZIKV by PCR while asymptomatic. 3% were positive for ZIKV by PCR while asymptomatic. the risk is small, but only one report of infection caused by transfusion of platelets. some countries require blood donors who have traveled to Zika-affected areas defer their donation for a period after their return or after any sexual contact with a known case. candidate recently showed complete protection against detectable viremia in challenged mice and later on in rhesus macaques. similar issues apply for recombinant heterologous viral vectored vaccines. a recombinant vaccine that incorporates prM-E proteins into a rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 viral vector has recently shown complete protection in challenged monkeys. as today, more than 30 vaccine candidates are in active preclinical development. three have already been approved by the FDA to enter phase I clinical trials. there are concerns over the possible interaction of preexisting flavivirus immunity with neutralization and/or enhancement, since several flavivirus cocirculate in the ZIKV endemic areas. however, no such ADE effect has been observed in ZIKV infected animal models challenge with WNV. antivirals There are no approved specific antiviral agents against any flavivirus. treatment is generally directed to symptom relief with analgesics and antipyretic. in the past months, several drugs have been tested as antiviral candidates. non-peptidic small molecules targeting other viral proteins were capable of inhibiting ZIKV multiplication in cell culture. it has been reported that passive transfer of human neutralizing antibodies to pregnant mice suppressed ZIKV replication and prevent microcephaly. zetomib, sertraline (Barrows et al., 2016), palonosetron (Pascoalino et al., 2016), tenovir-1 (Kuivanen et al., 2017), tenovir-1 (Kuivanen et al., 2017), obatoclax (Rausch et al., 2017), PHA-690509, and emirascan (Xu alum-adjuvanted whole inactivated ZIKV (ZPIV) vaccine candidate recently showed complete protection against detectable viremia in challenged mice and later on in rhesus macaques. similar issues apply for recombinant heterologous viral vectored vaccines and, therefore, none of them have been licensed to date. a gene-ZIKV expressing the full-length ZIKV prM-E proteins induced complete protection against viremia in mice and rhesus macaques. a recombinant vaccine ZIKV/JEV prM-E DNA constructs has shown high levels of protection against viremia in challenged rhesus macaques. NIAID is an alum adjuvanted ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV) that has entered clinical trial in healthy flavivirus-nave and flavivirus-primed subjects. there are also concerns over the possible interaction of preexisting flavivirus immunity with neutralization and/or enhancement, since several flavivirus cocirculate in the ZIKV endemic areas. there are tests that take months to be evaluated, but that should be addressed even under emergency circumstances. the development of possible adverse effects derived from ADE of infection of related flavivirus (deNV) should be considered before starting large-scale vaccination campaigns. the pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors NITD008, CID 91632869, finasteride, brequinar, 6-azauridine, gemcitabine, and 5-fluorouracil reduced viral multiplication to different levels. even more, NITD008 improved survival rates in treated mice infected with ZIKV. anti-ZIKV inhibitors have also been assayed. the anti-ZIKV inhibitors are less prone to induce the emergence of resistant virus. antiparasitics and antimalarials, such as ivermectin, chloroquine, quinacrine, mefloquine, GSK-36796, and pyrimethamine, have also been shown to reduce ZIKV multiplication. despite the great effort made by the scientific community, it will take time until any drug against ZIKV will be commercially available."}
