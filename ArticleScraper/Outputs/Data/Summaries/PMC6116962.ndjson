{"summary": "102 viral same-strand overlapping gene pairs were compiled from the literature. 10 were discarded because one or both of the genes involved in the overlap were not found in the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) databases. six of these pairs were ssDNA, five were retroviruses, and the remaining 81 were RNA viruses. RSCU i = X i 1 n i = 1 n X i where X i is the number of occurrences of codon i in the viral genome, and 1 n 6 is the number of synonymous codons that code for the same amino acid as codon i. the relative adaptedness value ( w i ) for each codon in a viral species was then calculated as: w i = RSCU i RSCU max receiver operating characteristic plot for determining which member of an overlapping gene pair has higher CAI. only genes with an overlapping region of at least 200 nucleotides are plotted. p104/p130 overlap in the Providence virus. relative ages of 39 genes were classified via phylogenetic analysis. 20 through phylogenetic analysis alone (blue circle), 18 supported via codon analysis (yellow circle) nonoverlapping and preoverlapping controls. 150 nonoverlapping genes were compiled from the viral species. ancestral > nonoverlapping either inframe (yellow) or matched frameshifted control. the preadaptation version of the constraint hypothesis is supported by the fact that nonoverlapping ISD preoverlapping (compare the two yellow bars) overlapping sequences were classified as homologous. some homologous pairs had such dissimilar protein sequences that ISD values were essentially independent. we manually analyzed sequence similarity within each homology group. UPred assigns a score between 0 and 1 to each amino acid. the average score was taken across only the relevant subset of amino acids. the optimal value of for the combined ancestral, novel and artificially-frameshifted nonoverlapping, non-ORF control group data was 0.41. all four terms were easily retained in all other model variants exploring different nongenic controls. we also considered overlap type (internal vs. terminal) as a fixed effect. but removed it because it did not significantly enhance our model. novel genes are expected to have less extreme codon bias than ancestral genes due to evolutionary inertia. codon usage data was used to calculate a relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value for each codon in a viral species. TG and TGG codons are the only codons that code for their respective amino acids and so their relative adaptedness values are always 1. in each overlapping pair, we provisionally classified the gene with the higher CAI value as ancestral and the gene with lower CAI value as novel. in total, 27 gene pairs were determined to have statistically-significant CAI values. the ancestral member of the pair was acquired through horizontal gene transfer. this renders codon usage an unreliable predictor of relative gene ages. in total, we were able to classify ancestral vs. novel status for 47 overlapping gene pairs. any stop codons that appeared in the new reading frames were removed. ISD results support the birth-facilitation and (preadaptation version of the) conflict resolution hypotheses. phylogenetic confounding can be corrected by using gene family as a random effect term in a linear model. we constructed a pHMMer database including all overlapping regions, nonoverlapping genes and their frameshifted controls. sequences that were identified as homologous were provisionally assigned the same homology group ID. IUPred assigns a score between 0 and 1 to each amino acid. the average score was taken across only the relevant subset of amino acids. species is a stand-in for a number of viral proteins. we used the lmer and gls functions contained in the nlme and lme4 R packages to generate the linear mixed models. the main model used frameshifted non-ORF nonoverlapping genes as the nongenic control. frame affects ISD We artificially frameshifted 150 nonoverlapping viral genes in those 80 species. the overlapping regions of genes in the +2 reading frame had higher mean ISD ( 0.48 0.03 ) than those in the +1 reading frame ( 0.31 0.02 ). type (novel vs. ancestral) as a fixed effect, species (to control for %GC content and other subtle sequence biases) as a random effect, and homology group (to control for phylogenetic confounding) as a random effect. 001427 Chicken anemia virus VP2 Apoptin 366 +1 NC_003688 Cucurbit aphid-born yellowing virusif,g,h CP P5 572 +1 NC_005899 Dendrolimus punctatus Tetravirusf p71 p17 381 +1 NC_016561 hepatitis Bb P L 1128 +1 NC_003608 Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virusf Coat p25 675 2b 308 +1 NC_003448 Striped Jack nervous necrosis virus Protein A B2 228 +1 NC_001366 Theiler\u2019s virus L L* 471 +1 NC_002199 Tupaia paramyxovirusi P C 462 +1 NC_003743 Turnip yellows virusf,g,h CP ORF5 528 +1 NC_001409 Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus CP MP 317 +2 NC_0017 g Novel genes predicted homologous in HMMer run. i Novel genes predicted homologous in HMMer run. j Ancestral VP2 genes share 50 % protein sequence similarity. ancestral overlapping sequences have higher ISD than nonoverlapping genes. this seems to be because ISD was already high at the time of de novo gene birth. overlapping genes have indistinguishable ISD from preoverlapping homologs. birth facilitation accounts for 32 13 % of the estimated total difference in ISD between overlapping and nonoverlapping genes. the two members of an overlapping pair share the same %GC content, and random sequences with higher %GC have substantially higher ISD. this could be responsible for the trait correlation. 31 of the novel genes were in the +1 frame of their ancestral counterparts, while only 10 were in the +2 frame. this unexpected result is stronger for \u201cinternal overlaps\u201d in which one gene is completely contained within its overlapping partner. the +1 frame (1 per 33) than the +2 frame (1 per 169) and fewer stop codons in the +1 frame (1 per 20) than the +2 frame (1 per 13) the same pattern was found in the preoverlapping ancestral homologs. the same pattern was found in the preoverlapping ancestral homologs. the overlapping regions of genes in the +2 reading frame had higher mean ISD ( 0.48 0.03 ) than those in the +1 reading frame ( 0.31 0.02 ). the birth-facilitation hypothesis is supported by the birth-facilitation hypothesis. the +2 frame difference is supported with P = 0.006.
