{"summary": "Material and Methods Collection of Human Saliva was collected from PUUV-infected patients who were hospitalized from January through may 2007. samples were obtained from patients with typical clinical symptoms of acute NE. the collection was random, with no consideration of time of the day or food intake. the real-time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System 2.0. the plasmid was linearized with the restriction enzyme ApaI. the RNA control was diluted, added to patient sample, and used as template for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. patient serum was pretreated with rheumatoid factor absorbent (VirionSerion GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) to eliminate possible interference of rheumatoid factor and PUUV-specific IgG. slides were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and antibody was detected by using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit F(ab\u2032)2 anti-human antibodies (F0317, DAKO A/S) diluted in PBS collection of human Saliva was collected from PUUV-infected patients. samples were obtained from patients with typical clinical symptoms of acute NE. the collection was random, with no consideration of time of the day or food intake. real-time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System 2.0. a 72-bp Drosophila melanogaster fragment was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector. the plasmid was linearized with the restriction enzyme ApaI. RNA was transcribed and purified as described. patient serum was pretreated with rheumatoid factor absorbent (VirionSerion GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) to eliminate possible interference of rheumatoid factor and PUUV-specific IgG. slides were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and antibody was detected by using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit F(ab\u2032)2 anti-human antibodies. hantavirus RNA in Saliva from 14 hospitalized NE patients. all patients were positive for PUUV RNA in plasma by a real-time RT-PCR. 13 patients had PUUV-specific IgM antibodies in serum. most plasma and serum samples were collected the same day or within 1 day before or after the saliva sample and antibody was detected by immunofluorescence assay. most plasma and serum samples were collected the same day or within 1 day before or after the saliva sample and antibody was detected by immunofluorescence assay. most plasma and serum samples were collected the same day or within 1 day before or after the saliva sample and antibody was detected. seven patients had respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, or both. a chest radiograph revealed infiltrates in 2 of the patients with respiratory symptoms. all patients with respiratory symptoms, except 1 (patient 12), had PUUV RNA. RNA in saliva, copies/mL PUUV RNA in plasma, copies/mL PUUV IgM in serum PUUV IgG titer in serum 1 M 65 6 121,323 959,294. most plasma and serum samples were collected the same day or within 1 day before or after the saliva sample was detected by immunofluorescence assay. a PUUV S-segment sequence was identical for each saliva/plasma pair. the observed nucleotide mismatches did not result in different amino acid sequences. the sequence from patient 2 was from another S-segment region. PUUV RNA in saliva decreased with time in the individual patient. PUUV viremia is thought to persist for 5\u20137 days. but in our study, 1 patient had PUUV in both saliva and plasma 9 days after first appearance of disease. hantavirus RNA in saliva detected in our study is infectious. the only human PUUV isolate from Sweden was isolated with leukocytes. PUUV antigen was not detected until 6 months after infection of vero E6 cells. hantavirus-specific antibodies in human saliva may be useful for diagnostics. PUUV RNA was detected in plasma from Cynomolgus macaques 4 days before symptoms appeared. studies are needed to determine whether the same is true for saliva in animal models. we cannot exclude inhalation of rodent excreta as the main or only transmission route. our results support the hypothesis that person-to-person transmission may occur by this route."}
