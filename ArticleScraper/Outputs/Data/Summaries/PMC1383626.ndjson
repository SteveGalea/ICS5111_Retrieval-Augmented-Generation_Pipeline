{"summary": "ribosomal frameshifting is one of these recoding mechanisms. a 1 frameshift event takes place in most cases, such as the gag-pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (12), the 1a/1b gene of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (9) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (8,13). the 5\u2032 unique region of mRNA 1 encodes two large polyproteins, 1a and 1ab. the 1ab polyprotein is translated by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. a conserved slippery sequence (U UUA AAC) was identified in the 1a/1b region as the slippage site. omic mRNA three transcripts with six, seven, eight and nine Us from the sera of SARS patients (21) evidence provided here demonstrates that the seven and eight U stretches could function as sole elements for efficient +1 and 1 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of these ORF 3a variants. semi-confluent Cos-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with five plaque forming units per cell of the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus. at 24 h post transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 l of 2 SDS loading buffer. PCR fragment covering EGFP from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was digested with BglII and EcoRV. cloned into pSARS-3a/7T, generating pEGFP-3a/7T. deletions in EGFP and 3a regions were made by overlapping PCR. the polyclonal antibody against full-length 3a was raised in rabbits. in vitro transcription and translation One microgram of each plasmid DNA was transcribed and translated in a total of 50 l reaction mixture in a TnT coupled in vitro translation system. RNA was resuspended in 20 l of distilled water for 1 h. one microliter from the reaction was taken out for PCR using appropriate primers. cDNA was amplified by PCR and digested with EcoRV and EcoRI. pLuc-6T and pLuc-7T were made by insertion of six and seven Ts. all constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing analysis. a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. expression of pSARS-3a/6T (lane 1), pSARS-3a/7T (lane 2) and pSARS-3a/8T (lane 3) in bacterial cells. expression of pET3a-His/6T (lane 1), pET3a-His/7T (lane 2) and pET3a-His/8T (lane 3) is indicated. expression of pF-3a/6T (lane 2), pF-3a/7T (lane 3) and pF-3a/8T (lane 4) in cos-7 cells. cells were transfected with the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus. at 18 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysates prepared. the 32 kDa 3a protein was detected by western blot with anti-Flag antibody (Figure 1d, lane 2). the full-length 3a protein was also detected in cells expressing the two ORF 3a variants with seven (pF-3a/7T) and eight (pF-3a/8T) Ts. the detection of the full-length 3a protein from these two expression systems confirms that the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches could direct the absence of the full-length 3a protein expression is due to the point mutations introduced into the seven T stretch. mutants were labeled with [35S]methionine, separated on SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. no deletion of nucleotides or revision of mutations in the seven T regions during transcription of wild type and mutant constructs. cos-7 cells transfected with pF-3a/7T and the eight mutant constructs were lysed by Trizol reagent at 24 h post transfection. total RNA was extracted from cells expressing and 1 g of RNA was used for RT\u2013PCR. a cDNA fragment covering ORF3a with seven Ts was fused in frame to the 3\u2032 end of the EGFP. expression of this construct was expected to produce a 29 kDa protein. if frameshifting did occur during translation of this construct, a 55 kDa product terminated at the original UAA codon for 3a. the termination codon TAA for +1 frame is underlined and in bold. pEGFP-3a/7T (lanes 1 and 6), pEGFP1-3a (lanes 2 and 7), pEGFP2-3a (lanes 3 and 8) and pEGFP3-3a (lanes 4 and 9) in in vitro reticulocyte lysates (lanes 1\u20134) and in Cos-7 cells (lanes 5\u20139). expression of these constructs in cos-7 cells showed the detection of the frameshifting product by western blot with polyclonal anti-3a antibodies. analysis of the sequences downstream of the seven Us using the MFOLD program predicated two potential stem\u2013loops forming from nt 39 to 56. loop regions could partially base pair with the downstream sequences and form a potential pseudoknot interaction. pLuc-6T, pLuc-7T, pLuc-7T, pF-S1ab, pF-S1ab/7T and pLuc-7T. a minor band of 60 kDa, representing a product probably initiated from an internal AUG codon, was also detected. polypeptides separated on SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide and analyzed by western blot with anti-luciferase antibodies. bands corresponding to full-length luciferase and --tubulin are indicated. cells were transfected with the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus. construct in cos-7 cells led to the detection of a 25 kDa 1a termination product and a 50 kDa frameshifting product (Figure 4c, lane 2). replacement of the original slippage site (T TTA AAC) with eight Ts in pF-S1ab/8T produced two products similar to the two proteins produced from the construct with the original slippage site (Figure 4c, lane 3). mutant constructs pF-S1ab, pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/8TM were then expressed in Cos-7 cells. expression of pF-S1ab showed, once again, the detection of the 1a termination and 1ab frameshifting products. pF-S1ab (lane 1), pF-S1abM (lane 2), pF-S1ab/7T (lane 6), pF-S1ab/7TM (lane 7), pF-S1ab/8T (lane 3) and pF-S1ab/8T (lane 4) in cos-7 cells. at 18 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysates prepared. expression of pF-slab/7T showed, once again, the detection of 35% of the frameshifting efficiency (Figure 6b, lane 2). Mutation of the first T to either A or C significantly reduces the frameshifting efficiency to 1% of wild type. however, mutation of the seventh T to C results in the detection of 15% of frameshifting product (Figure 6b, lane 5). cells were harvested and lysates prepared at 18 h posttransfection. polypeptides were separated on SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide gel. bands corresponding to 1ab, the frameshifting products (FS) and -tubulin indicated. the efficiencies of the 31 kDa 3a protein expressed from these two constructs are 32 and 20%, respectively, compared with that expressed from pSARS-3a/6T. the results reveal that frameshift events may occur during translation of ORF 3a variants with seven and eight Us. expression of pF-3a/6T (lane 2), pF-3a/7T (lane 3) and pF-3a/8T (lane 4) in cos-7 cells. at 18 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysates prepared. expression of these ORF 3a variants was then tested in bacteria. expression of the Flag-tagged 3a from pF-3a/6T in cos-7 cells showed very efficient detection of the 32 kDa 3a protein by western blot with anti-Flag antibody. the full-length 3a protein was also detected in cells expressing the two ORF 3a variants with seven (pF-3a/7T) and eight (pF-3a/8T) Ts. the absence of the full-length 3a protein expression is due to the point mutations introduced into the seven T stretch. however, the full-length 3a expression was significantly decreased to an undetectable level when mutants M1 to M7 were expressed (Figure 2b, lanes 2\u20138) western blot analysis with anti-3a and anti-Flag antibodies led to the detection of the full-length 3a protein in cells transfected with pF-3a/7T and pF-3a/7TM8 respectively. no deletion of nucleotides or revision of mutations in the seven T regions during transcription of wild type and mutant constructs. a cDNA fragment covering ORF3a with seven Ts was fused in frame to the 3\u2032 end of the EGFP, giving rise to construct pEGFP-3a/7T. expression of this plasmid in RRL in vitro showed the detection of a major 29 kDa protein. the seven T stretch is underlined, the termination codon TGA for 0 frame is italic and underlined. the termination codon TAA for +1 frame is underlined and in bold. also shown are the nucleotides deleted in each construct. sequences deleted in these constructs are in the EGFP coding region. expression of these constructs in cos-7 cells showed the detection of the frameshifting product by western blot with polyclonal anti-3a antibodies. sequences downstream of the seven Us were made based on pEGFP-3a/7T. the six and seven Ts were first inserted into the luciferase gene 14 nt downstream of the initiator AUG. expression of these two constructs in Cos-7 cells showed the detection of the 65 kDa full-length luciferase protein in cells expressing pLuc-6T. a minor band of 60 kDa, representing a product probably initiated from an internal AUG codon, was also detected. polypeptides were separated on SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide and analyzed by western blot with anti-luciferase antibodies. bands corresponding to full-length luciferase and --tubulin are indicated. cells were transfected with the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus. expression of this construct in cos-7 cells led to the detection of a 25 kDa 1a termination product and a 50 kDa frameshifting product. replacement of the original slippage site (T TTA AAC) with eight Ts in pF-S1ab/8T produced two products similar to the two proteins produced from the construct. the termination product therefore contains both the 1a and 1b regions. mutant constructs pF-S1ab, pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/8TM were expressed in cos-7 cells. expression of pF-S1ab showed the detection of the 1a termination and 1ab frameshifting products. similar results were obtained when pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/7TM were expressed. pF-S1ab (lane 1), pF-S1abM (lane 2), pF-S1ab/7T (lane 6), pF-S1ab/7TM (lane 7), pF-S1ab/8T (lane 3) and pF-S1ab/8T (lane 4) in cos-7 cells. the downstream stimulatory sequence has differential effects on frameshifting efficiencies mediated by the hepta-ur mutation of the first and fourth Ts to Cs (pF-slab/7TM14C) were made based on pF-slab/7T. expression of pF-slab/7T showed, once again, the detection of 35% of the frameshifting efficiency. mutation of the seventh T to C significantly reduces the frameshifting efficiency to 1% of wild type. cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus. cells were harvested and lysates prepared. polypeptides were separated on SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide gel. hepta- and octo-uridine stretches are sole elements for efficient ribosomal frameshifting. mutations introduced into stem II of the SARS-CoV ORF 1b region abolished frameshifting mediated by the original slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b. mutations introduced into stem II of the SARS-CoV ORF 1b region totally abolished frameshifting mediated by the original slippery sequence of SARS-Co mutants pF-3a/M5, M6 and M7 maintained perfect base pairs at the P site in the event of +1 frameshifting. it suggests that re-pairing at the A site was not successful, resulting in the reduction of the frameshifting efficiency. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that a slippage-independent mechanism, such as GAG3-POL3 genes of yeast Ty3, could account for this event. sequence specific elements, such as the Shine\u2013Dalgarno (24,25) or sequences partially complementary with yeast 18S rRNA (26), are required. space between the slippage site and the stimulatory element also plays a critical regulatory role in the frameshifting efficiency (24) length 3a protein from ORF3a variants with seven and eight Us is transcriptional slippage. the protein could slip and insert non-templated nucleotide(s) into the growing RNA chain. examples include expression of dnaX in Thermus thermophilus (28) and bacterial IS elements (29)."}
