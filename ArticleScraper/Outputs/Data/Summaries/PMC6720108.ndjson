{"summary": "most common RPE used by HCWs are surgical masks and NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) the most common RPE used by HCWs is surgical masks and surgical masks. loose-fitting PAPRs do not require annual fit-testing and can be used by HCWs who cannot achieve a good fit with N95 FFRs. if inspiratory flow exceeds the airflow delivered by the blower, unfiltered air may leak in. the results obtained from this field study may assist in improving the scientific basis for future updates to NIOSH PAPR standards. the device features a compact design (0.5 kg) and can be worn by a worker without significant interference with the routine job tasks. 2 #1 M 43 117.93 1.65 2.21 43.27 #2 F 39 86.18 1.63 1.91 32.61 #3 F 21 113.4 1.65 2.17 41.60 #4 F 44 65.77 1.50 1.60 29.29 #5 F 45 56.70 1.65 1.62 20.80 #6 M 43 61.24 1.60 1.63 23.91 #7 F 28 58.97 1.60 1.61 23.03 #8 F 49 60.33 1.60 1.62 23.56 # the device features a compact design (0.5 kg) and can be worn by a worker without significant interference with the routine job tasks. the device consists of a data logger, a pressure sensor and a breathing mask. .77 1.50 1.60 29.29 #5 F 45 56.70 1.65 1.62 20.80 #6 M 43 61.24 1.60 1.63 23.91 #7 F 28 58.97 1.60 1.61 23.03 #8 F 49 60.33 1.60 1.62 23.56 #9 F 22 68.04 1.65 1.75 24.96. the change of MV, MIF, and PIF during the 30-min \u201cisolation unit work\u201d was minimal. the minimum, average standard deviation (SD) and maximum values of the MV, MIF, and PIF for the nine subjects tested were reported. the estimated average MV values for small, medium, and large sized people were 33, 36, and 41 L/min. the average MV was 33 L/min, with the range of 22\u201341 L/min. the average PIF was found to be 107 L/min, with the maximum airflow of 145 L/min. it was found that there was no significant difference between the theoretically calculated MV and PIF under the non-speech condition (Table 5) and the measured values (Table 4). however, the estimated MV and PIF under the speech condition were significantly different from the measured values (Table 4). the relationship between inspiratory flow rates and subjects\u2019 physical characteristics was investigated. the correlation results of MV, MIF, and PIF with weight, ADu and BMI were all positive and statistically significant. as the subjects\u2019 weight increased, the inspiratory flow increased significantly. the methods developed in this pilot study can characterize breathing flow for all other HCW groups. the methods developed in this pilot study were supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL)"}
