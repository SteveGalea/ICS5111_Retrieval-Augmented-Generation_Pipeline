{"summary": "CHIKV has been shown to infect and be transmitted by ae. aegyptii and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. the virus is of the Alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family [1], [2]. CHIKV is clinically characterized by the spread of the virus to temperate areas. severe joint pain is the defining symptom of CHIKV disease. symptoms start 4 to 7 days after exposure and most resolve within the acute phase of the disease. CHIKV symptoms start 4 to 7 days after exposure and most resolve within the acute phase. cytokine profiles were not determined for the progression and convalescence of CHIKV. cytokine profiles were found during the acute phase and 6- and 12-month follow-up of CHIKV infected patients. CHIKV patients showed symptoms such as myalgia, severe back and joint pain, headache, and skin rash. the clinical criteria was described as acute onset of fever (>38.5\u00b0C) and severe arthralgia not explained by other medical conditions. control samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers screened for symptoms of viral infection. blood samples were collected from consenting CHIKV positive patients at the time of diagnosis. patients from the region of Emilia-Romagna in north-east Italy suspected to be infected with CHIKV since they showed symptoms such as myalgia, severe back and joint pain, headache, and skin rash. the samples were considered high IgG if the IgG level was greater than 6400 (6 months) or greater than 3200 (12 months) CHIKV patients were considered non-symptomatic (15 patients out of 50 at the 6-month follow-up; 34 patients out of 50 at the 12 month follow-up; 14 patients out of 50 at the 12 month follow-up) cytokine profiles of acute phase CHIKV patients have been examined. blood samples were collected from 50 patients suffering from CHIKV infections during the 2007 Italian outbreak. cytokine bead analysis (CBA) for 13 cytokines. the first trend showed cytokine levels significantly higher in the acute samples compared to the follow-up time points. cytokines had significantly decreased at both 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. acute phase CHIKV disease was associated with high levels of IL-6, CXCL9, CCL2 and CXCL10. cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-12, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN- had significantly increased by 12 months. both the 6- and 12-month follow-up were statistically increased compared to acute values for IL-5 levels. cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-12, IL-10 and IFN- had significantly increased by 12 months. samples were analyzed for significance against healthy controls by the Mann-Whitney U test. the cross symbol indicates a p-value less than 0.05 for 6- and 12-month groups compared to acute values. the star symbol indicates a p-value (Mann-Whitney U test) less than 0.05 acute, 6- and 12-month groups compared to control values. CXCL9, IL-6 and IL-10 are possible biomarkers of virus, IgM and IgG levels in CHIKV patient serum. CHIKV patients were categorized into Viral stage (V), Antibody Initiation stage (AI) or Seroconversion stage (SC) the patients were put into an IgG high group (H) or an IgG low group (L) and the levels of each cytokine were statistically compared for each group using the Mann-Whitney U test. in the 6-month follow-up phase, CXCL9, CXCL10 and Il-6 were found to be statistically different between the high IgG group and the low IgG group. in 6- and 12-month patient serum samples were determined by ELISA. the samples were then grouped by IgG level; a low IgG level group (L) and a high IgG level group (H) no statistical difference was seen for any of the 13 cytokines profiled for the 12-month follow-up CHIKV patient samples. CHIKV disease severity is associated with high CXCL10, CXCL9 and IgG levels at the 6-month follow-up. CHIKV patients were determined to be nonsymptomatic (N), to have mild symptoms (M) or to have severe symptoms (S). cytokine and IgG levels were then grouped by symptom level. three cytokine profiles emerged from our data: decreasing, increasing and no-trend. the first trend showed cytokine levels significantly higher in the acute samples compared to the follow-up time points. cytokines had significantly decreased at both 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. cross symbol indicates a p-value less than 0.05 for 6- and 12-month groups compared to acute values. the dotted line indicates the median of healthy control cytokine levels. Acute (A), 6-month follow-up (6), and 12-month follow-up (12) CHIKV patient serum samples showed increased levels of TNF-, IL-5, IL-1, IL-12, IFN- and IL-10 following the acute phase of CHIKV disease patients. six-month and one-year cytokine levels were analysed for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon test for Significance. 0.05 acute, 6- and 12-month groups compared to control values. CXCL10, CXCL9, IL-6 and IL-10 are possible biomarkers of virus, IgM and IgG levels in CHIKV patient serum. median of CXCL10 in the viral stage was approximately 7000 pg/ml. antibody initiation stage (AI) or Seroconversion stage (SC) showed a significant decrease in CXCL10 and IL-10 from the Viral stage to the Seroconversion stage of the Acute phase. a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance among the phases. the stages of CHIKV 6- and 12-month follow-up phases are marked by differentials in CXCL10, CXCL9, IL-6 and CXCL9, IL-10 respectively. the samples were then grouped by IgG level; a low IgG level group (L) and a high IgG level group (H) no statistical difference was seen for any of the 13 cytokines profiled for the 12-month follow-up. the results showed IgG levels were statistically increased with symptom severity. CHIKV disease severity is associated with high CXCL10, CXCL9 and IgG levels at the 6-month time point. initial infection and subsequent convalescence were described by decreasing and increasing cytokines. CXCL10 and IL-10 levels were associated with the viral stage of the acute phase and CXCL10 and CXCL9 with high IgG levels of the 6-month follow-up. these identified signatures may be key to the development of therapeutics for the frequently re-emerging CHIKV disease. IL-6 is important during acute phases of the disease by acting as an important immune mediator of fever activating muscle metabolism to increase core body temperature. a second host immune response profile was characterized by TNF-, IL-1, Il-10, Il-12, IFN- and IL-5, which increased from the acute phase into convalescence. cytokine profiles have been analyzed from patients during an Asian outbreak of CHIKV [22]. previous study did not follow the patients during convalescence. IL-6, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were also increased in acute phase. we have identified 3 stages of the acute phase of the acute phase of WNV. a viral stage, antibody initiation stage, and seroconversion stage. a viral stage, antibody initiation stage, and serum cytokine levels decreased as patients progressed through the viral stage to seroconversion. our findings suggest high CXCL10 and CXCL9 associated with severity to be a unique signature of CHIKV. they have been shown to be biomarkers for RA symptoms, implying a similar mechanism for joint destruction in CHIKV disease. cytokine signatures described can also be applied when testing newly developed therapeutics. we found high concentrations of IgG to be associated with symptom severity in CHIKV patients. similar IgG mediated mechanisms leading to synovium destruction and severe pain experienced by CHIKV patients are possible."}
