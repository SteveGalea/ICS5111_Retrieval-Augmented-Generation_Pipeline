{"summary": "equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is one of the most neglected viruses among biowarfare agents. it causes disease with symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to more severe illnesses including myalgia, arthralgia, and neurological disorders. VEEV has drawn little public attention due to only sporadic outbreaks occurring in central and south America since 1995. despite high sensitivity of the above-mentioned methods, false negative results can be obtained if samples have been collected during the acute-phase of infection where the viral load is low. despite high sensitivity of the above-mentioned methods, the necessity of extra steps of plasma or serum preparation complicates fast virus identification and diagnostic. magnetic NT particles are functionalized with various dye affinity baits that facilitate capture and retention of analytes from complex biological matrixes. they are functionalized with various dye affinity baits that facilitate capture and retention of analytes from complex biological matrixes (such as blood, saliva, nasal swabs and urine) magnetic NT particles are functionalized with reactive red 120 to evaluate the efficacy of preservation of infectious VEEV in whole human blood at 40\u00b0C. NT Particle Screening VEEV TC83 was diluted to 1 106 PFU/mL in whole human blood or plasma followed by incubation with or without NT particles. the amount of the viral RNA was determined by RT-qPCR using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) whole human blood containing viral virions was mixed in 1:3 ratio with TriZol LS. samples were vortexed and 200 L of chloroform were added to the sample. purified RNA was used for cDNA synthesis followed by PCR reaction (30 cycles) Western Blotting VEEV TC83 was diluted to 1 106 PFU/mL in plasma. samples that were incubated without NT particles were processed using same method. a 1:2,000 dilution of primary anti-VEEV capsid antibody was applied. animal Experiment A total of 27 C3H/HeN mice (6\u20138-week-old) were randomly divided into three groups (n = 9) and VEEV-TC83 was diluted to 2 107 PFU/mL with PBS followed by intranasally administrated to anesthetized mice in the amount of 20 L/mouse. by 2, 3, and 4 days post-infection, 9 mice were sacrificed at each time point. VEEV suspension was mixed well with the same volume of 4% Glutaraldehyde to achieve a final concentration of 2% Glutaraldehyde. a drop (8 l) of the glutaraldehyde treated sample was placed on a formvar/carbon coated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid for 10 min in a moist chamber to reduce evaporation. the grid was then washed three times by touching the grid to the surface of drops NT Particle Screening VEEV TC83 was diluted to 1 106 PFU/mL in whole human blood or plasma followed by incubation with or without NT particles. the amount of the viral RNA was determined by RT-qPCR using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) RNA was purified using a combination of a TriZol\u00ae LS from Ambion and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) whole human blood containing viral virions was mixed in 1:3 ratio with TriZol LS. hundreds of microliters of PBS were added to the sample to increase the amount of the aqueous fraction. Western Blotting VEEV TC83 was diluted to 1 106 PFU/ml in plasma. samples that were incubated without NT particles were processed using same method. samples were visualized on ChemiDoc instrument from Bio-Rad. VEEV-TC83 was diluted to 2 107 PFU/mL with PBS. blood was collected in EDTA-treated tubes to prevent coagulation. VEEV suspension was mixed well with the same volume of 4% Glutaraldehyde. a drop (8 l) of the glutaraldehyde treated sample was placed on a formvar/carbon coated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid for 10 min in a moist chamber to reduce evaporation. the grid was then washed three times by touching the grid to the surface of drops of deionized water. azine dyes such as cibacron blue and reactive red 120 bind to proteins through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (28). NT particles were mixed with blood-spiked VEEV-TC83 (0.5 mg of NT/ml of sample) and incubated for 30 min prior to determination of viral RNA levels by RT-qPCR. VEEV TC-83 was spiked into human blood followed by incubation with nine different magnetic NT particles (0.5 mg of NT/ml of sample) the genomic copies of VEEV were determined by RT-qPCR after incubation for 30 min in the presence of NT particles. data were evaluated based on western blot analysis of the capsid levels captured from a 1:20 blood:PBS mixture spiked with VEEV. the capsid protein is only detected in samples that have been incubated with CN3080, but not in samples without NT particles regardless of whether virus was spiked into blood or plasma. VEEV-TC83 spiked in DMEM was incubated with NT particles according to the standard protocol. VEEV TC-83 spiked in DMEM was incubated with NT particles according to the standard protocol. heterodimer of VEEV E1 and E2 was depicted with MolBrowser v3.8. subdomains of E1 or E2 were labeled as I, II, III (E1) and A, B, C (E2) VEEV TC-83 was incubated at 22\u00b0C (room temperature), 37, 40, and 54\u00b0C for up to 72 h and viral titer determined by plaque assays. VEEV was incubated at 22\u00b0C (room temperature), 37, 40, and 54\u00b0C for up to 72 h and viral titer determined by plaque assays. only once in four repeats did we observed two plaques developed by virus after 72 h of incubation without NT. the addition of CN3080 in samples may stabilize the VEEV virions. RT-qPCR is a very reliable method and highly sensitive for the detection of minimal amounts of viral nucleic acids. RT-qPCR results indicated preservation of long vRNA in the presence of CN3080 after 72 h of incubation at 40\u00b0C. VEEV TC-83 was spiked in human blood to 1 106 PFU/mL in the presence of CN3080 and incubated up to 96 h at different temperatures. CN3080 effectively preserved VEEV capsid protein in human blood. titers of the blood-spiked VEEV-TC83 were preserved at 16% and 98% humidity when incubating with CN3080 for 72 and 96 h post-incubation. CN3080 preserves infectious VEEV in humid and dry environments. NT particles efficiently stabilize infectious virus at elevated and dry humidity conditions for an extended amount of time. CN3080 preserves and enhances the detectable level of VEEV-TC83 capsid protein in blood of infected mice. mouse blood was collected at day 2, 3, and 4 after intranasal infection with VEEV-TC83. CN3170, CN3160, and CN3080 mixed NT particles with the blood-spiked VEEV-TC83. CN3080 showed the most significant enrichment (bound/unbound = 10, Figure 2A), suggesting that the NT particle conjugated with reactive red 120 chemical bait could be the most suitable. VEEV TC-83 was spiked into blood or plasma at a final concentration 1 106 PFU/mL and incubated with CN3080 (1.25 mg of NT/ml of sample) the level of VEEV capsid protein was determined via western blot analysis. CN3080 magnetic NT particles provide efficient capture of VEEV TC-83 virions over short time periods. the binding efficiency of CN3080 to viral samples can be optimized by adjusting both the incubation time and the NT particle concentration. TEM images were taken and magnification at 25,000X is displayed. we applied docking simulation via the SwissDock website. we determined the free energy of binding (G) toward the affinity bait, reactive red 120, and viral envelope proteins, E1 and E2. NT particles are efficient in the preservation of RVFV and nucleoproteins in biologically relevant matrices. but the effect of NT in the stabilization of virions in a complex matrix such as whole human blood has never been tested before. for this purpose, we spiked 106 PFU of VEEV-TC83 in 0.5 mL of human whole blood. VEEV was diluted and spiked in human blood to 1 106 PFU/mL. blood-spiked VEEV was co-incubated with CN3080 or without CN3080 for 10 min at room temperature and infectious virus determined by plaque assays. data were shown as mean SEM from at least two independent experiments. RT-qPCR is a very reliable method and highly sensitive for the detection of minimal amounts of viral nucleic acids in the patient samples (11) but this method is based on the detection of relatively short fragments of the viral genome and analysis of a longer stretch of viral RNA (vRNA) would provide a more stringent measure of RNA stability. the densitometry analysis of the 1.5 kbp RT-PCR product of the VEEV genome. samples incubated at 40\u00b0C were also analyzed by RT-qPCR. data plotted as mean SEM from two independent experiments. CN3080 was used to assess the preservation efficacy of NT against VEEV capsid protein degradation over 0, 24, 48, and 72 h at 4, 37, and 40\u00b0C. we placed viral samples with or without CN3080 in two incubators with relative humidity at 16 or 98% at 37\u00b0C and incubated them for up to 96 h. CN3080 preserves and enhances the detectable level of VEEV-TC83 capsid protein in blood of infected mice. mouse blood was collected at day 2, 3, and 4 after intranasal infection of VEEV-TC83 mice. CN3080 compared capsid protein stability with or without NT particles. NT particles are made of a hydrogel matrix and can be customized with various affinity baits such as acrylic acid, Cibacron blue dye, and reactive red dye by polymerization (35). magnetic NT particles could simplify workflows allowing the isolation of NT particles in 3\u20135 s instead of long centrifugation steps. a NT particle is potentially bound with dozens of virions, indicating the efficient capturing ability of NT particles. a better way to elute virions needs to be developed to enable more accurate viral titer determination. NT particles can be customized with various affinity baits to bind different microorganisms or biomolecules. the magnetic NT particle presented in this study demonstrated efficient binding affinity to capture one of the biological warfare agents, VEEV. the sensitivity of their detection enhanced via NT particles (36\u201338) the nanoparticles used in this study were research grade and provided by Ceres Nanosciences, Inc. which are not commercially available products. authors declare that Tasso Inc had no role in design of the study and collection, analysis, interpretation of the data or writing of the manuscript. the remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
