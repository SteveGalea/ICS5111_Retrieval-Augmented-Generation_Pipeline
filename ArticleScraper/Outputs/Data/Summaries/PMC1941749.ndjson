{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection causes a progressive atypical pneumonia. most SARS patients recover, suggesting protective immune responses are operational. a strong host response is induced in the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. in the third phase, fatal cases of SARS progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. pathological changes are caused by disproportional immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. however, production of type I IFNs seems to be inhibited or delayed by SARS-CoV in vitro [14\u201318,20\u201322] cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV develop DAD similar to SARS patients, but clear most of the virus in the lungs by day 6. the ability to simultaneously examine virus replication and host response gene expression profiles in the lungs of these animals during the acute phase of SARS offers the opportunity to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS. four mock-infected animals were included in the study to serve as a reference for host response without viral challenge. the level of infection in separate lung samples was evaluated using RT-PCR. no viral RNA could be detected in the samples from the mock-infected animals. RT-PCR was performed on all individual pulmonary samples from SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals and mock-infected animals. the 12 samples from mock-infected animals were pooled and served as a reference sample. the number after PBS refers to the animal (i.e., PBS 1), while the number after the dash refers to the lung piece (i.e., PBS 1-1). there are two major roots to the hierarchical dendrogram. the larger root is composed of all the day 1 samples and the three day 4 samples with the highest virus levels. the smaller root is composed of the remaining day 4 samples with the lowest virus levels. thirty-eight genes are displayed with an absolute fold change > 2 and p 0.0001 in at least two animal samples. only one gene, HLA-DQA1, was down-regulated > 5. no up-regulated genes met these criteria in mock-infected animals. the heat map includes the 597 genes from the grey Venn diagram intersections. all 97 genes are listed in Figure S1. gene expression profiles are the results of comparing gene expression in lungs versus gene expression in lungs of mock-infected animals. the gene expression profile at day 1 shows a prominent innate host response to viral infection. top functional categories on day 1 are the immune response, the hematological system, and the immune and lymphatic system. at day 4, a smaller panel of unique differentially expressed genes were identified. expression of TFPI2 with these pro-coagulation genes might function as an inhibitory response to restrain the activation of the coagulation pathway during acute inflammation. a selection of genes involved in the immune response, cell cycle, or lung repair processes showed an absolute fold change > 5 and p 0.0001 in both day 1 animals. expression of diverse IFN- genes and expression of IFN- was up-regulated 10- to 20-fold in the day 1 samples. suppressor of cytokine signaling 1(SOCS1) is induced at the onset of infection. IFIT1 (ISG56/IFI56), often used to gauge IFN induction, was up-regulated an average of 13-fold. pathogenic and antiviral pathways are induced after SARS-CoV infection. a heat map was created showing all genes with expression changes > 2 and p 0.0001 in at least one of the samples with high SARS-CoV levels (A) and in at least one of the samples with low SARS-CoV levels (B) the heat map is segregated by functional annotations. the induction of IFN- was strongly correlated to the presence of virus (rspearman= 0.88, p 0.0001) for CXCL10 (IP-10), IL-6, and IL-8 the correlation is less evident. RT-PCR was performed on all separate lung samples. expression levels of these genes were plotted against the presence of SARS-CoV. lung sections of infected macaques stained with antibodies against phosphorylated STAT1. phosphorylated STAT1 was not detected in the nucleus of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. translocation of STAT1 does not occur in SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. phosphorylated STAT1 could be detected in the nucleus of most cells. phosphorylated STAT1 could be detected in the nucleus of most cells. MA104 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 24 h. cells were stained for phosphorylated STAT1 and SARS-CoV. cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with strain HKU-39849. RT-PCR was performed on all individual pulmonary samples from SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals and mock-infected animals. mRNA was detected in all animals, and 13 pieces out of the total of 16 lung pieces contained high levels of virus. no viral RNA could be detected in the samples from the mock-infected animals. gene expression in mock-infected animals was compared to gene expression in mock-infected animals. samples 1A and 1B (day 1) and 4A\u20134D (day 4) are composed of the pooled individual pulmonary samples shown in (A) global expression profiling was performed. underlying basal levels of gene transcription do not confound expression levels after infection. underlying basal levels of gene transcription do not confound expression levels. underlying basal levels of gene transcription do not confound expression levels after infection. the day 1 set contained 1,278 genes and the day 4 set contained 950 genes. the heat map of these 597 genes is shown in Figure 3B. both sets of common-response genes showed similar functionality. the Venn diagram shows genes with an absolute fold change > 2 and p 0.0001 in two out of the two day 1 samples or two out of the four day 4 samples. the heat map includes the 597 genes from the grey Venn diagram intersections. all 97 genes are listed in Figure S1. a panel of unique differentially expressed genes that play a role in cell cycle, cellular assembly, and DNA repair were identified. genes that were involved in the immune response, cell cycle, and lung repair processes were queried. a number of genes that have been reported to be up-regulated in SARS patient sera were strongly (20-fold) induced in all animals. genes with an absolute fold change > 5 in both day 1 animals and in at least two of the four day 4 animals are indicated with bold, underlined text. expression of diverse IFN- genes and expression of IFN- was up-regulated 10- to 20-fold in the day 1 samples. a wide range of chemokines and cytokines are differentially expressed after SARS-CoV infection in macaques. we detected monocyte chemotactic protein genes like CCL8 (MCP-2) and CCL7 (MCP-3), but also CCL11 (eotaxin), a chemotactic protein for eosinophils. a heat map was created showing all genes with expression changes > 2 and p 0.0001 in at least one of the samples with high SARS-CoV levels (A), or in at least one of the samples with low SARS-CoV levels (B). genes with an absolute fold change > 5 in two day 1 animals are indicated with bold, underlined text. RT-PCR for IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10 (IP-10), and IFN- was performed on all separate lung samples. expression levels of these genes were plotted against presence of SARS-CoV in these samples (as detected by RT-PCR) no detection of phosphorylated STAT1 (brown) in lungs of mock-infected macaques (40) and (E) abundant presence of phosphorylated STAT1 (brown) in lungs of sARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques at day 1 post infection (40, arrowheads). MA104 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 24 h and then either fixed directly or treated with type I IFN. phosphorylated STAT1 could be detected in the nucleus of most cells, but not in the nucleus of SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. cells were stained for phosphorylated STAT1 and SARS-CoV. the far right panel shows an inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and translocation in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. this study represents the first functional genomics investigation of SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques. the most important aspects of the disease are observed in experimentally infected macaques. this provides valuable insights into the initial innate immune response after infection without confounding clinical treatment or underlying co-morbidity. this strong host response is dominated by genes involved in the immune response. cathepsin L is an endosomal protease necessary for SARS-CoV to infect a cell. IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- (all type I IFNs) were up-regulated, especially on day 1 after infection. expression of IFN-, which strongly correlated to the amount of virus present, continued throughout day 4. pDCs are known for their ability to produce very high amounts of IFN- and IFN- and are considered first-line sentinels in immune surveillance in the lung. future studies may address the nature of these IFN-producing cells once technical difficulties in detecting pDCs in macaques have been tackled. measles virus P protein blocks both of these processes. other paramyxoviruses block activation of STAT1 and STAT2. phosphorylated STAT1 was not detected in SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. prophylactic treatment of cynomolgus macaques with pegylated IFN- protects type 1 pneumocytes from infection with SARS-CoV. macaques infected with the highly pathogenic 1918 influenza virus showed limited induction of type I IFNs and delayed induction of ISGs. a recent study again demonstrated the importance of IFNs in viral infections. despite the fact that SARS-CoV infection blocks the production of IFNs in vitro, type I IFNs are strongly induced in the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. the production of IFN early during infection leads to widespread activation of STAT1 and the production of ISGs. individual lung samples in RNAlater were transferred to TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/) and homogenized using polytron PT2100 tissue grinders. all experiments were executed under a biosafety level 3. ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to functionally annotate genes according to biological processes and canonical pathways. RT-PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV mRNA and validate cellular gene expression changes as detected with microarrays. each reaction was run in triplicate using Taqman 2x PCR Universal Master Mix. -nucleocapsid (Clone Ncap4, mouse IgG2b; Imgenex, http://www.imgenex.com/), mouse-anti-phospho-STAT1 (Clone ST1P-11A5, mouse IgG2a-; Zymed Laboratories, http://www.invitrogen.com/), and rabbit-anti -IFN- (Chemicon, http://www.chemicon.com/) were used SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells were visualized using purified human IgG from a convalescent SARS patient (CSL), followed by staining with an antibody to human IgG. Phosphorylated STAT1 was visualized using mouse-anti-phospho-STAT1 (Zymed), followed by staining with a FITC-linked antibody to mouse IgG. infected macaque lung samples were co-hybridized with reference mock-infected sample. the reference mock-infected sample was created by pooling equal mass quantities of total RNA extracted from the 12 individual lung pieces from mock-infected animals.
