{"summary": "the majority of emerging infectious disease events are caused by zoonotic pathogens, most of which have their origins in wildlife, as SARS or avian influenza do4. the frequency of zoonotic events, where pathogens are transmitted to novel hosts from reservoir species, has increased in recent decades. the current capability of a pathogen to transmit from human to human is of paramount importance8, 9. using simulated data, we first examine the feasibility of obtaining robust estimates of R0 from reported (human) cases. we then apply the method to real case data, estimating the value of R0 in the three largest outbreaks reported for influenza A/H7N9 from china. the first H7N9 case was recorded in Shanghai on 19th February. all live bird markets (LBMs) in Shanghai were closed on 6th April. the line list is available on Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.2g43n). the model could distinguish between human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission when the basic reproductive number was substanitally greater than zero (R0 = 0.6) but still subcritical. Fig. 1A shows that if we assumed the amplitudes and timings of the steps in the spillover hazard were known, our estimates of R0 were tightly constrained around the true value. if the risk of transmission from animals is decreased by culling or market closure, this date is often reported12. histogram of estimated value of R0 when amplitude and timings of the spillover hazard steps are known. when secondary cases are generated using a negative binomial distribution with mean equal to mean equal to R0, and overdispersion parameter 0.1. we simulated 200 time series using an exponential growth of hazard from spillover exposure. we fitted a step-wise spillover hazard function in our analysis. the model generally provides good estimates of the proportion of human-human cases and generates underestimates more often than overestimates. the model with human-to-human transmission had substantially more support than other hazard functions across Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. the model with human-to-human transmission had more support than the animal-to-human-only model for Shanghai and Jiangsu, with both models having similar support for Zhejiang. -39.5 11 124.8 7 step -37.5 13 129.1 Exponential -41.4 5 103.5 Log-normal -38.9 7 106.9 Gamma -39 7 107.1 3 step with H2H -38 6 100.9 Jiangsu 2 step -39.6 3 91.8 3 step -36.4 5 93.7 4 step -35.3 7 99.8 5 step -36.1 9 109.9 6 step -36.4 11 118.9 7 step despite using only case onset data from publicly available sources, these values are consistent with recently published estimates for R0 based on non-public data obtained during subsequent investigations by China CDC14. estimates for R0 and spillover hazard for influenza A/H7N9 in china, assuming a mean serial interval =9.6. the relative patterns in our estimates for R0 and our finding that R0 is below one were unaffected if we assumed a smaller serial interval15, 16, one of 6 days rather than 9.6 days. however, a serial interval of 3 days does increase the estimate of R0 in Zhejiang. top row, serial interval is 3 days; middle row, 6 days; bottom row, 9.6 days. (D), (H) and (F) only 25% of cases observed. only 1% of cases observed. if shape of the spillover hazard was known, we obtained useful information about R0. if shape of the spillover hazard was known, we obtained useful information about R0. we found evidence that around 13% of observed cases in the three largest clusters of influenza A/H7N9 in china in 2013 resulted from human-to-human transmission, rather than from spillover exposure. the peak of our posterior estimates for R0 in Shanghai and Jiangsu is above zero, but for the slightly later epidemic in Zhejiang there is no evidence that R0 is significantly greater than zero. the framework we present has substantial potential value for public health. the approach can be applied to any outbreak of a spillover infection similar to influenza A, and gives a useful upper bound for R0 consistent with the observed onset data."}
