RESULTS Na/K-ATPase expression in LM-3\u20131 cells. a knockdown and rescue protocol yielded multiple viable clones. no 1 signal was detected in LM-3-1 lysates, suggesting that the residual level of pig 1 was even lower in LM-3-1 than in PY-17 cells. 3H-ouabain binding in LM-3-1 was barely detectable. cells were immunostained with anti-Na/K-ATPase 3 primary and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (D) the scale bar represents 25 M (n = 3\u20136). ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ influx was significantly lower in LM-3-1 cells. the number of catalytically competent units that were not transporting ions was higher in LM-3-1 than in AAC-19 cells under normal culture conditions. Na/K-ATPase-mediated 86Rb+ influx substantially increased in both cell lines. clamping intracellular Na+ increased the influx in AAC-19 by 1.83 0.15-fold, which was significantly less than the 2.89 0.15-fold increase observed in LM-3-1 cells. caveolin-1 expression is critical to caveolae structure and influences cell signal transduction (6, 40) caveolin-1 expression is critical for ouabain signaling (45, 52) Knockdown of Na/K-ATPase 1 increases endocytosis and degradation of caveolin-1. -1 cells had increased basal levels of phosphorylation of Src at pY418. basal ERK phosphorylation was increased in LM-3-1 compared with AAC-19. in contrast, there was no statistically significant change in Akt phosphorylation. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. *P 0.05 compared with control. 10 and 100 M ouabain stimulated Src phosphorylation within minutes in LM-3-1 cells. maxim activation at 10 min was apparently reached with 10 M. at the highest concentration of 100 M, a statistically significant inhibition was actually detected. total cell lysates collected from AAC-19 and LM-3-1 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. PI3K is involved in ouabain-induced ERK activation in LM-3-1 cells. LM-3-1 cells were treated with 10 M ouabain for 10 min without pretreatment. this resulted in an increased in basal ERK phosphorylation. but ouabain-induced activation was blunted. total cell lysates were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. materials and methods yielded multiple viable clones. each expressing Na/K-ATPase 3 was named LM-3-1 and selected for subsequent studies. the total amount of 1 polypeptide was assessed by Western blotting analysis. there would be less than 7 104 sites in LM-3-1. there is virtually no expression of Na/K-ATPase 1 in LM-3-1. expression of rat Na/K-ATPase 3 was detected in LM-3-1 lysates. immunostaining revealed that the expressed 3 was fully capable of assembling with 1 into a functional Na/K-ATPase in LM-3-1 cells. 86Rb+ influx was significantly lower in LM-3-1 cells than in AAC-19 cells under normal culture conditions. 3 was 2.3 0.6 mM, comparable (P = 0.4) to that of 1 (11.7 2.2 P 0.05). the Km for Na+ of Na/K-ATPase 3 was 18.41 3.1 mM and significantly higher than that of 1 (11.7 2.2 P 0.05). data are shown as means SE from at least three separate experiments. basal level (A) and basal level (B) and monensin-treated (B) ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ influx was measured. values were normalized per protein amount. whole cell lysates from AAC-19, LM-3-1, and PY-17 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1). a representative Western blot is shown as means SE from at least three separate experiments. 3 NaKtide, like 2 NaKtide (57), does not effectively inhibit Src kinase activity compared with (1-based) NaKtide. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. activation of ouabain is blocked in 1 knockdown PY-17 cells. this activation is restored when PY-17 cells are rescued by the expression of rat Na/K-ATPase 1 (AAC-19 cells) the next series of studies aimed at comparing the effects of ouabain on signaling pathways in LM-3-1 and LM-3-1 cells. LM-3-1 cells were exposed to different concentrations of ouabain. ouabain stimulated ERK but not Src in LM-3-1 cells. 3 may wire signaling partners differently than 1 using a Src-independent signaling process. EGFR inhibitor PD153035 failed to block ouabain-induced ERK activation in LM-3-1 cells. this is consistent with a Src-independent mechanism. ERK can be activated through PI3K and PKC pathways. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. LM-3-1 cells were preincubated in Krebs-Henseleit buffer with (1.8 mM) or without Ca2+ for 30 min and then treated with 10 M ouabain for 10 min. to evaluate the specific enzymatic and signaling functions supported by Na/K-ATPase 3 in a mammalian system, we generated a cell line expressing rat 3 in the absence of a detectable amount of 1. To achieve this goal, we used a knockdown and rescue protocol in which 1 knockdown cells are stably transfected with a ouabain-insensitive rat Na/K-ATPase 3-expressing plasmid. exposure, no 1 signal was detected in LM-3-1 lysates, suggesting that the residual level of pig 1 was even lower in LM-3-1 than in PY-17 cells. the number of counts was less than half of the number detected in PY-17. the scale bar represents 25 M (n = 3\u20136) compared with AAC-19. expression of rat Na/K-ATPase 3 in LM-3-1 was able to rescue expression of glycosylated 1 that is altered in PY-17. Na/K-ATPase activity and ouabain sensitivity in crude membrane preparations from LM-3-1 and LM-3-1 cells were comparable. in contrast, 86Rb+ influx was significantly lower in LM-3-1 cells than in AAC-19 cells under normal culture conditions. we then tested whether Na/K-ATPase from these cells had different apparent affinities for Na+ and K+. clamping intracellular Na+ increased the influx in AAC-19 by 1.83 0.15-fold, which was significantly less than the 2.89 0.15-fold increase observed in LM-3-1. data are shown as means SE from at least three separate experiments. we have shown that Na/K-ATPase 1 associates with caveolin-1 in caveolae. caveolin-1 expression can be rescued by rat Na/K-ATPase 1 expression in AAC-19 (10) caveolin-1 protein content was comparable in AAC-19 and LM-3-1, significantly higher than that in PY-17 cells. basal ERK phosphorylation was increased in LM-3-1 compared with AAC-19. there was no statistically significant change in Akt phosphorylation. a difference in the critical NaKtide sequence between 1 and 3 polypeptides was found. amino acids of 1 NaKtide and 3 NaKtide are in bold and underlined. the amino acids of 3 NaKtide that are different from those of 1 NaKtide are in bold. the precise mechanism underlying the temporal and spatial regulation of transient Src and ERK phosphorylation by ouabain is largely unknown. the precise mechanism underlying the temporal and spatial regulation of transient Src and ERK phosphorylation by ouabain is largely unknown. a representative Western blot is shown, and the quantitative data are means SE from at least three independent experiments. pY418 and c-Src (A), pERK and ERK (B) and pAkt and Akt (C) were pretreated with the PI3K LY 29400 (LY) LM-3-1 cells were treated with 10 M ouabain for 10 min without pretreatment (A) or following preincubation with selected inhibitors as follows: 5 M Src inhibitor PP2 for 30 min (B), 2 M EGFR inhibitor PD153035 (PD) for 60 min (C), 50 M PI3K inhibitor LY 29400 (LY) for 60 min (D), or 1 M PKC inhibitor GO6983 (GO) for 60 min (E) LM-3-1 is the first stable mammalian cell line expressing Na/K-ATPase 3 in the absence of detectable 1. Knockdown of Na/K-ATPase 1 inhibited cell growth in PY-17 cells. restoration of 1 expression rescued growth defect in AAC19 cells. 3 expression conferred signaling properties that were clearly distinct from that of cells expressing Na/K-ATPase 1. difference between cellular Na/K-ATPase-mediated transport in LM-3-1 and AAC-19 in physiological conditions was no longer observed when intracellular Na+ was clamped with monensin. multiple lines of evidence suggest that Na/K-ATPase 1 interacts with Src kinase and regulates its basal activity. support comes from experimental evidence that include coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, in vitro pulldown assays, peptides derived from Na/K-ATPase 1 and gain-of-function/loss-of-function in targeted mutants. phosphorylation of ERK occurs in a Src-independent manner in LM-3-1. the impact of this emerging concept of isoform-specific signaling is yet to be explored. a simple comparison of PY-17, AAC-19, LX-2-4, and LM-3-1 growth rates points to profound effects on cell physiology. studies in mice with altered expression of 3 have shown a correlative link to cognitive deficits (33, 38) and mood disturbances (25, 26) mutations of 3 in patients with rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism (13) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (20) have underlined the clinical importance of Na/K-ATPase 3-specific function.
