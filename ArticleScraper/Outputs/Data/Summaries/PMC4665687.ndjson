{"summary": "patients with severe pneumonia are critically ill. proneto water, electrolyte, acid-base balance disorders may occur. early treatment with antibiotics and supportive therapy is an important measure to improve the prognosis of patients in Intensive Care Units. 34 patients with severe pneumonia, hospitalized at the ICU of the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013, were recruited as research subjects. the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. patients excluded from the study if they had not received antibiotic treatment for their clinical symptoms or had lung lesions with marked absorption. previous history of a serious heart, brain, kidney or vascular disease, or cancer, was used as exclusion criteria. patients excluded if they suffered from an autoimmune disease, or were suffering from an additional infection. blood lactic acid levels of >4 mmol/l, immediate fluid resuscitation, a dose of 20 ml/kg, such as low blood pressure cannot be corrected. all patients received treatment for 6 h to achieve these goals. 34 patients with severe pneumonia, hospitalized at the ICU of the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013, were recruited as research subjects. the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval from the Ethics Committee of Jilin University. patients excluded from the study if they had not received antibiotic treatment for their clinical symptoms or had lung lesions with marked absorption. previous history of a serious heart, brain, kidney or vascular disease, or cancer, was used as exclusion criteria. patients excluded if they suffered from an autoimmune disease, or were suffering from an additional infection. blood lactic acid levels of >4 mmol/l for fluid resuscitation, the central venous pressure (CVP) >8 mmHg, SaO2 >90%, urine level >0.5/ml (kg/h) all patients received treatment for 6 h to achieve these goals. between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013, were recruited as research subjects. the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval from the Ethics Committee of Jilin University. l 5210 528 APACHE II score 22.845.12 23.753.89 APACHE II, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II. patients excluded if they had not received antibiotic treatment for their clinical symptoms or had lung lesions with marked absorption. previous history of a serious heart, brain, kidney or vascular disease was used as exclusion criteria. vocative drugs were applied to maintain mean arterial pressure at >65 mmHg. hypotension or blood lactic acid levels of >4 mmol/l cannot be corrected. all patients received treatment for 6 h to achieve these goals. Fig. 1B indicates that the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was significantly higher when compared with that of the fatality group. however, in the fatality group, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was lower than the normal level and was shown to continually decline. mmol/l lactate clearance rate, % APACHE II score Sepsis incidence, % (n) Survival 4.451.27 29.439.71 14.61.43 30.77 (16/52) Fatality 4.621.43 11.272.61 23.23.9 81.25 (13/16) P-value 0.43 0.01 0.001 0.001 APACHE II, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II. lactate clearance rate in the survival group was significantly higher when compared with the fatality group. incidence of sepsis was significantly lower in the survival group when compared with the fatality group. the differences were statistically significant (P0.05) in the fatality group, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was lower than the normal level and was shown to continually decline. no statistically significant difference was observed in the CRP level of the fatality group at 24, 24 and 72 h. severe pneumonia is defined as respiratory insufficiency, which is caused by tissue hypoxia and metabolic dysfunction (12,13) the pathological basis of severe pneumonia infection is the triggering of inflammatory events, including inflammatory cytokine release. the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) is an important predictor of the prognosis of patients in a critical condition. using dynamic monitoring of the oxygenation index, treatment protocols can be effectively guided, while evaluating the prognosis. oxin or antigen antibody complexes function as activators to activate the release of proinflammatory cytokines. inflammation can be caused by the release of a variety of inflammatory factors. this leads to hypoxia, acidosis-induced pulmonary microvascular contraction and a slow blood supply. the APACHE II score is an indicator of vital signs in the patient response. the higher the score, the more severe the prognosis. however, there may be bias in the data statistics. patients included in the present study were low, the results provide a preliminary basis, and are useful and important data that require confirmation in further studies."}
