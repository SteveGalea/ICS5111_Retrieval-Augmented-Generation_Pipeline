{"summary": "acute viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections are responsible for substantial morbidity in both pediatric and adult populations worldwide. rapid and accurate laboratory detection of respiratory viruses plays an important role in clinical management, guiding the appropriate prescription of antivirals. a virologic diagnosis is instrumental to efforts focused on prevention of health care-associated infections. the samples were originally submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2007 and January 2012. patients from whom specimens had been collected ranged in age from 19 days to 22 years, with a median age of 2.5 years. 67.2% of specimens were from patients under 5 years of age. nineteen characterized enterovirus isolates were obtained from the ATCC. echovirus types 4, 6, 9, 11, and 30; coxsackievirus types A13, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) were also obtained from the ATCC. positive controls were prepared as a mixture of clinical material from previously positive patients. no-template controls were included in each reaction plate for all sets of primers and probes. a human albumin gene primer and probe set (28) was used in separate PCRs as an internal control. a total of 100 l of hybridization buffer containing ferrocene-labeled signal probes specific for the different viral targets was then added to each reaction mixture. if present, target DNA immediately hybridizes to the corresponding signal probes. each cartridge has a preprogrammed memory chip that is read by the instrument. target DNA-signal probe complexes present in the sample hybridize to the capture probes. an electrical current is applied to each electrode, and captured target DNA is analyzed by electrochemical detection using voltammetry. a signal of 3 nA or greater for a given analyte is interpreted as positive. parainfluenza virus type 4 and coronaviruses were not considered discordant between the two methods. the kappa statistic and all confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the VassarStats website for statistical computation. a total of 250 archived respiratory specimens from pediatric patients were used. ovirus serotypes representing groups A (type 12), B (types 3, 7, 11, 14, 21, and 35), C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6), D (types 10, 19, 20, 29, 32, and 37), E (type 4), and F (type 40 and 41) were obtained from either the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, or Adriana Kajon, Infectious Diseases Program, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM negative and negative controls were processed with each batch of clinical specimens from extraction of nucleic acids through the detection of amplified products. negative controls consisted of 1.0 106 cells/ml of an uninfected human lung carcinoma cell line (A549 cells; ATCC CCL-185) negative controls were prepared as a mixture of clinical material from previously positive patients. eSensor XT-8 system and corresponding respiratory viral panel kit tested. panel includes assays for adenovirus groups B, C, and E; coronavirus types 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63. a total of 100 l of hybridization buffer containing ferrocene-labeled signal probes specific for the different viral targets was then added to each reaction mixture. if present, target DNA immediately hybridizes to the corresponding signal probes. each cartridge has a preprogrammed memory chip that is read by the instrument. the final determination of whether a specimen was concordant or discordant was based on an analysis of the initial and repeat test results obtained by both methods. results for viruses not included in the panel of real-time PCR assays but positive by eSensor RVP, i.e., parainfluenza virus type 4 and the coronaviruses, were not considered discordant between the two methods. eSensor RVP generated the same subtype result identified by our laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays in 68 out of the 70 (97.1%) specimens that were positive for influenza A virus. one specimen that was subtyped as influenza A virus seasonal H1 and another subtyped as influenza A virus (H1N1)pdm09 by our laboratory-developed PCR assays were also positive for influenza A virus. 98.3\u2013100 RSV A 24 0 0 226 24/24 (100) 86.2\u2013100 226/226 (100) 98.3\u2013100 PIV type 1 23 0 1 226 23/24 (95.8) 79.8\u201399.3 226/226 (100) 98.3\u2013100 PIV type 2 24 0 0 226 24/24 (100) 86.2\u2013100 226/226 (100) 98.3\u2013100 MPV eSensor RVP based on real-time PCR CT valuesa Virus No. positive by eSensor RVP based on the following real-time PCR CT values. the eSensor RVP was highly specific compared to the real-time PCR assays. all 9 specimens were reproducibly positive for rhinovirus by eSensor RVP but were repeatedly rhinovirus negative by real-time PCR. eSensor RVP was highly specific compared to the real-time PCR assays. 1.44 1010 (10.16) Neg (0.1) Pos (29.72) Coxsackievirus A13 Pos (21.23) 6.01 108 (8.78) Neg (0.5) Pos (38.59) Coxsackievirus B2 Pos (15.83) 2.38 1010 (10.38) Neg (0.1) Pos (31.17) Coxsackievirus B3 Pos (15.18) 9.46 109 (9.98) Neg (0.2) Pos (28.55) Coxsackievirus B4 Pos (15 the relationship between real-time PCR and eSensor RVP nA signal strengths was nonlinear and exhibited variation among viruses. the greatest deviation from linearity was seen for detection of rhinoviruses. eSensor RVP and real-time PCR assaysa Comparative detection of coinfections by eSensor RVP and real-time PCR assaysa Distinct combinations detected by real-time PCR assays Total no. of coinfections No. of discrepant coinfectionsb Discrepant analytes Analyte 1 Analyte 2 Analyte 3 Analyte 4 IV A H1 IV B 1 1 IV the denominator represents the expected number of viral detections. 23 of the adenoviruses were typed by the eSensor assays as belonging to group C, 3 were typed as belonging to group B, and 2 were typed as coming from both groups B and C. six of the 18 eSensor RVP-positive adenovirus serotypes were positive by more than one of the eSensor RVP adenovirus assays. only the group F enteric adenoviruses (types 40 and 41) were not detected at the tested viral loads.
