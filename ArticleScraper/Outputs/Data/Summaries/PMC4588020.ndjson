{"summary": "ME can be classified as granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, or necrotizing leukoencephalitis based on histopathologic features. the pathogenesis of ME can also involve immune-mediated or idiopathic etiologies that provoke aseptic inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. new studies have used multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (mqPCR) as a diagnostic tool for multifactorial diseases. this approach can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens with good diagnostic performance and is faster than conventional methods. the present study was conducted to develop an mqPCR-based diagnostic approach for ME. gypseum (n = 2), aspergillus spp. (n = 3), canine parvovirus (n = 3), canine coronavirus (n = 3), and CDV (n = 6) were identified at Chungbuk National University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) extracted from whole blood in two dogs were used as negative controls. d tube containing zirconia beads, followed by 235 L of lysis/binding solution. the supernatant was then carefully transferred into clean microcentrifuge tubes. the plate was shaken for 1 min on an orbital multi-well-plate shaker at maximum speed without spilling the sample. mqPCR panel Primers and probes were categorized as mqPCR A, B, C, and D. each reaction contained a non-specific 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence flanked by the uvrC gene sequence of Mycobacterium (M.) bovis to minimize cross-reactivity with M. bovis. sensitivity was assessed for each pathogen in triplicate as a singleplex assay. the reaction for E. canis was performed using the same regents and PCR conditions as the multiplex panel. Biological materials and vectors Type strains of C. neoformans (ATCC 32045), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213, 33592, BAA-44, BAA-41, and BAA-1683), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Malassezia pachydermatis (ATCC 14522) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; USA) synthetic oligonucleotides were cloned into a T-Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (SolGent, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. each recombinant vector was prepared in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled water as a series of 10-fold serial dilutions. mqPCR panel Primers and probes were categorized as mqPCR A, B, C, and D. each reaction included two primer/probe sets for the target pathogen, one primer/probe set for the IC, and a reference dye. PCR amplification was conducted using an Eco Real-Time PCR system (Illumina, USA) the Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for PCR A, and the QuantiTect Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, USA) kit was used for PCR B, C, and D according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols. all dogs with ME presented with non-specific neurological symptoms, such as seizure, incoordination, or altered consciousness. criteria included evidence of focal or multifocal brain lesions during neurological examination without signs of spinal cord lesions or lesions in the peripheral nervous system. mqPCR panel and singleplex PCR for each pathogen were compared directly to identify any negative effects of multiplexing on PCR detection. the results of singleplex and multiplex PCR were identical except for CDV, and CT differences between PCR reactions were not significant. using the Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) was slightly lower than that obtained with the QuantiTect Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen); however, the difference in CT was less than 1 suggesting that the kits had comparable performance. mqPCR did not falsely detect normal CSF constituents as target materials. canine distemper virus, Ehrlichia (E.) canis, Bartonella spp., Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi, Blastomyces (B.) dermatitidis, Cryptococcus (C.) neoformans, Neospora (N.) caninum, and Toxoplasma (T.) gondii. mqPCR panel and singleplex PCR for each of the eight path CSF sample analysis Of the 47 CSF samples obtained from dogs diagnosed with ME, seven (15%) were positive for the target pathogen. conventional CSF analysis and culture was negative for all pathogens. mqPCR did not falsely detect normal CSF constituents as target materials. histopathology can be used to classify ME based on the tissue manifestations of the disease. however, treatment is not specific for the ME subtype. the prevalence of neurologic infections causing ME in dogs has been underestimated. this is the first report to implicate B. dermatitidis in canine ME in Korea. two cases positive for B. burgdorferi had a history of ixodid tick infestation. in both cases, the locations of CNS lesions included the choroid plexus. would be useful for selecting an appropriate treatment in a timely manner."}
