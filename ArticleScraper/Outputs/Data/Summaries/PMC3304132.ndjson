{"summary": "the reporter construct usually consists of a promoter (enhancer) that drives the transcription of a gene that is easily detected by its activity or expression in the assay system. the promoter region binds transcription factors that are activated in response to the stimulation of an upstream, receptor-mediated or receptor-independent signaling cascade. bioassays are used to determine the concentration or biological activity of molecules such as hormones, growth factors, and enzymes. they can be used for measuring the effects of candidate drugs on an organism, cultured cells, or recombinant receptors by comparison to gold standard molecules with known target activity. ferase enzymes have been cloned from several species. firefly luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of firefly luciferin. this produces a short-lived flash of light that decays within a few seconds. but the sensitivity of the luciferase assay is significantly higher than CAT. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) is a bacterial enzyme that is not expressed in eukaryotes. CAT catalyzes the reaction between acetyl-CoA and chloramphenicol to form CoA. the CAT assay has been widely used but is difficult to adapt to HTS platforms. the high sensitivity of luciferase-based bioluminescence assays is better suited to HTS platforms than CAT or -Gal assays. various luciferase substrates are available that have a long half-life and provide linear results over eight orders of magnitude. green fluorescent protein (GFP) is particularly suited to bioimaging assays in living cells or live animals. the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter system has been used to investigate the activity of known or putative promoter/enhancer elements. it is a truncated mutant of the membrane-anchored, placental alkaline phosphatase. expression of the gene can be detected using chemiluminometry. both SEAP and MetLuc are currently available in a commercial dual reporter system. the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter system has been successfully applied in drug screening research. it has several important advantages over other reporters. idia longa has unique secretary features that make it suitable for extracellular reporter assays. the secreted MetLuc is well suited to monitoring gene expression in time-course reporter assays. both are currently available in a commercial dual reporter system. research is being conducted using living animals to monitor the more complex dynamics of hit compounds identified by screening. the ERE\u2013Luc (estrogen responsive element\u2013luciferase gene) mouse is the first example of a reporter animal to be used for drug discovery. time-course assay is suitable for extra-cellular reporters compared to intra-cellular reporters. an in vivo imaging system is needed to detect luciferase and GFP. a tissue specific transgenic mouse is needed to detect specific tissue expression of extra-cellular reporters. the DFCR-REs were isolated from long-lived mice. the unidentified transcriptional regulators of this sequence may be beneficial for longevity and delay the onset of age-related diseases. CR mimetics may suppress and/or delay the progression of various kinds of age-related diseases. academic laboratories are perfectly placed to develop drugs for rare diseases using phenotypic cell- or animal-based reporter assay systems. CR mimetics offer great potential to solve unmet medical needs of rare diseases and common age-related disorders."}
