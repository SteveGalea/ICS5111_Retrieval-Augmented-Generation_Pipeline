{"summary": "aromatase is an important target for drugs to treat hormone-dependent diseases, including breast cancer. aim of this study was to develop a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) aromatase assay suitable for high-throughput screening. aromatase is encoded by the cyp19a1 gene4,5. it belongs to a particular reticulum-bound cytochrome P450 superfamily. it forms an electron-transfer complex with its partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) aromatase is a rate-limiting enzyme of great importance that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of androstenedione (4A) and testosterone into estrogen steroidal AIs covalently bind to aromatase, resulting in irreversible inhibition. non-steroidal AIs include anastrozole, vorozole, and letrozole. homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)25,26 technology is an immunoassay based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a tris-bipyridine europium cryptate used as a long-lived fluorescent donor and a chemically modified allophycocyanin used as acceptor27. this technology has been documented to be a sensitive and reliable method for the HTS of diverse enzyme and receptor targets. assay development and optimization Enzyme reactions were conducted for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in white 384-plates. 5 L of estradiol-XL665 conjugate and anti-estradiol cryptate conjugate were added 2 h before reading the plate. the EC80 was calculated using PRISM version 5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc, CA, USA) from the non-linear curve fitting of the delta F% (fluorescence increasing percent) value versus the inhibitor concentration. Approximately 7000 compounds (10 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO) from the compound library of the national Nanjing Center for Drug Screening were plated into white 384-plates. tase in the enzyme reaction solution replaced by assay buffer) values. max and min are average HTRF ratio values of the high control and low control. % inhibition=(Ratiocompoundneg)/(maxneg)100. 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin, grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were steroid deprived using RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS for 3 d. each concentration was tested in triplicate. CYP19+P450 reductase supersomes were purchased from BD Biotech (CA, USA) an HTRF estradiol kit was purchased from BD Biotech (CA, USA) anti-estradiol cryptate diluted in reconstitution buffer (50 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.8 mol/L KF, 0.2% BSA) was measured at 620 nm and 665 nm using an Envision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) with a 100 s delay. data were converted from HTRF ratio values to delta F%. a hit was defined as a compound that displayed 50% inhibition in the primary screening. the hits selected from the primary screen were serially diluted. the IC50 was calculated using PRISM version 5.0 software. the active compound XHN27, the natural isoflavone product BCA30 and the extensively used aromatase inhibitor, letrozole were docked into the active site of aromatase to determine their preferential conformations. the top 10 conformations were generated for each ligand based on the docking score after energy minimization using the smart minimizer method. the proliferation assay was performed using the alamarBlue\u00ae assay. the inhibition rate was calculated using the following formula: % inhibition=[1(RFUsampleRFUblank)/(RFUnegativeRFUblank)]100. estradiol was detected by the binding of homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) donor anti-estradiol antibody conjugated with cryptate to d 2 acceptor conjugated estradiol. HTRF signals generated by increasing amount of testosterone in the presence and absence of 15 nmol/L aromatase. the detection time was set at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min. activity of aromatase was raised with the increasing concentration of NADPH (0.3 nmol/L to 10 000 nmol/L) letrozole was dissolved in DMSO to make a stock solution of 10 mmol/L. a representative concentration-response curve of letrozole was plotted using PRISM version 5.0 software. HTRF signal in the presence of known aromatase inhibitors, letrozole. three flavone derivatives share the chemical skeleton of imidazolyl quinoline. IC50 against aromatase of 1.600.07 mol/L, 2.760.24 mol/L, and 0.810.08 mol/L. other confirmed hit, TQA, was less potent compared with XHN27. letrozole was a more potent inhibitor of cell proliferation than XHN27 and BCA. inhibition rate of letrozole (3 mol/L) was 54.6% after 6 d. XHN27 at 50 mol/L was 45.3%, and 35.2% at 10 mol/L. exogenous E2 was able to rescue the anti-proliferation effects of 3, 10, and 50 mol/L XHN27 on T47D cells. inhibition rates decreased from 45.3% in 4A-treated cells to 24.4% in E2-treated cells after administration with 50 mol/L XHN27 for 6 d. the 22-nitrile and 20-nitrile of letrozole form two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of ser 478 and the amide of Met 374 respectively. the triazole of letrozole forms a \u2013 stacking interaction with the porphyrin ring and a -cation interaction with the Fe atom. letrozole would tightly bind in the pocket instead of 4A. the methoxy in the B-ring provides low affinity with the side chains of Phe 134, leu 372, and Met 374. a docking conformation of XHN27 conforms to the binding pocket of aromatase and forms key hydrogen bonds between its 4'-F and the amide of Met 374 and the NH- of Arg 115. orophore employed minimizes fluorescence interference due to buffers or test compounds. HTRF estradiol detection method was used in determining aromatase activity. HTRF signals generated by increasing amount of testosterone in presence and absence of 15 nmol/L aromatase. the detection time was set at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min. the HTRF assay is a potentially robust assay that can be used to determine the potency of aromatase inhibitors. letrozole was dissolved in DMSO to make a stock solution of 10 mmol/L, and the solution was serially diluted using assay buffer. the secondary screening resulted in 4 confirmed hits, XHN22, XHN26, XHN27, and triptoquinone A (TQA) three of the 4 compounds share the chemical skeleton of imidazolyl quinoline (Figure 5) and had an IC50 against aromatase of 1.600.07 mol/L, 2.760.24 mol/L, and 0.810.08 mol/L, respectively. values are represented as meanSEM of three independent experiments (n=3). analysis of selected hits to inhibit cell proliferation rates. inhibition rate of letrozole was 54.6% after 6 d. significant differences between the E2-treated cells versus 4A-treated cells after administration with XHN27 are denoted by bP0.05, cP0.01. exogenous E2 was able to rescue the anti-proliferation effects of 3, 10, and 50 mol/L XHN27 on T47D cells following treatment for 6 d. inhibition rates decreased from 45.3% in 4A-treated cells to 24.4% in E2-treated cells after administration with 50 mol/ the residues comprising the catalytic cleft are Ile 305, Ala 306, Asp 309 and Thr 310, Phe 221, Trp 224, Ile 133, Phe 134, Val 370, Leu 372, Val 373, Met 374, Leu 477, and Ser 478. the 22-nitrile and 20-nitrile of letrozole form two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of ser 478 and the amide of the two hydroxyl groups in the A-ring and the adjacent carboxyl group of the C-ring may attenuate the hydrophobic interaction between them. the methoxy in the B-ring provides low affinity with the side chains of Phe 134, leu 372, and Met 374, ascribed to steric factors. however, the \u2013 stacking interaction between the A-ring, C-ring, and benzene ring of Trp 224 strengthen the binding of B ase enzyme heme moiety and preventing androgen binding are a successful alternative to tamoxifen as a first-line therapy in postmenopausal women. however, several clinical trials in postmenopausal breast cancer patients and healthy postmenopausal women treated with AIs evaluated the risks of bone fractures. the optimal aromatase amount was determined to be 0.15 pmol/well. it was confirmed that the aromatase reaction required cofactor NADPH as hydrogen donor. the EC80 of 600 nmol/L NADPH was used as a standard condition in our assay. XHN27 is an ER-positive breast cancer cell line that demonstrates increased cell proliferation in response to estrogen32. this study demonstrated that XHN27 exhibits promising inhibitory action against breast cancer, better than BCA, and may be a promising aromatase inhibitor candidate. XHN27 was the most potent among the three imidazolyl quinoline derivatives of flavone due to electronic and steric factors. the 4-nitryl of XHN26 was sterically bulky and the 4- methoxy of XHN22 was less electronegative. this suggests that XHN27 exhibits a potent inhibitory action. the interactions between XHN27 and aromatase included a hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond and -cation connection. the lack of a covalent bond between 4-imidazolyl and heme iron due to the opposite conformation may indicate that the interaction was competitive and reversible. delta F%, fluorescence increasing percent; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EC80, concentration for 80% of maximum effect; EDTA, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid; ER, estrogen receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HTRF, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescent; HTS, high-throughput screening; IC50, half maximal inhibitory concentration; KF, potassium fluoride; NADPH,"}
