{"summary": "coVs are associated with respiratory disease, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to those that are more severe and potentially fatal, associated with infection of the lower-respiratory tract. coVs are also known to infect mammals and birds, among which they have been associated with enteric and respiratory diseases. in total, 899 tissue samples from 813 wild rodents and shrews from the east Midlands region of the united kingdom and the Mazury Lake District region of Poland were collected. a necropsy was performed and tissue samples were stored at 70 \u00b0C in ethanol (Polish liver specimens), at 70 \u00b0C in RNAlater (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; UK liver and gut specimens) a total of 300 samples were collected from three sites (Site 1: 53\u00b047.7 N 21\u00b0 39.6 W, Site 2: 53\u00b053.5 N 21\u00b0 32.4 W, Site 3: 53\u00b042.3 N 21\u00b0 48.8 W) one of the positive samples was positive for coronaviruses. extra sequence for ORF1ab was acquired by using an in-house primer targeting an upstream conserved region. PCR products of expected size were subject to Sanger sequencing. sequence similarity to Genbank database sequences was determined using BLASTn. results and discussion Eleven of the 813 rodents and shrews tested were found to be positive for CoVs. one lineage contained a single sequence that was present in five separate samples (UKRn1-5) obtained from Rattus norvegicus. a separate cluster with 100% bootstrap support contained three sequences. a third branch contained a sequence obtained from Myodes glareolus (PLMg1) and a further distinct sequence obtained from Sorex araneus (UKSa1) and Microtus agrestis (UKMa3). re-extraction of the original rodent tissues gave identical results. this strongly suggests that contamination did not occur during nucleic acid extraction or PCR preparation. the inability of ORF1ab PCR sequencing to resolve different isolates was evident in recent analyses of bat CoVs [20,21] numbers above individual branches indicate the percentage that that branch was found in 1000 bootstrap replicates. reference sequences representing rodent and shrew cytochrome b sequences indicated by their Genbank Accession Number. comparisons were made using unique nucleotide sequences. the sequences described in the bat analyses represented a shorter fragment of the ORF1ab gene. there was no evidence that the UK/European rodents were directly related to those present in bats. scale analyses of coV infection of european mammal populations need to be performed to fully understand their evolutionary history. the study has shown the first evidence of alphacoronaviruses present in European rodents and shrews demonstrating that rodent and shrew coronaviruses sampled to date, from worldwide locations. is required for better understanding of genetic diversity, host range and cellular receptors."}
