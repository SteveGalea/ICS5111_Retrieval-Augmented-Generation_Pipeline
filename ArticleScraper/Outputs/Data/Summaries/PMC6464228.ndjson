{"summary": "mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract are the first line of defense to prevent the infection of pathogens and clear the evaded microorganism by excreting active components including secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) the first sign of mycoplasma infection raises the strategy considerations about the induction of SIgA by vaccination. cathepsin L (CTSL) is involved in the late stage of Ii degradation. it has also been implicated in regulatory events relating to immunological responses. recent studies revealed that CLIK148, a specific inhibitor of CTSL, enhances the development of Th2-type immune responses. animals were anaesthetized with atropine (0.05 mg/kg), ketamine (5 mg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg), which were provided by Veterinary Hospital of China Agricultural University before experiments. all efforts were used to reduce the pain and adverse effect of the animals. incubated in 150 l buffer solution (10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.1M NaH2PO4, pH 5.5) the fluorescence signal liberated by hydrolysis was detected using a spectrofluorometer. the enzymatic activity was expressed as the increased fluorescence units/min during incubation.

RPMI-1640 complete medium with 20 ng/ml rpGM-CSF, 25 g/ml of rpIL-4, 50 g/ml IFN- and 50 g/ml CD40L were added. in group 1, cells were treated with rCTSL protein for 1 h followed by infection with M.hp 3r-CACCTGCCTGAATTCTTCATTGG constructed the plasmid px458-253r used for the knockdown CTSL by the methods described in manufacturer's instructions. cells were transfected with 10 l of Lipofectamine 2000 in 240 l RMPI 1640 (GIBCO) containing conditional vectors. eighteen piglets confirmed to be M.hp free by antibody detection were randomly divided into three groups. control group was six pigs injected intratracheally with 3 ml of phosphate buffered saline. rCTSL+M.hp group was six pigs which first injected via bronchofiberscopy with 20 g of rCTSL protein and then challenged with 3ml of PBS containing 5107 CCU of M.hp stained sections were blindly evaluated by a veterinary pathologist. the distribution and severity of interstitial pneumonia were recorded. the other sections were subjected to detect CTSL and MHC class II respectively. the surface markers of DCs were CD11b+ CD14+ CD21+ CD1+ CD163+ for immature cells at 3 d and CD11b+ SLA-DR+ CD173+ for mature cells at 8 d after stimulated with LPS. before co-culture, immature Mo-DCs and B cells were harvested by MACS and purity was 95.26%. in the co-cultured cells, the levels of CTSL conditional knockdown after CTSL transfected with 1.5 or 2 g CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid px458-253r. the concentrations of SIgA decreased about 50% and 75% accordingly since the level of CTSL decreased. CTSL concentration increased when DCs+B cells were treated with 30 g rCTSL or 2.0 g CTSL-GFP. CTSL regulated cytokines secretion in DCs+B cells TGF- and IFN- had been up-regulated significantly when CTSL accumulated in DCs+B cells which infected with M.hp. protein or CTSL-GFP eukaryotic plasmid had a significant increase. concentration decreased when treated with inhibitor E64 or px458-253r. concentration decreased when CTSL was inhibited or knockdown. Ii intermediates, LIP, SLIP and p10 accumulated when cells were treated with 10 g E64 or transinfected with 2 g px458-253 vector first and incubated with M.hp later. CTSL were overexpressed in lung and trachea samples when pigs infected with M.hp. concentrations of CTSL in lungs and tracheas rose nearly 3 fold at 21 DPI. this coincides with the change in SIgA. piglets treated with rCTSL before challenge showed slight symptoms. histopathological damage of lungs was mild with slight thicker alveolar septa and fewer cilia lost at 21 DPI. rCTSL protected pigs from M.hp infection. live mycoplasma in lungs was lower in rCTSL+M.hp group than in rCTSL+M.hp group. cilia appeared sparse and aggregated after M.hp infection. concentrations of SIgA in BALFs rose over 4 fold at each time point. the level of SIgA significantly increased at 14 and 21 DPI when treated with rCTSL, and higher than M.hp group. data represent means SEM from three independent experiments. phenotype was CD19+ CD20+ CD4lowSLA-DRlow at 3 d and CD19+ CD20+ CD21+ CD14+ CD172a+ for mature cells at 8 d after stimulated with LPS. before co-culture, immature Mo-DCs and B cells were harvested by MACS and purity was 95.26%. levels of CTSL conditional knockdown after CTSL transfected with 1.5 or 2 g plasmid px458-253r. concentrations of SIgA decreased about 50% and 75% accordingly. CTSL increased significantly in the DCs+B cells treated with 30 g rCTSL or transfected with 2.0 g CTSL-GFP. plasmid CTSL-GFP increased significantly when DCs+B cells were treated with 30 g rCTSL or 2.0 g CTSL-GFP. data represent means SEM from three independent experiments. CTSL regulated cytokines secretion in DCs+B cells TGF- and IFN- had been up-regulated significantly when CTSL accumulated in DCs+B cells which infected with M.hp. IL-6 and IL-10 showed significant differences among the three cell types. data are representative of three independent experiments. we analyzed the kinetics of Ii degradation and accumulation of Ii intermediates in cell models under different conditions. SIgA and CTSL were induced coincidently in pigs by challenge with M.hp. SIgA rose over 4 fold from 7 d to 14 d and remained around 15 g/ml at 21 DPI. in serum, nearly no IgG and IgM were detected. plasma specific-Ig measured by complete ELISA was significantly higher in M.hp infection group than control. piglets treated with rCTSL before challenge showed slight symptoms. live mycoplasma scores were lower at 21 and 28 DPI in rCTSL+M.hp group than in rCTSL+M.hp group. titer of live mycoplasma also decreased to 105.75 and 104.5 at 21 and 28 DPI separately after treated with rCTSL. rCTSL could provide effective protections for piglets against M.hp infection. the concentrations of SIgA in BALFs rose over 4 fold at each time point. they almost doubled by treatments with rCTSL in addition to challenge. rCTSL enhanced the mucosal immune response to M.hp infection. antigen-specific SIgA induced by pathogens or vaccines is a first-line defense. in airways, antigen-specific SIgA is released by epithelial cells. the latter originates from the B cells underwent IgA class-switch recombination. in vitro studies with human and mouse cells have shown that the interaction between B cells and DCs is required to achieve a successful IgA class switch. DCs play a critical role in B cell development and B lymphocytes have an important regulatory effect on the Ag-presenting function of DCs in vitro and in vivo. CTSL is widely distributed in a variety of tissues and plays critical roles in a variety of biological processes. the identity between CTSL and Cat S, Cat K was only 56.4% and 58.7% respectively in Sus scrofa. pig is an ideal animal model to study the roles of CTSL in immune responses to mycoplasma infection. CTSL and cat V/L2 were shown not to participate in Ii-p10 processing in human epithelial cell line HeLa-CIITA and MelJuSo systems expressing Ii chain and HLA-DR. cat S is the only cysteine protease able to efficiently process the human p10 fragment in vivo. CTSL facilitated apoptosis in macrophages and neutrophils and TLR9-mediated signaling. results of the experiments showed that CTSL activity is increased in alveolar septum, alveoli, tracheas and lungs in association with the inflammatory response after infection. rCTSL provided considerable defense against infection as manifest by reduced lung lesion scores and bacteria burden. a general down-regulation of cathepsin expression in infected cells, and inhibited mature and increase of CTSL. CTSL provides obvious protection against M.hp for pigs through promoting mucosal immune with definite actions on facilitating MHC class II peptide presentation. (15KB, docx) S5 Methods.
