{"summary": "the top 100 most stably expressed genes with a broad range of expression levels were identified. we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a subset of 10 genes (TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, FARP1, MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT) the current, most universally used normalization method for PCR and Northern blotting relies on the use of constitutively expressed endogenous reference genes. it has been shown that the expression of such reference genes can vary significantly between different tissues or conditions, thus making it impossible to use the same reference genes for various tissues. Affymetrix human 2.0 Plus arrays surveyed over 54,000 probe-sets. the 54,000 probe-sets represent over 39,500 potential human genes. qRT-PCR cDNA synthesis was performed at the Lucy Whittier Molecular and Diagnostic Core Facility. the following cDNA synthesis protocol was validated using a variety of sample types and species. 10 l (750 ng) of template RNA per sample, 1 l gDNA WipeOut Buffer, 1 l RNase-free water was incubated at 42\u00b0C for two minutes. real-time TaqMan\u00ae PCR Pre-validated gene expression assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems. an aliquot of the cDNA from a subset of samples was TaqMan\u00ae analyzed with human GAPDH prior to profiling. internal control genes stability measures (M) is defined as the average pair-wise variation of a particular control gene with all other control genes. stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M value is performed. the optimal number of control genes for normalization is determined by calculating the pair-wise variation Vn/Vn+1 between each set of two sequential normalization factors. the input data were the normalized data to the geometric average of the optimal set of control genes (TRAP1, DECR1, PPIB, and HMBS) using the comparative Ct method. TRAP1, identified by GeNorm as one of the two most stably expressed genes was used as a normalizer. qRT-PCR cDNA synthesis was performed at the Lucy Whittier Molecular and Diagnostic Core Facility (University of California, Davis, U.S.A.) the following cDNA synthesis protocol was validated through the Lucy Whittier Molecular and Diagnostic Core Facility. a 1 L aliquot was TaqMan\u00ae analyzed with human GAPDH to confirm all gDNA had been digested. 8 l from the reverse transcription reaction mix was added to each well, incubated at 42\u00b0C for 40 minutes, inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes. samples were analyzed with human GAPDH prior to profiling. samples were placed in a 384 well plate and amplified in an automated fluorometer. the optimal number of control genes for normalization is determined by calculating the pair-wise variation Vn/Vn+1 between each set of two sequential normalization factors. a normalization factor is calculated based on the geometric mean of the optimal set of control genes for normalization. the normalizer and the gene of interest have very similar amplification efficiency. the standard deviation (SD) of the technical duplicates was 1.41 (or higher than 2-fold change) was considered missing data points. the minimum number of genes for which the V was smaller than 0.15 was used to define the optimal set of control genes for normalization. a normalization factor is calculated based on the geometric mean of the optimal set of control genes. the input qRT-PCR results were the linearized quantities (2-Ct) patients and samples Of the 526 samples, the mean ages of the subjects for each study varied from age 4 (autism study patients and controls) to age 68 (stroke study patients) with a range of 2 to 78 years of age. control subjects had no known medical, surgical, or psychiatric illnesses. the average log2-intensity (x-axis) of 39,500 genes from a total of 526 microarrays is plotted against the standard deviation of the log2-intensity (y-axis) of those genes. sample-sets highlighted in red are the 100 probe-sets with the lowest standard deviation within an interval of the log2-transformed intensity values between 5 and 10. from them, 10 candidate genes were selected for validation with, on average, two genes per intensity interval gene Symbol ABI Assay ID GenBank ID Gene Name FARP1 Hs01120587_m1 BF213279 FERM, RhoGEF (ARHGEF) and pleckstrin domain protein 1 (chondrocyte-derived) CRY2 Hs00901393_m1 AB014558 cryptochrome 2 (photolyase-like) average expression calculated from 526 Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus microarrays. gray columns represent the candidate control genes selected from Figure 1. white columns represent commonly used house-keeping genes and PPIB. stably expressed genes covered a wide range of expression levels. expression levels ranged from 17.9 Ct for B2M to low levels of 35.71 Ct for FARP1. qRT-PCR on multiple sclerosis patients and normal controls. qRT-PCR was performed on RNA samples from 20 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 20 age and gender matched controls. the average expression and its standard deviation was calculated for each gene for all of the patients combined (n = 40). the average expression stability (M) for those reference genes which showed SD of raw Ct-values 1.0 on all samples was calculated using the GeNorm tool. process nucleoside metabolic process folic acid and derivative biosynthetic process nucleotide binding Tetrahydrofolylpoly- glutamate-synthase activity ATP binding ligase activity cytoplasm mitochondrion cytosol TRAP1 TNF receptor-associated protein 1 protein folding nucleotide binding receptor activity tumor necrosis factor receptor binding ATP binding. TRAP1 and FPGS were the most stably expressed genes in whole blood of patients with MS. gender and age matched controls were analyzed using qRT-PCR. RNA samples from whole-blood from 20 MS patients and 20 matched controls were analyzed using qRT-PCR. analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the qRT-PCR data. expression of the remaining genes did not differ significantly between the matched pairs. no significant p-values (p 0.05) for plate, nor for the Diagnosis-versus-plate interaction were found. t Method Comparative Ct Method Normalized to TRAP1 Normalized to Optimal Set of 4 Genes* Gene Fold Change (MS/H) Fold Change (MS/H) p-value (Diagnosis) FPGS 1.08 1.00 0.964 ACTb 1.08 ND 0.788 GINS2 1.21 1.11 0.691 HMBS 1.12 1.06 0.581 B2M -1.04 -1.10 0.575 FARP1 1.34 1.16 patients and samples Of the 526 samples, the mean ages of the subjects for each study varied from age 4 (autism study patients and controls) to age 68 (stroke study patients) there was a predominance of males (387) to females (139). the average log2-intensity of 39,500 genes from a total of 526 microarrays is plotted against the standard deviation of the log2-intensity (y-axis) of those genes. sample-sets highlighted in red are the 100 probe-sets with the lowest standard deviation within an interval of the log2-transformed intensity values. the SDs for the remainder genes (open bars, B2M, ACTB, GAPDH, PPIB and HMBS) ranged between 0.47 and 0.72 on the microarrays. a general trend of increasing SD with increasing intensity was noted. qRT-PCR analysis and expression of candidate control genes is calculated from the 526 Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus microarrays for the candidate control genes selected for qRT-PCR validation. gray columns represent the candidate control genes selected from Figure 1. MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, ACTB, GAPDH, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT did not show stable expression over the samples. the stably expressed genes covered a wide range of expression levels, from a high level of expression of 17.9 Ct for B2M, to low levels of 35.71 Ct for FARP1. expression (average raw Ct, x axis) is plotted versus Standard Deviation of average raw Ct (y axis) for all of the candidate control genes. qRT-PCR was performed on RNA samples from 20 multiple sclerosis patients. the average expression and its standard deviation was calculated for each gene for all of the patients combined (n = 40) yglutamate synthase nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process glycine metabolic process biosynthetic process nucleoside metabolic process folic acid and derivative biosynthetic process nucleotide binding Tetrahydrofolylpoly- glutamate-synthase activity ATP binding ligase activity cytoplasm mitochondrion cytosol TRAP1 T a step-wise exclusion of the least stable reference gene shows that B2M was the least stable. TRAP1 and FPGS were the most stably expressed genes in whole blood of patients with MS and gender and age matched controls. the most stable gene was TRAP1 (stability value 0.066), followed by FPGS (0.067), DECR1 (0.078), PPIB (0.079), HMBS (0.095) and B2M (0.108). the main differences between the GeNorm algorithm (reference) and the model-based variance estimation approach in NormFinder is that the latter takes into account the inter- and intra-group variation. the highest deviation from the 1.0 ratio for all the genes was observed for CSNK1G2 as expected.

TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, and FARP1 showed the most stable expression. this is essential if the microarray, RT-PCR or Northern blotting platform is non-linear at very low or at very high levels. having a set of endogenous reference genes that are stably expressed at different levels makes it possible to help select those whose expression is comparable to the target genes. the proposed endogenous reference genes for whole blood have not been demonstrated in this study. it should be emphasized that the ultimate usefulness of the proposed endogenous reference genes for whole blood has not been demonstrated in this study.
