{"summary": "a DNA molecule was synthesized in vitro from oligonucleotides representing the text of the first tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) sequence elucidated in 1982. no infectious DNA molecule of that seminal reference sequence exists. RNA was transcribed from synthetic DNA and encapsidated with capsid protein in vitro to make synthetic virions. two variant RNA sequences of TMV (GenBank V01408.1 and V01409.1) were deduced by Goelet et al. in 1982. the virus encodes at least four proteins (Figure 1). a fifth, 54 kDa protein, predicted as the difference between the two replicase components, has an undefined virological role if any. the Goelet sequence does not represent a single molecule of a TMV genome. it is a composite consensus of more than 400 independent clones of cDNA fragments reverse transcribed from a population of TMV RNA molecules exhibiting nucleotide polymorphisms. it is the likelihood that the virus that Goelet et al. sequenced was a mixture of closely related strains [13] the complete chemical synthesis of a plant virus genome has not yet been reported. DNA was synthesized from overlapping oligonucleotides based on the Goelet alphabetic rendering of TMV. the man-made virus particles encoding the Goelet sequence, a mutant thereof, and two viral chimeras were tested in plants. 7-Methyl guanosine capped-RNA was transcribed in vitro from gel purified PCR product of 1-30 and was inoculated to Nicotiana tabacum cv. the same amounts of RNA from DNA made by PCR amplification of the control plasmid pFL-TMV-NA, a known infectious TMV cDNA clone expressed by a T7 promoter, did produce local lesions on NN tobacco pFL-TMV-NA contains substitutions that add restriction endonuclease sites NdeI before the MP start codon and AflII before the MP stop codon. pFL-TMV-NA contains substitutions that add restriction endonuclease sites NdeI before the MP start codon and AflII before the MP stop codon. the MR polymorphism is suspicious because it arises in the Goelet sequence from an insertion and deletion event rather than the more prevalent single nucleotide substitution. the MR sequence from amino acids 166 to 207 was compared to the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database by BLASTP. cDNAs amplified from local lesions encoded CE amino acids. but they did not contain the G to A polymorphism at nucleotide position 832. the virus causing the symptoms was derived from the synthetic 1-34CE-30 DNA molecule. chimera synthetic virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 produced local lesions on Xanthi NN within 5 days and mosaic symptoms on Xanthi SX within 7 days. chimera synthetic virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 produced local lesions on Xanthi NN within 5 days. the rapid systemic infection in SX indicated that the ToMV CP complemented long-distance transport function. transmission electron microscopy confirmed toMV CP encapsidation of the chimera virus progeny in Xanthi SX. peptides identified from plants by tandem mass spectrometry Inoculum Sample Peptide Spectra Missed cleavages Ions score* P -value Observed peptide mass Hypothetical peptide mass Charge state Record annotation 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 NN local lesion 1 RVD TMV and ToMV can be distinguished by the symptoms they produce on N. sylvestris that has the N\u2019 gene. the elicitor of N\u2019 was mapped indirectly to the ToMV CP gene by Saito et al.[31], who replaced the ToMV CP with an homologous TMV CP gene restriction fragment in an infectious ToMV clone. leaf extract from 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 virus-infected Xanthi SX was inoculated to N. sylvestris. by comparison, 1-34CE-30 virus produced systemic symptoms. by comparison, 1-34CE-30 virus produced systemic symptoms, but no local lesions on N. sylvestris. toMV-like symptoms of 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 virus may have been attributed to the hybrid ORF6 arising from replacing the coding region of the TMV CP gene with the coding region of the toMV CP gene. the final 16 of 34 amino acids of the hybrid ORF6 are derived from ToMV as well. hybrid ORF6 influences symptoms in N. benthamiana. it is partly encoded by the toMV CP gene to which N\u2019 gene elicitation is mapped. elicitation is attributed to the part that encodes the toMV CP gene. cleotides were designed from the BSMV CP gene text and used to replace the TMV CP gene to create 1-34CE-BSMV CP-30 DNA. the chimera virus did not produce any symptoms on inoculated Xanthi SX leaves, but it did produce localized necrosis on the inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana 3 weeks after infection. synthetic chimera viruses can produce unexpected and unusual symptoms. chimera does not explain spread of BSMV in barley in a mixed infection with BSMV. 7-Methyl guanosine capped-RNA was transcribed in vitro from gel purified PCR product of 1-30 and was inoculated to Nicotiana tabacum cv. the same amounts of RNA from DNA made by PCR amplification of the control plasmid pFL-TMV-NA, a known infectious TMV cDNA clone expressed by a T7 promoter, did produce local lesions on NN tobacco pFL-TMV-NA contains substitutions that add restriction endonuclease sites NdeI before the MP start codon and AflII before the MP stop codon. pFL-TMV-NA contains substitutions that add restriction endonuclease sites NdeI before the MP start codon and AflII before the MP stop codon. identical matches were made to the MR amino acids in the first seven reported TMV replicase records. the CE amino acids appeared in the first seven reported TMV replicase records. the next match in the BLASTP report to deviate from CE was that for Tomato mosaic virus, a closely related tobamovirus. encapsidation and infectivity of synthetic 1-34CE-30 and 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30. 1-34CE-30 RNA encapsidated in vitro with FL-TMV-NA CP. local lesions from 1-34CE-30 are to the left of the midrib. chimera synthetic virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 produced local lesions on Xanthi NN within 5 days and mosaic symptoms on Xanthi SX within 7 days. chimera synthetic virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 produced local lesions on Xanthi NN within 5 days. cDNA of ToMV was engineered to express the CP gene of TMV. peptides identified from plants

N\u2019 encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain, nucleotide binding site, and a leucine-rich repeat like many other plant disease resistance genes. 1-34CE-30 virus caused severe epinasty, chlorosis, curling, and lethal systemic leaf and stem necrosis. chimera virus 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 caused severe epinasty, chlorosis, curling, and lethal systemic leaf and stem necrosis. to determine the role of hybrid ORF6 in symptomology, the codons for the first two methionines of ORF6 were mutated. symptoms for the new virus, 1-34CE-ToMVnoorf6-30, were even milder on N. benthamiana compared to the other viruses with functional ORF6 genes. 1-34CE-ToMVnoorf6-30 virus was inoculated to N. benthamiana. local lesions appeared 3 days later. elicitation is attributed to the part of the gene that encodes the ToMV CP. the derivative chimera virus did not produce any symptoms on inoculated Xanthi SX leaves. but it did produce localized necrosis on the inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana 3 weeks after infection. the virus moved systemically 1 week later and produced unique mosaic symptoms without the systemic necrosis and stunting previously seen with 1-34CE-30 or 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 viruses. synthetic chimera viruses can produce unexpected and unusual symptoms. synthetic 1-34CE-BSMV CP-30. (A) Mosaic symptoms on N. benthamiana. (B) Virion from N. benthamiana. the chimera virus, 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30, moved systemically through tobacco. this verified that ToMV CP can complement the long-distance transport function of the TMV CP. however, the chimera produced toMV-like local lesions rather than TMV-like systemic mosaic in N. sylvestris. the inconspicuous ORF6 and its unnatural derivatives created by synthetic recombination can have pathological consequences. it should be feasible to use synthetic biology to restructure the ORFs in the TMV genome and separate the genetic responsibilities of these potential, undiscovered genes. synthetic RNA templates of infectious plant viruses were not maintained in bacterial plasmids. all plants and experimental materials that came into contact with synthetic virions and progeny were appropriately disposed. materials and methods Template design The basic nucleotide blueprint was the M13 (-20) primer sequence as an anchor, the T7 minimal promoter sequence immediately followed by the DNA conversion of the Goelet sequence. a terminal KpnI cleavage sequence (total length 6,443 nucleotides) was added for PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides annealed in 16 to 18 l TE buffer by heating to 95\u00b0C for 1 minute and cooling to 30\u00b0C at 0.1\u00b0C/s. assembly was amplified by PCR for 20 cycles using amplification oligonucleotides. RNA transcription 7-Methyl guanosine capped-RNA was produced from 250 to 1,000 ng DNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit. virions of FL-TMV-NA and 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 were purified from infected Xanthi SX. RNA (2 g) was encapsidated in a reaction with 100 g of purified FL-TMV-NA CP cDNAs of viral genomes were amplified using Ampoligos. mass spectrometry Protein was extracted from 1 cm2 leaf disks. extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 15 minutes. amplification oligonucleotides (Ampoligos) anchored the ends of each module. annealed long-oligonucleotides (0.5 l) were annealed in 16 to 18 l TE buffer. l synthesis reaction mix was amplified by PCR for 20 cycles using amplification oligonucleotides and Phusion Hot Start II DNA polymerase. DNA fragments were purified using UltraClean 15 (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) virions of FL-TMV-NA and 1-34CE-ToMV CP-30 were purified from infected Xanthi SX. RNA (2 g) was annealed to ampoligo 30 R and reverse transcribed using the Sanger method. cDNAs of viral genomes were amplified using Ampoligos. soluble protein (300 g) was reduced, derivatized, digested in trypsin. spectra matching viral peptides were confirmed not to have equivalent or better matches to plant protein records in NR. author declares that he has no competing interests. is dedicated to my TMV forefathers, CM Deom, RN Beachy and JA Dodds."}
