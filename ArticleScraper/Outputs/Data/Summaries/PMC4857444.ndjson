{"summary": "S. aureus accounts for more superficial and invasive infections than any other bacteria. a number of S. aureus surface proteins enable the microbe to adhere to and invade the host cells, as well as evade immune defence mechanisms. human serum ApoB binds and masks the quorum-signalling molecule of S. aureus, auto-inducing peptide (AIP), leading to transcriptional downregulation of agr expression in S. aureus. some Apos can interfere with the S. aureus switch from colonizing to invasive pathogen by antagonizing the S. aureus quorum-sensing system. ApoE is a major cholesterol carrier that has diverse functions in regulating lipid transport, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, neuronal signalling and modulating neuroinflammation. its interaction with cell-surface proteins of S. aureus has not been reported so far. serum was pooled, aliquoted and frozen at 80 \u00b0C. clumping factor A (rClfA) with a molecular mass of 80 kDa was generated. the stripped extracts were run on a 4\u201320 % SDS-PAGE gel. the gel was stained for all proteins using SYPRO Ruby. the proteins were identified using an indexed bacterial subset database. washed three times with PBST and stripped of retained proteins with 25 l of 2 % (w/v) SDS buffer. solutions were mixed with 4 reducing sample buffer, heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, loaded onto 4\u201320 % Tris/HCl mini SDS-PAGE gels. electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore) as described elsewhere. immulon 2HB plates were coated with 20 g purified human ApoE ml1 in carbonate buffer (50 l per well), followed by incubation at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. the wells were rinsed twice with 3 % (w/v) BSA in PBS solution and the surfaces were then blocked with the same solution at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10 844 g for 3 min, washed twice with sterile PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 % (w/v) BSA (PBS-BSA) to match 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. cells were incubated with ApoE (25 g ml1) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. membrane was loaded with escalating amounts of purified ApoE (0.32\u20133.2 g) after drying, the membrane with blocked with 3 % (w/v) BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at room temperature on a rotary shaker (100 r.p.m.) followed by rinsing three times with TBST solution. a single colony of each strain was inoculated in 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB; MP Biomedicals) for preservation of strains, a single colony of each strain was inoculated in 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB; MP Biomedicals) the serum was pooled, aliquoted and frozen at 80 \u00b0C. proteins, antibodies and chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific. protein bands were excised from SYPRO Ruby stained SDS-PAGE gels. they were processed for liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS-MS) the proteins were identified using an indexed bacterial subset database of the non-redundant proteins database. solutions of stripped proteins were mixed with 4 reducing sample buffer. electrophoresed 200 V for 45 min. proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore) as described elsewhere. Immulon 2HB plates were coated with 20 g purified human ApoE ml1 in carbonate buffer (50 l per well), followed by incubation at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. after coating, the wells were rinsed twice with 3 % (w/v) BSA in PBS solution and the surfaces were then blocked with the same solution at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. cell suspensions were incubated with ApoE (25 g ml1) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. centrifugation at 10 844 g for 3 min and washing twice with sterile PBS-BSA. cell-wall-bound ApoE was assessed as described under SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. the membrane was incubated with goat anti-ApoE antibody for 1 h on a rotary shaker (100 r.p.m.) for 45 min. mouse anti-goat IgG antibody HRP conjugate was incubated with the membrane. chemiluminescence was captured at 20 s exposure time. results were analysed with the Mann\u2013Whitney non-parametric test. the linearity model of protein interaction and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of rClfA binding to ApoE were determined. serum was pooled, aliquoted and frozen at 80 \u00b0C. protein bands were excised from SYPRO Ruby stained SDS-PAGE gels. the acquired data were processed using an indexed bacterial subset database of the non-redundant proteins database from ExPASy/Swiss-Prot. the proteins were identified using an indexed bacterial subset database of the non-redundant proteins database. the proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore) as described elsewhere (Walsh et al., 2004) after electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted to the membrane. the membrane was then incubated on a rotary shaker (100 r.p.m.) at room temperature for 1 h with goat anti-ApoE antibody. the wells were rinsed twice with 3 % (w/v) BSA in PBS solution. the surfaces were then blocked with the same solution at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the bacterial suspensions were transferred to ApoE-coated wells. bacterial cells were suspended in 600 l digestion buffer containing 10 g lysostaphin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 g DNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 l protease inhibitor. cell suspensions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, with rotational mixing. anti-ApoE antibody HRP conjugate was incubated with the membrane at room temperature on a rotary shaker (100 r.p.m.) for 45 min followed by rinsing with TBST three times. chemiluminescence was captured at 20 s exposure time using a VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad) fA binding to ApoE was determined at the two-tailed significance level. results Plasma proteins bound to rClfA were analysed using spss, version 18.0 (SPSS) predominant protein No. of peptides 1 Clumping factor A 4 2 Complement C3 1 3 Complement C3 2 4 Albumin 10 5 Apolipoprotein E 44 Table 2. MS identification of the predominant apolipoprotein E peptides. serum ApoE binding to rClfA was assayed by Western blot analysis. wells coated with rClfA showed a marked binding of ApoE. serum ApoE binding to BSA (control) could not be detected. escalating amounts of rClfA (0.32\u20132.6 g) were dot blotted onto the membrane. the membrane was then incubated with goat anti-ApoE antibody. the binding of ApoE to rClfA demonstrated two phases of binding kinetics. chemiluminescence signals of ApoE in diluted human serum bound to escalating concentrations of rClfA (0.32\u20132.6 g) on PVDF membrane. rClfA (0\u20132.6 g) binding to ApoE in diluted human serum (20 %, v/v, human serum in TBS\u2013BSA) human ApoE incubated with human ApoE (25 g ml1), washed and cell-wall extracts were prepared. western-blot analysis of the cell-wall preparation showed the presence of human ApoE with the characteristic band at 34 kDa. however, binding of human ApoE to the cell wall of the ClfA-deficient mutant (ClfA) could not be detected. the wild-type S. aureus (ClfA+) and the ClfA-deficient strain (ClfA\u2013) in suspension were incubated with ApoE-coated Immulon 2HB plates. colonies were then striped and colony counting was performed by the agar plating technique. excluding the minor variants of the 44 peptides identified for ApoE, yielded nine significant peptides. the tandem MS data of these peptides showed continuous series of both b and y fragmentation ions. these peptides provide a coverage map of 38 %, demonstrating good coverage and a high degree of confidence in the identification. serum ApoE binding to surface-coupled rClfA could not be detected. we assayed serum ApoE binding to rClfA in a CEWA. immunodot-blot technique was employed by blotting increasing amounts of ApoE (0.32\u20133.2 g) on PVDF membrane, followed by probing of ApoE. escalating amounts of rClfA (0.32\u20132.6 g) was dot blotted onto the membrane, which was then incubated with human serum. the linearity model of the ApoE in human serum binding to rClfA (0\u20132.6 g) demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.024) positive correlation with a stoichiometric binding ratio (rClfA : ApoE) of 1.702 at the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.927. densities obtained from immunodot-blot assays of serum ApoE binding to rClfA (g) were performed using the ApoE calibration curve. Western-blot analysis of the cell-wall preparation showed the presence of human ApoE with the characteristic band at 34 kDa. wild-type ClfA-expressing (ClfA+) and the ClfA-deficient strain (ClfA\u2013) in suspension were incubated with ApoE-coated Immulon 2HB plates. after washing, bound cells were then striped and colony counting was performed by the agar plating technique. columns indicate the means of colony counting after bacterial cell stripping from the ApoE-coated plates. the current study identifies ApoE as a potentially new ligand for the surface-expressed virulence factor ClfA. ClfA has been clearly demonstrated to be a major virulence factor in many animal models. cytokines can upregulate or downregulate the production of ApoE in various tissue types. cytokines are believed to mediate its non-lipid associated functions through binding to cell-surface receptors. a novel peptide derivative of human ApoE could reproduce some of the biological properties of ApoE. we identified, using MS, ApoE as the major plasma protein to bind surface-coupled recombinant ClfA. we evaluated their binding to rClfA through CEWA and dot blot assays. an isogenic ClfA-deficient strain revealed statistically significant (P = 0.05) decreased binding to human ApoE compared to the wild-type ClfA-sufficient strain. ClfA-deficient strains are markedly less virulent, suggesting that ApoE binding to ClfA is unlikely to contribute to immunological control of S. aureus. future studies will focus on elucidating whether ClfA binding of ApoE enhances or inhibits S. aureus virulence. studies will focus on elucidating whether ClfA binding of ApoE enhances or inhibits S. aureus virulence and the mechanism by which this occurs. in vivo studies utilizing ApoE-knockout animal models and ClfA-deficient S. aureus strains are required to address the in-depth mechanism."}
