{"summary": "the globalization of markets that has taken place in recent decades was a great opportunity for companies to become known and to operate in a wider context. this phenomenon led to the possibility that many managers who served in a national territory could be transferred to foreign countries, characterized by different cultures and work processes. but working globally involves changes in occupational dynamics and in the levels of job complexity, and it also requires great skills of adaptation and adjustment. djustment may be defined as the comfort degree (or the stress absence) associated with the role of the expatriate. expatriates who fail to face the demands of a job may experience high levels of stress. the scenario of stressors seems complex, from the micro-environment to the mega-environment. a lack of leisure activities and difficulties in communication may be a concern. there are higher psychological and physical strains in developing countries. the presence of pristine nature in some working locations might interact negatively with a lower standard of safety and health. the human body may be weakened by states of fear, especially if chronic. the immune, the nervous and the cardiovascular systems are damaged. however, the gastrointestinal tract and the reproductive system are not spared. model development Expatriate workers often experience difficulties in their adjustment to new work and living situations. this situation may enhance the fear of violence and poor living and working conditions during the experience abroad. this fundamental concept is the basis of our conceptual model. more than one-third of international assignments are dissatisfied with the health assistance they receive. healthcare is one of the main issues for expatriates: more than one-third of international assignments are dissatisfied with the health assistance they receive. the fear of expatriation might negatively influence the perception of the safety environment and the anxiety caused by economic crisis. in our model we expect a mediation process of fear of expatriation among mental health and further fears in the workplace. in 2014, the worldwide attacks numbered 13,463 (35% more than in 2013), which led to more than 32,700 deaths and more than 34,700 injured people. in 2014, such attacks numbered 13,463 (35% more than in 2013), which led to more than 32,700 deaths and more than 34,700 injured people. mental health problems generate fear of expatriation. the second part of the model is focused on the development of further fears in the workplace. emotions embody a particular theme, reflecting the way the individual sees his/her relationship with the environment. mental health problems, through the mediation of fear of expatriation, influence further fears in the workplace: dangerous working conditions and economic stress. the final respondents were 265 employees (response rate = 70%) working in multiple locations. fear of expatriation was measured by a new questionnaire developed by our research group and called Fear of expatriation scale (Supplementary Material) the measure is composed of two dimensions: fear of violence/terrorism (two items) employees are scared of being subjected to violence/terrorism (e.g., \"i am scared of being the object of physical violence \u2013 kidnapping, terrorism, etc.) standardized regression coefficients of items on each factor were all higher than 0.50. the correlation among latent constructs was higher than 0.89. this suggests that the two dimensions might be best combined on an overall scale of fear of expatriation. each dimension includes five items in a five-point Likert scale. the scale asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behavior related to general psychological health recently. each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (0-1-2-3). Expatriates spend 28 days outside the workplace (often in platforms or yards located worldwide) the final respondents were 265 employees (response rate = 70%) working in multiple locations (Italy, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Australia, etc.) the survey was administered through the corporate Intranet. the scores were collected, for each dimension, through a five-point Likert scale (from 1: \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5: \u201cstrongly agree\u201d). as this instrument was developed for this research, we evaluated the construct validity and reliability of the fear of expatriation scale by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) economic stress was measured with the scale about subjective economic stress included in the recent Stress Questionnaire (SQ), developed and validated in Italy (Giorgi et al., 2013; Mucci et al., 2015). each dimension includes five items in a five-point Likert scale (from 1: \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5: \u201cstrongly agree\u201d). fear of expatriation was measured by a new questionnaire. the scale asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behavior related to general psychological health recently. each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (0-1-2-3) a higher score indicates a greater degree of psychological distress. we assessed the construct validity (convergent validity and discriminant validity) of the scale by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis. results showed that the hypothesized factorial model yielded a good fit to the data (2[4] = 9.35, ns; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.02) scale includes five items in a five-point Likert scale. each dimension includes five items in a five-point Likert scale. the scale measures the extent to which the organization\u2019s working conditions are dangerous for employees\u2019 H&S. the scale asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behavior related to general psychological health recently. each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (0-1-2-3) a higher score indicates a greater degree of psychological distress. e fit indexes measure the proportionate amount of improvement in fit when a target model is compared with a more restricted, nested baseline model. we considered the comparative fit index (CFI), for which values of 0.90 or greater are recommended (Schreiber et al., 2006).

Specific inspection of direct relationships further revealed that mental health problems were positively associated with fear of expatriation, thus supporting Hypothesis 1. compared the hypothesized model with a non-mediation model (Model 3), which only included direct paths from mental health problems to fear of expatriation to economic stress and dangerous working conditions. results revealed that the non-mediation model was slightly worse fit to the data than the hypothesized fully-mediated model (2[1] = 3.16, ns) the indirect relationship between economic stress and perceived dangerous working conditions with fear of expatriation via fear of expatriation (Model 5); the indirect relationship between mental health problems and fear of expatriation via economic stress and perceived dangerous working conditions (Model 7); the relationship between fear of expatriation and mental health problems via economic stress and perceived dangerous working conditions (Model 8). fears are increasing in the workplace, marked by emotional discomfort, apprehension, or concerns about the internal and external environment. fear of expatriation is particularly associated with mental health problems. a lot of unhealthy issues such as stress, anxiety, loneliness and homesickness, generating a sort of potential and prolonged cultural shock. expatriates are a group of people with a high cumulative risk of exposure to illness and injury due to changes in travel patterns and activities. there are diseases that are not preventable with vaccines. these diseases seem to spread faster nowadays \u2013 such as recent Ebola or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. a further stress factor for expatriate workers is the managers\u2019 fear of terrorist attacks or other fatal events involving the governments of countries where there are companies\u2019 headquarters. fear of expatriation may adversely disturb human thinking and decision-making processes, leaving the individual more susceptible to generating further fears. iving a priori all foreign working conditions as more dangerous. the impact of working and living conditions may be higher if expatriates are scared by the impeded living conditions or by the threat of violence. this might have several negative implications as often expatriates have the tendency to \u201cget the job done\u201d as smoothly as possible. expatriates should be psychologically supported, e.g., with mentoring and coaching, analyzing competencies, health perceptions, and mood over time. the expatriates worked worldwide, but the sample was limited to a single company, limiting the generalizability of the results. the prevention and protection of the H&S of expatriate workers is not only an instrument of risk assessment but also a significant tool to improve the company\u2019s business. some studies have estimated that the cost associated with the failure of expatriation would be about one million USD (insch and Daniels, 2002; Wentland, 2003)."}
