{"summary": "the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is a major asexual blood stage antigen that is currently considered a strong vaccine candidate. the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a component of sporozoites that contains a B-cell epitope. malaria is a major health problem in many temperate and tropical countries. it reemerged in the early 1990s after two decade-long absence. it is unlikely that malaria has been completely eradicated from Korea. PvMSP-1 is a major merozoite surface protein in several Plasmodium species. it consists of 18 to 20 short repeated sequences flanked by pre-repeat and post-repeat areas. recombinant protein was reported to be a viable vaccine candidate. the antigenicity of a chimeric recombinant protein expressed in transgenic Brassica napus was investigated and evaluated as an edible vaccine candidate against vivax malaria. the chimeric recombinant protein was designed as a biphasic antigen to target both the blood and the early liver cell stages of vivax infection. the linker region contained five or six pro-Gly repeats. the original (ICB10ori, GenBank access no. AF435594) and the modified (MLCICB10) nucleotide sequences of P. vivax MSP-1. oligonucleotides were linked by T4 ligase in the order of 5'-PvMSP-1-linker-PvCSP-3' (MLC) this gene was then cloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli INVF' according to the manufacturer's instructions. explants excised from in vitro grown seedlings were cut into 0.5 to 1 cm pieces. cotyledons were immersed in the infection media (37 ml liquid infection medium consisting of 0.4% MSB5 salts, 2% sucrose, 1 g/ml of 2,4-D, 2 ml dimethyl sulfoxide) and a 10 ml pellet of Agrobacterium culture. regenerated shoots that had elongated to 2 to 3 cm in length were transferred to rooting medium. Approximately 6 weeks later, green shoots of approximately 5 to 6 cm in length were isolated and placed in Magenta boxes (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supernatants were collected and combined with 600 l chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol. the pellets were then dissolved in 20 l TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) plasmid DNA of a. tumefaciens GV3101 (pHSS2-MLC) and the PCR products of the transgenic plant genomic DNA samples were analyzed by Bionics Inc. (Seoul, Korea) plant protein extracts were prepared for enzyme-linked immnunosorbent assay and western blot analysis. group A mice were fed 1 g of ground leaves from non-transgenic B. napus. group C mice were fed 200 g of ground leaves from MLC-transgenic B. napus. ozoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the cut-off value was taken as the mean 2 standard deviations of the negative samples. IL-2, IL-12, IFN-, and TNF levels among the three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. a P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the ICB10 of PvMSP-1 and PvCSP VK210 subtype were linked via Pro-Gly repeat motifs. the linker region contained five or six Pro-Gly repeats surrounding an internal sequence of 10 amino acids, TLQTRIDEFG. chimeric oligonucleotides were synthesized with XbaI sites at the 5' end of PvMSP-1 and BamHI sites at the 3' end of PvCSP. this gene was then cloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli INVF' according to manufacturer's instructions. cotyledon explants excised from in vitro grown seedlings were cut into 0.5 to1 cm pieces. explants excised from in vitro grown seedlings were cut into 0.5 to1 cm pieces. regenerated shoots that had elongated to 2 to 3 cm in length were transferred to rooting medium. the same selection medium was used for shoot regeneration medium. regenerated shoots that had elongated to 2 to 3 cm in length were transferred to rooting medium. supernatants were collected and combined with 600 l chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. pellets were then dissolved in 20 l TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) DNA samples were verified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. extracted plant genomic DNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nptII gene (NPTII-F, 5'-GAACAAGATGGATTGCACGC-3' and NPTII-R, 5'-GAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGGC-3') plasmid DNA of A. tumefaciens GV3101 (pHSS2-MLC) and the PCR products of the transgenic plant genomic DNA samples were analyzed by Bionics Inc. (Seoul, Korea) mice were fed 1 g of ground leaves from non-transgenic B. napus. group B mice were fed 200 g of ground leaves from MLC-transgenic B. napus. mice were fasted overnight before oral administration. IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:1,000 (v/v, Sigma) for color development, 100 L of 2.2'-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiozoline-6-sulfonic acid) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 405 nm. isotype (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA, and IgM) were measured by Luminex 100TM IS. IL-2, IL-12 (p40), IFN-, and TNF levels among the three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. a P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. chimeric recombinant gene was inserted into the pHSS2 vector at XbaI and BamHI sites for expression in B. napus. the resulting expression vector was referred to as pHSS2-MLC. it was transformed into B. napus using an Agrobacterium-mediated DNA delivery system. non-transformed plants failed to amplify target MLC gene. PCR analysis using an nptII-specific primer set showed products of approximately 800 bp. DNA sequencing analysis of genomic DNA from transgenic B. napus plants demonstrated identical sequences to the MLC chimeric recombinant gene. antigen-specific antibodies were not detected in PBS fed mice or in mice fed 200 g of chimeric recombinant protein. two of the five mice fed 1 g of chimeric recombinant protein showed a positive reaction by Western blot. the mean amount of IFN- expression was 18.50 5.53 pg/ml in Group 1, 16.61 0.98 pg/ml in Group 2, 41.80 10.88 pg/ml in Group 3. there was a significant difference between Groups 1 and 3, and between Groups 1 and 2 (P 0.05) concentrations of IL-2, IL-12(p40), IFN-, and TNF- were measured. group 1, BALB/c mice fed PBS only; group 2, BALB/c mice fed non-transformed plant. values represent mean SD (n = 3). transformation of the MLC chimeric recombinant gene into B. napus. resulting expression vector was referred to as pHSS2-MLC. it was transformed into B. napus using an Agrobacterium-mediated DNA delivery system.

DNA sequencing analysis of genomic DNA from transgenic B. napus plants demonstrated identical sequences to the MLC chimeric recombinant gene. antigen-specific antibodies were not detected in PBS fed mice or in mice fed 200 g of chimeric recombinant protein. two of the five mice fed 1 g of chimeric recombinant protein showed a positive reaction by Western blot. the mean amount of IFN- expression was 18.50 5.53 pg/ml in Group 1, 16.61 0.98 pg/ml in Group 2, 41.80 10.88 pg/ml in Group 3. the mean amount of TNF- expression was 35.56 11.94 pg/ml in Group 1, 85.98 7.90 pg/ml in Group 2, and 188.90 22.74 pg/ml in Group 3. concentrations of IL-2, IL-12(p40), IFN-, and TNF- were measured. group 1, BALB/c mice fed PBS only; group 2, BALB/c mice fed non-transformed plant; group 3, BALB/c mice fed MLC chimeric recombinant protein. the expression and purification of chimeric recombinant proteins in plants has several advantages compared to other commercial expression systems. first, plant-based vaccines do not contain endotoxin, which is produced during bacterial culture and purification steps. if edible plants are used, plant-based vaccines can be eaten raw without modification in factories. with 1 g MLC chimeric recombinant protein produced antigen-specific antibodies, MLC chimeric recombinant protein-specific IgG1 antibodies were detected in two (40%) of the five mice. these observations indicate that the MLC chimeric recombinant protein has the possibility to trigger Th-2 immune responses. and HK performed PCR, Western blot, ELISA, cytokine, and immunoglobulin assays. HGR, HSL, and NJC helped design the study."}
