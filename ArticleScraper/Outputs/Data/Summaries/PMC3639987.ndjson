{"summary": "nephropathy is one of the major microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes. it is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease indicating a failure of current available preventive therapeutic strategies. renal renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. administration of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) increases albuminuria, mesangial pathologies and fibronectin deposition in diabetic mice. ACE2 is elevated in patients with diabetic nephropathy, renal disease, or renal transplant. a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17 is involved in the ectodomain shedding of several membrane bound proteins [19]\u2013[21]. chronic treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone markedly reduced urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic patients [27], [28], [28] TZDs modulate the RAS, in particular ACE [29], Ang II receptors [30], Ang I and Ang II levels [31]. but the effect of TZD\u2019s on ACE2 has not been investigated before. mice were euthanized by decapitation and trunk blood was collected in ice-chilled heparinized tubes. blood was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. plasma was separated, aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. Urine Collection Mice were placed individually in metabolic cages for 24-hour urine collection with free access to food and water. a total of 10 l of protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, IN, USA) was added to the collection tubes during the 24-hour collection period. urine samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. goat anti-nephrin (1200, R&D Systems) primary antibody followed by incubation with donkey anti-goat or anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1100, Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA) images were captured using a FV1000 Confocal Microscope (Olympus, PA, USA) 10 l plasma was incubated with 100 l of HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing the synthetic substrate [3H]-hippuryl glycine glycine ([3H]-Hip-Gly-Gly) at 37\u00b0C. after 60 min incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 l of 1 N hydrochloric acid. mass spectra were obtained using an autoflex III smartbeam MALDI time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF instrument. 3000 laser shots were acquired randomly for each spot in the range of m/z 500\u20133000 at a laser frequency of 100 Hz. plasma levels of insulin and glucagon were measured using a mouse adiponectin ELISA kit (Millipore, Austin, TX) mice housed individually with free access to food and water on a 12 hour light/dark cycle. mice were monitored weekly for blood glucose, body weight, food intake, water intake, and urine output over a period of eight weeks. glucose concentration was determined colorimetrically using a glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent kit (Sigma, MO, USA) samples were incubated with 100 l of assay reagent at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the reaction was stopped by adding 12 N H2SO4 and measured at 540 nm. perfused kidneys were anaesthetized and perfused transcardially with ice cold PBS and 10% formalin. perfused kidneys were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 m thickness and mounted on glass slides. images were captured using a FV1000 Confocal Microscope. the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse ACE2 (11000), rabbit anti-ADAM17 (1500) or goat anti-TIMP3 (1200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat (12000 R&D Systems, USA) ACE activity was measured using an assay kit purchased from ALPCO Diagnostics Ltd. a total of 3000 laser shots were acquired randomly for each spot in the range of m/z 500\u20133000 at a laser frequency of 100 Hz. plasma triglycerides were measured with a mouse adiponectin ELISA kit. plasma levels were calculated using standards provided with the Luminex kit. unpaired student\u2019s t-test was used to evaluate the differences between two groups. for more than two groups, one-way ANOVA was used. repeated measures two-way ANOVA using a Bonferroni\u2019s posthoc test showed that treatment with rosiglitazone caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels of db/db mice [F (3, 54) = 176.04], p0.0001. data are represented as mean SEM of group size (n = 6\u20138). mice consistently increased with age compared to control mice and control mice treated with rosiglitazone. plasma insulin, glucagon, triglyceride and glucose levels were significantly increased in db/db mice compared to control mice treated with rosiglitazone.

Western blot analysis detected a strong immunoreactive band for ACE2 at 70 kDa in the urine of db/db mice. excreted ACE2 levels were significantly higher in db/db mice relative to control mice or treated db/db mice. however, there was no significant difference in the renal ACE2 protein expression of rosiglitazone treated and untreated db/db mice. 0.05 Vs untreated db/db mice. each bar represents mean SEM of group size (n = 11\u201318) immunooreactive band for ACE2 was observed at 90 kDa in mouse kidney lysate (lane 1). one-way ANOVA showed urinary ACE2 protein excretion significantly increased in db/db mice compared to their age-matched lean control mice. significantly decreased in untreated and treated db/db mice compared to 30 wks old lean control mice. each bar represents mean SEM of group size (n = 6). chronic treatment with rosiglitazone significantly reduced urinary and renal ACE2 activity in treated db/db mice compared to untreated db/db mice. iglitazone mice compared to untreated db/db mice. no plasma ACE2 activity in control, db/db and db/db+rosiglitazone mice. formation of urinary Ang- (1\u20137) was attributed to ACE2 since it was reduced by 82% in the presence of specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760. chemical nature of the generated peptide was verified by MS/MS showing that the MS/MS spectrum for Ang-(1\u20137) generated enzymatically in urine was identical to the MS/MS spectrum of synthetic Ang (1\u20137) spiked into urine reaction mixtures. linear regression analysis showed significant positive correlation between urinary ACE2 activity and albumin excretion, plasma glucagon, plasma triglycerides and blood glucose levels. correlation between plasma glucagon and urinary albumin excretion in control, db/db and db/db+rosiglitazone mice 8 weeks after commencement of rosiglitazone treatment. overactivation of the RAS in diabetes leads to hypertension, fluid retention, and inflammation, causing renal and vascular end-stage disease in the long term [35] there is evidence that deletion of ACE2 leads to the development of Ang II dependent renal damage, suggesting ACE2 as renoprotective target in diabetes. hyperglycemia leads to nephropathy by various mechanisms, such as increased endothelial cell permeability to albumin, hypertrophy and thickening of the basement membrane. hyperglycemia leads to nephropathy by various mechanisms, such as increased endothelial cell permeability to albumin. treatment with rosiglitazone attenuated urinary ACE2 protein excretion and activity. rosiglitazone markedly attenuated renal ADAM17 in db/db mice. rosiglitazone treatment may impart renoprotection via attenuated shedding of ACE2. ACE2 activity has previously been observed in sheep serum and plasma of db/db mice. however, plasma ACE2 activity was not detectable in normal and healthy subjects. db/db mice showed an elevation in serum ACE2 activity. urinary ACE2 activity is elevated in db/db mice compared to control mice. plasma abnormalities (glucose, glucagon and triglycerides) showed a significant positive correlation with urinary ACE2. findings suggest that rosiglitazone imparts renoprotection at least partially by decreasing renal ACE2 shedding in db/db mice."}
