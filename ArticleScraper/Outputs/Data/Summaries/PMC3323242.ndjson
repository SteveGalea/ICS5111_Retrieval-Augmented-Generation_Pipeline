{"summary": "many exposed healthcare workers, patients, and visitors became infected and subsequently transmitted infection to others in their healthcare facilities. nosocomial transmission was the primary accelerator of SARS infections, accounting for 72% of cases in Toronto (3). the first phase consisted of sporadic SARS cases in travelers without nosocomial transmission (7). in the second phase, transmission at one municipal hospital ignited a number of subsequent nosocomial outbreaks. a number of factors may make nosocomial transmission a common mode of infection. exposures to an apparent \u201csuper-spreader\u201d with SARS contributed to an explosion of infections at a municipal hospital in Taipei. at least 137 probable cases, including 45 in healthcare workers. a small number of persons also generated a large number of cases during the first phase of the Toronto outbreak. 128 cases were associated with this hospital outbreak, including 47 (37%) hospital staff and 36 (28%) patients and visitors (5). after the first phase of SARS in Toronto, healthcare workers continued to use extensive personal protective equipment. after a period without apparent SARS transmission, public health officials relaxed the requirement for extensive PPE. a number of administrative, engineering, and other controls were eventually implemented to minimize transmission of SARS in emergency departments in both Toronto and Taiwan. a questionnaire was administered to entrants to identify SARS symptoms and exposures. in both Toronto and Taiwan, no transmission was reported in these facilities. a large number of healthcare workers were required to wear gowns, gloves, N95 or higher respirators, and eye protection, often for hours. in the past, this level of protection had been recommended infrequently for those treating patients with active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, suspected smallpox, or viral hemorrhagic fever (15). a small number of imported SARS cases were adequately contained in these isolation rooms. government officials provided resources to build new airborn-infection isolation rooms at hospitals. government officials provided resources to build new airborn-infection isolation rooms. in both Toronto and Taiwan, hospital officials restricted access to affected hospitals by limiting the number of entryways. access stations were staffed with personnel to screen for fever, symptoms, or potential SARS exposures. if medically necessary, transfers were made after consultation with hospital and public health authorities. a questionnaire was administered to entrants to identify SARS symptoms and exposures. screening was accompanied by a temperature check, mandatory hand hygiene by the patient, and often by providing a surgical mask before admission to the hospital. officials either constructed or retrofitted existing facilities to create SARS evaluation centers (i.e., \u201cFever Clinics\u201d) (13) in the past, this level of protection had been recommended infrequently for patients with active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. in the past, this level of protection had been recommended infrequently for those treating patients with such infections as active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. in the past, this level of protection had been recommended infrequently for those treating patients with such infections as active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. infection control in Toronto and Taiwan became an essential public health activity. public health authorities took an active role in assessing the adequacy of control measures in hospitals. after widespread infection-control practices, the number of new SARS cases declined. officials in Toronto and Taiwan considered designating a single facility to serve as a \u201cSARS hospital\u201d for their jurisdictions. this policy eliminated the need for a designated SARS hospital while maintaining a higher vigilance for SARS transmission at multiple facilities. a hospital to new admissions was made only in consultation with public health authorities. the world was declared free of ongoing SARS transmission 16. if this happens, nosocomial transmission and cases among healthcare workers may also occur."}
