{"summary": "a company in San Diego, CA, USA has produced a drug in tobacco leaves called ZMapp. it has been used to combat the 2014 outbreak in africa. as of October 2014, seven infected patients received an early treatment with ZMapp and fully recovered. another patient, receiving a late treatment with ZMapp in November 2014, succumbed to the disease and died. clinical trials of recombinant glucocerebrosidase (prGCD) in u.s. clinical trials. clinical trials of recombinant glucocerebrosidase (prGCD) in u.s. plant-derived antigen was physically and antigenically similar to the HBsAg obtained from human serum and recombinant yeast. the yeast-derived HBsAg is clinically used for HBV vaccination. by 2011, more than twenty PMF pharmaceuticals were placed in preclinical or clinical trials. recombinant taliglucerase alfa is used in an enzyme replacement therapy to treat adult patients with Gaucher disease. the drug is produced in carrot cells using a large bioreactor under very stringent conditions. the production and application of ELELYSOTM is not representative of other PMF-derived pharmaceuticals. disease, Moss-AGAL for Fabry Disease Moss Physcomitrella patens based Broytechnolgy Speed Scale and Customized [22] Kentucky BioProcessing, Owensboro, KY, USA Nicotiana benthamiana. a greater number of useful genes are being identified and characterized. the edible vaccine concept was first proposed by Charles Arntzen and coworkers after HBsAg (Hepatitis B Virus antigen) was produced in tobacco plants. uncooked potatoes from transgenic potato plants produced HBsAg were later tested orally in humans. the cost of plant maintenance for PMF is low, relative to E. coli, yeast, or mammalian cell expression systems. plant expression systems have several major advantages over prokaryotic and other eukaryotic cell systems. plant-expressed human VEGF is used as treatment for thinning hair. the amount of pharmaceutical produced may vary in each plant species, or even in different plant parts (i.e., leaves, fruit, and seeds) levels of expression in subsequent generations may also vary. microbial and animal cell expression systems have been used for over 30 years. ProdiGene, Inc. launched the large-scale production of transgenic maize that produces trypsin. but the USDA discovered that plant remnants from a previous ProdiGene trial had contaminated a nearby conventional field. the punitive action forced ProdiGene into bankruptcy. medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza combined the medicinal function of both FGF-1 and bioactive compounds within the medicinal plant. topical application of a plant extract would significantly reduce the cost of purification and downstream processing. a primary objective of PMF is to reduce the cost of producing novel therapeutic proteins. the time needed to utilize a standard PMF approach is unsuitable for addressing sudden viral epidemics. pBY030.2R is used to transiently express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves. bean yellow dwarf virus based single-vector DNA replicon system. based single-vector DNA replicon system transiently expressed antibodies MB-003 and ZMab in tobacco leaves. MB-003 and ZMab were later combined and designated as ZMapp. the use of these antibodies as a pharmaceutical drug was able to cure 100% of Ebola infected rhesus macaques primates. more than 20 recombinant proteins have been produced from plant cell culture systems. the tobacco strains, BY-2 and NT-1, are the most popular plant cell-culture based strains used as bioreactors in PMF. a yield of 20 mg/L of the human monoclonal antibody M12 was produced in optimum conditions. the ability of moss cells to photosynthesize in culture significantly reduces the cost of culture nutrients. moss cells can also produce a humanized form of a glycosylated protein, lewis Y-specific mAb MB314 [72], which reduces concerns about plant-specific glycosylation. algae can produce large amount of biomass within a very short period due to their short life cycle. downstream purification of recombinant proteins in algae is similar to yeast and bacterial systems. algae may not be able to produce human forms of glycosylated proteins due to lack of proper enzymatic machinery. plant-based systems for PMF have been developed in various plant species, including arabidopsis [90,92], tobacco [91], rice [93], and corn [94]. recombinant proteins targeted to seeds have been reported to accumulate to very high levels. the ER compartment in plant cells contains few proteases and therefore represents a relatively protective environment. recombinant protein targeted to seeds also allows long-term storage at room temperature without a detectable loss in activity. the advantages of producing recombinant proteins in seeds make this platform a cost-effective platform for PMF-based products. bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) based single-vector DNA replicon system, pBY030.2R, is used to transiently express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves. several viral vectors have been developed for small- or medium-scale PMF production. the first FDA approved PMF-based pharmaceutical, taliglucerase alfa, used to treat Guacher\u2019s disease, was produced in carrot cell suspension cultures. the first FDA approved PMF-based pharmaceutical, taliglucerase alfa, used to treat Guacher\u2019s disease, was produced in carrot cell suspension cultures. more than 20 recombinant proteins have been produced from plant cell culture systems. the tobacco strains, BY-2 and NT-1, are the most popular plant cell-culture based strains used as bioreactors in PMF. the recombinant protein can be expressed to be secreted into the culture medium. more than 20 recombinant proteins have been produced from plant cell culture systems. the tobacco strains, BY-2 and NT-1, are the most popular plant cell-culture based strains used as bioreactors in PMF. the recombinant protein can be expressed to be secreted into the culture medium to simplify the downstream purification process. the ability of moss cells to photosynthesize in culture significantly reduces the cost of culture nutrients. moss cells can also produce a humanized form of a glycosylated protein, lewis Y-specific mAb MB314 [72], which reduces concerns about plant-specific glycosylation. some recombinant therapeutic proteins, such as epidermal growth factor [74], -galactosidase [74], -amy microalgae have a very simple structure, and can be unicellular, colonial, or filamentous. downstream purification of recombinant proteins in algae is similar to yeast and bacterial systems. however, recombinant proteins produced from algae do not undergo certain post translational modifications. prelimary studies demonstrated that transient expression of various blood clot-dissolving serine proteinases in leaves resulted in leaf necrosis four days after infiltration. the purified proteins exhibited the ability to dissolve fibrin and blood clots. targeting the production of PMF-based products to seeds is becoming an attractive alternative. the ER compartment in plant cells has been shown to contain few proteases. recombinant protein targeted to seeds also allows long-term storage. recombinant protein targeted to seeds also allows long-term storage. mice and rats with horseradish peroxidase elicited the production of antibodies (Abs) specific for plant glycans. a human sera test also detected antibodies to plant glycans. the anti-plant glycan immune response is highly undesirable. recombinant human antibody fragment and an active enzyme were successfully produced with a controlled glycosylation pattern. RNAi lines of lemna [79], alfalfa [105], and tobacco [106] have been developed that down regulate -(1,2) XylT and -(1,3) FucT activity. RNAi technology was used to reduce the level of enzymes involved with plant core -(1,2) xylose and core -(1,3) fucose synthesis. recombinant mAbs produced in duckweed system contain a single major N-glycan that has a 20-fold better antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and a 10-fold higher cell receptor binding activity than mAbs produced in CHO cells. a transient expression approach is used to produce \"biobetter\" monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and anti-viral mAb. downstream processes include an automated system for the production of various buffers. the cost of producing, purifying, and formulating the PMF products has been significantly reduced."}
