{"summary": "peptides are present in human vascular and cardiac endothelial cells and plasma. interaction with the apelin receptor on cardiac myocytes causes increased cardiac contractility and inotropic action. interaction with the apelin receptor on cardiac myocytes causes increased cardiac contractility and inotropic action. human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has 40% sequence similarity with the C-terminal dipeptidyl-peptidase, ACE. ACE2 is expressed for example in heart, kidney and lung. ACE2 is also a viral receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Li et al., 2008) some beneficial actions of ACE2 are thought to be mediated by the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin(1\u20137). but the possibility of interaction of ACE2 with other peptides was not clear until a screen of over 120 biologically active peptides reported only two others to be hydrolyzed with high catalytic efficiency by ACE2. we have performed first-in-man studies with [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) to explore the physiological action of the peptide in healthy volunteers. our data expand our knowledge on the structure activity relationship of apelin peptides and demonstrate the significant biological activity of the ACE2 metabolite.

ACE2 (1:50, R&D Systems, MN, USA and 1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antisera were also used. the apelin-12 antiserum demonstrated selectivity to [Pyr1]Apelin-13 () relative to [Pyr1]Apelin-13(1\u201312) (). competition binding assays Assays were performed in human heart as previously described. cell-based functional assays Inhibition of cAMP accumulation, -arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization by apelin isoforms. in all assays the resulting chemiluminescent signal was measured as relative light units (RLU) data were analyzed using a 4-parameter logistic equation. n-Values are given as number of replicates/number of experiments. cAMP and -arrestin assays with the predominant cardiac isoform [Pyr1]apelin-13 used as reference ligand. the inotropic action of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) was determined in mouse paced RV (n = 6) and for comparison in two samples of human paced atrial appendage strips. data from vascular and cardiac experiments were analyzed.

[Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) is synthesized from [Pyr1]apelin-13 by ACE2. all apelin peptides were synthesized by severn biotech (Kidderminster, UK) [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) is an endogenous apelin peptide localized to the endothelium Endogenous [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) peptide was detectable in human cardiovascular tissues and localized to the endothelium. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) was detected in vascular (Figure 4A) and endocardial bright field microphotographs of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-LI in vascular and endocardial endothelium. vWF-LI in cardiomyopathy human heart exhibited comparable affinity to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-LI. yr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) binds to and activates human apelin receptor. peptide apelin-17 competed with highest affinity (pKi = 9.63 0.17, n = 3) all ligands fully inhibited cAMP production. all ligands retained nanomolar potency. inhibition was incomplete for apelin-13(R9P) and aplin-13(P9M) at 10 M. both peptides were full agonists with comparable efficacy values. both peptides were full agonists with comparable efficacy values. analysis showed bias factor of 0.24 for [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) and apelin-17. both of the rhACE2 combinations exhibited comparable potency to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) (p > 0.05) therefore the reaction product of [Pyr1]apelin-13 and rhACE2 more closely resembled [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) contracted saphenous vein with comparable sub-nanomolar potencies. pD2 = 9.63 0.35, EMAX = 24 6%, n = 9) and apelin-13(F13A) contracted saphenous vein with comparable sub-nanomolar potencies. in anesthetized rat, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) (n = 5) elicited a dose-dependent decrease in BP. other cardiac parameters, SV, CO, PV and VTI were not altered. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) is synthesized from [Pyr1]apelin-13 by ACE2. incubating [Pyr1]apelin-13 with rhACE2 resulted in a signal at the mass-to-charge ratio of 1533.8 and 1386.7 m/z. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) is an endogenous apelin peptide localized to the endothelium Endogenous [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) peptide was detectable in human cardiovascular tissues and localized to the endothelium. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) was detected in vascular (Figure 4A) and endocardial bright field microphotographs of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-LI in (A) vascular and (B) endocardial endothelium and (C) vWF-LI in cardiomyopathy human heart. peptide apelin-17 competed with highest affinity (pKi = 9.63 0.17, n = 3) of shorter fragments apelin-13(R10M) (1 M) competed for 100% of specific binding. apelin-13(R9P) and apelin-13(P9M) were less effective competing for 38% and 62% respectively. inhibition was incomplete for apelin-13(R9P) and aplin-13(P9M) at 10 M. [Pyr1]apelin-13 (pD2 = 8.43 0.08, n = 25/10), [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) and apelin-13(F13A) were 15-40-fold less potent than in the cAMP assay. both endogenous peptides were full agonists with comparable efficacy values (EMAX values were 97 2% and 99 3% respectively) analysis showed bias factor of 0.24 for [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) and apelin-17 was 4-fold G protein biased compared to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) both of the rhACE2 combinations exhibited comparable potency to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) (p > 0.05) therefore the reaction product of [Pyr1]apelin-13 and rhACE2 more closely resembled [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) than [Pyr1]apelin-13. 0.35, EMAX = 24 6%, n = 9) and apelin-13(F13A) contracted saphenous vein with comparable sub-nanomolar potencies and maximum responses. pD2 = 9.72 0.36, EMAX = 23 4%, n = 9) in endothelium-denuded human vein. the decrease in BP was significantly different (P 0.0001) from baseline at doses of 10\u2013300 nmol. other cardiac parameters, SV, CO, PV and VTI were not altered by [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) fusion of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in healthy volunteers resulted in a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow. for the first time we have detected endogenous [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in human cardiovascular tissues and demonstrated biological activity of this metabolite in vitro. a small proportion of [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved into [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in rat in vivo. we have previously demonstrated endothelial expression of apelin. ACE2 is also expressed in the endothelium (Donoghue et al., 2000; Hamming et al., 2004) the ACE2 product of [Pyr1]apelin-13 exhibits reduced or absent cardiovascular actions compared to the parent molecule. emerging evidence from structure activity studies suggested that the C-terminal phenylalanine was not a critical residue for apelin biological activity. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP with potency only 2-fold less than [Pyr1]apelin-13. this is in accordance with previous reports of alanine and D-phenylalanine substituted [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) receptor binding. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) contracted human saphenous vein with equal potency and efficacy compared with previous data for [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in anesthetized rat compared to previous data for [Pyr1]apelin-13 (Brame et al., 2015) the ACE2 metabolite caused a smaller but significant drop in blood pressure. in a first-in-man study, infusion of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) resulted in an increase in forearm blood flow. the 55-amino acid proapelin, derived from the 77-residue prepropeptide, contains a number of paired basic amino acids residues. we have investigated whether the truncated peptides apelin-13(R10M), apelin-13(R9P) and apelin-13(P9M retained significant binding and functional activity. we have also explored the pharmacology of several other important apelin isoforms to better understand the apelin structure activity relationships. early alanine scanning studies indicated that replacing the C-terminal phenylalanine with alanine did not abolish binding or functional activity. conflicting data have been reported for F13A, suggesting that it was an antagonist of the apelin receptor in terms of Gi-mediated signaling. peptides that stabilize different conformations of the apelin receptor may be fine-tuned at the cellular level. apelin knockout mice showed aging or stress-associated cardiac contractility defects. ACE2 expression is reduced in apelin knockout mice and apelin up-regulates ACE2 expression. our study contributes further evidence that ACE2 acting on [Pyr1]apelin-13 may result in the generation of the active metabolite, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312), and therefore a compensatory maintenance of apelin receptor signaling. a limitation of our study is that we have not measured levels of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) would be elevated and [Pyr1]apelin-13 decreased compared to controls a small proportion of [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved into [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in rat in vivo. a small proportion of [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved into [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) in rat in vivo. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)-LI was specifically localized to the endothelium, where the apelin receptor was also expressed. no staining for [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) was detected. the native human apelin receptor exhibits only a 3-fold reduction in binding affinity compared with the parent peptide. this is consistent with previous studies where the C-terminal phenylalanine of [Pyr1]apelin-13 or apelin-13 was replaced with alanine (F13A) [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) acts as a full agonist at the human apelin receptor. this ability to induce receptor internalization without the C-terminal phenylalanine was reported for apelin-13(F13A) however, K16P was shown to exhibit markedly reduced potency and efficacy in -arrestin recruitment and internalization of rat apelin receptor. in a first-in-man study, infusion of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) resulted in an increase in forearm blood flow that was the same magnitude as previously obtained with [Pyr1]apelin-13 (Brame et al., 2015) the ACE2 metabolite caused a smaller but significant drop in blood pressure. the 55-amino acid proapelin, derived from the 77-residue prepropeptide, contains a number of paired basic amino acids residues that are possible cleavage sites for endopeptidases to produce 13 to 36-residue isoforms. post-translational modification results in the predominant apelin isoform detected in human cardiovascular tissue and plasma. runcated peptides apelin-13(R10M), apelin-13(R9P) and apelin-13(P9M) retained significant binding and functional activity with the hypothesis that apelin-13(R10M) was likely to represent the minimum active fragment as it was the shortest fragment containing all the identified important amino acids. apelin-13(F13A) behaves as an apelin agonist with no evidence of receptor antagonism. we investigated apelin-17 in our assays and consistently found higher binding affinity and potency than [Pyr1]apelin-13 in the cAMP and -arrestin assays. this suggests that N-terminal extension of apelin-13 may result in peptides that stabilize different conformations of the apelin receptor. ACE2 expression is reduced in apelin knockout mice and apelin up-regulates ACE2 expression, indicating that apelin may reciprocally impact ACE2. the opposing effects of apelin/ACE2 and angiotensin II have been shown in health and diseases such as heart failure, atherosclerosis and obesity/diabetes. ACE2 cleaves [Pyr1]apelin-13 into [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) and has demonstrated biological activity of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) at the human apelin receptor in vitro and in the cardiovascular system of rat and human in vivo. authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
