{"summary": "gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced into YNP after a >70 year absence. in 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus was temporally variable. high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence. none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management. in wolves, we also screened for exposure to Neospora caninum. the protozoan parasite is transmitted between canids and ungulates. oocysts are shed in feces and then consumed by ungulates through contaminated forage and water. study area YNP encompasses 8,991-km2 of protected land in northwestern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Montana and Idaho in the western United States. YNP is mountainous (elevation range: 1,500 to 3,800 m), and its steep gradients in elevation, soil, and climate contribute to varied land cover. yNP is surrounded by the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), a 60,000-km2 area that includes national forests, wildlife refuges, and a mosaic us arctos and black bears (Ursus americanus), cougars, coyotes, red foxes, badgers (Taxidea taxus), river otters (Lontra canadensis), american martens (Martes americana), short (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), striped skunks (Mephitis me coyotes and foxes were captured from three regions (Lamar Valley, Blacktail Plateau, and Gardiner River Basin) they were captured using padded, offset, center-swivel, foot-hold traps. individuals were classified as juveniles (0.5\u20131.5 yrs), young adults (1.6\u20134.9 yrs) or old adults (5 yrs) coyotes (n = 110 samples from 109 individuals [44 females, 64 males, 1 unk.], during 1991\u20131992, 1996\u20131999, and 2003\u20132005) were screened for antibodies to CPV, CAV-1, CDV, and N. caninum (wolf samples only due to insufficient quantities of coyote and fox sera) wolf-pup and coyote-juvenile data separated from wolf adult (1 yr) and coyote adult (1 yr) data in the analysis of CPV, CDV, and CAV-1 serological data. a negative CHV test result most likely reflects an uninfected individual, although a latent infection cannot be ruled out. we evaluated age class as a risk factor for recent infection with the parasite. we evaluated age class as a risk factor for recent infection with the parasite. wolves, coyotes, young adult and old adult were also a risk factor. wolf-pup (0.5\u20130.9 yr) and adult (1 yr) and coyote juvenile (0.5\u20131.5 yrs) and adult (1.6\u20134.9 yrs) Age class * Age class was used as a factor in the analysis of canine herpesvirus and N. caninum exposure in wolves and coyotes. wolf-pup survival year (1995\u20132007) and location effects on wolf-pup survival were evaluated using a logistic, generalized, linear, mixed model with random pack effects and AICc model-selection procedures. wolves, coyotes, and foxes used in this study were handled in strict accordance with recommendations from the American Society of Mammalogists. YNP is mountainous (elevation range: 1,500 to 3,800 m), and its steep gradients in elevation, soil, and climate contribute to varied land cover. the 1,000-km2 area of the NR within YNP is characterized by lower elevations (1,500\u20132,200 m), serves as prime wintering habitat for the park\u2019s ungulates. the interior of the park (7,991 km2) is higher in elevation (>2,500 m), receives higher annual snowfall asels (Mustela frenata), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and wolverines (Gulo gulo) are present in the surrounding GYE. the national park service has captured and radio-collared an annual average of 26 wolves spanning all known packs in the park. foxes were captured from three regions spanning east to west on the NR inside YNP from September through October. individuals were classified as juveniles (0.5\u20131.5 yrs), young adults (1.6\u20134.9 yrs) or old adults (5 yrs) based on tooth wear. each wolf was identified as belonging to a particular pack. coyotes and foxes were captured on the NR of YNP. they were classified as pups (12 months) or adults. monitoring of radio-collared coyotes allowed classifying individuals as residents or transients (i.e., member of a territorial pack) however, we did not have detailed information on individual coyotes\u2019 pack membership or territory location. exposure data from resident and transient individuals captured in the same region were assumed to be non-independent. wolf-pup survival We identified wolf dens by tracking radio-collared adult females throughout April. pups counted weekly in May and June. survival data were not available for coyote-pups and fox-kits. coyote adult (1.6 yrs) data in the analysis of CPV, CDV, and CAV-1 serological data. a negative CHV test result most likely reflects an uninfected individual. a positive N. caninum test suggests an active or recent infection with the parasite. status (coyotes only) and age class (CHV and N. caninum analyses only) were evaluated to test the evidence for temporal variation in exposure, location effects to determine if NR wolves exhibited a higher risk of exposure compared to Interior wolves. age class was used as a factor in the analysis of canine herpesvirus and N. caninum exposure in wolves and coyotes. wolf-pup survival year (1995\u20132007) and location effects on wolf-pup survival were evaluated using a logistic, generalized, linear, mixed model with random pack effects. not all monitored dens were visible from the air or ground, so we did not always have pup counts to match the serological results. wolf-pup and coyote-juvenile data were analysed separately from wolf adult (1 yr) and coyote adult (1 yr) and coyote adult (1 yrs) data. wolf-pup and coyote-juvenile data were analysed separately from wolf adult (1 yr) and coyote adult (1 yrs) data. wolves and coyotes as a risk factor for recent infection in our analyses of these two pathogens. age class as a risk factor for recent infection with CHV or N. caninum. year effects were evaluated to test the evidence for temporal variation in exposure. wolf-pup (0.5\u20130.9 yr) and adult (1 yr) and coyote juvenile (0.5\u20131.5 yrs) and adult (1.6\u20134.9 yrs) Age class was used as a factor in the analysis of canine herpesvirus and N. caninum exposure. all candidate models within 2 AICc units from the best-supported model (lowest AICc value) were considered to have reasonable support. support for each model was evaluated based on its Akaike weight, wi, ranging from zero (no support) to one (full support, relative to the other models considered) coyote seroprevalence is divided into residents (R) and transients (T) the fraction of (positives/total samples) are noted parenthetically. canine adenovirus Type-1 (CAV) Wolf Pups

adult CAV-1 seroprevalence included a covariate for resident status. annual canine distemper virus seroprevalence among wolves and coyotes in Yellowstone National Park, 1991\u20132007. the probability of CDV exposure among wolf pups was highest in 1999, 2002, and 2005. both NR pups and adults had as much as a 36% and 14% positive difference in their probability of exposure compared to their interior counterparts. the four best-supported models for N. caninum exposure among wolves suggested that age class, year, and location were important covariates. old adults had the greatest probability of exposure to N. caninum (Pr[E] = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.83, 0.99; seroprevalence = 87%) data are divided by age class: juvenile (0.5\u20131.9 yrs), young adult (2\u20134.9 yrs) and old adult (5 yrs). there were too few fox samples to look for patterns of exposure, but we did find evidence for fox exposure to CPV, CAV-1, CDV, and CHV. the 95% CIs on the NR survival estimates from 2005 overlap with those of 1995 and 1996. the latter\u2019s confidence intervals are almost certainly too large. annual wolf-pup survival coincided with significant variation in annual pup survival on the NR. the best-supported models of coyote CPV seroprevalence also suggested either a constant probability of exposure of 0.94 for both adults (95% CI: 0.85, 0.98) and juveniles (95% CI: 0.79, 0.98) or a non-significant effect of resident status. among juvenile coyotes, residents had a smaller probability of exposure than transients. canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus type-1 (CAV-1) and canine herpesvirus (CHV) are divided into residents (R) and transients (T) the fraction of (positives/total samples) are noted parenthetically.

CDV seroprevalence was 100% in 1999 and 2005 among both age groups. adult resident coyotes had as much as an 18% positive difference in the probability of CDV exposure compared to adult transients. old adults had the greatest probability of exposure to N. caninum (Pr[E] = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.73) followed by young adults (Pr[E] = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.36), and juveniles (Pr[E] = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.13). there was no significant difference in year effects on the probability of exposure. the best-supported model for annual wolf-pup survival included only year and location covariates, but also model support for a year*location interaction. the probability of survival was significantly lower among NR pups in 2005. none of the other viral pathogens (CPV, CAV-1, and CHV) exhibited significant temporal variation capable of explaining temporal patterns of pup survival. annual wolf-pup survival was independent of annual pup exposure to N. caninum (NR: r 2 = 0.18, t = 1.39, df = 10, P = 0.20; Interior: r 2 = 0.09, t = 0.91, df = 10, P = 0.38) CPV, CAV-1, and CHV are enzootic, and that CDV is epizootic. wolves, N. caninum appears enzootic, although it does exhibit some temporal variation. resident status of coyotes was one variable that consistently emerged as a possible risk factor. studies have reported high seroprevalences for CPV among wild canids. wolves and coyotes that we tested in YNP were positive for CPV exposure by 0.5\u20130.75 yrs of age. this high seroprevalence suggests low levels of disease-induced host mortality [50], [51] and high rates of transmission. wolves\u2019 higher seroprevalence may be attributed to higher contact rates. wolves\u2019 higher seroprevalence may be attributed to higher contact rates. wolves\u2019 higher seroprevalence may be attributed to higher contact rates. we did not sample wild canids outside of YNP. there is no evidence that N. caninum has been or will be significantly impacting domestic or wild canids or canids in the GYE. if all infected pups in the Interior died due to disease, those available for sampling would all be negative. if all infected pups in the Interior died due to disease, those available for sampling would all be negative. in 2002, the two positive interior pups had antibody titers just over the positive titer cutoff value (Positive antibody titer: 16) in contrast to marked increases in the titers observed among NR pups in 1999 and 2005. wolf-pup data suggested low rates of seroconversion between the discrete outbreak years of 1999, 2002, and 2005. a thorough analysis of factors influencing wolf-pup survival would evaluate multiple hypotheses such as population density and food availability. the strong negative correlation between NR CDV seroprevalence and wolf-pup survival supports the hypothesis that CDV may have contributed to high NR pup mortality in 1999 and 2005. interior packs\u2019 dens were remote and only visible from the airplane. on average, we made our first pup observations and obtained our first high counts of pups over a month later than those made on the NR. we also failed to detect pup mortality due to bias in our sampling methods. single positive animal sampled in 1996 could have been exposed as a kit during the 1989/90 outbreak. however, there are no data on CDV exposure or survival patterns in YNP. domestic animals cannot be ruled out as a reservoir for CDV. the constant high canid exposure to CPV, CAV-1, and CHV in YNP suggests that these pathogens are established in the wolf and coyote populations. wolf exposure indicates a sylvatic cycle in the park, which may or may not be related to the parasite\u2019s dynamics among regional livestock. canine adenovirus type-1 Nearly all wolves also exhibited exposure to CAV-1, but there was no evidence for or against disease-induced mortality. wolves had much lower seroprevalences to CAV-1 than did wolf pups, but this may have been due to the slightly younger age at which coyotes were sampled. ylvatic cycle of this protozoan parasite exists in YNP. domestic livestock, except horses, are prohibited in YNP. wolves have not shed N. caninum oocysts. livestock is likely not the source of canid exposure to N. caninum in YNP. wild ungulates are suspected to be intermediate hosts and the source of exposure for YNP wolves. wolves have not shed N. caninum oocysts. coyotes experienced CDV outbreaks in 1999 and 2005. all wolves experienced CDV outbreaks in 1999, 2002, and 2005. NR wolves experienced a greater probability of CDV exposure than Interior wolves. if CDV entered from the south before pup birth or weaning, it could have swept through the interior adults. if there was in fact a 2002 outbreak, it seems to have been confined to the interior wolves. however, there may be reason to suspect false positives in this particular case. the low seroconversion between epizootics suggests re-exposure from some wild or domestic host outside YNP. loss of immunity, or imperfect protection against novel strains of CDV among canids, has been documented in raccoons (Procyon lotor) [70] we found no relationship between interior CDV seroprevalence and wolf-pup survival. despite negative correlation between CDV exposure and pup survival, the ultimate causes of death could have been due to synergistic effects of CDV and another pathogen. yNP coyotes experienced a CDV outbreak between 1989 and 1991. this fits with the 50% seroprevalence we detected in adult coyotes. cougars in YNP appeared to experience isolated outbreaks of CDV in 1991 and 1999. yNP and the GYE are not closed biological systems. there is currently no proof of dog health or immunization required for entry into the national parks. yNP is a small fraction of the overall GYE, and pathogen dynamics within YNP may be in part a product of larger-scale dynamics driven by inter-connected canid and carnivore populations. data are largely based on the study of domestic dogs.
