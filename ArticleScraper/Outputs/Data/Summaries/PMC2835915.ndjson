{"summary": "polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found largely in fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages. a glass of red wine or a cup of tea or coffee contains about 100 mg polyphenols. a glass of red wine or a cup of tea or coffee contains about 100 mg polyphenols. 8,000 polyphenolic compounds have been identified in various plant species. all plant phenolic compounds arise from a common intermediate, phenylalanine, or a close precursor, shikimic acid. association with other compounds, like carboxylic and organic acids, amines, lipids and linkage with other phenol is also common. stilbenes contain two phenyl moieties connected by a twocarbon methylene bridge. most extensively studied stilbene is resveratrol. hydroxycinnamic acids are more common than hydroxybenzoic acids. flavonoids are divided into six major sub-classes: flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, flavones, anthocyanins and isoflavones. flavanols lack a 3-hydroxyl group in the 3-position on the C ring. stilbenes Stilbenes contain two phenyl moieties connected by a two-carbon methylene bridge. lignans are diphenolic compounds that contain a 2,3-dibenzylbutane structure that is formed by the dimerization of two cinnamic acid residues. the richest dietary source is linseed, which contains secoisolariciresinol (up to 3.7 g/kg dry weight) many polyphenols, especially phenolic acids, are directly involved in the response of plants to different types of stress. they contribute to healing by lignifications of damaged areas possess antimicrobial properties, and their concentrations may increase after infection. studies have proved that polyphenolic content of the foods change on storage. polyphenols are conjugated in the intestinal cells and later in the liver by methylation, sulfation and/or glucuronidation. the most common polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those showing highest concentration of active metabolites in target tissues. the fate of glycosides in the stomach is not clear yet. proanthocyanidins differ from most of other plant polyphenols because of their polymeric nature and high molecular weight. hydroxycinnamic acids are rapidly absorbed by the small intestine and are conjugated as the flavonoids. sulfo-transferases catalyze the transfer of a sulfate moiety during process of sulphonation. glucuronidation occurs in the intestine and in the liver. the highest rate of conjugation is observed in the C3-position. excretion of polyphenols occurs through urine and bile. small conjugates, such as monosulfates, are preferentially excreted in urine. the health beneficial effects of the polyphenols depend upon both the intake and bioavailability. consumption of polyphenols limits the incidence of coronary heart diseases. polyphenols can improve endothelial dysfunction associated with different risk factors for atherosclerosis before the formation of plaque. consumption of black tea about 450 ml increases artery dilation 2 hours after intake and consumption of 240 mL red wine for 30 days countered the endothelial dysfunction induced by a high fat diet. a higher consumption of tea and therefore higher excretion of 4OMGA were associated with lower blood pressure (BP) association between polyphenol intake or consumption of polyphenol-rich foods and incident of cardiovascular diseases was also examined in several epidemiological studies. it was found that consumption of polyphenol rich diet have been associated to a lower risk of myocardial infarction in both case-control and cohort studies. cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in their activation to carcinogens. they may also facilitate their excretion by increasing the expression of phase II conjugating enzymes. polyphenols can form potentially toxic quinones in the body that are, themselves, substrates of these enzymes. resveratrol can modulate multiple pathways involved in cell growth, apoptosis and inflammation. it has been shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase, hydroperoxidase, protein kinase C, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Akt, focal adhesion kinase, NFB, matrix metalloprotease-9 and cell cycle regulators. in vitro and in vivo studies provide a rationale in support of the use inhibition of -glucosidase in the gut mucosa has been studied. polyphenols, such as (+)catechin, ()epicatechin, ()epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, isoflavones from soyabeans, tannic acid, glycyrrhizin from licorice root, chlorogenic acid and saponins also decrease S-Glut-1 mediated intestinal transport of glucose hibiscus sabdariffa extract contains polyphenolic acids, flavonoids, protocatechuic acid and anthocyanins. study showed that polyphenols present in the extracts attenuate diabetic nephropathy including pathology, serum lipid profile and oxidative markers in kidney. ocyanins have been shown to have potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory activities. they inhibit lipid peroxidation and the inflammatory mediators cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and -2.79 Fruit and vegetable extracts that have high levels of flavonoids also display high total antioxidant activity such as spinach, strawberries and blueberries. resveratrol can extend lifespan in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode worm C. elegans, and seasonal fish Nothobranchius furzeri. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the most common occurring neurodisorder affecting up to 18 million people worldwide. polyphenols from fruits and vegetables seem to be invaluable potential agents in neuroprotection by virtue of their ability to influence and modulate several cellular processes such as signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, redox balance and differentiation. nutritional studies have linked the consumption of green tea to the reduced risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease. polyphenols may protect against obstructive lung disease. increased consumption of the soy isoflavone, genistein, was associated with better lung function in asthmatic patients. polyphenols also protect skin damages induced from sunlight. 3\u2032 digallate, and theaflavin 3\u2032 gallate were found to inhibit chymotrypsin like protease (3CL Pro) this antiviral activity was due to inhibition of the chymotrypsin like protease which is involved in the proteolytic processing during viral multiplication."}
