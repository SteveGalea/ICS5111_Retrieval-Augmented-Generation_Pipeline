{"summary": "a frameshifting mRNA (FSmRNA) was designed following the 1PRF signals in the dnaX gene. the SD sequence is positioned 5 nt upstream from the AUG start codon. the stem loop was modified to form 12 bp and to have an in-frame stop codon in the loop. elongation by successive injections of 100 nM EF-Tu(GTP)Lys-(Cy5)tRNALys TC and 2 M EF-G(GTP) with washing steps in-between, forming another POST complex with fMet-Val-Lys-(Cy5)tRNALys in the vacant A site. most FRET efficiency (EFRET; the acceptor fluorescence intensity divided by the sum of acceptor and donor flu the transitions to the 0.8 EFRET state were followed by continuous fluctuations between the 0.2 and 0.8 EFRET states. these observations indicate that peptidyl transfer took place, forming a PRE complex containing a deacylated (Cy5)tRNALys in the P site and a peptidyl-tRNALys in the A site. tpt is the duration from TC(K) delivery to the first transition to the high, 0.8 EFRET state. tpt corresponds to the time for a series of events, including TC(K) binding, peptidyl. tpt histograms showed Poisson distributions with two rate-limiting steps for both FSmRNA- and SL-programmed ribosomal complexes. the downstream stem loop does not induce noticeable changes on the peptidyl transfer process. 0.58 0.49 1 316 (49%) 1.0 (2.3) 0.55 0.08 2.10 0.34 6.4 1.2 18 4 Mean dwell times were obtained from single exponential decay fittings. last and total for SL and pt for the both mRNAs were obtained from fitting to Poisson distributions with two identical rate-limiting steps. SL = 0.93 0.21 s versus high, FS = 0.52 0.12 s. no substantial difference was observed for the C state dwells. the downstream stem loop effectively destabilizes the H state. G(GTP) for PRESL complexes rapidly lost the Cy5 signals after a single transition to the high, 0.8 EFRET state. the mean duration from the first high, 0.8 EFRET state to the disappearance of the Cy5 signal is 60-fold shorter than the Cy5 half-life (60 s) 76% of the PRESL complex traces were still fluctuating between the C and H states at the same EF-G(GTP) concentration. the percentage of fluctuating PREFS complex traces decreased as EF-G(GTP) concentration increased, but 50% were still fluctuating even at 1 M EF-G(GTP) concentration. tlast for PREFS complexes at 1 M EF-G(GTP) showed a single exponential distribution (last = 6.4 1.2 s) at lower EF-G concentrations, most of the traces photobleached before translocation, preventing accurate measurements of tlast. a proposed reaction scheme based on our observations is shown in Fig. 3A. the C state is probed by the low, 0.2 EFRET state. in contrast, the H, EF-G\u2013bound hybrid (G) and I states are indistinguishably probed. 1.9 0.3 FS 3.6 0.3 1.9 0.5 ND ND 0.20\u20130.48 0.13\u20130.30 ND, kHG and kGH were not determined. kCH = 1/C. kHC = 1/H0 at 0 EF-G. a downstream secondary structure is Crucial for Efficient Frameshifting. bulk in vitro translation showed 70% frameshifted product in FSmRNA. this is consistent with in vitro biochemical studies of frameshifting in the dnaX gene that show approximately 80% frameshifting efficiency (10). SL produced only 4% frameshifted products measured by mass spectrometry. TC(Cy5-K) did not incorporate into initiation complexes, which displayed a valine codon in the slippery sequence. for real-time observations, 250 nM nonfluorophore labeled TC(K) with 0\u20131 M EF-G(GTP) were codelivered to the immobilized POST-(Cy5)K1 at 10 s after starting imaging. tpt is the duration from TC(K) delivery to the first transition to the high EFRET upon peptidyl transfer. tpt is the duration from TC(K) delivery to the first transition to the high EFRET upon peptidyl transfer. the error bars are standard deviations of the means calculated by a block bootstrapping method. tlast of PRESL was described with Poisson distributions with two rate-limiting steps. tlast of PREFS followed a single exponential decay. 0.02 0.52 0.12 0.2 159 (75%) 2.0 0.1 0.33 0.04 1.15 0.39 100

values were corrected for photobleaching rate by 1/total = 1/ total, obs \u20131/photobleaching. the dwell times of the C (low, 0.2 EFRET) and the H (high, 0.8 EFRET) states of the PRE-(Cy5)K1K2 complexes were well described with single exponential decay curves. both PREFS and PRESL complexes showed similar long duration from the first high, 0.8 EFRET state to the disappearance of the Cy5 signal (ttotal), resulting in 60-s Cy5 photobleaching half-lives. 70% of the traces recorded in the presence of 0.2 M EF-G(GTP) for PRESL complexes rapidly lost the Cy5 signals after a single transition to the high, 0.8 EFRET state. fluctuations between the high, 0.8 and low, 0.2 EFRET states in the absence of EF-G are consistent with previous reports that binding of EF-G to PRE complexes stabilizes the H state of the PRE complex. the Poisson distributions of ttotal are consistent with the fact that translocation takes place rapidly. a more than twofold lengthened high was observed in the presence of 0.2 M compared with 0 EF-G(GTP) concentration. the number of transition to the high, 0.8 EFRET state per trace decreased as high increased. tlast for PREFS complexes at 1 M EF-G(GTP) showed a single exponential distribution (last = 6.4 1.2 s) at lower EF-G concentrations, most of the PREFS traces photobleached before completing translocation, preventing accurate measurements of tlast. mRNA kCH, s1* kHC, s1 kHG, s1M1 kGH, s1 kGI, s1 kIP, s1 SL, s1 kGI, s1 kIP, s1 SL, s1 kGI, s1 kIP, s1 SL, mRNA kCH, s1* kHC, s1 kHG, downstream, frameshift-stimulating secondary structures can shift the dynamic conformational equilibrium of ribosomal complexes by modulating the free-energy landscape. the calculated rates of the G-to-I transitions (kGI) and of the I-to-Post transitions (kIP) are much slower than the reaction rates of the PRESL complexes (1.9 0.3 s1) smFRET study showed increased futile EF-G binding events with lengthened dwell times in the presence of antibiotics. results show more severe effects (>10-fold) of stem loop on translocation rate. unlocking of the PRE complex was proposed as a rate-limiting step. repositioning of the P-site tRNA within the 30S subunit pulls the mRNA that is base-paired to the P-site tRNA by 2\u20133 nt in direction of translocation. tension could interfere with the mRNA\u2013tRNA, mRNA\u2013ribosome, tRNA\u2013ribosome, and ribosome\u2013ribosome interactions that are responsible for stabilizing the H state. two universally conserved 16S rRNA bases can intercalate into the mRNA bases in the 30S subunit (43) this interaction has been proposed to play a role in reading frame maintenance during the dynamic conformational changes associated with translocation. the observed intercalation interaction might be impaired in a strained mRNA under the tension that is generated upon swiveling of the 30S head domain. the downstream stem loop elevates the energetic barriers that characterize substeps of the translocation reaction. the energetic barrier to 1 frameshifting becomes lower by the amount of destabilization of the H state with or without EF-G bound. 0.30 s1) are much slower than the reaction rates of the PRESL complexes (1.9 0.3 s1) the results indicate that the frameshifting stimulatory stem loop elevated the energetic barriers for the G-to-I and I-to-Post transitions along the translocation process of PREFS complexes. repositioning of the P-site tRNA within the 30S subunit pulls the mRNA that is base-paired to the P-site tRNA by 2\u20133 nt in direction of translocation. this pulling of the mRNA that is base-paired to the P-site tRNA will exert mechanical force against the downstream secondary structure (42) tension could interfere with the mRNA\u2013tRNA, mRNA\u2013ribosome, tRNA\u2013ribosome, and ribosome\u2013ribosome interactions that are responsible for stabilizing the H state. tension developed in the H state could also impair the ability of EF-G domain IV to form critical interactions with the A site of the 30S subunit for the efficient translocation. a 1 frameshift constitutes an alternative path that the ribosome can adopt when it encounters a 1PRF signal. in the dnaX gene, 1 frameshifting results in base pairs for both P- and A-site tRNALys (A AAA AAG versus AAA AAA G), providing a small energetic gain to the frameshifted conformation. mRNAs were prepared by in vitro run off transcriptions on synthetic DNAs using T7 promoter. diluted POST-V complexes were immobilized to a PEG-passivated flowcell via streptavidin\u2013biotin interactions."}
