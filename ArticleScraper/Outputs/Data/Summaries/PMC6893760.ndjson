{"summary": "peV-A virion is approximately 30 nm in diameter and is composed of a RNA genome shielded by an outer protein capsid lacking a lipid envelope. the 700 nt 5\u2032UTR forms primary and secondary RNA structures that are crucial for replication and is attached to a viral protein. the atomic structures of PeV-A have revealed several features uncommon among other picornaviruses. the peV-A capsid surface is relatively flat and misses the classic hydrophobic VP1 pocket. a total of 12 pentamers result in the final icosahedron defined by three axes of symmetry. genus is comprised of four species, Parechovirus A, Parechovirus B (formerly named Ljungan virus), Parechovirus C (Sebokele virus), and Parechovirus D (ferret parechovirus) Species PeV-A contains virus genotypes that can infect humans and cause severe disease such as meningoencephalitis, seizures, or sepsis-like illness. study group website. type Strain Reference Accession PeV-A1A Harris Hyypia et al., 1992 [22] L02971 PeV-A1B BNI-788 St Baumgarte et al., 2008 [23] EF051629 PeV-A2 Williamson Ghazi et al., 1998 [24] AJ005695 PeV-A3 A308/99 Ito et al., 2004 [25 recombination plays an important role in PeV-A evolution. recombination has been shown to occur frequently between PeV-A1, A4, A5, and A6, with breakpoints mainly located at both ends of the structural VP1 region [21,35,36]. recombination has been shown to occur frequently between PeV-A1, A4, A5, and A6, with breakpoints mainly located at both ends of the structural VP1 region and at the VP2/VP3 junction region. the location of recombination breakpoints seems to correlate to the genetic diversity in the PeV-A genome. remarkably high prevalence (23\u201357%) was recently demonstrated for PeV-A in children from Malawi. PeV-A1 is most prevalent followed by PeV-A3 and PeV-A4, while PeV-A2 and A7-A19 are rarely reported. a higher diversity of genotypes has been reported in India and Pakistan. seroepidemiological studies determine the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against a specific pathogen in sera of a defined population. seropositivity of PeV-A1 nAbs sharply increases in children aged two to five years and is nearly universal in adults. the new RNA can serve as a template for replications or be translated into a large polyprotein. this polyprotein is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins. the final stage of the peV-A life cycle is the release from the host cell. nt divergence in the receptor binding capsid VP1-encoding sequence is used to subgroup PeV-A into the 19 detected genotypes. some of these genotypes contain an integrin-binding tripeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif in the VP1 C terminus. v3 and v6 integrin heterodimers were involved in peV-A1 infection. v6 ITG is the high affinity receptor for peV-A1. integrins facilitate peV-A1 infection but the use of specific heterodimers may be cell line dependent. peV-A1 (with RGD in VP1) and PeV-A3 (RGD-less) preferentially infect basal cells from the basolateral surface. either, these closely related viruses are utilizing separate receptors to gain entry into the same cell type or perhaps they share a yet unidentified receptor. beta-2-microglobulin (2M) is a component of the antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex I (MHC 1). the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was shown to be a pan-echovirus receptor. loss of 2M expression renders cells resistant to echovirus infection. the exact receptors used by PeV-A remain an open question. several groups have investigated the role of v ITG heterodimers in peV-A1 infection. integrin-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) indicated v3 ITG as the primary peV-A1 receptor. v6 ITG as the high affinity receptor for peV-A1. we showed that heparin sulfate (HS) is involved in peV-A1 infection in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line [88]. however, we could not confirm the role of HS in the HAE model. peV-A infection is presumed to occur via fecal-oral and respiratory routes based on similarities to infection routes of EVs and PeV-A detection in stool and nasopharyngeal samples [92]. clinical manifestations following peV-A infection range from mild symptoms to severe disease. peV-A1 is associated with acute gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and rash in children between 6 months to 5 years. several outbreaks of neonatal sepsis-like illness due to peV-A3 infection have also been recorded, most recently in australia [96,97,98,99,100] the peV-A genotype is determined by the partial or complete sequencing of the VP-1 encoding region. the genotype is determined by the partial or complete sequencing of the VP-1 encoding region. peV-A3 needs different cell lines than the other PeVs. peV-A3 induced a significantly stronger activation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. the role of T-cell immunity in picornavirus infection is not well-defined. ant epitopes include the N-terminal region of the PeV-A1 VP0 capsid encoding region and VP0/VP3 loops on the capsid surface. maternal nAbs protect neonates against infection related to most PeV-A genotypes, but peV-A3 is again an exception. peV-As can be detected in feces, NP swabs, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most peV-A epidemiological studies are performed using feces samples from children younger than 5 years of age, presenting with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis [38,45,47,113,114]. in case of peV-A1, TLR7, and TLR8 are important in recognizing the single stranded RNA early in the infection. this recognition activates the NF- signaling pathway and ultimately leads to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). rabbits immunized with peptide antigen corresponding to the VP1 region elicited nAbs against PeV-A1 [57,62] nAbs targeting the RGD motif cross neutralize other PeV-A genotypes (PeV-A2 and PeV-A4 to A6) that contain this motif. the most striking feature of PeV-A3 infection is the severity in its clinical manifestation. both the innate and adaptive immune responses have been shown to be different for PeV-A3 as opposed to the more prevalent PeV-A1. peV-A3 positive CSF samples often do not show increase in white blood cell count. however, peV-A3 isolates replicated human neuroblastoma cell lines more efficiently than PeV-A1. this suggests a neural tropism of PeV-A3. our group showed that PeV-A3 induced a much stronger activation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. this strong activation could result in severe immunopathology. this is supported by the fact that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and systemic inflammatory response have been linked. titers of peV-A3 nAbs are below the expected levels of protection in adults over 30 years. this is further supported by the lack of neutralization of PeV-A3 in a small serosurvey of adults from Wisconsin, USA. peV-A replication due to differences in the capsid structures. EV 3C protease, EV 2C inhibitors, and golgi transport inhibitor failed to inhibit replication. another host factor-targeting compound, the antifungal agent Itraconazole (ITZ), was shown to have antiviral activity against PeV-A3 but not against PeV-A1 [152]. newborn mice and cynomolgus monkeys have been experimentally infected with PeV-A1 and newborn mice with PeV-A3 but with no apparent pathologies associated. the identification of a peV-A receptor is critical and may lead to the generation of a transgenic animal model. a recent breakthrough in similarly culturing the gut epithelium using stem cells from intestinal crypts could also be used for studying PeV-A. future research should also aim to characterize molecular and cellular determinants of PeV-A immune modulation across various tissues in both infants and adults."}
