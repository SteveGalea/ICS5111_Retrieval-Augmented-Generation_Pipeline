{"summary": "some features of the global SARS epidemic are worth recalling. some include the initial lack of field investigative capacity, reference laboratory testing, and reporting transparency from southern China. a 3-month delay in the reporting of the severe unexplained illness to WHO; the role played by an alert clinician in Hanoi, Vietnam. spread to health care workers and family members was a critical aspect of the amplification of the epidemic during January 2003. initial laboratory investigations incorrectly focused on a possible Chlamydia spp.\u2013like organism as the etiologic agent (http://english.peopledaily.com.cn). Several superspreading events contributed to the spread of the virus. Known secondary SARS cases were associated with at least 13 (42%) of 31 guest rooms on the ninth floor, resulting in a case-fatality ratio of 15%. the high rate of infection among guests staying on the ninth floor is remarkable because they did not have direct contact with the index case-patient. superspreading events in health care settings, during an airplane flight, and in an apartment complex. this process of environmental contamination that generated infectious aerosols likely best explains the pattern of disease transmission at the hotel Metropole. these events underscore the potential for aerosol transmission in non-health care settings. the spread of SARS was initiated by unrecognized transmission of the virus in health care facilities. in both places, the spread of SARS was initiated by unrecognized transmission in health care facilities. however, the outbreaks progressed differently. unrecognized transmission of SARS in a hospital laundry worker ignited an explosive outbreak that spread to other hospitals and the community. more than 1,000 people were quarantined; some tossed soft drink bottles from windows with protest messages, others communicated the disarray within the facility through cell phone messages. public health officials rapidly pivoted in control policies and community response actions to prevent a potential emerging infectious disease catastrophe. new national public health agencies have been created in Canada and the united kingdom. the global disease Detection Program was established at CDC. the international association of national public health institutes has been created. the white house recently released the first national strategy for biosurveillance. it calls for an all-hazards approach to achieve early detection and situational awareness to enable better decision making. many disease detection and control improvements have been implemented in the past 10 years, but important gaps in global capacity remain. as we reflect on lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak, we need to avoid complacency; strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic. we must strive to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges."}
