{"summary": "human oncogenic Viruses are intracellular parasites that strictly depend on a host to replicate. for the host, the consequences of viral infection span a wide range from being asymptomatic to causing deadly disease. despite this substantial number, the list of human viruses that are clearly involved in the etiology of human tumors is rather short. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) may modulate the carcinogenic phenotype of cancers, in particular glioblastoma. the clinical significance of the presence of HCMV sequences in these tumors remains controversial. infections with one of the established human tumor viruses are associated with a majority or at least a significant percentage of the respective cancers.

HBx increased LC3-lipidation and VPS34 activity incomplete autophagic response may inhibit autophagy [28] HBx interacts with p53 may inhibit autophagy [28] HBx p38 activation may inhibit autophagy [29] HBx/LHBs/MHBs ERK activation may inhibit autophagy [30,31,32] NS3/NS5A interact with p53 may inhibit autophagy [46] NS3 interacts with IRGM increases autophagic markers [47] NS4B activation of UPR signaling autophagic markers [48] NS4B interacts with Rab5 and VPS34 incomplete autophagic response [48] NS5A PI3K/mTOR activation may inhibit autophagy [49,50] NS5A PKR inhibition may inhibit autophagy [53 JNK inhibition may inhibit autophagy [67] E7 \" autophagic markers [68] Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) Retroviridae Adult T-cell leukemia Tax JNK activation may promote autophagy [69] Tax sustained AKT/mTORC1 activity may inhibit autophagy [70,71] Tax inhibits p53 may inhibit autophagy [73] Tax+HBZ NF-B activation may inhibit autophagy [78,79, vGPCR PI3K/mTORC1 activation may inhibit autophagy [97] vIRF2/vIRF3 PKR inhibition may inhibit autophagy [98,99] vIRF3 NF-B inhibition. ERK, JNK and p38 modulate or modulate autophagy via pathways other than NF-kB. many tumor viruses encode proteins that promote cell cycle entry, counteract programmed cell death, subvert cellular differentiation and/or interfere with immune signaling. many of the cellular pathways targeted by these viruses can contribute to carcinogenesis. autophagy is a key homeostatic process conserved across all eukaryotic cells. autophagy primarily represents a pro-survival mechanism, but in complex multicellular organisms, it serves additional purposes, including a role in adaptive and innate immunity. autophagy has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac disease, liver disease, myopathies, cancer and bacterial and viral infection. autophagy may play an especially multifaceted role in virus-associated malignancies since it has pro- and anti-tumorigenic as well as pro- at least three biochemically and functionally distinct class III PI3K-complexes in mammalian cells share a common core comprising VPS34 and ATG6/Beclin-1. the third complex, in which the core is associated with UVRAG and RUN domain and cysteine-rich domain containing Beclin-1 interacting protein (Rubicon) inhibits autophagosome and endosome maturation. 5-ATG12 conjugate is localized to the expanding autophagosomal membrane by ATG16L. conjugation of LC3 further requires proteolytic processing by ATG4, as well as the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and another E2-like enzyme, ATG3 [117]. some substrates are marked for autophagic degradation by ubiquitination. the eight established human tumor viruses interfere with a variety of host cell signaling pathways, including immune signaling pathways and pathways regulating cell growth and survival. the eight established human tumor viruses interfere with a variety of host cell signaling pathways, including immune signals and pathways regulating cell growth and survival. autophagy contributes to host defense in at least three ways. it targets pathogens for lysosomal degradation in a process that is also referred to as xenophagy. autophagy facilitates presentation of viral antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-molecules. autophagy-mediated presentation on MHC class II has been described in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) for antigen peptides derived from the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). however, EBNA1-derived antigen processing via the autophagy-MHC class II-route appears to be epitope specific, and occurs only at a very low level. this may be due to the fact that EBNA1 localizes to the nucleus PKR phosphorylates the -subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which inhibits translation of host cell and viral mRNAs and stimulates autophagy. PKR is clearly required for autophagy-induction in response to HSV-1 infection [140], yet several other viruses also encode proteins that inhibit PKR signaling. the literature on HCV and autophagy is particularly controversial in many respects. it is not clear whether HCV genotypes indeed differ in their ability to induce autophagy [145] or not. a prominent example among the human tumor-associated viruses is provided by HCV. poliovirus, dengue virus and mouse hepatitis virus subvert the autophagy machinery to promote their life cycles. colocalization of viral proteins or RNA with markers of autophagy-related vesicles has been observed. in case of HCV, currently available data varies with regard to whether and in which stage of infection there is colocalization of viral replication factors. study by Vescovo et al. suggests partial explanation for this discrepancies. vFLIP inhibition of autophagy contributes to maintenance of latency. vBcl-2 expression increases early in the lytic phase. autophagy-mediated presentation on MHC class II-molecules has been described in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) for antigen peptides derived from the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) [125,126,127] autophagy-mediated presentation on MHC class II has been originally described in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) for antigen peptides derived from the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) [125,126,127 antigen processing via the autophagy-MHC class II-route appears to be epitope specific, and occurs only at a very low level. the latter may be due to the fact that EBNA1 localizes to the nucleus where it seems to be largely protected from autophagy. this has only been reported during late stages of herpes simplex virus 1 infection in macrophages [130] the precise molecular events that lead to increased autophagy downstream of eIF2 are currently unknown. PKR is clearly required for autophagy-induction in response to HSV-1 infection. several other viruses also encode proteins that inhibit PKR signaling. antigen-processing or xenophagy are mediated by the autophagy machinery. a prominent example among the human tumor-associated viruses is provided by HCV. a prominent example among the human tumor-associated viruses is provided by HCV. poliovirus, dengue virus and mouse hepatitis virus subvert the autophagy machinery to promote their life cycles. this is consistent with the model that the membranes of these vesicles provide a scaffold for the viral replication complex. however, currently available data varies with regard to whether and in which stage of infection there is colocalization of viral replication factors with autophagosome-like vesicular membranes. the study by Vescovo et al. suggests a partial explanation for this discrepancies. in KSHV infection, viral particles are produced only in the lytic phase. overexpression of the replication and transcription activator, RTA, increases LC3 conversion. beclin-1 was discovered in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for interaction partners of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 [88] beclin-1 was the first mammalian Atg protein to be identified and the first Atg protein that was established as a tumor suppressor [118]. vBcl-2 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), which causes disruption of the cBcl- cBcl-2 disrupts the Beclin-1/UVRAG complex, whereas vBcl-2 does not. vBcl-2 forms a higher order Beclin-1/UVRAG/vBcl-2 complex [161] cBcl-2 disrupts the Beclin-1/UVRAG complex, whereas vBcl-2 does not. vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. both vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. the ability to interact with ATG3 was required for inhibition of cell death associated with autophagy. autophagy is activated above basal levels in response to diverse stressors such as nutrient- or growth factor deprivation, hypoxia, ER- and redox stress, organelle damage or pathogen infection. the precise molecular links between these pathways and the autophagy machinery have not yet been fully elucidated. mTORC1 supports cell growth by activating mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis. inhibition of mTORC1 and its counterparts in other organisms is sufficient to activate autophagy even in the presence of nutrients. autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 was identified as an mTORC1-substrate. the figure gives a simplified overview of the cell\u2019s nutrient and growth factor-regulated signaling pathways. the PI3K pathway and its important signaling mediators AKT, the TSC1/2 GTPase activating complex for the GTPase Rheb, which activates mTORC1 and mTORC1. interactions of these pathways with the p53 tumor suppressor are also shown. no general consensus in literature on activation/inhibition, outcome may be cell type specific. EBV LMP1 mimics a ligand-independent, constitutively active CD40 receptor [183] and is sufficient for transformation of rodent cells. multiple KSHV-proteins have been implicated in activation of PI3K-, AKT- and/or mTOR signaling. vGPCR signals to mTORC1 via PI3K [97], a PI3K isoform that is expressed in white blood and endothelial cells. mTORC1 signaling may in turn promote expression of the latent-to-lytic switch master regulator RTA [176] mTOR signaling suppresses viral replication, even though the virus can increase mTOR activity. the NS5A protein may play an important role in this. it has been reported to activate mTORC1 signaling via both PI3K-AKT-dependent and independent mechanisms. new studies are required to define the mechanism by which HPV E7 expression activates the autophagy machinery. it has been speculated that it may arise as a consequence of metabolic stress. it will be interesting to investigate if autophagy is deregulated in cervical cancer cells, which co-express the HTLV-1 oncoproteins. ERK (a MAPK) is activated by MEK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) RAF is typically activated by the small GTPase Ras downstream of receptor tyrosine protein kinases. many effects of ERK signaling are cell type and context dependent [212] and this may include its role in autophagy regulation. protein K15 activates the ERK pathway via HBx and the large and middle surface antigens [30,31,32,51,61,220,221,222] and HPV via its E6 and E7 oncoproteins. AMPK-signaling The AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK, is a major cellular energy sensor and may positively regulate autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1. expression of simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) has been demonstrated to inhibit cell death in glucose deprived cultured cells by activating AMPK and increasing autophagy. however, whether small T antigens of other polyomaviruses, such as that of the carcinogenic MCPyV can also activate AMPK remains to be determined. AMPK- and mTOR signaling have opposing effects on cell physiology. mTOR is also a negative regulator of HCV-replication, and its inhibition should favor HCV replication. this suggests that AMPK and mTOR inhibit HCV-replication through different molecular mechanisms. p38 kinase is a negative regulator of both basal and starvation induced autophagy. it modulates trafficking of the putative membrane carrier protein mAtg9 [102] p38 kinase is a negative regulator of both basal and starvation induced autophagy. p53 induces transcription of genes that positively regulate autophagy. p53-target genes promote autophagy by interacting with TIGAR. p53-target genes inhibit autophagy by decreasing ROS-levels. p53-inactivation presumably consists in abrogation of p53-dependent apoptotic response. p53 was originally discovered through its interaction with SV40 large T antigen [257] there is no evidence that MCPyV large T antigen associates with p53. NF-B signaling nuclear factor B transcription factors are executing the biological activities of multiple stress-sensitive signaling pathways. non-canonical NF-B activation involves NF-B-inducible kinase (NIK) mediated activation of IKK homodimers, which then phosphorylate the NF-B2/p100 precursor. this allows proteolytic processing of p100 to p52 which associates with RelB to form a functional transcription factor complex that enters the nucleus. a recent study suggested that NF-B signaling can be activated in parallel with autophagy by pro-autophagic stimuli via a mechanism that involves the TAK1. there is complex and reciprocal regulation of NF-B signaling and autophagy. NF-B-regulating kinase IKK can promote autophagy independently of the transcription factor NF-B. AMPK and JNK appeared to be important downstream mediators of IKK. NF-B signaling plays a central role throughout the entire life cycle of the human tumor viruses. RF3 acts as a suppressor [93,100] in the literature. there is no evidence that HBV and HCV modulate autophagy through these pathways. NF-B is constitutively activated, predominantly via the non-canonical pathway. HTLV-1 encoded basic leucine zipper transcription factor HBZ selectively interferes with the canonical pathway. autophagy was found to inhibit NF-B signaling when HTLV-1 transformed cells and ATL-cell lines were treated with Geldanamycin. this was suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for ATL. d XBP1-mRNA (XBP1u) upregulates expression of UPR target genes. ER stress triggers processing of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ER stress activates PKR-like eIF2 kinase (PERK) which phosphorylates eIF2. kinase of Beclin-1 and PERK-mediated NF-B activation. events downstream of JNK-activation contribute to autophagy-modulation. this suggests that XBP1 suppresses autophagy. NF-B- and PERK-elF2 signaling by LMP1 are independent and require different domains of LMP1. ER stress caused by high levels of LMP1 is the trigger for autophagy upregulation. this pro-autophagic function of LMP1 when expressed at high levels is not inconsistent with a more recent study. two studies provide evidence that activators of the three UPR signaling pathways, PERK, ATF6 and IRE1, as well as a PERK-target gene, the transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) play an important role upstream of the HCV-induced autophagy-like process in promoting viral replication [142,146] interaction affects basal- or stress-induced autophagy in HTLV1-infected cells. beclin-1 was the first mammalian Atg protein to be identified. vBcl-2 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). cBcl-2 disrupts the Beclin-1/UVRAG complex, whereas vBcl-2 does not. vBcl-2 forms a higher order Beclin-1/UVRAG/vBcl-2 complex [161]. the precise molecular events by which vBcl-2 inhibits autophagy remain to be determined. vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. both vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. the ability to interact with ATG3 was required for inhibition of cell death associated with autophagy. beclin-1 was found in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for interaction partners of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 [88] beclin-1 was the first mammalian Atg protein to be identified and the first Atg protein that was established as a tumor suppressor. cBcl-2 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), which causes disruption of the cBcl-2/Beclin cBcl-2 disrupts the Beclin-1/UVRAG complex, whereas vBcl-2 does not. vBcl-2 forms a higher order Beclin-1/UVRAG/vBcl-2 complex [161]. cBcl-2 may inhibit Beclin-1 dependent autophagy by different mechanisms. vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. both vFLIP and cFLIP were found to bind the autophagy-protein ATG3 competitively with LC3. the ability to interact with ATG3 was required for inhibition of cell death associated with autophagy. autophagy is activated above basal levels in response to diverse stressors such as nutrient- or growth factor deprivation, hypoxia, ER- and redox stress, organelle damage or pathogen infection. the precise molecular links between these pathways and the autophagy machinery have not yet been fully elucidated. decreased AMPK signaling and availability of amino acids also activate mTORC1. mTORC1 supports cell growth by activating mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis. inhibition of mTORC1 and its counterparts in other organisms is sufficient to activate autophagy even in the presence of nutrients. the PI3K pathway and its important signaling mediators AKT, the TSC1/2 GTPase activating complex for the GTPase Rheb, which activates mTORC1 and mTORC1. the RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK-module and (3) the AMPK pathway are also shown. no general consensus in literature on activation/inhibition, outcome may be cell type specific. EBV LMP1 mimics a ligand-independent, constitutively active CD40 receptor. the viral G-protein coupled receptor homolog (vGPCR) signals to mTORC1 via PI3K [97], a PI3K isoform that is expressed in white blood and endothelial cells. vGPCR signaling to mTORC1 drives endothelial cell proliferation [195] and mTORC1 signaling may in turn promote expression of the latent-to-lytic switch master regulator RTA. mTOR signaling suppresses viral replication, even though the virus can increase mTOR activity. NS5A was found to be phosphorylated in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. other HCV proteins activating AKT signaling include NS4B and core. the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax allows for sustained AKT phosphorylation under low serum conditions. the HTLV-1 oncoprotein tax allows for sustained AKT phosphorylation under low serum conditions. this may be due to tax interacting with the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K. ERK signaling contributes to mTORC1 activation, which suppresses autophagy [104] ERK-substrate 90 kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK) can inhibit death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a potential positive regulator of Beclin-1 dependent autophagy [213,214] ERK and RSK can inhibit the Ser/Thr-kinase LKB1 [215] and HBV activates the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway via HBx and the large and middle surface antigens [30,31,32,51,61,220,221,222] and HPV via its oncoproteins. evidence has been provided that core and NS3 activate ERK signaling [37,38] while NS5A may suppress this pathway [50,51] expression of simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) small T antigen has been demonstrated to inhibit cell death in glucose deprived cultured cells by activating AMPK and increasing autophagy. however, whether small T antigens of other polyomaviruses, such as that of the carcinogenic MCPyV can also activate AMPK remains to be determined. AMPK activation, for example, decreases HCV-replication, should result in mTOR-inhibition. but mTOR is also a negative regulator of HCV-replication, and its inhibition should favor HCV replication. this suggests that AMPK and mTOR inhibit HCV-replication. p38 kinase is a negative regulator of both basal and starvation induced autophagy. it modulates trafficking of the putative membrane carrier protein mAtg9 [102] p38 kinase is a negative regulator of both basal and starvation induced autophagy and modulates trafficking of the putative membrane carrier protein mAtg9. p53-target genes promote autophagy by interacting with TIGAR. p53-target genes inhibit autophagy by decreasing ROS-levels. cytoplasmic p53 mutants inhibit autophagy by interacting with FIP200. HTLV-1 Tax also inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. p53 was originally discovered through its interaction with SV40 large T antigen. there is no evidence that p53 associates with p53. non-canonical NF-B activation involves NF-B-inducible kinase (NIK) mediated activation of IKK homodimers, which then phosphorylate the NF-B2/p100 precursor. this allows proteolytic processing of p100 to p52 which associates with RelB to form a functional transcription factor complex that enters the nucleus. a recent study suggested that NF-B signaling can be activated in parallel with autophagy by pro-autophagic stimuli via a mechanism that involves the TAK1-binding proteins 2 and 3 (TAB2/3) there is complex and reciprocal regulation of NF-B signaling. NF-B-regulating kinase IKK can promote autophagy independently of the transcription factor NF-B. AMPK and JNK appeared to be important downstream mediators of IKK in this context. NF-B pathway is a common target of several human tumor viruses. the effect of KSHV K1 on NF-B activity is controversial in the literature. there is evidence that HBV HBx and a truncated form of the middle surface antigen (MHBst) can activate NF-B-dependent transcription. this may contribute to enhanced tumor burden in MHBst transgenic mice. LV-1 encoded leucine zipper transcription factor HBZ selectively interferes with the canonical pathway. autophagy was found to inhibit NF-B signaling when HTLV-1 transformed cells and ATL-cell lines were treated with Geldanamycin. this was suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for ATL [278]. the product of the unspliced XBP1-mRNA (XBP1u) acts as a transcriptional repressor. in the second branch, ER stress triggers processing of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ER stress activates PKR-like eIF2 kinase (PERK) which phosphorylates eIF2. XBP1 suppresses autophagy and gives rise to the hypothesis that the XBP1 branch of the UPR functions to prevent excessive autophagy upon ER stress. PERK-dependent phosphorylation of elF2 and activation of ATF4 increased LMP1 expression. lF2 signaling by LMP1 are independent and require different domains of LMP1. it is tempting to speculate that in fact ER stress caused by high levels of LMP1 is the trigger for autophagy upregulation. this pro-autophagic function of LMP1 when expressed at high levels is not inconsistent with a recent study. a PERK-target gene, the transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), play an important role upstream of the HCV-induced autophagy-like process in promoting viral replication [142,146] and in suppressing the antiviral immune response [142,146] additional studies are required to elucidate how HCV perturbs UPR signaling and autophagy in infected cells. mTOR-complex 1 (mTORC1) acts downstream of growth factor receptors. erK signaling, decreased AMPK signaling and availability of amino acids also activate mTORC1. inhibition of mTORC1 and its counterparts in other organisms is sufficient to activate autophagy even in the presence of nutrients [172] autophagy dysregulation by this pathway may be common in virus-associated malignancies. all known human tumor viruses appear to interfere with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, most likely to exploit growth- and survival promoting function of these pathways. details on how viral proteins interfere with nutrient- and growth factor-regulated signaling pathways are discussed in the text. HCV NS5A does not directly target mTOR but its regulator FKBP38 [200] and may inhibit ERK signaling by interacting with GRB2. the second EBV encoded transmembrane protein, LMP2 [187], is dispensable for B cell immortalization in vitro [188] but it appears to enhance LMP1\u2019s ability to promote carcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model [189] multiple KSHV-proteins have been implicated in activation of PI3K-, AKT- and/or mTOR signaling. vGPCR signals to mTORC1 via PI3K [97], mTORC1 activates PI3K-, AKT- and mTOR signaling in both B lymphocytes [78] and endothelial cells [79,80] via its K1 protein, a constitutively active B-cell receptor homolog. mTOR signaling suppresses viral replication even though the virus can increase mTOR activity. in cells expressing the HPV oncoprotein E6, mTORC1-activity is sustained even under conditions of growth factor deprivation [58,59] studies conducted in a physiologically relevant cellular system suggest that this is due to E6 sustaining the activity of AKT, which stimulates mTORC1 [59] ERK signaling contributes to mTORC1 activation, which suppresses autophagy. ERK-substrate 90 kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase can inhibit death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a potential positive regulator of Beclin-1 dependent autophagy. ERK may modulate autophagy via RSK-dependent activation of NF-B signaling. AMPK is a major cellular energy sensor and may positively regulate autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1 (for reviews, see [104,216]). AMPK associates with and phosphorylates autophagy machinery. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 is required for correct intracellular localization of mAtg9, a putative membrane carrier protein. AMPK activity is modulated by the cellular ATP/AMP ratio and requires phosphorylation by an upstream kinase, such as LKB1, CamKK or potentially TAK1, which also plays an important role in NF-B activation. AMPK- and mTOR signaling have opposing effects on cell physiology. mTOR is also a negative regulator of HCV-replication, and its inhibition should favor HCV replication. this suggests that AMPK- and mTOR inhibit HCV-replication. studies are required to further characterize the profound changes in the host cell signaling pathways that are suggested by the currently available data. viral oncoproteins upregulating p38 signaling include EBV LMP1 [17,21], KSHV vGPCR [86], K15 [81] and ORF49 [85], the HBV protein HBx [37,38], the HPV E5 protein [56], the HPV E5 protein [37,38] and HTLV-1 Tax [69] nuclear p53 induces transcription of genes that positively regulate autophagy. p53 activates negative regulators of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. p53 inhibits autophagy by decreasing ROS-levels under conditions of nutrient starvation or metabolic stress. HPV E6 recruits the host cell encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A (E6AP) to target p53 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. the immediate benefit of E6-mediated p53-inactivation for the virus presumably consists in abrogation of the p53-dependent apoptotic response. NF-B transcription factors function as homo- or heterodimers formed by the five proteins of the NF-B/Rel-family. NF-B1/p50 is generated by proteolytic cleavage of its precursor p100, RelA/p65, RelB and c-Rel. the canonical NF-B pathway is triggered by B-cell-, T-cell, cytokine-, growth factor- or Toll-like receptor signal specific tumor virus derived surface antigens/pathogen associate molecular patterns (PAMPs) activating the immune receptors shown in this figure have been omitted for clarity. HTLV-1 Tax and KSHV vFLIP interact with IKK and stimulate p100 expression and processing independently of NIK. NF-B suppressed TNF-, but not starvation-induced autophagy in Ewing sarcomacells. NF-B signaling plays a central role throughout the entire life cycle of the -herpesviruses EBV and KSHV. no studies have implicated activation of NF-B signaling by vFLIP. EBV and KSHV express additional regulators of NF-B signaling. vFLIP was shown to inhibit autophagy by targeting ATG3 [90] no evidence that HBV and HCV modulate autophagy through these pathways. the E7 oncoprotein mediate the resistance to TNF and TGF-induced growth inhibition [64,65] and suppress TNF-induced NF-B-activation when expressed in cervical epithelial cells. the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. each branch involves an ER transmembrane protein that senses the protein folding status in the ER and transduces this information to the cytosol. the bifunctional inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) oligomerizes and autophosphorylates and thus activates its endoribonuclease activity. eIF2 phosphorylation at the PERK-target site, S51, is also required for autophagy in response to other stressors, including viral infection. additional mechanisms of autophagy induction by ER stress may include IRE1 signaling to JNK [286], a known kinase of Beclin-1. ectopic expression of the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 causes ER stress and activates all three arms of the UPR. PERK-dependent phosphorylation of elF2 and activation of ATF4 increased LMP1 expression. however, vast variations in LMP1 levels have been observed in clonal lymphoblast populations. in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that HCV-infection activates upstream regulators in all three branches of the UPR. but this does not lead to the induction of UPR-responsive genes. HTLV-1 via its Tax-protein upregulates XBP1 transcription (but not splicing) in unstressed cells. ER stress did not increase HTLV1-expression despite increasing XBP1-transcription and splicing. autophagy is emerging as an important defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses. only very few tumor virus proteins have been demonstrated to interact directly with autophagy-regulating proteins. many studies reporting interference with upstream signaling pathways capable of modulating autophagy did not explicitly examine potential effects on autophagy."}
