{"summary": "coronaviruses were classified into three groups. group 1 and 2 are composed of mammalian coronaviruses and group 3 avian coronaviruses. phylogenetic methods have also enabled the classification of SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) four other mammalian coronaviruses, including MHV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and one avian coronavirus (IBV) 15 previously unrecognized coronaviruses were discovered. avian coronaviruses possess the largest genomes [26.4 kb (ThCoV HKU12) to 31.7 kb (SW1)] among all known RNA viruses. the large genome has given this family of virus extra plasticity in accommodating and modifying genes. transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif is present at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence preceding most ORFs. the TRS motifs are thought to be important for a \u201ccopy-choice\u201d mechanism that mediates the unique random template switching during RNA replication, resulting in a high frequency of homologous RNA recombination in coronaviruses. miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (NC_010438); Mi-BatCoV 1A, Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A (NC_010437); Mi-BatCoV 1B, Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A (NC_010436); HCoV-OC43, human coronavirus OC43 (NC_005147); BCoV, bovine coronavirus (NC_003045); PHEV munia coronavirus HKU13 (NC_011549); munia coronavirus HKU13 (NC_011550); munia coronavirus HKU13 (NC_011549); munia coronavirus HKU13 (NC_011550); nsp in ORF1ab No. of papain-like proteases in ORF1ab No. of small ORFs between ORF1ab and N Presence of conserve CUAAAC 16 2 3 Y - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus Pigs 0.37 CUAAAC 16 2 2 Y - Mouse hepatitis virus Mice 0.42 CUAAAC 16 2 2 Y - Subgroup B Human SARS related coronavirus Humans 0.41 ACGAAC 16 1 7 N - SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU3 Chinese horseshoe bats 0. replicase polyprotein is cleaved by papain-like protease(s) (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), proteins encoded by ORF1ab of the coronavirus genome, at consensus cleavage sites, into 15 to 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) named nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, etc. bioinformatics analysis of some other nsps revealed putative functions. downstream to PLpro or PL1pro in nsp3 is the X domain. ADRP and its functionally related enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPDase) were important for tRNA processing. a haemagglutinin esterase gene encodes a glycoprotein with neuraminate O-acetyl-esterase activity and the active site FGDS. the HE gene of coronavirus is believed to be acquired from influenza C virus. the presence of HE genes exclusively in members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A suggests that the recombination had probably occurred in the ancestor of members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A. all coronaviruses, most of the S protein is exposed on the outside of the virus, with a short transmembrane domain at the C terminus, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues. at the moment, no bioinformatics tool is available for accurate prediction of the receptor. the most significant difference between human SARSr-CoV and civet SARSr-CoV genomes was a 29-bp deletion in the ORF8 of human SARSr-CoV. the replicase polyprotein is cleaved by papain-like protease(s) (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), proteins encoded by ORF1ab of the coronavirus genome, at consensus cleavage sites the genomes of all known members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus subgroup A possess two PLpro (PL1pro and PL2pro), while those of all known members of Betacoronavirus subgroup B, C and D and Gammacoronavirus possess only one PLpro. bioinformatics analysis of some other nsps revealed their putative functions. a putative poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) domain and a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MT) domain of the RrmJ family are enzymes in RNA processing pathways. exoN, XendoU and 2\u2032-O-MT are enzymes in a small nucleolar RNA the S proteins are used for receptor binding and viral entry. in some coronaviruses, the S proteins are cleaved into the S1 and S2 domains at consensus cleavage site. most of the S protein is exposed on the outside of the virus. small ORFs present between conserved genes in different lineages in the Coronaviridae family. most of these small ORFs are of unknown function. one exception is the small ORFs downstream to N. cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of consensus sequences for Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus [28]. phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) of coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available. tree was constructed by neighbor-joining method and rooted using Breda virus polyprotein (YP_337905). the scale bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per 20 amino acids. all abbreviations for the coronaviruses were the same as those in Figure 1. the S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 is the shortest among S proteins. a common evolutionary origin in the S protein of SARSr-CoV, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV and Rh-BatCoV HKU2 may have acquired its unique S protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombination. the mutation rate of TGEV to be 7104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. one group, using the helicase gene for analysis, estimates the life history of coronaviruses to be as short as about 420 years [35] one group, using the helicase gene for analysis, has estimated the life history of coronaviruses to be as short as about 420 years. the rate for variable sites is 35104. the rate for variable sites is 35104. the best documented example of generation of coronavirus species through homologous RNA recombination is the generation of FCoV type II by double recombination between FCoV type I and CCoV type II. the best documented example of generation of coronavirus species through homologous RNA recombination is the generation of FCoV type II by double recombination between FCoV and CCoV type I. ination region in the Pol gene was also discovered, and it was concluded that FCoV type II originated from two recombination events between the genomes of CCoV and FCoV type I. the best documented example is HCoV-HKU1. the possibility of homologous RNA recombination was first suspected when a few strains of HCoV-HKU1 showed differential clustering. coronavirus genomes are markedly suppressed. cytosine deamination is also observed in all the 19 coronavirus genomes. this force is probably unrelated to the relative abundance of tRNA molecules. HCoV-HKU1 was the only coronavirus that had effective number of codons outside the mean 2 standard deviations range. cytosine deamination and G + C content in HCoV-HKU1 was the most extreme codon usage bias. database rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval is always the cornerstone. a comprehensive database of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes offers rapid, efficient and user-friendly batch sequence retrieval and analysis. in coVDB, annotations on all non-structural proteins in the polyprotein encoded by ORFs downstream to ORF1ab were performed. all sequences with identical nucleotide sequences were labeled. deltacoronavirus includes BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12 and MunCoV HKU13. bat coronaviruses dominate the Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera. bird coronaviruses dominate the Gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus genera."}
