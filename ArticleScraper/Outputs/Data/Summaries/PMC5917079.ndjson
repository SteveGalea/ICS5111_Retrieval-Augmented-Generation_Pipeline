{"summary": "the FETP is a 2-year training program in applied epidemiology. the program is modeled after the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. residents are skilled in applied epidemiology and are highly qualified for government-level public health positions. from 2001 to 2004, the FETP was in its second phase as the Jordan Surveillance Project (phase II) the program expanded its scope to include communicable and noncommunicable disease surveillance. the current phase (phase IV) of the FETP is marked by the departure of the CDC-assigned Resident Advisor. the FETP program is now accredited as a training program for the Jordanian Board Certificate in community medicine. a total of 63 people have graduated from the FETP program. of the total graduates, 54 were from Jordan, 2 from Palestinian territories, 2 from Iraq, 3 from Yemen, and 2 from Syria. the J-FETP and the Ministry of Health established 5 sentinel sites in Jordan to detect and respond to foodborne illness. the CDC, Jordan Ministry of Health, and the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) have formed a Jordan MERS-CoV team. the FETP has conducted retrospective serologic and epidemiologic studies of the virus. the data inform the Jordan Ministry of Health of health trends among the Syrian population. it includes potential disease outbreaks, access to Ministry of Health facilities by the refugee population, and the type of care provided. the ministry of health is also able to communicate monthly data reports to international nongovernmental organizations to enable a collaborative humanitarian response. the Non-Communicable Disease Directorate was established in the Ministry of Health in 2005. the directorate is responsible for monitoring noncommunicable disease surveillance and implementing noncommunicable disease reduction programs. the directorate is led by a J-FETP graduate, and residents spend a portion of their training working within the Directorate. the Jordan Infectious Disease Information System (JIDIS) was created. the electronic database was installed at the local and central directorates to track cases of infectious disease. all cases of infectious disease are recorded by ministry of health facility staff in the JIDIS. the J-DDM program has graduated 53 midlevel professionals through 3 cohorts since its establishment in 1998. in recent years, the program has contributed to progressive policy changes with regard to national health. the program has trained Ministry of Health hospital personnel and established a hospital infection control surveillance system at the local levels. the residents led a major investigation of a dengue fever outbreak. they presented a comprehensive report of dengue fever along the Red and Arabian seas. the residents also participated in a long-term plan of starting an FETP in Syria. the etiology and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV has been improved. the etiology and mode of transmission of the virus has been improved. 9 cases of a hospital-associated outbreak in 2012 were positive for MERS-CoV. e population, prevent major population health issues, and identify needs for increased health facility capacity. the ministry of health is also able to communicate monthly data reports to international nongovernmental organizations to enable a collaborative humanitarian response. residents and graduates have been recognized for their applied epidemiology projects in surveillance systems in a number of international conferences. the Jordan Infectious Disease Information System (JIDIS) recognized the need for surveillance and reporting at the local levels. each week, the FETP residents collect, examine, and organize the data from the JIDIS into a presentation for the Directorate of Communicable Diseases at the Ministry of Health. the weekly presentation communicates all cases of infectious disease throughout the country, by governorate. the central national laboratory attends the meetings to enhance coordination between the epidemiologists and laboratory staff. the program has trained Ministry of Health hospital personnel and established a hospital infection control surveillance system at the local levels. a project in balqa, Jordan, led to increased reporting of modifiable disease from the private sector. a report on rubella among government school teachers resulted in revision to the national policy on teachers\u2019 sick leave. EMPHNET, the network that supports the strengthening of FETPs in the eastern Mediterranean region, is headquartered in Amman, Jordan. the health system in Jordan is considered to be one of the strongest in the region. the health system in Jordan is considered to be one of the strongest in the region. political unrest and humanitarian crises add complexity to public health needs in the region. the prolonged existence of these regional issues will further increase the demand for an enhanced public health response, requiring experts with field experience."}
