{"summary": "in most published studies, oligonucleotide microarrays are designed to screen specific sequence tracts, up to megabases in length (11,15,22,23), for all possible single nucleotide substitutions. the same emphasis was not placed on identifying all possible small insertions and deletions in the heterozygous state. however, it is crucial to detect such small insertions and deletions since they can play a major role in inactivating or altering gene nucleic acid hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays used in large-scale mutational analysis of the ATM gene responsible for autosomal recessive disorder. this gene is responsible for autosomal recessive disorder involving cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition. this provides the first comparative analysis of the hybridization properties of substitution, insertion and deletion probes in an oligonucleotide micro samples with wild-type sequences in the region encompassing a given mutation are included in this analysis. several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were present multiple times: 735 C/T, 2572 T/C and 4258 C/T in two samples; 3161 C/G in four samples; and 5557 G/A in five samples. the specificity was calculated as the ratio of the PM probe hybridization signal of the wild-type target to their cognate insertion, deletion or single base substitution probes on each strand. the logarithm of these ratios was plotted as a function of the position within the gene. to illustrate the special patterns, running averages of data from 10 bases were used. aHybridization specificity ratio is defined as the ratio of PM probe hybridization signal to that of the brightest mismatch probe within a given category. a series of 120 DNA samples derived from biopsies of lymphoma patients were previously screened for all possible ATM mutations using oligonucleotide microarrays. fluorescein-labeled reference target was made using genomic DNA from an unaffected individual. reference and test target targets were fragmented, diluted in hybridization buffer and hybridized to the ATM microarrays. data analysis Custom software was used to quantify hybridization signals for each probe and subtract background hybridization signals. to estimate the mean hybridization specificity for each type of mutation, the geometric mean (i.e. the antilog of the average of the logged ratios) over all bases and over all specimens was calculated. the coefficient of variation (cv) was calculated in two ways. oligonucleotide microarrays were designed to screen the sense and antisense strands of the ATM coding region for genetic variation. the ATM sense and antisense microarrays contain 55 008 probes complementary to all possible single base substitutions, 73 344 probes complementary to all possible one base deletions and 18 336 probes complementary to all possible one base deletions. the entire sense ATM microarray is shown on the leftmost side along magnified regions showing base substitution and insertion and deletion probes interrogating nucleotide positions 3247\u20133261 of the ATM gene. the identity of this sequence tract is provided above the base substitution probes. ratio of the PM probe signal to that of the cognate insertion probe with the highest hybridization signal. for both sense and antisense strands, we found that the two base deletion probes had the highest average PM to cognate MM hybridization specificity ratio. a similar distribution of specificity ratios for single base substitution and two base deletion probes on both strands. a 10-base running window of the log10 hybridization specificity ratios of substitution (red), one base deletion (green), two base deletion (blue) and one base insertion (black) was plotted for the sense (A) and antisense (B) strands of ATM exon 50. the hybridization specificity ratios fluctuate across the exon 50 sequence. substitution probes had the lowest average intra-sample cv, 0.31 and 0.23 for sense and antisense strands, respectively. one base deletion, two base deletion and insertion probes showed comparable intra-sample coefficients of variation on the sense strand, 0.37, 0.39, and 0.38. insertion probes showed relatively higher variability than the deletion probes on the antisense strand.

base 815\u2013839 of antisense ATM target; base 3579\u20133608 of sense ATM target; sense ATM target. single base insertion probes show substantially lower reproducibility across experiments than base substitution, one base deletion and two base deletion probes. the increased inter- and intra-sample variability in hybridization specificity of single base insertion and deletion probes relative to single base substitution. the higher average hybridization specificity ratios of two base deletion probes relative to substitution probes are in agreement with the predicted properties of these probes. the higher average hybridization specificity ratios of two base deletion probes relative to substitution probes are in agreement with the predicted properties of these probes. 4N probes per base per strand are needed to screen for insertions of length N in a mixed sequence. it is unlikely that oligonucleotides complementary to insertions of two or more base pairs will be represented on microarrays screening large sequence tracts for mutations in the near future. insertions, and 18 336 probes complementary to all possible two base deletions in the ATM coding sequence. nucleotides 3237\u20133271 of the sense strand of the ATM coding region are depicted as target. all mismatch probes are 25mers and the 13th position of the probe is the interrogation position. global hybridization properties of mutation-specific probes. we determined the average ratio of PM probe hybridization signal of wild-type target to their cognate insertion, deletion and single base substitution probes. for single base substitution probes, we report the ratio of the PM probe signal to that of the cognate substitution probe with the highest hybridization signal. hybridization specificity ratios (y-axis) for substitution (red), one base deletion (green), two base deletion (blue) and one base insertion (black) probes present within distinct bins are provided for sense (A) and antisense (B) microarrays. hybridization specificity ratios are averaged across 68 experiments on each strand. s for the substitution, one base deletion, two base deletion and one base insertion probes consistently showed a higher average hybridization specificity ratio followed by single base substitution, single base deletion and single base insertion probes on both strands of exon 50. however, the hybridization specificity ratios for all classes of mismatch probes fluctuate across the exon 50 sequence. in Table 2, we report nucleotide tracts where at least 8 probes within a given 10 base window showed poor hybridization specificity ratios. a comprehensive listing of probes with poor hybridization specificity is provided in Supplementary Table 1. at least eight of 10 bases provided poor hybridization specificity ratios (1.2-fold) on the indicated strand. cType of mismatch probe that provided poor hybridization specificity ratios. bp duplex can form duplexes that range from 12 to 18 bp in length with wild-type target due to slippage. this type of ambiguity leads to increased stability of these DNA\u2013RNA heteroduplexes. based on Gibbs free energy values, we classified the probes and targets as having strong (S) [G (3 kcal/mmol)], medium (M) [(1 kcal/mmol) > G > (3 kcal/mmol)] and weak (W) [G > (1 kcal/mmol)] potential for secondary structure. the single base substitution probes showed at least 2-fold higher coefficients of variation on both strands. the substitution probes are 3.5-fold higher than any of the other classes of mismatch probes. the error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean of the hybridization specificity ratio determined over a running window of 10 bases in each of the 68 samples. deletion probes contain the bulged nucleotide in duplexes with wild-type target. possible duplexes formed between mismatch probes and wild-type target. duplexes containing a single base bulge are predicted to be more stable than those containing single nucleotide mismatches. it is reasonable to assume that the microarrays themselves are not the major source of variability. it seems more likely that the insertion and deletion probes are more sensitive to subtle changes in target preparation (e.g. amount of fragmentation and dye incorporation) than the substitution probes.
