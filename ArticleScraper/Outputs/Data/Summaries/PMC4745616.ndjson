{"summary": "emergence of novel coronavirus (nCoV) in the Gulf region, and human cases of a subtype of avian influenza (H5N7) in China. in 2007, the international organization for migration undertook a campaign to increase influenza pandemic preparedness in migrants in Asia and Africa. public health education campaigns are a cornerstone of primary prevention. there is scant evidence about specific factors that may be utilized in order to facilitate the intake and retention of the material presented in these campaigns. data from 384 participants available for analyses and assuming 50% (n = 192) will have low knowledge levels, logistic models can reasonably be developed with 18 predictors. participants were sampled from all known migrant-populated communities within these provinces. all MCHWs received training on research methodology, survey administration and research ethics. data collected on socio-demographic factors, migration status, health information sources, barriers to accessing public healthcare services and pandemic preparedness activity/service exposure. questionnaire revised from previous IOM influenza questionnaire. two days of data collection were observed in each province by one author (J.H.) to ensure that data collection occurred as set out in training. each data collectors\u2019 first three interviews were audio-recorded and reviewed to ensure that subsequent administrations of the questionnaire were consistent. logistic regression models were used to eliminate variables with minor contribution to the model. a stepwise procedure was used to eliminate variables with minor contribution to the model. results were similar in the two provinces thus their combined results are presented here. participants were sampled from all known migrant-populated communities within these provinces. data collected on socio-demographic factors, migration status, health information sources and barriers to accessing public healthcare services. 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire revised from previous IOM influenza questionnaire to incorporate key components of the WHO's pandemic preparedness checklist. responses for each \u2018knowledge\u2019 question were assessed and a \u2018correct\u2019 answer for each was determined based on the current literature. the questionnaire was then translated from English into Thai using two independent translation services. questionnaires underwent a second review by a research assistant prior to data entry. if answers were unclear or incomplete, the research assistant immediately contacted the MCHW to address the issue. the first 20 questionnaires entered by each data-entry clerk were re-entered by one author (J.H.) in their entirety. feedback was given to the data-entry clerks and/or MCHWs, the error corrected and the next 20 records examined similarly. if a coefficient(s) changed by >10% the variable was re-entered. this process was continued until no further variables could be removed from the model. the most common barriers included cost of accessing health care services (23%), cost of treatment (22%), fear of arrest/deportation (20%) and language barrier (19%). over one in ten had attended some type of influenza prevention activity (e.g. community outreach) during the past 6 months. at least two groups at high risk for the flu 40 (0.47) 11. Named at least three signs/symptoms of the flu 47 (0.48) 12. Chose four correct ways the flu can spread from human to human 31 (0.37) 14. Had heard of the swine flu or 2009 influenza 78 (0.42) 17. Stated that humans can only catch swine flu from infected person 7 (0.25) 19. Aware that there are humans in Thailand infected with swine flu 40 (0.49) 21 those that could be acted upon without additional external support included receiving health information from a MCHW/volunteerd 3.13 1.79\u20135.47 0.001 \u2018Very worried\u2019 that influenza will spread in community 3.12 2.00\u20134.86 0.001 Returned to home country more than twice 2.49. bInitial set with 22 variables entered; log likelihood 723.7, X2 = 301.61, df 22, p 0.001. cAdjusted for ethnicity, household size, health professional information source, time in Thailand, migration status, gender and barriers to health care. access to public health care One-third had been sick (35%) and most of these migrants had sought health care at a hospital or a clinic in the past 6 months (31%). the most common barriers included cost of accessing service (23%), cost of treatment (22%), fear of arrest/deportation (20%) and language barrier (19%). three signs/symptoms of avian influenza in humans 65 (0.43) Human (seasonal) influenza 8. Had heard of human influenza or the flu 61 (0.49) 9. Named at least two groups at high risk for the flu 40 (0.47) 11. Chose four correct ways the flu can spread from human to human 31 (0.37) 14. Had heard of the seasonal influenza vaccine or flu shot 32 (0.47) 15. Stated that humans can only catch swine flu from infected person 7 (0.25) 19. Aware that there those who participated in any such activity during the past six months also more likely to have a high level of knowledge. those that could be acted upon without additional external support included receiving health information from a MCHW [OR 3.13 (95% CI 1.79\u20135.47)], seeking health care at a hospital/clinic [OR 2.44 (95% CI 1.60\u20133.72)] and receiving health information from television [OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.41\u20133.91)]. influenza knowledge is generally low in displaced persons and labor migrants in Thailand, placing them at risk for propagation of pandemic influenza. the results show that influenza knowledge is generally low in displaced persons and labor migrants in Thailand, placing them at risk for propagation. participants who received health or influenza information from a MCHW during the past 6 months were more likely to have a high level of knowledge. participants who had visited a hospital or clinic during the past 6 months were more likely to have a high level of knowledge than those who had not. high levels of education may improve migrants\u2019 ability to obtain, process and understand health information. higher levels of education may improve migrants\u2019 ability to obtain, process and understand health information. Increasing education options may also have secondary benefits of increasing Thai language ability and income. information campaigns to promote hygienic practices, transmission prevention and adherence to non-medical interventions were, and remain, of great public health importance. educational messages should combine clear information on influenza attributes (e.g. signs and symptoms) with positive actions that individuals can take to protect themselves. participants show some degree of pandemic preparedness, but the majority have knowledge gaps that place them at risk for contracting and spreading influenza. these results can be used to inform public health policy and practice and improve influenza communication and education efforts."}
