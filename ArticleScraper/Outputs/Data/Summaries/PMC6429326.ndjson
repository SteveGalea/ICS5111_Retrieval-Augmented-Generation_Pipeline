{"summary": "global emergence of arboviruses has become possible due to several factors including urbanization, rapid population growth, and climate change. the extent to which humans have reshaped the environment has also led to a dynamic spread of pathogens and their vectors. the dissemination of arboviruses, in particular, is dependent on their vectors. recent incidences of infection have resulted in severe phenotypes. rash, meningoencephalitis, and fetal abnormalities. despite the prevalence of birth defects, diagnosis remains a challenge. phenotypic spectrum of outcomes of pregnancy-associated ZIKV infection has identified ZIKV as a dangerous and atypical member among the flaviviruses. flaviviruses carry out their life cycle by utilizing machinery and functions of the host cell. many of these crucial interactions, however, remain elusive. NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein of the flavivirus genus. it contains an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. methyltransferase (MTase) domain is involved in translation and evasion of host immune response. fusion loop region also found in WNV, YFV, and DENV1-4. pijlman et al. has shown that a reduction in CPE of viruses results from the failure to produce sfRNA1. sfRNA is another potential viral factor used by flaviviruses to promote host cell death following a virus infection. ZIKV infection exhibits broad distribution and persistence in body tissues and fluids, a characteristic that distinguishes ZIKV from other arthropod-transmitted flaviviruses. the presence of ZIKV has been detected in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and in semen. ZIKV exhibits preferential infection of neural progenitor cells, leading to cell-cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and inhibition of NPC differentiation. prenatal infection of ZIKV has adverse pregnancy effects that range from congenital abnormalities to pregnancy loss and miscarriage. sexual transmission poses a concerning threat to people outside of the ZIKV epidemic-prone regions. previous knowledge of flaviviruses as exclusively vector-borne diseases was contested when a case of ZIKV infection resulted in a human-to-human transmission in 2008. increasing reports of sexual transmission of ZIKV have been documented. preferential targets of ZIKV infection exhibited high expression levels of entry receptor genes, such as Axl and heat shock protein genes. the vagina was identified as another site susceptible to ZIKV infection, and sustained a viral replication that was more robust than other organs. the phosphatidylserine receptor Axl on the cell surface mediates virus entry and the viral E proteins facilitate attachment to host cell. the ligand of Axl recognizes the viral particle and functions as a bridge between the virus and host cell. it is interesting to note the dual role of Axl, which normally promotes NSC survival, replication, and neurogenesis. crosstalk between different cell death pathways provides protection for innate immune signaling pathways that are frequently targets of pathogen attacks. apoptosis is the most likely mechanism of cell death in NSCs and NPCs. chemistry of brain tissues in Azevedo et al. showed significantly higher expression of NLRP1, NLRP3, and AIM2, cytokines IL-1, IL-18, IL-33, and caspase 1 in cases of ZIKV-induced microcephaly. monel et al. suggests paraptosis as another form of cell death induced by ZIKV infection. proteins of the type I IFN subgroup exhibited contradictory roles in DENV pathogenesis. certain proteins were upregulated compared to other that were reduced in infected patients. in vitro studies of type III IFNs induction following DENV infection demonstrated that IFN- has the inhibitory potential to control DENV replication. IFITMs have demonstrated the ability to inhibit viral replication of various pathogens including flaviviruses such as WNV and DENV. IFITM3 specifically inhibited the early stages of ZIKV replication, evident from the significant decrease in the expression level of viral RNA. viruses employ multiple immune evasion mechanisms to mount an effective countermeasure to the host cell immune response. nonstructural proteins interact with molecules involved in innate immunity to establish efficient viral replication. NS1, NS4A, and NS4B proteins function as the main suppressors of type I IFN induction. NS4B contains a N-terminal region that blocks IFN response. NS1 and NS4B of ZIKV inhibit production of type I IFN by targeting TBK1. NS2B3 inhibits the downstream signaling of type I IFN, JAK-STAT, by promoting JAK1 degradation. Akt-mTOR pathway has been identified as a target of ZIKV proteins NS4A and NS4B. the suppression of Akt-mTOR signaling pathway leads to an upregulation of autophagy and impaired neurogenesis in the host cell. the increased pathogenicity of the virus has triggered an extensive investigation of candidates for anti-ZIKV drugs and therapies. these inhibitors range in target from viral capsid, nonstructural proteins, including NS5 helicase, and NS2B-NS3 protease, to nucleotide analog inhibitors, in addition to the previously mentioned IFITMs. repurposing, a process during which a library of drugs that have already been FDA-approved is delphinidin and epigallocatechin gallate have exhibited potential antiviral activities against flaviviruses including ZIKV, DENV, and WNV. flavonoid isoquercitrin also demonstrated antiviral effect against ZIKV by acting on viral entry [114] berberine and emodin showed strong inhibitory effect on ZIKV infectivity in vitro [116] further insights into virus\u2013host cell interactions and mechanisms associated with increased virulence of ZIKV will better aid in the design and development of safer and more potent drugs."}
