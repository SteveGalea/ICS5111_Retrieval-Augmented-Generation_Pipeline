{"summary": "the first human case of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus was documented in 1997. more than half of cases were fatal, primarily due to virus transmission from domestic poultry to humans (1). despite severity of disease and high fatality rate, H5N1 cases have remained sporadic. virus in cultured human airway epithelial cells suggests adaptation of H7N9 to its human host (20) pathogenicity is due in part to the cytopathic effects of viral replication and the tissue damage that arises from an overly robust immune response. 1918 H1N1 is thought to have caused severe disease and death in part because it elicited a highly aberrant immune response in the host (21) lung responses to anhui1 and NL219 were overall most similar to each other and intermediate to those elicited by VN1203 and Mex4482. all three avian viruses were pathogenic in mice. increased pathogenicity correlated with increased induction of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism. allantoic fluid from multiple eggs was pooled, clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at 70\u00b0C. mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol in tert-amyl alcohol (Avertin); then inoculated intranasally with 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline (mock infection) animal research was conducted under the guidance of the CDC's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. sections were fixed by submersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. y annotation was retrieved using the R package mgug4122a.db. differential expression was determined by comparing influenza virus-infected replicates to time-matched mock-infected samples based on a linear model fit for each probe. the IPA database was queried with lists of DE genes from days 1 and 3 postinoculation in H7N9-infected mice. we defined immune cell genes as those genes that were expressed 20-fold more in an immune cell type than in lung tissue based on microarray data from GeneAtlas v3. a large number of genes upregulated after infection are highly expressed in granulocytes compared to lungs. allantoic fluid from multiple eggs was pooled, clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at 70\u00b0C. all research with avian viruses was conducted under biosafety level 3 containment. mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol in tert-amyl alcohol. lung sections were fixed by submersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. sections were made at 5 m and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RNA isolation and microarray processing were performed in quadruplicate. differential expression was determined by comparing influenza virus-infected replicates to time-matched mock-infected samples based on a linear model fit for each probe using the R package limma (29) a right-tailed Fisher exact test was used to calculate the probability that enrichment of each biological function was due to chance alone. we selected all the molecules annotated \u201cdrugs and chemicals\u201d with Z scores less than 2. RESULTS H7N9, H7N7, and H5N1 are more pathogenic than pdm09H1N1 despite having similar replication levels. previous reports have described human isolates of H7N9, H7N7, and H5N1 as highly pathogenic. the three avian viruses induced continuous weight loss in the mice. Mex4482 was not pathogenic at a dose of 105 PFU in mice. titers peaking at 106 PFU/ml on day 3. multidimensional scaling aims to represent high-dimensional transcriptional profiles in a two-dimensional space for visualization purposes. the distance between two points on an MDS representation is proportional to their transcriptional difference, with small distances indicating similarity and large distances indicating dissimilarity. the transcriptional responses formed distinct clusters with respect to time postinfection and virus strain. host responses to the three avian viruses were remarkably similar to each other on day 3 postinfection but very different from the response to Mex4482. each virus induced the differential expression of similar numbers of genes at each time point. at day 5, the avian viruses induced differential expression of more than 3,000 genes, more than twice the number observed in mex4482-infected animals. human influenza viruses are associated with human influenza viruses (15, 17) we therefore wanted to assess the similarity of the host responses to Ahnui1 and NL219 to that of a human virus, Mex4482, and to a prototypic pathogenic avian virus, VN1203. on day 1, none of the top five pathways that were perturbed by VN1203 (as indicated by enrichment scores) were perturbed by Mex4482. the top 5 enriched pathways are represented as radial plots at day 1. the distance from the center in each radial plot represents the enrichment score (ES) the induction of cytokine genes for interleukin 6 (IL-6), CXCL10, and CCL4 also divided NL219 and Anhui1 on day 1. NL219 and VN1203 inducing transcription of these genes more highly than Anhui1 and Mex4482 did. one consequence of the cytokine response is recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection or damage. host responses to avian viruses were similar to each other on day 3. coagulation genes and LXR/RXR pathway genes were highly upregulated by Mex4482 but not by the avian viruses. there was also less induction of proinflammatory cytokine genes in mice infected with Mex4482 versus the others. the coagulation system had an ES of 15.5 in VN1203-infected mice. Mex4482-infected mice had the lowest ES for the cytokine-associated pathways associated with immune cell recruitment. hematoxylin and eosin staining on lung tissue sections from infected mice. the pdm09H1N1-infected mice had minimal alveolitis. granulocytes were more common than mononuclear cells. granulocytes were more common than mononuclear cells. a new tab Histopathologic changes in tissues from influenza virus-infected mice. hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue sections with hematoxylin and eosin. increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of coagulation and lipid metabolism genes correlate with increased pathogenicity. despite the similarity of the NL219 and Anhui1 host responses to that of Mex4482 on day 1, infection with the H7 subtype viruses induced weight loss in mice. kine and IFN signaling genes at days 1 and 3 postinfection (A) showed expression levels of selected coagulation and lipid metabolism genes at days 1 and 3 postinfection (B) from mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003), H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), and pdm09H1N1 (A/Mexico/4 hypothesized that molecules that could reverse the common transcriptional response to the pathogenic viruses could be used to treat severe H7N9 influenza. the IPA database was queried with the DE genes from days 1 and 3 postinfection in anhui1-infected mice. thirty-one molecules were predicted to reverse the transcriptional profile associated with anhui1 infection on days 1 and 3 postinfection. pdm09H1N1 is more pathogenic than pdm09H1N1 despite similar replication levels. loss and survival differences were not attributable to differences in viral replication. all four viruses replicated to similar levels in the lungs. titers peaking at 106 PFU/ml on day 3. nonparametric multidimensional scaling was used to show the distance between experimental outcomes. each mRNA sample is represented as a single point colored by viral condition. each mRNA sample is represented as a single point colored by viral condition and with different shapes according to time postinfection. each virus induced the differential expression of similar numbers of genes at day 1. by day 3, there were more than 2,000 DE genes in anhui1-, Mex4482-, and NL219-infected lungs and over 3,000 DE genes in VN1203-infected lungs. at day 5, the avian viruses induced differential expression of more than 3,000 genes. genes encoding thrombin (F2), coagulation factor XII (F12), coagulation factor XI B (F11b), fibrinogen chain alpha (FGA), fibrinogen chain beta (FGB) and fibrinogen chain gamma (FGG) were highly differentially expressed in mice infected with anhui1-, NL219-, and mex4482-infected lungs. genes that were specifically upregulated in immune cells were defined as genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell type than in lungs on day 1 based on microarray analysis from GeneAtlas v3. genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell type than in lungs on day 1. a high enrichment score in a specific immune cell population indicates that a large number of genes upregulated after infection are highly expressed in granulocytes compared to lung cells. infection with VN1203 or NL219 but not Anhui1 or Mex4482 also appeared to trigger granulocyte infiltration. however, the three avian viruses had similar pathogenicities in mice. the lungs of mex4482-infected mice were predicted to have lower levels of macrophages and granulocytes. the host responses to the avian viruses are similar at later times postinfection. the top 5 enriched pathways are represented as radial plots at each time point. we also performed hematoxylin and eosin staining on lung tissue sections from mock-infected mice. at 1, 3, and 5 days postinoculation, lungs from mock-infected mice lacked lesions. at day 1, mice in all four groups had minimal lesions. peribronchiolar edema, and mild to moderate inflammation, with associated alveolitis. the lesions were moderately severe for H5N1- and H7N9-infected mice. macrophages were dominant among inflammatory cells. in contrast, the H1N1-infected mice had minimal lesions of mild peribronchiolar lymphocytic infiltrates. edema on day 1 in a mouse infected with pdm09H1N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). bronchial epithelium with moderate peribronchial granulocytic alveolitis (arrowhead) on day 3 in a mouse infected with H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003). increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of coagulation and lipid metabolism genes pathogenic viruses induce a three-pronged signature of increased expression of cytokine response genes and decreased expression of coagulation and lipid metabolism genes. avian viruses induce a three-pronged signature of increased expression of cytokine response genes and decreased expression of coagulation and lipid metabolism genes. a robust cytokine response correlates with pathogenicity (21, 27, 37\u201339) lethality of 1918 H1N1 and mouse-adapted pdm09H1N1 is associated with lower expression of lipid metabolism and coagulation genes (27). a heatmap was generated using the gene list from Fig. 6B and expression values from the work of Josset et al. the IPA database was queried with the DE genes from days 1 and 3 postinfection in anhui1-infected mice. we identified 31 chemicals that were predicted to reverse transcriptional profiles associated with anhui1 infection on days 1 and 3 postinfection. one of these molecules, minocycline, inhibits H7N9 replication in vitro (20) a sharp increase in H7N9 cases during the 2013-2014 winter season. we need to understand their pathogenicity so as to identify novel interventions. all of the viruses examined replicated to similar levels. but induced different transcriptional responses in mice. differences in host response and pathogenicity cannot be attributed solely to differences in viral replication. anhui1, NL219, and NL219 were equally pathogenic in mice at a dose of 105 PFU. anhui1-induced response was more similar to the response to human H3N2. anhui1 is a low-pathogenicity avian virus (LPAI) that does not cause disease in chickens. the murine response to it resembles the murine response to highly pathogenic NL219. this supports previous experiments showing that the basic sequence motif is not necessary for a virulent phenotype in mammals. our current data extend the protective role of lipid metabolism to avian influenza viruses. increased lipid metabolism may promote survival by increasing the cellular building blocks that are required for repairing damaged lung tissue. increased coagulation factor expression could promote survival by decreasing infection-induced vascular permeability. pathogenic influenza virus infections could increase fibrinolysis, leading to vascular permeability, increased cellular infiltration, and irreparable lung damage. the increased expression of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors during nonpathogenic influenza virus infections may counteract fibrinolysis to decrease inflammation. further study of cross talk of cytokine signaling, coagulation response, and lipid metabolism in influenza pathogenesis will lead to a better understanding of severe influenza."}
