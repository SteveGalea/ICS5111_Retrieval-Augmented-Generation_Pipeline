{"summary": "viral entry has been an attractive target for both vaccine and antiviral drug development. the use of carbohydrate-binding proteins, collectively called \u201clectins\u201d, has been explored as a new therapeutic antiviral strategy. GRFT has been studied extensively for the development of either antiviral therapeutics or preventive microbicides. a lack of preventive measures such as an HIV vaccine has hindered efforts to decrease the number of new HIV cases per year. young women who live in resource-poor and HIV-endemic regions such as sub-saharan africa have been the most vulnerable population to new HIV infections. topical anti-HIV microbicides such as creams, gels, or intravaginal rings could be promising, with on-demand pre-exposure prophylactic options. GRFT shows great promise as a general microbicidal agent that can prevent viral transmission and as a therapeutic against enveloped virus-mediated diseases. from discovery to clinical development, much interest has surrounded GRFT because of its potential to be the first clinically proven, preventive measure against various viral diseases. structure GRFT is a carbohydrate-binding protein made of 121 amino acids. it has a unique amino acid residue at position 31 which does not match any of the 20 standard amino acids. as many as 11 high-mannose oligosaccharides are present on one HIV-1 gp120 protein. three aspartate residues in these carbohydrate-binding sites play a critical role in the interaction of GRFT with high-mannose type oligosaccharides. a GRFT mutant with all three mutations loses almost all of its binding capacity. monomeric form of GRFT (mGRFT) was created by inserting either two or four amino acids at its dimerization interface. mGRFT possesses reduced antiviral activity against HIV-1 in spite of its comparable association with high-mannose oligosaccharides. this suggests that the intact dimeric form of GRFT is required to efficiently disrupt HIV-1 infectivity [20] GRFT inhibited soluble gp120 from binding to CD4 receptor-expressing cells. cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV-1 infection were also blocked by GRFT at similar concentrations. a new peptide called grifonin-1 was designed to harness the power of GRFT. a binding competition between GRFT and gp120 for DC-SIGN was proposed as a potential mode of action for GRFT-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 capture by DC-SIGN [21] GRFT also potently inhibited giant cell formation between persistently HIV-infected T cells and noninfected CD4+ target T cells. this efficient blockage of the binding of DC-SIGN to immobilized gp120 by GRFT was further confirmed [ cell killing 0.043\u20130.63 >783 [5] HIV-1 subtype C primary virus isolates TZM-bl and PBMC TZM-bl and p24 0.4 N/A [25] HIV-1 CCR5-tropic strain ADA and CXCR4-tropic strain HXB2 HeLa-ADA effector cells and HeLa-P5L CCR5-bearing target cells. up-T1 cells, Raji/DC-SIGN cells DC-SIGN-mediated virus capture 1.5 N/A [30] HIV-1(IIIB and HIV NL4.3 CEM, C8166, HuT-78, and Sup-T1 cells HIV-1 transmission to CD4+ T-lymphocytes 0.012 N/A [30] Single transmitted/founder HIV-1 TZM-bl cells Neutralization assay using pseudotyped viruses 0.006\u201310 N/A combination of GRFT and other carbohydrate-binding agents showed synergistic activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against certain CBA-resistant HIV-1 strains. none of the CBAs competed with each other\u2019s glycan-binding sites on gp120 since they have distinct binding patterns on the gp120 envelope. MT-4 cells, PBMC Virus-induced cytopathic effect Microvirin, 2G12 mAb, BanLec, and HHA Synergy [28] 5 anti-HIV-1 mechanism of action by GRFT. GRFT preferentially inhibited gp120 from binding to the 2G12 mAb. this suggests an overlap binding specificity with the 2G12 mAb. glycans on gp120 play an important role in shielding neutralization-sensitive epitopes from antibody recognition. disruption of the mannose molecules on gp120 may also increase antibody-dependent neutralization of HIV-1 particles. a lorimetry binding study, GRFT bound to glucose and N-acetyl glucosamine in a similar fashion to that of mannose. this binding flexibility might have an implication for its broad antiviral spectrum. either two or four amino acids were inserted at the dimerization interface of GRFT. this resulted in a monomeric form of GRFT with greatly reduced antiviral activity against HIV-1. resistance Five studies have characterized viral resistance profiles caused by chronic GRFT treatment. a reduction in the glycosylation levels of a target protein can lead to GRFT resistance. introducing glycosylation sites at 234 and 295 in HIV-1 clade C virus increased GRFT antiviral potency. the introduction of the 234 glycosylation site abolished HIV-1 sensitivity to lectin\u2019s ability to inhibit binding to DC-SIGN and virus transfer by GRFT. however, the addition of the 295 glycosylation site enhanced the inhibition of DC-SIGN-dependent HIV-1 transfer by GRFT [38]. GRFT does not exhibit any toxicity at its active antiviral concentrations. GRFT induced only minimal changes in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by epithelial cells. it also caused no significant cell death, mitogenicity, activation, or cytokine release in mouse PBMCs. GRFT was found to be non-irritating and non-inflammatory in human cervical explants and in an in vivo rabbit vaginal irritation model. in this study, no mitogenic activity was reported in cultured human lymphocytes treated with GRFT. however, following GRFT treatment, reversible spleen. and liver mass was also noted in another study. GRFT was not orally bioavailable even after chronic oral dosing. a single dose of 10 mg/mL intravenously or subcutaneously. ten 40 mg/kg doses for 10 days. Neutralization activity found in fecal extract. recombinant GRFT is stable during the storage of plant biomass as silage, which is suitable for mass production of cost-sensitive products. recombinant GRFT is stable during the storage of plant biomass as silage. crude and pure GRFT had potent anti-HIV activity, and the extracts were not toxic in human cell lines. this suggests that crude GRFT with minimal processing could be administered to reduce costs associated with purification. rice globulin protein enhances gp120 binding in expressed proteins. GRFT was resistant to digestion by eight different proteases including pepsin, papain, leucine aminopeptidase, pronase, chymotrypsin, proteinase K, endoproteinase, and trypsin. PLGA nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 180\u2013200 nm were successfully used in the co-delivery of GRFT and dapivirine in vitro. both drugs showed a biphasic release with an initial burst phase followed by a sustained release phase [60]. lal et al. developed a self-administered, vaginal fast-dissolving insert that delivered safe and effective amounts of GRFT and carrage the first study aimed to evaluate the safety of GRFT in a CG gel used vaginally for a single dose. the second part consisted of a multiple-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled study design. rising dose tolerance was not studied because of the minimal systemic absorbance of GRFT, which was reported in preclinical studies. human papillomavirus (HPV) was inactivated by GRFT via a glycosylation-independent mechanism. GRFT also inhibited particles pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV spike protein from entering host cells. GRFT was readily bioavailable after subcutaneous injection. GRFT was able to block the entry of HSV-2 and HPV into target cells. this GRFT/CG combination was also tested as a freeze-dried, FDI formulation. in vitro experiments showed that the treatment of GRFT before inoculation into BHK- 21 cells inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner [17]. anti-HIV pre-exposure prophylactic could make GRFT the first universal antiviral therapeutic that can specifically target virus carbohydrates. if approved, GRFT will provide a superior way to prevent many transmissible viral infections."}
