{"summary": "IAVs are important pathogens with a wide host range and variable pathogenicity. transmission and adaptation of aquatic bird viruses to domestic birds and mammals facilitate occasional zoonotic transmissions. zoonotic IAVs are not transmitted from human to human. hemagglutinin (HA) protein of IAVs has two essential functions early in the viral life cycle (17, 18) it mediates virus attachment to target cells via binding to sialic acid-containing cell surface molecules. differences in viral cell and tissue tropism, transmissibility, and disease severity in humans. the pH optimum of viral membrane fusion activity affected the sensitivity of the viruses to the IFN-induced antiviral state. to test this hypothesis, we generated 2:6 recombinant influenza viruses that contained HAs of representative IAVs from different host species, as well as HAs with single amino acid substitutions. the recombinant viruses shared six gene segments of laboratory strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934. the HAs of Mem-H1N1 and the two duck IAVs, mal-H1N1 and mal-H2N2, underwent conformational transition and mediated membrane fusion at a lower pH than the HAs of VN-H5N1 and Sh-H7N9. the receptor binding specificities of the HA/NA-donating wild-type viruses were characterized previously (29\u201333) recombinant PR8-based viruses used in this study Viral group and abbreviation Source of HA and NA Receptor binding specificity. a Membrane fusion activity and stabilityb Low-pH conformational transition of HA. group 2g HK-H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) 2-6 > 2-3 (30, 43) 4.9 0.06 (13) NDd 0.33 0.04 (12) 82T K822T mutation in HA2 Same as HK-H3N2e. symbol > indicates stronger binding to the receptor type indicated. cells with human IFN- for 24 h followed by infection and quantification of the numbers of NP-positive cells. the single-cycle replication assay allowed us to study the effects of IFN-induced proteins on HA-dependent early stages of infection. all viruses were inhibited by IFN in a dose-dependent manner in stimulated A549 cells. fusion-affecting amino acid substitutions in the HA affect viral restriction by IFN. a large number of fusion-affecting amino acid substitutions in the HA of the H3N2/1968 pandemic influenza virus were characterized by Skehel and colleagues. mutant HK-H3N2, 17R, 17Y, and 82T viruses were inhibited to similar extents in IFN-pretreated A549 cells. variants 17R and 82T showed a higher pH of conformational transition and were less sensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride during cell entry. sensitivity of IAVs to IFN depends on the viral pH optimum of fusion. sensitivity of IAVs to IFN depends on the viral pH optimum of fusion. sensitivity of IAVs to IFN depends on the viral pH optimum of fusion. titers in MDCK, MDCK-IFITM2, and MDCK-IFITM3 cells were determined with a single-cycle focus formation assay. titers are expressed in log10 FFU per milliliter, and the graphs depict the calculated reduction of the titers in IFITM-expressing cells with respect to control cells. four 2:6 recombinant IAVs, VN-H5N1, Sh-H7N9, HK-H3N2, and its fusion mutant 17R, were chosen for the experiments. AECII cultures were pretreated with IFN- (either 2 or 20 U ml1) for 24 h; control cultures were incubated without IFN. asterisks indicate statistical significance of differences with respect to HK-H3N2. differentiated cultures of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were prepared by cultivation of primary human HTBE cells (Lonza) on membrane supports. HK-H3N2 and its single-point fusion mutant 17R displayed the same relative sensitivity to IFN in all four types of cultures tested. a higher pH optimum of fusion universally reduces the IFN-dependent inhibition of IAV entry into human respiratory and alveolar epithelium. the 2009 pandemic virus and both zoonotic viruses were less sensitive to IFN than were A/Memphis/1996 and A/Hong Kong/1968. the former three viruses were also less sensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride during their cell entry. this is indicative of their higher pH optimum of fusion. data points show mean values and standard deviations from two experiments performed on different days with three replicate cultures each. we then assessed whether the differential sensitivities of the viruses to IFN- will be reproduced with other types of IFN, namely, IFN-, another type I IFN, and IFN-, a type III IFN important for anti-IAV defenses of epithelia (46). the titers of HK-H3N2, Mem-H1N1, mal-H1N1 and Sh-H7N9 in the supernatants of IFN-treated cells were reduced. at 72 h postinfection, 100 U ml1 IFN had no effect on the titer of 17R. at 72 h postinfection, 100 U ml1 IFN had no effect on the titer of 17R. recombinant viruses HK-H3N2, 17R, VN-H5N1, Mem-H1N1, mal-H1N1, and Sh-H7N9 were removed and replaced with IM containing the same concentrations of IFN that were used for stimulation. the data are mean values and standard deviation from two experiments performed on different days with three replicate cultures each. 9 virus isolates from human cases of infection were chosen to represent poultry-adapted IAVs with zoonotic potential. the receptor binding specificities of the HA/NA-donating wild-type viruses were characterized previously (29\u201333) so, a/Memphis/14/1996 preferentially bound to Neu5Ac2-6Gal-terminated receptors and the H5N1 virus preferentially bound to Neu5Ac2-3Gal-terminated receptors. 2:6 recombinant PR8-based viruses used in this study Viral group and abbreviation Source of HA and NA Receptor binding specificity (reference[s])a Membrane fusion activity and stabilityb Low-pH conformational transition of HA (pH50-HA) Loss of infectivity at acidic pH (pH50-inact) Inhibition of infection by NH4Cl (IC50, mM) Mean SD (n a Virus ability to recognize Sia2-6Gal-terminated receptors, Sia2-3Gal-terminated receptors, or both receptor types as described in the references cited. the symbol > indicates stronger binding to the receptor type indicated. the single-cycle replication assay allowed us to study the effects of IFN-induced proteins on HA-dependent early stages of infection. all viruses were inhibited by IFN in a dose-dependent manner in stimulated A549 cells. all viruses were inhibited by IFN in a dose-dependent manner. treated cultures were determined and expressed as percentages of those of the control cultures. a large number of fusion-affecting amino acid substitutions in the HA of the H3N2/1968 pandemic influenza virus were characterized by Skehel and colleagues. compared to the parental HK-H3N2 virus, variants 17R and 82T showed a higher pH of conformational transition. variants 17R and 82T showed a higher pH of conformational transition and were less sensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride during cell entry. variant 17Y showed the opposite phenotype. ral fusion pH affects the restriction of IAVs by IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins. to this end, we studied the IAV infection of MDCK cells engineered to express either IFITM2 or IFITM3. sensitivity of IAVs to IFN depends on the viral pH optimum of fusion. titers in MDCK, MDCK-IFITM2 and MDCK-IFITM3 cells were determined with a single-cycle focus formation assay. the graphs depict the calculated reduction of the titers in IFITM-expressing cells with respect to control cells. four 2:6 recombinant IAVs, VN-H5N1, Sh-H7N9, HK-H3N2 and its fusion mutant 17R were chosen for the experiments. AECII cultures were pretreated with IFN- (either 2 or 20 U ml1) for 24 h; control cultures were incubated without IFN. the cultures were infected with 2 104 FFU of the viruses, fixed at 8 h postinfection, and asterisks indicate statistical significance of differences with respect to HK-H3N2. differentiated cultures of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were prepared by cultivation of primary human HTBE cells (Lonza) on membrane supports at the air-liquid interface (ALI) HK-H3N2 and its single-point fusion mutant 17R displayed the same relative sensitivity to IFN in all four types of cultures tested. a higher pH optimum of fusion universally reduces the IFN-dependent inhibition of IAV entry into human respiratory and alveolar epithelium. all cultures were fixed at 8 h postinfection in this series of experiments. the 2009 pandemic virus and both zoonotic viruses were less sensitive to IFN than were A/Memphis/1996 and A/Hong Kong/1968. the former three viruses were also less sensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride during their cell entry. four viruses tested showed the same relative sensitivity, irrespective of the IFN used. HK-H3N2 was more efficiently inhibited than 17R, VN-H5N1 and Sh-H7N9. sensitivity to IFN during multicycle replication of five out of six viruses tested correlated with viral pH optimum of membrane fusion. sensitivity to IFN during multicycle replication of five out of six viruses tested correlated with viral pH optimum of membrane fusion. sensitivity to IFN during multicycle replication of five out of six viruses tested correlated with viral pH optimum of membrane fusion. 1, Mem-H1N1, mal-H1N1, and Sh-H7N9 were removed and replaced with IM containing the same concentrations of IFN that were used for stimulation. the data are mean values and standard deviation from two experiments performed on different days with three replicate cultures each. IFITM3 represents one of the IFN-stimulated effectors linked to the pathogenic outcome of IAV infection in vivo. in humans, homozygosity for the minor rs12252-C allele correlated with an increased risk of IAV infection and/or severity of influenza disease. IFITM3 is abundant in the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. viruses most affected by IFITM3 enter the cells through these compartments. a high pH optimum of fusion would allow IAV to enter the cell from early rather than late endosomes. this means reduce the susceptibility of the virus to IFITM3. the pH optimum of HA-mediated fusion of avian and mammalian IAVs varies depending on the host species and the history of virus evolution. human viruses typically have the lowest fusion pH optimum (from 5.0 to 5.4), while swine viruses and viruses of gallinaceous poultry display relatively high fusion pH optima (5.6 to 6.0) infections of humans with most avian and swine IAVs are generally rare and cause only mild, if any, illness (2). avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are responsible for the majority of zoonotic IAV infections known to date (856 and 808 cases, respectively) human embryonic kidney 293T cells, human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and human bronchial adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. stably expressed human IFITM2 and IFITM3 were generated by transducing wild-type cells with bicistronic expression plasmids pQCXIP-IFITM2 and pQCXIP-IFITM DMEM and serum-free and hormone- and growth factor-supplemented bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM; Lonza) after 1 week, the medium was removed from the upper compartment and cells were maintained under ALI conditions. fully differentiated 5- to 7-week-old cultures were used for the experiments. the mallard virus was propagated in 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the other viruses were grown in MDCK cells. all experiments with the wild-type H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were conducted. pHW2000 plasmids containing the HA- and NA-encoding genes of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) were prepared. mutants were introduced into the HA plasmid with a site-directed mutagenesis kit. recombinant viruses were generated by eight-plasmid reverse genetics. virus-infected cells were detected in all fixed cultures by immunostaining for viral NP as described previously (30) number of infected cells per well were determined under a microscope for the virus dilutions that produced 30 to 300 infected cells per well. numbers of infected cells per culture were determined and were expressed as percentages of those of cultures infected in the absence of NH4Cl. concentrations of NH4Cl that inhibited infection by 50% were determined by linear interpolation. the cells were washed three times with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS++), inoculated with dilutions of 2:6 recombinant viruses in IM producing about 200 foci of infected cells per culture. infections of A549 cells in experiments with wild-type viruses were limited to 8 h. HTBE cultures were stimulated for 24 h with 20 U ml1 IFN- added to the freshly changed growth medium in the basolateral compartments. apical surfaces of the cultures were washed 10 times with PBS++ and inoculated with 6 105 FFU of the viruses. titers were expressed in PFU per milliliter of viral suspension. the cells were washed two times with PBS++ and inoculated with 2.5 103 PFU of 2:6 recombinant viruses in 0.3 ml of IM. after incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, the inocula were replaced with 0.8 ml of IM containing the same concentrations of IFN that were used for stimulation. FITM3) were generated by transducing wild-type cells with bicistronic expression plasmids pQCXIP-IFITM2 and pQCXIP-IFITM3. the expression of the stably expressed IFITM proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal IFITM2 antiserum. the cells reached confluence and were used in experiments with wild-type influenza viruses. the virus was propagated in 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the HA of the H5N1 virus contained a deletion of the polybasic cleavage site introduced by mutagenesis. the plasmids containing the HA- and NA-encoding genes of A/mallard/New York/6750/1978 (H2N2) were synthesized commercially. rescued viruses were amplified in either MDCK cells (A/Memphis/14/1996-PR8 and A/Vietnam/1203/2004-PR8) or 11-day-old embryonated hen's eggs (all other recombinant viruses), clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. the low-pH-induced conformational transition of HA was described previously (43) it determines changes in the HA sensitivity to protease digestion that accompany the conformational transition. in brief, viruses adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter plate were incubated in either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 0.1 M sodium acetate low-pH buffers for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and then washed with P morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES)-buffered saline at pHs ranging from 5.0 to 7.0, incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, neutralized, and titrated with a single-cycle assay. the titers of low-pH-treated viruses were expressed as percentages of the titers of viruses that were incubated at pH 7. cultures of AECII were stimulated for 24 h by adding 0, 2, or 20 U/ml IFN- to fresh growth medium. cells were then washed twice with the basal medium (Ham's F12) the apical compartments were inoculated with 2 104 FFU of the viruses. cultures were washed 10 times with PBS++ and inoculated with 6 105 FFU of the viruses. one hour postinfection, the virus inoculum was removed and cultures were incubated at the ALI for an additional 7 h. cultures were then fixed, immunostained, and analyzed as described above for AECII cultures. all data are shown as mean values and standard deviations of biological replicates. the statistical significance of the differences between groups was estimated with a two-tailed unpaired Student t test."}
