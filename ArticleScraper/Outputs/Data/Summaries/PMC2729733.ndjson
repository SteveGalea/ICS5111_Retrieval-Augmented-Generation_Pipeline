{"summary": "one health is a concept that proposes that a paradigm shift in approaching diseases of humans and animals is essential to meet the challenges of the 21st century. one health is a concept that proposes that a paradigm shift in approaching diseases of humans and animals is essential to meet the challenges of the 21st century. in the past, this approach has resulted in more rapid, efficacious, synergistic achievements in advancing health. the etiology of cattle fever, Babesia bigemina, was discovered in 1893. they collaborated on zoonotic viruses, their pathogenesis, epidemiology, and ecology. the late 20th, and particularly the early 21st century, have been significantly subject to the risks from emerging deadly zoonotic diseases. one health supporters include the Immuno Valley Consortium in the Netherlands, the Indian Veterinary Public Health Association, Croatian Society for Infectious Diseases, the Institute for Preventive Veterinary Medicine and Food Safety Lazio and Tuscany Regions Italy. the late renowned 20th century veterinary epidemiologist, parasitologist, and global authority on zoonoses coined the term \"One Medicine\" veterinary medical school students usually receive considerably more exposure to parasitology than human medical school students. this is due to the much greater volume of endoparasite infections and infection rates for animals vis-\u00e0-vis humans. there remain significant research requirements for understanding ideal management in human and animal species utilizing One Health principles. clonorchiasis, cryptosporidiosis, diphyllobothriasis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, giardiasis, malaria, shistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, taeniasis, toxocariasis, trichinellosis, and american trypanosomiasis. the vaccine currently requires liquid nitrogen transport and one health has become the \"Rosetta Stone\" for a paradigm shift revolution. it presents a means for the health scientific communities to move towards a more panoramic view. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
