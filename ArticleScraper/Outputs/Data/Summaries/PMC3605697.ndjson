{"summary": "innate immune system contains all necessary mechanisms to recognise virus particles leading to its strong and speedy activation. despite all disadvantages, virus vectors have been used to establish strong antigen-specific immune suppression. retrovirus vectors include adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses and poxviruses. retroviridae family consists of spherical (80\u2013120 nm) viruses containing a diploid, positive-sense ssRNA. the nucleocapsid protein (NC) is enclosed within a protein shell formed by capsid protein (CA) matrix proteins (MA) surround this internal core, and interact with the virion lipid envelope. the virion envelope contains the envelope glycoprotein responsible for virion entry into the target cell. the retrovirus virion binds to its specific cellular receptor through the surface unit of ENV. this interaction will determine the cell and tissue tropism of the particular virus. retrovirus receptors are the murine cationic amino acid transporter and sodium/phosphate symporters for different strains of mouse leukemia virus. the receptor is the T cell lymphocyte marker CD4, and CXCR4/CCR5 as coreceptors. the retrovirus core is released (core release) and reverse transcription takes place. retrovirus vectors only transduce cells during mitosis, while lentiviral vectors can transduce cells independently on their division status. this characteristic makes lentiviral vectors ideal for gene therapy of highly differentiated, postmitotic cells. once the cDNA is integrated into the cell chromosome, it remains there as a provirus. cotransfection of these packaging plasmids will generate retrovirus/lentivirus-like particles with the packaged vector genome. after cellular entry and integration, these vectors are unable to reassemble and produce infectious virions. thus, once integrated, they will express the gene of interest that will be propagated to progeny cells. the advantages of simple retrovirus vectors are the lack of genome-encoded viral proteins and persistent gene expression after vector integration. the main advantages are virion instability [35], relatively low titers [36], the inability to transduce quiescent cells [27, 37], and finally, insertional mutagenesis [38\u201340]. the main advantage for the use of lentivectors is their capacity to transduce quiescent cells [27]. clonal deletion cannot eliminate all autoreactive T cells, or at least T cells specific to antigens that have never been present in the thymus. this fact is manifested in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or diabetes. tolerogenic DCs can be effectively targeted by gene therapy techniques using retrovirus and lentivirus vectors. tolerogenic DCs can either trigger effective immune responses or suppress them. tolerogenic DCs can exert their immunosuppressive activities in a variety of mechanisms. some of them include the upregulation of amino acid-metabolising enzymes such as arginase and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) there are two main problems to overcome for efficient human DC modification. lentivectors are especially suitable to modify DCs and render them tolerogenic. they can introduce genes with immunosuppressive properties while simultaneously coexpressing an antigen of interest. this last property is particularly important to induce tolerogenic DC differentiation and prolonged antigen presentation to T cells. the most utilised strategies for the induction of immunological tolerance using gene modification of DCs are shown. in this scheme, the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines in DCs can induce the differentiation of antigen-specific Tregs, or in some cases, Th2 cells. in the middle, lentivectors can either deliver short hairpin RNAs targeted towards proinflammatory pathways such as NF-B, proinflammatory receptors such as BAFF, or inhibitors of cytokine signal these ERK-activated DCs differentiated antigen-specific Foxp3 Tregs in vitro and in vivo. these Tregs strongly expanded in vivo after a second antigen encounter in inflammatory conditions. other intracellular signalling pathways have also been exploited to induce antigen-specific tolerance. lentivectors can also be used to suppress autoimmune disorders without the direct targeting of the pathogenic antigen. lentivectors preferentially transduce DCs in the inflamed joint without the need of modifying their tropism in vivo. lentivectors can also be used to suppress autoimmune disorders without the direct targeting of the pathogenic antigen. inflamed joints in a model of inflammatory arthritis in mice where these OVA-Treg cells were adoptively transferred allowed the suppression of inflammation and bone destruction. the same strategy was successfully used for the treatment of EAE and in the coecal ligation and puncture (CLP), models for multiple sclerosis and sepsis in humans. miRNAs contain small sequences of 20\u201324 nt, termed siRNAs. these siRNAs inhibit gene expression by inducing mRNA degradation. transgene expression in professional antigen presenting cells was responsible for antigen-specific T cell responses. a significant number of treated children developed leukemia, possibly linked to insertional mutagenesis by transcriptional upregulation of proto-oncogenes. the removal of the proviral LTRs can partially solve this problem (self-inactivating lentivectors [20, 131, 132], since the viral enhancers that they contain strongly up-regulate proto-oncogenes. retrovirus and lentivirus vectors can acquire a large number of different envelope glycoproteins as they bud at the cellular membrane. the most used envelope glycoprotein for lentivector pseudotyping is the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) lentivectors can also be pseudotyped with modified viral glycoproteins. lentivectors can also be pseudotyped with modified viral glycoproteins. retroviral vectors have properties that overcome limitations of simple retroviruses. tolerogenic DCs can be used to achieve immunological tolerance. lentivector transduction of DCs can be applied without previous MHC typing. miRNA tagging could be exploited to prevent transgene expression."}
