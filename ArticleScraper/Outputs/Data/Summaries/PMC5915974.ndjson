{"summary": "countries of the eu (EU) and european economic area (EEA) face the challenge of how best to allocate limited resources for infectious disease prevention and control. evidence to determine priorities is often limited and epidemiological data may be unavailable, of uncertain quality or difficult to communicate to decision makers. many studies have addressed the challenge of estimating disease burden regionally, nationally and globally. methodological framework of the BCoDE 2009\u20132013 study was based on the BCoDE project [19,20]. it uses an incidence-based approach with a disease progression pathway to estimate DALYs, an outcome measure that describes the impact of years lived with disability (YLD) following the onset of a disease and of years of life lost due to premature mortality compared with a standardised life expectancy. disability weights were selected from the set developed by the european disability weight project. no age-weighting and time-discounting was applied. selection criteria included data availability, incidence, outbreak potential and whether the disease is preventable with widely used vaccines. the annual number of cases was estimated by multiplying the age group and sex-specific number of cases notified to ECDC by a multiplication factor adjusting for underestimation. notified cases during five years, 2009 to 2013, were averaged to obtain an annual notified number of incident cases.

Legionnaires\u2019 disease, campylobacteriosis and hepatitis B had a significantly lower burden compared to the four diseases discussed above. Legionnaires\u2019 disease, campylobacteriosis and hepatitis B had a significantly lower burden compared to the four diseases discussed. pertussis and chlamydia have high incidence and low mortality. TB, HIV/AIDS, IPD, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease (IHID) had low incidence and high mortality. per 100,000 newborn population (%) Congenital toxoplasmosis 43.6 (22.7\u201368.6) 35.1 Congenital rubella 42.5 (30.6\u201356.7) 34.6 Perinatal listeriosis 34.4 (26.2\u201343.4) 28.0 Congenital chlamydia infection 0.09 (0.08\u20130.10) 0.08 Congenital gonorrhoea 0.01 0.01 Total 123 (82.2\u2013172) 100 DALYs: disability-adjust DALYs by sex and age Most DALYs, around 60%, were due to infections occurring in males. chlamydia and gonorrhoea had a higher burden in women. the total burden of disease in the population under 15 years of age is lower. the diseases with the highest burden in the under 15 years age group are HBV infection, influenza, IHID, IPD and invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). the diseases with the highest burden in the adult population are TB and influenza. the high share of YLLs (72% of total DALYs, see Table 2) compared with YLDs was due to the limited amount of time lived with a disability. the final ranking of the burden of disease gives a new picture of the impact of infectious diseases when compared with notification data. a DALYs due to congenital infections per 100,000 newborn population (%) Congenital toxoplasmosis 43.6 (22.7\u201368.6) 35.1 Congenital rubella 42.5 (30.6\u201356.7) 34.6 Perinatal listeriosis 2.73 (2.64\u20132.81) 2.22 Congenital chlamydia infection 0.09 (0.08\u20130.10) 0.08 Congenital gonorrhoea 0.01 0.01 Total 123 (82.2\u2013172 DALYs per 100,000 population per year, EU/EEA countries, 2009\u20132013 EU/EEA: European Union/European Economic Area. DALYs by sex and age Most DALYs, around 60%, were due to infections occurring in males. chlamydia and gonorrhoea had a higher burden in women. the total burden of disease in the population under 15 years of age is lower. the diseases with the highest burden in the under 15 years age group are HBV infection, influenza, IHID, IPD and invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). the high share of YLLs (72% of total DALYs, see Table 2) compared with YLDs was due to limited amount of time lived with a disability, which is typical for infectious diseases. the final ranking of the burden of disease gives a new picture of the impact of infectious diseases when compared with notification data. we did not apply time discounting because we did not consider there to be reasons for the decline of healthy life years over time. age-weighting was also not applied because it was considered that a healthy life year should be valued equally, irrespective of the age at which it is lived or lost. IPD ranked influenza as the infectious disease with the highest impact on population health in the EU/EEA. the main driver of the high burden of influenza is the contribution of premature mortality associated with the infection (YLL) the eurostat mortality for TB was 1.07 per 100,000 population in the 28 EU countries in 2011 [41], very much in line with our estimated rate of 1.10 per 100,000 population. our findings reinforce the need for increasing efforts in EU/EEA countries to eliminate TB. most of the burden of IPD is experienced by adults over 55 years of age, although children aged under 5 years also contribute to the total DALYs. the findings are relevant to discussions about vaccination strategies since, according to the report on invasive bacterial diseases in 2012. current study may have been healthcare-associated (e.g. Legionnaires\u2019 disease, diseases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae), leading to some degree of double-counting. other diseases included in the present study may be uncommon causes of HAIs (e.g. infections due to Neisseria meningitidis, TB, hepatitis A and B and invasive meningococcal disease) results of this study were campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and listeriosis. the only difference, the burden of STEC/VTEC, might be due to the higher risk of developing haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) the burden of infectious diseases in the Netherlands is a national study that was based on the BCoDE project methodology with national adaptations. a number of limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study. the burden of disease methodology described in this study provides a clear and comprehensive view on the impact of infectious diseases on population health. the burden of disease methodology described in this study provides a clear and comprehensive view on the impact of infectious diseases on population health. countries were grouped into higher, intermediate and lower surveillance system sensitivity. different multiplication factors were then applied for each sensitivity group. the sensitivity of surveillance systems does not only depend on intrinsic characteristics. selection of diseases was limited to those included in Decision 2119/98/EC. list does not include other infectious diseases with a potentially significant burden in EU/EEA countries. multiplication factors adjusting for underestimation of notified data were selected from information found in the literature. the burden of disease methodology described in this study provides a clear and comprehensive view on the impact of infectious diseases on population health. this study provides useful information for prioritisation and planning in public health, among other purposes. the estimates provide a useful picture of the impact of infectious diseases in EU/EEA countries."}
