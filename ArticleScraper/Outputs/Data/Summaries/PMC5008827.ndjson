{"summary": "inhibitory signaling dampens the immune response, which prevents inflammatory damage to the host. viruses exploit inhibitory receptors for host cell entry and to down-regulate antiviral responses for enhanced viral pathogenesis. both acute and chronic viral infections also induce expression of intermediates of inhibitory signaling for improved odds of survival within the intracellular environment. inhibitory receptors containing one or several immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) are employed to achieve immune homeostasis. dephosphorylation of downstream signaling effector molecules results in down-regulation of immune responses. NK cells are innate lymphocytes that have a role in early control of infection and tumorigenesis. signaling from paired receptors is not always integrated in a simple balance. complexity of signal integration is further underscored by how signaling outcome is tuned by viral manipulation of inhibitory signaling. viruses are known to utilize inhibitory receptors for host cell entry, which also initiate inhibitory signaling to down-regulate antiviral responses. CD300a is an inhibitory receptor that belongs to the CD300 family of transmembrane receptors. it binds cell surface phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which are exposed following increased levels of intracellular calcium during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Binding of LILRB1 to its natural ligand leads to recruitment of SHP-1 and potentiates negative feedback mechanisms. this phenomenon, also known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), is postulated to explain the heightened risk of severe dengue following secondary infection. ILRB1-mediated inhibitory signaling to limit antiviral effector functions and NK cell lysis. HCMV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Epstein Barr virus produce peptides that stabilize the expression of HLA-E and HLA-A. PD-L1 is up-regulated during chronic and acute viral infections. interaction of measles virus (MeV) hemagglutinin (H) with its cellular receptor, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family 1 (SLAMF1), permits viral entry [18]. this could account for clinical observations of immunosuppression and enhanced susceptibility to opportunistic infections during MeV infection. viral manipulation of inhibitory signaling on NK cells constitutes a key thrust of how viruses overcome host immunity. HCMV expresses UL18, a MHC-I homologue which binds LILRB1 with >1,000-fold greater affinity relative to other MHC-I molecules. EBV expresses the viral protein EBNA-3A, which supplies peptides that bind certain HLA-A allotypes. HCMV and HCV also suppress NK cell activation through the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor complex. this mechanism facilitates the interaction between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2A receptor on NK cells. binding to KIR2DL2 inhibits NK cell-mediated cytolysis. binding to NK cells inhibits NK cell-mediated cytolysis. NK cells are widely recognized as innate immune effector cells. inhibitory signaling could down-regulate adaptive immune response. HCMV UL18 binds LILRB1 to inhibit antiviral activity in NK cells and monocytes. inhibiting receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing molecules 3 (TIM-3) are up-regulated on functionally impaired cytotoxic CD8+. PD-1 and PD-L1 are up-regulated in monocytes and macrophages upon HIV-1 infection. PD-L1high infected cells also escaped from cytotoxic T cell killing. reduced levels of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlate to the control of both HCV and HIV-1 replication. understanding how viruses exploit inhibitory signaling could lead to rationally designed interventions that interrupt these critical virus\u2013host interactions. understanding how viruses exploit inhibitory signaling could lead to rationally designed interventions that interrupt these critical virus\u2013host interactions."}
