{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious, enteric disease of swine. it is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and weight loss. PEDV has a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry due to its high mortality rates among suckling piglets. the scFv gene was obtained from the hybridoma cell 6E6 secreting the monoclonal antibody against PEDV S protein. the recombinant scFv protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli using the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag. a complementary overlapping sequence encoding a flexible linker of 12 amino acids was added to the 5\u2032 ends of the VH reverse primers and VL forward primers. a complementary overlapping sequence encoding a flexible linker of 12 amino acids (SSGGGGGGGS) was added to the 5\u2032 ends of the VH reverse primers and VL forward primers. the amplified products of the VL and VH genes were purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) an overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) was performed for generation of the scFv gene of the MAb 6E6. the scFv/6E6 gene was digested using the restriction endonucleases BamH I and Xho I. the ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5 cells. the positive plasmids were selected to determine the sequence of the scFv/6E6 gene. the gel-cutting band containing the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was cut from the stained gel. the gel-cutting band was loaded into the D-TubeTM Dialyzer Mini with MWCO 12\u201314 kDa (Merck) and 2.5 mL of tris-glycine SDS running buffer was added to the loaded tube. electroelution of the loaded tube was run in a horizontal electrophoresis chamber. membrane was incubated with IRDyeTM 700DX-conjugated affinity purified anti-mouse IgG (H&L, goat, 1:8000 dilution in PBS) the results of the Western blot were analyzed using the ODYSSEYTM Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was prepared from the hybridoma cells of the MAb 6E6 against S protein of PEDV using the reagent Trizol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the amplified products of the VL and VH genes were purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) an overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) was performed for generation of the scFv gene of the MAb 6E6 (scFv/6E6) recombinant bacteria were induced using 1.0 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. recombinant bacteria were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) western blot analysis performed to verify the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) plysS cells. the protein was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (NC) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the scFv/6E6 gene was amplified at about 360 and 400 bp by PCR using the cDNA from the hybridoma cells 6E6 as a template. then 750 bp size of the scFv/6E6 gene was generated by SOE-PCR. nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences

scFv/6E6 protein was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1. the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was successfully expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli. it was obtained by gel-cutting purification followed by electroelution and dialysis. the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein fused with GST-tag showed a strong reaction with the monoclonal antibody against GST-tag. the specific reaction band was found to be about 50 kDa in size. scFv is the smallest unit of immunoglobulin molecule functioning in antigen-binding activities. scFv genes from different antibodies were successfully expressed in prokaryotic expression system using Escherichia coli as host cells. many studies have proven that the scFv genes from different antibodies were successfully expressed in prokaryotic expression system. the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein (25 kDa) was properly fused to the GST-tag (26 kDa) of the vector pGEX-6p-1. a simple purification method was used for purification of the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein. authors have no financial conflicts to disclose."}
