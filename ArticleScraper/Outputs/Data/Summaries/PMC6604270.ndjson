{"summary": "Background Historical evidence has verified the multifaceted antiviral efficacy of polyoxometalates (PMs) aqueous VB solution remained stable for 12 weeks without undergoing time-dependent changes. metal elements in aqueous VB solution remained stable for 12 weeks without undergoing time-dependent changes. PMs have different mechanisms of action (inhibiting virus adsorption and entry) and are effective against a wide variety of viruses. VB is a mixture of vanadyl (IV) sulfate (VOSO4), PM2, PM3, oxacillin, and triclosan (Japan registration no. 5953207, Japan patent no. 5279973, 5314218, and 5314219). a portion of these compounds were synthesized according to methods described in a previous study [15]. commercially available forms of VOSO45H2O (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), triclosan (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan) and oxacillin (Biotech Lab, Tokyo, \u00adJapan) were used. FSX Inc. fabricated 3 types of moist hand towels for hand hygiene tests. commercially available ethanol-containing moist hand towels included in the tests. VB Separate PM and VB solutions were prepared with GW, IEW, and Elix. an aliquot of each solution was taken at each set time point. the viable bacteria (or fungal) count was determined at each set time point using the agar culture method. swabs were suspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. 0.1 mL of this bacterial solution was spread onto a standard agar petri dish. for specimens that could not be counted due to saturation of colony numbers, the bacterial solution was diluted 10- or 100-fold. the solutions used included groundwater (GW), ion-exchange water (IEW) and reverse osmosis (Elix) water. some companies that manufacture moist hand towels use GW for cleansing. GW was added as a test material in the present study. VB samples were passed through a 0.45-m-pore filter before the measurements. seven metal ions were measured (Ca, K, Mg, Na, Sb, V, and W) a total of 120 volunteers were included, 66 women and 54 men. the mean age was 47.02 years for women and 34.35 years for men. the population was divided such that each group was similar in age. aliquot of each solution was taken at each set time point. viable bacteria were counted using the 10% potato dextrose agar plate culture method. tests were performed under constant temperature and humidity conditions. the mean age was 47.02 years for women (range 21\u201369 years) and 34.35 years for men (range 19\u201375 years), with an overall mean age of 41.22 years. the population was divided such that each group was similar in age, and tests were performed for each group. in preliminary experiments, it has been confirmed that triclosan has no effect on metallic ions. it has been confirmed that triclosan has no effect on metallic ions. triclosan was not tested, as it contains no metal ions. 3 different kinds of water (GW, IEW, and Elix) were tested for changes over time (2, 4, and 8 weeks from the time the solution was prepared) bacteria and fungi were added to each aged solution. the viable organism count was investigated for changes over time (1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days; Fig. 2a, b, 3a, b) at time points at least 2 h after the addition of microbes, the groups containing VB showed stable antimicrobial effects without the influence of storage time or water quality. the same tests were performed for fungi; however, VB dissolved in GW had no inhibitory effects on fungi. tests were performed in accordance with the standards concerning the hygienic effects of moist hand towels. the viable bacteria count increased nearly 900-fold at approximately 1 month for moist hand towels commonly used in Japan. PM, polyoxometalate; VB, virus block. b Stability of PM compounds in VB aqueous solution. b Stability of PM compounds in VB aqueous solution. GW solution stored for 8 weeks at 50\u00b0C had low but stable levels of Sb. stable concentrations were maintained over 12 weeks based on concentrations at time zero. results show each separate chemical compound did not undergo chemical reaction. similar measurements were performed twice, resulting in both values that were not different. VB, virus block; IEW, ion-exchange water. the 3 types of water with no VB had almost no effect on bacteria count. VB effects against Bacillus cereus increased to 186,600 after 18 h. the control had an initial bacterial count of 73,000, but this count increased to 10 million after 20 h. bacterial counts were lower than at the start time. samples of bacteria on hands were collected before and after use of 4 types of moist hand towels. each type of towel was used by 30 persons. bacteria counts were roughly the same for all 4 groups. the numbers in the figures indicate bacteria count per 0.1 mL. b VB effects against bacteria (changes over time after storing VB solution at room temperature and further modifying the solution and changes over time after the addition of bacteria) similar measurements were performed twice, resulting in both values that were not different. VB dissolved in IEW or Elix had no inhibitory effects on fungi. no antifungal activity of VB dissolved in IEW and stored for 8 weeks at room temperature or 50\u00b0C. the viable bacteria count increased nearly 900-fold at approximately 1 month for moist hand towels commonly used in Japan. VB-supplemented hand towels showed lower bacteria counts at 1 month than on day 1. PM compounds work at the cell surface to block virus adsorption and invasion. they have been shown to be effective against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. no similar effects have been demonstrated for other compounds. the use of high-purity water is important, as is preventing exposure to high temperatures over a long period of time. deionized water or water of even higher quality is desirable, but this will involve a trade-off with expense in practical applications. the use of triclosan should be avoided. the use of a commercially available moist hand towel removed 28% of adhesive bacteria. the ethanol-supplemented towel removed 43%. adhesive bacteria counts were 5.4% of the test start quantity after using a hand towel containing the 3 types of PM. funding sources This research was supported by FSX, Inc., (grant number 160401) this grant was used to purchase reagent consumables."}
