{"summary": "Countless efforts have been made to provide a thorough characterization of the cellular localization of components of the RAS within the brain. the inability of circulating ANG II to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier has led to the prediction that ANG II can be synthesized within the brain to act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion at its CNS receptors. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the next step in the generation of ANG II. this enzyme is also present in the brain (36, 62, 157), with a particular abundance in the choroid plexus and in the capillary endothelial cells (5, 23) and also to a lesser extent in neurons within a few regions that are involved in the neural regulation of blood pressure. a network of neuronal-glial interactions may be required for the synthesis of ANG II within the brain. once ANG II is synthesized within the brain, it activates its AT1R and AT2R in BBB-protected nuclei to influence cardiovascular function and hydromineral balance. ANG II binds to either the AT1R or the AT2R to exert its physiological actions. Fig. 1 depicts dual in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies localizing AT1aR to neurons but not astrocytes and microglia in the paraventricular nucleus. genetic mouse models and advances in in situ hybridization provide evidence that these receptor subtypes are predominantly neuronal and are absent from glia. hybridization and genetic techniques for the localization of ANG II receptors have not yet been extended to models of cardiovascular pathophysiology. it is possible that AT1R and/or AT2R may become expressed on the non-neuronal cell types of the brain. however, it is probable that these technological advancements may be utilized in future studies to definitively ascertain the impact of cardiovascular pathology on the cellular localization of ANG II receptors in the brain. ANG II is generated intracellularly and on demand to act as a peptide neurotransmitter within neural circuits that regulate cardiovascular function (7, 68, 112) however, additional intricacies involved in ANG II synthesis may be inferred by the localization of the components required for its production to multiple cell types within the brain. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the next step in the generation of ANG II. this enzyme is also present in the brain (36, 62, 157), with a particular abundance in the choroid plexus and in the capillary endothelial cells (5, 23) and also to a lesser extent in neurons within a few regions that are involved in the neural regulation of blood pressure. in rodents, AT1Rs (primarily AT1aR) are abundant in regions traditionally known to regulate blood pressure and hydromineral balance, including the PVN and SFO (105), while AT2R are densely expressed in a number limbic and thalamic regions that indirectly regulate cardiovascular function. genetic mouse models and advances in in situ hybridization provide evidence that these receptor subtypes are predominantly neuronal and are absent from glia (33, 42, 67) AT1aR localizes to neurons but not astrocytes and microglia in the paraventricular nucleus. mRNA localizes to neurons but not astrocytes and microglia in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) the Mas is a G protein-coupled receptor that is found in various areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, forebrain, piriform cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamus, and portions of the hypothalamus (25, 60, 125, 212). while previous studies revealed that the Mas was primarily localized to neurons within these regions (60), others have observed Mas localization to glial cells as well (150), ANG II has been proposed to activate AT1R on neurons within cardiovascular control centers that are normally protected by the BBB. it is possible that regions that are highly vascularized, such as the PVN (174, 186), are particularly susceptible to such a mechanism by which circulating ANG II can access CNS receptors. ANG II-contingent feed-forward mechanism has been proposed to activate AT1R. neuronal ANG II/AT1R actions are by and large thought to facilitate neurogenic hypertension. many prescribed ANG II receptor blockers cross the blood-brain barrier and are thought to exert some antihypertensive actions via the blockade of AT1R within the brain. preautonomic neurons express vasopressin (AVP) or oxytocin (187), and their activation results in the release of AVP and oxytocin from the posterior pituitary and into the circulation. preautonomic neurons can also express markers that are specific to the other subregions of the PVN, such as AVP. ANG II actions within the PVN would be excitation of preautonomic PVN neurons and subsequent increase in blood pressure via projections onto neurons of the RVLM. the central RAS has been implicated in the regulation of the magnocellular AVP system, which likely also contributes to ANG II's hypertensive effects (115, 199, 213) the AT1R stimulatory effects of ANG II on AVP secretion are likely mediated by the AT1R (34, 199, 213) but several lines of evidence support the notion that activation of AT2R acts in opposition to these hypertensive and AVP secretion stimulatory effects. this is reflected by an increase of plasma AVP levels (80, 113) and decreased pituitary AVP content (118). there is evidence that the PRR is localized to neurons and that its activation influences cardiovascular homeostasis. neuronal PRR deletion prevents DOCA-salt hypertension in mice. at least under normal, nonhypertensive conditions, AT2Rs within or adjacent to cardiovascular control nuclei, are exclusively neuronal (42), and Mas have similarly been localized, in large part to neurons (60). blocking of either AT2R or Mas specifically in the brain via the delivery of the AT2R antagonist (PD123,319) or the Mas antagonist (A-779) leads to similar antihypertensive responses. AT1R and AT2R are present at different levels of expression within various cardiovascular control centers of the brain. if AT1R is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically, AT1R actions are often augmented. however, antagonistic actions of these receptors within or near cardiovascular control centers are likely opposite, rather than mediated through the same neuron. the impact of PRR activation and the counter-regulatory AT2R and ACE2/ANG 1\u20137/Mas axis on neuronal-glial communications have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (4, 179, 191) the impact of these glial-neuronal interactions on brain function have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (4, 179, 191). individual astrocytes contact and oversee hundreds to thousands of dendrites and synapses within various brain areas. this positioning allows them to regulate neurotransmitter diffusion into the extracellular space. astrocytes regulate the release of glutamate, ATP, and other signaling molecules from nerve terminals. astrocytes release factors that modulate microglial activity and vice versa. astrogliosis is characterized by a phenotypic shift from a \u201cresting state\u201d appearance to an \u201cactivated state\u201d in which they respond to potential threats. chronic recruitment and activation of microglia can be maladaptive by contributing to impaired neuronal function or inducing neuronal death. microglia and astrocytes perpetuate a proinflammatory milieu within the CNS. astrocytes and microglia are localized to cardiovascular control centers of the brain. astrocytes and microglia are both localized to cardiovascular control centers of the brain. this neuroimmune communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons has been suggested to facilitate neurogenic hypertension (30, 39) increases in proinflammatory cytokines within brain nuclei that regulate cardiovascular homeostasis are generally considered to promote sympathetic nervous system activity and increase blood pressure. ANG II derived from astrocytic angiotensinogen has been found to activate AT1R on endothelial cells to maintain BBB function (206) astrocytes and the RAS have independently been acknowledged to impact the magnocellular AVP system to influence blood pressure. astrocytes regulate neuronal function, in part, by influencing neurotransmitter diffusion into the extracellular space. astrocytes do impact preautonomic neurons within the PVN in that they regulate the inhibitory GABA tone onto these neurons. hypertension produced by chronic infusion of ANG II is associated with AT1R-mediated increases in microglial activation and cytokine levels in the PVN. ANG II administration impacts cultured microglia and astrocytes by increasing transforming growth factor- (TGF-) expression, while angiotensin receptor blockers reduce inflammatory responses to ANG II and other stimuli (e.g., LPS) in vivo, AT1R blockade using candesartan leads to reduced inflammatory responses during immune challenges or hypertensive stimuli. however, these in vivo actions may or may not be due to direct actions on gli ANG II receptors are not detected in microglia or astrocytes of normotensive rodents under baseline conditions in situ. some immunohistochemical studies have revealed localization of AT1R, AT2R, and ANG II labeling in microglia or astrocytes of the ischemic brain or in brains collected from rodents. mice that have undergone Cre/Lox-mediated deletion of AT1R from GFAP-containing cells have improved prognosis when subjected to myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. et al. found that this \u201cknockout\u201d mouse did not exhibit the increase in AT1aR mRNA or protein (IHC and Western blot analysis) within the brain stem that wild-type mice exhibit in response to MI-induced heart failure. there are several lines of evidence linking the neuroprotective effects of AT2R activation and of the ACE2-(ANG 1\u20137)-Mas axis to their ability to alter the interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the brain (12, 198) there is also evidence that astrocytic AT2R correlates with BBB breakdown during CNS inflammation (181) individual astrocytes contact and oversee hundreds to thousands of dendrites and synapses within various brain areas. this positioning allows them to regulate neurotransmitter diffusion into the extracellular space. astrocytes regulate the release of glutamate, ATP, and other signaling molecules from nerve terminals. astrocytes release factors that modulate microglial activity. astrogliosis is characterized by a phenotypic shift from a \u201cresting state\u201d appearance to an \u201cactivated state\u201d in which they respond to a potential threat by transforming into cells with enlarged cell bodies and ramified processes. chronic recruitment and activation of microglia can be maladaptive by contributing to impaired neuronal function. microglia and astrocytes perpetuate a proinflammatory milieu within the CNS. proinflammatory and immune involvement in communication between neurons and glia. microglia and astrocytes sense and perpetuate a proinflammatory milieu within the CNS. astrocytes, the levels of proinflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species within these regions have the potential to influence neuronal activity within these regions. this neuroimmune communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons has then been suggested to facilitate neurogenic hypertension (30, 39) increases in proinflammatory cytokines within brain nuclei that regulate cardiovascular homeostasis are generally considered to promote sympathetic nervous system activity. astrocytes and the RAS have independently been acknowledged to influence the magnocellular AVP system to influence blood pressure. astrocytes regulate neuronal function, in part, by influencing neurotransmitter diffusion into the extracellular space. astrocytes influence crosstalk between NMDA and GABAA postsynaptic receptors in magnocellular neurons. astrocytes do impact preautonomic neurons within the PVN in that they regulate the inhibitory GABA tone onto these neurons. hypertension produced by chronic infusion of ANG II is associated with AT1R-mediated increases in microglial activation and cytokine levels in the PVN. in vitro, ANG II administration impacts cultured microglia and astrocytes by increasing transforming growth factor- (TGF-) expression. angiotensin receptor blockers reduce inflammatory responses to ANG II and other stimuli (e.g., LPS) in vivo, AT1R blockade using candesartan leads to reduced inflammatory responses during immune challenges or hypertensive stimuli. however, these in vivo actions may or may not be due to direct there are several studies that would be congruent with either a direct or indirect influence of AT1R activation on microglia or astrocytes. a central administration of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic that reduces microglial activation, also decreases ANG II-induced hypertension. 1R receptor population in cardiovascular function, Isegawa et al. (89) recently determined that mice that have undergone Cre/Lox-mediated deletion of AT1R from GFAP-containing cells have an improved prognosis when subjected to myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. there is no difference in AT1aR within the brain stem that wild-type mice exhibit in response to MI-induced heart failure. astrocyte cultures generated from hypertensive rats (152) have linked the neuroprotective effects of AT2R activation and of the ACE2-(ANG 1\u20137)-Mas axis to their ability to alter the interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the brain (12, 198) there is also evidence that astrocytic AT2R correlates with BBB breakdown during autoimmune encephalomyelitis (181) in normotensive rats, microglia and astrocytes are localized in close proximity to AT1aR-containing neurons within the PVN. this is due to an increase in ANG II synthesis within the CNS. the PRR plays a key role in this and then in the subsequent activation of CNS AT1R. pressure extends beyond its ability to increase ANG II levels locally, within cardiovascular control nuclei. PRR is likely expressed on neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. this action of (pro)renin may involve glial effects on RAS components to assist in the generation of ANG II. hypothetical model for the roles of neurons and glia in the central nervous system's actions of the renin-angiotensin system in normotensive (A) and hypertensive (B) conditions.
