{"summary": "many RNA viruses produce defective RNAs (D RNAs) in the course of infection many viruses produce defective RNAs (D RNAs), which are deleted versions of the viral genome. production of D RNA molecules during replication cycles seems to be a common occurrence in many viruses. three major mechanisms of interference by DI RNAs have been recognized (reviewed in references 2 and 5) these mechanisms are: competition for viral and host resources, which impairs virus replication and attenuates the symptoms; (ii) DI RNA-triggered gene-silencing response; (iii) modulation of the functions of viral factors. some DI RNAs are effective inducers but poor targets of RNA silencing. potato mop-top virus (PMTV) is of particular importance because it causes potato spraing disease, inducing brown arcs and circles in potato tubers. most of the currently grown cultivars are susceptible to PMTV, but the virus accumulates at low, often hardly detectable levels. the impact of D RNA on virus accumulation has not been investigated. the only PMTV D RNA reported derives from RNA-TGB (16) this D RNA is formed from its cognate RNA and contains a large central deletion that encompasses 72% of RNA-TGB but retains the terminal sequences needed for replication. if the D RNA interferes with virus accumulation and/or symptom induction, it is not known. mutated or inserted nucleotide residues in relation to the RNA-TGB wt sequence are shown in small script and in bold. the sequence that is not shown is indicated with greater-than (>) symbols. the sequence that is not shown is indicated with greater-than (>) symbols. 8K-FLAG had a 39-nt FLAG epitope sequence cloned at the 3\u2032 terminus of the 8K ORF. the mutant, NC, has a 134-nt deletion (nt 2536 to 2667) of the 3\u2032-proximal part of the 8K ORF, which does not overlap the TGB3 ORF. to obtain TGB1-mod, a fragment of the TGB1 gene was amplified using primers P1-modif-DI-pos and P1-Xba-neg. the resulting amplification product was digested with MluI and KpnI. the resulting amplification product was digested with XbaI/KpnI and ligated into similarly digested pPMTV-3. PCR product was digested with MluI/KpnI and ligated into digested pPMTV-3. obtained PCR product was reamplified using primers PMTV-Stu-F and PMTV-Spe-rev. anti-CP monoclonal preparations were used to coat microtiter plates for ELISA. anti-CP monoclonal alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used for detection. total RNA was extracted from leaf discs using a Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer's recommendations. five- to seven-week-old plants were infiltrated using a syringe without a needle. turnip crinkle virus (TCV) expressing a green fluorescent protein (TCV-sGFP) and TCV92-sGFP were used in complementation assays. plasmid pPMTV-3 (12) bearing a full-length cDNA of RNA-TGB driven by a T7 promoter was used to generate PMTV mutants. 8K-D, 8K-S, NC, N-stop, No-N-stop, and 8K-FLAG were described previously (12, 17) the 3\u2032-proximal part of the 8K ORF does not overlap the TGB3 ORF. no-NC is a derivative of NC, in which 20 point mutations (13 in addition to 7 of the N-stop) were introduced into the 5\u2032-proximal part of the 8K cistron (nt 2462 to 2526) to block translation. the resulting PCR product was digested with XbaI/KpnI and ligated into similarly digested pPMTV-3. to engineer No-CSLIII, a fragment of RNA-TGB was amplified using the primers PMTV-CSL3-Mlu-F and PMTV-Spe-rev. resulting PCR product was digested with MluI/SacI and ligated into similarly digested pPMTV-3. two fragments of RNA-TGB were amplified using two pairs of primers. the constructs were cloned to the destination vectors pGWB14 and pGWB15 (18) antisense [-32P]UTP-labeled gene-specific RNA probes were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) from XbaI-digested PMTV gene constructs. the blots were wrapped in polyethylene plastic and exposed to an exposure cassette (Molecular Dynamics) for 1 to 48 h. the cassette was then scanned with a Molecular Imager FX and processed with Quantity One software. the complementation assays and PZP-TCV-sGFP coinfiltration assays were performed as described previously (20, 21) both TCV-sGFP and TCV92-sGFP were linearized with XbaI prior to in vitro transcription. the obtained RNA transcripts were rub-inoculated on N. benthamiana leaves preinfiltrated with A. tumefaciens strains carrying 8K, TGB1 helper component-protein we used two PMTV isolates (Danish and Swedish) that differed in sequences of the 8K ORFs in the region thought to be important in D RNA formation (16) the first mutant, 8K-D, was constructed by replacing the 8K ORF and part of the TGB3 ORF (nt 1997 to 2606) of an infectious cDNA clone previously constructed using a Swedish isolate with that of a Danish isolate in order to change the nucleotide sequence of 8K-S was constructed by replacing the 8K ORF and part of TGB3 ORF (nt 1997 to 2606) of 8K-D with that of the cognate sequence of the Swedish isolate. the third mutant, 8K-FLAG, had a FLAG epitope sequence cloned at the 3\u2032 terminus of the 8K ORF. the next set of mutants was designed to disrupt the 8K ORF and prevent 8K gene expression. RNA extracted from upper noninoculated leaves of N. benthamiana plants systemically infected with PMTV and mutants for the 8K ORF were subjected to Northern blot analysis. five identical Northern blots were prepared and hybridized independently with one of five probes (5\u2032 UTR, TGB1, TGB2, 8K, and 3\u2032 UTR) the faster-migrating molecule (presumably D RNA) could be detected by hybridization with 5\u2032-UTR- 8K-D, 8K-S, and 8K-FLAG do not produce detectable D RNA. the 8K probe does not detect No-NC because it completely lacks the 8K ORF. the mutants which failed to generate detectable amounts of D RNA had either deletions in the 3\u2032 end of the 8K ORF or point mutations or an insertion downstream of the 8K ORF stop codon. the RNAfold algorithm was applied to the plus strand of the full-length RNA-TGB. point mutations or insertions downstream of the 8K ORF are predicted to destabilize the extensive stem-loop secondary structure. this suggests formation of this secondary structure might be important during D RNA synthesis on the minus strand of RNA-TGB. nt 480 to nt 501 of the TGB1 ORF without changing the amino acid sequence of the TGB1 protein. mutant was named TGB1-mod. point mutations in the sequence adjacent to the sequence incorporated into D RNA also blocks D RNA production. the free energies refer to the stem-loops in the wt CSLIII and in the TGB1-mod. a deletion and point mutations in NC and no-NC are highlighted in gray. in vitro synthesized SLIITGB1arm and SLII8Karm transcripts were coinoculated with RNA-Rep and RNA-CP transcripts. both inocula gave rise to viruses that were fully competent in cell-to-cell and long-distance movement since PMTV was detected in upper noninoculated leaves. plant extracts were prepared from upper leaves at 14 dpi. average absorbance of a healthy plant extract was equal to 0.15. ELISAs were conducted twice (n = 8) ELISAs of progeny virus accumulation revealed that the absorbance values (A405 nm) of NC and No-NC in systemically infected leaves were similar to the value for the wt virus. on the other hand, the absorbance values of N-stop and No-N-stop were approximately 15 to 20% lower than the value for the wt virus. the data were collected from three independent experiments (n = 18) an upward arrow indicates statistically significant increase in virus accumulation compared to the wt. a downward arrow indicates statistically significant reduction in virus accumulation compared to the wt. mutants CSLIII-restore and SLII-restore were expected to be deficient in DI RNA production. both no-CSLIII and No-SLII mutants were expected to be deficient in DI RNA production. mutations introduced into mutants to restore stem-loops are shown on the left side of the secondary structures. no-N-stop, no-CSLIII, CSLIII-restore, no-SLII, SLII-restore, and RNA-TGB transcripts were coinoculated with RNA-Rep and RNA-CP transcripts. all six inocula gave rise to viruses that were fully competent in cell-to-cell and long-distance movement since PMTV was detected in upper noninoculated leaves. RT-PCR analysis carried out on RNA isolated RT-PCR analysis was done for RNA preparations isolated from infiltrated leaf samples. in the absence of replication, DI RNA was not detected. despite the high levels of RNA-TGB accumulation upon transcription from the strong constitutive 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus. cDNA of N. benthamiana upper leaves to detect accumulation of the DI RNA and the virus genomic RNAs at 21 dpi. the constitutively expressed gene for N. benthamiana elongation factor 1 served as a normalization control. experiments were designed using the RNA-TGB mutant No-NC that lacks the 8K ORF. RT-PCR analysis carried out at late stages of virus infection (21 dpi) on RNA isolated from upper noninoculated leaves of plants inoculated either with No-NC plus DI or No-NC alone revealed that DI RNA did move long distances to upper noninoculated leaves. the presence of the DI RNA, if any, in some upper leaves was either very low or below detection limits even by RT-PCR. plus RNA-CP and TGB1-mod and DI (referred to as TGB1-mod plus DI), and RNA-Rep plus RNA-CP and TGB1-mod and DI-kill-AUG (referred to as TGB1-mod plus DI) inoculum served as a control. comparison between these inocula would allow us to determine whether a coding ORF within the DI RNA is needed for DI interference with virus accumulation. the average absorbance of a healthy plant extract was equal to 0.18. the average absorbance of a healthy plant extract was equal to 0.18. the data were collected from two independent experiments. a similar pattern of TCV-sGFP movement was observed in the presence of the TGB1 construct. both PMTV 8K and PVA HC-Pro were able to complement the movement of RSS-deficient TCV-sGFP. a similar pattern was observed in the presence of the TGB1 construct. preinfiltrated Agrobacterium cultures carrying the 8K construct do not complement the movement of TCV92-sGFP at 3 dpi. the diameter of 40 foci of infection were measured at 3 dpi for each construct indicated below the graph. the 8K protein appears to be a genuine RSS, albeit a weak one, and enhances virus accumulation. previous studies demonstrated that a cysteine-rich protein encoded by the PMTV 8K ORF is not required for long-distance movement of the virus. a cysteine-rich protein called b is a multifunctional protein which is needed for efficient virus accumulation. the first mutant, referred to as 8K-D, was constructed by replacing the 8K ORF and part of the TGB3 ORF (nt 1997 to 2606) of 8K-D with that of the cognate sequence of the Swedish isolate (to introduce a BamHI restriction site) the second mutant, referred to as 8K-FLAG, had a FLAG epitope sequence cloned at the 3\u2032 terminus of the 8K ORF. mutants have seven point mutations to create stop codons in the middle of the 8K ORF immediately after the TGB3 ORF stop codon. N-stop, No-N-stop, NC, and No-NC will knock out the 8K ORF, while in 8K-D, 8K-S, and 8K-FLAG it remains intact. the sequences involved in D RNA production were monitored by Northern blot hybridization using specific probes. the RNA-TGB in the D RNA create a single continuous 186-nt ORF. the overall length of the D RNA is 851 nt. the 8K probe does not detect No-NC because it completely lacks the 8K ORF. the predicted secondary structure of D RNA supports our mutagenesis data. the figure shows two RNAfold-predicted, stem-loops, named SLI (nt 404 to 448) and SLII (TGB1 arm: nt 450 to 479; 8K arm: nt 2593 to 2622) the structure similar to SLII designated SLII was predicted when the RNAfold algorithm was applied to the plus strand of the full-length RNA-T the predicted complementary stem-loop structure, named CSLIII, involved base pairing of the arm derived from the TGB1 gene(nt 480 to 506) with that derived from the 8K gene (nt 2562 to 2592) two of the RNA-TGB mutants defective in D RNA production, namely, NC and No-NC, also had an extensive deletion. numbering refers to nucleotide positions in the plus strand of full-length RNA-TGB. effects of CSLIII mutations on accumulation of D RNA and virus progeny. mutations used to test CSLIII requirements for D RNA production shown on left. 8Karm were derived from RNA-TGB cDNA by mutagenesis. a 27-nt in-frame deletion was engineered into the 8K ORF (nt 451 to 477) to remove the 8K-derived arm of SLII. both inocula gave rise to viruses that were fully competent in cell-to-cell and long-distance movement. the RNAfold-predicted structures in the positive strand of D RNA and their calculated free energies in kcal/mole are shown. Deleted bases in SLIITGB1arm and SLII8Karm are represented by a delta. 8K protein and DI RNA act antagonistically on virus accumulation. 8K protein and DI RNA act antagonistically on virus accumulation. wt virus accumulated to a greater extent than wt virus. the wt virus was compensated for/balanced by the 8K gene knockout. asterisks indicate that the absorbance values were significantly different from the wt. two mutants, No-CSLIII and No-SLII, were derived from no-N-stop cDNA by mutagenesis. six and nine point mutations were engineered into the wobble position or highly degenerate codons of the TGB1 ORF. the next set of mutants was derived from No-CSLIII and No-SLII cDNA by mutagenesis. RT-PCR of cDNA of upper leaves to detect the accumulation of DI RNA and the virus genomic RNAs. the identity of each mutant is indicated above the gels. the constitutively expressed gene for N. benthamiana elongation factor 1 served as a normalization control. RNA-TGB agro-construct was infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. RT-PCR analysis was done for RNA preparations isolated from infiltrated leaf samples. in the absence of replication, DI RNA was not detected. control was performed with an empty plasmid transformed with an empty plasmid. RNA extracted from inoculated and upper leaves of the plants inoculated with wt (RNA-Rep plus RNA-CP plus RNA-TGB; lanes 2 and 3), no-NC (RNA-Rep plus RNA-CP plus No-NC; lanes 4 and 5), or no-NC inoculum supplemented with T7 RNA polymerase-generated transcripts of total RNA was extracted from both inoculated and upper noninoculated leaves. RT-PCR analysis carried out at late stages of virus infection (21 dpi) revealed that DI RNA moved long distances to upper noninoculated leaves. a single continuous 186-nt ORF could encode a 7-kDa chimeric fusion protein (7K) consisting of the TGB1 N terminus and the 8K C terminus, it is possible that the putative 7K may have a role in interference by DI RNA on virus accumulation. we knocked out the putative 7K ORF by introducing two nonsense mutations in the beginning of the ORF. sequence of 16 randomly selected clones obtained by cloning the full-length DI-kill-AUG cDNA generated by RT-PCR did not reveal evidence for reversion to wt. Fig 9. Knockout of the putative coding ORF within DI RNA does not affect its capability to interfere with virus accumulation. PMTV 8K protein and TGB1 were cloned into binary vectors using gateway technology. to this end the ORFs of 8K and TGB1 were transiently expressed by infiltration of Agrobacterium cultures, followed 3 days later by rub inoculation of in vitro generated infectious TCV-sGFP transcripts. preinfiltrated Agrobacterium cultures carrying the 8K construct do not complement the movement of TCV-sGFP at 3 dpi. the diameter of 40 foci of infection was measured at 3 dpi for each construct indicated below the graph. both PMTV 8K and PVA HC-Pro constructs showed statistically significant increases in GFP fluorescence compared to PZP-TCV-sGFP coinfiltration with an empty plasmid control. ns, not significant (P > 0.05) deletions as long as 132 nt could be engineered into the 5\u2032-proximal part of the ORF encoding the TGB1 protein without significant effect on virus replication and cell-to-cell movement. this study has shown that the regions of the TGB1 and 8K ORFs which are deleted from the DI RNA control DI RNA production. the suggested mechanism implies that PMTV DI RNA may arise as a result of a single internal deletion. the results also suggest the existence of higher-order RNA structures identified as SLI and SLII in close proximity of the 8K coding region and within DI RNA that might be required for DI RNA production. this idea is supported by our mutagenesis data and RNAfold secondary structure predictions. formation of SLII in the plus strand of the DI RNA in addition to CSLIII formation of the minus strand promotes intramolecular template switching during plus-strand RNA synthesis. this suggestion is supported by our mutagenesis data (SLIITGB1arm and SLII8Karm mutants) the presence of CSLIII alone was insufficient for efficient DI RNA production and could not fully compensate for the absence of SLII. the data suggest that CSLIII and SLII act in concert during DI RNA biogenesis. the DI RNA possess a short ORF; the region of the TGB1 ORF downstream of the deletion is in-frame with the 3\u2032-proximal part of the 8K ORF. potentially, if expressed, the chimeric protein might act as a dominant negative protein. DI RNA could be detected in the upper leaves by RT-PCR at later stages of virus infection (21 dpi) it was shown previously that DI RNA was encapsidated (16); however, it may be that the DI particles are unable to bind to the necessary virus or host factors. the 8K protein appears to be recalcitrant to purification, i.e., attempts to express and purify it either from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or plants failed. in this study, we demonstrated that the 8K gene is needed for efficient virus accumulation. a low level of a virus accumulation could be attributed to the absence of or weak suppressor activity. PMTV DI RNA is in a separate category from traditional DI RNAs. results support contention that interplay between RSSs and DI RNAs may be a more common occurrence in plant RNA viruses."}
