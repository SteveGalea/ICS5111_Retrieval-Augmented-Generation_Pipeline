{"summary": "DENV is an enveloped virus with an 11-kb positive-sense RNA genome. three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) constitute the virus particle. seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) function in viral RNA replication. NS1 is involved in virus replication, as it has been shown to reside within the viral replicase complex. a major portion of the NS1 protein is localized within the ER lumen. NS3 has a helicase activity that presumably unwinds the RNA template during viral RNA synthesis. CM are likely to be the sites for viral protein translation and processing. morphological characteristics of virus-induced structures have been well addressed for mammalian cell systems. but little is known about these structures within cells of the insect vector. Huh-7 cells were seeded in modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. DMEM and 2% FBS were used to maintain DENV-infected C6/36 cells. qRT-PCR was performed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). infected cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's protocol. total RNA was recovered by chloroform precipitation. the virus titer was expressed as focus-forming units (FFU)/ml. the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 10 min and then permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS. cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) RNA was detected by fluorescence microscopy using an anti-BrdU primary antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) cells seeded on Thermanox coverslips were infected with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of 5 h after virus adsorption. cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. NV-infected cells on sapphire discs or cell pellets harvested at 48 h after virus adsorption were placed into the EM PACT2 membrane carrier. frozen cells were then subjected to rapid freeze-substitution using the EM PACT2 automatic freeze-substitution system (Leica, Bannockburn, IL) the temperature was held at 30\u00b0C for another 8 h before it was raised to 0\u00b0C for further dehydration in ethanol. cells were then infiltrated using a series of HM20 and ethanol mixtures before the final embedding with HM20 at 20\u00b0C for 48 h. grids were posttained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by Sato's lead. digital images were recorded as a single-axis tilt series across a range of 60\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 1\u00b0 increments. antibodies against DENV proteins (C, prM, E, NS1, NS3 and NS5) were provided by James Strauss. an anti-double-stranded RNA monoclonal antibody was obtained from English & Scientific Consulting (Szirak, Hungary) an antibromodeoxyuridine (anti-BrdU) monoclonal antibody and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) RT-PCR was performed using a TaqMan probe amplification system. 10-fold serial dilutions of a known concentration of full-length in vitro-transcribed DENV-2 RNA covering the range of 8.67 103 to 8.67 108 copies/ml were used along with the samples. the data were expressed as RNA copies/total cells and RNA copies/cell. cell monolayers were reacted with each of the primary antibodies specific for C, prM, E, NS1, NS3, NS5 and dsRNA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed 3 times with PBS and reacted with a goat anti-mouse TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody. cells were mounted on glass slides and examined at a magnification of 60 using an inverted fluorescence microscope. cells were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 90 min. dehydrated gradually in a series of ethanol concentrations. then infiltrated in ethanol-Epon 812 mixtures at 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 1:9. cells were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by Sato's lead. cells were washed 3 times with cold acetone and stained with a mixture of 0.5% osmium and 2% uranyl acetate in acetone for 8 h at 90\u00b0C. the temperature was then raised in increments of 5\u00b0C/h to 20\u00b0C, where it was held for 8 h. samples were then moved to room temperature to start the infiltration process with the series of acetone-Epon 812 or acetone-Durcupan infected cells were subjected to FS in a mixture of 80% (wt/wt) epoxy embedding medium in acetone using the same parameters as described above. sections were washed 3 times on a drop of PBS and incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody that was conjugated with 10-nm gold particles at room temperature for 1 h. a single-step kinetic study was employed to measure DENV infection parameters. the infected cells were harvested and lysed for the measurement of intracellular viral RNA by qRT-PCR. the progeny virus particles became detectable only at 12 h. the peak of RNA synthesis would be the most appropriate time point for investigating the functional correlation of DENV-induced structures with RNA replication. the cells at this stage were not all infected, which would have complicated the IEM and ET analyses. the 48-h time point was chosen to observe different stages of the infection. dev-infected cells showed three types of virus-induced structures. the large Vp containing Ve within and the T were observed. the dark, small, electron-dense spheres correspond to the morphology and size of virions. fected cells were processed for high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution in 0.5% osmium in acetone. the resin-embedded sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by Sato's lead citrate before examination under a CM-10 transmission electron microscope. TEM micrographs of DENV-infected cells were shown. at 12 and 16 h p.i. single Vp were found to enclose a few more Ve. Virus particles were detected inside and around Vp starting at 20 h p.i. tubular structures became detectable at 36 h p.i. the Vp and Ve structures were first observed at 8 h p.i. (A) minimal expansion of these structures was observed at 12 p.i. (B) and 16 h p.i. (C) the presence of Vp and Ve structures occupying a significant volume of infected cells. immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on deNV-infected cells. at 48 h p.i., infected cells were fixed and reacted with antibodies specific for the following viral proteins. C, prM, NS1, and NS3 were distributed in the perinuclear region. NS5 was observed predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, prM) the pattern of staining observed for the dsRNA antibody represented the area where newly synthesized viral RNA was localized. cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. fixed cells were then permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. NS1 proteins showed a tendency to accumulate on the Ve membrane. NS3 proteins were more distributed in all areas of Ve. specific labeling of the vesicle structures by the dsRNA antibody was also observed. specific labeling of dsRNA was observed on the Ve. no labeling signal of this viral protein was detected on the sections. infected cells were processed for high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution in 0.5% osmium and 2% uranyl acetate. the set of tilt tomograms obtained from 60\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C with 1\u00b0C increments were collected at 300 kV. close inspection revealed neck-liked structures of Ve located at the edge of the Vp forming the Vp pore. this membrane architecture allows exposure of the environment within the Ve to the cytoplasmic space. the 3D model of a single Ve revealed the orientation of the replication complex pointing straight forward toward the pore. the 3D model shows close association between two independent Vp membranes (yellow) that contain Ve (orange) and a virus particle (red) the RC structure (blue) is oriented in the direction of the Ve pore. it is unclear whether these structures are surrounded with one ER membrane and connected to other virally modified structures. different Z slices of a reconstructed tomogram of deNV-infected C6/36 cells show two nascent virus particles at different stages of budding. the particle on the lower left has completed budding from the ER membrane, whereas the particle on the right has a narrow neck connecting the viral and ER membranes. the progeny virus particles became detectable only at 12 h. the cell-associated virus detected during the exponential period, however, increased simultaneously with the RNA levels and peaked at the same time point. a similar result was observed for the infectious extracellular virus during the exponential period. delineate structures were induced by DENV infection. compared with mock-infected cells, DENV-infected cells showed a complex set of virus-induced subcellular structures. a proportion of Ve contained irregular thread-like electron-dense material previously identified in other flaviviruses and single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. fixed cells were stained with 2% osmium followed by 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 90 min. cells were then dehydrated gradually with a series of ethanol-resin mixtures. the cells were processed for high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution in 0.5% osmium in acetone. a time course study was performed to visualize how DENV-induced membrane rearrangements progress during infection. at various time points after DENV-2 infection at an MOI of 5, C6/36 cells were chemically fixed. at 0 and 4 h p.i., there was no distinct difference in the intracellular membrane architecture between mock-infected and DENV-infected cells. electron micrographs representing chemically fixed DENV-infected cells at 8 h (A), 12 h (B), 16 h (C), 24 h (D), 36 h (E) and 48 h (F) after infection are shown. a minimum of 50 cells was examined for morphological changes that occur during DENV infection of C6/36 cells. the log vesicle number was converted to a log and subjected to linear regression analysis with total intracellular RNA copies per cell. the r2 and P values were 0.98 and 0.0002, respectively, and indicated the correlative multiplication of Ve formation to the viral RNA that was being produced per cell during the period of 8 to 24 h postinfection. newly synthesized RNA was labeled with BrUTP in the presence of actinomycin D. the dsRNA antibody showed a speckled pattern at the perinuclear region and cytoplasm of infected cells. the pattern of staining was also observed for the dsRNA antibody. cells were incubated with a anti-BrdU antibody followed by a goat anti-mouse TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody to detect newly synthesized viral RNA (red, left panels). cells were stained with DAPI (blue, middle panels) Immunoelectron microscopy reveals deNV replication sites. anti-NS1 (A) and anti-NS3 (B) antibodies showed labeling in the cytoplasm of infected cells. anti-NS5 labeling was observed mostly in the nuclei of infected cells. only a few gold particles was associated with the Ve. reconstructed tomograms of deNV-infected cells at 48 h p.i. were collected at 300 kV. the tomograms were processed for reconstruction using the IMOD software package. a side view of the 3D model shows the pores in the Vp membrane. the Ve are approximately 80 to 120 nm in diameter, are composed of single- or double-layer membranes. the most remarkable result was the observation of the RC structures within the Ve (Fig. 7; see Movie S1 in the supplemental material) electron tomography of deNV-infected C6/36 cells shows Vp pores. the images suggest that the neck of the Ve gives rise to the Vp pores. the image suggests that the neck of the Ve gives rise to the Vp pores. the data suggest that once the viral RNA-capsid protein complex is formed within the cytoplasm, it is encapsidated by the Vp membrane containing E and prM proteins. the membrane curves to form the neck of the budding vesicle and then forms the neck (Fig. 10D right particle, and C and B, left particle) the connection between viral membrane and Vp membrane implies that the virus particle is budding into the Vp. the purpose of CM structures during viral replication has yet to be identified. formation of Vp, Ve, and T without CM suggests that DENV accomplishes RNA replication using species-specific modification of host membranes. in C6/36 cells, the cellular homeostasis of phospholipid species is perturbed during DENV replication (42). metabolites may contribute differently to virus-induced membrane reorganization. the tubular structure is another feature induced by DENV within mosquito cells. TEM analysis showed a low number of T during 48 h of infection (23, 24) Vp and Ve were first formed at 8 h after infection, when the rate of newly synthesized viral RNA started to increase. however, this correlation did not apply after 24 h, where saturation of Ve formation was observed and RNA synthesis leveled off. we suspect that the observed reduction in the rate of viral RNA synthesis is due to the increased rate of genome packaging and virus release at the later time points. resolution of prominent RC structures within the Ve provides evidence for the hypothesis that Ve are sites for viral RNA replication. it has been shown for flaviviruses and other positive-stranded RNA viruses that dsRNA accumulate within these structures. NS1 and parts of NS4A/4B are localized to the luminal side of the ER. NS2A, NS3 and NS5 are located on the cytoplasmic side of the ER. the transmembrane proteins E and prM are located in the ER lumen. finding in our study is evidence of virus budding, which has not been observed in other studies on DENV. we also observed coreless subviral particles within the Vp. the clear double-membrane features present within the Vp or ER lumen most likely represent subviral particles."}
