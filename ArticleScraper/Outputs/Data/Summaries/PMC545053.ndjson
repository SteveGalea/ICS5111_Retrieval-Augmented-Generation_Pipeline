{"summary": "Lactic acid Bacteria (LAB) are anaerobic Gram positive bacteria with a GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status. they can be used for the delivery of proteins of interest in foodstuff or in the digestive tract. a last advantage compared to other well-known protein producers is that L. lactis does not produce LPS or any proteases as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis do. plasmic [45] lactamase lacL, lacM Leuconostoc mesenteroides cytoplasmic [46] -amylase amyL Bacillus licheniformis secreted [47] [18] -amylase amyL Bacillus licheniformis secreted [48] Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase cat-86 Bacillus pumilus cytoplasmic [49] M interleukins IL-2 IL-2 Mouse secreted [60] IL-6 IL-6 Mouse secreted [61] IL-10 IL-10 Mouse secreted [21] IL-12 IL-12 Mouse secreted [22] IFN- IFN- Ovine secreted [5] Epitope Blg41\u201360 Bovine secreted Virulence factors Fibronectin binding protein A fnbpA Staphylococcus aureus anchored [ ichia coli secreted [69] lysozyme hel Hen egg white cytoplasmic [72] Neutral protease npr Bacillus subtilis secreted [73] Aminopeptidase N pepN Lactobacillus helveticus secreted [74] Cell Surface Protease prtB Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus anchored [13] secreted proteins are synthesized as a precursor containing an N-terminal extension called the signal peptide (SP) and the mature moiety of the protein. secretion allows the precursor to escape proteolysis. secretion allows the precursor to escape proteolysis. new perspectives are now opened in the studies of heterologous protein production in L. lactis. there is a need for food grade systems and for a better understanding of the host factors influencing heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis. pCYT:Nuc was the first heterologous protein where highest protein yields were obtained with the secreted form. similar results were obtained with constitutive nuc expression cassettes for cytoplasmic and secreted forms. protein Quantification of the secreted form1 Quantification of the cytoplasmic form1 Ratio sec/cyto References Nuc 20 mg/L 3 mg/L 6 [5] L7/L12 3 mg/L 0.5 mg/L 6 [19] E7 (stat)* nd nd 2 to 3 [20] E7 (stat)* nd nd > 10 [20] IFN- 309 mg/L 159 mg/L 2 [5] 1: protein samples were production of E7 was higher for the secreted form than for the cytoplasmic form. this difference was even higher when induction occurred in late-exponential phase. production of ovine interferon omega (IFN-) further illustrates this observation. the activity of IFN- found in the supernatant and cell fractions of NZ(pSEC:IFN) strain was about two-fold higher than that observed for the cytoplasmic form (Table 2). Similarly to what was observed for the cytoplasmic form, secretion leads to higher heterologous protein yields. the newly described SPs were less efficient to direct secretion of nuc. a lactobacillus brevis SP (originated from a S-layer protein) drove the secretion of the E. coli FedF adhesin more efficiently. mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the positive effect of LEISSTCDA on protein secretion was due to the insertion of negatively charged residues in the N-terminus of the mature moiety [25]. mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the positive effect of LEISSTCDA on protein secretion was due to the insertion of negatively charged residues in the N-terminus of the mature moiety. the first example is the production of the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of the bovine rotavirus, the major etiologic agent of severe diarrhea in young cattle. in order to develop live vaccines against this virus, the NSP4 antigen was successfully produced in L. lactis [29] a fusion between the LEISS propeptide and BLG could not enhance the SE of BLG above 5%, as determined by ELISA. fusion to a SP stabilizes heterologous protein production even though they are not efficiently secreted. a higher affinity of intracellular housekeeping proteases for these particular sequences cannot be hypothesized. protein conformation is a major problem for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis. a fusion to nuc (pSEC:Nuc:L7/L12) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in production yield. a fusion to nuc (pSEC:LEISS:Nuc:L7/L12) restored an efficient secretion yield. nuc is a stable carrier protein and has a protective effect on heterologous chimerical proteins by reducing its sensitivity to intracellular proteolysis. fusion to nuc rescue E7 in intracellular production and increase protein yields for the secreted forms of E7 and L7. the mature nuc fragment was inserted between SPUsp45 and the fragment encoding E7 (pSEC:Nuc:E7) or L7/L12 (pSEC:Nuc:L7/L12) secretion of the fusion proteins was analyzed by Western blot using either anti-E7 or anti-L7/L12 antibodies. positions of precursor (prec) or mature forms of E7, Nuc-E7, L7/L12, Nu analysis by western blot shows that a strain of L. lactis deficient in the intracellular protease ClpP cannot rescue cytoplasmic E7 production. induced cultures samples of wt L. lactis or L. lactis clpP mutant strain containing pCYT-E7 (clpP/pCYT-E7) or pSEC-E7 (clpP/pSEC-E7) taken at exponential- a plasmidless strain does not present any protease activity in the medium. a plasmidless strain does not present any protease activity in the medium. a plasmidless strain does not present any protease activity in the medium. L. lactis complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the Sec machinery comprises fewer components than the well-characterized B. subtilis Sec machinery. similar approaches allowed the identification and characterization of genes of unknown functions specifically involved in production yields of the secreted proteins in L. lactis. these works will contribute to the development and the improvement of new food-grade systems for L. lactis [43] and should lead, in a near future, to the construction of lactococcal strains dedicated to high-level production of proteins of interest. the GRAS status of L. lactis and LAB in general is a clear advantage for their use in production and secretion of therapeutic or vaccinal proteins."}
