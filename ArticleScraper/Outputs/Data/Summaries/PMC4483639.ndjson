{"summary": "viral envelope glycoprotein HA (hemagglutinin) functions to bind to cellular receptors and mediate fusion with endosomal membranes. high levels of HM glycans are present on viral surface glycoproteins of both HCV and SARS-CoV. HM glycans on viral surface are attractive targets for carbohydrate-based antiviral reagents. some of these lectins have been reported to exhibit strong anti-HIV activity by inhibiting the initial step of virus entry into the host cells with EC50s of low nanomolar range. ray structure of the ligand-bound form of anti-HIV lectin BOA has revealed that hydrogen bonds are associated with the core trisaccharide comprising Man(1\u20133)Man(1\u20136)Man. gal GRFT, which binds to even monosaccharides, displays broad spectrum HIV-1 inhibitory activity without altering gene expression and cytokine production. red algal lectin ESA-2 has not been studied for its inhibitory effect of influenza virus infection. results and Discussion 2.1. certain HM glycans present on the region of virus surfaces would be a specific target of ESA-2. site specific occurrence of HM glycans on HA1 subunit has been reported. another bacterial lectin in this family, PFL from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, has been shown to exhibit less anti-influenza activity compared with ESA-2. d-GlcNAc-binding lectins exhibited very weak antiviral activity. avian influenza viruses preferentially recognize 2.6 linked sialic acid moiety. 2.6 linked sialic acid-binding lectin SNA from Sambucus nigra failed to protect cells. some influenza viruses bound to fucose-branched SA2.3Gal glycan receptors much stronger than linear SA2.3Gal glycans [26] may account for the antiviral activity of fucose-binding lectins. -2 showed a broad spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity with EC50s of pico\u2014to low nano-molar range (Table 1). Cytotoxicity of ESA-2 was not observed up to 1000 nM, the highest dose in this experiment. in contrast, antiviral activity of fucose-binding AOL varied significantly depending on the virus strains. 3.7 0.4 Philippines/2/82 (H3N2) 17.2 3.9 1.1 2.5 Influenza B Ibaraki/2/85 20.4 3.3 a PR8/34 was insensitive to ESA-2 and AOL up to 75 nM and 285.7 nM, the highest doses in this experiment. cellular distribution of viral antigen either in the presence or absence of ESA-2 was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. the cells were fixed and the viral antigens were visualized with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mouse monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. nuclei within the cells were stained with DAPI (200 magnification); (B) Effect of ESA-2 addition after post-infection. in vitro infection assays were performed in the presence of mucins or human saliva. in this test, H292 cells were infected with A/Udorn/72 for 24 h. the cell viability was determined. infected with 200 nM ESA-2 in the DMEM containing 10 g/mL of mucin type I (bovine submaxillary gland), mucin type III (porcine stomach) cell viability was evaluated by amide black staining followed by quantitation by image processing. the data was shown as percentage of cell viability (mock infection; 100%, virus infection; 0%) ins tested, high mannose (HM)-binding red algal lectin showed the highest potency to inhibit influenza virus infection, showing an EC50 of 12.4 nM. this lectin recognizes branched structure of HM N-glycans including trisaccharide comprising Man(1\u20133)Man(1\u20136)Man in the D2 arm as a primary target. it is therefore likely that certain HM glycans present on the region of virus surfaces d-GlcNAc-binding lectins exhibited very weak antiviral activity. avian influenza viruses preferentially recognize 2.6 linked sialic acid moiety (SA 2.6Gal) on epithelial cells in the human trachea. 2.6 linked sialic acid-binding lectin SNA failed to protect cells from virus infection. HM-binding legume lectin ConA showed a moderate antiviral activity with EC50 of 41.3 nM. lectins such as AOL from Aspergillus oryzae and AAL from Aleuria aurantia were also inhibitory with EC50s of 41.3 nM. the inhibitory activity of fucose-binding lectins was much weaker compared with ESA-2. ESA-2 showed a broad spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity with EC50s of pico\u2014to low nano-molar range. besides A/PR8/34, A/Udorn/72 and B/Ibaraki/2/85 were insensitive to AOL. 95 (H1N1) 1.7 0.4 19.2 10.5 Oita/OU1 P3-3/09 (H1N1) 12.4 0.4 123.1 25.4 WSN/33 (H1N1) 34.6 2.7 1.5 3.2 Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) 5.2 1.5 200.8 25.7 Udorn/72 (H3N2) 3.7 0.4 Philippines/2/82 (H3N2) 17.2 3.9 1.1 2.5 Influenza B Ibaraki/2/85 2 MDCK cells grown on cover slips were infected with A/Udorn/72(H3N2) in the presence of 200 nM ESA-2 or 1 mM amantadine. after 24 h post infection, the cells were fixed and the viral antigens in the cells were visualized with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mouse monoclonal antibody. HM-glycans, CV-N and other HM-binding lectins inhibited HCV infection through a different and complex mode of action. in this respect, interaction of ESA-2 with cellular proteins, which potentially leads to various cellular responses such as proliferation or inflammation, should be taken into account. ESA-2 coated plate was pre-incubated with various concentrations of YM for 1 h at room temperature before adding vaccine preparation containing HA mixture. cell viability was evaluated by amide black staining followed by quantitation by image processing. influenza virus vaccine for a mixture of A/California/7/09 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/09 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/08 was purchased from Denka-Seiken (Tokyo, Japan). influenza virus vaccine for a mixture of A/Oita/OU1 P3-3/09 was also examined. anti-influenza activities of lectins were determined by the neutral red (NR) dye uptake assay as described previously [14]. NR dye uptake assay was performed using nine influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain. H292 cells were infected with 200 nM ESA-2 in DMEM containing 10 g/mL trypsin. cell viability was evaluated by amide black staining as described above. ESA-2 Binding Studies with Viral Hemagglutinin (HA) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to examine direct interaction of ESA-2 and HA of influenza virus. wells were blocked with 3% skim milk and incubated with influenza vaccine preparation (Astellas, Tokyo, Japan), which contained HAs from three different influenza subtypes. influenza virus vaccine for a mixture of A/California/7/09 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/09 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/08 was purchased from Denka-Seiken (Tokyo, Japan) all viruses have been propagated in embryonated eggs. flu activity of lectins were determined by the neutral red (NR) dye uptake assay as described previously [14]. NR dye uptake assay was performed using nine influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain. cin type I (bovine submaxillary gland), 10 g/mL of mucin type III (porcine stomach) or human saliva (10 dilution) immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize the virus antigens in the host cells. the wells were incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HyTest) followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) to detect the interaction, a TMB substrate for HRP, 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) was added to each"}
