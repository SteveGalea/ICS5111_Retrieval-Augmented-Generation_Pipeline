{"summary": "an outbreak of acute febrile illness occurred in the Republic of Korea boot camp from may to July 2011. a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to identify possible causative factors. the main symptoms were sore throat (76.0%), sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%), and rhinorrhea (55.9%). acute febrile respiratory illness occurred collectively in a group of patients in a boot camp of the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) from may 2011 to July 2011. acute febrile respiratory illness occurred collectively in a group of patients in a boot camp. twenty-two patients were admitted to the hospital with cardinal symptoms of respiratory tract infection. thoat swab was carried out by smearing the posterior aspect of the pharynx with a sterile cotton swab while the tongue was pressed down with a tongue depressor. Statistical Analysis Subjects classified into four groups depending on the type of hospital treatment they received. the Kruskal-Wallis test and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to find differences in body temperature and duration of fever among the groups. the throat swab samples collected from 5 patients were sent to the Seoul Clinical Laboratories and Seoul Medical Science Institute for analysis. a retrospective investigation for all 588 patients was conducted using computerrecorded patient charts. the clinical characteristics of the disease and types of therapeutic regimens were obtained from these records. acute febrile illness occurred collectively among military recruits starting from may 26, 2011. a rapid antigen test, an immunofluorescence assay, and a multiplex RT-PCR assay were carried out for all 11 patients with early onset of fever. the incidence of acute febrile disease continued for approximately two months, but it ceased after July 27, 2011. the peak occurrence was observed on June 16, 2011, when as many as 30 new patients were admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of fever. RT-PCR, reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. 280 patients (68.6%) had a fever of 38.5\u00b0C or higher. their main symptoms were consistent with those of URI. the study was conducted to find any difference in the duration of fever depending on the type of treatment method. the group that received only supportive care included 14 patients and had a mean fever duration of 1.57 (SD], 1.45) days. patients who received antibiotic therapy had a mean fever duration of 3.85 (SD, 1.93) days. there was no difference in body temperature among patients receiving various treatment modalities. but a significant difference was found in fever duration among the patients. patients with acute febrile disease improved after about two days of hospital treatment. incidence of acute febrile disease continued for approximately two months, but it ceased after July 27, 2011, which marked the end of the epidemic. as many as 30 new patients were admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of fever. the peak occurrence was observed on June 16, 2011, when as many as 30 new patients were admitted to the hospital. the number of recruits in this camp is almost the same each year. rays showed that 4 patients had pneumonia, but supportive care proved effective within a week and they were discharged from the hospital. the group that received only supportive care included 14 patients and had a mean fever duration of 1.57. six patients who received antiviral treatment had the longest mean fever duration of 4.00 (SD, 1.55) days. 448 patients who received antibiotic therapy had a mean fever duration of 2.11 (SD, 1.21) days. sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%) and rhinorrhea (55.9%) recurrence rate within a month is about 10%. patients with severe symptoms and long-term hospitalization may receive an additional antibiotic or antiviral agent. this would provide the basis for a suggestion that favorable prognosis in RSV infections might be attained by supportive care in a healthy young adult group. the introduction of an infrared thermal camera system may be necessary to promptly identify patients with a fever in the military boot camp. of the 588 cases, only 408 patients with sufficient chart records were analyzed. this may have led to the exclusion of mild cases and a depiction of the outbreak as more severe than it was. military movement should only be considered when patients are completely recovered and without infectivity. military planners must focus on how best to control the spread of infectious respiratory diseases in highly mobile military populations."}
