{"summary": "NSLIJHS laboratories routinely encounter a seasonal increase in respiratory virus testing, peaking in mid-to-late February and waning by May. the historic maximum test volume occurred in February 2008, when CVL tested 6,021 samples and clinical laboratories system-wide performed 2,901 rapid influenza tests, for a combined daily average of 308 tests. the RVP assay can subtype influenza A as seasonal human H1 or H3 virus. the research-use-only version of the RVP assay has been cleared by the fda. on April 27, despite full staffing, considerable overtime was required to perform testing. the major issues were staffing, testing algorithms, laboratory space, laboratory information systems and biostatistical reporting, leadership roles, and client service functions. a key consequence of the plan was immediate deployment of an enhanced and diversified work force. 141 samples with nonsubtypeable influenza A, 78 samples with seasonal virus subtype H3 and 2 samples with seasonal virus subtype H1 were screened on April 24\u201325. the NSLIJHS Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory had identified 169 confirmed or probable pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases. cases identified by infection-control or civic authorities were within 48\u201372 hours for lower priority cases. the sensitivity of the RVP assay for detecting all influenza A types was far superior to that for other test methods (8). 320 were negative and 677 were positive for any identifiable respiratory virus. the decision was made to immediately expand the CVL into contiguous space. the severity and duration of the outbreak were unknown. failure to be proactive in expanding the surge capacity of the laboratory was unacceptable. the NSLIJHS Krasnoff Quality Management Institute provided daily biostatistical reports to system leadership. data assembly was automated by building an Oracle database with interfaces to the Laboratory Information System. a critical focus was the protection of the healthcare workforce and inpatients from nosocomial spread of pandemic. the toll of this crisis was on NSLIJHS laboratory personnel. management created obligatory off-duty rotations to ensure our work force was as rested as possible. the major surge response stratagems guided NSLIJHS management actions throughout the crisis. the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 generated reports from an actual global outbreak. the ability of a laboratory to deploy molecular respiratory virus testing was felt to be key for a successful response to an infectious disease outbreak. we believe that there will be future infectious outbreaks that will strain the standing capacity of clinical laboratories, requiring effective implementation of surge capacity responses independent of public health laboratory support. public relations oversight Communications to news agencies were restricted to the System\u2019s public relations office *LIS, Laboratory Information Systems; System, North Shore\u2013Long Island Jewish Health System."}
