{"summary": "Griffithsin is a broad spectrum antiviral lectin that inhibits viral entry and maturation processes through binding clusters of oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins. an efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides. the methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry. process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics."}
