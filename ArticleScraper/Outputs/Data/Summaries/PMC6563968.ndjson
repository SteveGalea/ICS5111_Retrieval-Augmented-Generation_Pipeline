{"summary": "Background limited data is available about the etiology of influenza like illnesses (ILIs) in Qatar. results aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in the Qatar. approximately 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually are caused by influenza virus infection alone [1]. the world health organization (WHO) has implemented a national surveillance program for influenza and other ILIs associated viruses. a standardized ILI case definition according to the WHO was strictly followed. specimens from throat swabs, nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, and nasal aspirate were collected. laboratory testing tests for more than 20 respiratory pathogens are routinely performed at HMC. Statistical analysis Data was retrieved from the Ministry of Public Health in Qatar. subjects who had similar test results within 14 days were considered duplicates. the rate of infection of each virus was calculated as the proportion of positive specimens for that particular virus. sputum samples were collected for follow-up analysis from patients identified with MERS CoV infection. all specimens were collected in viral transport medium, stored at 4\u00b0 C, and sent to the virology laboratory of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) the rates of influenza infections were calculated out of 43,597. infection rates of other respiratory pathogens were calculated out of 37,929. results were considered statistically significant at p-value 0.05. influenza virus was the most frequently detected virus, reported in 9863 (22.6%) of all ILI patients. 7602 (77.1%) were typed as influenza A and 22.9% (2261) were typed as influenza B virus. other respiratory viruses were also reported at lower frequencies. influenza viruses were the dominant cause of ILIs in all six years. HRVs and HCoVs were the second and third most frequently detected viruses, with a positive rate ranging between 5.3%- 12.4% and 2.9%- 6.4%. HRVs infections had a significant increase in 2017 compared to previous years. the difference in the infection rate per year was calculated using Pearson Chi2. the difference in the infection rate per year was calculated using Pearson Chi2. 53 (2.9) 158 (3.8) 536 (6.4) 377 (4.7) 369 (5.2) 409 (4.8) 229E CoV 538 (1.4) 11 (0.6) 47 (1.1) 148 (1.8) 106 (1.3) 126 (1.8) 100 (1.2) NL63 CoV 244 (0.6) 6 (0.3) 23 (0.5) 71 (0.8) 36 (0.5) 44 (0.6) 64 (0.8) HKU1 CoV 391 (0.6) 10 ( pattern of seasonality Qatar is characterized by subtropical dry, hot desert climate with low annual rainfall, very high temperatures in summer and a big difference between maximum and minimum temperatures. the weather during spring and autumn is usually warm during the days and cooler at nights. the highest rates of influenza infections were seen between November and February during 2013 to 2017, with a detection rate up to 38.5% of all tested specimens. a unique pattern was observed in 2012, where the highest peaks of influenza infections were recorded during March and April (40% and 30% respectively), which declined afterwards to less than 5% starting from June to September. M. pneumonia infection accounted for 3% of ILIs infections. most of the cases were detected in the period between January and April. the percentage of positive cases was calculated out of the total tested samples. infection with HRVs, M. pneumoniae and adenoviruses inversely correlated with age. highest infection rate was detected in age groups below the age of 40 years. older age groups (>40 years) recorded lower rates reaching 0.6%. males had a strong statistical correlation with elevated HRVs (11.9%) and enteroviruses (1.1%) compared to females. males had a strong statistical correlation with elevated HRVs (11.9%) and enteroviruses (1.1%). females had significantly higher rates of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, HPIVs and HMPV infections (20.6%, 6%, 3.6%, 3.2% and 2.7% respectively) females had significantly higher rates of non-MERS HCoV, M. pneumonia, adenoviruses, HboV, and parechovirus infections compared between the two groups with no significant correlation. category 2012 No. (%) 2013 No. (%) 2014 No. (%) 2015 No. (%) 2016 No. (%) 2017 No. (%) Total No. (%) Gender Male 0 0 4527 (44.7) 5461 (61.3) 6002 (59.0) 15990 (36.6) Female 0 0 0 3491 (34.5) 3450 (38.7) 4176 (41.3) 11117 (25.5) Missing data 1817 (100) 4207 (100) 8357 (100) 2 ILI patients followed by HRVs and non-MERS HCoV (9.7% and 5% respectively) 7602 (77.1%) were typed as influenza A and 22.9% (2261) were typed as influenza B virus. other respiratory viruses were also reported at lower frequencies. influenza viruses were the dominant cause of ILIs in all six years.

NL63 CoV was more common in younger individuals (15\u201330 age group), accounting for 0.9% infection rate.
