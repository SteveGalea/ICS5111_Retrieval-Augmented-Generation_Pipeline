{"summary": "nasal and nasopharyngeal endoscopy should be performed regularly to detect possible evidence for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in rhino-pathologies of viral origin, the microscopic picture ischaracterized by fairly aspecific cellular changes gathered under the term \"ciliocytophthoria\" s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [10-12] focuses on specific microscopic and ultrastructural alterations in the nasal mucosal cells induced by EBV infection. case focuses on specific microscopic and ultrastructural alterations in the nasal mucosal cells induced by EBV infection. columnar cells were characterized by increased volume and pronounced multinucleation (12 nuclei were counted in some cells), vesicular chromatin with one or several nucleoli in the nucleus. the columnar multinuclear cells presented markedly a sparse and shortened ciliary ultrastructure. the vacuoles were positive for PAS staining. serologic tests were performed on blood serum and on nasal and pharyngeal smears. neoplasm was removed by endoscopy in local anesthesia. rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus) cause often benign respiratory illnesses, whereas others like cytomegalovirus produce much more severe diseases. an important agent among the latter is the EBV which causes infectious mononucleosis (IM), which generally affects adolescents and young adults. cytological alterations characterized by multinucleation were the most specific method to investigate the cytopathology. histologic inspection was less specific in that it revealed only marked angiectasic-edematous phenomena of the stroma and eosinophil lymphoplasma cell inflammatory infiltration. epithelial cytomorphology does not permit detection of multinucleation in histologic specimens. nasopharyngeal biopsies for EBV screening may be a useful aid in the early diagnosis of NPC. nasopharyngeal biopsies for EBV screening may be a useful aid in the early diagnosis of neoplasms especially in adults. cytological studies should be conducted on several samples of the neoplasm and the surrounding tissues to confirm the alterations described above that may be pathologically significant for an EBV infection. early diagnosis offers optimum chances for prompt treatment, considering the high sensitivity of NPC to radiation therapy of localized forms of the cancer."}
