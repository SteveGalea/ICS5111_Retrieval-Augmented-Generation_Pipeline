{"summary": "coVs have a positive-sense RNA genome of 30 kb in length, the largest found in any RNA viruses. six coVs that are able to infect humans have been identified, i.e., the four circulating strains human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63. only one reporter CoV was based on HCoV and applied to a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screening (14), but the SARS-CoV-GFP assay lacks sensitivity. experiments with this reporter virus require a biosafety level 3 facility, which is costly and labor-intensive. HCoV-OC43 carries two accessory genes, ns2 and ns12.9 (20) the ns2 gene encodes a protein of unknown function. the ns12.9 gene encodes a protein that was recently demonstrated as a viroporin involved in HCoV-OC43 morphogenesis and pathogenesis. Modified fragments of HCoV-OC43 cDNA were generated by overlapping PCR and cloned into NarI/PmeI-digested pBAC-OC43FL to generate pBAC-OC43-ns2DelRluc. the same strategies were employed for replacing the ns12.9 gene with Rluc gene or in-frame insertion of the Rluc gene into the ns12.9 gene. the anti-Renilla luciferase (ab185925), anti-double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase (anti-PKR) and anti-phosphorylated PKR (ab81303) rabbit monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the infrared IRDye 800CW-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) and IRDye 680RD goat pBAC-OC43FL, pBAC-OC43-ns2DelRluc, pBAC-OC43-ns2FusionRluc, pBAC-OC43-ns12.9StopRluc, or pBAC-OC43-ns12.9FusionRluc. transfected cells were washed three times with DMEM and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and an additional 96 the supernatants were harvested at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hpi. the titer for each virus at the indicated time point was determined by IFA. analysis of Rluc expression was performed in 48- or 96-well plates. an equal volume of each sample was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall) the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. the PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) rHCoVs-OC43 and parental HCoV-OC43-WT were passaged 13 times in BHK-21 cells. the titers of rHCoVs-OC43 from P1 to P13 were determined using IFA. rHCoVs rescued from transfected cells were defined as P0. culture supernatants from the transfected cells were added to naive cells to obtain passage 1 virus (P1) cell viability assay was performed using a cell Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega) cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate. after 24 h, various concentrations of chloroquine (0 to 80 M) and ribavirin were added to the medium. rOC43-ns2DelRluc cells in 96-well culture plates were infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc, followed by incubation with chloroquine or ribavirin for 72 h; the Rluc activity was then measured as described above. a nontargeting siRNA having no matches to the viral or human genome served as a blank control. 12-day-old mice were inoculated with 500 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc. brains were homogenized in 500 l of PBS containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B. after 5 rounds of serial passages, the rOC43-ns2DelRluc was passaged to P5. cloned into NarI/PmeI-digested pBAC-OC43FL to generate pBAC-OC43-ns2DelRluc or pBAC-OC43-ns2FusionRluc. the same strategies were employed for replacing the ns12.9 gene with Rluc gene or in-frame insertion of the Rluc gene into the ns12.9 gene. further details are available on request. the anti-flag (f7425) rabbit monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the anti-eIF2 (D7D3), anti-phosphorylated-eIF2 (Ser51) (D9G8), anti-DDX3X (D19B4), and anti-actin (13E5) rabbit monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. transfected cells were washed three times with DMEM and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. rHCoVs-OC43-WT was obtained from the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-OC43FL. titers of rHCoVs-OC43 were determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) analysis of Rluc expression was performed in 48- or 96-well plates. HEK-293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a cell density of 2.5 105 cells per well. next day, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing DDX3X or TBK1. infrared IRDye 800CW-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (1:10,000) (Li-Cor) or IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (1:10,000) (Li-Cor) blots were scanned on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) RNA isolation and RT-PCR. mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) rHCoVs-OC43 and their parental HCoV-OC43-WT were passaged 13 times in BHK-21 cells. cells in a 25-cm2 flask were infected with the rescued rHCoVs-OC43 and HCoV-OC43-WT. rHCoVs rescued from transfected cells were defined as P0. culture supernatants from the transfected cells (P0) were added to naive cells to obtain passage 1 virus (P1) after 13 rounds of serial passages, the reporter viruses were passaged to P13. at 72 h, the plates were equilibrated at room temperature for 60 min. 100 l of cell Titer-Glo reagent was added to the medium. after a final incubation, the luminescence was measured using a Glomax luminometer system (Promega) HEK-293T cells plated in poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated 48-well plates were transfected with siRNA pools using X-tremeGene siRNA transfection reagent (Roche) at a final concentration of 300 nM. cells were then infected in triplicate with rOC43-ns2DelRluc at an MOI of 0.01. rHCoVs-OC43 expressing Rluc is a valuable screening tool for identifying novel antiviral drugs or host factors. the use of a reporter virus is a valuable screening tool for identifying novel antiviral drugs or host factors. rOC43-ns2DelRluc showed impaired growth kinetics, with a peak titer of 104.8 TCID50s/ml at 144 hpi, which was 27-fold lower than that of the parental HCoV-OC43-WT. this result indicated that the ns2 gene is nonessential for virus replication. BHK-21 cells were infected with rHCoVs and HCoV-OC43-WT at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. data represent three independent experiments and are shown as means standard deviations. HCoV-OC43-WT were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OC43-N, anti-Rluc, and anti-actin antibodies. at 72 h postinfection (MOI = 0.01), total cellular mRNAs were extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. data were normalized to the levels of internal mouse GAPDH mRNA. Western blotting was performed to confirm the Rluc expression levels of the reporter viruses at 72 and 96 hpi. results showed similar expression levels of N proteins in rOC43-ns2FusionRluc and rOC43-ns2DelRluc. expression of the ns2-Rluc fusion protein of rOC43-ns2FusionRluc was significantly reduced compared with that of Rluc proteins of rOC43-ns2DelRluc 2DelRluc was only 2.3-fold higher than that of ns2 of HCoV-OC43-WT. replacement of the ns12.9 gene with the Rluc gene caused a slight reduction in the Rluc or ns12.9-Rluc sgmRNA level during infection. this result indicated that the ns2 gene is not required for HCoV-OC43 replication and that high-expression reporter virus can be generated by replacing the ns2 rHCoVs-OC43-ns2DelRluc remained genetically stable during 10 passages. rOC43-ns2DelRluc remained genetically stable after 5 passages in mice. rOC43-ns2DelRluc remained genetically stable after 5 passages. rOC43-ns2DelRluc showed sensitivity similar to that of the parental HCoV-OC43-WT. chloroquine treatment had a significant inhibitory effect on HCoV-OC43-WT or rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication at low-micromolar concentrations. ribavirin showed no inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. at 72 h postinfection, supernatants were removed and subsequently analyzed for viral load by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. rluc activity of rOC43-ns2DelRluc was normalized to that of DMSO-treated control cells. rOC43-ns2DelRluc-based Rluc assay allows more sensitive and more rapid quantification of viral replication than the traditional quantitative RT-PCR assay. 106.2 RLU in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells at 72 hpi and the Rluc activity could be detected without extracting viral RNA. this reporter virus was employed to screen host factors that inhibit HCoV-OC43 replication. PKR and DDX3X are potential anti-HCoV-OC43 host factors. cell viability assay showed no significant differences between cells transfected with host factor siRNA pools and control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. efficiency of RNAi-mediated knockdown was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. PKR is the strongest antiviral host factor identified in the primary siRNA screening assay. cells infected with HCoV-OC43-WT strongly induced PKR activation at 8 and 12 hpi. phosphorylation of eIF2 showed high basal levels at 8 and 12 hpi. mRNA level of GADD34 showed a 5-fold increase in HCoV-OC43-infected Huh7 cells at 24 hpi. this was a feedback loop to mediate eIF-2 dephosphorylation at the corresponding time point. a slight increase of the mRNA level may play an important role in facilitating HCoV-OC43 replication during its invasion period. HCoV-OC43 infection induces the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2. Huh7 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 or mock infected at an MOI of 0.05 and harvested at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hpi. DDX3X is another potent antiviral host factor identified in the siRNA screening assay. human DDX3X is a critical molecule in innate immune signaling pathways and contributes to type I interferon (IFN) induction. oV-OC43-WT increased by 1.7-fold in DDX3X-silenced cells. overexpression of DDX3X showed antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43 infection. DDX3X may play an antiviral role during HCoV-OC43 infection. d and internal control plasmid pRL-TK (20 ng) showed weak antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43. cells were transfected with pFlag-DDX3X or empty vector. titers of HCoV-OC43-WT were determined at 72 hpi. rOC43-ns2FusionRluc and rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc showed replication kinetics similar to that of HCoV-OC43-WT. the viral titer of rOC43-ns2DelRluc was only 4-fold lower than that of HCoV-OC43-WT at 144 hpi, indicating that the ns2 gene is nonessential for virus replication. the loss of infectious virus production by deletion of the ns2 gene could be compensated for by transient expression of ns2 in BHK21 cells. at 72 h postinfection, virus-infected BHK-21 cells were incubated with anti-OC43-N mouse polyclonal antibodies and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. proteins in cell lysates of BHK-21 cells infected with rHCoVs and HCoV-OC43-WT were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OC43-N, anti-Rluc, and anti-actin antibodies. data were normalized to the levels of internal mouse mRNA. rOC43-ns12.9StopRluc showed 107 Rluc activity at 144 hpi. rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc showed relatively high Rluc activity. however, rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc showed 107 RLU at 144 hpi. ns2 (HCoV-OC43-WT), ns2 (rOC43-ns2DelRluc or rOC43-ns12.9StopRluc), ns2-Rluc fusion (rOC43-ns2FusionRluc), and ns12.9-Rluc fusion (rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc) genes were detected using semiquantitative PCR. the sgmRNA level of rOC43-ns2FusionRluc and rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc showed 4- to 6-fold reductions in Rluc activity during the 13 passages. viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of infected cells of each passage. the rluc gene remained intact in the genomes of all rHCoVs-OC43. rOC43-ns2DelRluc remained genetically stable after 5 passages in mice. the viral titers in brain tissues were 107.1 TCID50s/g at 3 days postinoculation. rOC43-ns2DelRluc showed sensitivity similar to that of the parental HCoV-OC43-WT. effects of chloroquine or ribavirin on replication of HCoV-OC43-WT or rOC43-ns2DelRluc. at 72 h postinfection, supernatants were removed and analyzed for viral load by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. rOC43-ns2DelRluc-based assay allows more sensitive and more rapid quantification of viral replication than the traditional quantitative RT-PCR assay. ribavirin exhibited an inhibitory effect at concentrations of 3 M or higher, with an IC50 of 10.00 M and a CC50 of 156.16 M. knockdown TRIM56 increased Rluc activity 1.62-fold compared to control cells. knockdown double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) or dEAD box RNA helicases (DDX3X) could significantly enhance Rluc activity, indicating that PKR and DDX3X are potential anti-HCoV-OC43 host factors. PKR is the strongest antiviral host factor identified in the primary siRNA screening assay. PKR is the strongest antiviral host factor identified in the primary siRNA screening assay. reduction of endogenous PKR (PKR 2 and PKR 3) resulted in an obvious increase in both HCoV-OC43-WT and rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication. a 1.83-fold increase in Rluc activity or virus titer, indicating that PKR plays an antiviral role in HCoV-OC43-infected cells. mRNA level of GADD34 showed a 5-fold increase in rOC43-ns2DelRluc activity was significantly decreased at a concentration of 4 nM, with 10-fold inhibition observed at a concentration of 108 nM. this result was further confirmed by HCoV-OC43-WT, which showed obviously reduced virus titers (11-fold) at a concentration of 108 nM. this inhibition was blocked by HCoV-OC43-induced GADD34 expression. rOC43-ns2DelRluc and titers of HCoV-OC43-WT were determined at 72 hpi. DDX3X is another potent antiviral host factor identified in the siRNA screening assay. overexpression of TBK1 causes DDX3X activation. overexpression of DDX3X alone activated the IFN promoter only 2-fold. overexpression of DDX3X showed antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43 infection. hek-293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of plasmids encoding DDX3X or TBKI. overexpression of DDX3X shows weak antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43. titers of HCoV-OC43-WT were determined at 72 hpi. only one reporter HCoV (SARS-CoV-GFP) has been generated and applied to an siRNA library screening assay (14) this reporter virus assay must be performed in a BSL3 facility, which is costly and labor-intensive. a sensitive antiviral screening platform based on recombinant HCoV-OC43 (rOC43-ns2DelRluc) expresses Rluc as a reporter gene. rOC43-ns2FusionRluc and rOC43-ns12.9FusionRluc showed replication kinetics similar to those of HCoV-OC43-WT. one reporter virus, rOC43-ns2DelRluc, had replication kinetics similar to those of HCoV-OC43-WT. deletion of ns2 gene had no influence on pathogenicity of rOC43-ns2DelRluc in rOC43-ns2DelRluc was used to evaluate the antiviral activity of chloroquine and ribavirin in 96-well plates. rOC43-ns2DelRluc showed no impairment in response to drug treatment compared with HCoV-OC43-WT. in the past decade, reporter viruses have been used widely for screening pooled siRNAs to discover host factors that can influence replication of diverse positive-strand RNA viruses. eight potential antiviral host factors in flavivirus infection were selected for RNAi screening using the reporter rOC43-ns2DelRluc. this led to the identification of two anti-HCoV-OC43 host factors (PKR and DDX3X) many viral families have evolved various regulatory mechanisms that modulate host protein synthesis to maximize the production of progeny viruses. hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection (43, 44). the core protein of HCV interacts with DDX3X to manipulate splicing and regulation of transcription or translation. the helicase activity of DDX3X was required for HIV RNA export."}
