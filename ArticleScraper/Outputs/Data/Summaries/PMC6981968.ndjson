{"summary": "the first case of MERS-CoV infection in a 68-year-old man was confirmed in south Korea on 20 May 2015. as of July 2015, 186 cases of MERS-CoV and 36 related deaths have been reported in south Korea. this fatality rate is the second highest in the world. the government revised its policy to disclose information in accordance with the public\u2019s opinion that nondisclosure of information would in fact cause MERS-CoV to spread and generate public anxiety. it has been claimed that inadequate information disclosure was the main reason for the spread of MERS-CoV. laboratory-confirmed cases released by the Korean government were included as a dependent variable. the date of disclosure of the hospital list and daily number of quarantined individuals were included as independent variables. the daily number of quarantined individuals was used to adjust for the epidemic status of MERS-CoV in Korea. the first MERS-CoV patient and secondary case were confirmed on 20 May 2015. this was the highest number of confirmed cases recorded on a single day during the study period. the spread of the disease ceased because potential MERS-CoV patients were screened. results of sensitivity analyses were almost consistent with those shown in Table 1. the following mechanisms were presumably involved in the downward trend of infection. the information dissemination was likely to lower the possibility of the public\u2019s further contracting MERS-CoV, as it helped members of the public to avoid exposed hospitals with the given information by the health authority. naylor et al. have suggested that communication between authorities and the public is the cornerstone of crisis management in the healthcare and public health system. et al. have suggested that communication between authorities and the public is the cornerstone of crisis management in the healthcare and public health system. the transmission of MERS-CoV in Korea occurred mainly in hospitals [16]. people also avoided outings as a preventive measure against MERS-CoV. further research including more individual and hospital level data is needed."}
