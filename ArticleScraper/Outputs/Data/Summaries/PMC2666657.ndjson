{"summary": "surfactant protein-A plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function. the mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood. ozone exposure has been reported to disrupt epithelial integrity, impair effective phagocytosis, and compromise mucociliary clearance. other studies where increased epithelial permeability and changes in ventilation are not observed indicate that these effects may be highly ozone dose-dependent [5]. ozone-dependent changes in epithelial permeability have been attributed to TLR-4-mediated changes in iNOS activity. role for oxidative stress in ozone-induced pathophysiology has been postulated based on increases in F2-isoprostane [13], a lipid peroxidation product, and reduction in inflammatory mediators. a series of studies have explored the role of SP-A in vivo in ozone exposure and innate immunity. these include serving as an opsonin for the recognition of some pathogens [23,24], regulating the production of cell surface antigens and inflammatory mediator expression by some immune cells [25,26], participating in the development of dendritic cells [27], regulating reactive oxidant production [28,29], and others [30]. ozone exposure increases susceptibility of mice to infection, at least in part due to the oxidation of SP-A [9] and that KO mice are more susceptible to infection than WT mice [16] this type of unbiased approach is not dependent upon previously published studies. a proteomics technique for quantitation and identification of proteins has been used in quantitative comparisons of protein expression. 2D-DIGE and MALDI-ToF were used to examine the impact of ozone on lung injury in the presence or absence of SP-A. experimental model A total of 16 five to six week old mice were divided into four groups with 4 animals per group. mice were exposed to either 2 parts/million (ppm) ozone or to filtered air (KOO3) for 3 hours. the cell-free BAL supernatant was frozen at -80\u00b0C for subsequent proteomic studies. the cell-free BAL supernatant was resuspended in 0.9% sodium chloride. ice cold 100% TCA was added to four volumes of protein sample for each individual pool of flow-through fractions, which were mixed and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were centrifuged (15,000 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) and the protein pellets washed with 250 l of chilled acetone, centrifuged again, resuspended in a minimum volume of standard cell lysis buffer. an equal volume of 2 sample buffer (2 M thiourea, 7 M urea, 2% pH 3\u201310 nonlinear (NL) IPG buffer was added to all samples including the unlabeled preparative gel sample. an equal volume of 2 sample buffer (2 M thiourea, 7 M urea, 2% pH 3\u201310 nonlinear (NL) IPG buffer, 1.2% DeStreak reagent) was added to all samples including the unlabeled preparative IEF strips were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels (26 cm-w 20 cm-h 1 mm thick), sealed with 0.5% low melting point agarose containing bromophenol blue in a buffer of 1 Tris/glycine/SDS buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% (W/V) SDS, pH 8.3) for the preparative picking gel and the gels used to confirm depletion, a single plate for each two-dimensional gels were imaged on a Typhoon 9410 fluorescent imager (GE Healthcare) at a resolution of 100 m. photomultiplier tube voltages were individually set for each of the three colored lasers to ensure maximum, linear signals. the same voltages were used for all the gels. protein spots were picked from picking gels using a robot-directed spot picker. the spots were determined on the basis of differential expression from the 2D-DIGE analysis. some unchanged proteins were also picked for identification. a total of 2 l of ZipTip cleaned samples (1 l at a time) was applied onto a 384-well MALDI plate. a 0.7 l of 2 mg/ml ACH cinnamic acid was spotted on each well containing peptide. MS/MS was performed without collision-induced decay in a mass range from 60 Da to 20 Da below the precursor mass with a fragment tolerance of 0.2 Da for +1 charged ions. a protein was considered identified if the MASCOT confidence interval was > 95th percentile. those proteins with a MASCOT confidence interval 95% were excluded from subsequent analyses. experimental model A total of 16 five to six week old mice (20\u201325 g) were divided into four groups with 4 animals per group. mice were exposed to either 2 parts/million (ppm) ozone or to filtered air. cell-free BAL supernatant was frozen at -80\u00b0C for subsequent proteomic studies. depletion of high abundance serum proteins (albumin, transferrin, IgG) from mouse BAL. ice cold 100% TCA was added to four volumes of protein sample for each individual pool of flow-through fractions. samples were centrifuged (15,000 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) and pellets washed with 250 l of chilled acetone. concentration of protein was brought to 1 mg/ml for CyDye labeling. each sample (16 samples) and an aliquot of the pool was labeled with Cy2 (200 picomoles) equal amounts of Cy3-labeled sample, Cy5-labeled sample, and Cy2-labeled pool samples were mixed. the use of a normalization pool is advantageous as this serves as an internal standardization tool for all gels/samples under study. gels were sealed with 0.5% low melting point agarose containing bromophenol blue in a buffer of 1 Tris/glycine/SDS buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% (W/V) SDS, pH 8.3) for the preparative picking gel and the gels used to confirm depletion, a single plate was treated with Bind-Silane solution. all two-dimensional gels were imaged on a Typhoon 9410 fluorescent imager (GE Healthcare) at a resolution of 100 m. photomultiplier tube voltages were individually set for each of the three colored lasers. the same voltages were used for all the gels. the first two principal components, which contained the largest variance, allowed the best discrimination between the groups. protein spots (2.0 mm diameter cores) were picked from picking gels using a robot-directed spot picker (Ettan spot picker, GE Healthcare) a total of 2 l of ZipTip cleaned samples (1 l at a time) was applied onto a 384-well MALDI plate. a 0.7 l of 2 mg/ml ACH cinnamic acid was spotted on each well containing peptide. MS/MS was performed without collision-induced decay in a mass range from 60 Da to 20 Da below the precursor mass with a fragment tolerance of 0.2 Da for +1 charged ions. a protein was considered identified if the MASCOT confidence interval was > 95th percentile. those proteins with a MASCOT confidence interval 95% were excluded from the subsequent analyses. KO mice behaved similarly during the ozone exposure period. the total number of cells recoverable in BAL fluid from WT and KO mice was similar. but there were statistically significant increases in the percentage of PMNs in ozone-exposed mice vs. FA-exposed mice. the removal of these proteins from BAL resulted in the removal of 85\u201390% of total mass of BAL protein. about 10\u201315% of the total protein applied to the column emerging in the flow-through fractions. similar recovery in terms of protein content in the flow-through fraction was observed in all samples under study. each of the 16 independent animals (4/group) represented by the markers in the figure represents the combined weighted average of the first two principal components for each of the 454 protein spots. each of the four experimental groups are tightly clustered with no overlap among groups. the antecedents for each of the abbreviated molecular functions and biological processes are included in the legend for Additional File 3. all subsequent analyses were restricted to the 66 proteins identified by MALDI-ToF/ToF. for these analyses the values for the normalized volumes for all of the protein spots (isoforms) making up each identified protein were added together. 0.05 WTFA vs KOO3 p 0.05 WTFA vs KOO3 p 0.05 WTFA WTO3 KOFA KOO3 Adipsin (complement factor D) 2.05 (0.337) 2.43 (0.610) 2.13 (0.742) 2.34 (0.655) Alpha-1-antitrypsin 1-1 1.18 (0.191) 1.04 (0.102) 1.35 (0.369) 0.94 (0.210) Alpha 1-antitrypsin 1.04 (0.212) * 0.74 (0.248) 1.24 (0.261) * Complement component C5 7.26 (0.617) 6.88 (0.999) 7.32 (0.692) 6.08 (0.766) Esterase 1 2.73 (0.187) 3.85 (0.960) * 3.31 (0.220) 4.44 (0.687) * * Ferritin (light chain) 1.43 (0.325) 1.21 (0.180) 1.34 (0.382) 1.13 (0.380) Gluth the proteins assigned to the defense and immunity category (DEF) are listed (n = 30) an asterisk indicates whether levels of expression are increased () or decreased () in response to ozone. protein binding molecules such as iron, copper, and heme are involved in processes related to redox balance in the lung (RED) these include proteins generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), neutralizing RONS, and proteins binding molecules such as iron, copper, and heme. this diversity of proteins is essential in the oxidative environment of the lung where there are high oxygen levels.

KO mice (Table 1; WTFA vs KOFA) were observed in 4 of the 30 proteins (excluding SP-A) and between ozone-exposed WT and KO mice in 2 proteins (Table 1; WTO3 vs. KOO3). in response to ozone there were increases in 13 proteins and decreases in 17. the ozone-induced changes were statistically significant for 8 proteins in the WT mice (WTFA vs. WTO3) and 10 in the KO mice (KOFA vs. KOO3) in the PMM group of proteins there were 10 proteins (56%) where the % change in response to ozone exposure was greater in the KO mice than in the KO mice. the % change in the response to ozone was of greater magnitude in the KO mice than in the WT mice. in all three functional protein groups, the changes in ozone-exposed mice were greater in the KO mice than in the WT mice. this trend was particularly pronounced: a) in the DEF group of proteins where 21 (72%) of the 29 changing proteins underwent greater changes in the KO mice than in the WT. in many of the proteins showing a change from one group to another a common pattern was observed. levels of expression in KOFA mice are closer to WTO3 mice than to WTFA mice. changes in specific proteins are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. a progressive increase is observed as one progresses from WTFA to KOFA to KOO3. in roughly two-thirds of the proteins listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 KOFA values differed from WTFA values in the same manner (increasing or decreasing) as WTFA. a number of studies have described disruptions in SP-A function following exposure to ozone or other oxidants and others have presented evidence indicating that SP-A may have antioxidant function. KO mice sustained greater tissue damage after ozone exposure and were more susceptible to infection. KO mice expressed many proteins at levels equivalent to or even exceeding, indicating that KO mice may be subject to oxidative stress, even in the absence of the exogenous ozone-induced oxidative stress. KO mice expressed many proteins at levels equivalent to, or even exceeding, WTO3, indicating that KO mice may be subject to oxidative stress. a case in point is the analysis of cytokines and chemokines that may be involved in ozone-induced inflammation. the functional redundancy of some of these molecules can complicate interpretation. one of the proteins they found to differ between strains, was peroxiredoxin 6. in 2D-DIGE to internally standardize the protein spots of all BAL samples in all gels. a protein that is highly susceptible to oxidation was oxidized immediately after ozone exposure. this delayed oxidation coincides with an influx of neutrophils into the alveolar space. gene ablation of SP-A increases susceptibility of the SP-A KO mouse to organisms whose recognition and clearance are highly dependent on SP-A. increased levels of SP-A can predispose the host to organisms, such as group B streptococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. in many cases the baseline (FA-exposed) value of the KOFA mice differed from the WTFA group. for example, lactate dehydrogenase and sec14-like 3 levels were reduced after ozone exposure. the corresponding levels in the KOFA group were similar to the WTO3 group. lack of SP-A may contribute to increased oxidative stress, even under normal conditions. lack of SP-A may contribute to increased oxidative stress, even under normal conditions. redox balance were decreases, a finding that would be consistent with increased degradation of proteins that had been oxidatively modified while neutralizing reactive oxidants. ozone exposure has been reported to prime pulmonary innate immunity, and thereby enhance the response to LPS [111] ozone-induced changes in the KOO3 mice were similar to trends observed in the WTO3 mice. but the magnitude of the change was greater in the KOO3 mice than in the WTO3 mice. comparison of the values of KOFA mice with the WTFA and WTO3 values revealed another very interesting point. KOFA mice are under chronic oxidative stress due to lack of SP-A. many changes in the KOFA mice are likely due to oxidative stress. KOFA mice are under chronic oxidative stress due to lack of SP-A. the lack of SP-A may contribute to an added oxidative stress following O3 exposure via the reduction in PMN recruitment. based on similarities and differences in protein levels among the groups under study, it is likely that different and overlapping mechanisms are operative. the susceptibility of SP-A to oxidation shown by previous studies makes it ideally suited to play a role as a \"sacrificial antioxidant\" the authors declare that they have no competing interests. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.
