{"summary": "TTSH is an acute-care hospital in Singapore with 1,100 beds and 6,000 healthcare workers. it has a designated center, the Communicable Disease Centre, for management of emerging infections. the first case-patient with the infection in Singapore did not receive a diagnosis and was not admitted to the hospital until May 26, 2009. symptom reviews covered episodes of ARI, defined as a new onset illness with any respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough), with febrile respiratory illness (FRI) being an ARI episode with self-reported fever or a body temperature (where available) >37.5\u00b0C. exposure data covered nonoccupational exposures such as travel out of Singapore and episodes of ARI and FRI in household members. patients with the most severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections were excluded. enrollment stopped 2 weeks after the first TTSH staff member received a diagnosis of pandemic. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were tested following standard protocols. HI assay was assessed on paired serum samples from 56 case-patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed by reverse transcription\u2013PCR. seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titers between the first and second blood specimens. TTSH is an acute-care hospital in Singapore with 1,100 beds and 6,000 healthcare workers. it has a designated center, the Communicable Disease Centre, for management of outbreaks of emerging infections. symptom reviews covered episodes of ARI, defined as a new onset illness with any respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough), with febrile respiratory illness (FRI), with self-reported fever or a body temperature (where available) >37.5\u00b0C. symptom reviews covered episodes of ARI, defined as a new onset illness with any respiratory symptoms. mobile teams were sent to appropriate hospital locations such as wards, outpatient clinics, and other major work areas. the designated isolation wards for patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, the emergency department through which patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were being admitted, and the medical intensive care and high-dependency units where patients with the most severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections were treated. serum titrated in 2-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:1,280 in phosphate-buffered saline. HI was read after 30 min, with titers expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which hemagglutination was prevented. we performed logistic regression with demographic information, seasonal influenza vaccine status, titers in the baseline sample, occupational and nonoccupational related exposures. results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with asymptotic Wald 95% CI and 2-sided p values. nonseroconverters were higher than in baseline samples from seroconverters. 63% and 51% reported having an ARI and FRI episode. only 15% and 8% of nonseroconverters reported having an ARI and FRI episode. most of our participants were nurses (290/531, 55%; Table 2); allied health staff, which included mostly participants from paramedical professions. ancillary and support staff, which included mostly hospital attendants and patient service associates, formed the next largest group. allied health staff were designated the reference group for computing ORs. 116 2 (2) Referent Nurses 290 28 (10) 6.1 (1.4\u201326.0) 0.02 Ancilllary and support 69 2 (3) 1.7 (0.2\u201312.4) 0.60 Administration 35 2 (6) 3.5 (0.5\u201325.5) 0.22 Doctors 21 1 (5) 2.9 (0.2\u201332.9) 0.40 Direct patient contact No 71 4 (6) Referent Yes 460 31 (7) 1.2 (0.4\u20133.5) 0.73 Primary work area Nonpatient care areas 83 6 (7) Refer healthcare workers from larger households had increased odds of seroconversion. no discernible association was seen between seroconversion and having another healthcare worker in the same household. having a child or adolescent in the household increased the odds of seroconversion. having pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards as a primary work area (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3\u201315.6; p = 0.06) and coming from a larger household (OR 1.2 per additional household member, 95% CI 1.0\u20131.4; p = 0.06) were of borderline significance. having higher HI titers in baseline serum sample was protective. allied health participants are compared with nurses, the groups with the lowest and highest seroconversion rates respectively. the proportion who seroconverted was slightly, but not significantly, higher in ward-based nurses than in non-ward-based nurses. ward-based nurses were significantly more likely to have had seasonal influenza vaccine than were allied health workers. n = 187 p values 2 vs. 1 3 vs. 1 3 vs. 2 Seroconverted in study period, % 2 (0\u20136) 8 (4\u201315) 11 (7\u201316) 0.05 0.01 0.53 Mean age, y 32 (30\u201333) 34 (32\u201336) 32 (31\u201334) 0.14 0.81 0.21 Mean household size 4.8 (4.4\u20135.1) 4.8 (4.4\u20135.2) 5.5 (5.1\u20135.8) 0.96 0.01 0. patients who had pandemic (H1N1) 2009 14 (9\u201321) 19 (13\u201328) 41 (34\u201348) 0.28 0.01 0.01 0.01 Contact with colleague(s) who had pandemic (H1N1) 2009 2 (0\u20136) 15 (9\u201323) 14 (10\u201320) 0.01 0.86 *Values in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals. a high level of preparedness and widespread implementation of airborne and respiratory droplet precautions and other pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection control practices in healthcare institutions in the united states, Singapore, and elsewhere. some occupational factors associated with seroconversion should be interpreted with some caution. studies on nonpandemic influenza have found that index cases from pediatric age groups were more likely to generate secondary cases. the effect of having children in the household was superseded in multivariate analysis by overall household size. seasonal influenza vaccination rates may be atypically high in TTSH because of its designated status as a first-line screening and referral center. 1 study on healthcare workers from 2 other hospitals in Singapore found that only 39% of participants were vaccinated (30)."}
