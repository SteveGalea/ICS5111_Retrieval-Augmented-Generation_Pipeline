{"summary": "the spike (S) gene of PEDV encodes the spike glycoprotein and can be divided into S1 and S2 domains, just as in other coronaviruses (9\u201311). the spike (S) gene of PEDV encodes the spike glycoprotein and can be divided into S1 and S2 domains, just as in other coronaviruses. pigs of all ages are affected and exhibit different degrees of diarrhea and loss of appetite. PEDV genomes were used to analyze genome characteristics and evaluate the genetic stability of the virus. from April 2011 to march 2014, nine intestinal homogenates and two feces samples were collected from pigs that had severe diarrhea and a high mortality rate at 11 farms. the minced intestinal and blended feces were used to generate a 10% (g/ml) homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the final supernatants were used immediately or stored at 20\u00b0C. a SMARTer rapid amplification kit (Clontech, Japan) confirmed the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome, according to the manufacturer's instructions. a QIAquick gel extraction kit (TaKaRa, Shanghai, China) was used to purify the synthesized DNA. each nucleotide was identified from the replicates that gave identical results. phylogenetic analysis was performed following the procedures outlined by Chen et al. (15). phylogenetic trees were constructed separately with the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software package (v.5.0.3) (27) using the neighbor-joining method. analysis of nucleotide positions distinguishing PEDV classical and pandemic groups (DCP) the calculation method for the DCP positions is shown in Fig. S1B in the supplemental material. phylogenetic tree of 219 complete S genes was constructed based on a ClustalW alignment of full-length nucleotide sequences of the S gene. some strains had no basic information or available whole-genome or S gene sequences. some strains from Taiwan and Vietnam were not included in this count. the sequences determined in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KM609203 to KM609213. from April 2011 to march 2014, nine intestinal homogenates and two feces samples were collected from pigs that had severe diarrhea and a high mortality rate. samples were collected individually and placed in separate sterile containers. the minced intestinal and blended feces were used to generate a 10% homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the final supernatants were used immediately or stored at 20\u00b0C. RT-PCR products were excised and a QIAquick gel extraction kit was used to purify the synthesized DNA. each nucleotide was identified from the replicates that gave identical results. phylogenetic analysis was performed following the procedures outlined by Chen et al. (15). phylogenetic trees were constructed separately with the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software package (v.5.0.3) (27) using the neighbor-joining method, with p-distance, complete gap deletion, and bootstrapping (n = 1,000) parameters. the calculation method for the DCP values is shown in Fig. S1B in the supplemental material. some DCP nucleotide positions are indicated by blue boxes as typical examples. the number of DCP positions defined the DCP value. the strains were located in isolated provinces or countries shown in Fig. 4. the location was accurate at the province level, whereas for others, only the country of origin was known. a time-based geographical dissection of Asian strains was conducted. 11 whole genomes of Chinese PEDV isolates collected from different districts at different times were sequenced. all of the whole genomes were 28,038 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A tail. gene. V1, V2, V3, and V4 are located on the whole genome of the AH2012 strain. the phylogenetic tree of 49 PEDV genomes indicated that the PEDV isolates could be divided into two clusters, designated the pandemic group and the classical group. phylogenetic trees of whole PEDV genomes (A), complete S genes encoded in the 49 whole PEDV genomes (B), and the corresponding N-terminal domain (NTD) sequences (C) were constructed based on ClustalW alignments of their respective nucleic acid sequences. the sequences in red and branches were revealed for the first time in this study. ed differently in the trees of the S gene and the NTD region compared with the entire genome tree. there was also some small dissimilarity in the pandemic group. the NTD region tree was very similar to the entire S gene tree, except for strain PEDV-7C in the pandemic group. phylogeny-based geographical dissection of PEDV strains in Asia. the group that included all the strains in the whole-genome pandemic cluster remained. the group that included all the strains in the whole-genome pandemic cluster remained and was termed the pandemic group (PX) the clinical strains from PX1a were the main epidemic subgroup of PEDV outbreaks in China. the strains were isolated from south Korea, Japan, and china from 1986 to 2013. the common strains were relatively simple, whereas in china, PEDV had spread into every province around the coastal regions. strains in china were located accurately for every province, but the other data only provided the country of origin. a severe PED epizootic was affecting pigs of all ages in many provinces of China. the prevalence of PEDV infections was low and only sporadic outbreaks occurred in south Korea. phylogenetic tree of 49 PEDV genomes indicated that the PEDV isolates could be divided into two clusters, designated the pandemic group and the classical group. phylogenetic tree of 49 PEDV genomes indicated that the PEDV isolates could be divided into two clusters. the 11 isolates first reported in the present study were all clustered into the pandemic group. only the PEDV-7C strain was closely clustered with the CHGD-01 (26), GD-1 (34), CH/GDGZ/2012 (35), and GD-A (36) strains. 79 nt (24.5%) were located in the 1- to 1,179-bp region of the S gene. this region, which is included in the V2 region, resulted in 49 amino acid changes. phylogenetic trees for the full-length S gene and the NTD region collectively showed the same grouping structure as the tree generated from the PEDV whole genomes. four strains (CHZ, 7C, SD-M, and LZC), as representatives, were subjected to further analysis of their antigenic index and the hydrophilicity plot for the NTD (1 to 360 amino acids) of the S protein. the main antigenic index differences were located at amino acids 53 to 73 and 118 to 165. four subgroups (PX1a, PX1c, CX1a, and CX1b) contained only Chinese strains. the clinical strains from PX1a were the main subgroup of PEDV outbreaks in China. the clinical strains from PX1a were the main subgroup responsible for outbreaks in south Korea. the information on the epidemics was not detailed enough to be analyzed in this study. a severe PED epizootic was affecting pigs of all ages in many provinces of china. between 2012 and 2014, PEDV caused widespread outbreaks in Thailand, South Korea, and China, even extending to Taiwan (38) and Vietnam (39). DISCUSSION In recent years, PEDV has continued to cause severe economic damage to the swine industry in Asia. the V2 region was the most appropriate to evaluate the evolutionary relationship of PEDV strains and to cluster PEDV strains into the pandemic and classical groups. the antigenic index analysis of the V2 region showed enhanced antigenicity in the pandemic group compared with the classical group. the classical vaccine strains cannot effectively control the spread of the pandemic group strains at present. the 219 PEDV strains in Asia were clustered into pandemic and classical groups. the PX1a, PX1c, CX1a, and CX1c strain subgroups were only epidemic in China, while the PX2b and PX2c subgroups were not detected. a widespread outbreak has not occurred in Japan. in the process of spreading, PEDV underwent numerous genetic variations. the V2 region plays important roles in PEDV genetic evolution and pathogenicity."}
