{"summary": "the identification of causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel. all assays include the most common respiratory pathogens. compared with the detection of 13 different viruses in one sample. multiple infections were detected in 16 TS samples (32%) by RespiFinder-19. the most frequent viruses were adenovirus (32%) and PIV-2 (20%). several multiplex tests are commercially available. a number of studies have already compared the detection frequencies of multiplex assays with conventional monoplexPCR assays in clinical samples. a comparison of the analytical sensitivity of these multiplex assays with quantified standardized control material does not exist. the sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the RespiFinder-19 assay. this is the first screening study determining the incidence of infections with respiratory pathogens in a mechanically ventilated patient cohort. adenovirus (from position 18895 to 18968, accession number AC_000008), influenza A virus (from position 144 to 238, accession number CY041531), RSV-A (from position 1801 to 1949, accession number M11486), enterovirus (from position 455 to 602, accession number D00820) and rhinovirus (from position 356 to 563, accession number D00239) were established. nucleic acid extraction The total nucleic acid from inoculated samples and tracheal secretion samples was extracted using the NucliSENSeasyMAG automated system. nucleic acids were extracted from 500 l of TS samples and 200 l of inoculated samples. they were eluted in a final volume of 55 l or 100 l elution buffer. the manufacturer of the RVP assay recommend an elution volume of 100 l. the RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the assays included a preamplification step, followed by a probe hybridization step, a probe ligation step and a probe amplification step. the assays also tested an internal positive control added to each specimen at the extraction stage. adenovirus [17], coronavirus (types NL63, HKU-1, OC43, 229E) [18], cytomegalovirus (CMV) [19], enterovirus [22], influenza A virus [23], RSV-A [22], rhinovirus [24] and Legionella pneumophila[25]. a 89 bp fragment of the bacteriophage lambda (position 2402 to 2491, accession number J0245 DNA amplification of CMV, adenovirus and enterovirus was carried out in 0.2 ml tubes containing 45 l reaction mix and 5 l DNA extract. reaction mix consisted of 10 Taq buffer (including 50 mM Mg), 400 nM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 500 nM of target primers, 300 nM of the target probe, 300 nM of IC primers, 100 nM of the IC the real-time PCR for hMPV, PIV-1, -2 and 3 was performed using lightMix assays (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany) the cut-off value for the decision positive/negative was adjusted to 40 cycles. the reproducibility of the assay was demonstrated by analyzing the inter-assay variation for the crossing threshold (CT) values. the residual material was used for the comparative analysis with the RespiFinder-19 and RVP assay. the results of the performance evaluation were received retrospectively and had no influence on patient's therapy. an ethical approval is not required for clinical specimens without a separate invasive sampling. adenovirus (4.63E + 05 copies/ml), rhinovirus (3.68E + 05 copies/ml), hMPV (2.31E + 05 copies/ml), PIV-1 (2.09E + 05 copies/ml), PIV-2 (1.19E + 05 copies/ml) and PIV-3 (4.99E + 05 copies/ml) for the undiluted samples, 22 l of each virus were mixed (total volume: 286 nucleic acid extraction The total nucleic acid from inoculated samples and tracheal secretion samples (TS) was extracted using the NucliSENSeasyMAG automated system (bioM\u00e9rieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany) the manufacturer of the Respi-Finder-19 and SMART-22 assays recommend an elution volume of 100 l. adenovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, hMPV, influenza A virus, influenza A virus, PIV-1, -2, -3 and 4, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, picornavirus (enterovirus and rhinovirus) and human bocavirus. the bacteriophage MS2 was used as an internal control (IC) for reverse transcription PCR. RNA amplification of coronavirus (types NL63, HKU-1, OC43, 229E), influenza A virus, RSV-A and rhinovirus was carried out in 0.2 ml tubes containing 45 l reaction mix. PCR was performed on the RotorGene 3000 system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 15 min, preliminary denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing and extension at 65\u00b0C for 45 s. the reaction mix consisted of 10 Taq buffer (including 50 mM Mg), 400 nM of each deoxynucleo mix consisted of 5 FastStart DNA Master Plus Hybridization Probes. 200 nM of each target primer, 150 nM of the target probe, 300 nM of each IC probe and 0.01 U of UNG. real-time PCR was performed on the lightCycler 2.0 system.

RSV-A and AdV were detected by the RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22 assays at concentrations ranging from 104 copies/ml (panel 1) to 102 copies/ml (RSV panel 2, AdV panel 3). the RVP assay now detects AdV (104 copies/ml panel 1, 103 copies/ml panel 3) and PIV-2 (104 copies/ml, panel 2). the detection frequency of RSV-A virus was reduced for both RespiFinder assays analysing samples with 100 l elution volume compared to 55 l elution volume. no differences in the detection frequency were found for the RVP assay (Table 3). panel 2* 55 l elution 55 l elution 55 l elution 55 l elution 55 l elution 55 l elution (INF-A H1/ INF-A H3/ RSV-A/ PIV-2) + / + / + / + / + / + / + / + / - / - / - / - / / + / + respiratory viruses were detected by RespiFinder-19 in 32 TS samples from winter (64%). most frequent viruses were AdV, which was found in 16 TS samples. the RVP detected respiratory viruses only in 11 TS samples (22%) in summer fewer respiratory virus infections were found in the TS samples. fewer respiratory virus infections were found in the TS samples by the different assays. the samples contained CMV (detection only with monoplex real-time) in order to exclude CMV pneumonia due to reactivation processes, samples had already been tested for CMV in line with our standard diagnostic profile. hMPV hMPV 20 m 65 PIV-3 PIV-3 21 m 73 - AdV AdV 22 m 70 - AdV AdV 23 m 79 - PIV-2 PIV-2 24 f 62 - AdV AdV 25 f 72 HRV HRV HRV 26 f 82 HRV HRV HRV 27 m 80 - AdV AdV 28 m 71 CoV 229E n.d. 29 m 64 the highest detection rate of 43 viruses was reached with the RespiFinder-19. a confirmation reaction was performed with monoplex PCR assay. the viruses which were only detected with RespiFinder-19 showed high cycle threshold points in monoplex PCR methods due to low virus concentrations. bocavirus - bocavirus - B. pertussis - C. pneumoniae Sample volume 500 L 200 L 200 L Elution volume 55 L 100 L 100 L 100 L PCR volume 10 L 10 L 10 L Principle of detection fluorescence bead array capillary electrophoresis melt curve analysis PERFORMANCE Hands-on-time 0.80 h 1.75 h 1.25 h Time-to-result 3.5 h 7.5 h 6.0 the parallel analysis with monoplex real-time PCR assays showed as expected the highest analytical sensitivity. all viruses were detected in all concentrations and dilution factors. 13 viruses in one sample was the maximum demand on multiplex PCR tests. no differences were found in the detection with the RVP assay. the remaining extract is available for retesting or analysis for non-included pathogens. the analysis of 100 TS samples was done in parallel with the RVP and the RespiFinder-19. ekers\u2019 study, respiratory viruses were detected by RVP in 31 of 95 clinical samples and by RespiFinder-19 in 75 of 95. these results are comparable to our results and verified our results in present study. the older assay was more sensitive than the newer RVP Fast assay (88.6% and 77.5% sensitivities, respectively) the interpretation of the generated data of the three assays has different levels of difficulty. Abbott Molecular supplies with the RVP a software tool (TDAS RVP FAST software), which analyzes the generated data and provides automatically a positive or negative signal. the further developed RespiFinder-SMART-22, has an improved analysis of the generated data with given melting points. multiplex PCR methods allow a fast and exact identification of the causative pathogens. for routine application the analytical sensitivity must balance out the time-to-result, hands-on-time and the clinical relevance of the detected pathogens. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the results of our analysis of 100 TS samples were registered with the network of respiratory viruses (http://www.medical-dpc.com/respvir). this network was founded for the acquisition, documentation and statistical analysis of epidemiological data from respiratory tract infections caused by viruses."}
