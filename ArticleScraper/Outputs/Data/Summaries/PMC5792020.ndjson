{"summary": "Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is a causative agent of the genus. it may affect both humans and animals, mainly ruminants, but also camels. in livestock RVF causes large number of abortions (abortion storms) RVF is considered to be endemic in sub-saharan africa countries (including Sudan), with major outbreaks associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding. a consequence of all those changes would be an increase of the risk of introduction of RVFV into areas of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East [3] study aims to understand the structure and patterns of the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt. it aims to evaluate the risk of RVFV transmission within Egypt. improvement of RVFV surveillance should allow early detection of disease. the DE-MALRE provided information on the characteristics of the 273 animal markets present in Egypt. the ranking was initially developed for Foot and Mouth disease, but was adapted for RVF as follows: Characterization of animal markets. animal markets which trade sheep and goats are located in the governorates bordering Sudan were given a score of 2, while the others were given a score of 0. a 3 point score was assigned to the two main camel markets according to the opinion of the EVS. maps were obtained from the FAO-Gridded Livestock of the World modelled data. densities were calculated and maps were rasterized. all animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year. the distribution of Cx. pipiens Culex pipiens has been traditionally considered the main vector of RVFV in Egypt [16]. other species potentially involved in RVFV transmission is Cx. antennatus, considered by Gad and collaborators. the corresponding categories from FAO-GeoNetwork land cover were extrapolated from the south of Europe, and used to map the distribution areas of Cx. pipiens in Egypt. if a FAO-GeoNetwork land cover category corresponded to more than one Corine land cover category, its value for the presence of Cx. pipiens was that of Corine land cover category (0 or 1). monthly vector distribution maps were created using the monthly estimates of the SD of the EVI for the year 2015. the estimates of Cx. pipiens distribution for the different months, as well as the average value for the year, were obtained. the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was assumed to be proportional to the density of animals up to a certain level, above which risk was assumed to remain constant. the relationship between density and risk was described with a monotonically increasing membership function shape. the upper density limit was set at the percentile 99 of the density. transmission as consequence of those changes was measured at 10,000 random locations. a linear regression model was fitted to the data. the contribution of each factor to the variation of the risk of RVFV transmission was calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares related to that factor on the total sum of squares. studies on the dispersal of Cx. pipiens in urban habitats found maximum flight ranges of 1.98 km [29] and 2.48 km [30] after quarantine, imported camels may be taken to markets or slaughterhouses. the risk of RVF transmission is determined by the probability of the virus being introduced into that area. data on the location of slaughterhouses and animal markets was provided by the department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of Egypt. the de-MALRE also provided information on the characteristics of the 273 animal markets present in Egypt. this ranking was initially developed for Foot and Mouth disease, but was adapted for RVF as follows. inquires carried out by the Egyptian Veterinary Services revealed some illegal trade of sheep and goats occurs through the border between Sudan and Egypt. animal markets which trade sheep and goats were given a score of 2, while the others were given a score of 0. all cattle and camels imported into Egypt are quarantined. data on the quarantine facilities in which the imported lots of animals are slaughtered. camels, once released from the quarantines, may be sent to slaughterhouses or to animal markets. a score of 4 was given to markets with camels plus other susceptible species, 3 to markets exclusively for camels, 2 to markets with 2 or more susceptible species. the scores were: 1 if the market opened a single day per week, 2 if the market opened 2\u20133 days per week. all layers were transformed into a raster format, with 1 km 1 km spatial resolution and the common UTM 35N projection. mapping the distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV Cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels were considered as the species susceptible for RVFV. mapping the distribution of Cx. pipiens Culex pipiens has been traditionally considered the main vector of RVFV in Egypt [16], and recent entomological studies seem to confirm that [17]. Cx. antennatus was the most abundant species in Kafr el Sheikh governorate in the 2003 epidemic. its primary breeding areas coincide with those of Cx. pipiens. the corresponding categories from FAO-GeoNetwork land cover were extrapolated from the south of Europe. the map of Cx. pipiens presence based on land cover, the map of human population and the maps of SD of the EVI were all standardized and combined to produce the map of the overall vector suitability. each month, the variability in the distribution of Cx. pipiens was evaluated in the areas around the quarantine premises, the main markets and the camel slaughterhouses. standardized maps of the distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV and of competent vectors of RVFV were combined to produce a map of the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. the relationship between density and risk was described with a monotonically increasing membership function shape, and a linear membership function type. a sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of a change in the weights applied to each of the risk factors on the risk of RVFV transmission. a linear regression model was fitted to the data, and the contribution of each factor to the variation of the risk of RVFV transmission was calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares related to that factor. in 2012, an outbreak of RVF in cattle was reported by the FAO in the village of al Khwajat. in total, 16 outbreak locations were used for the validation of the risk map. the data was obtained from the FAO-Gridded Livestock of the World modelled data. mapping the distribution of Cx. pipiens Culex pipiens has been traditionally considered the main vector of RVFV in Egypt [16], and recent entomological studies seem to confirm that [17]. the competence of Egyptian Cx. pipiens for RVFV transmission was demonstrated experimentally [18]. the corresponding categories from FAO-GeoNetwork land cover were extrapolated from the south of Europe. if a FAO-GeoNetwork land cover category corresponded to more than one Corine land cover category, its value for the presence of Cx. pipiens was that of Corine land cover category (0 or 1). a recent study modelling the distribution of Cx. pipiens in arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. the map of Cx. pipiens presence based on land cover, the map of human population and the maps of SD of the EVI were all standardized and combined to produce the map of the overall vector suitability. each month, the variability in Cx. pipiens favorability (i.e. suitability) was calculated as: V a r i, j = a b s s. Favi,j represents Cx. pipiens favorability in month i and location j. Vari,j is obtained as an absolute value. sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of a change in the weights applied to each of the risk factors on the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. a linear regression model was fitted to the data, and the contribution of each factor to the variation of the risk of RVFV transmission was calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares related to that factor. for the 1977 epidemic data on the location of several outbreaks which affected humans and animals were reported by Meegan. an outbreak of RVF in cattle was reported by the FAO in the village of al Khwajat. in total, 16 outbreak locations were used for the validation of the risk map. the actual risk of RVF occurring in that area is determined by the probability of the virus being introduced into that area. importations increased to about 15,000 in 2014 and 18,000 in 2015. no seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported into Egypt. 139,664 camels imported into Egypt between 2012 and 2015. importations were about 29% higher than the average for the year. all the cattle imported from Sudan arrived via Djibouti. all the cattle imported from Ethiopia in 2015 arrived via Djibouti. all imported camels have to be killed in the slaughterhouses. 21% 38% Species traded One species Two or more species Camels Camels & other species 10% 71% 2% 17% Operating days per week 1 day 2\u20133 days > 3 days 97% 3% 1% Potential presence of smuggled animals Yes 6% The majority of markets to the south of Cairo are local markets (that only trade animals from the same district) only 17 of the 273 markets were located in the governorates bordering Sudan (16 in Aswan and 1 in the New Valley) of the 5530 cows imported from Ethiopia in 2015, 1945 were slaughtered in Adabiya quarantine, and the remaining 3385 in Sahl Hasheesh quarantine. measures to prevent the introduction of rvfv into Egypt Camels. on arrival they receive one dose of vaccine against RVFV. in 2015, the year we used to account for the vaccine coverage in our model, 7.3 million doses of vaccine were administered as compared to 5.9 million in 2014. the analysis of the vaccine coverage data evidences a great degree of heterogeneity in the vaccination among species and areas. the standardized distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV (all species) shows a pattern which is mainly coincident with the areas surrounding the Nile river. the vector map produced will be a proxy of the potential risk of RVFV transmission from mosquitos to humans (zoonotic risk) the maximum variability was found in markets (0.15) and camel slaughterhouses (0.12). the maximum variability in quarantines was only 0.05. the remaining host species (cattle, sheep, buffaloes and camels) were not significantly associated with the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. the risk obtained at the location of outbreaks varied between 0.18 and 0.85, with a mean value of 0.49. large blue circles represent the three slaughterhouses that kill the most camels. the summary estimates of the risks of RVFV transmission by vectors at those main locations after the importation of animals. aswan had a risk of RVFV transmission by vectors relatively low. Birqash market had risk of RVFV transmission by vectors quite high. of the remaining high-risk markets there are 10 with risk of RVFV transmission by vectors estimates above 0.7. importations progressively increased to about 15,000 in 2014 and 18,000 in 2015. that increase coincided with the intensification of the trade with Sudan. no seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported into Egypt. increase coincided with the intensification of the trade with Sudan and the decrease of the trade with Ethiopia. all the cattle imported from Sudan in 2015 arrived from Sudan to Abu Simbel quarantine. all imported camels have to be killed in the slaughterhouses within the quarantine premises. governorate Different governorates 41% 21% 38% Species traded One species Two or

south of Cairo are local markets (that only trade animals from the same district) only 17 of the 273 markets were located in the governorates bordering Sudan (16 in Aswan and 1 in the camels from Sudan are quarantined in Abu Simbel or shelateen facilities. on arrival they receive one dose of vaccine against RVFV. they are maintained in quarantine for 3 days, after which they are transported to animal markets or to slaughterhouses. buffaloes and camels are meant to be vaccinated twice a year with RVF inactivated vaccine (Zagazig H501 strain) in 2015, the year we used to account for the vaccine coverage in our model, 7.3 million doses of vaccine were administered compared to 5.9 million in 2014. no seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported into Egypt. 139,664 camels imported in 2015 arrived from western Sudan to Abu Simbel quarantine in south-central Egypt. another 50,688 (23% of the total) arrived from Eastern Sudan to Shalateen quarantine in south-eastern Egypt. importations were about 29% higher than the average for the year. all the cattle imported in 2015 from Sudan arrived via Djibouti. all the cattle imported from Ethiopia in 2015 arrived via Djibouti. all imported cattle arrived via Djibouti. markets that trade camels are located all along the Nile river basin. only 17 of the 273 markets were located in the governorates bordering Sudan. the RVFV risk-ranking of animal markets varied between 5 and 16. camels from Sudan are quarantined in Abu Simbel or Shelateen facilities. on arrival they receive one dose of vaccine against RVFV. they are maintained in quarantine for 3 days, after which they are transported to animal markets or to slaughterhouses. 7.3 million doses of vaccine were administered in 2015 compared to 5.9 million in 2014. cattle had the highest level of vaccine coverage with about 60%. cattle had the highest level of vaccine coverage with about 30%. the standardized distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV (all species) shows a pattern which is mainly coincident with the areas surrounding the Nile river. the vector map produced will be a proxy of the potential risk of RVFV transmission from mosquitos to humans (zoonotic risk) the maximum variability was found in markets (0.15) and camel slaughterhouses (0.12). the maximum variability in quarantines was only 0.05. host species (cattle, sheep, buffaloes and camels) were not significantly associated with the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. the location of RVFV-positive cases in humans and animals was used to validate the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors map. the standardized distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV (all species) shows a pattern which is mainly coincident with the areas surrounding the Nile river. the vector map produced will be a proxy of the potential risk of RVFV transmission from mosquitos to humans. the maximum variability was found in markets (0.15) and camel slaughterhouses (0.12), while the maximum variability in quarantines was only 0.05. mean and maximum variability in 10,000 random points (in the areas where risk is not zero) the remaining host species (cattle, sheep, buffaloes and camels) were not significantly associated with the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. the risk obtained at the location of outbreaks varied between 0.18 and 0.85, with a mean value of 0.49. large blue circles represent the three slaughterhouses that kill the most camels. the summary estimates of the risks of RVFV transmission by vectors at those main locations after the importation of animals. aswan had a risk of RVFV transmission by vectors relatively low (between 0.15 and 0.16) Birqash market had risk of RVFV transmission by vectors quite high (between 0.70 and 0.74) of the remaining high-risk markets there are 10 with risk of RVFV transmission by vectors estimates above 0.7. the role of camels in the epidemiology of RVFV remains unclear. it has been suggested that camels may be essential for RVFV transmission in some ecosystems where their density is high. in 2014\u20132015, 9.6% of camels in Khartoum State (Sudan) had RVFV antibodies, including at least one positive born after the last reported epidemic. camels may be involved in the introduction of other diseases such as MERS-CoV. the human population in Egypt is expected to continue growing at a rate of almost 2% per year in the following decade. the human population in Egypt is expected to continue growing at a rate of almost 2% per year in the following decade. ruminants and camels in the country only grew a 3.2% [42] 2% of markets traded exclusively camels, and 17% further traded camels. most of the markets are located in the areas beside the Nile river and its delta. smuggling of small ruminants was considered more likely. ls from Sudan need to walk to reach the Egyptian border would be enough to prevent the importation of infected animals. some of the camels are currently transported on trucks rather than on foot. transmission (either direct or indirect) during the transport of camels cannot be ruled out. despite the increase in vaccine doses administered in 2015, the level of vaccine coverage would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country. failures in the local application of vaccination programs were identified as one of the causes of previous epidemics of RVFV in Egypt. transmission via mosquitos is considered the most important mode of transmission during the enzootic cycle. the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the suitable areas of Egypt seem to be more or less constant throughout the year. in some specific locations there may be significant variations in Cx. pipiens density. the distribution of Cx. pipiens was the most determinant factor in the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. the only other statistically significant parameter was the density of susceptible goats. the area with the highest density of goats coincided with very low levels of vaccine coverage (7% and 14%, respectively) the establishment of some active (sentinel) surveillance in the locations identified as having the highest risk would be essential. the slaughtering of animals poses an important risk for humans by exposure to body fluids or tissues of infected animals. infectivity of blood during the acute phase of infection in mammals is high. humans infected by RVFV may develop a viremia sufficient to infect nave mosquitoes [50], others consider humans as dead-end hosts [3] wind-borne transportation of infected mosquitoes has been proposed."}
