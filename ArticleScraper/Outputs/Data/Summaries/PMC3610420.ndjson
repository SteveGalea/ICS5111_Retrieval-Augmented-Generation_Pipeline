{"summary": "METHODS Study Population This prospective cohort study consists of HIV-infected adult men and women initiating ART enrolled in a trial of vitamins B-complex, C, and E at high levels versus standard levels of the recommended dietary allowance conducted in the HIV care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. the primary outcome of the trial was HIV disease progression or death, and there was no difference between treatment arms. a structured interview was completed to collect information on demographic characteristics. study physicians performed a clinical examination and assessed HIV disease stage. pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed if at least 1 of the 3 sputum smears had acid-fast bacilli. if chest radiography showed radiological features consistent with tuberculosis in the absence of a positive sputum smear result [19], the diagnosis was based on known specific or constitutional features. wasting was defined as a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) effect modification was assessed with the likelihood ratio test. proportional hazard models were used to investigate relationship between hypoalbuminemia at baseline and death, the incidence of WHO HIV stage IV disease or death, and the first occurrence of morbidity and nutritional outcomes. associations between serum albumin concentration at ART initiation and CD4+ T-cell counts were analyzed with generalized estimating equations. change in CD4+ T-cell count between consecutive visits was treated as a longitudinal continuous outcome. baseline covariates (excluding baseline CD4+ T-cell count) were treated as explanatory variables. vitamin regimen, and ART regimen were considered for all analyses. statistical analyses were performed using SAS v 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) a P value of.05 was considered statistically significant. drug combinations included stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), zidovudine (AZT) and efavirenz (EFV) patients who could not tolerate d4T were substituted for d4T. treatment for all opportunistic infection was provided according to the national and WHO guidelines. chronic diarrhea defined as report of diarrheal symptoms for 14 days. pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed if at least 1 of the 3 sputum smears had acid-fast bacilli detected by Ziehl-Neelsen staining techniques or if chest radiography showed radiological features consistent with tuberculosis. baseline hypoalbuminemia was defined as a serum albumin concentration of 35 g/L for both sexes [22]. Statistical Methods Baseline hypoalbuminemia was defined as a serum albumin concentration of 35 g/L. individuals without events were censored at the date of last follow-up. the results are reported as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. the robust score test was used to determine whether the categorical serum albumin concentration groups differed in CD4+ T-cell count trajectory. baseline CD4+ T cell count was not adjusted for in CD4+ T-cell analyses because this would have yield biased estimates. a total of 858 individuals (39.5%) had hypoalbuminemia at baseline. baseline hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with older age (P =.033), decreasing BMI (P.001), more severe WHO HIV disease stage (P.001), decreasing hemoglobin level (P.001) and an ALT level of >40 IU/L (P =.003) at baseline study visit. 001a 1.56 (1.38\u20131.77).001a 16.0\u201318.5 179 (14.9) 250 (27.0) 1.47 (1.33\u20131.64) 1.30 (1.17\u20131.44) 18.5\u201325 741 (61.5) 484 (52.4) 1.0 1.0 >25.0 257 (21.3) 85 (9.2).79 (.38\u20131.64).78 (.64\u2013.94) WHO HIV disease stage I/II 360 (26.3) 120 (14.0) 1.0.001a 1.0 ART regimenb d4T, 3TC, NVP 695 (57.7) 575 (61.8) d4T, 3TC, EFV 96 (7.9) 107 (11.5)......
