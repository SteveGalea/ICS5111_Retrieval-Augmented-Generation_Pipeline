{"summary": "unexplained fever represents as one of the most common and difficult diagnostic problems encountered daily by clinicians. FUO was defined as a fever of 38.3\u00b0C lasting for 3 weeks with undiagnosed etiology even after 1 week of intensive hospital testing. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, giant cell/temporal arteritis, adult Still disease, periarteritis nodosa, and microscopic polyangiitis account for another one-third of FUOs. FUOs due to neoplasms and malignancies account for 18% of all FUOs; of them, renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma are the most a final diagnosis can be established in only 49% of patients with recurrent FUO. the etiologies of fever may be approached in terms of their height, fever pattern, and duration. the longer the FUO remains undiagnosed, the more likely it is to have a noninfectious etiology. the national health insurance (NHI) program covers 99% of the population of Taiwan. national health care expenditure in Taiwan increased from 5.3% in 1995 to 6.0% in 2001 of the gross national product. systemic sampling CD and DD files 0.2% of the ambulatory care expenditures, by visit, CD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. 5% of the inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. a total of one million cases of systemic sampling dataset were used in this study. a score of 3 was added when the subjects had co-morbid moderate or severe liver disease. a score of 6 was added when the subjects had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. the total score was obtained by adding the relative weight of all comorbidities. there are three accreditation hospital levels in Taiwan: medical centers, regional hospitals, and local hospitals. the independent variables evaluated included pre-post GB, age, gender, income state index, Charlson comorbidity index, the three hospital levels. a score of 1 was added when the subjects had co-morbid myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, peptic ulcer disease, mild liver disease, or diabetes without end-organ damage. a score of 3 was added when the subjects had co-morbid metastatic solid tumors or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. the NHRI is a nonprofit foundation established by the government. the t test was used to compare the differences in mean values. there were two nested levels in this study. there were no significant differences in age, male to female ratio, or income state index before and after GB (P =.06, P =.20, P =.89) however, there was a significant difference in Charlson comorbidity index before and after GB (P =.04) LOS did not differ significantly between patients treated at medical centers and those treated at local hospitals. LOS did not differ significantly between patients treated at medical centers and those treated at local hospitals. diagnostic costs A generalized linear model was used for analysis. because diagnostic costs were skewed to the right, data were converted to log base 10 for statistical analysis. GB system had a significantly positive impact on diagnostic costs. there were no significant differences in drug costs between regional hospitals and medical centers or local hospitals and medical centers. there were no significant differences in drug costs between hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. compared with hospitals in Taipei city, there were no significant differences in therapy costs among hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. there were no significant differences in total costs between regional hospitals and medical centers or local hospitals and medical centers ( = 0.01, P =.90; = 0.53, P =.42, respectively) GB did not have a significant impact on the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days (OR = 0.58; P =.25). there were no significant correlation between age, gender, income state index or Charlson comorbidity index. no significant differences in the risk of readmission within 14 days were noted between regional hospitals and medical centers or between local hospitals and medical centers. compared with hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. compared with hospitals in Taipei city, there was no significant difference in LOS among hospitals located in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. there was no significant difference in LOS among hospitals located in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. therapy costs A generalized linear model was used for analysis. because drug costs were skewed to the right, data were converted to log base 10 for statistical analysis. GB had a significantly negative impact on drug costs ( = 0.25, P =.002) there was a significantly positive correlation between age and drug costs ( = 0.01, P =.003) there were no significant differences in therapy costs between regional hospitals and medical centers or local hospitals and medical centers. there were no significant differences in therapy costs between hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. GB did not have a significant impact on the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days. there was no significant correlation between age, gender, income state index and the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days. GB did not have a significant impact on the risk of being readmitted within 14 days. there were no significant correlations between age, gender, income state index, or Charlson comorbidity index and the risk of readmission within 14 days. s. GB did not significantly affect LOS in patients with unexplained fever. FUO is diagnosed less frequently in adults than in children. adult patients are more likely to be admitted and have longer LOSs. the major drawbacks are cost and accessibility; FDG-PET/CT costed \u00a3800, compared with \u00a3250 for a chest\u2013abdomen\u2013pelvis CT. however, this could be offset by earlier definitive treatment due to higher diagnostic sensitivity. the risks of revisiting the ED within 3 days and readmission within 14 days significantly decreased after implementation of the GB system. none of the tested variables were independent predictors of revisiting the ED within 3 days or being readmitted within 14 days for patients with unexplained fever. a possible reason this observation are the regulations for evaluating the quality of care in hospitals in Taiwan. GB significantly increased LOS and incremental diagnostic, therapeutic, and total costs; however, the quality of care improved for patients with unexplained fever."}
