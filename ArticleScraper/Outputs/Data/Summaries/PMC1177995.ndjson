{"summary": "newly synthesized envelope proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus. initial folding and processing is required to achieve a conformation. the multimeric envelope proteins are poised to undergo structural rearrangement leading to fusion of the virion and the new target cell lipid bilayer membranes. a peptide from one of the two extended helical domains of the HIV-1 transmembrane protein can block virion infectivity. the FDA approved anti-HIV-1 drug FuzeonTM (aka DP178, T-20, enfuvirtide) and other inhibitory peptides were developed. additional peptide mimics of the fusion proteins of other retroviruses, and of orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, the flaviviruses, which include DENV, west Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and TBEV, among others, are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by insect vectors. there are four serotypes of DENV (1\u20134), which together cause an estimated 50 million human infections per year. Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale predicts regions of the DENV and WNV E proteins that may play roles in protein-protein rearrangements or bilayer membrane interactions. regions with high WWIHS scores are predicted to play a role in protein-protein interactions during structural rearrangements. regions with significant Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale scores were predicted with MPeX. initial set of synthetic peptides representing sequences of DENV E and WNV E with significant WWIHS scores was synthesized and screened. significant WWIHS scores, including domain II (WN53 and WN83), and stem domain (DN59), were found to have inhibitory activity. initial peptides synthesized and tested for inhibitory activity. the WN53 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against WNV of 56.0 +/- 3.0% (mean +/- SD) at 99 M. the inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of 10 M. the inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of 10 M. cross-inhibition of WNV fusion/infectivity (>99% inhibition at 25 M) was also reproducibly demonstrated. however, WNV inhibitory peptide WN83 did not inhibit infectivity by DENV. Figure 6. Inhibitory effect of peptides WN53 and DN59 alone and in combination. peptides DN59, WN83 and WN53 at 100 g/ml concentrations tested for inhibitory activity against the alphavirus SINV in a similar plaque reduction assay. none of the peptides showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect against SINV. peptides that block entry at different steps may produce greater inhibition of DENV-2 infectivity than either peptide alone. synergistic or antagonistic effects are also possible, if a peptide that alters protein-protein interactions allows greater or lesser access to E domains. regions with high WWIHS scores are predicted to play a role in protein-protein interactions during structural rearrangements or protein-lipid interactions during bilayer fusion. we predicted synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions may have the potential to inhibit flavivirus infectivity. peptides were used to infect monolayers of LLCKM-2 monkey kidney epithelial cells. the number of resulting viral foci was determined from three experiments. initial peptides synthesized and tested for inhibitory activity. preincubation of DENV with neutralizing antiserum reduces plaque number by 74%. determination of 50% inhibitory concentrations Dose-response curves were determined for the most potent of the peptides WN53 and WN83 against WNV. Increasing concentrations of peptide WN53 produce a corresponding increase in WNV inhibition with an IC50 in the 10 M range. all measurements were made in triplicate, with mean +/- SD shown. Specificity of peptide inhibitory activity The DN59 peptide matches a pre-anchor domain sequence that is highly conserved among insect-transmitted flaviviruses. neither scrambled peptide significantly inhibited infection by these viruses. results provide evidence that the action of these inhibitory peptides not due to general inactivation of enveloped virions and is sequence specific. peptides WN83, WN83, and DN59 all inhibited WNV entry. peptide combination was more effective than WN53 alone, but less effective than DN59 alone. no statistical difference was observed between viability of control cells. the inhibitory effects of these peptides were dose dependent with IC50s in the range of 10 M. none of the inhibitory peptides induced gross cytopathic effects, killing of cultured cells or showed evidence of in vitro toxicity. two inhibitory peptides (WN53 and WN83) are designed from overlapping regions of the E protein domain I/II junction and are specifically inhibitory against WNV. the possibility that WN53, WN83 and DN59 interact with some target cell surface component to exert their inhibitory effects cannot be ruled out. the majority of flavivirus neutralizing antibodies that appear to be involved in receptor blocking bind to domain III. the DN59 peptide is inhibitory against DENV as well as WNV. the pre-anchor region is highly conserved between DENV and WNV. DN59 or similar peptides may act as broad-spectrum flavivirus inhibitors.

IC50s in the M range have been considered promising for class I viral fusion protein inhibitor development. the development of resistant mutants will be a concern, but should be a less problematic than in the case of persistent retroviral infections. the fact that we developed these peptides using a predictive strategy validates our approach as well as the accuracy of the flavivirus E protein structural data. Sindbis virus containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein expression cassette was obtained from K.
