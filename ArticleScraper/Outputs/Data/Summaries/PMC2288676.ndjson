{"summary": "IL-32 level was increased by 58.2% in serum samples from 108 patients infected by influenza A virus compared to that of 115 healthy individuals. expression of IL-32 in influenza A virus infected A549 human lung epithelial cells was blocked by selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or Aspirin, a known anti-inflammatory drug. IL-32 is induced by influenza A virus infection via COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. prominent sources of dsRNA include viral RNAs containing double-stranded secondary structure and dsRNA formed during viral replication. dsRNA treatment was always used to mimic the viral infection in cell lines [5], [6], [7] in macrophages, dsRNA and viral infection stimulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 [1], [8 interleukin-32 (IL-32), previously called natural killer cell transcript 4, has been recognized as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. it is expressed in natural killer cells, T cells, epithelial cells and blood monocytes. it plays an important role in innate immunity, synergism between IL-32 and other well-characterized players in innate immunity has recently been documented. influenza A virus infection or poly(IC) treatment activates COX-2 and IL-32 expression by a heretofore unrecognized mechanism. IL-32 feedback inhibits COX-2 expression by a heretofore unrecognized mechanism. IL-32 promoter (746/+25) was amplified from human genomic DNA by RT-PCR. PCR product was cloned into ecoRI and XhoI sites of pCMV-tag2A. all of the ten genes of influenza A virus H5N1 were obtained by RT-PCR from pCMV-Flag2A.

ELISA for IL-32 measurement ELISA assays were developed using IL-32 antibody and a polypeptide. ELISAs were prepared by coating the bottom of a 96-well plate with diluted serum samples or culture media. 50 l of 2 g/ml capture antibody was incubated for one hour then washed three times with TBST, followed by HRP-labeled secondary antibody incubation for 15 minutes. stock virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 36 to 48 h at 37\u00b0C. the allantoic fluid was then harvested, and aliquots were stored at \u201380\u00b0C. the final concentration of H5N1 virus infection used in this study was 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) all of the ten genes of influenza A virus H5N1 were obtained by RT-PCR from H5N1 infected A549 cells. they were constructed into pCMV-Flag2A vector to generate IV-gene expressing plasmids (flag2A-HA, Flag2A-NA, Flag2A-NP, Flag2A-NS1 Flag2A-NS2, Flag2A-M1, Flag2A-M2, Flag2A-PA, Flag monoclonal mouse antibody against human IL-32 was purchased from cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) polyclonal goat antibody specific for human -actin (SC-1616) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) aspirin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid poly(IC) and recombinant human interferon- (IFN-) were dissolved in PBS and used at a final concentration of 5 mM, 50 g/ml, 150 U/ml. cell culture HEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (GibcoBRL, USA), human assays were performed in triplicate and expressed as meanss.d. relative to vector or mock control as 100 (RLU) or luciferase activity (LUC) Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) PCR was performed in 25 l reactions with the detection primer pairs described as follows. ELISA for IL-32 measurement ELISAs were developed using IL-32 antibody. a polypeptide was synthesized as an antigen for making an IL-32 protein standard curve. ELISAs were prepared by coating the bottom of a 96-well plate with diluted serum samples or culture media. IL-32, 183.843.6 vs. 116.229.3 pg/ml, respectively, as described in Table 1. Demographic and baseline characteristics, serum levels of PGE2 and IL-32 from influenza A positive patients. dsRNA can induce the production of COX-2, followed by PGE2 release. 549 cells were infected with influenza A virus or treated with poly(IC)+IFN- (150 U/ml) treatment. cytopathic effect was observed after viral infection. culture supernatants and cell lysates harvested at different time points. the gel or blot is a representative of three experiments with similar results. we screened all ten proteins of influenza virus: HA, NA, NP, NS1, NS2, M1, M2, PA, PB1, PB2 and poly(IC) to mimic viral replicative intermediate dsRNA. g/ml+IFN- (150 U/ml) into A549 cells. results are expressed as the means.d. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and normalized by Renilla activities. RT-PCR for IL-32 and -actin (internal control) (B) in cell lysates, Elisa for IL-32 (C) in culture supernatants were performed. IL-32 and -actin mRNA level were examined by RT-PCR. IL-32 accumulation in culture supernatants stimulated by poly(IC)+IFN- were suppressed by 80 M NS398. data suggest that COX-2 is an upstream regulatory factor of dsRNA-triggered IL-32 production. IL-32 feedback inhibits dsRNA-induced COX-2 expression. IL-32-specific siRNA was cotransfected with poly(IC)+IFN- (150 U/ml) for 48 h. time-dependent release in culture supernatants was measured. data represent means.d. of three separate experiments. influenza A-induced PGE2 production and IL-32 expression were inhibited by either NS398 or Aspirin. IL-32 production in culture supernatants were inhibited by selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398, or non-selective COX inhibitor Aspirin. a novel inflammatory pathway in response to influenza A virus infection and dsRNA treatment was identified. serum levels of PGE2 and IL-32 were significantly higher in the cohort of patients with influenza A virus infection investigated in comparison with healthy control individuals. 0 (0) 108 (100) 0.001 Viral genotype A (H3/H1)-no. 0 108 (85/23) PGE2-pg/ml 299.545.4 808.752.9 0.001 IL-32-pg/ml 116.229.3 183.843.6 0.001 IL-32-pg/ml 116.229.3 183.843.6 0.001 COX-2 and IL-32 activation in response to influenza time-dependent of PGE2 (A) and IL-32 (B) accumulations in A549 culture supernatants are shown in response to influenza A virus infection (1 MOI) or poly(IC) (50 g/ml)+IFN- (150 U/ml) treatment. reporter plasmids pCOX-2-Luc (A), pIL-32-Luc (B) and pRL-TK were cotransfected along with all 10 viral gene constructs. results are expressed as the means.d. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. assay showed that the level of IL-32 promoter activity was increased by COX-2 over-expression and it was blocked by COX-2 inhibitor NS398 in a dose-dependent manner. reporter plasmid pIL-32-Luc (A) and pRL-TK were cotransfected along with pcDNA3.1-COX-2 or pcDNA3.1 into A549 cells. IL-32 production in culture supernatants was stimulated by COX-2 over-expression in a dose-dependent manner. IL-32 accumulation in culture supernatants stimulated by poly(IC)+IFN- were suppressed by 80 M NS398. IL-32 feedback inhibits dsRNA-induced COX-2 expression. pCOX-2-Luc and pRL-TK were cotransfected with flag2A-IL-32 or control vectors (Flag2A) into A549 cells. Luciferase activity was then measured 48 h post transfection. IL-32-specific siRNA was cotransfected with reporter plasmid pCOX-2-Luc into a549 cells and treated with poly(IC)+IFN-. IL-32 production in culture supernatants stimulated with poly(IC)+IFN- was enhanced by knocking down IL-32. IL-32 production in culture supernatants stimulated with poly(IC)+IFN-. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA-IL-32 or siRNA-control. IL-32 production (D) in culture supernatants was measured. IL-32 was induced by influenza virus infection through COX-2-dependent mechanism. nitric oxide synthase (NOS) upregulated IL-32 expression and IL-32 feedback inhibited COX-2 expression in influenza A virus infected a549 lung epithelial cells. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) selective for its inhibition are used clinically to treat inflammatory arthropathies. aspirin is one of the classic NSAIDs, and its anti-inflammatory activity is associated with cyclooxygenase inhibition directly or indirectly."}
