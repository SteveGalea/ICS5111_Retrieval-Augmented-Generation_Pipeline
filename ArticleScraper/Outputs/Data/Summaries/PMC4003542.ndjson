{"summary": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease with a poor prognosis. median survival of IPF patients from disease diagnosis to death is usually no more than 3 years 2. current therapies such as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anti-fibrotic methods showed no promising results to halt the progression of the disease. a traditional Chinese herbal abstraction, Tanshinone IIA, exerted significant protective effects on lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hypoxic hypertension 17, 18. in the present study, TIIA was shown to be effective on halting the development of PF, which may via the ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) axis. control animals were injected intratracheally with 50 l of sterile saline of 0.9%. rats were anesthetized and sternotomy surgery was performed. part of the right lungs were cut for next histological assays. immunohistochemical staining analyses Lung sections of 4-m were prepared and deparaffinized, rehydrated, and blocked by incubating in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. three independent pathologists undertook the histological examination and applied the scoring system in a blinded fashion. sates were obtained from rat lung tissue by RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Inc, Jiangsu, China) Equivalent amounts of protein (30 g) of each sample were separated by electrophoresis using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. the bands were then incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (ACE-2, TGF-) male Sprague-Dawley rats from the animal center of the Fourth Military Medical University were used for all the experiments. rats were randomly divided into control group, n=10, 2) BLM group, n=10, and 3) BLM+ TIIA group, n=10, total 3 groups. rats were anesthetized and sternotomy surgery was performed. a modified picrosirius procedure based on sirius red staining was performed 19, 20. the specimens were immersed in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for 5 min. they were then covered with 0.1% (w/v) sirius red F3B. clonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) the tissues were incubated with corresponding antibody for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. negative controls were performed using mouse serum as the primary antibody. the primers were checked and synthesized by Genescript Company (Nangjing, China) the primer pairs for TGF1 are GAAGACATGACCCTGCTGGTGA (forward chain) and CTGGTGCTCTCTGGGCTTGG (reverse chain) and ACE-2 are AATCGTAGGCTCTCTCTGGGCTTGG (reverse chain) the HE staining showed that intact and clear alveoli, normal interstitium, few inflammatory cells were observed in the lungs of control group at each time point. however, TIIA treatment prevented those changes in rat lungs of administered with BLM. BLM administration resulted in gradually exacerbated lung alveoli destruction, interstitium thickening, and fibroblasts diffusion in rat lungs. TIIA treatment significantly halted those changes after BLM administration at each time point. TIIA treatment greatly up-regulated expression of ACE-2 in rat lungs compared to those of control group at the endpoint of 28 days. ACE2 immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue of rats in different group at 28 days. TIIA treatment significantly reversed the lowered ACE-2 expression. however, TIIA treatment significantly augmented the expression of ACE-2 mRNA in rat lungs. ELISA assays verified that BLM administration contributed decrease of ANG-(1-7) level in rat lungs. but TIIA treatment reversed the decreased expression of ANG-(1-7) (P0.01, vs BLM group, Fig. 5B) the protein levels of TGF-1 were significantly elevated after BLM administration. but TIIA treatment greatly inhibited TGF-1 expression. TIIA treatment reversed the drop of weight and increase of lung coefficient of rats. the HE staining showed that intact and clear alveoli, normal interstitium, few inflammatory cells were observed in the lungs of control group at each time point. however, TIIA treatment prevented those changes in rat lungs of administered with BLM. BLM administration resulted in gradually exacerbated lung alveoli destruction, interstitium thickening, and fibroblasts diffusion in rat lungs. TIIA treatment significantly halted those changes in rat lungs after BLM administration at each time point. TIIA treatment greatly up-regulated expression of ACE-2 in rat lungs compared to those of control group at the endpoint of 28 days. ACE2 immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue of rats in different group at 28 days. the protein levels of ACE-2 were further verified by WB assays. TIIA treatment significantly reversed the lowered ACE-2 expression. however, TIIA treatment significantly augmented the expression of ACE-2 mRNA in rat lungs. ELISA assays verified that BLM administration contributed decrease of ANG-(1-7) level in rat lungs. but TIIA treatment reversed the decreased expression of ANG-(1-7) (P0.01, vs BLM group, Fig. 5B) the protein levels of TGF-1 were significantly elevated after BLM administration. however, TIIA treatment greatly inhibited TGF-1 expression. sis is characterized by exaggerated deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the lung 22. PF induced exacerbated proliferation of fibroblasts, connective tissue expansion, and alveolar destruction gradually lead to functional loss of lungs. PF has a low survival time after diagnosis and no effective therapies till today. ACE-2, a homologue of ACE, was identified in 2000. previous studies revealed that ACE-2 may negatively regulate the RAS. ACE-2 plays a negative regulatory role for severity of lung edema. pirfenidone exerts protective effects on patients with mild-to-severe and/or progressive IPF 39. the present study further explored the protective effects and mechanisms of TIIA on PF models of rat."}
