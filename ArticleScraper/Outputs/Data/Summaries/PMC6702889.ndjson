{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a zoonotic parasite that infects humans, domestic, and wild mammals. it is a significant, life-threatening disease with medical, veterinary, and economic importance worldwide. acquiring an effective vaccine to control the vital impact of toxoplasmosis in both humans and animals is urgently needed. potential use of epitope-based vaccine could help in developing sensitive diagnostic assays, potential vaccines, as well as effective therapeutic agents. epitope-based vaccine has suggested as a new potential candidates for acquiring a novel and effective T. gondii vaccine. effective immunization is expected to reduce the shedding of the oocyst and prevent the cyst formation. such vaccination would significantly reduce parasite transmission to intermediate hosts and definitely improve disease control. achieving effective vaccines against toxoplasmosis is a high priority and extremely important. mouse inoculated with mutant strain ts-4 induced protective immunity against lethal infection after a parasite challenge. injection of mice with killed tachyzoite lysate provided no protection, neither alone nor with an adjuvant [21]. despite vaccination strategies studied, no safe and protective vaccine exists for both humans and animals. the effect of 60Co-irradiated tachyzoites on the stimulation of protective immunity against the beverley strains of T. gondii was investigated. the vaccine induced partial resistance after infection challenge. however, the vaccine showed disadvantages, such as the need for refrigeration and high costs. the establishment of DNA vaccination strategies have opened a new perspective in the future of vaccine development [34,44] the ability of such vaccines to induce high humoral and cell-mediated immunity makes it a promising vaccination strategy against intracellular pathogens including Toxoplasma[15]. the concept of epitope vaccines relies on the prediction of immunodominant T and B cell epitopes that can elicit specific and protective immune response [51] the most critical requirements include the proper identification of both T and B cells epitopes, as well as the selection of a novel and powerful approach to deliver those epitopes. peptide vaccine has entered phases I and II with satisfactory clinical outcomes. however, more effort is needed to eliminate obstacles, including the necessity to have a better adjuvant, as well as the low or/and lack of resulting immunogenicity during antigen processing and presentation. however, other study showed a significant progress in defying these limitations. selection of immunogenic epitopes is crucial in designating any particular epitope-based vaccine. the differences in pathogens genotypes and subtypes should be taken into account. the differences in pathogens genotypes and subtypes should be taken into account. mice were immunized with a multi-epitope vaccine expressing nine epitopes predicted from GRA2, GRA1, and GRA4. a synthetic vaccine expressing nine epitopes has been used previously and confirmed to elicit strong immune responses. mice immunized with epitopes vaccine identified form ROP19 protein induced significant T and B cell immune response. effective systemic and mucosal immunity was enhanced with both single and mixed peptides with a strong lymphoproliferative response. partial immune protection against acute and chronic toxoplasmosis was also generated. the use of epitope-based antigens is promising in the development of potential vaccine candidates that would generate lasting protective immune reaction against T. gondii. the use of epitope-based antigens could be an important approach in investigating the improvement of the disease vaccination in the future."}
