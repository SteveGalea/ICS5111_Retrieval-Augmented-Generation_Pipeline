{"summary": "despite advances in the understanding of HIV-1 infection, major scientific mysteries remain. in most infections HIV-1 binds to a cell-surface receptor and co-receptors. as binding is not sufficient for entry, the HIV-1 and the host cell membrane fuse. the innate immune system is the first line of defence against invading pathogens. entry of HIV-1 into the host initiates immediate responses to control virus propagation. heme enzyme myeloperoxidase is the most abundant protein in neutrophils. myeloperoxidase/HOCl immune defence system pooled plasma proteins (Idea-PP) bind with high affinity to HIV-1 gp120, its receptor CD4 and to PDI. ELISA assays showed specific binding to gp120, CD4 as well as to the PDI. binding of non-modified original material to GP120 and CD4 was not significant. ding of either plasma proteins (PP) or altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) to purified HIV-1 gp120 (A), CD4 (B) or PDI (C) was determined by specific ELISA. mean extinction SD from three parallel samples is presented. fusion with human cells pooled plasma proteins (PP) were altered to Idea-PP using different molar ratios of protein to HOCl. ratios of 1300, 11000 and 12000 were used for the experiments to evaluate the optimal procedure. neither Idea-PP nor the control PP were toxic for the human cells in the used concentrations. HIV-1 infection of these cells transactivates the LTR promoter inducing -galactosidase production. all tested Idea-PP pools reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells in a dose dependent manner. however the antiviral effect was more prominent when Idea-PP was produced with a molar ratio of protein to HOCl of 11000. inhibition of syncytia formation was seen using M8166 cells. pooled plasma protein control had in addition no influence on the formation of HIV-1-induced HeLaT4-lacZ syncytia. HIV-1-isolate IIIB was pre-incubated for 1 h with purified plasma proteins. after 4d the number of syncytia (A,C,E,G) was quantified microscopically. the amount of p24 in the culture supernatant (B,D,F,H) was measured by ELISA. HIV-1 particle with Idea-PP prepared with molar ratio of proteinHOCl of 11000. PP and HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) on cellular infection by different HIV-1 isolates. X4-tropic HIV-1 isolate NL4-3 was pre-treated with the same substances. we chose human serum albumin (HSA) as the most prominent plasma protein. we compared the antiviral effect of their modified forms with that of the corresponding unmodified proteins. inhibition of viral infection by Idea-HSA in comparison to HSA could be observed as reduction of infected cells. the dualtropic HIV-1-strain 93BR020 was pre-incubated with either HSA (G) or with IDEA-HSA 11000 (H) the cells were visualized after 4d. the antiviral effect of Idea-HSA was not limited to X4-tropic isolate IIIB. the number of infected cells (A,B) and the number of syncytia (C,D) per well was quantified microscopically after 4d. surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams of the binding of Idea-ATIII to gp120 (E), to CD4 (F) and to PDI (G) showed high affinity. the binding of Idea-P to gp120, CD4 and PDI is at least partially thiol-mediated. the viral envelope protein gp120, its receptor CD4 and PDI were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of the thiol blocker DTNB. ine specific monoclonal antibody (clone 5F6) was tested by ELISA. the extinction is given as mean SD from three parallel samples. the extinction is given as mean SD from three parallel samples. OCl-altered pooled plasma proteins (Idea-PP) to gp120, CD4 and PDI respectively was determined by specific ELISA. surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams of binding of Idea-PP to gp120 showed high affinity. toxicity of PP (A) or Idea-PP modified in a proteinHOCl ratio of 12000 (B) was controlled by measuring mitochondrial activity of HeLa-T4lacZ cells with MTS assay. the X4-tropic HIV-1-isolate IIIB was pre-incubated for 1 h either with PP (E) or with Idea-PP. HIV-1 infection of these cells transactivates the LTR promoter inducing -galactosidase production. all tested Idea-PP pools reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells in a dose dependent manner. but the non-modified original material had no effect. inhibition of syncytia formation by Idea-PP was seen using M8166 cells. pooled plasma protein control had in addition no influence on the formation of HIV-1-induced syncytia. ted for 1 h with purified plasma proteins, either unaltered (A,B) or modified by HOCl in a ratio PPHOCl of 1300 (C,D), 11000 (E,F), or 12000 (G,H) after 4d the number of syncytia (A,C,E,G) was quantified microscopically and the amount of p24 in the culture supernatant (B,D,F,H) was measured by the X4-tropic HIV-1 isolate NL4-3 was pre-treated with the same substances and given to HeLaT4-lacZ cells (A) the number of infected cells was quantified after 4d. the R5X4-tropic HIV-1 isolate 93BR020 (B\u2013E) was pre-incubated for 1 h with purified plasma proteins. OCl chose human serum albumin (HSA) as the most prominent plasma protein and antithrombin III (ATIII) as representatives for all plasma proteins. inhibition of viral infection by Idea-HSA in comparison to HSA could be observed as reduction of infected cells. the dualtropic HIV-1-strain 93BR020 was pre-incubated with either HSA (G) or with IDEA-HSA 11000 (H) the antiviral effect of Idea-HSA was not limited to X4-tropic isolate IIIB. the number of syncytia (C,D) per well was quantified microscopically after 4d. surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams of the binding of Idea-ATIII to gp120 (E), to CD4 (F) and to PDI (G) showed high affinity. kd is dependent on both the association (on) and dissociation (off) rates of the compound. the binding of Idea-P to gp120, CD4 and PDI is at least partially thiol-mediated. the viral envelope protein gp120, its receptor CD4 and PDI were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of the thiol blocker DTNB. the extinction is given as mean SD from three parallel samples. we tested whether Idea-Ps with antiviral activity contain FDP-lysine groups. a specific monoclonal antibody against FDP-lysine bound specifically and dose-dependently to all our Idea-P preparations. ocytosis is a central feature in numerous inflammatory disorders, like cardiovascular disease. ocytosis is a central feature in numerous inflammatory disorders, like cardiovascular disease. ocytosis is a tightly regulated process. affinities of the single binding sites would not be meaningful. Binding of Idea-PP to gp120, CD4 and PDI prompted us to speculate. neither control PP nor Idea-PP were toxic to host cells. syncytia formation and viral propagation showed that the anti HIV-1-effect of Idea-PP is more general at least to X4-tropic HIV-1 strains. the next step was to elucidate, whether the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system can transform also isolated single proteins into antiviral weapons. all the HOCl modified proteins used in this work showed amyloid-like properties. other proteins, shown to interact with HIV-1 and to inhibit HIV-1 infection, are also known to have amyloid-like properties. exogenous addition of H2O2 and HOCl stimulated NETosis. NETs in addition to bacteria and fungi also capture the human immunodeficiency virus. idea-proteins are very special amyloid-like proteins. FDP-lysine binds covalently to free SH groups of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [47]. idea-Ps binding to gp120, CD4 and PDI is inhibited by DTNB. presumably SH-groups will also link Idea-Ps to its targets on HIV-1. idea-proteins have an amyloid-like structure and bind with high affinity to proteins and regents offering free thiol groups. thioredoxin, a 12-kD redox protein, required for disulfide exchange in domain 2 of CD4, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), essential for reduction of gp120 disulfide bonds. coxsackievirus A9 and dengue fever virus serotype 2 use amyloid recognizing chaperone BiP as a co-receptor for virus internalization. bacitracin is usually considered to be a specific inhibitor of PDI activity. bacitracin significantly inhibits the chaperone activity of BiP. et al Chlamydia attachment to mammalian cells requires protein disulfide isomerase [58] and disulfide oxidoreductase activity of Shigella flexneri is involved in tachyzoite-host cell interaction [60]. PDI was even identified to play an important role in cancer cell invasion [61]. treatment of plasma protein with the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system was shown to lead to the conversion of L-threonine into 2-hydroxypropanal and its dehydration product, acrolein (2-propenal. aldehyde production was also mimicked by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the absence of the enzyme. idea-proteins have an amyloid-like structure and bind with high affinity to proteins and regents offering free thiol groups. as these amyloid-like proteins bind to HIV-1, oligomerize, and built aggregates and nets, they will probably immobilize the virus and interfere with its binding to the cell surface chaperone. thioredoxin, a 12-kD redox protein, is needed for disulfide exchange in domain 2 of CD4, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), essential for reduction of gp120 and gp41 required for virus entry. we hypothesize that Idea-P can inhibit on several levels HIV-1 entry by immobilization and blocking free thiols. the chaperone PDI, the chaperone GRP78/BiP, is involved in HIV-1-infection. involvement of cell surface BiP would also explain the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI) T4 PBK-LTRLac are adherent CD4-positive cells stably transfected with an episomal vector carrying the Escherichia coli -galactosidase gene. the cell line was purchased from the programme EVA Centre for AIDS Reagents (Hertfordshire, UK) and cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L- p24 antigen ELISA developed at the Institute of Applied Microbiology (Vienna, Austria) the monoclonal antibodies 37G12 and Mo1 were used for that assay. the monoclonal antibodies 37G12 and Mo1 were used. newly prepared HOCl was added to the protein in phosphate buffered salt solution. the mixture was incubated for 30 min at RT. a potential toxicity of Idea-Ps was examined using a commercially available test kit. virus in the culture supernatant was examined using the p24 assay described above. the number of infected cells can be investigated by addition of the chromogenic substrate X-Gal. for this purpose the cells were washed with PBS followed by fixing with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. after incubation blue foci were counted microscopically. the selected coating buffers were 15 mM disodium carbonate and 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and 0.25% gelatine solution with phosphate-buffered saline solution +0.05% Tween20. the wells were blocked for 1 h at RT. 100 l Idea-P samples or unaltered mother proteins were added to appropriate wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.005% surfactant P-20; coupling buffer 10 mM NaAc pH 7.0; HIV-1-gp120 20 l (10 g/ml), immobilized amount: 1158RU; PDI 20 l (10 g/ml), immobilized amount: 1396 RU. the experimental procedure for Idea-ATIII is given in detail. tPA, FXII and the chaperone BiP are capable of binding proteins with amyloid modules [66], binding of Idea-PP, Idea-HSA, Idea-ATII to all three general amyloid recognizing tools was studied by an ELISA. the plates were washed 4 times with 300 l washing buffer (PBS-T) per well. idea-PP, Idea-HSA, Idea-ATIII samples or unaltered mother proteins were added to appropriate wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. a secondary peroxidase labeled antibody was added to detect the primary antibody in concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. PBMCs were separated from a blood donation. the X4-tropic viral strain IIIB (subtype B) was grown for propagation in the cell line M8166. the virus is a full-length, replication and infection competent chimera. the X4-tropic viral strain NL4-3 was purchased from AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. the amount of bound p24 was quantified by adding resorufin--D-galactopyranoside substrate solution. the p24 assay was calibrated using baculovirus-derived recombinant p24 as a standard. the cells were infected with different viruses at a concentration of 40\u2013400 ng/ml p24. for this purpose the virus was pre-incubated either with medium or with different concentrations of Idea-Ps. the mixture was given to the cells for 24 h, followed by removal of the cell culture supernatant, intensive washing and addition of fresh medium. syncytia was quantified by counting the syncytia in the microscope. Binding of Idea-P to GP120, CD4 as well as to PDI was demonstrated in a standard ELISA. the bottom of the wells of NUNC MaxiSorpTM polystyrene 96 wells were coated. 100 l ATBS substrate was given to each well, the plates were wrapped to shield from light, incubated at room temperature and the absorbance was read at OD492. a biacore 2000 and a biacore 3000 system (BIACORE AB, Sweden) were used. the sensorgrams were corrected by subtracting the signal from reference flow cell. the non-altered original proteins and protein mixtures were used as controls. inhibition of Idea-P binding to gp120, CD4 or PDI was created. the bottom of the wells of NUNC MaxiSorpTM polystyrene 96 well ELISA plates were coated with tPa, FXII or BiP over night at 4\u00b0C. the selected coating and blocking buffers were 15 mM disodium carbonate and 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer. the plates were washed 4 times with 300 l washing buffer (PBS-T) per well and all residual washing buffer was removed. altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP, A, D, G), altered human serum albumin (Idea-has, B, E, H) or altered antithrombin III (Idea-ATIII, C,F,I) were determined."}
