{"summary": "a retrospective cohort design was used to conduct an epidemiological field investigation. Result There were 7 cases of illness, and the attack rate was 46.67%. the onset date was concentrated on May 9 and 10. the receiving hospital suspected that the patients were infected with MERS. an investigation team was immediately sent to conduct an epidemiological investigation. the body temperature of all the passengers on the flight was measured. the nontour group did not present disease symptoms. the patients were travelling from a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic area. some of the patients had respiratory symptoms. the receiving hospital suspected that the patients were infected with MERS. the temperature of all the fever cases was between 38.5 and 39.0\u00b0C. the frequency of vomiting ranged from 2 to 14 times and the proportion of patients who vomited less than 5 times was 71.43%. most of the patients had elevated neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes. 7 of the 15 members of the tour group were ill, corresponding to an incidence rate of 46.67%. there were 3 males and 4 females in the affected population. the ages ranged from 5 to 62 years old and the median age was 46 years old. laboratory testing for common respiratory viruses and respiratory bacteria was carried out by real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae are conditional pathogens. the results of the PFGE experiment show that the homology to S. enteritidis was 100% (Figure 2). The results of the PFGE experiment show that the homology to S. enteritidis was 100%. boiled eggs were the most likely risk factor for S. enteritidis food poisoning. the rate of illness in those exposed to this risk factor was 6.67 times higher than those who were not exposed to it. blood examination results Fecal examination results Leucocytes(109/L) Neutrophils (109/L) Fecal trait Leucocytes (sample/HP) Case 1 5.31 8.91 0.48 Yellow loose stool 3 0 Case 2 10.06 9.36 0.38 Yellow loose stool 0 0 Case 3 13.67 12.68 0.51 Yellow loose stool 0 0 Case 4 12.40 11.55 0.43 Yellow loose stool 26 2 Case 6 16.12 14.78 0.89 Yellow loose stool 5 1 Case 7 22 the only animal exposure history was travel to a flamingo park to watch flamingos. however, there was a solid glass window between the visitors and the flamingos. there was no chance of direct animal exposure. laboratory testing for common respiratory viruses and respiratory bacteria from the throat swabs was carried out by real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae are conditional pathogens. the homology to S. enteritidis was 100% (Figure 2). the results of the PFGE experiment show that the homology to S. enteritidis was 100%. the rate of illness in those exposed to this risk factor was 6.67 times higher than that in those who were not exposed to it. the outbreak was caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria during the trip because it was a typical point-source epidemic. eggs were the most likely risk factor for S. enteritidis food poisoning. the rate of illness in those exposed to this risk factor was 6.67 times higher than those who were not exposed to it. the outbreak of food poisoning occurred in the UAE, not in china. it was regrettable that we could not travel to the epidemic area to investigate food-related processes, such as the purchasing, transporting, and cooking of potentially infected food. the outbreak of food poisoning occurred in the eastern Mediterranean region. salmonella is one of the leading causes of food-borne enterocolitis worldwide. main serotypes are salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella heidelberg, and salmonella newport. food poisoning caused by salmonella in Germany is the second most common cause."}
