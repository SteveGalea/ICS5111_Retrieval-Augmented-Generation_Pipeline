{"summary": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis is one of the most popular medicinal plants in the world. the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin is currently unclear. a total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. the cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families. the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories. 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. many of the biological activities of the bioactive constituents of G. uralensis have been investigated. this herb exhibits antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus [10], HIV [11,12] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [13]. cytochrome P450 from G. uralensis possesses -amyrin 24-hydroxylase activity in in vitro enzymatic activity assays. a functional -amyrin synthase gene (bAS) has been isolated from G. glabra [17,18], but no progress has been made in the identification of the genes involved in the glycosylation of glycyrrhetinic acid to produce glycyrr a pool of candidate genes for cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases was established, containing 125 and 172 unigenes. the method described here is a cost-effective technology for the identification of novel genes in non-model organisms that serve as medicinal plants. the assembly produced a substantial number of large contigs (10,868 contigs were > 200 bp in length) Approximately 16% of the unigenes (4,337 out of 27,229) were composed of the 454 ESTs and GuESTs data. the 454 sequencing identified 16,130 novel unigenes, bringing the total number of different G. uralensis unigenes in the databases to 27,229. unigenesa number of unigenes 27,229 total length of unigenes 12,360,394 bp unigenes above 200 bp 23,158 aunigenes includes contigs and singletons. most of the unigenes were longer than 200 bp and were valid in this study (85%; 23,158/27,229) unigenes, 20,437 unigenes, had at least one hit within these databases. the remaining unigenes (24.9%) likely comprise G. uralensis-specific genes. the currently available expressed sequences have been invaluable in defining the correct components of the gene structure in this species. glycyrrhizin skeleton biosynthesisa ECb Enzyme name Number of unigenes Number of unigenes Number of ESTs Number of GuESTs Number of GuESTs Number of ESTs Number of GuESTs 2.3.1.9 acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 3 30 28 2 2.3.3.10 HMG-CoA synthase 2 11 5 6 1.1.1.34 HMG-CoA reduc rase 1 63 31 32 2.5.1.10 farnesyl diphosphate synthase 1 1 1 0 2.5.1.21 squalene synthase 1 1 1 0 1.14.99.7 squalene monooxygenase 4 23 23 0 5.4.99.- -amyrin synthase 1 1 1 0 aBLAST against the SwissProt and KEGG databases. squalene synthase (SQS), squalene monooxygenase and -amyrin synthase (bAS) are listed in Table 3. the enzymes involved in the biosyntheses of the isoprene unit and the triterpene skeleton are listed in Additional file 3. CYP88D6 catalyzes the oxidation of -amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo-amyrin in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway. 125 unigenes (500 ESTs) annotated as putative CYP genes were further classified into 32 CYP families and 47 subfamilies. cytochrome P450s (A) and glycosyltransferases (B) in different plant organs. corresponding cytochrome P450 and glycosyltransferases contigs represented by the numbers are listed in Additional file 5. 11 unigenes (33 ESTs) encoded glucuronosyltransferases. glycyrrhizin is composed of aglycone glycyrrhetic acid and two glucuronic acid units. expression patterns of 6 glycosyltransferase unigenes were similar to that of CYP88D6. the list of candidate unigenes for cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases is found in Additional files 7 and 8 respectively. 454 sequencing and assembly A G. uralensis cDNA library was constructed from a pool of mRNA isolated from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. after the initial quality filtering, this one-eighth sequencing run produced 59,219 high-quality reads (HQ reads) with an Approximately 16% of the unigenes (4,337 out of 27,229) were composed of the 454 ESTs and GuESTs data. the 454 sequencing identified 16,130 novel unigenes. this number should cover the vast majority of genes from this species, including those expressed at low levels. unigenesa number of unigenes 27,229 total length of unigenes 12,360,394 bp unigenes above 200 bp 23,158 aunigenes includes contigs and singletons. most of the unigene sequences were longer than 200 bp and were valid in this study (85%; 23,158/27,229) the annotated unigenes were compared with the Arabidopsis proteome [25] using BlastX [22].
