{"summary": "six cell lines were cultured, developed as a cell-chip and used to prescreen patients' sera to select a good candidate cell line for the identification of a membrane antigen. the intense membrane staining of the EA.hy926 makes this cell line a good candidate for the identification of a membrane antigen. ELISA was used to select BD patients who showed relatively higher optical density values of EA.hy926 membrane antigens for further testing. protein immunoblot was performed to screen the putative binding target. expression and purification of the recombinant human annexin A2 protein were performed. the purified annexin A2 protein was confirmed using mass spectrometry. annexin A2 protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21. anti-annexin A2 antibodies were detected in 31 of 90 BD patients. reactivity of serum antibodies against annexin A2 was higher than that in SLE, SS and apparently healthy individuals. expression and localization of annexin A2 in human tissues Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the differences in protein expression in human umbilical vein/artery, squamous cell lung cancer, and kidney cancer tissue samples. annexin A2 was specifically expressed in human umbilical vein/artery, squamous cell lung cancer, and other cells of the vessel. bilical vein/artery, squamous cell lung cancer, and kidney cancer tissues were incubated with anti-annexin A2 mAb. the brown color represents positive identification with the anti-annexin A2 mAb. this result confirmed the presence of AECAs in BD patients. each square represents a patient. the red color represents the corresponding organ involved and green without. the data were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 17, Chicago, IL) protein immunoblot was performed to screen the putative binding target. five subjects from all the BD patients that presented relatively higher optical density values were selected for further analysis. the target protein shared the most significant sequence homology with annexin A2. it was obtained by recombinant DNA technology, and sequenced by mass spectrometry. then using Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and competitive immunofluorescence assays to confirm the protein is a real autoantigen of BD. annexin A2 was clearly present in the immunoprecipitates. the recombinant human annexin A2 protein could significantly reduce the binding activity of BD patient sera in vitro. ELISA was used to detect serum antibodies against annexin A2 in BD patients and controls. optical densities obtained from sera against recombinant human annexin A2 were correlated with those against recombinant human HSP60. expression of annexin A2 in squamous cell lung cancer and kidney cancer tissue was highest among all the cells tested, followed by A549 cells and HUVEC. staining with commercial annexin A2 monoclonal antibodies in human umbilical vein/artery tissues was consistent with the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive BD patients' sera. annexin A2 is a real AECA autoantigen of BD. annexin A2 antibody-positive and other 59 -negative subjects showed a positive reaction with the recombinant human annexin A2 protein. vascular involvement was approximately four times higher in the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive group. annexin A2 is a phospholipid-binding protein that is widely distributed throughout cell membrane26. it is involved in several important biological processes, such as exocytosis and endocytosis, cell cycle regulation and immunoglobulin transport. annexin A2 overexpression has been described in many cancers, including liver, lung and kidney cancers28. annexin A2 was suggested to be a novel membrane autoantigen for BD. vascular involvement was four times higher in the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive group. most researchers believe that BD is related to infection by microorganisms. annexin A2 was suggested as a specific vascular endothelial cell membrane autoantigen of BD. but further investigations are necessary to elucidate the exact roles of annexin A2 in BD pathogenesis. olar epithelial cell line (A549), a human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (HEK293), were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) the human immortalized non-tumorogenic keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was supplied by Cell Lines Service (Eppelheim, Germany) the oral epithelial cells were isolated from a healthy donor. serum was pre-incubated with annexin A2 protein at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (ImmunoHunt, Beijing, China) cell membrane proteins extracted using a ProteoPrep\u00ae Membrane Extraction Kit (Sigma, MO) were dispensed and stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. the gel was then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. the membranes were extensively washed four times with 5% PBST buffer to remove unbound antibodies. the gel pieces were washed with 25 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH4HCO3. after the liquid phase was removed, the gel pieces were completely dried. digestion was performed overnight at 37\u00b0C. igen (5 g) was incubated with 5 L mixed sera at 4\u00b0C overnight. protein A-Sepharose

cancer and kidney cancer tissue samples were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. five-micrometer-thick sections were placed on glass slides, baked for 60 min at 60\u00b0C, incubated for 10 min in xylene, and finally washed with PBS. t-test statistics, Spearman's correlation coefficients, Fisher's exact text, and chi-squared test were analyzed using SPSS software
