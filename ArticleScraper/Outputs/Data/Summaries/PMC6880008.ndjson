{"summary": "the outbreak began with a single case in rural Guinea in late 2013. due to a slow initial response, the virus spread quickly to rural and urban communities throughout Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. many lessons have been learned about EVD as a result of the outbreak, including a much better understanding of the zoonotic origins of the disease. a sizeable literature has established that SES is an important determinant of health. in almost all cases, people or populations of higher SES enjoy longer and healthier lives. in almost all cases, people or populations of higher SES enjoy longer and healthier lives. EVD and Zika seem to follow this pattern as they first emerged in low-income countries. EVD and Zika seem to follow this pattern as they first emerged in low-income countries. a more complex relationship may exist between SES and infectious disease exposure the population level. studies have also explored determinants of EIDs at the sub-national level. cases of Zika were more common in neighborhoods in Rio that were less likely to be connected to the municipal water source. study compared measures of population density and wealth index found that both were positively associated with the transmission rate of the virus at the district-level across west Africa. population density and education, both measured at the regional-level, were also both positively associated with epidemic size and spread across west Africa. communities played an important role in the prevention, transmission and response to the outbreak effectively containing EVD in spite of resource constraints. studies have also shown that the bulk of reported exposures occurred from one family member to another, or from a close friend or neighbor. however, it is unclear how these determinants are likely to be associated with SES. migration, especially migration from rural to urban areas, has also been implicated in the transmission of the virus. studies of risk factors of HIV in sub-Saharan africa initially found a positive relationship between wealth and education and HIV. over time, the relationship appears to have changed as the epidemic matured. inverse relationship between SES and infectious disease outcomes in outbreaks should not always be taken as a given. this paper explores the distribution of exposure to EVD during the outbreak in west africa relative to individual, household, and community measures of EVD. the findings of this study will hopefully be able to contribute to planning against future outbreaks of EVD. in the 6th round, enumerators alternate between interviewing a voting age male or female adult within each household in order to generate gender balance among survey respondents. enumerators alternate between interviewing a voting age male or female adult within each household in order to generate gender balance among survey respondents. individual-level characteristics drawn from the survey included the age of the respondent, whether the respondent was male or female, and the level of education completed. household-level variables were constructed in terms of whether or not the household was located in an urban area and the number of adults in the respondent's household. data on the administrative level unit or region of the household were also obtained from the Afrobarometer survey. in both countries, additional questions were added to the survey to ask respondents about their experiences during the outbreak. in both countries, the survey asked respondents \"Do you know a close friend or relative who was infected with Ebola\" with yes, no, refused, and don't know as potential answers. data from the Afrobarometer to construct household and community-level wealth indices were also obtained from the survey. there were 15 second-level administrative units in liberia and 5 second-level administrative units in Sierra Leone. we defined two EVD exposure variables, both binary variables. survey weights, population-weighted post-stratification, and jackknife variance estimation were used. a household index was also created using a weighted average approach. but since the estimates were similar we use the measures of SES constructed PCA methodology. the sample was well distributed in terms of ages, but was slightly older in Sierra Leone. about half of the sample had more than a primary education, but the liberian sample was slightly more educated than in Sierra Leone. 0.31 376 Community asset score 0.00

due to missing data in variables that make up the community SES index. the number of observations in columns 2, 3, 8, and 9 vary due to missing data for the variables that make up the community SES index. control for community-level education does not systematically affect our associations between individual and household-level SES and exposure. we also replicate all of the same regression results using knowing someone who died of Ebola, and the results are presented in Appendix Table 2. data from a nationally representative household-level survey data from the two most heavily affected countries during the west africa outbreak. we explored how various measures of exposure to EVD were associated with measures of EVD at different levels. we find no overall association between household-level wealth and EVD exposure. urban households were more likely than rural households to report higher levels of exposure of the outbreak. but the reasons for this association are not clear but it does not seem to be explained simply by higher incomes in urban areas. a plausible figure given estimates of network sizes that have been observed in different human populations. the number of close friends and colleagues each individual would have to have would be underestimated since people who knew one case likely knew more than one. this might bias the estimates in the other direction since people who knew cases also died did not answer the survey."}
