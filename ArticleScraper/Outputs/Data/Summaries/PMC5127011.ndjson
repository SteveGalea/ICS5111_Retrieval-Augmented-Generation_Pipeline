{"summary": "intrinsic antiviral defenses include passive features that protect the host from infection. the cell membrane separates the intracellular space from the environment. in addition to intrinsic barriers to infection, cells have innate immune defenses activated by pathogen recognition. Activated IRF3-IRF7 heterodimers translocate to the nucleus to induce the expression of several IFN- subtypes. IRF3 plays a critical role in IFN-I induction but is critical for parallel IFN-independent responses. basal IFN- signaling regulates a number of ISGs involved in antiviral defense, virus recognition and induction of IFN-. basal IFN- signaling regulates a number of ISGs involved in antiviral defense, virus recognition and induction of IFN-. phenotypic changes that occur in primary cells at later passage can impact virus\u2013host interactions. primary cells are often resistant to transfection with plasmid DNA, making transient expression of exogenous genes difficult. the difficulties associated with manipulating primary cells make the use of other models a necessity. cellular immortalization There are multiple paths to cellular immortalization. first, cells must avoid senescence\u2014a state where cells undergo replicative arrest\u2014remain metabolically active. these regions of heterochromatin capping each chromosome become shorter each time the genome is replicated. p53 is an important tumor suppressor lost in most spontaneously immortalized and transformed cells. cytosolic p53 can induce transcription-independent apoptosis by interacting at the mitochondria with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2). p53 was initially discovered as a 53 kDa protein co-precipitated with the SV40 large T antigen (LTA) p53 regulates IFN-I signaling. pRb is another important tumor suppressor that plays a role in antiviral signaling. pRb-binding domains of certain oncogenic viral proteins are important for antagonizing innate signaling. polyoma virus with a mutant T antigen protein unable to bind pRb also unable to block Jak-STAT1 signaling downstream of IFN-I. pRb-binding domain of papillomavirus E7 is required for its ability to suppress nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation downstream the loss of IRF1 leads to the downregulation of antiviral ISGs involved in innate signaling. exogenous IRF5 expression is sufficient to sensitize cells to DNA damage and inhibit tumor growth. knockout of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) primes the IFN-I response through a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent pathway. the two best-characterized DNA sensors upstream of IFN-I induction are cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which non-specifically recognizes DNA in the cytosol. innate antiviral signaling present in cancer cell lines affect both IFN-I signaling and the IFN-independent response. tumorigenesis does not necessarily result in loss of IFN-independent signaling. innate signaling is lost through different mutations selected for during tumorigenesis. 3T3 immortalized MEFs had impaired IFN-I signaling following myxoma virus challenge, making them permissive to infection. the defects in the innate antiviral response of cancer cell lines highlight the care that must be taken during immortalization to preserve antiviral signaling. adenovirus E1A/E1B, papillomavirus E6/E7, or SV40 LTA are also used to immortalize primary cells. these oncogenes antagonize the tumor suppressors p53 or pRb. they also interfere with innate signaling pathways in addition to p53 and pRb. hTERT immortalization leaves innate antiviral signaling intact. hTERT-immortalized cells have intact IFN-I and IFN-independent antiviral responses. in vitro studies will never be able to recapitulate totality and complexity of host antiviral response to infection."}
