{"summary": "the viral RNA polymerases (RdRP) are responsible for replication of both strands of the viral RNA genome and mRNA transcription. the structures of several RdRPs have been solved by X-ray crystallography. phylogenetically conserved motifs can be structurally conserved. 233 in RdRP of poliovirus polymerase (3Dpol) is conserved among the four classes. the homologous residue (D537) in T7 RNA polymerase is essential for polymerase function and coordinates magnesium, required at the active site. in HIV reverse transcriptase the homologous residue (D110) is not essential for RNase H activity, but is for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase function. row A presents the wild type amino acid and nucleic acid sequence for part of motif A. row B shows the mutation that was inserted to construct the mutant D233A. row C shows the mutation that was inserted to construct the mutant D233A. a mutagenized -galactosidase (Whitescript) was used as a positive control for mutagenesis. plasmids were grown and isolated using qiagen kits. poliovirus replicons have a built-in T7 promoter to produce RNA in vitro. the replicons undergo a single round of replication. the luciferase gene is in frame with the genome. cells were scraped, centrifuged and resuspended in 500 l ProMega \"Passive Lysis Buffer\" replicons electroporated into Hela cells and assessed for luminescence at indicated timepoints. we conclude that A231 is not required for poliovirus replicon replication. in 3Dpol, these residues are positioned on the same side of the beta strand."}
