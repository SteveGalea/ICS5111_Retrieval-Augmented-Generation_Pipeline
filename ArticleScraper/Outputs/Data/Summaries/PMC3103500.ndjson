{"summary": "9b is known to localize in the extra-nuclear region and has been postulated to possess a nuclear export signal (NES), but the role of NES in 9b functioning is not well understood. we have also revealed that this NES activity influences the half-life of 9b and affects host cell death. the 9b protein is encoded by ORF-9b of the SARS-CoV genome. a nuclear export signal (NES) present in its 46-LRLGSQLSL-54 amino acid region has been suggested to be responsible for its nucleocytoplasmic export. the requirement for caspase 3 in apoptosis induction was further confirmed using the cell permeant caspase inhibitors. this is the first report associating 9b with nucleocytoplasmic export linked apoptosis. b were replaced by alanine (mu-NES-9bEGFPN1: 46-LRLGSQLSL-54 to 46-ARAGSQASA-54) mutant was further cloned into EGFPN1 vector (Clontech) Creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, leptomycin B, digitonin and cell-cycle inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. cholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. all transfection experiments were performed in triplicates for at least three times. standard deviation was calculated wherever needed. slides were air dried and mounted in 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) antifade reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch), mounted with coverslips, and stored in darkness at 4\u00b0C until examination. controls included mock-infected cells. drug treatment Vero cells were synchronized for 18 hrs by serum starvation. these cells were kept in complete media for 12 hrs. one set of drug treated cells were processed for confocal microscopy. for each sample, about 10,000 events were acquired using a Cyan-ADP flow cytometer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 488 nm excitation. the results were analyzed using \u2018Summit (version 4.3)\u2019 and \u2018FlowJo (version 6.4)\u2019 software. all values were expressed as mean SD. complete transport mixture contained 50\u201375% fluorescent protein diluted with transport buffer. the entire box was then floated in a water bath at 30\u00b0C. each coverslip was rinsed and mounted in a small amount of transport buffer. the coverslips were then blotted to remove excess buffer. nuclear extract preparation and Immunoprecipitation Vero cells were resuspended in 400 l buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor mix) further, the mixture was placed on ice for 15 min. after 15 min, 25 l of 10% NP-40 was added to the transfected or untransfected cells were pulse-labeled for 30 minutes. whole cell lysate was then prepared by cell lysis. cell death was detected using cell-death-detection assay kit. at least 200 cells from three separate images were inspected. Statistical analysis was done using the GRAPHPAD software. unpaired t-test was performed and two-tailed p-value was calculated. mutant of 9b was made using commercially available, PCR based site directed mutagenesis services (Banglore genei, Banglore) d caspase-3 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling. a total of 0.6 million cells were plated in a 60 mm dish. the total amount of transfected DNA was 3 g per 60 mm dish. infected cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH = 7, for 15 minutes at room temperature, at 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post infection. slides were rinsed 35 min in PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1100 dilution of primary antibody in 1% BSA PBST. transfected cells were fixed 36 hrs post-transfection in 2% paraformaldehyde. cells were washed once with 1xPBS and then rehydrated in 1xPBS. cells were mounted using antifade reagent having DAPI (Invitrogen) leptomycin B (LMB) cells were treated with 25 nM drug for 16 hrs. transfected cells were treated with 15 g/ml of the drug for 16 hrs. two hours post-treatment, cells were processed for microscopy. cell pellet was lysed in 1.5 vol of lysis buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM Na3VO4 with a protease inhibitor cocktail) cells were grown on coverslips and were permeabilized by immersion in ice cold transport buffer containing 40 g/ml digitonin for 5 min. mM creatine phosphate (Sigma), 20 U/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA) as a positive control, we have used the NP protein of H5N1 which is known to have two NLS. the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has been used as a negative control. the pellet was resuspended in 200 l of buffer C (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor mix) the samples were kept on ice for 20 min. immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously. at least 200 cells from three separate images were inspected. a western was performed using cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 specific antibodies. cell viability assay (MTT assay) was determined using a colorometric detection assay kit. infected cells showed numerous nuclear foci of 9b protein by 36 h post-infection. many nuclei were changing their appearance and undergoing apoptosis. by 48 h post-infection, many nuclei were seen to be changing their appearance and undergoing apoptosis. only cells showing clear nuclear localization of 9b were scored positive. similar results were also obtained with HEK-293T and COS-7 cells. expression of the SARS-CoV 9b protein in the cytoplasm. infection with SARS-CoV labelled with antibody for 9b (green) and DAPI counter-stain for nuclei (blue) the first column shows zoomed close-ups of typical examples of an uninfected cell, and infected cells at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection respectively. cells were treated with aphidicolin (G1-S phase inhibitor) at a concentration of 1.5 g/ml. the percentage of cells arrested at the G2-M phase of the cell-cycle after nocodazole treatment was 57.9%. pEYFPN1-9b transfected cells were treated with 1.5 g/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) yellow color of 9b was converted into green. aphidicolin inhibited the S-phase entry of cells. proteins have been confirmed by in-vitro transport assays using digitonin-permeabilized cells. the protein was expressed in vero cells separately and then their lysate was added to digitonin permeabilized cells. the cells were supplied with all necessary components needed for in-vitro transport. in-vitro transport assay performed in absence of WGA shows nuclear localization of SARS-CoV 9b protein. panel (i) shows the localization of GFP tagged nucleocapsid protein of influenza that was used as a positive control. digitonin permeablized cells were treated with a drug known to inhibit active NES based export. the protein was able to enter the nucleus even in the presence of WGA. the NES has been reported to be present in the C-terminal region of the protein. the data obtained was confirmed by performing biochemical analysis of fractionated lysates of transfected cells. nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 36 hrs post-transfection. a lot of 9b was seen in the nucleus 48 hrs post infection. the localization pattern of SARS-CoV 9b protein having mutated NES. the protein gets concentrated in nucleus. panel (i), (ii) and (iii) shows mu-NES-9b, DAPI and a merge image respectively. nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 36 hrs post 9b transfection. both mu-NES-9b as well as LMB treated 9b have increased nuclear localization of 9b. upper panel shows that 9b is present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. active nuclear export takes place by interaction of the nuclear export signal (NES) with a protein known as Crm-1. the complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting. p value for differences between 9b, mu-NES-9b and 9b+LMB for time point of 30 min and 60 min was significant as the p value ranged from p = 0.0004 to p = 0.0013. a number of 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells died on treatment with LMB. the role of other viral proteins in this process can not be ignored. western blot results show that 9b-EYFP induce apoptosis. lysates were checked for the levels of cleaved caspase-3. cell lysate was used to measure cleaved caspases by Western blotting. only cleaved caspase 3 was picked up demonstrating role of caspase 3 mediated apoptosis in cells having export deficient 9b protein. lyzed 36 hrs post transfection and lysates checked for levels of caspase-3. negative control inhibitor (Z-FA-fmk) had no inhibitory effect on apoptosis. results confirm that apoptosis induced by 9b is caspase dependent. these foci of fluorescence first appeared in the nucleus at 24 h post infection to reach a maximum at about 36 hr. p.i., and are somewhat reduced in numbers at 48 h p.i. slides were imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 Laser Scanning Microscope with Zen2009 version 5.5 software. three-dimensional volume projections were rendered in \u201cVolume Viewer\u201d using \u201cImageJ\u201d version 1.43 g. merged 2-channel confocal images of infected Vero E6 cells stained with anti-9b antibodies. the purity of the extracts was checked using anti-actin and anti-polymerase II antibodies. the SARS-CoV 9b protein localizes in both cytoplasm as well as nucleus when expressed in transfected cells. blocking cell-cycle at the G2 phase (using nocodazole) did not affect the cellular localization pattern of the 9b protein. cell-cycle inhibitors do not affect the localization pattern of the SARS-CoV 9b protein. b was converted into green; panel (i), (ii) and (iii) shows 9b, DAPI and a merge image respectively. nocodazole treated cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometer. wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin known to inhibit active nuclear transport, was found to get restricted to cytoplasm. however, SARS-CoV 9b showed similar nuclear localization even in presence of WGA. in-vitro transport assay performed in presence of 50 g/ml WGA shows a passive mode of import for SARS-CoV 9b protein. panel shows that the nucleocapsid protein of influenza was unable to enter the nucleus in the presence of WGA. 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells were treated with a drug known to inhibit active NES based export. we found that most of the 9b protein accumulated within the nucleus upon LMB treatment. cytoplasmic fluorescence in lower panels confirms the effect of cyclohexamide treatment. the effect of LMB was checked and the proportion of 9b in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was compared using densitometric analysis. a lot of 9b was seen in the nucleus 48 hrs post infection. this may be attributed to the impact of other SARS-CoV proteins on 9b localization. results show that in presence of the drug used, most of the 9b protein gets blocked in the nucleus. panel (i), (ii) and (iii) shows the protein localization in LMB treated cells. panel (iv), (viii) and (ix) shows the effect of cyclohexamide (CHX) on LMB treated cells. synchronized cells were transfected with the appropriate constructs. lysate was immunoprecipitated using the mentioned antibodies. mutated NES clearly shows inhibition of binding of 9b with Crm-1. 9b behaves like a shuttle protein, going into the nucleus passively and coming out using the NES. similar results were observed for 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells treated with a nuclear export inhibitor, LMB. blocking active nuclear export of 9b protein induces apoptosis in transfected cells. a number of 9b-EYFPN1 transfected cells died on treatment with LMB. similar results were observed for mu-NES-9b (Fig. 7a, right panel) the lysates were checked for the levels of cleaved caspase-3. apoptosis induced by 9b (blocked in the nucleus) was caspase dependent. an NES based nuclear export of 9b appears to be very significant for host survival. caspase 3 mediated apoptosis in cells having export deficient 9b protein. cleaved caspase 3 is present only in LMB treated 9b protein. lane 4 shows the controls used in the assay. a time course study of 9b revealed that the pattern of its cellular localization remained unchanged irrespective of post-transfection time. disruption of 9b-Crm1 binding after mutating the critical residues within the NES, and nuclear accumulation of 9b on treatment with a Crm1 antagonist, reconfirmed our hypothesis. nocodazole is an anticancer drug that interferes with the structure and function of microtubules during interphase and blocks cell-cycle progression at the G2-M phase. a low level of apoptosis observed for nocodazole treated cells is a well established effect of this drug. the half-life of 9b protein in cells is about 20 minutes and an active nuclear export is mandatory for proper degradation of the 9b protein. the dependence of 9b degradation on NES is also supported by increased half-life of both mutant and 9b treated with LMB. NES of 9b may remain unexposed until it binds to the nuclear proteins. this interaction may be exposing NES of 9b leading to the export of \u2018X\u2019 proteins along with 9b using the Crm1 dependent pathway. this event may stop host cell response against stress caused by the viral infection. in-vivo studies as well as identification of the nuclear protein/s specifically binding to 9b will help in further understanding the role of 9b in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. this study uncovers an important step in understanding the roles of accessory proteins in the SARS-CoV life-cycle. cytoplasm localizes in the nucleus even in the presence of WGA. proteins below 50 kDa have been reported to get into the nucleus passively. there is a fair possibility of passive diffusion even as a dimer. deletion of the NES present in 9b as well as LMB treatment of cells has been reported to retain 9b in the nucleus [18]. we observed similar results when we repeated these experiments. BLAST analysis of the NES region of SARS-CoV 9b protein revealed that this region was well conserved. the degradation of many shuttle proteins has been reported to get delayed if their export is inhibited. the SARS-CoV 9b protein triggers caspase 3 mediated apoptosis. the absence of significant cell death in case of EYFP-N1 transfected, LMB treated cells ruled out the possibility of drug induced cell death. NES of 9b may remain unexposed until it binds to the nuclear proteins. this interaction may be exposing NES of 9b leading to the export of \u2018X\u2019 proteins along with 9b using Crm1 dependent pathway. this event may stop host cell response against stress caused by the viral infection. pEYFPN1-9b or pEYFPN1 were transfected with either pEYFPN1-9b or pEYFPN1 alone. after 36 hrs, cells were fixed and mounted. panel (ii) indicates some protein also enters into the nucleus. the pulled-out proteins were run on a 15% SDS PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 2 shows the proteins pulled out with mock lysate."}
