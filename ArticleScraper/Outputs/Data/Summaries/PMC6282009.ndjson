{"summary": "CF is the most common severe autosomal recessive genetic disease in the Caucasian population. it is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (1\u20133). in airways, CFTR dysfunction leads to alterations in mucociliary clearance and impairment of innate immune host defenses. CHAC1 was identified in mammalian cells for the first time in 2009 as a new component of the unfolded protein response pathway (11) this UPR pathway is induced in response to ER stress due to the presence of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. these three pathways alleviate ER stress by decreasing protein synthesis and facilitating protein folding. primary hAECBs from CF patients or healthy donors were grown as previously (17, 18) the cells were seeded in different plates (TPP, Techno Plastic Products, Trasadingen, Switzerland) after reaching confluence and were incubated overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics before being stimulated in same medium free of antibiotics. the OD measured at 600 nm was adjusted to give the desired MOI. cells seeded in 6-well (hAECBs) or 12-well plates were infected with Pa. reverse transfection in NCI-H292 and/or A549 cells with either siRNA for CHAC1 (siRNA CHAC1, s35570) or negative control (siRNA Ctrl) from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA) cells were seeded either in 96- (A549) or 12-well (NCI-H292) plates and transfected the same day with 5 nM siRNA. after 48 h of reverse transfection, cells Western blotting Total proteins were extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA/Protein kit (Macherey Nagel) an equal amount of proteins was reduced, size-separated on 10 or 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS-Tween 0.1%. IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1 (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and PGE2 (Cayman, Ann Harbor, MI, USA) were measured in cell supernatants using ELISA kits. NF-B luciferase activity NF-B luciferase activity in A549 cells was assayed with a Luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) primary hAECBs from CF patients or healthy donors were commercially obtained. the cells were seeded in different plates (TPP, Techno Plastic Products, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and after reaching confluence. the cells were seeded in different plates (TPP, Techno Plastic Products, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and after reaching confluence. clinical strains of Pa were isolated according to the standards procedures of the microbiological department of the St-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France. a 10-L aliquot was plated on different selective media for 5 days at 37\u00b0C under aerobic conditions. RT qPCR RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA/Protein kit (Macherey Nagel, Duren, Germany) RT was performed using a high-capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) NF-B-p65 (S536 and D14E12; CST); and -actin (A2228; Sigma-Aldrich); -actin (a2228; Sigma-Aldrich); -actin (a2228; Sigma-Aldrich); -actin (a2228; Sigma-Aldrich); -actin (a2228; Sigma-Aldrich); -actin (a2228; Sigma-A differences between groups were assessed for statistical significance using Prism 7.00 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) mRNA expression in hAECBs from patients without CF (black) and with CF (gray) stimulated with 1 g/mL LPS and 50 ng/mL flagellin or infected with PAK (MOI 0.25) for 6 h. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. hAECBs from CF and non-CF patients expressed CHAC1 mRNA at sufficient levels for further knockdown experiments. 6 h of stimulation with LPS and flagellin induced CHAC1 expression in hAECBs from non-CF patients. this induction by LPS and flagellin was not found in hAECBs from CF patients. this induction is highly variable between the clinical strains used. the number of the bacteria used for stimulation is similar. the induction of CHAC1 mRNA expression by PAK strain is also highly variable. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. CI-H292 cells treated with increasing concentrations of MG-132 for 6 h. next, we examined CHAC1 protein expression in response to Pa stimulation. however, we were unable to detect endogenous CHAC1 protein in NCI-H292 at baseline or after Pa infection. inhibition of ATF4 expression by the siRNA ATF4 (60%) was associated with an inhibition of CHAC1 induction by LPS. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney tests (*p 0.05). CHAC1 overexpression induced by Pa did not stimulate apoptosis. we examined levels of cleaved PARP and caspase-3. cleavages were observed when CHAC1 was overexpressed with a plasmid in NCI-H292 cells. transfection with CHAC1 siRNA induced around 50% reduction in CHAC1 mRNA expression (Figure 5A) we then examined different inflammatory parameters, particularly the secretion of IL-8, IL-6, and PGE2. PGE2 productions in supernatants from cells transfected with siRNA control (siRNA Ctrl, black) or siRNA CHAC1 (gray) for 48 h and stimulated with LPS and/or flagellin for 6 h. data are expressed as means SEMs of 10 independent experiments. IL-6 and CCL-2 were not detectable by ELISA. IL-6 and CCL-2 were not detectable by ELISA. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. l vs. siRNA CHAC1 groups, #p 0.05; ##p 0.01; ###p 0.001) defective regulation of CHAC1 in CF cells. mRNA was only induced in hAECBs from non-CF patients. mRNA expression in hAECBs from patients without CF (black) and with CF (gray) stimulated with 1 g/mL LPS and 50 ng/mL flagellin. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. 6 h of stimulation with LPS and flagellin induced CHAC1 expression in hAECBs from non-CF patients. this induction was not found in hAECBs from CF patients. the difference in CHAC1 expression observed with the FliC strain was not due to different MOI. strain is also highly variable (Figure 2C), and is likely due to the variability in the inoculum used. we also observed that the induction of CHAC1 mRNA expression by PAK was higher in NCI-H292 cells than in hAECBs. Statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. we were unable to detect endogenous CHAC1 protein in NCI-H292 cells. also, we were unable to detect CHAC1 protein expression after treating the cells with tunicamycin, a known inducer of CHAC1 mRNA expression (24). however, we hypothesized that induction of CHAC1 by LPS from Pa may be mediated by PERK. CHAC1 mRNA expression in NCI-H292 cells stimulated with 1 g/mL LPS in DMSO (vehicle) or 1 M PERK inhibitor (Inh PERK) or stimulated with 0.5 g/mL tunicamycin (TM) with or without PERK inhibitor for 6 h. data are means SEMs of five independent experiments. the positive control staurosporine induced cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. in contrast, Pa did not induce cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. PARP and caspase-3 cleavages were observed when CHAC1 was overexpressed with a plasmid. IL-8, IL-6, and PGE2 secretion induced significant increases in IL-8 and IL-6 secretion. mRNA expression in cells stimulated with 80% inhibition, flagellin (30% inhibition), or combination of both virulence factors (80% inhibition) data are expressed as means SEMs of 10 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison tests (control group: NS, *p 0.05, ****p 0.0001) and Wilcoxon tests. IL-6 and CCL-2 were not detectable by ELISA. IL-6 and CCL-2 were not detectable by ELISA. results are shown as p-NF-B/NF-B ratios. data are expressed as means SEMs of four independent experiments. the mRNA is one of the most differentially expressed transcripts between primary bronchial cells from CF and non-CF patients, infected with Pa. CF cells exhibited an expected excessive inflammatory response, including higher IL-8 production (10) mRNA induction by LPS and Pa was not related to PERK activation, as is TM, but was dependent on ATF4 in mice with deletion of the Chac1 gene. mRNA induction was not related to PERK activation, as is TM, but was dependent on ATF4. inhibition of CHAC1 mRNA expression by siRNA inhibits IL-6 production, suggesting that CHAC1 may promote IL-6 expression. previous studies have shown that IL-6 production in bronchial IB3-1 (CF deficient) and C38 cells stimulated with flagellin (12) induction of CHAC1 in bronchial epithelial cells led to induction of PARP cleavage, indicative of cell apoptosis. apoptosis dysfunction remains highly controversial in CF. inflammation is complex and thought to have a critical impact during the course of CF lung disease (47). a better understanding of the link between infection and inflammation is thus required for the development of new therapeutics."}
