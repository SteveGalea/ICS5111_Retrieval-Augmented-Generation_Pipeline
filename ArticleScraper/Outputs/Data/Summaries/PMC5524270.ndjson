{"summary": "viruses are dependent on the cells of living hosts for replication and/or replication. they exist as small nucleic acid structures (DNA or RNA) enclosed within a protein shell (capsid) that is sometimes surrounded by a lipid membrane or as nucleic acid-protein complexes comprised of one or more viral proteins required for movement. identification and characterization of virus\u2013host protein interactions are critical steps in understanding how pathogens cause disease. co-IP provides a high-throughput way to identify and characterize multiple virus\u2013host interactions in a single experiment. the technique is becoming more established in the field of virology, but remains a fairly expensive and laborious process. a simplified, bead-free, microplate-based co-IP assay was used in mammalian studies. we tested the effectiveness of using a simplified, bead-free, microplate-based co-IP assay. this was followed conditions used for detection of virus by ELISA. bars represent the average MS1 peak areas se for 4 peptides (Supplemental Dataset S1) from BSA, IGG, and PLRV CP from WT co-IPs for n = 9 (blocked) and n = 6 (unblocked) the genome of PLRV is compact and comprised of 9 open-reading frames (ORFs) that have been found to code for biologically functional proteins. the coat protein (CP), encoded by ORF3, accounts for the majority of the 180 proteins in the capsid structure. merase generated by a 1 ribosomal frameshift in the overlapping region of ORF1 and ORF2,26 and the multidomain P1 protease (ORF1) undergoes self-proteolysis to produce 3 distinct protein species. the association of these nonstructural proteins in viral co-IP experiments was not dependent on the presence of the RTD. protein complexes were extracted from 1 g cyro-lysed tissue on ice using 2.5 ml 1 PBS, pH 7.4. dilution of Halt EDTA-free protease inhibitor (PI) cocktail. homogenate was used for experiments without centrifugation. 100 l plant homogenate (in 1 PBS, pH 7.4, plus PI) was incubated in unblocked, antibody-coated wells for 1 or 16 h at 4\u00b0C. for all experiments, change in absorbance (405 minus 490 nm) was measured on an Epoch spectrophotometer. one hundred microliters of the 1 PBS-extracted plant homogenate was added to antibody-coated wells. plate was dried between each washing step by inverting and tapping the plate firmly on lint-free Kimtech KimWipes (Kimberly-Clark Professional, Roswell, GA, USA) peptides were solubilized in 5\u20138 l Solvent A by vortexing for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and bath sonication for 5 min. a flow rate of 2 l/min flushed the sample out of a 5 l loop and onto a self-packed capillary trap column. automatic gain control was set to 1,000,000 ions, with a max ion injection time of 200 ms. monoisotopic precursor selection was on with the exclusion of unassigned and 1+ charge states. each sample was analyzed once as result of the small sample volume used to maximize peptide concentration. analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference post hoc test using the webserver http://astatsa.com/OneWay_Anova_with_TukeyHSD/. all raw MS, Mascot generic format, mzID, and Scaffold analysis files are available for download on ProteomeXchange (PXD006338).

LRV RTP was detected with an average Mascot protein score of 743 and an average exponentially modified protein abundant index of 1.8 in WT co-IP samples. these scores were lower than what we observed when using antibody-coated magnetic beads (13,632 and 78.23, respectively), indicating a lower abundance of PLRV captured using the bead-free method. peptides from the RTD were not detected in RTD mutant co-IP experiments. 7% for MS1 peak intensities among co-IP technical replicates. median levels of PLRV CP in mutant co-IPs were 1.7 (SpC) and 2.5 (MS1 of 3 CP peptides)-fold lower compared with WT (Supplemental Fig. S1C, D), a difference we did not observe when using magnetic beads. 188 plant proteins were detected in either mock-infected-only or mock-infected. only 16 of these proteins enriched 2-fold in the PLRV bead-free co-IPs compared with mock. in viral bead-free co-IPs compared with negative controls, we found that 62% of these proteins were significantly enriched using the magnetic bead approach. it is interesting to note that most of these plant proteins were abundantly detected (average SpC >20) in our co-IP samples, suggesting that there may be a limit in detecting plant\u2013virus interactions using the bead-free workflow.
