{"summary": "introduction of zoonotic diseases have been emerging worldwide. cats share habitats with humans, domesticated animals and wildlife. some viruses that infect domestic cats are genetically close to viruses from humans. a total of 319 526 sequence reads showed detectable similarity to viral sequences. the majority of bacteriophage sequences in cat faeces belonged to the dsDNA order Caudovirales and the ssDNA family Microviridae. the most highly represented mammalian viruses were, in order of sequence read abundance, mamastroviruses (63.7 % of all viral reads) from the family Astroviridae. Viruses with lower levels of similarity to known genomes belonged to four viral families. family Astroviridae consists of positive ssRNA viruses. genomes range in length from 6.4 to 7.3 kb. despite overall genomic similarities to other astroviruses described to date, slight differences were identified in FastV-D1. despite overall genomic similarities to other astroviruses described to date, slight differences were identified. the three feline astroviruses in the present study fell into two genetic lineages within the genus Mamastrovirus. the tree for the Cap region indicated that FastV-D1 was related to the clade composed of mink astroviruses and a California sea lion astrovirus. the tree showed that FAstV-D1 was more closely related to the fox astrovirus. bocaviruses were identified in five of the six cat faecal pools. the complete genome of FBD1 was 5407 bases with 304 bases in the 5\u2032 UTR and 136 bases in the 3\u2032 UTR. the complete genome of FBD2 was 5466 bases, of which the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs were 309 and 211 bases. vovirus 1 species clustered closely with three feline bocaviruses from Hong Kong. another species of cat bocavirus (FBoV2-POR1) was described recently. RT-PCR was then used to test individual specimens for FeBoV3-FBD1. cycloviruses were present in only one pool of cat faecal samples. a complete genome of cyclovirus was acquired and named CyCVs-FD. cycloviruses were present in only one pool of cat faecal samples. four different sequence contigs showed low identity on protein level to RdRp of RNA viruses. the first contig was 471 bases and the putative amino acid sequence shared 30 % identity with the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a member of the family Picornaviridae. the fourth contig contained two large ORFs encoding non-structural and structural proteins. the putative amino acid sequence encoded a complete RdRp region. tetnovirus-2 was found in human faeces and predicted based on nucleotide composition to be of insect host origin. fesavirus-2 sequence (GenBank accession number KM017737) clustered with those of five viruses from the Hepeviridae clade. Fesavirus-3 (GenBank accession number KM017738) and fesavirus-4 sequences (GenBank accession number KM017739) were related. infected animals often develop persistent infection and shed the virus over extended periods of time. the coronavirus in the present study also belonged to type I. there were 19 sequence reads related to FHV-1 in the cat faecal virome. a total of 504 feline panleukopenia virus sequence reads were identified in two sample pools, sharing high sequence similarities (98\u2013100 %) to several closely related feline panleukopenia virus strains. the sequence reads of known viruses reported here are available in the online Supplementary Material. 1.2 % of cat faecal virome (3786 sequence reads) was related to plant viruses. RNA viruses accounted for the rest, with the majority related to ssRNA viruses in the family Phycodnaviridae. % of reads were related to viruses from the family Nodaviridae. the majority of bacteriophage sequences in cat faeces belonged to the dsDNA order Caudovirales and the ssDNA family Microviridae. Viruses with lower levels of similarity to known genomes belong to four viral families known to infect mammals. astroviruses have been associated recently with encephalitis in a child with agammaglobulinemia. s of feline astroviruses FastV-D1 (GenBank accession number KM017741), FastV-D2 (GenBank accession number KM017742) and FastV-D3 (GenBank accession number KM017743) were 6598, 6813 and 6748 bases, respectively. slight differences were identified in FastV-D1 despite overall genomic similarities to other astroviruses described to date. stroviruses, amino acid sequence alignments of the three feline astroviruses in the present study and 23 representative astrovirus strains were performed. the tree for the Cap region indicated that FastV-D1 was related to the clade composed of mink astroviruses and a California sea lion astrovirus, sharing 58 and 56 % amino acid similarity, respectively, in the Cap region. bocaviruses were identified in five of the six cat faecal pools. the complete genome of FBD1 was 5407 bases with 304 bases in the 5\u2032 UTR and 136 bases in the 3\u2032 UTR. the complete genome of FBD2 was 5466 bases, of which the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs were 309 and 211 bases. bocavirus type 1 (carnivore bocaparvovirus 1 species) clustered closely with three feline bocaviruses from Hong Kong. another species of cat bocavirus (FBoV2-POR1) is shown in Fig. 3(b, c) as GenBank accession number KF792837. cycloviruses were present in only one pool of cat faecal samples. a complete genome of cyclovirus was acquired and named CyCVs-FD. the genome of CyCVs-FD consisted of 1773 bp and had the typical genome organization with two main ORFs arranged in opposite directions. four different sequence contigs showed low identity to RdRp of RNA viruses. the first contig was 471 bases and the putative amino acid sequence shared 30 % identity with the foot-and-mouth disease virus. blastp indicated that this amino acid sequence shared the highest sequence identity (28 %) with calhevirus-1. the fourth contig contained two large ORFs encoding non-structural and structural proteins. the putative amino acid sequence encoded a complete RdRp region. tetnovirus-2 was found in human faeces and predicted based on nucleotide composition to be of insect host origin. p clustered with those of five viruses from the Hepeviridae clade. p was closest to those of calhevirus-1 and tetnovirus. infected animals develop persistent infection and shed the virus over extended periods of time. the coronavirus in the present study also belonged to type I. all sequence reads shared high sequence similarities with several closely related feline coronaviruses strains. feline panleukopenia virus belongs to the feline parvovirus subgroup within the genus Parvovirus. a total of 504 feline panleukopenia virus sequence reads were identified in two sample pools. the sequence reads of known viruses are available in the online Supplementary Material. 1.2 % of the cat faecal virome (3786 sequence reads) was related to plant viruses.
