{"summary": "the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to a large number of countries within a few months. the virus is grouped either a novel group IV or an early split-off of group II coronaviruses. replicase genes span the first two-thirds of the genome. canonical RdRp synthesizing short primers for nsp12, a superfamily 1-like helicase (HEL1 = nsp13), and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU = nsp15) nsp3, nsp14, nsp16 are thought to have ADP-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase, 3\u2032->5\u2032 exon a number of MHV and SARS-CoV replicase proteins colocalize and eventually interact in cytoplasmic membrane bound complexes. direct interactions of nsp7 and nsp8 in a hexadecameric supercomplex could be demonstrated by crystallography [20] for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms during the course of viral growth and propagation. sequences made them compatible to the gateway\u00ae recombinatorial cloning system. allowing the cloning into a so-called pDONR207 vector with the subsequent subloning into the destination vectors pGADT7-DEST (prey) and pGBKT7-DEST (bait) products of ORFs 1a and 1ab with predicted processing positions are listed as non-structural proteins nsp1 through nsp16. nucleotide positions used to clone the individual SARS-CoV ORFs and the expected amino acid length are also given. pGADT7-DEST and pGBKT7-DEST containing the SARS ORFs were transformed into the haploid yeast strains AH109 and Y187 respectively. all ORFs were tested pairwise against each other and 900 individual interactions were tested in quadruplicates. p2 and nsp8, and the accessory protein ORF9b showed a rather large number of interactions (8, 14 and 15 interactions, respectively) y2H matrix screen was performed by mating S. cerevisiae strains AH109 and Y187 containing prey and bait vectors with the respective SARS-CoV ORFs on selective media. positive interactions in yeast (black and grey squares) were retested by CoIP in mammalian cells (293cells coIPs of non-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8. 293 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF-7. after 20 hours half of the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated. nsp 8 and nsp12 proteins interacted with ORF9b and nsp13 in both directions in the Y2H system. interaction between nsp1, nsp8, nsp11 and accessory proteins ORF3b, ORF7b and ORF9b could be confirmed by CoIP. a deletion mutant was made by synthesizing a DNA fragment that included changes that ablate each of the ORF9b ATG start sites while maintaining the primary sequence of the N protein. the recombinant virus had normal plaque sizes and grew like wildtype virus in Vero cells after infection at a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. thus, deletion of ORF9b is not lethal. the clustering coefficient is approximately as high as expected at random given the degree distribution. for the cellular networks it is actually smaller, whereas for the cellular networks it is much higher. ER networks [47] are created by connecting edges randomly. ES networks are created by an edge swapping strategy. the average clustering coefficient of 1000 randomized ES networks. SARS-CoV proteins depicted in dark red, their direct targets (distance 1) in light red, neighbours of the direct targets (distance 2) in orange and neighbours of the latter (distance 3) in yellow. we tagged the SARS-CoV protein on both the N- and C- terminus and only considered the cellular localization correct if consistent with both tags. nsp3 was subdivided into a N-terminal (nsp3N, nt positions 2719\u20134431) and a C-terminal (nsp3C, nt positions 4885\u20138484) fragment containing the ADP-ribose-1\u201dmonophosphatase domain. an accessory ORF14 described only by Marra et al. was also included. nsp3 A819-G2740 1922 2719\u20138484 M 221 26398\u201327063 nsp3C: (PLP) E1541-2740G 4885\u20138484 nsp4 K2741-3240Q 500 8485\u20139984 N 422 28120\u201329388 nsp5: 3CLpro S3241-3546Q 306 9985\u201310902 nsp6 G3547-3836Q 298 20589\u201321482 Products of ORFs 1a and 1ab with predicted processing positions are listed as non-structural proteins nsp1 through nsp16. nucleotide positions used to clone the individual SARS-CoV ORFs are also given. of 65 interactions detected by Y2H 25 were corroborated by CoIP. non-structural proteins nsp12 (RdRNAP) and nsp13 (C/H, NTPAse, dNTPAse, 5\u2032- to 3\u2032 RNA helicase, DNA Helicase, RNA 5\u2032- triphosphatase), nsp8 and accessory protein ORF9b, nsp14 (C/H, 3\u2032- to interactions of non-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8 could be confirmed by CoIP. nsp3N, nsp6, nsp8, nsp11 and nsp16 and ORF 3a could be confirmed. 293 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF-7. c-myc-tagged plasmids carry the respective SARS-CoV ORFs. co-precipitated proteins are expressed as N-terminal fusions with the corresponding SARS-CoV ORF in plasmids pGADT7 and pGBKT7. nsp11, nsp11 and nsp8 reacted with the only recently described accessory structural proteins ORF3b, ORF7b and ORF9b. interaction between the structural proteins N and M was found positive by CoIP only. comparison of network parameters of viral and cellular protein interaction networks. the average degree and characteristic path length are slightly smaller than in the KSHV network. the fraction of pairwise interactions confirmed among those tested is higher in the KSHV network. ER 2.92 1.56 87.12 174.3 Enrichment over ES 1.00 0.75 7.02 12.44 The table shows network parameters for two viral and two cellular protein interaction networks. the network contains 65 interactions between 31 nodes with 6 of those interactions being self-interaction. the literature screen for intraviral SARS interactions identified 23 interactions. 3 of these were also determined by the Y2H screen. the figure shows the SARS interaction network (A) and proteins and interactions separated from the SARS network. some of the proteins were not expressed if tagged either N- or C- terminally. some were not expressed at all and were not included in the analysis. ORF3a, ORF7a and M were detected in the ER. nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp2, nsp2 and nsp2. nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2 and nsp2. nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2 and nsp2. nsp8 deletion or irreversible fusion to nsp7 or nsp 9 results in a lethal phenotype supporting the idea that nsp8 is absolutely essential for virus replication. a hexadecameric nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex was described which was suggested to encircle RNA. interactions between nsp12 and nsp8, and helicase nsp13 in both directions of the Y2H screen. nsp2 interacted with seven other nsps including nsp8 and with one of the newly described structural proteins ORF3a. the relatively large number of interactions might imply a crucial role of nsp2 in the viral life cycle. relocalization of nsp2 to small vesicular foci in the cytoplasm was also confirmed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence staining with anti-nsp2 antibodies. only few interactions were found for the structural proteins, which might be biased by transmembrane sequences preventing the transfer of expressed prey. there is no reasonable explanation for the large number of interactions found for ORF9b by the Y2H screen. the 9b protein may function to enhance the global stability of the SARS proteome network and play some unrealized role in regulating virus-host protein-protein interactions. protein ORF6 and ORF7b, interacting in Y2H and CoIP, were found in the ER. not much is known about ORF9b other than it is expressed in infected cells. antibodies to it are found in infected patients. mutant viruses lacking nsp2, nsp8 or ORF9b could be confirmed biochemically. future experiments with mutant viruses will show relevance of interactions detected for virus replication, growth and pathogenicity. gene-specific 5\u2032 forward sequence introduced an AUG start codon prior to the predicted protease cleavage sites with further 14\u201327 nucleotides downstream. the 3\u2032 reverse sequence (n) matched 13\u201320 nucleotides downstream. oligos were synthesized as the coding (5\u2032-AAAAAGCAGGCT-3\u2032) and non-coding (5\u2032-AAAAAGCTCCGCCATCATCAT-3\u2032) strands.
