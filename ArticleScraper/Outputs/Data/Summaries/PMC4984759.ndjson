{"summary": "the 2000 LHID population consisted of 1 million people randomly selected by the national health research institutes from the 2000 Registry for Beneficiaries of the NHI claims database. we included 950 492 individuals in the analysis. the probability of developing active TB disease is highest in the first year after exposure to the pathogen. the delay from disease onset to diagnosis of TB is less than 3 months for most TB cases in Taiwan. we therefore defined the relevant exposure window as 8 to 15 months (240\u2013450 days) before the index date. the LHID contained no information on health behavior (e.g., smoking, alcohol use) and socioeconomic status, which are known risk factors for TB. we used an independent and nationally representative cohort of participants in the 2001 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey to analyze the association between these risk factors and health care visits. exposure window was 8 to 15 months (240\u2013450 days) before the index date. we calculated the frequency of outpatient visits prior to the index date. the probability of developing active TB disease is highest in the first year after exposure to the pathogen. the LHID contained no information on health behavior (e.g., smoking, alcohol use) and socioeconomic status, which are known risk factors for TB. these risk factors might therefore confound the association between health care visits and TB if they were positively associated with frequency of health care visits. taiwan, 2003\u20132010 Characteristic Case (n = 4202), no.

TB patients were most likely to be seen in the internal medicine, family medicine, and pulmonology services before diagnosis. the health care\u2013seeking behavior of Taiwanese people could have contributed to the spread of TB in health care settings. our study could suffer from confounding bias attributable to factors that were unmeasured or inadequately adjusted for. we found that the positive and dose-dependent association between health care visits and risk of TB was still present. our findings suggest TB programs should improve early TB detection and treatment, consider implementing cough officer screening in high-risk waiting areas,32,33 adopt upper room germicidal ultraviolet systems,34 and apply ventilation regulation in outpatient service areas. the guidelines mainly focus on operation rooms and airborne infection isolation rooms. the dose\u2013response analysis of health care visits and TB may suffer from confounding bias attributable to factors that were unmeasured or inadequately adjusted for. we found that the positive and dose-dependent association between health care visits and risk of TB was still present. we validated our case definition against the reference in the national TB Registry. our findings suggest that TB programs should improve early TB detection and treatment, consider implementing cough officer screening in high-risk waiting areas,32,33 adopt upper room germicidal ultraviolet systems,34. the guidelines mainly focus on operation rooms and airborne infection isolation rooms."}
