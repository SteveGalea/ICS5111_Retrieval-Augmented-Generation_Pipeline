{"summary": "OP was first described as a clinical pathology syndrome characterized by granulation tissue in the lumens of small airways, alveolar ducts and the alveolar space by Epler et al. in 1985. this condition is regarded as a common reaction of lung tissue to different injury factors. it can be manifested as diffuse alveolar damage, OP, acute fibrinous and OP and certain types of fibrotic lung disease. a previously healthy 19-year-old patient was transferred from the outer court with a 9-day history of fever, cough and expectoration in September, 2015. the patient experienced an internal fixation surgery for a left clavicular fracture 8 days before the outset of the symptoms. the chest computer tomographic (CT) showed cluster and patchy shadows in the lower lobes of bilateral lungs, but no pleural effusion was observed in either lung. physical examination revealed the patient had a temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C a heart rate of 115 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and an oxygen saturation level of 95%. laboratory data suggested a white blood cell count of 10,720 cellsmm3 (10.72 cells 109 L-1) with 62.8% neutrophils, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h a reexamination of methylprednisolone was 3.28 mg/L. he was discharged one day later and continued taking 20 mg prednisone acetate daily. 36 days later, all symptoms disappeared and a significant improvement in the chest CT was seen. IL-17A is an important inflammatory cytokine that is closely associated with Th17 cell inflammation. to further verify whether Th17 cells were involved in the development of OP, we performed an immunohistochemical staining analysis of IL-17A. resulting positive expression of IL-17A was more than that of the healthy subject. the pathogenesis of OP is still not completely understood. some scholars consider that alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells are damaged by multifarious factors. the pathogenesis of OP is still not completely understood. a patient with OP attributed to internal fixation surgery for a left clavicular fracture had no symptoms. the patient developed a fever, cough, expectoration and multiple patchy exudations in the chest CT postoperation. this should be the first case report about an unusual OP secondary to extrapulmonary surgery."}
