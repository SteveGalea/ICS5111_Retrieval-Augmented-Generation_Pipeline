{"summary": "the treatment of the first and three subsequent US patients outside of Africa at Emory University provided a number of challenges, as well as strategic and tactical lessons. the treatment provided a number of challenges, as well as strategic and tactical lessons that included detailed planning and team work across multiple academic and health care units. the value of mobilizing a diverse health and academic community to work collaboratively to addressing a global threat is emphasized. the unit was built and set up in close collaboration with and with financial support from the adjacent CDC to provide care for CDC scientists and staff who have contracted highly communicable infectious diseases. the unit was designed to provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation with more enhanced capacities than are normally provided to isolate patients in many hospital settings. the SCDU offers on-call, highly trained staff operating under ready-to-go protocols for providing care for patients infected with highly communicable contagious diseases. the isolation rooms feature negative pressure air handling, 20 air changes per hour, with laminar flow and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering completed before the air is 100% exhausted outside of the hospital. general and intensive care can be provided. Emory\u2019s TravelWell is part of a 57-site worldwide travel network (GeoSentinel) with a 10-year database of 3,000 entries of those who either had returned ill following travel to liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, or Nigeria or had just emigrated from one of those countries. the SCDU was designed to provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation with more enhanced capacities than are normally provided to isolate patients in many hospital settings. the decision to accept EVD patients came from the missionary organizations Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Serving in Mission (SIM) USA. the decision was based on the need, confidence in the overall preparedness of EUH and the more than a decade of training and preparation. the overall effort has directly involved over 125 staff and support personnel. there were daily communications between the SCDU medical team and the CDC\u2019s division of high-consequence pathogens and pathology. the primary focus of training was on biosafety for all individuals who provided direct care. support included contacting key national and international research leaders in EVD, evaluating, contacting, and obtaining, through outside groups, experimental vaccines and new drugs for Ebola. the ehory environmental health and safety office (EHSO) was engaged immediately after the call for ongoing support. the SCDU medical team is led by the SCDU director, an ID trained physician who has spearheaded over a decade efforts in establishing the protocols, training, education, and operations of the unit in conjunction with the CDC. three other faculty members of the department of medicine, four additional ID physicians, two pathologists, five medical technologists and 21 critical care nurses also support the unit. an operations team of key administrators and nursing and physician leadership met twice a day. a pediatric ID specialist with experience in EVD provided support for the frontline medical team. the team was supported by the department of emergency medicine and the Emory office of critical event preparedness and response. Critical Care established a 24/7 Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) attending coverage for critical care management issues including airway management and line placement issues. the location of the SCDU away from other patient care units of EUH significantly reduced the impact on other health care delivery and patient operations. waste management for EVD is a significant hurdle. EVD results in copious amounts of vomit and diarrhea with up to 10 liters of fluid lost by patients each day. a large-capacity autoclave was mobilized. more than 84,000 media stories have been written linking Emory and Ebola. more than 202,000 registrants have downloaded educational materials. a chart-warning flag was implemented to avoid unauthorized access to electronic medical records. yellow fever and Lassa fever can cause similar symptoms to those of Ebola. the intersection of the seasonal influenza epidemic with returning CDC workers from West Africa further amplified the evaluations of febrile episodes. five hospitals, including many in academic medical centers, have now been designated as Ebola treatment centers. the event was initiated to better understand EVD pathogenesis and therapeutic options [7\u201311,15\u201319], including optimal patient management, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and dialysis [7\u20138] and levels of EVD viremia. Ebola viruses have a very low infectious dose, 1\u201310 aerosolized organisms, in nonhuman primate models [12] and can reach extremely high levels in blood (up to 1010 RNA copies per ml of serum [13]), stool, sweat, and other body secretions. exposure of health care workers to infected body fluids via emesis, sweat, urine, saliva, diarrhea, or blood is a significant concern. team engagement demonstrated the importance of melding the philosophies of clinical treatment/practice and biocontainment/biosafety. EVD results in copious amounts of vomit and diarrhea with up to 10 liters of fluid lost by patients each day. all waste in toilets was disinfected with an EPA-registered disinfectant before flushing. more than 84,000 media stories have been written linking Emory and Ebola. more than 20,267 registrants have downloaded these educational materials. yellow fever and Lassa fever can cause similar symptoms to those of Ebola. the intersection of seasonal influenza epidemic with returning CDC workers from West Africa further amplified the evaluation of febrile episodes. policy and procedures for the continuing care of discharged patients were also developed. the CDC and the US Department of Health and Human Services have now been designated as Ebola treatment centers. the event was initiated to better understand EVD pathogenesis and therapeutic options [7\u201311,15\u201319], including optimal patient management, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and dialysis [7\u20138]. the Task Force is directed at facilitating cross-cutting institutional initiatives such as EVD research, education and training activities. the Task Force includes leaders from across the campus and is directed at facilitating cross-cutting institutional initiatives such as EVD research, education and training activities. the task force includes leaders from across the campus and is directed at facilitating cross-cutting institutional initiatives such as EVD research, education and training activities. institutional experience, while providing the opportunity to effectively care for these individuals, led to best practice information and the education and training of others, created key academic, governmental, and community partnerships, expanded research programs in EVD. Mobilizing our diverse academic community to work collaboratively on this emerging disease is also an important long-term outcome."}
