{"summary": "multiple studies using animal models of viral disease demonstrate a correlation between apoptotic potential and disease severity. however, gaps in knowledge about the identity of death signaling pathways that modulate virus-induced apoptosis in vivo have hampered the deployment of this strategy for treatment of viral disease. treatment of cells with soluble TRAIL receptors or expression of a dominant-negative form of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein blocks apoptosis. caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage are observed in cells infected with reovirus. it is not known whether Bid plays a functional role in apoptosis induction by reovirus infection. NF-B activation depends on the viral 1 protein and can be accomplished by genome-deficient reovirus particles. blockade of NF-B signaling using chemical inhibitors or cell lines genetically deficient in NF-B p50, NF-B p65/RelA, IB kinase (IKK)-, or IKK adaptor IKK/NEMO significantly diminishes reovirus-induced apoptosis. deficient mice display diminished susceptibility to reovirus-induced CNS disease following either peroral (PO) or intracranial (IC) inoculation. results define an important role for Bid in virus-induced apoptosis and disease. decreased levels of FL Bid correlated with a corresponding increase in levels of tBid. we assessed levels of procaspase-9 as a surrogate for the formation of the caspase-9-containing apoptosome. this suggests that following reovirus infection of murine fibroblasts, Bid serves to activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. hypothesized that caspase-8 activity as a consequence of extrinsic prodeath signaling, is required for cleavage and activation of Bid. to test this hypothesis, we assessed the capacity of reovirus to mediate Bid cleavage in L929 cells treated with caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK. as anticipated, Bid cleavage was not observed in mock-infected cells or mock-infected cells treated we compared reovirus-induced apoptosis in wild-type and Bid-deficient MEFs. apoptosis was assessed by chemiluminescent measurement of the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7. infection of wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h post-infection. caspase-3/7 activity was determined after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. results are expressed as the mean ratio of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cells for triplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD. titers were determined after two cycles of freeze-thaw by plaque assay using L929 cells. results are presented as mean titers from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD. reovirus replicated with similar kinetics and produced equivalent yields in wild-type and Bid-deficient cells. the failure of Bid-deficient cells to undergo apoptosis in response to reovirus is not a consequence of diminished reovirus infection. wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs were transfected with pNF-B-luc, which expresses firefly luciferase under control of NF-B. at 18 h after transfection, cells were mock-infected or infected with T3D at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell. infection of wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs with reovirus results in generation of tBid at 36\u201348 h after infection. treatment of both wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs with apoptotic agonists TNF and cycloheximide resulted in efficient cleavage of Bid. findings suggest that cleavage and activation of Bid following re reovirus is activated via a mechanism distinct from NF-B following reovirus infection. for these studies, we assessed the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis in MEFs lacking TRAIL-R. in comparison to mock infection, T3D infection of wild-type cells resulted in an MOI-dependent 5- to 20-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h post-infection. wild-type or TRAIL-R-deficient MEFs were adsorbed with T3D at the MOIs shown. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, cells were stained with AO. results are expressed as the mean ratio of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cell lysates. reovirus-induced cleavage of Bid is dependent on signaling via TRAIL-R. at 48 h post-infection of wild-type cells, FL Bid was cleaved to generate tBid. however, FL Bid was not cleaved in T3D-infected TRAIL-R-deficient cells. virulent, enteric, neurotropic reovirus strain, T3SA+ [50] monitored infected animals for signs of neurological disease and infection-induced morbidity over a period of 21 days. most wild-type mice developed paralysis and respiratory distress. the majority of Bid-deficient mice were asymptomatic. titers of reovirus were comparable or slightly higher (5- to 10-fold) in the intestine, liver, and heart of wild-type mice. wild-type animals showed 25- to 100-fold higher titers in comparison to those in Bid-deficient mice at 8 d post-inoculation. two-day-old wild-type and Bid-deficient mice were inoculated intracranially with 100 PFU (A) or 5 PFU (C) of T3SA+. mice were monitored intracranially with 100 PFU (B) or 5 PFU (C) of T3SA+ and euthanized at the times shown. peak titers of reovirus in the brains of intracranially-inoculated wild-type mice were 1000-fold higher than those in perorally-inoculated wild-type animals. to test this hypothesis, we inoculated wild-type and Bid-deficient animals intracranially with a considerably lower but still lethal dose of T3SA+, 5 PFU, and monitored infected animals for signs of reovirus encephalitis. hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained coronal brain sections prepared from wild-type and Bid-deficient mice euthanized 10 d following IC inoculation with 5 PFU of T3SA+. this time point was chosen to coincide with the presence of maximal viral titers following inoculation by this route. however, inoculation of wild-type mice with T3SA+ resulted in neuronal death two-day-old wild-type and Bid-deficient mice were inoculated intracranially with 5 PFU of T3SA+. at 10 d post-inoculation, brains from infected mice were resected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. reovirus displayed similar tissue distribution in wild-type and Bid-deficient mouse brains. generation of tBid following reovirus infection is dependent on caspase-8 Reovirus infection of HEK293 epithelial cells leads to a biphasic loss of full-length (FL) Bid [16] is not known if Bid is cleaved in all cell types infected by reovirus. we assessed levels of procaspase-9 as a surrogate for the formation of the caspase-9-containing apoptosome. in a time frame consistent with cleavage-induced generation of tBid, we observed a decrease in procaspase-9 levels in reovirus-infected cells. this suggests that following reovirus infection of murine fibroblasts, Bid serves to activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. reovirus was generated at 36\u201348 h after reovirus infection of vehicle-treated cells. reovirus failed to efficiently induce activation of Bid in Z-IETD-FMK-treated cells until 48 h post-infection. this suggests that Bid functions similarly following reovirus infection by linking the death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. tosis was assessed by chemiluminescent measurement of the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7, which serve as effector caspases for both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. infection of wild-type cells resulted in an increase in caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h post-infection. despite a low frequency of infection, this MOI resulted in an 3-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity. cells were treated with 10 M staurosporine (Sts) for 24 h as a control. wild-type or Bid-deficient MEFs were adsorbed with T3D. results are expressed as the mean percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. we compared wild-type and Bid-deficient cells using an AO staining assay. infection of wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells at 48 h post-infection. in contrast, Bid-deficient cells infected with T3SA+ showed levels of apoptosis equivalent to mock-infected cells, 10%. similar results were obtained following infection with another apoptosis-pro we conclude that Bid is a key regulator of reovirus-induced cell death. signaling via NF-B promotes cleavage-induced activation of Bid. we compared reovirus-induced NF-B activation in wild-type and Bid-deficient cells. wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs were mock-infected or infected with T3D at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell. cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TNF and 10 g/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) p65/RelA-deficient MEFs with reovirus did not lead to tBid generation. treatment of both wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs with apoptotic agonists TNF and cycloheximide resulted in efficient cleavage of Bid. findings suggest that cleavage and activation of Bid following reovirus infection requires NF-B. apoptosis in wild-type and TRAIL-R-deficient MEFs showed morphologic features of apoptosis in comparison to mock-infected cells. differences in the apoptotic potential of reovirus in wild-type and TRAIL-R-deficient cells are not associated with differences in reovirus growth. results are expressed as the mean ratio of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cell lysates. results are expressed as the mean ratio of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cell lysates. reovirus-induced cleavage of Bid is dependent on signaling via TRAIL-R. at 48 h post-infection of wild-type cells, FL Bid was cleaved to generate tBid. in contrast, FL Bid was not cleaved in T3D-infected TRAIL-R-deficient cells. 91% of wild-type mice succumbed to reovirus infection with a median survival time of 11 days, whereas only 30% of Bid-deficient mice died. cellular apoptotic regulator Bid modulates reovirus replication and pathogenesis. titers of reovirus were comparable or slightly higher (5- to 10-fold) in the intestine, liver, and heart of wild-type mice. wild-type animals showed 25- to 100-fold higher titers in comparison to those in Bid-deficient mice at 8 d post-inoculation. both strains of mice succumbed to reovirus-induced disease with equivalent frequency and a median survival time of 13 days. reovirus titers in the brains of wild-type and Bid-deficient mice also were comparable at 4, 8, and 10 d post-inoculation. reovirus in the brains of intracranially-inoculated wild-type mice was 1000-fold higher than those in perorally-inoculated wild-type mice. we inoculated wild-type and Bid-deficient animals intracranially with a considerably lower but still lethal dose of T3SA+, 5 PFU, and monitored infected animals for signs of reovirus encephalitis. the median survival time of wild-type mice inf hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained coronal brain sections prepared from wild-type and Bid-deficient mice euthanized 10 d following IC inoculation with 5 PFU of T3SA+. this time point was chosen to coincide with the presence of maximal viral titers following inoculation. the extent of injury following inoculation of wild-type mice was not as extensive. high magnification images of the boxed region of the hippocampus shown in (A) stained in consecutive sections with H&E, polyclonal reovirus-specific antiserum, or activated caspase-3-specific antiserum. intense brown staining indicates caspase-3- or reovirus-positive cells. in this study, we evaluated the function and regulation of Bid in apoptosis caused by reovirus. we found that although Bid is dispensable for reovirus replication in cell culture, it is required for the induction of apoptotic cell death following reovirus infection. the fragment of reovirus 1 protein induces apoptosis by directly targeting mitochondria analogous to PB1-F2 [13] our studies using apoptosis-defective reovirus mutants support the idea that -mediated NF-B signaling activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indirectly via death-receptor signaling and Bid cleavage. three previous studies have attempted to identify proapoptotic host genes that serve as effectors of the death response following reovirus infection. in the first, gene-expression profiles following infection with reovirus strains type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Abney (T3A), which differ in the capacity to induce apoptosis [58] were compared by microarray analysis. apoptosis-regulating, transcriptional targets of NF-B were not identified in these studies. changes in expression of prodeath genes activated by reovirus infection may be too transient to have been detected in intervals selected for analysis. reovirus infection may regulate death signaling at a post-transcriptional level by an as yet unknown mechanism. the role of Bid as an apoptosis regulator contributes to viral replication and consequent neurovirulence. we hypothesize that neurons function like type I cells when infected at a higher dose of virus and do not require the amplification of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via Bid to elicit cell death. it is not known how Bid controls the efficiency of reovirus replication in the CNS. one possibility is that Bid-regulated apoptosis is required for efficient release of virus from neurons. blockade of apoptosis by other means also should cause a delay in reovirus replication. the function of Bid in viral pathogenesis has been examined in a previous study. the BH3-only protein, Puma, but not Bid, contributes to apoptosis-mediated elimination of antigen-specific T cells following acute infection with herpes simplex virus-1. reovirus strain T3D is a laboratory stock. reassortment of reovirus strains T1L and type 3 clone 44-MA. virions were generated from second- or third-passage lysate stocks. cell lysates were prepared by washing cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by lysis using 1 RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1% TX-100, 1% DOC, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA) membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% milk caspase-3/7 activity wild-type, Bid-deficient, or TRAIL-R-deficient MEFs (104) were seeded into black clear-bottom 96-well plates
