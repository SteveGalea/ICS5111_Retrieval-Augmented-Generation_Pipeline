{"summary": "emergence of human H1N1 viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir and human H3N2 viruses resistant to amantadine 4 have raised concerns about the use of these antivirals. 8, 9, 10 Accurate, specific, and rapid detection and quantification of influenza virus are critical for successful development of diagnostic tests and antiviral drugs. a detection system for influenza A virus was developed based on a virusinducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS) 24 These preliminary studies with transiently transfected cells demonstrated the potential of this approach to detect and quantify influenza A virus using a luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene system. four oligomers were used to make a 174 base pair oligonucleotide. the oligonucleotides were designed so that after annealing there would be a 3 or 4base 5\u2032overhang on each end to allow ligation to the Bsm BI site in pHH21 and a Pme I restriction site between the two UTR elements. red colored letters are B/Yamanashi NP 5\u2032UTR (62 bases) blue color letters are B/Yamanashi NP 3\u2032UTR (101 bases) red colored letters are B/Yamanashi NP 5\u2032UTR. transfected cells were transfected with linearized pHH21influenza A virus/LucHyg, pHH21influenza B virus/LucHyg, pHH21influenza A virus/GFPHyg and pHH21influenza B virus/GFPHyg. cells were cultured in media containing 150 g/ml hygromycin B. cells were then triedpsinized and serially diluted into 96well plates the H5N1 strains were supplied by Battelle and tested in their biosafety level 3 facility in Columbus, OH, USA. the cells were centrifuged for 1 hour at 700g and incubated in 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 20\u201324 hours. light source for the microscope was a Mercury100W (Chiu Technical Corporation, Kings Park, NY, USA) neutronization assay Influenza A/WSN/33 virus (5000 infectious units) or A/Wisconsin/56/2005 (500 infectious units/well) were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. the cells were washed once with serumfree medium or phosphatebuffered saline. dilutions 104 through 109 were used to inoculate 10 wells of each cell type. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs of the influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 H1N1) NP genomic segment were inserted between the human polymerase I promoter and the terminator elements in plasmid pHH21 25. the oligonucleotides were designed so that after annealing there would be a 3 or 4base 5\u2032overhang on each end to allow ligation to the Bsm BI site in pHH21 and a Pme oligomers were used to create plasmids pHH21influenza A virus/LucHyg and pHH21influenza A virus/GFPHyg. a similar strategy was used for the influenza B virus UTRs from the NP segment of the NP strain. plasmids pHH21influenza A virus/LucHyg, pHH21influenza B virus/LucHyg, pHH21influenza A virus/GFPHyg and pHH21influenza B virus/GFPHyg were grown in the same medium as the 293T cells. the transfected cells were cultured in media containing 150 g/ml hygromycin B. one well from each colony of the other plate was either infected with influenza A or influenza B virus or used as an uninfected control. the cells from colonies with a high infectedtouninfected ratio of luciferase or GFP activity were selected for further subcloning. ELVIRA\u00ae Flu BRluc cells were lysed and analyzed for activity using the BrightGlo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) a veritas Luminometer was used to measure relative light units (RLU) according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions. luciferase activity measured as RLU of wells with serumtreated virus compared with the virusonly controls. 1% guinea pig red blood cells (RBCs) were added to the virusserum solution. ELVIRA\u00ae Flu Aluc cells were used to assess the inhibition of influenza A by various concentrations of amantadine or bafilomycin. the cells were plated in 96well plates as described above and incubated with serial dilutions of the drugs for 15 minutes (amantadine) or 30 minutes (bafilomycin) at 37\u00b0C. luciferase activity was measured at various time points after virus infection and expressed as RLU/well. luciferase activity was measured at various time points after virus infection. we included in this analysis four strains of highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza A virus which all were able to induce luciferase in the ELVIRA\u00ae Flu Aluc cells. as shown in Table 1 the titers generated with both cell lines were very similar. ELVIRA Flu A and MDCK cells were planted in 96well plates. they were then infected with the 104 through 109 dilutions (10 wells/dilutions) after infection, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 or 48 hours. a high level of expression in the cytoplasm of influenza A virusinfected ELVIRA\u00ae Flu AGFP cells and influenza B virusinfected Flu BGFP cells. no crossinduction was observed. these cells could be useful in methods for which there is an advantage to using either live or intact cells. one isolate of influenza B virus (B/Taiwan) induced a low level of luciferase, but two others did not induce activity in the ELVIRA\u00ae Flu Aluc cells above background (Table 2). both cell lines were also infected with a panel of unrelated respiratory viruses at a high MOI.

ELVIRA Flu A and MDCK cells were planted in 96well plates and then infected with the 104 through 109 dilutions (10 wells/dilutions) after infection, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 or 48 hours. lines express GFP following influenza virus infection using the same strategy. no crossinduction was observed in the cytoplasm of influenza A virusinfected cells. one isolate of influenza B virus (B/Taiwan) induced a low level of luciferase, but two others did not induce activity in the ELVIRA\u00ae Flu BRluc cells above background (Table 2). both cell lines were also infected with a panel of unrelated respiratory viruses at a high MOI.
