{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) have been linked to cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) rabies, Herpes B virus, Marburg and Ebola viruses were transferred from NHP to humans. more than 150,000 carcasses of NHP per year are traded in Nigeria and Cameroun. wild meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases. people eating NHP ignore or express indifference to risk of contracting simian pathogens. in Indonesia orangutans could be purchased for $100. some restaurants prepare dishes containing orangutan meat if requested by customers. global primate trade estimated 450,000 NHP/year. bushmeat was found in luggage at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris and Toulouse Blagnac airport, France. a metagenomic sequencing performed on African NHP bushmeat demonstrated the presence of sequences related to several viruses related to the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae bacteriophage families. some of them infecting bacterial hosts that could be potentially pathogenic for humans. live NHP illegal trade has increased over time, along with the escalating demand for wild animal as pets. china and Southeast Asia was considered a primary region of origin for US wildlife imports with 150,000 live macaques during the 2000\u20132013 period. in Peru, between 100 and 1,000 NHP are illegally traded each year. there is evidence for illegal trade at the Columbia, Peru and Brazil cross-border. the FELASA provide an approach to monitor and control both endemic and incoming pathogens. monitoring for tuberculosis or rabies is required upon arrival of the NHP. two-thirds of all species occur in just 4 countries. 440 orangutans (Pongo abelii and Pongo pygmaeus) confiscated at receivers in Indonesia. the illegal trade continues to exist despite prison sentences handed down to offenders. the outbreaks of yellow fever in South American NHP are a recent example. non-infected humans can be infected when they visit wild sites. non-infected humans can be infected when they visit wild sites were infected NHP. a national anti-YF vaccination campaign was launched. time between Archeabacteria and Eubacteria was 3 to 4 billion years ago (46) divergence of Old World monkeys and hominoid primates (apes, humans) was an estimated 23 million years ago (46) hominoid primates (apes, humans) were an estimated 23 million years ago (46) the divergence between Eubacteria and Eukaryotes was >3.5 billion years ago (48). earliest eukaryotic cells are expected to have got their cytoplasm from Eubacteria, their nucleus from Archebacteria, and their mitochondries from an aerobic prokaryote (49). our first ancestor, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, lived in africa 6 My ago. Homo sapiens emerged much later, 0.15 My ago. chimpanzees and gorillas, only the Alu(\u2013) allele was observed. the extinction of entire tribes of Native Americans was partly linked to the importation of smallpox by Europeans in the Western Hemisphere (59). the distribution of ABO alleles across human and NHP reflects the persistence of an ancestral polymorphism that originated at least 20 My ago (61). mycobacterium tuberculosis kills 1.7 million people annually from tuberculosis. this pathogen is sometimes found in NHP. more than 1.6 million people die from diarrheal disease, and 800,000 from malaria. a zoonosis is any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans. most EID in humans originate from zoonoses after hazardous events, the occurrence of which is impossible to predict. an EID is obviously unusual; it is surrounded by uncertainty and anxiety. pathogens transmitted to humans by farm animals or pets do not originate from NHP. most pathogens transmitted to humans by farm animals or pets do not originate from NHP. pigs play a role in the transmission of influenza A/H1N1 to humans. rabies can also be transmitted in unconventional manners such as the west Nile virus, a vector-borne pathogen maintained in a bird-mosquito cycle that infects horses. gorillas spend most of their lives at ground level rather than in the trees like most other primates. this ecological disaster has had surprising consequences by attracting more curious nature lovers into places where apes still live. measles virus, human gut Salmonella and Campylobacter reported. apes in africa parks showed a high prevalence of parasitic gastroenteritis. chimpanzees are particularly threatened by infectious disease. global demand for natural resources eliminated more than 100,000 orangutans in the past decades. the population of gibbon is about 47,000 in Thailand; 4,500 agile gibbons in the Bukit Barisan Selatan NP of Indonesia; 5,000 sylver gibbons in Java; and 2,000 individuals in China. the international trafficking of apes was well-documented in a report from UNEP and UNESCO (91). the diversity of human pathogens found in NHP leaves no doubt as to the susceptibility of great apes to pathogens widely present in humans. in recent years, primatologists pointed out the misdeeds and risks of ecotourism and have advocated: (i) to limit the frequency and duration of visits; (ii) to reduce the number or visitors; (iii) to prohibit access to people with known diseases; (iii) to banish the ecotourists' consumption a sample from the marmoset's oral mucosa was tested and found positive for HHV1. despite treatment, this NWM died 2 days later (101). human metapneumovirus infection was reported in western lowland gorillas and in the local human population. five animals succumbed to the disease and the NHP had seroconverted to Mycoplasma pneumoniae a pathogen of probable human origin (108). Attempts to investigate NHP microbiome suggested that bacterial diversity is shaped by ecology and life history rather than phylogenetic relationships. monkey bites account for 2 to 21% of animal bites injuries worldwide. monkey bites account for 2 to 21% of animal bites injuries worldwide. bites are located on the hands, arms and legs (121) bacteria isolated from humans bitten by monkeys cover a large spectrum of species including Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., Bacteroides spp., and Fusobacterium spp. (122) ygis was found in captured rhesus monkeys (128). endemic Treponema pallidum infection with genital stigmata in NHP from Guinea, Senegal, and Tanzania. Klebsiella pneumoniae Coughing, sneezing, dyspnea, pyrexia, lose weight Coughing, respiratory droplets, body fluids Incubation: 1 day to 4 weeks Pneumonia. fever, cough, shortness of breath Meningitis Amoxicillin. lesions primarily infects children Lesions: bumps on the skin of the face, hands, feet, and genital area Antibiotics (benzathine-benzylpenicillin) The medication mentioned in the right column is indicative but must obviously be adapted according to the characteristics of the pathogen and the patient's symptoms. trypanosoma cruzi, a pathogen isolated in 1924 from squirrel monkeys, causes anorexia, weight loss, dehydration in monkeys and Chagas disease in humans. the parasite Entamoeba histolitica, common in OWM, has been reported in most NHP including the great apes (gibbons, orangutans, and chimpanzees) verania spp. found in various apes identified lineages in eastern chimpanzees as well as western lowland gorillas that were nearly identical to P. falciparum and P. vivax. cross infection of P. knowlesi has been documented in humans. enteroviruses A and B have been isolated from chimpanzees. new simian enteroviruses have been isolated from chimpanzees. the risk for retroviruses transmission from NHP to humans has been deeply studied. 5% of humans infected with HTLV-I suffer from adult-T leukemia or tropical spastic paraparesis. SRV was found in pigtailed macaques, crab-cating macaques, rhesus macaques, celebes macaques and cynomolgus monkeys. simian retrovirus, SFV, present in saliva of infected animals, is widespread. transmission of SFV to humans during monkey bites documented in hunters living in Cameroun and a person who has had contact with macaques (M. fascicularis) in Indonesia. infection has been reported in 1\u20134% of persons who worked with NHP in zoos, primate centers, and laboratories. up to 24% in workers after bite or scratch by gorillas or chimpanzees (159\u2013161) among 2,000 travelers in Southeast Asia seeking care for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, 31% consulted after they had been injured by NHP (173) rabies is not a notifiable disease, yet there are a few reports of human rabies following exposure to NHP. s rhesus, cynomolgus, stump-tailed and other macaques are highly prevalent (90%) in adult macaques (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis) asymptomatic macaques shed virus in oral and genital secretions. this herpesvirus provokes conjunctivitis, flu-like symptoms. travelers are immunologically naive, but there is a lack of evidence of Cercopithecine herpesvirus infections among travelers. this virus was found in 14% of free-ranging rhesus macaques of Silver Springs State Park, a popular public park in Florida USA (182). this population of wild NHP, breeding very rapidly, is currently considered as a public health threat. symptoms treatment Antiviral therapy under evaluation (cidofovir) marburg virus; Ebola virus Severe hemorrhagic fever. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Fatal cases (around 50%) Preventive YFV vaccine (99% immunity) monkeypox virus (MPXV) isolated from cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis) is a zoonotic virus endemic in western and central Africa. MPXV was then found in monkeys caged in zoos and primate research facilities. but the main host of MPXV appear to be wild squirrels. between 1970 and 1983, 155 human cases have been reported (80% expected to be of animal origin) since 2016, human monkeypox cases were reported in DRC (>1,000 cases reported per year; incidence rate: 5.53 cases per 10,000 people), Republic of the Congo (88 cases/y), Nigeria (89 cases/y), Central African Republic (19 cases/y), Liberia (2 cases/y), and Sierra Leone (1 case/y) thirty-one people (25 staff members and 6 secondarily infected humans) developed severe hemorrhagic fever, among which 6 died from the disease. eight years after the isolation of this first filovirus, MARV was found to cause the death of a young Australian who had traveled throughout Zimbabwe. humans cases of RESTV infection remained asymptomatic, but surveillance is required to limit the risk of transmission of a mutant virus to humans. traveling to regions of the world where hygienic conditions remain inadequate, and touching wildlife with a special attraction for NHP may still have undesirable consequences. emergence of a new pathogen in the human ecosystem is impossible to predict. there is no guarantee of quick identification. serious health crises are very rare even if there are examples of major EID such as HIV or Ebola virus. ill rate of travelers varies from 15 to 70% according to destinations, conditions of stay and epidemiological survey carried out. ill rate of travelers is associated with illegal detention of NHP as pets and tourists contact with NHP during trips. human-to-human transmission of Cercopithecine herpesvirus was reported in a woman who became infected after applying hydrocortisone cream to her husband's Cercopithecine herpesvirus skin lesions. rabies is a small part of the problem since high-risk travelers are usually vaccinated (215) there is no vaccine for most pathogens present in the NHP. species have been reported confirming the existence of different genotypes of Cercopithecine herpesvirus (217) this might suggest that some genotypes of this Herpesvirus might be more suitable than others to cross the species barrier. there has also been no report of serious case in the population of people living in close proximity with NHP. travelers/ecotourists should be encouraged to self-screen clinical signs. pre-exposure vaccine (pre-exposure) may be recommended. rabies vaccine exempts of PEP. blood samples from the victim should be collected and immediately sent for serological testing. buccal and conjunctival swabs from the victim should be used for culture and rapid PCR-identification of pathogens. exposure clinical survey of the patient is necessary to identify possible signs of illness (such as fever, pain, or shock) if there is evidence for a new pathogen, warning signal are needed for early detection and control of new infectious disease. the most serious risk for public health is a deadly pathogen able to spread through human-to-human transmission with high R0."}
