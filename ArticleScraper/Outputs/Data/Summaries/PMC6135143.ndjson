{"summary": "the legislation was introduced on learning the stories of people who had challenged the courts for permission to end their lives, hearing of those who had gone to Switzerland to access MAID, and talking to colleagues in Belgium. a powerful moment for me was seeing a video of a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Ont, during the SARS outbreak. the most powerful factor in this care is the stories that patients tell us. each story is unique and often describes a long-standing struggle with a dreadful disease or the rapid progression of an aggressive condition. many patients have had end-stage cancer symptoms that were partially managed but faced, to them, an unbearable demise. families are extremely grateful for this care. they are relieved to see how peacefully their loved one dies. they feel a sense of release from their own suffering as they witness the decline. despite the problems, MAID has been an important step forward in end-of-life care for Canadians. despite the problems, MAID has been an important step forward in end-of-life care for Canadians."}
