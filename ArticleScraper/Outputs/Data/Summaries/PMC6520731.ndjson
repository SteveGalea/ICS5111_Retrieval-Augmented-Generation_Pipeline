{"summary": "coVs belong to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus genera. since 2003, coVs including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have swept across the world. the N-terminal domain of the S-glycoprotein is considered to be responsible for the different clinical signs of TGEV and PRCV. previous research has shown that PRCVs are likely derived from an N-terminal amino-acid deletion of the TGEV Spike protein [15,21], but direct evidence obtained from reverse genetics is still needed to confirm this hypothesis. PR/Cas systems have been applied to a wide variety of organisms for the in vivo editing of large genomes. some studies have investigated the in vitro editing of DNA fragments or plasmids [42,43,44]. however, the in vitro editing of RNA virus genomes, particularly viruses with large RNA genomes, using this method has not been reported. cDNA was reverse transcribed with reverse transcriptase (Takara, AMV, Kusatsu, Japan, 6 mer) all the fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phanta Super Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) Fragment A was cloned with the SacI and Van91I sites. fragment E was cloned to contain a SacI site (GAGCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGT) fragment A was cloned to contain a SacI site. fragments A to F were ligated for more than 2 h at 16 \u00b0C and transformed into chemically competent DH10B cells. the correct clone was designated pTGEV-GFP BAC after sequencing. at 48 h post-transfection, collected virus progenies were purified once by fluorescent plaques. the PCR products were then purified with CP buffer (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA) and transcribed using a T7 transcription kit. the purity of the sgRNA products was analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels using 0.5 g of each sgRNA product. PCR products with the 672-bp deletion were constructed by two-cycle PCR. the primers rec-672SF and rec-672SR were used to amplify the primary PCR products. a pair of primers (PrimerF/PrimerR) was designed to amplify the sequence of the modified S_NTD224 area for sequencing. NTD BAC was then recovered as described above. the oligonucleotide primers used to construct and detect the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) S_NTD224 for recombination. in six-well plates were inoculated with 10-fold serially diluted recombinant virus. monolayer cells were washed three times with PBS and overlaid with a mixture of 2% low-melt agarose. the overlay was then solidified at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. the plates were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. five sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and stomach were collected, fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological examination. samples of jejunal contents and lung tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) after necropsy, samples of jejunal contents and lung tissue were collected for virus detection by nested RT-PCR. all the fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phanta Super Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) the natural complete genome of TGEV WH-1 was determined by sequencing (GenScript, Nanjing, China) several site mutations, including T6299C, G11123T, G25943C, C26094T, and C26336G, were observed. Fragment C was cloned into a BAC plasmid that was modified from pBeloBAC11 to include a Van91 site. subclone F contained synthesized essential element sequences, such as the CMV promoter, the poly(A) tail sequence (25A), the HDV RZ sequence (hepatitis delta virus self-cleaving ribozyme sequence, Rz) PK-15 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and incubated for 12 h. the recovery of TGEV-GFP or TGEV-GFP-S_NTD was performed. at 48 h post-transfection, the collected virus progenies were purified once by fluorescent plaques. the purified virus clone was amplified and stored until use at 80 \u00b0C. pTGEV-GFP BAC was digested using targeted sgRNAs. pTGEV-GFP BAC was digested using the targeted sgRNAs. pTGEV-GFP BAC was digested using the targeted sgRNAs. the PCR products with the 672-bp deletion were constructed by two-cycle PCR. primers rec-672SF and S-NTDR or the primers rec-672SR and S-NTDF were used to amplify the primary PCR products. PK-15 cells were infected with TGEV WH-1 or a recombinant virus (TGEV-GFP or TGEV-GFP_S_NTD) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in six-well plates for 1 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the viral titers were determined by TCID50. animal experiments with piglets Thirteen 2-day-old piglets from a TGEV-free sow were randomly divided into three groups and fed fresh liquid milk diluted in warm water every 4 h. all piglets were confirmed to be free of TGEV, PEDV, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) through a RT-PCR assay of piglet feces before viral challenge. six overlapping cDNA fragments designated A to F were cloned into the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to produce the corresponding subclones. subclone F was also constructed as the final recipient BAC vector by inserting the cytomegalovirus promoter at the 5\u2032 terminus of fragment F. pTGEV-GFP BAC was verified by sequencing. fragment F, a 25-bp poly(A) tail, hepatitis delta virus self-cleaving ribozyme sequence, and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) transcriptional terminal signal were inserted into the BAC to form the final recipient BAC vector or subclone F. the left lane is the DL15000 DNA marker, and the right lane is the product of pTGEV-GFP BAC by KpnI digestion. pTGEV-GFP BAC was transfected into PK-15 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. green fluorescence and the cytopathic effect (CPE) could be observed 48 h post-transfection. the mutation of A4553T at nt 4553 was determined by sequencing after performing RT-PCR in triplicate. we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to efficiently manipulate the TGEV gene. two specific enzyme sites encompassing the sequence of S_NTD224 were selected. specific sequence at residues 17-240 were deleted from the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene. pTGEV-GFP BAC digested by Cas9 was detected by electrophoresis. the sequencing of three randomly selected monoclonal colonies also confirmed the positive pTGEV-GFP-S_NTD BAC. we then constructed an infectious clone with the corresponding 224-aa deletion in the N-terminus of the TGEV-GFP S protein. we then constructed an infectious clone with the corresponding 224-aa deletion in the N-terminus of the TGEV-GFP S protein. is detection of recombinant TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD by RT-PCR. we measured the growth kinetics of the wild-type virus, TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. 13 two-day-old piglets were randomly divided into three groups. the piglets were inoculated intranasally and orally at a dose of 1 105 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) the mock-infected control piglets were inoculated with chimeric virus. no chimeric virus was detected in the two piglets in the TGEV-GFP-S_NTD group that were euthanized at 7 days post-inoculation. he staining compared with the normal mock group also revealed that the TGEV-GFP chimeric viruses caused more severe intestinal tissue damage than TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. the piglets in the TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD groups showed obvious colon damage compared with those of the mock group. the piglets showed obvious colon damage compared with those of the mock group. encoding ORF3 at the genome position from 24,826 to 28,580 was replaced by the EGFP gene. the full-length pTGEV-GFP BAC was verified by sequencing. pTGEV-GFP BAC digestion with the KpnI enzyme also confirmed the correct pTGEV-GFP BAC clone. vine growth hormone (BGH) transcriptional terminal signal were inserted into the BAC to form the final recipient BAC vector or subclone F. the EGFP gene replacing open reading frame 3 is noted at 24,826 and 25,692. the left lane is the DL15000 DNA marker, and the right lane is the product of pTGEV-GFP BAC by KpnI digestion. PK-15 cells infected with recombinant viruses TGEV-GFP or parental TGEV or mock infected were visualized at 48 h post-infection. expression of TGEV N protein in PK-15 cells was analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit poly-antiserum against TGEV N protein. mutation of A4553T at nt 4553 was determined by sequencing after performing RT-PCR in triplicate. pTGEV-GFP BAC digested by the nuclease Cas9 digested the pTGEV-GFP BAC in vitro. the digestion yielded a linearized BAC and a 2.1-kb DNA fragment. the specific sequence at residues 17-240 were deleted from the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene. the mutation PCR products were then recombined into the linearized BAC vector cleaved from the full-length pTGEV-GFP BAC. all 10 monoclonal colonies were identified as positive clones by PCR using the primer pair rec-672SF/rec-672SR. we then constructed an infectious clone with the corresponding 224-aa deletion in the N-terminus of the TGEV-GFP S protein. PK-15 cells infected with recombinant virus TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. titer of TGEV-GFP was more than 10-fold greater than that of TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. titer of TGEV-GFP-S_NTD was more than 10-fold greater than that of TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. TGEV-GFP-S_NTD is not the enteric tropism determinant for TGEV. 13 two-day-old piglets were randomly divided into three groups. piglets in each virus-infected group were inoculated intranasally and orally. TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD were detected in intestinal tissue from the moribund piglets. no chimeric virus was detected in the two piglets in the TGEV-GFP-S_NTD group that were euthanized at 7 days post-inoculation. piglets in the TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD groups showed obvious colon damage compared with those of the mock group. more severe villous atrophy was observed in the small intestine, particularly the jejunum and ileum, of the piglets in the TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-S_NTD groups. clone is hampered by two main challenges: large full-length cDNA and toxic sequences in the bacterial clone. the problem of CoV cDNA sequence instability has been overcome by several methods. this study provides the first demonstration of the direct in vitro manipulation of full-length coVs. recombinant coronaviruses were rescued using only one plasmid of BAC in a single week. a simple manipulation of a BAC vector and modification of the specific small region would theoretically lower the mutation probability of the full-length CoV cDNA. this method is not only cost-effective but also reduces the probability of adding additional mutations during the BAC modification procedure. studies have provided direct evidence demonstrating that only the N-terminal region of the Spike gene changes the TGEV virulence or enteric tropism of the virus. to that end, we constructed a recombinant virus with an S protein analogous to that of PRCV (Figure 3A), TGEV-GFP-S_NTD. this recombinant virus showed titers and fluorescent plaque sizes that greatly differ from those of TGEV-GFP. ted RT-PCR indicates that changes in S_NTD224 alone do not alter TGEV enteric tropism in vivo. it is also possible that other genes in addition to the 224 amino acids of the N-terminal of the TGEV Spike protein might regulate changes in TGEV tissue tropism in vivo. mutation fragments can be inserted efficiently into the linearized BAC at the same time. as little as 100 ng of linearized, digested BAC was sufficient to complete the recombination reaction. this method is not only cost-effective but also reduces the probability of introducing additional mutations during the BAC modification procedure. recombinant TGEV has been shown to alter TGEV virulence or enteric tropism. however, a 224-residue deletion in PRCV corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the TGEV S protein is likely responsible for the loss of replication observed in the enteric tract [21] no other studies have provided direct evidence demonstrating that only the N-terminal region of the Spike gene changes the TGEV virulence or enteric tropis piglets euthanized at 7 days post-inoculation may be related to immunity of recovering piglets. the role of S_NTD224 might be similar to that of the 197-amino-acid region in the N-terminus of the PEDV S gene when used as a viral virulence marker."}
