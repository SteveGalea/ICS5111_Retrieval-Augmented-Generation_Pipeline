{"summary": "a large body of research has indicated that seasonal changes in transmission rate are fundamentally important in determining the structure and periodicity of infectious disease time series. the primary source of transmission seasonality for childhood diseases in industrialized countries appears to be the aggregation of children in schools, which are closed between terms and during summer holidays. the highlighted period from 1950 to 1964 displays a strictly biennial epidemic cycle, with large and small epidemics in alternate years. it is common to compare a biennial attractor of a deterministic epidemic model with this observed 2-year cycle. transmission rate reconstructions from other models are shown in figure 3 and in the electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2. the most obvious aspect of reconstructed childhood disease transmission rates is that they decline over the course of the school year [7,10], a feature that is not reproduced by the simple term-time forced SEIR model but is reproduced successfully by age-structured models that employ both term-time forcing and annual gradewise movement of school-age cohorts. incorporating the cohort effect in an epidemiological model is easy without introducing any explicit age structure. incorporating the cohort effect yields simulation time series that fit observed disease incidence data more closely than standard term-time forced SEIR models. a stochastic version was included in a collection of models used to illustrate plug-and-play inference techniques. equations (2.1a)\u2013(2.1c) do not depend on the recovered class R. the basic reproduction number is ([8] and electronic supplementary material, equation (S8)) 2.2 The first factor (B/) does not normally appear in formulae for because it is assumed that B = N is usually absorbed into the transmission rate. instability of the disease-free solution of this non-autonomous model is determined by the condition. we consider fits to the average biennium of the weekly measles reports in E&W from September 1949 to September 1963. the number of biennia was kmax = 9 in E&W, kmax = 10 in London and NYC. the number of biennia was t0 = 1945.688 (8 September 1945) in Liverpool and NYC. in equation (2.8), we used the notation n(t) for the simulated number of cases at time t. EV measures the total deviation of the model's attractor from the observed biennium, relative to the variation in the observed data. all the noise in the data is implicitly assumed to arise from observation error as opposed to process error from intrinsic stochasticity. the \u2018reconstructed\u2019 (t) is the transmission rate that would yield the observed data if the underlying process were exactly a discrete-time SIR model in which the only source of time variation in parameter values is in the transmission rate. the algorithm also \u2018reconstructs' (or perhaps more accurately estimates) the unobserved time series of susceptibles. equation (2.15a) could be used to reconstruct the time series of susceptibles St and transmission rate t. this can be achieved by solving equation (2.15a) for t. the period-doubling bifurcation occurs on the curve marked 1 (red) the other curves are contours of constant major-to-minor-peak-ratio for the biennial attractor (the ratio is marked on each curve; in London, 1950\u20131964) this ratio was approx. 5. instability of the disease-free solution of this non-autonomous model is determined by the condition. we consider fits to the average biennium of the weekly measles reports in E&W from September 1949 to September 1963. t0 = 1949.688 (8 September 1949) in E&W and London, and t0 = 1945.688 (8 September 1945) in Liverpool and NYC. the number of biennia was kmax = 9 in E&W, kmax = 10 in London and NYC, and kmax = 12 in Liverpool. we used the notation n(t; m to emphasize explicitly that the model solution depends on a vector m containing the Np model parameters that are fitted. EV measures the total deviation of the model's attractor from the observed biennium, relative to the variation in the observed data. the \u2018reconstructed\u2019 (t) is the transmission rate that would yield the observed data if the underlying process were exactly a discrete-time SIR model in which the only source of time variation in parameter values is in the transmission rate. the algorithm also \u2018reconstructs' (or perhaps more accurately estimates) the unobserved time series of susceptibles. fine & Clarkson [10] noted that for an observed time series of cases Ct, together with an estimated notification efficiency and initial susceptible proportion S0, equation (2.15) could instead be used to reconstruct the time series of susceptibles St and transmission rate t. this can be achieved by solving equation (2.15a) for t, which yields [19, eqn (4.8)] 2.16. weekly reported measles in Liverpool, UK, from September 1945 to September 1965. monthly reported measles in new york city (NYC), USA, from September 1945 to September 1963. average biennial pattern (Xobs) and variance about it (Vobs) can be written. a given deterministic model yielded an attractor that best fits the observed biennium by minimizing the weighted fitting error 2.9. we used the notation n(t) to emphasize explicitly that the model solution depends on a vector m containing the Np model parameters that are fitted. EV measures the total deviation of the model's attractor from the observed biennium, relative to the variation in the observed data. EV is a scaled and translated version of the negative log likelihood. we compare models via their difference in AIC, so the constant cancels out. fine & Clarkson [10] reconstructed the seasonally varying transmission rate (t) using a discrete-time SIR model. the dynamic equations are 2.15a and 2.15b where t, Bt and Vt denote the transmission rate and numbers of births and vaccinations respectively, in time interval t. the discrete dynamic equations (2.15) can be iterated to produce discrete-time trajectories (St, Ct) [31] we used this method to reconstruct the time series of susceptibles St and transmission rate t. dynamic structure of the cohort-entry model We used standard bifurcation and continuation software (XPPAUT) [51] to construct the diagrams shown in figure 5b,c. figures show that the cause of the annual decline in t is the cohort effect. the effective t obtained by applying the reconstruction algorithm to solutions of the term-time SEIR model shows no decline. without term-time forcing, the effective t reconstructed from solutions of the cohort-entry SEIR model shows decline but (unsurprisingly) no dips during school terms. inset graphs show profiles of EV as a function of, i.e. for each model we find the values of all other free parameters that minimize EV (black); thus, the minimum of the plotted EV profile is the minimum in the full parameter space. figure 4b shows a fit that is just as good, with arising from the fit rather than being specified in advance. incorporating both the school-term and cohort effects yields the best fit (lowest EV), again yielding without fixing in advance. 3.3. Dynamic structure of the cohort-entry model Predictions of structural changes in epidemic patterns depend primarily on qualitative analysis. we therefore consider how the cohort effect influences predictions of bifurcations (e.g. transitions from annual to biennial or more complex dynamics) figure 3 shows the equivalent of figure 2 for the term-time forced SEIR model without age structure, but including the cohort effect as described in 2.2. similar figures in the electronic supplementary material reinforce the inference that the cause of the annual decline in t is the cohort effect. the standard term-time forced SEIR model with forcing amplitude. insets show profiles of EV in black (and the associated minimizing values of and c in blue and green respectively) as a function of. details are given in 3.2 and 2.3. the resulting best fit with this constraint is shown as a dotted red curve in figure 4a. resulting best fit with this constraint is shown as a dotted red curve in figure 4a. the fitted value is substantially higher than the empirical value. in the electronic supplementary material, we repeat our analysis for several other measles incidence time series. a much more elaborate and computationally demanding analysis of fully stochastic implementations of the models also shows that significantly better fits of the detailed time series are achieved by including the cohort-entry effect (AICc is improved by more than 12 units) a cohort effect will influence the population dynamics of childhood infectious diseases. a proportion c of children begins contacting others on the day schools open. the rest enter the well-mixed population when they are born. the global dynamics of the RAS model are, in fact, driven by term-time forcing of the transmission rate, rather than age structure. the decline in the reconstructed (t) arises from the cohort effect, not from age structure per se. the cohort-entry SEIR model that we have examined here is equivalent to the two-age-class limit of the RAS model. we studied the global dynamic structure of the cohort-entry SEIR model. we found that the bifurcation tree is topologically equivalent, regardless of whether transmission rate seasonality is included. the source of seasonal forcing may be irrelevant in the SEIR model. a health and medical research grant from the Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau Research Council (13121382)."}
