{"summary": "all positive strand RNA (+RNA) viruses studied to date have rearranged the membranes of their host cell to create the virus replication organelle (RO) ROs are thought to facilitate the coordination of the processes involved in viral RNA synthesis, as well as provide an enclosed environment to protect viral RNA from detection by the host cell. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have emerged into the human population from zoonotic sources. this has caused significant illnesses with high mortality rates. there are four genera within the coronavirus family, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses. porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was identified in 2012. the virus causes an acute gastrointestinal infection with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and atrophic enteritis. the virus causes an acute gastrointestinal infection with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and atrophic enteritis. cell pellets were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and pelleted. RNA was eluted into 50 L RNAse-free water. PCR was performed using a random primer and 300 ng probe. cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (103.8 TCID50 units/well) at the indicated time points, cells were scraped into PBS and pelleted. the cell pellet was lysed in 1 sample buffer (Biorad Laboratories, Watford, UK) containing -mercaptoethanol, sonicated for 2 min. immunofluorescence LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates on coverslips 24 h prior to use and were used at 70\u201390% confluence. cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (103.3 TCID50 units/well) at indicated timepoints, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% triton X-100 in PBS. the primary antibody specific for BrdU, which also recognizes BrU, was purchased from Roche. anti-N was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 using a Xenon antibody labelling kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma Aldrich), 1% HEPES, 1% NEAA, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic with 2.5\u201310 g/mL trypsin. 80% CPE was visible, cells and culture media were harvested, freeze/thawed twice, and cell debris were pelleted. Western Blot LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into six-well plates. cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV. at indicated time points, cells were scraped into PBS and pelleted. cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (103.8 TCID50 units/well) cells were seeded into 24-well plates on coverslips (2 105 cells/well) 24 h prior to use and were used at 70\u201390% confluence. nascent viral RNA was detected 30 min prior to fixation. cells were treated with 2 mM BrU (Sigma Aldrich) and 15 M ActD (Sigma Aldrich) or DMSO as a vehicle control. all steps following fixation were performed in an RNAse-free environment. data were collected using a FEI Tecnai 12 TEM (FEI, Cambridge, UK) at 100 kV with a TVIPS F214 digital camera. images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop. LLC-PK1 cells were PDCoV-infected or mock-infected. total cell lysate was harvested at the indicated timepoints. titer of progeny virus was determined by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) PDCoV completes virus replication cycle in LLC-PK1 cells. synthesis of new viral RNA and protein occurring between 4 hpi and 6 hpi. release of progeny virions between 8 hpi and 10 hpi. PDCoV-associated dsRNA can be detected from 4 h post-infection (hpi) LLC-PK1 cells were infected or mock-infected. nascent RNA was labelled with 5-bromouridine (BrU) LLC-PK1 cells were infected or mock-infected with PDCoV. nascent viral RNA labelled with BrU was compared to location of PDCoV N protein and an ER marker. puncta appeared to localize near or next to larger N puncta. however, there was no evidence of co-localization between the two signals. sites of PDCoV RNA synthesis were associated with viral N protein. large regions with numerous DMVs were observed. regions of small double-membrane vesicles were interspersed with sections of paired membranes. regions of zippered ER and spherules were most commonly found in the perinuclear region. LLC-PK1 cells were mock-infected (A) or infected with PDCoV (B\u2013F) at 8 hpi, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and processed for transmission electron microscopy. virions in vesicles are indicated with black arrows, DMVs are indicated with white arrows, and regions of zippered ER with spherules are indicated with black brackets. LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PDCoV, and at 6 hpi (A,B) or 24 hpi (C,D), cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde. virions in vesicles are indicated with black arrows, DMVs are indicated with white arrows, and regions of zippered ER with spherules are indicated with black brackets. no significant increase was observed between 10 hpi and 12 hpi. this indicates the synthesis of new viral RNA from 6 hpi onward. RNA was harvested and reverse transcribed to cDNA. PDCoV completes virus replication cycle in LLC-PK1 cells. synthesis of new viral RNA and protein occurring between 4 hpi and 6 hpi. release of progeny virions between 8 hpi and 10 hpi. by 6 hpi, the number of both N and dsRNA puncta had increased. by 8 hpi, the N signal was found throughout the cytoplasm. by 8 hpi, the number of dsRNA puncta also continued to increase from 8 hpi to 24 hpi. PDCoV RNA synthesis was detected from 3 hpi. cells were infected or mock-infected with PDCoV. no BrU signal was detected at 2 hpi. BrU-labelled RNA was only detectable in PDCoV infected cells, not mock-infected cells. the small BrU puncta appeared to localize near or next to larger N puncta. however, there were some N puncta that were not associated with BrU. cells infected with PDCoV or mock-infected were fixed at a range of timepoints post-infection and were embedded and processed for transmission electron microscopy analysis. at this timepoint, virus particles in vesicles were found, either as individual particles per vesicle (Figure 5C) or multiple particles in a single larger vesicle (Figure 5B). PDCoV RO is made up of double-membrane vesicles and zippered ER with double-membrane spherules. cells were mock-infected (A) or infected with PDCoV (B\u2013F) at 8 hpi, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and processed for transmission electron microscopy. zippered ER and zippered ER with double-membrane spherules were present from 6 hpi to 24 hpi. virions in vesicles are indicated with black arrows, spherules are indicated with white arrows. new RNA synthesis was detected from 6 hpi. viral RNA was synthesized by this timepoint. the subsequent release of the progeny virus was detected from 10 hpi. dsRNA localized to the interior of DMVs in MHV infected cells. number of dsRNA puncta increased by 6 hpi, and the puncta became more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. from 8 hpi onward, the N signal predominantly showed a cytoplasmic reticular pattern. it is not surprising that small changes in N levels were less likely to be detected at the population level as determined by western blot. BrU puncta increased and became more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. a small number of ROs was expected at 3 hpi and 4 hpi. however, by 6 hpi, numerous ROs were present throughout large areas of the cytoplasm. nascent viral RNA plays a role in regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. it may appear surprising that ROs do not co-localize with the ER. however, this was not complete, as substantial amounts of viral marker did not localize to the ER. large clusters of DMVs were not associated with zippered ER and spherules. no likely intermediates in DMV formation were observed at any timepoint. the most significant finding from this study is the presence of regions of zippered ER and associated double-membrane spherules."}
