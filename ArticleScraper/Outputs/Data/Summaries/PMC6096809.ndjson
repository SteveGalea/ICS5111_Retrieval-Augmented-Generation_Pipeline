{"summary": "the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Torovirinae) encompasses a range of species with worldwide distribution that infect domestic ungulates. Approximately 55% of cattle within the united kingdom are seropositive for bovine torovirus. coronaviruses and arteriviruses have revealed that they produce negative-sense subgenome-sized RNAs via a mechanism of discontinuous extension (8). this process may resemble homology-assisted copy-choice recombination (10) and requires the presence of multiple copies of a species-specific short motif, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) anti-TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the nascent strand base pairs with the leader TRS within the 5\u2032 UTR. the resulting \u201canti-leader\u201d sequence ranges from 55 to 92 nucleotides (nt) in coronaviruses to 200 nt in arteriviruses. the anti-leader sequence in each of the negative-sense templates then functions as a promoter to drive synthesis of a mirror set of positive-s equine torovirus (EToV) possesses a leader TRS-like sequence (CUUUAGA) but it is only involved in the synthesis of the mRNA used for expression of the spike (S) protein gene (14). despite similarities to the corona- and arteriviral mechanism, the preceding leader sequence incorporated into this mRNA is merely 6 nt in length. ikingly, we identified a small proportion of chimeric transcripts spanning from the leader to the body TRS of the N protein gene. we also identified numerous locations across the genome where noncanonical RdRp template-switching occurs. further analysis confirmed the existence of two novel ORFs in this region, which are conserved in all torovirus genome sequences analyzed to date. viral genome was assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads and confirmed as EToV, Berne isolate. only 18 nt at the 5\u2032 terminus and 300 nt at the 3\u2032 terminus failed to assemble automatically. four single-nucleotide changes were present in all reads. RNA-seq density was adjusted to account for the fact that not all of the RNA-seq density in the 3\u2032 ORFs derives from transcripts from which the ORFs can be expressed. the region covering the HE ORF also has low ribosomal coverage. high RNA-seq density in the 5\u2032 UTR may be indicative of one or more defective interfering (DI) RNAs in the sample. red lines represent total reads per million mapped reads at each position. red lines represent total reads per million reads at each position. a decumulation strategy was used to correct for the fact that the measured RNA density in 3\u2032 ORFs derives from multiple 3\u2032-coterminal transcripts. the majority of Ribo-seq reads were 27 to 29 nt in length, which is consistent with the expected size of mammalian ribosome footprint. a later cycloheximide-treated sample this peak is present. in coding sequences, the 5\u2032 ends of the majority of reads from the host (65 to 81%) and virus (60 to 75%) mapped to the first codon positions. bars are colored by phase relative to the first base of the start codon. bars are colored by phase relative to the first base of the start codon (pink, phase 0; blue, phase +1; yellow, phase 1). a proportion of ribosomes undergo a 1 ribosomal frameshift to translate ORF1b (19) the relative RPF density allowed us to estimate the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting in the context of virus infection. RNA sequencing reads that did not map to either the viral genome or host databases were analyzed for containing potential viral chimeric junctions. between the two replicates combined, 8,330 reads were identified as chimeras, mapping to 2,837 putative junction sites. of these, 213 were considered highly supported by the data. three chimeric junctions were identified where the first nucleotide of the corresponding read mapped to the first nucleotide of the viral genome. of these, one junction was consistent with the previously characterized sgRNA produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis encoding the S gene (280 reads, or 3% of total chimeric reads) chimeric reads spanning from the 5\u2032 UTR to either within the N protein gene or the 3\u2032 UTR were identified. the only junction represented by over 1,000 reads spanned nucleotides 673 to 27649; the second most commonly identified junction, with 642 reads, spanned 687 to 27550. gene expression analysis indicates multiple pathways are perturbed by EToV infection. the RNA-seq data were analyzed to identify genes that were differentially expressed between virus-infected and mock-infected ED cells. we identified 61 genes that were upregulated in virus-infected cells. the five most significant genes in each category are labeled with the gene symbol. no terms were identified for genes significantly more efficiently translated in infected cells. two additional proteins are translated from 5\u2032 CUG-initiated ORFs. negative-sense reads (gray) are displayed below the x axis. a +12-nt offset has been applied to read 5\u2032-end positions to map approximate P-site positions. we have termed these U1 (80 codons) and U2 (258 codons) Graphs show total reads per million mapped reads at each position. panel A densities are smoothed with a 15-nt running mean filter. panels B and C show the RPM counts at single-nucleotide resolution. each plot represents a single replicate. a 3-frame analysis of a full-genome alignment revealed a strong coding signature in the known protein-coding ORFs (as expected) and also in the U1 ORF. the next four panels show an analysis of synonymous site conservation in the concatenated coding ORFs. MLOGD was applied in a 40-codon sliding window (5-codon step size) positive scores indicate that the sequence is likely to be coding in the given reading frame. the bottom panel indicates the total amount of phylogenetic divergence contributing to the analyses at each alignment position. overlapping functional elements are expected to place extra constraints on synonymous site evolution. synplot2 revealed greatly enhanced ORF1a-frame synonymous-site conservation in a region coinciding precisely with the conserved absence of stop codons that defines the U2 ORF. two biological replicates of virus-infected and mock-infected cells were analyzed. for RNA-seq, 77 to 92% of reads mapped to the host genome. a mean of 1.5% mapped to rRNA, 19% to mRNA, 32% to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and 47% elsewhere in the genome. the distribution of reads on the virus genome and the phasing of these reads are shown in Fig. 2. the Ribo-seq/RNA-seq ratio along the genome was calculated. RNA-seq coverage is much higher toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome. ORF1a has a higher Ribo-seq density and a higher translational efficiency than ORF1b. RNA-seq density is similar across ORF1a and ORF1b. the region covering the HE ORF also has low ribosomal coverage. negative-sense reads (gray) are displayed below the x axis for total reads only. each line represents one of the two paired Ribo-seq and RNA-seq replicates. the majority (75%) of Ribo-seq reads were 27 to 29 nt in length. the distribution of read lengths for RNA-seq was much broader. for quality control, histograms of the 5\u2032 end positions of host mRNA Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads relative to initiation and termination codons were constructed. bo-seq data in cycloheximide-treated cells (C) and Ribo-seq data in harringtonine-treated cells (D). bars are colored by phase relative to the first base of the start codon (pink, phase 0; blue, phase +1; yellow, phase 1). bars which extended beyond this point are marked with an asterisk. a proportion of ribosomes undergo a 1 ribosomal frameshift to translate ORF1b (19) this is required to produce a specific ratio of pp1a to pp1ab, thereby controlling the ratio of RNA-synthesizing enzymes to other components of the replicase complex. RNA sequencing reads that did not map to either the viral genome or host databases were analyzed for containing potential viral chimeric junctions. chimeric reads were defined as reads for which the intact read could not be mapped but for which the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends could be uniquely mapped to noncontiguous regions of the EToV genome. junctions that were covered by at least 10 chimeric reads (gray) and/or for which the 5\u2032 section of the read contained the full 5\u2032 leader sequence and leader TRS (red) were identified. the actual 5\u2032-derived sequence is at least 14 nt, ACGUAUCUUUAGAA, comprising the so-called 6-nt leader, the leader TRS CUUUAGA, and an additional A. a second set of transcripts containing 5\u2032 leader sequence was identified by four unique reads starting with the 5\u2032 leader (ACGUAU) and TRS sequence (CUUUAGA) the 5\u2032 UTR preference may be due to genome circularization during negative-sense synthesis, as has been proposed for coronaviruses. these may derive from autonomously replicating defective interfering RNAs rather than multiple independent RNA translocation and reinitiation events. only two genes were found to be translated less efficiently in infected cells than mock-infected cells. these analyses measure changes in individual genes relative to the global mean and do not inform on global changes in host transcription or translation. we repeated the ribosome profiling using infected cells treated with translation inhibitors prior to flash freezing. HAR specifically arrests initiating ribosomes while allowing runoff of elongating ribosomes; conversely, CHX stalls elongating ribosomes while allowing ongoing accumulation. the distance between the U1 CUG, the U2 CUG, and the ORF1a initiation site makes these artifacts unlikely to be significant confounding factors in case of U1 and U2. the distance between the U1 CUG, the U2 CUG, and the ORF1a initiation site makes these artifacts unlikely to be significant confounding factors. dN/dS of 1 indicates selection against nonsynonymous substitutions. dN/dS of 1 indicates selection against nonsynonymous substitutions. dN/dS of 1 indicates selection against nonsynonymous substitutions. the next four panels show an analysis of synonymous site conservation in the concatenated coding ORFs. red lines show the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained. brown lines depict the absolute amount of conservation, as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model (obs/exp) six additional torovirus genome sequences have now become available. we extended the bioinformatics analysis using all eight currently available torovirus genome sequences. the dN/dS analysis is not appropriate for U2. the protein is predicted to contain two central transmembrane domains. the protein is predicted to form alternating helix and antiparallel sheet domains. no structural homologs were found through searches of public databases. conservation of TRSs and regulatory structures in eight publicly available torovirus genomes. regions were selected based on a putative TRS in the EToV genome. predicted hairpin structure (I) is based upon nucleotide conservation across all eight genomes. homologous motif mediating copy-choice recombination-like translocation was actually a short AGAA sequence, not the true TRS. this would result in the nascent anti-TRS mispairing with the leader TRS, where two nucleotides are skipped once reinitiation occurs. this leads to the suggestion that homology between any two sites is sufficient to induce template switching. adenylate is the first nucleotide on all positive-strand subgenomic transcripts (36) initiation of sgRNA transcription at AC dinucleotides is also found in the roniviruses (12) the conserved TRS is used primarily for signaling termination of RNA synthesis followed by promoter recognition. the bafinivirus leader TRS is not fully identical to the body TRSs. it is not known which mechanism was used by the last common ancestor of nidovirids. convergent evolution has resulted in the mechanism for discontinuous negative-strand synthesis arising multiple times within the Nidovirales. some of the identified GO categories, including cytokine signaling, innate immune responses, and ribosome biogenesis, have been identified in previous RNA-seq analyses of various coronaviruses. some of the identified proteins have been recognized as being incorporated into nidovirid virions. the current lack of a published reverse genetics system to study torovirus replication means we are unable to perform targeted mutagenesis. this would enable definitive experimental confirmation that U1 and U2 are translated from their respective CUG codons, followed by phenotypic analysis of knockout mutants. however, the coding sequence contains no AUG codons (in any frame) this region only includes one-third of the U1 ORF. the remainder of U1 and U2 is not under pressure to maintain cis-replication elements. despite the relatively large size of the protein (30 kDa) no structural homologs were identified. an analogous \u201cN + 1\u201d protein has been identified in some group II coronaviruses and is postulated to play a structural role. ribosome profiling nor comparative genomic analysis provides evidence that this ORF is used in toroviruses. the EToV genome contains seven occurrences of the canonical TRS motif (CUUUAGA) the end of U1, central ORF1a, central ORF1b, and immediately before the M, HE, and N ORFs are semiconserved. it is likely that these flanking nucleotides contribute to the degree of utilization. pin, 174 nt upstream of the initiation codon, is involved in stimulating template switching for this sgRNA (14) chimeric junction occurs within the run of uridines 3\u2032-adjacent to the hairpin. this indicates that template switching is prompted by the RdRp encountering this structure. this is in contrast to the coronaviral and arteriviral mechanism. the highly conserved nature of the canonical leader, M, HE, and N TRSs (CUUUAG[A/U]) across all torovirus genomes suggests it is not tolerant to mutations. lack of conservation of the EToV U1, ORF1a, and ORF1b TRS sequences is consistent with them not being functionally relevant. the one bafinivirus has an extended TRS sequence (CA[G/A]CACUAC) which is not conserved with the mammalian toroviruses analyzed in this study. bafinivirus replication produces three sgRNAs which share an identical 42-nt leader also found at the far 5\u2032 terminus of the genome. infection with EToV induces increased transcription of multiple genes. some of the identified proteins have been identified in previous RNA-seq analyses of various coronaviruses. a previous study found that EToV-mediated global inhibition of host protein synthesis was only detectable at 16 h postinfection (h.p.i.) the same study found induction of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was evident only by 24 h.p.i. the ORFs of both U1 and U2 are intact in all torovirus genomic sequences that we have analyzed to date. most of the U2 ORF is constrained by the fact that the sequence must also retain ORF1a coding capacity in another frame. the coronavirus E protein is a small transmembrane protein (10 kDa) it possesses ion channel activity and is required for virion assembly. it is possible that U1 plays a role in toroviruses similar to that of coronaviral and arteriviral E proteins. the development of a torovirus reverse genetics system would allow manipulation of potential template switch-inducing sequences. this would allow us to elucidate which features of the toroviral TRS cause them to act as terminators of RNA synthesis rather than consistently inducing homology-assisted recombination. RNA and ribosomes were harvested according to previously published protocols (17, 58), with minor modifications. rRNA was depleted with the RiboZero [human/mouse/rat] kit (Illumina) both Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads were demultiplexed and adaptor sequences trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit. horse mRNA sequences from EquCab2.0 were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. reads that did not align to any of the aforementioned databases were then mapped to the host gDNA using STAR. reads that did not align to any of the aforementioned databases were then mapped to the host gDNA using STAR. a region overlapping ORF1a was used because only 46 bases are unique to U2. for all ORFs, only Ribo-seq reads mapping to the predominant phase were used. RNA-seq density was calculated for the same regions as those described for Ribo-seq. translation efficiency for each gene was calculated as Ribo-seq density/decumulated RNA-seq density. read length distributions were calculated for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads mapping to positive-sense host mRNA annotated coding DNA sequences (CDSs) or to the positive-sense coding sequence of the EToV genome. the genome sequence was confirmed by de novo assembly of unmapped and vRNA reads from infected RNA-seq samples. the viral contig was aligned to the reference using the MAFFT L-INS-i method (66) RNA structure was predicted using RNA-Alifold (68) and visualized using VARNA (69). read counts were generated across the EquCab2.0 reference genome and annotations (Ensembl release 89) using STAR (64), with a maximum of two mismatches and removal of nonannotated splice junctions. GO annotations for horse genes were downloaded from BiomaRt (Ensembl release 90) (74) Differential translational efficiency analysis was carried out using the CDS counts table. similar to differential transcription analysis, genes to which 10 reads mapped were discarded. PhyML (79) was used to produce a nucleotide phylogenetic tree for the U1 alignment. codon columns of the alignment were randomly resampled. 100 randomized alignments were generated, and their dN/dS values were calculated with codeml. the full-length virus sequence has been deposited in ArrayExpress. a plaque-purified isolate of equine torovirus, Berne strain (isolate P138/72) (EToV) was cultured in equine dermis cells. ED cells were infected with EToV for 1 h in serum-free medium (MOI of 0.1) libraries were prepared and sequenced using the NextSeq500 platform (Illumina) both Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads were demultiplexed and adaptor sequences trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit. reads shorter than 25 nt after trimming were discarded. reads that did not align to any of the aforementioned databases were then mapped to the host gDNA using STAR, version 2.5.4a (64), again allowing a maximum of 2 mismatches per alignment. reads that did not align to any of the aforementioned databases were then mapped to the host gDNA using STAR. reads mapping to the first codons at the 5\u2032 end of each region or the last six codons at the 3\u2032 end of each region were excluded. for sgRNAs, RNA-seq density was calculated for the same regions as those described for Ribo-seq. read length distributions were calculated for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads mapping to positive-sense host mRNA annotated coding DNA sequences. reads mapping to mRNAs with annotated CDSs of 450 nt in length and annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of 60 nt in length. chimeric reads were classified as reads for which the entire read mapped uniquely to the viral genome, with no mismatches. all unmapped reads were split into two subreads at every possible position 12 nt from either end. chimeric reads spanning each donor and acceptor site were calculated as the number of reads which overlapped the site by at least 12 nt. gene level counts were generated across the EquCab2.0 reference genome and annotations (Ensembl release 89) using STAR (64), with a maximum of two mismatches and removal of noncanonical, nonannotated splice junctions. both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq counts were filtered to include only protein-coding genes. dN/dS was estimated using the codeml program in the PAML package. dN/dS was estimated using the codeml program in the PAML package. a codon-respecting alignment of the eight torovirus full-genome sequences was analyzed using a procedure described previously. each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 (80) the sequence contains an intact HE gene. file 2 zjv017183828sd2.xlsx (58.4KB, xlsx)."}
