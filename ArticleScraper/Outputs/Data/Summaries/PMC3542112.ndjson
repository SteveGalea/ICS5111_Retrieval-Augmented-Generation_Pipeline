{"summary": "Approximately 30 percent of all infectious diseases that emerged between 1990 and 2000 were caused by arthropod-borne viruses. this is probably the result of a combination of factors including a dramatic increase in travelling and commercial exchanges. changes in trading and commercial policies have created optimal conditions for the movement of infected vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors. Viruses from the Simbu serogroup have been associated with abortions, stillbirths and malformations in ruminants in Asia, Africa and Oceania. in the literature, there is relatively little information on the diseases (if any) associated with SATV and SHAV infection. the first introduction of SBV in Europe occurred in spring 2011. members of the Orthobunyavirus encode two additional non-structural proteins, NSs and NSm. NSs is encoded by an open reading frame in the S segment overlapping the N gene while NSm is encoded by the M segment as a polyprotein that is co-translationally cleaved into NSm, Gn and Gc. the NSs protein of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) is a non-essential gene product for viral SBV reached titers of 106 PFU/ml at 48 h post-infection and induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in most cell lines with exception of BFAE. we found SBV to replicate very efficiently in sheep CPT-Tert. cells were infected with SBV at a MOI of 0.05 and supernatants were collected at 4, 8, 24 and 48 h post-infection. supernatants were then titrated the rescue plasmids were designed to contain the full-length antigenome RNAs flanked by the T7 promoter immediately upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR and the hepatitis ribozyme followed by T7 terminator sequences immediately downstream of the 3\u2032 UTR. we transfected the 3 antigenome-encoding plasmids in BSR-T7/5 cells, a BHK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses the T7 sSBV rescued in either 293T or BSR-T7/5 cells produced plaques of similar size and shape to SBV. sSBV grew with the same kinetics and reached approximately the same titers of SBV in both sheep. supernatants were collected at the indicated times post-infection. the presence of SBV in CPT-Tert and BFAE cells infected with wild type and rescued virus was confirmed by western blotting using antibodies against the SBV N (nucleocapsid) protein. the sequences of the 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTR of the M and L segments were 100% identical to the predicted sequences used in the rescue plasmids for sSBV. sequences of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of SBV obtained by RACE PCR. the top sequences indicate the sequence of the UTRs of the plasmids used for reverse genetics. the bottom sequences indicate SBV UTRs reported in GenBank (HE649914, HE649913 and HE649912) we inoculated litters of 10 and 18-day old NIH-Swiss mice with sSBV (study 2). we found that SBV infection was lethal for most of the infected mice of these age groups, displaying similar kinetics to the one displayed by SBV infection in newborn mice. histopathology of brains collected at 72 h post-infection revealed bilateral symmetrical vacuolation and loosening of the neuropil of the superficial cerebral cortex and the mesencephalon. in brains collected at 120 h post-infection there was random multifocal vacuolation of the white matter of the cerebrum with small amount of nuclear debris. there was a minimal, multifocal perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes in the adjacent grey arthrogryposis, brachygnatia inferior, torticollis and curvature of the spine were all samples derived from farms in an SBV-endemic area in Germany. we cannot ascertain the time of infection nor the specific SBV strain involved in these cases. clusters of myelin laden macrophages were noted in areas of rarefaction. a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was used in sections shown in panels E, F, I and J. the use of SBV N antiserum reveals a strong positive reaction. no staining was observed with serial sections incubated with the pre-immune serum. NIH-Swiss mice inoculated intracerebrally can be an experimental model of SBV virulence. first, we attempted to attenuate SBV in tissue culture by passaging the virus serially in CPT-Tert cells. after which the virus was plaque purified twice and a stock generated in the same cells reaching a total of 32 passages in tissue culture (virus referred to as SBVp32) nucleotide (antigenome) and amino acid sequences show translation start site of the NSs in an overlapping reading frame within the N gene are indicated (top sequences) bottom sequences indicate silent mutations (low case) introduced in N that abrogate expression of the NSs protein. we inoculated litters of 3 and 7-day old NIH-Swiss mice intracerebrally with either 100 or 400 PFU of sSBV, SBVNSs, SBVp32 or cell culture media as a control. all mice inoculated with sSBV died within 7 days post-inoculation, with exception of the litter of 7-day old mice inoculated with 100 PFU. we detected the presence of foci of virus-infected cells as early as 24 h post-infection in samples derived from mice infected with sSBVp32. in these mice, SBV antigens were widely spread by 48 h post-infection. these results suggest that SBVp32 is able to spread faster than sSBV in the brain of experimentally infected mice. 2fTGH cells were infected with sSBV or SBVNSs and at 24 h post-infection the supernatant was collected and virus UV inactivated. an IFN-protection assay was then performed in CPT-Tert cells, which respond to IFN but are defective for its production. cells were also incubated with a known amount of universal IFN as a control. the presence of IFN- mRNA was investigated by RT-PCR from RNA extracted from 2fGTH cells infected with virus as indicated or transfected with poly IC as a positive control. the quality of the extracted RNA was verified by the amplification of the 45S ribosomal RNA (middle panel), the presence of virus was confirmed. supernatant from sSBV-infected cells did not protect CPT-Tert cells from infection with EMCV. supernatant from ovEC and oTr-1 was found to contain abundant amounts of IFN. to evaluate the role of SBV NSs protein in counteracting the IFN response of the host in vivo, we inoculated litters of 7 day old IFN receptor null mice. sheep CPT-Tert, bovine BFAE, human 293T, dog MDCK and hamster BHK-21 and BSR cells. we found SBV to replicate very efficiently in sheep CPT-Tert, where it induced well-defined plaques of approximately 3 mm in diameter at 72 h post-infection. we used CPT-Tert for all the titrations of SBV performed in this study. the rescue plasmids were designed to contain the full-length antigenome RNAs flanked by the T7 promoter immediately upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR and the hepatitis ribozyme followed by T7 terminator sequences immediately downstream of the 3\u2032 UTR. we transfected the 3 antigenome-encoding plasmids in BSR-T7/5 cells, a BHK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses the T7 sSBV rescued in either 293T or BSR-T7/5 cells produced plaques of similar size and shape to SBV. sSBV grew with the same kinetics and reached approximately the same titers of SBV in both sheep. the presence of SBV in CPT-Tert and BFAE cells infected with wild type and rescued virus was confirmed by western blotting using antibodies against the SBV N (nucleocapsid) protein. we performed 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 RACE PCRs on RNA extracted from SBV-infected cells in order to establish that the sequence of sSBV faithfully represented the wild type field strain. sequences of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of SBV obtained by RACE PCR. the top sequences indicate the sequence of the UTRs of the plasmids used for reverse genetics. the bottom sequences indicate SBV UTRs reported in GenBank. we inoculated litters of 10 and 18-day old NIH-Swiss mice with sSBV (study 2). we found that SBV infection was lethal for most of the infected mice of these age groups, displaying similar kinetics to the one displayed by SBV infection in newborn mice. histopathology of brains collected at 72 h post-infection revealed bilateral symmetrical vacuolation and loosening of the neuropil of the superficial cerebral cortex and the mesencephalon. we found small areas of haemorrhage within large areas of malacia (necrosis of brain tissue) in the cerebral cortex. there was random multifocal vacuolation of the white matter of the cerebrum with small amount of nuclear debris. arthrogryposis, brachygnatia inferior, torticollis and curvature of spine. all samples derived from abortion or stillborn cases. we cannot ascertain the time of infection nor the specific SBV strain involved. the use of SBV N antiserum reveals a strong positive reaction in the cell body and processes of neurons of the grey matter. by immunohistochemistry, we detected SBV predominantly in the cell body and processes of neurons of the grey matter, similarly to what we have observed in mice. NIH-Swiss mice inoculated intracerebrally can be an experimental model of SBV infection. first, we attempted to attenuate SBV in tissue culture by passaging the virus serially in CPT-Tert cells. after which the resulting virus was plaque purified twice and a stock generated in the same cells reaching a total of 32 passages in tissue culture (virus referred to as SBVp32) nucleotide (antigenome) and amino acid sequences show the translation start site of the NSs in an overlapping reading frame within the N gene are indicated. bottom sequences indicate silent mutations introduced in N that abrogate expression of the NSs protein. we inoculated litters of 3 and 7-day old NIH-Swiss mice intracerebrally with either 100 or 400 PFU of sSBV, SBVNSs, SBVp32 or cell culture media as a control. all mice inoculated with sSBV died within 7 days post-inoculation. we detected the presence of foci of virus-infected cells as early as 24 h post-infection. in these mice, SBV antigens were widely spread by 48 h post-infection. in contrast, we first detected virus antigens at 72 h post-infection in brain sections derived from mice infected with sSBVp32. 2fTGH cells were infected with sSBV or SBVNSs. at 24 h post-infection the supernatant was collected and virus UV inactivated. an IFN-protection assay was then performed in CPT-Tert cells. supernatants from cells infected with sSBV did not contain IFN. the induction of IFN- mRNA was investigated by RT-PCR from RNA extracted from 2fTGH cells infected with virus as indicated or transfected with poly IC as a positive control. to control for the presence of residual genomic DNA all the samples were amplified after reverse transcription performed without reverse transcriptase. the presence of virus was confirmed by the amplification of part of the SBV S segment (bottom panel) supernatant from sSBV-infected cells did not protect CPT-Tert cells from infection with EMCV. supernatant from ovEC and oTr-1 was found to contain abundant amounts of IFN. to evaluate the role of SBV NSs protein in counteracting the IFN response, we inoculated litters of 7 day old IFN receptor null mice. the virus was isolated for the first time in Germany in October 2011. the virus probably entered the border region of the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. it then spread rapidly to neighboring countries, including Luxembourg, France, Italy, Spain, Denmark and the united kingdom. both wild type and sSBV were lethal in suckling mice injected intracerebrally. the mice showed a progression from per-acute hemorrhage at 48 h post-infection to malacia at 72 h post-inoculation. the strong immunoreactivity for SBV within the cerebral neurons of mice euthanized as early as 48 h post-inoculation. in sheep the BBB starts to develop between days 50 and 60 of gestation. the disease in adult animals, that have an intact BBB, is mild with no apparent development of lesions in the CNS. newborn mice have a fully mature BBB, however the developing cerebral vessels can be fragile. the NSs protein of SBV acts as a virulence factor. it is unlikely that the attenuation observed for SBVNSs is due to a change in cell tropism. we attribute its attenuated phenotype to its inability to counteract the innate immune response of host. a variety of mutations accumulated in all 3 viral segments. most of the mutations found in the M segment are present in the Gc protein that is exposed in the outer surface of the virion. a mouse model of infection allowed us to identify a viral gene critical for virulence. BSR-T7/5 cells stably expressing the T7 polymerase were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% of tryptose phosphate broth and G418 at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. bovine fetal aorta endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 15% FBS, 1 mM pyruvate, 700 nM of human aortas were placed into collagenase in a petri dish (2 mg/ml in DMEM) after incubation, the endothelial cells were removed by scraping and seeded in 6-well plates. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in large vessel endothelial cell basal medium (TCS cellworks) pUCSBVST7, pUCSBVMT7 and pUCSBVLT7 encode full-length antigenomic S, M and L segments. in each plasmid, the antigenome is placed downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and upstream of the hepatitis ribozyme and the T7 terminator similarly to what described previously for other Bunyaviruses. plasmid expressing the T7 polymerase under control of the promoter was transfected alongside the plasmids containing the SBV antigenomes. in both protocols, cells transfected with only two genomic segments were used as negative control. supernatants were collected 5 days post transfection, clarified by low speed centrifugation and the presence of virus was assessed by standard plaque assays in CPT-Tert cells. the poly-A tailed RNA was reversed transcribed using the oligodT anchor primer. cDNA was then amplified using the anchor primer and a nested gene specific primer. the sequences of the primers used for SBV detection are available on request. CPT-Tert cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 24 h later serial dilutions of the UV-treated media were added. cells were also incubated with 2-fold dilutions of a known amount of universal IFN. cells were then infected with encephalomyocarditis virus and incubated for an additional 48 h. study 4. Litters of 7-day old NIH-Swiss mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 400 PFU with sSBV, SBVp32, or cell culture media. 2 animals per group were euthanized at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection. BV genomic segments have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers JX853179, JX853180, JX853181) all experimental procedures carried out in this study were approved by the ethical committee of the Istituto G. Caporale. cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) primary endothelial cell cultures were isolated by collagenase treatment. aortas were harvested from recently euthanized animals and washed twice in sterile PBS. the aortas were placed into collagenase in a petri dish (2 mg/ml in DMEM) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. pUCSBVST7, pUCSBVMT7 and pUCSBVLT7 encode full-length antigenomic S, M and L segments. pUCSBVST7, pUCSBVMT7 and pUCSBVLT7 were synthesized commercially. pUCSBVNSsT7 was obtained by inserting 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end sequences. pCMV-T7 expresses the T7 polymerase under the control of the early promoter. 293T cells or BSR-T7/5 cells were plated in 6 well plates one day before transfection without in a final volume of 2 ml of tissue culture media without antibiotics. in both protocols, cells transfected with only two genomic segments were used as negative control. 5\u2032 RACE was carried out on the genome strand to obtain the sequence of the 5\u2032 end of the virus segments. Briefly, 1 g total RNA extracted from SBV infected BHK-21 cells was poly-A tailed at the 3\u2032 end of the RNA using poly A polymerase (NEB) cDNA was then amplified using the oligodT anchor primer and a second nested gene specific primer. 2fTGH, OvEC and oTr-1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. they were then infected with the appropriate virus at a MOI of 5, 4 and 2 respectively. the medium was UV-treated for 5 minutes using a Spectrolinker XL-1500 UV crosslinker. NIH-Swiss mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 400 PFU of sSBV, sBVp32, or cell culture media. animals were monitored daily for signs of disease for a period of 14 days. study 3. Litters of 3 and 7-day old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 or 400 PFU with sSBV, SBVp32, or cell culture media. negative controls included brain sections derived from a sheep and 3 calves. tissue sections (4\u20136 m) from mice, lambs and calves were stained with hematoxylin."}
