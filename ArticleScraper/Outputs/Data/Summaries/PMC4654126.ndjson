{"summary": "alphaviruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) include 30 identified viral species. most alphaviruses are transmitted by mosquito vectors to various vertebrate hosts, especially birds, rodents, and primates. many alphaviruses cause disease in vertebrate animals with the potential to emerge into humans or domesticated animals via epidemic and epizootic cycles. the alphavirus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs contain distinct core promoter elements for both minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis. a conserved 51-nucleotide element important for virus replication exists near the start of the coding portion of the non-structural protein 1 gene. alphavirus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs contain non-segmented, single stranded RNA genomes of 11\u201312 kb, with a type 0 cap (N7mGppp) at the 5\u2032 end and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end. alphavirus genomes appear to the host cell as messenger RNA (mRNA) for immediate translation upon entry into the cytoplasm. conserved sequence elements (CSE) can be found in two additional regions of the Sindbis virus (SINV) genome. first, a conserved 51-nucleotide element important for virus replication exists near the start of the coding portion of the non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) gene. this element is dispensable for replication in vertebrate cells, but important for replication in mosquito cells. the 5\u2032 UTRs range in length from 27 (Salmon Alphavirus (SAV) to 85 (Semliki Forest Virus (SFV)) nucleotides, and the 3\u2032 UTRs range from 87 (SAV) to 723 (CHIKV) nucleotides. aquatic alphaviruses without a known arthropod vector contain the shortest UTRs (5\u2032-: 27 nucleotides; 3\u2032-: 87\u2013130 chikungunya virus 3\u2032 UTR has a number of direct repeats (DRs 1, 2, and 3), which occur in lineage-specific patterns. the chikungunya virus 3\u2032 UTR diverged from the east/Central/South African (ECSA) enzootic lineage about 100 years ago. the evolution of the CHIKV 3\u2032 UTR is probably shaped by the fitness trade-offs between mammalian and mosquito hosts. it is not known if the deleterious effect of the longer 3\u2032 UTR for replication in mammalian cells is caused by negative interactions with mammalian host factors. the estimated year of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA: mean and the 95% HPD values) of each clade is labeled left to the node. the 3\u2032 UTR structures are shown next to each lineage. alphaviruses in the Semliki Forest (SF) complex contains the longest UTRs with the greatest diversity in length (5\u2032-: 76\u201385 nucleotides; 3\u2032-: 227\u2013713 nucleotides). the longest complex contains the longest UTRs with the greatest diversity in length (5\u2032-: 76\u201385 nucleotides; 3\u2032-: 78\u2013184 nucleotides). the evolution of the chikungunya virus 3\u2032 UTR is probably shaped by the fitness trade-offs between mammalian and mosquito hosts. the evolution of the CHIKV 3\u2032 UTR is probably shaped by the fitness trade-offs between mammalian and mosquito hosts. cal exchange of the 3\u2032 UTR of ECSA and Asian strain suggested that the fitness of the Asian lineage 3\u2032 UTR is significantly lower than that of its ancestor, the ECSA lineage 3\u2032 UTR, in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. findings suggest that a population bottleneck resulted from a founder effect when CHIKV was introduced into Asia by an infected traveler. sequence alignment, shown next to each lineage, is shown by white blocks. in the Asian lineage, two distinct derived differences are observed: (1) duplication of DR3 and (2) duplication the of DR(1 + 2) region. fitness trade-offs and population bottlenecks likely have contributed to evolution of the CHIKV 3\u2032 UTR. messenger RNA of higher eukaryotes and viruses that utilize cap-dependent translation also contain additional 2\u2032-O-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide to create a Cap 1 structure. alphavirus RNA is translated in a cap-dependent manner, but lacks this additional 2\u2032-O-methylation modification. eIF4E and eIF4F differentially associate with the genomic and subgenomic 5\u2032 UTRs. eIF4G is cleaved by host (caspase-3) or viral proteins. eIF2 is phosphorylated by PKR, leading to global inhibition of mRNA translation. the alphavirus 5\u2032 UTR forms stable secondary structures and mutagenesis studies have shown that both the sequence and structure of the UTR modulates replication. both the sequence and the thermodynamic stability of the 5\u2032 stem structure regulate replication, as mutations that alter the thermodynamic stability of the stem or change the sequence but not the stability of the stem compromise replication. the addition of AU-rich sequences to the 5\u2032 terminus is mediated by the RdRp. the revertants may arise from either the adenylyltransferase or error-prone polymerase activity of nsP4 or synergistic activity of both. despite their conserved features, the 5\u2032 UTRs among alphaviruses form distinct secondary structures, which may affect function and compatibility. 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR incompatibility among different alphaviruses also suggested by replication experiments with VEEV/SINV and EEEV/SINV chimeric viruses. replicase proteins from different alphaviruses lack promiscuity, and may interact differentially with RNA sequences. cytoplasmic viruses generate Cap 1 structures on their mRNA by encoding their own viral 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (e.g., Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, Poxviruses), snatching caps from host mRNA (e.g., Orthomyxoviruses and Bunyaviruses), or utilizing cap-independent translation (e.g., Picornaviruses, Caliciviruses, the structure of the alphavirus 5\u2032 UTR antagonizes the antiviral function of Ifit1 by inhibiting binding to viral RNA. this is an impressive feat for a very short (85 bases or less in different alphaviruses) untranslated region. alphavirus genomic and subgenomic RNAs are modified at the 5\u2032 termini by the addition of a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure (Cap 0), which promotes RNA stability and translation of viral transcripts. in eukaryotic cells, mRNA capping proceeds as follows: RNA triphosphatase cleaves nascent RNA (pppNp-RNA) at the gamma phosphate position to yield messenger RNA of higher eukaryotes and many viruses that utilize cap-dependent translation also contain additional 2\u2032-O-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide to create a Cap 1 structure. however, the 5\u2032 UTR sequence or structure is not reported to modulate the efficiency of alphavirus m7G capping. key host translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4F differ from genomic and subgenomic 5\u2032 UTRs. eIF4G is cleaved by host (caspase-3) or viral proteins. eIF2 is phosphorylated by PKR. alphavirus 5\u2032 UTR forms stable secondary structures and mutagenesis studies have shown that both the sequence and structure of the UTR modulates replication. the AU dinucleotide at the very terminus of the 5\u2032 UTR is required for replication, independent of its ability to base pair. the revertants containing AU-rich sequences may arise from either the adenylyltransferase or error-prone polymerase activity of nsP4 or synergistic activity of both. despite their conserved features, the 5\u2032 UTRs among alphaviruses form distinct secondary structures, which may affect function and compatibility. a single point mutation at nucleotide position 3 compromised virulence in immunocompetent mice. sequence deletions and point mutations at nucleotides 5 and 8 within the 5\u2032 UTR of SINV and analogous point mutations at positions 21, 35, and 42 within the 5\u2032 UTR of SFV also alter pathogenicity. Ifit1 is up-regulated rapidly and to high levels following type I IFN treatment or viral infection. many cytoplasmic viruses generate Cap 1 structures on their mRNA by encoding their own viral 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (e.g., Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, Poxviruses), or utilizing cap-independent translation. ifit1 restricts viral replication, in part, by competing with host translation factors eIF4E and eIF4F for binding to viral RNA. 5\u2032 UTRs of alphavirus RNAs have major roles in promoter function, translational initiation, translational shut-off and avoidance of innate immune mechanisms. a 19-nucleotide CSE at the end of the alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR immediately prior to the poly (A) tail serves as the promoter for negative strand synthesis. the cytosine at 1 nucleotide has been identified as the site of initiation for negative strand synthesis. poly(A) tail functions in conjunction with the CSE to support negative strand synthesis as well as efficient translation. a minimum of 11\u201312 residues in the poly(A) tail is required for efficient production of negative strand RNA. in mammalian cells, the PABP bound to the poly(A) tail interacts with translation initiation factors bound to the cap structure at the 5\u2032 UTR. polyadenylation of newly synthesized cellular mRNA occurs in the nucleus immediately after transcription. for alphaviruses, viral replication occurs in the cytoplasm and separate mechanism exists to polyadenylate the viral RNA. however, subsequent experiments with SINV did not confirm the presence of sufficient poly(U) sequence in the UTR that would promote addition of a poly(A) tail. serial passage of EEEV in BHK cells results in a similar deletion in the 3\u2032 UTR. a 7\u20138 nucleotide seed sequence in the 5\u2032 end of the miRNAs binds to complementary sequences in the 3\u2032 UTR of cellular mRNAs. microRNA expression is regulated transcriptionally in a cell-specific manner. removal of the miR-142-3p binding sites rescues viral translation and replication in myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo. the interaction of miR-142-3p and EEEV demonstrates how a host miRNA can influence viral replication through cellular tropism. three of the four miR-142-3p binding sites in the 3\u2032 UTR have perfect seed sequence matches to miR-142-3p. those with longer UTRs have the potential for a greater number of miRNA binding sites. the presence of highly specific sequences that result in restriction of RNA viruses presents a conundrum, as viruses should readily mutate to eliminate these sites. alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR also has an important role in viral replication and adaptation to new replication environments in mosquito and mammalian cells. deletion of 31\u2013293 nucleotides in SINV reduces viral replication in mosquito cells but not in chicken cells. this region of the 3\u2032 UTR is important for vector infection. a small number of substitution mutations in miR-142-3p binding sites in EEEV markedly affected mosquito replication competence. binding of the cellular HuR protein to high affinity sites in the alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR region impacts both cellular and viral gene expression during infection. most alphaviruses, except CHIKV, o\u2019nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and Ross River virus (RRV) contain a U-rich sequence (40 nucleotides mRNAs that normally rely on HuR protein are destabilized and fail to accumulate. these effects are due primarily to the viral 3\u2032 UTR. presence of large amounts of an alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR in infected cells can cause substantial changes in cellular gene expression that likely impact cellular homeostasis. the poly(A) tail functions in conjunction with the CSE to support negative strand synthesis as well as efficient translation. a minimum of 11\u201312 residues in the poly(A) tail is required for efficient production of negative strand RNA. adaptation to replication in mosquito vectors drives the retention of the RSEs in the 3\u2032 UTR. deletions in the RSEs result in the poor replication of the Asian lineages in mosquito vectors. the 3\u2032 UTR of SINV has no effect on viral replication in chicken embryonic fibroblasts. deletion of 260 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 UTR of EEEV has no effect on viral replication in baby hamster kidney (BHK) or vero cells. miR-142-3p repression minimizes induction of type I IFN and other innate immune effectors. this allows EEEV to replicate essentially undetected by host defense responses. removal of the miR-142-3p binding sites rescues viral translation and replication in myeloid cells in vivo. alphavirus 3\u2032 UTRs range from 77 to 609 nucleotides. only a small fraction of nucleotides including the CSE and HuR binding sites are essential for replication of some alphaviruses in mammalian cells. the interaction of miR-142-3p and EEEV 3\u2032 UTR may not have been identified. therefore down-regulating the activity of miRNA systems in single cell types is unlikely to reveal the complex effects of miRNAs on virus tropism and disease. deletion of 31\u2013293 nucleotides in SINV reduces viral replication in mosquito cells but not in chicken cells. a small number of substitution mutations in miR-142-3p binding sites in EEEV markedly affected mosquito replication competence. weaver and coworkers have proposed that elements in the 3\u2032 UTR can be associated with virus adaptation to new reservoir hosts. the presence of large amounts of an alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR in infected cells can cause substantial changes in cellular gene expression that likely impact cellular homeostasis. the presence of large amounts of an alphavirus 3\u2032 UTR in infected cells can cause substantial changes in cellular gene expression that likely impact cellular homeostasis."}
