{"summary": "recombinant AAVs (rAAV) have emerged as very efficient and potentially non-immunogenic vector candidates for delivering therapeutic genes to a variety of tissues and treating monogenic diseases. as they poorly activate innate immunity and weakly transduce dendritic cells, rAAV appear as far less immunogenic than adenoviral vectors. izing antibodies targeting capsid proteins may also prevent vector readministration. such immune complexes may further sensitize the cellular immune response by enhancing cross-presentation of the transgenic protein by the antigen-presenting cells. developing strategies to circumvent immune responses and facilitate long-term expression of transgenic therapeutic proteins has been identified. CTLA-4/Ig is a potent immunosuppressive fusion protein that reversibly prevents T cell activation. it is now used in the clinic to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. as a second strategy, we turned to immunomodulatory molecules that could protect transduced muscle fibers from immune attacks. AV2/1-PD-L1 or rAAV2/1-PD-L2 were mixed with 1011 vg rAAV-Ova. mice were injected i.p. with 200 g CTLA-4/Ig diluted in 200 l of PBS. lymphocytes from tolerized mice were transferred to conditioned recipients. rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/8 vectors were generated using a standard helper-virus free transient transfection method. sOVA and anti-Ova IgG ELISA Quantification of soluble Ova concentration in serum was performed by Ova-specific ELISA. IgG titers were defined as the dilution yielding the half maximum optical density obtained with control serums. a real-time PCR assay was developed to analyze the quantities of Ova DNA and Ova mRNA present in transduced muscles of treated mice. Absolute amounts of Ova and CD8a amplicons were determined using serial dilutions of pAAV\u2013CMV\u2013OVA plasmid or pTOPO-CD8a plasmid as a standard. the data were expressed as Ova/CD8a ratios, fixed at 1 for PBS-injected control mice. monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and unlabeled anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies were all purchased from eBioscience. Flow cytometry measurements of single cell suspensions derived from lymph nodes, spleen, or blood samples were performed using standard procedures. mice were all between 7 and 10 weeks of age at beginning of experiments. mice back legs were shaved under general anesthesia and titrated 1 1011 vector genomes (vg) rAAV2/1-Ova or rAAV2/8-Ova were injected (50 l in PBS) in the gastrocnemius muscles. cDNA encoding mouse PD-L1 (CD274) or PD-L2 (CD273) were cloned using standard molecular biology procedures and introduced in the SSV9\u2013CAG plasmidic backbone. rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/8 vectors were generated using a standard helper-virus free transfection method. anti-Ova IgG antibodies were detected using biotinylated rabbit anti-Ova antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Abcam) and streptavidin\u2013peroxidase (1:15000, Roche) a real-time PCR assay was developed for quantification of Ova DNA and mRNA present in transduced muscles. 10 l of FastStart Universal SYBR green master mix (Roche) was used in a final volume of 20 l. Ova primers were used at 500 nM and CD8a primers at 400 nM. each qPCR was performed under the following conditions. the same qPCR program as above-described conditions were used. the absolute amount of Ova mRNA for each sample was normalized against the -actin mRNA amount (arbitrary units) the same qPCR program as above-described conditions were used. s were revealed after incubation with anti-mouse IFN detection antibody coupled to biotin. exposure to a ready-to-use solution of nitro-blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3\u2032-indolyphosphate. results were considered statistically significant when the p value was inferior to 0.05 (*), to 0.01(**) or to 0.001 (***) group of four to seven mice were injected with titrated 1 1011 viral genomes. rAAV2/1-Ova and rAAV2/8-Ova injected in the gastrocnemius muscles. both rAAV2/1-Ova and rAAV2/8-Ova were culled at different time points. anti-Ova CD8+ lymphocytes expanded early after AAV challenge. in the lymph nodes draining the injected muscles, anti-Ova CD8+ T cells expanded early after AAV challenge to reach around 2% of the CD8+ compartment at day 7 post-injection. anti-Ova CD8+ T cells were found to reach up to 10% of the total CD8+ subset but only at day 14 after i.m. AAV injection. anti-Ova IgG antibodies may mask Ova epitopes in the immunoassay. i.m. injection of rAAV encoding sOva is strongly immunogenic and provides a mouse model that is suited to stringently evaluate the efficacy of tolerance induction protocols. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 and rAAV2/1-PD-L2 vectors were designed, produced, and tested for their capacity to transduce HEK-293 cells in vitro. a single injection of CTLA-4/Ig dramatically inhibits immune responses and improves transgene persistence at early time points. transient immunosuppression by a single dose of CTLA-4/Ig is very efficient to prevent the priming of anti-Ova CD8+ T cells. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 co-injected with rAAV2/1-PD-L1 failed to provide the same effect on immune priming. local transduction of muscle cells with rAAV2/1-PD-L1 can not interfere with the systemic immune priming against sOva since activation of suppression of immune priming by CTLA-4/Ig promotes the persistence of transduced cells in vivo as measured by the detection of significantly higher levels of Ova DNA and mRNA in the muscles of treated mice. however, injection of rAAV2/1-PD-L1 did not significantly improve transgene persistence. rAAV2/1-Ova in the gastrocnemius muscles was collected at day 0 and received at the same time an immunomodulatory regimen consisting of either 200 g of CTLA-4/Ig alone or the same amount of CTLA-4/Ig together with 1 1011 vg rAAV2/1-PD-L1 or rAAV2/1-PD-L2. we then evaluated the cellular and humoral immune responses at different time points. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 co-administered with CTLA-4/Ig at day 0 significantly improved transgene persistence. mRNA analysis by qRT-PCR at day 80 revealed sustained transcription of the transgene in muscle. rAAV2/1-PD-L2 appeared equally as effective as rAAV2/1-PD-L1 to provide this effect when combined with CTLA-4/Ig. recipient mice receiving lymphocytes from rAAV2/1-Ova injected donors quickly developed an anti-tumor immune response that resulted in complete tumor rejection. cytotoxic activity of transgene product specific T cells that have escaped costimulation blockade can be functionally blocked by AAV-mediated gene transfer of PD-1 ligands in muscle tissues while they remain capable to reject tumor cells. radiated syngenic mice inoculated 1 day after with EG7-bearing EG7 tumor cells. the capacity of transferred lymphocytes to reject the tumors was monitored three times per week. rAAV2/1-Ova and rAAV2/8-Ova injected in the gastrocnemius muscles induced a robust expansion of anti-Ova CD8+ lymphocytes in spleen and draining lymph nodes. anti-Ova CD8+ T cells were found to reach up to 10% of the total CD8+ T cell compartment at day 7 post-injection. the systemic response detected in the spleen would rather reflect systemic immunization directed against the circulating sOva protein after it has been produced by transduced muscle cells. i.m. injection of rAAV encoding sOva is strongly immunogenic and provides a mouse model that is suited to stringently evaluate the efficacy of tolerance induction protocols. transgenic mice express Ova as a neo-autoantigen that tolerant transgenic anti-Ova CD8+ T cells up-regulated PD-1. PD-1 plays a role in induction of tolerance to skeletal muscle-expressed Ag. a single injection of CTLA-4/Ig dramatically inhibits immune responses. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 and rAAV2/1-PD-L2 vectors were designed, produced, and tested for their capacity to transduce HEK-293 cells in vitro. cells were analyzed 3\u20135 days after their transduction with 1/10th dilution of the concentrated virus stocks. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 co-injected with rAAV2/1-Ova failed to provide the same effect on immune priming. this expected result confirmed that local transduction of muscle cells with rAAV2/1-PD-L1 can not interfere with the systemic immune priming against sOva. suppression of immune priming by CTLA-4/Ig promotes the persistence of transduced cells in vivo. CTLA-4/Ig and rAAV2/1-PD-L1 synergistically acts to improve transgene persistence and expression. anti-Ova CD8+ T cell expansion as well as anti-Ova IgG immune responses were readily detectable at day 40. suppression of immune priming by a single dose of CTLA-4/Ig is not sufficient to permanently wipe out the immune responses against transgene product in these experimental conditions. rAAV2/1-PDL-L1 or rAAV2/1-PDL-L2 could synergize with CTLA-4/Ig to improve transgene tolerance. this combined strategy may target two non-redundant mechanisms of immunomodulation acting either on the APC side for CTLA-4/Ig or on target tissue side for rAAV2/1-PD-L1 and rAAV2/1-PDL-L2. rAAV2/1-PD-L1 to provide this protective effect when combined with CTLA-4/Ig. this protective effect occurred in a setting where neither CTLA-4/Ig alone nor the tested combination therapies could block immune response at days 40 and 80. we analyzed the capacity of CD8+ T cells to secrete IFN when stimulated with the Ova-derived immunodominant SIINFEKL peptide. this assay revealed the presence of low numbers of functional anti-O seven mice per group were injected with 1 1011 vg rAAV2/1-Ova in the gastrocnemius muscles at day 0. they were then harvested 80 days after and analyzed for the presence of lymphocytes capable to respond to Ova antigen. the capacity of transferred lymphocytes to reject the tumors was monitored three times per week. a combination immunoregulatory therapy targeting two non-redundant checkpoints of the immune response can promote persistence of transduced target cells and transgene transcription thereof. a first strategy for the blockade of adaptive immunity is obviously to target costimulation pathways and therefore provide an early control on lymphocyte priming. soluble CD80/CD86 ligand CTLA-4/Ig prevents CD28 interaction with CD80 and CD86 molecules on nave and activated T cells. CTLA-4/Ig may also induce a negative signalization on the APC side through the induction of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which catalyses the production of inhibitory kynurenine from tryptophan. CTLA-4/Ig effectively blocks anti-Ova cellular and humoral responses. sustained sOva production finally elicits this undesired response. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has recently been identified as a negative regulator of immunity. PD-1/PD-L1 dependant mechanisms may act synergistically to induce an effective effector T cell blockade. PD-1 engagement on the surface of T cell is known to significantly inhibit TCR signaling thereby preventing T cell activation and cytokine production. PD-L1 expressed in muscle is not effective to block fully activated T cells. this interpretation would be in line with the finding that PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be overcome by CD28 costimulatory ligation in the presence of IL-2. this strengthens the notion that CTLA-4 and PD-1 signaling represent two distinct pathways acting synergistically to maintain tolerance. we show that even after CTLA-4/Ig alone or in combination therapies, an anti-Ova immune response is evidenced in ELISpot assays and in an in vivo model of tumor rejection upon adoptive transfer of T cells in recipient animals. therefore, forced up-regulation of PD-1 ligands in muscle cells yielded a level of protection of transduced cells from the cytotoxic assault."}
