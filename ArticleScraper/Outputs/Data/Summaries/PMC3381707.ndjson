{"summary": "universal coverage embodies a critical underlying social value. the choice of which goods and services are considered essential, the mechanisms by which they would be financed and so on are almost secondary to this basic consensus. inextricably linked to this understanding of universal coverage is therefore an imperative to ensure equity. vulnerability is also created by discrimination, isolation, and human rights violations. the homeless, elderly, refugees and migrants, sex workers, people with mental illnesses, disabilities and chronic illnesses, sexual minorities and the medically uninsured are some groups that experience social vulnerability because of their shared resource and capacity deficits. health systems may also be vulnerable \u2013 at a macro level vulnerability occurs when they are marginalised within political and national priorities. viability of health systems translates into reduced protective resources and poor health outcomes for individuals and groups, and forfeiture of potential national socio-economic gains. the world health report 2010 states that about 20-40% of health spending is wasted. it depends on the democratic freedoms accorded by the political system, a national anti-corruption strategy, robust regulatory frameworks and enforcement by the government."}
