{"summary": "retrospective cross-sectional study involving patients zero to 24 months of age who were hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis was conducted. the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 3.472.99 months. those with rectal temperatures 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) (17) were excluded. urine microscopy and urine culture results were collected. single organism per millilitre (100106 CFU/L) and significant pyuria. the results of the logistic regression analyses are presented as ORs and 95% CIs. all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corporation, USA). RESULTS A total of 857 patients 2 years of age were identified in the medical records. a total of 835 patients met the initial inclusion criteria for clinical bronchiolitis with no urinary tract abnormalities. all children were febrile in the emergency department according to documentation in the patients\u2019 charts. the mean age at diagnosis was 3.472.99 months. 468 (288 boys and 180 girls) had negative urine cultures and 50 (23 boys and 27 girls) had positive urine cultures, and significant pyuria. two of the 50 patients who had a UTI were excluded. being female (OR 1.94 [95% CI 1.09 to 3.49]); P=0.025), older age at diagnosis (OR 2.41 [95% CI 1.29 to 4.51]; P=0.006) and in group 3 (OR= 2.57 [95% CI 1.25 to 5.28]; P=0.002) were significantly associated with an increased risk for UTI. a random-effects meta-analysis of UTI rates was conducted. subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of the study setting (inpatient versus emergency department), study design (prospective versus retrospective) and inclusion criteria. the average rate of UTIs in infants was 3.3% (95% CI 1.9% to 5.7%) the mechanism by which a virus can induce UTIs are not yet known. for example, RVRTPCR is not 100% sensitive (28); therefore, we may have underestimated the rate of UTI in children whose urine sample grew 50106 CFU/L to 100106 CFU/L."}
