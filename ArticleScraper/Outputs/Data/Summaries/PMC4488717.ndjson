{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoV) were first identified and cultivated in the 1960s. of particular medical interest are the virus responsible for the severe acture respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which has caused hundreds of deaths. most CoV E proteins are present at low concentrations in virions [17,18,19,20], with the exception of the E protein in IBV [21]. in MHV and SARS-CoV, E protein is found in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where virions assemble [25,26]. channel activity was shown to be important for inflammasome activation and elevated production of pro-inflammatory IL-1. the latter effects were abolished by introduction of channel inactivating mutations N15A and V25F. a mutant IBV E where the TM domain was replaced. a non-oligomerizing TM domain of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) was defective in release of infectious virus particles. these effects could be due either to a loss of channel activity or the loss of TM domain integrity. channel activity of the T16A mutant disrupted Golgi rearrangement was not measured [35], suggesting a possible link between channel activity and Golgi rearrangement. asn15 is facing the lumen of the channel whereas Val25 is involved in helix-helix interactions with other subunits. mutants that regained fitness and pathogenicity were recovered. revertant mutants that compensated for V25F clustered along the helix interface opposite to Val25. pentameric TM -helical bundle of SARS-CoV E and electrophoretic mobility of truncated E (8\u201365), ETR, TM mutants. mutations resulted in channel inactivation, Val25 (red) and Asn15 (blue) and residues found changed in revertant mutants. the construct ETR, E (8\u201365), which encompasses this motif, has been studied in mixed SDS/DPC micelles [45]. the secondary structure of full length SARS-CoV E protein in lipid bilayers is almost completely -helical. fragment 46\u201360 adopts 100% -structure when studied as a synthetic peptide [44,55], and synthetic peptides inspired in that domain form amyloid fibers [55,56]. fusion proteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G-protein [68] and presynaptic SNAREs [69] may translate a conformational change in the extramembrane domain into local bilayer stress. in both TM domain and C-terminal tail of CoV E proteins there is a high abundance of -branched and bulky residues that can potentially destabilize -helical conformation. the interaction between E and M proteins has long been reported to contribute to M localization and virion formation [23,79,80,81,82,83]. M protein is the most abundant protein component of the virion, and responsible for its shape [84]. this interaction was found to involve PALS1 PDZ domain and the last four C-terminal residues of SARS-CoV E protein, through a X--X- motif, where is a hydrophobic amino acid. PDZ domains are common structural domains of 80\u201390 amino acids found in any organism. the PDZ-binding domains of E proteins may not be restricted to its few C-terminal amino acids. a 12-residue deletion at the C-terminus resulted in a virus with high pathogenicity. papillomavirus and influenza A have been found to enhance pathogenesis. co-expression of SARS CoV E with human epithelial sodium transporter decreased amiloride-sensitive current. ion homeostasis at the Golgi could affect Na+/H+ exchangers. human coronaviruses (HCoV) were first identified and cultivated in the 1960s. of particular medical interest are the virus responsible for the severe acture respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which after 3 years has caused hundreds of deaths. most CoV E proteins are present at low concentrations in virions [17,18,19,20], with the exception of the E protein in IBV [21]. despite their small size, coV E proteins have been found to be critical for pathogenesis. despite their small size, coV E proteins have been found to be critical for pathogenesis. production of pro-inflammatory IL-1 was abolished by introduction of channel inactivating mutations N15A and V25F. a mutant IBV E where the TM domain was replaced with a non-oligomerizing TM domain of ves. the fully conserved Proline in the C-terminal domain is flanked by predicted -sheet structure. icular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) was defective in release of infectious virus particles. these effects could be due either to a loss of channel activity or the loss of TM domain integrity, with subsequent disruption of protein-protein interactions. channel activity of the T16A mutant disrupted Golgi rearrangement was not measured [35]. revertant mutants that regained fitness and pathogenicity were recovered. mutations that compensated for V25F clustered along the helix interface opposite to Val25. revertant mutants that regained fitness and pathogenicity were recovered. helical bundle of SARS-CoV E and electrophoretic mobility of truncated E (8\u201365), ETR, TM mutants. mutations resulted in channel inactivation, Val25 (red) and Asn15 (blue), and residues found changed in revertant mutants (yellow); adapted from [34]. the construct ETR, E (8\u201365), which encompasses this motif, has been studied in mixed SDS/DPC micelles [45]. the secondary structure of full length SARS-CoV E protein in lipid bilayers is almost completely -helical. fragment 46\u201360 adopts 100% -structure when studied as a synthetic peptide [44,55], and synthetic peptides inspired in that domain form amyloid fibers [55,56]. fusion proteins such as influenza hemagglutinin, vesicular stomatitis virus and presynaptic SNAREs may have disrupted protein-protein interactions. in both TM domains and C-terminal tail of CoV E proteins there is a high abundance of -branched and bulky residues that can potentially destabilize -helical conformation. the interaction between coV E and M proteins has long been reported to contribute to M localization and virion formation [23,79,80,81,82,83]. M protein is the most abundant protein component of the virion, and responsible for its shape [84]. PDZ domains are common structural domains of 80\u201390 amino acids found in any organism. more than 150 PDZ domain-containing proteins with over 250 non-redundant PDZ domains have been recognized in the human proteome. some PDZ domains recognize internal peptide fragments [92,93,94] e.g., Par (partitioning defective)-6 PDZ domain can bind to an internal peptide fragment from PALS1 that adopts an extended conformation [92], 93. a yeast-two hybrid campaign using the same C-terminal SARS-CoV E domain discovered another binder, syntenin. the latter is a scaffolding protein that can initiate a signaling cas human papillomavirus and influenza A have been found to enhance pathogenesis through proteins containing PDZ binding motifs. co-expression of SARS CoV E with human epithelial sodium transporter decreased amiloride-sensitive current through activation of PKC and subsequent decrease in ENaC surface levels. hRSV is an enveloped pneumovirus in the paramyxoviridae family. hRSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and elderly. hRSV is the most frequent cause of hospitalization of infants and young children. based on the extracellular domain (C-terminal) of RSV viroporin, the small hydrophobic (SH) protein, has been reported [117], and prevention of nasopulmonary infection in mice caused by RSV has been reported using stapled peptides targeting the fusogenic F-protein 6-helix bundle [118] despite all these efforts, new FDA-approved drugs have yet to emerge. chimpanzees developed significantly less rhinorrhea than wild-type RSV. lack of SH protein leads to attenuated phenotype in children and rats. a recombinant RSV with deletion of the SH gene has been proposed as a live vaccine in calves. hRSV infection led to cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines, producing IL-1. lipid raft disruptors blocked inflammasome activation 145. a suggestion has been made to link inflammasome activation to SH protein channel activity and ion leakage from the Golgi during infection. a description of the full length SH protein monomer has been obtained by solution NMR in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles [126] and in bicelles [148]. the TM -helix extends up to His-51 in the C-terminal region, followed by a loop. the N-terminal cytoplasmic extramembrane domain forms a short -helix (residues 5\u201314), which is present both in micelles and in bicelles. interaction between hRSV SH and G proteins has been reported in infected cells [156,157], although its significance is not yet clear. both G and F proteins have one predicted TM domain, and interaction with SH protein can be both through the TM domain or extramembrane domains. interactions between SH and BAP31 proteins are not known. this could prevent the cleavage of BAP31 and the formation of pro-apoptotic p20. this could in turn delay apoptosis, thus delaying apoptosis. the residues exposed to the cytoplasmic side (yellow) may be actively involved in protein-protein interactions. these cytoplasmic -helices can be used as templates for stapled -helical peptides. a system with intriguing similarities to RSV SH protein is found in the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) peptides mimicking the -helical cytoplasmic domain of SH protein can disrupt the interactions between SH-vDED, leading to enhanced apoptosis and cell death. if the model is confirmed, one can envisage the possibility that stapled peptides mimicking the -helical cytoplasmic domain of SH protein can disrupt the interactions between SH-vDED. hRSV is an enveloped pneumovirus in the paramyxoviridae family. hRSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and elderly. peptides mimic conserved domains of RSV-F protein [107,108], peptides based on F-interacting RhoA GTPase [109], dendrimer-like molecule RFI-641 [110], or other organic compounds [111,112]. despite all these efforts, new FDA-approved drugs have yet to emerge. the small hydrophobic protein is 64 (RSV subgroup A) or 65 (RSV subgroup B) amino acids long, with a single -helical TM domain [125,126]. both A and B subgroups are capable of inducing severe lower respiratory tract disease in humans [127,128,129]. RSV that lacks SH (RSVSH) is still viable, and still forms syncytia. apoptosis induced by PIV5 SH was blocked by neutralizing antibodies against TNF- and TNF- receptor 1 (TNF-R1), but not by an antibody against TNF-R2 [140]. apoptosis was prevented through blockage of the TNF-mediated NF-B pathway. hRSV infection led to cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines. lipid raft disruptors blocked inflammasome activation. similar effects were observed by blocking inflammasome activation. a narrower region [126] in the TM domain is lined with hydrophobic side chains (Ile32, Ile36, Ile40 and Leu44) whereas the more open N-terminal region is lined by polar residues, i.e., His22, Thr25 and Ser29 (Figure 4b). hRSV SH protein sequence is most conserved at the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. hRSV SH protein sequence is most conserved at the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. BAP31 has a cytoplasmic C-terminus that form two coiled coils [162,163], one of them containing a variant of the death effector domain (vDED) [164] flanked by two caspase-8 cleavage sites. this domain is excised upon activation of caspase-8 [165,166] to produce a fragment p20, known to function as a proapoptotic factor [166,167] a stretch of residues in the N-terminal cytoplasmic helix of SH protein was perturbed by addition of the BAP31 vDED domain to full length SH protein in micelles. residues indicated above are not conserved, whereas PIV5 SH protein does not show any homology in this region. keratinocytes is a primary function of the HPV-16 E5 protein. the mechanism of inhibition of TNF- signaling by SH proteins is not clear. a model has been proposed [141] where SH protein interacts directly or indirectly with TNF-R1, blocks TNF- signaling and prevents more TNF- from being produced. a similar strategy could be followed by designing -helical peptides that mimic the cytoplasmically exposed -helical domain in the C-terminal tail of coV E proteins. this effect may be related to a common cytoplasmically oriented membrane-bound -helix, connected to the TM domain by a flexible loop."}
