{"summary": "the nervous system is a target for acute viral infections, as well as a reservoir of latent and persisting viruses. this balance is highly tenuous, as indicated by cases of JC virus-mediated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immunocompromised individuals. senescent immune responses in an increasingly aging population enhance disease susceptibility. ab detection may be more transient in cases of acute encephalitis. it persists during chronic disease such as measles virus-associated subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [17,18]. a specific protective role is often difficult to infer due to difficulties in obtaining longitudinal serum and CSF samples. reliance on local ASC for sustained Ab output provides a potent complement-independent non-lytic mechanism of immune control within the CNS. little is known about the origin and maintenance of ASC in the CNS or other specialized microenvironments. ASC emigration from lymphoid follicles is associated with CXCR5 and CCR7 downregulation. both CXCR3 and CXCR4 are upregulated during ASC differentiation [27,40], with CXCR4\u2013CXCL12 interactions mediating homing to, and retention within, BM [40,41] extrafollicular zone (FZ) B cells in lymph nodes/spleen encounter antigen (Ag), proliferate and migrate to extrafollicular foci or lymphoid follicles. ASC egress into the circulation and give rise to long-lived plasma cells (PC) residing primarily in bone marrow (BM) to serum Ab ratios range from 1:200\u20131:500 in the healthy CNS [53,54], and are only elevated when BBB integrity is compromised. these cells can arise from focal ectopic follicle-like structures within the CNS. a common trait of these infections is the failure of T cells alone to provide sterile immunity. glia-tropic variant of MHV-JHM is designated 2.2v-1. hepatitis is very rare following intracranial infection. hepatitis is very rare following intracranial infection. RNA persists in the CNS up to one year after infection. in humans, SFV causes fever, persistent headaches, myalgia, arthralgia and rare cases of meningoencephalomyelitis. the relative roles of T and B cells in SFV pathogenesis are not as well defined. TMEV primarily infects neurons during the acute phase. but establishes persistence in glial cells and macrophages. role of Ab in anti-viral activity and TMEV persistence remains unresolved. passage of molecules smaller than 4kDa indicates breach of the BBB. breach of the BBB is only modest, as indicated by passage of molecules smaller than 4kDa. reactivity to E2 most potently inhibits virus replication by a complement-independent mechanism. binding of anti-E2 mAb to infected cells also restores membrane potential, host protein synthesis, and type I interferon responsiveness. a potential protective role of TMEV-specific Ab is not well characterized. a potential protective role of TMEV-specific Ab is not well characterized. a potential protective role of TMEV-specific Ab is not well characterized. isolated from the CNS of TMEV-infected mice predominantly secrete Ab specific to viral capsid proteins. ab specific to TMEV capsid protein VP1 cross-reacts with galactocerebroside on myelin and oligodendroglia [105,106]. vASC are detected for at least 90 days after infection, when viral RNA levels are very low. extrafollicularly derived SINV-specific IgM+ ASC are detected in the CNS by day 3 followed by accumulation and enrichment of IgG+ and IgA+ ASC. the early recruitment of IgM+ ASC and local IgM production likely cooperate with IFN--secreting CD8 T cells to eliminate infectious virus. only 30\u201340% of ASC in the CNS 2\u20133 months after TMEV infection are virus specific. the relevance of IgA, normally associated with mucosal immunity, is unclear. the absence of CXCR3 specifically impairs ASC recruitment to the CNS, but not BM [27] recruitment of circulating antibody-secreting cells (ASC) into the CNS is CXCR3 dependent (1). astrocyte-derived CXCL10 mediates ASC entry and parenchymal localization (1 and 2). despite similar migration capacities of ASC to CXCL9 and CXCL10 in vitro, accumulation in the CNS was impaired in CXCL10-deficient, but not CXCL9-deficient mice. the majority of CD19+ B cells infiltrating the SINV-infected CNS also express CCR3 with a smaller proportion expressing CCR5, the receptor for CCL3/CCL5 or CCR7, a receptor for CCL19/CCL2 [120 astrocytes are rarely infected by MHV-JHM [127] suggesting their CXCL10 expression is driven by T cell-derived IFN- rather than infection itself. astrocytes are main CXCL10 producers under inflammatory conditions where IFN- levels are high, irrespective of virus tropism. a role of CD4 T cells during both MHV and SINV persistence is implied by sustained expression of IL-10 and IL-21 cytokines. active in situ proliferation is supported by Ki-67+ and BrdU+ B cells in the CNS of persistently SINV-infected mice [120] ed CNS provides a supportive microenvironment for intrathecal Ab production. virus-induced humoral responses are highly dynamic with early recruitment of naive B cells, as well as IgM+ and IgA+ PB. however, there is little evidence for ectopic lymphoid-like follicle formation. the highly tenuous balance in immune control of persistent viruses is revealed by targeted intervention blocking lymphocyte trafficking in MS patients. future focus on factors regulating B cell differentiation may lead to more efficacious strategies to enhance protective humoral immunity during viral encephalitis."}
