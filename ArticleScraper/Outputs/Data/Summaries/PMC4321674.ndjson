{"summary": "methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become the most common clinically relevant multiresistant pathogen [2] causing both healthcare-associated and community-acquired bloodstream infections with mortality rates up to 40%. prevalence of MRSA is increasing worldwide and can be considered alarming in some European countries, especially in Portugal and Romania. salicylanilides (SALs) date back to the 1940s in therapy of tinea capitis, followed by the discovery of their anthelmintic properties in the mid 1950s [10]. despite being studied since the 1960s, the mechanism of action responsible for biological activities of these compounds has not been explained so far. despite being studied since the 1960s, the mechanism of action responsible for biological activities of these compounds has not been explained so far. the synthesis of the series of novel derivatives of salicylamides, 4- and 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-[1-oxo-1-(phenylamino)alkan-2-yl]benzamides, called diamides due to their skeleton, was described previously [13, 22], and their antimycobacterial and antibacterial activities against various bacterial species were reported [13]. 1f 5-Cl 4-CF3 (S)-CH(CH3)2 4 2 2 2 4 4 8 4 1g 4-Cl 4-Br (S)-CH(CH3)2 8 4 4 16 8 8 8 8 1h 4-Cl 3,4-Cl (S)-benzyl 1 1 0.5 0.5 8 1 8 1 AMP \u2014 >16 >16 >16 0.25 CPX \u2014\u2014 >16 >16 0.5 >16 >16 >16 0.5 VAN \u2014 culture media and antibiotics All media were prepared from dehydrated powders. ampicillin (AMP), ciprofloxacin (CPX) and vancomycin (VAN) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. aliquots (20 L) were subculted from wells with no visible bacterial growth. the plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h for colony count. each MBC assay was performed in at least triplicate on separate occasions. time-kill curves were constructed by plotting the log10 CFU per millilitre versus time (over 24 h), and the change in bacterial concentration was determined. the results were analysed by evaluating the numbers of strains that yielded (log10 CFU/mL) values of 1 (corresponding to 90% killing), 2 (99% killing), and 3 (99.9% killing) at 4, 6, 8, and 24 h compared to counts at 0 h. a 108 bp fragment specific for S. aureus was detected. three clinical isolates were classified as vancomycin-susceptible. the bacteria were stored at 80\u00b0C between experiments. the plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h for colony count. each time-kill assay was performed in at least triplicate on separate occasions. each time-kill assay was performed by the broth macrodilution method. results were analysed by evaluating the number of strains that yielded (log10 CFU/mL) values of 1 (corresponding to 90% killing), 2 (99% killing) and 3 (99.9% killing) at 4, 6, 8, and 24 h compared to counts at 0 h. results and discussion Diamides seem promising candidates for antibacterial agents with very strong anti-MRSA activity. potential bactericidal activity of diamides was assessed using MBC assay. MIC values of all tested compounds were recorded in Table 1. bacterial activity is defined as a ratio of MBC to MIC of 4. antibacterial agents targeting cell wall biosynthesis act as bactericidal agents. failure in cell wall biosynthesis due to inhibition of transglycosylases could be responsible for bactericidal activity of diamides against MRSA. the extent of bacterial killing was estimated by the number of these strains showing a decrease ranging from 1 to 3 log10 CFU/mL in viable cell count at different times after incubation. bactericidal potency of tested diamides against all four strains decreased as follows: 1f > 1h > 1g. a(log10 CFU/mL) values of 1, 2, and 3 log10 CFU/mL correspond to 90% (bacteriostatic), 99% (bacteriostatic) and 99.9% (bactericidal) of killing. the findings of time-kill studies for each of the four staphylococci strains at exposure to compounds 1f, 1g, and 1h are summarized in Table 3.
