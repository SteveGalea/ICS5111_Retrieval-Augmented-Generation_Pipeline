{"summary": "346 SARS cases were officially confirmed in Taiwan. 37 direct SARS deaths and 36 SARS-related deaths were not directly attributed to SARS. the total number of confirmed SARS cases in Taiwan by the end of December 2004 was 480. healthcare workers 2,409 0 3 Others 19,224 6 1 All others 9,514 2 1 Subtotal 55,632 17 7 Level B 95,828 0 0 Total 151,460 17 7 *Updated December 2004. one case-patient had onset of symptoms 2 days after the end of quarantine. 5 cases were deleted from the data of 480 total cases for our comparison test. for the mean time from diagnosis to classification as probable case, we only used the officially confirmed cases for comparison. 344 case-patients (17 quarantined and 327 nonquarantined) were used. the Bureau of national health insurance in northern, central, and southern Taiwan took over the responsibility of case review. the experience and the standard operation procedures of case review and case classification were transferred to the 3 regional SARS expert committees in the Bureau of national health insurance through several consensus meetings. Level A quarantine was implemented on March 18, 2003. most of the quarantined persons were confined to their homes for 10\u201314 days. public health nurses would bring the quarantined persons 3 meals every day. 134 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS either had milder symptoms. one case-patient had onset of symptoms 2 days after the end of quarantine. seven people in this group had been previously quarantined. 2 of these cases were deleted from the data for our comparison test. we used the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. 344 case-patients (17 quarantined and 327 nonquarantined) were used. onset occurred during the 3 periods of February 25\u2013April 27 (period 1), April 28\u2013May 9 (period 2), and May 10\u2013June 15 (period 3). 5 patients were deleted from the data for our comparison test due to missing information on their relevant dates. 2 cases were deleted because classification as probable case-patient did not occur during the 3 periods from February 25 to June 15. onset-to-diagnosis interval (d) Diagnosis- to-classification interval (d) Quarantined persons 1.203 (n = 24) 7.7647 (n = 17) Nonquarantined persons 2.8914 (n = 451)* 7.5443 (n = 327) Mean difference 1.6831 (0.0061) 0.2204 (0.7864) *5 cases deleted because of missing information on the relevant dates. 1 case was deleted because classification as probable case did not occur during the 3 time periods of 2/25\u20136/15. the effect of possible delays in effective isolation of probable case-patients has been studied in some modeling work on SARS (15\u201317) patients with suspected but unconfirmed SARS were kept for days in an emergency room or emergency department under crude isolation. patients scheduled to transfer to another hospital with negative pressure isolation rooms were temporarily kept in the emergency department where nosocomial infections readily occurred. those classified as probable SARS case-patients likely received higher priority. the effect of classification as a probable case-patient might not be as pronounced as it would have been otherwise. for all laboratory-confirmed case-patients, the implementation of full-scale intervention measures, including level B quarantine on April 28, significantly decreased the time from onset to diagnosis. the change in the review and classification procedure initiated on may 10 helped shorten the diagnosis-to-classification time for all SARS patients. no conclusion was drawn regarding whether better outbreak control would be achieved by placing fewer people in quarantine. each area may be improved in efficiency without jeopardizing the other's improvement."}
