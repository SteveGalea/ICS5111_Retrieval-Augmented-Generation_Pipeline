{"summary": "a review of generic methods used to estimate transmissibility parameters during outbreaks was carried out. most methods used the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution. a comparison of the performance of the different methods on simulated datasets is reported. we developed an R package implementing five methods that were most commonly used during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. these methods are \u201cplug-in\u201d methods, requiring only data that are commonly recorded during an outbreak (epidemic curve, serial interval), and have been applied in a variety of situations. reproduction numbers may be estimated at different times during an outbreak. the 'time-dependent' reproduction number may be estimated at any time during an outbreak. proposed extensions and options implemented in the software are also presented. LL R = t = 1 T log e t t t N t N t! where t = R i = 1tNt iwi, the probability must be calculated on a period of exponential growth. the deviance R-squared measure may be used to select the best period. time-dependant method computes reproduction numbers by averaging over all transmission networks compatible with observations. probability pij that case i with onset at time ti was infected by case j with onset at time tj is calculated as p i j = ipij. a function is provided to estimate the serial interval distribution from a sample of observed time intervals between symptom onsets in primary cases and secondary cases by maximum likelihood. a function is also provided to estimate the serial interval distribution from a sample of observed time intervals between symptom onsets. we propose to use the deviance based R-squared statistic to guide this choice. no assumption is made on mixing in the population. the distribution is updated as new data is observed using P R | N 0,..., N t + 1 = P N t + 1 | R, N 0,..., N t P R | N 0,..., N t P R | N 0,..., N t P N 0,..., N t + 1. the method requires that the epidemic is in a period of exponential growth, i.e. it does not account for susceptible depletion. data is provided on a daily basis, i.e. that the time unit is the day. the user may provide incidence data in the following formats: - Vector of dates of onset. an epicurve object from the Epitools package [15] (epitools::epicurve) may also be supplied. all estimates were obtained using the first 32 days of data (default column) or the best fitting time window (\u201coptimal\u201d column) for the SB method, the optimal reported estimate was obtained on day 22 as this date best fits the end of the exponential growth period. the estimate of the reproduction number was 1.56 [ 1.50 ; 1.62 ]. for a large choice of time windows, the estimates of the reproduction number remained within the 95%CI of the best fit, suggesting that the estimate was robust to change in the period of exponential growth. the reproduction number is R = E(I), so that it was possible to calibrate to obtain the desired value of R. all epidemics were simulated over a period corresponding to approximately the 6 first generations of cases (24 days) bias and mean squared error were calculated. ML and TD methods were the least biased. reproduction ratio was increasingly underestimated. 2.45 (5.9935) 0.89 (0.8277) Large overdispersion (k = 4) 1.5 1 0.28 (0.1609) 0.16 (0.0679) 0.33 (0.1913) 0.05 (0.0881) 3 0.11 (0.0715) 0.38 (0.1444) 0.42 (0.1816) 0.06 (0.035) 6 0.08 (0.0694) 0.49 (0.2415) 0.83 (0.6906) 0.04 (0.0574) 2 1 0.13 (0.1109) 0.15 (0.0696) 0. ence data are computed as class of time of infection, defined as tinf(o) = tinf(p) + dlat(p) + runif(1) * dinf (p), where p is the parent case and 0 the offspring case. a generation time distribution typical of influenza is defined. all estimates were obtained using the first 32 days of data (default column) or the best fitting time window (optimal) for the SB method, the optimal reported estimate was obtained on day 22 as this date best fits the end of the exponential growth period. the estimate of the reproduction number was 1.56 [ 1.50 ; 1.62 ]. for a large choice of time windows, the estimates of the reproduction number remained within the 95%CI of the best fit. the variability between estimates was reduced when the \u201cbest fitting\u201d time period was used for the EG and ML method. epidemics were simulated using a branching process, with no restriction on the number of susceptibles to allow exponential growth. for each case, the latent and infectious period were sampled in distributions typical of influenza (gamma distributions with mean+/sd 1.6+/0.3 days for latency and 1+/1 days for infectious period [19] the reproduction ratio was increasingly underestimated as data were aggregated on longer periods. in all cases, the exponential growth method performance was the least affected by either aggregation or over dispersion. 4.000 epidemics were simulated at an individual-based level. for each fixed value of R0, 4.000 epidemics were simulated at an individual-based level. for each fixed value of R0, 4,000 epidemics were simulated at an individual-based level. the reproduction number in an epidemic is of interest when the disease is transmitted between subjects, either directly or indirectly. the methods implemented in the package will best be used for acute diseases with short serial intervals. the analysis of diseases with very long incubation times requires more specialized methods, especially to account for censoring. aggregation in time periods of 1 mean generation time width was ideal for estimation, and corrections proposed for larger time intervals. a second step is to choose a time period that displays exponential growth. too long a time period may depart from true exponential growth downwards, while too short a period may lead to large variance in the estimates. based on the deviance R-squared, a commonly used method to measure goodness of fit of model to data. an implicit assumption in all methods is that all cases are recorded and are linked by a chain of transmission. however, the following issues will arise: missing first cases; under-reporting; unreported cases; reporting delays; importation cases. report delays cause a downward bias in incidence in the last few days of observation. this will impact the most the ML and TD estimates, as these rely more heavily on the fit of the model to the observed incidence. the EG method was the least sensitive to changes in aggregation window, while the ML and TD methods were rapidly inconsistent.
