{"summary": "antibodies targeting Env can neutralize viral particles or mediate different immune responses. ADCC has been associated with decreased HIV-1 transmission and disease progression (1\u20135) internalization of antigen-Ab complexes from the surface of infected cells appears to be a mechanism employed by many viruses to minimize recognition by the immune system. it has been reported previously that the interaction of some Abs with Env glycoproteins expressed on the surfaces of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and feline coronavirus (28)-infected cells accelerates internalization. a panel of antibodies was selected because it can distinguish \"closed\" versus \"open\" trimers. CD4i Abs 17b, N12-i2, A32, and N5-i5 bind epitopes only exposed in the \"open\" trimer. a panel of bNAbs (PGT121, PGT126, PG9, and 2G12) and nNAbs (A32, N5-i5, 17b, and N12-i2) were used to stain the surface of primary CD4+ T cells infected with the NL4.3 GFP ADA virus. bNAbs reduced the cell surface levels of CH58T/F Env by 80% after 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C a panel of bNAbs (PGT121, PGT126, PG9, and 2G12) and nNAbs (A32, N5-i5, 17b, and N12-i2) were used to stain the surfaces of primary CD4+ T cells infected with CH58 T/F virus. it is now well established that the conformation of Env at the cell surface influences antibody binding and ADCC responses. this virus was used to present Env in its CD4-bound \u201copen\u201d conformation at the surfaces of infected cells. deletion of Vpu enhances the overall levels of Env at the cell surface as measured by 2G12. this phenomenon has been well established and is due to the accumulation of BST-2-trapped viral particles at the cell surface. defective for Nef and Vpu expression stained with bNAbs (2G12, PGT126, PGT151, and PG9) (A) or anti-cluster A (A32 and N5-i5) and CoRBS (N12-i2 and 17b) antibodies (B). Statistical significance was tested using an unpaired t test or a Mann-Whitney U test based on statistical normality. 293T cells were transfected with a primary tier 2 Env (JRFL) and incubated 48 h posttransfection. bNAbs 2G12 and PGT151 were internalized much faster than nNAbs 17b and A32. the binding of bNAbs 2G12 and 2G12 did not change the cell surface localization of Env. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HIV-1JRFL Env alone or together with human CD4 receptor to expose CD4i epitopes. Env expressed in the absence of CD4 were visualized with 2G12 and PGT151. bNAb-triggered Env internalization is temperature-dependent manner. cell surface staining of primary CD4+ T cells infected with NL4.3 GFP ADA-based viruses wt (A) or defective for Nef and Vpu expression (Nef-Vpu-) expression (B) is expressed as the percentage of MFI relative to the 0-min time control. Fab fragments fail to induce internalization of bNAb-induced Env. the cross-linking of Env trimers at the cell surface stimulates bNAb-mediated internalization. a dynamin inhibitor attenuates bNAb-induced internalization. the addition of DIP significantly reduced bNAb-induced Env internalization in infected cells. no statistical differences in internalization rates of Env bound by nNAbs were observed. bNAb-mediated Env internalization is dynamin dependent. quantitative significance was tested using an unpaired t test or a Mann-Whitney U test based on statistical normality (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001; ****, P 0.0001) primary CD4+ T cells were infected with the NL4.3 ADA wt virus. 2G12 MAbs in the presence of 50 M DIP or the vehicle control are shown. bNAbs induce Env internalization from the cell surface. 9 anti-Env Abs that recognize different conformations and epitopes of Env. infected cells were identified based on GFP expression (GFP+) cells were first incubated with monoclonal Abs (MAbs) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, washed to remove excess antibody, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for internalization to occur. binding of bNAbs (17b, N12-i2, A32, and N5-i5) was fairly steady. bNAbs reduced the surface levels of CH58T/F Env by 80% after 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. incubation with nNAbs only reduced Env by 20% during same time period. bNAbs were used to stain the surfaces of primary CD4+ T cells. nonneutralizing antibodies and bNAbs target different Env conformations. nonneutralizing antibodies and bNAbs preferentially recognizing Env in its \u201cclosed\u201d conformation (state 1) (36), whereas the nNAbs used here target epitopes that are only exposed upon Env interaction with CD4. the nNAbs tested (A32, 17b, N12-i2 and N5-i5) was dramatically enhanced by deletion of Nef and Vpu. the accessory genes impair the ability of HIV-1 to downregulate CD4 from the cell surface. despite their improved capacity to recognize Env at the surfaces of Nef-Vpu-infected cells, nNAbs only reduced Env from the cell surface by 20% after 6 h. a panel of bNAbs (PGT126, PGT151, PG9, and 2G12) and nNAbs (A32, N5-i5, 17b, and N12-i2) showed a representative staining of infected cells (GFP+) with A32, 17b, PGT126, and 2G12 MAbs over time or with mock-infected cells (gray) 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HIV-1JRFL Env alone or together with human CD4 receptor to expose CD4i epitopes. bNAbs 2G12 and 2G151 were internalized much faster than nNAbs 17b and A32, thus phenocopying the results from T cells. bNAb-induced Env reduction from the cell surface was blocked if cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C. confocal microscopy analysis of antibody-induced internalization. the remaining antibody-Env complexes over different time points are expressed as percentages of the surface fluorescence relative to the 0-min time control. Fab fragments behaved similar to full-length Abs. PG9, PGT151 and 2G12 Fab fragments were significantly less efficient at inducing internalization of Env. a dynamin inhibitor attenuates bNAb-induced Env internalization. primary CD4+ T cells were infected with NL4.3 ADA green fluorescent protein (GFP) or CH58 T/F and dynamin was inhibited with the dynamin inhibitory peptide (DIP) this peptide blocks the binding of dynamin to amphiphysin. fected with either NL4.3 GFP ADA-based virus (A) or CH58 T/F virus (B) were performed with A32, 17b, PGT151, PGT126, PG9, and 2G12 MAbs in the presence or absence of 50 M DIP. quantification of remaining antibody-Env complexes over different time points is expressed as a percentage of MFI relative to the 0-min time control. primary CD4+ T cells isolated from at least three healthy donors were infected with NL4.3 ADA GFP wt virus. their susceptibility to ADCC was measured using a previously described fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assay (9, 47). this suggests that under normal conditions bNAb-mediated Env internalization reduces their capacity to trigger ADCC. bNAb-triggered Env internalization impairs their ability to mediate robust ADCC responses. nNAbs are able to recognize highly conserved epitopes exposed upon the 'opening' of Env. bNAbs can mediate potent ADCC activity against cells presenting Env. complexes accumulated in endosomes positive for early endosome marker EEA1. it is intriguing to speculate that this endocytic pathway could be related to the observed role for recycling endosomes in the incorporation of Env into budding virions. nNAbs that are elicited fail to neutralize viral particles or mediate ADCC against wild type-infected cells. additional work will be required to tease apart the differential contribution of each of these factors in ADCC. plasmids used to transfect 293T cells include pcDNA3.1 human CD4 expressor and pIRES-GFP vector (9, 43). pCAGGS codon-optimized gp160 plasmid was provided by Joseph Sodroski (63) CD4+ T lymphocytes were purified from resting PBMCs by negative selection and activated as previously described. the following anti-Env MAbs were used for confocal microscopy analyses of cell surface staining of 293T-transfected cells. Fab fragments were generated by papain digest of the corresponding antibody. purified IgGs were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight with immobilized papain. cell surface staining was performed as previously described (8, 9). cells infected with HIV-1 primary isolates were identified by intracellular staining of HIV-1 Gag using the Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences) cells were stained with a goat anti-human conjugated with Alexa Fluor-647 secondary Ab (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as a control, cells were fixed after 4\u00b0C incubation (time point, 0 min) Dead cells were excluded by staining the cells with live/dead fixable AquaVivid stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) myristoylated dynamin inhibitory peptide (DIP; Tocris Bioscience) was diluted in water prior to dilution in serum-free cell culture medium. after 1 h of pretreatment of infected or transfected cells with 50 and 40 M DIP, respectively, at 37\u00b0C, fresh inhibitor was added to the cells. as a control, 20 g/ml of biotinylated transferrin was used to confirm the effectiveness of DIP the plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 300 g and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 5 h before being fixed in a 2% PBS-formaldehyde solution. the percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula: % of GFP+ cells in targets plus effectors. images were analyzed manually using ImageJ (65). every data set was tested for statistical normality. significance values are indicated by asterisks in the figures. 293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C. vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped viruses were produced and titrated. anti-HIV-1 gp120 MAbs recognizing CD4-induced epitopes (A32 and 17b; obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and the outer domain (2G12; obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program) were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 Flowthrough fractions were concentrated and further purified by gel filtration chromatography. elution times roughly correlating to 50 kDa were combined and concentrated prior to use. mouse monoclonal EEA1 (14/EEA1) and LAMP1 (H4A3) antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. samples were analyzed on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) data analysis was performed using FlowJo vX.0.7 (Tree Star) antibody-induced internalization assay. 48 h postinfection or posttransfection, HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells or Env-transfected 293T cells, respectively, were incubated with 5 g/ml anti-Env antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. 100 ng of lamin B receptor-CFP plasmid with or without 1 g of human CD4 plasmid using Fugene 6 reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were incubated with prelabeled antibodies diluted 1:250 in fresh medium for the indicated times, washed once with PBS plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were then placed in PBS plus 0.01% sodium azide prior to infected primary CD4+ T cells were stained with AquaVivid viability dye and cell proliferation dye (eFluor670; eBioscience) and used as target cells.
