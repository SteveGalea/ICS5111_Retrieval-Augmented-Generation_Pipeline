{"summary": "certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz, SIVsm) have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species, including humans, resulting in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics. the essential substrates for cross-species transmission, namely SIV sequence diversity, have not been elucidated. two simian immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys are inferred to have been transferred to humans by several independent zoonotic events. over 40 different species of african non-human primates harbor the CD4+ T cell tropic lentiviruses. viral variants obtained from different SMs demonstrate magnitudes of inter-animal viral diversity similar to that observed with different HIV-1 group M subtypes. variations in viral surface proteins of zoonotic viruses are likely key to the ability of these agents to engage new host cell receptors and gain a foothold in new species. adaptive mutations are critical for efficient host-to-host propagation in newly-infected species. but viral diversity that is already extant in reservoir hosts is another important source of the genetic variation necessary for successful cross-species transmission. lentiviruses can adapt to divergent host cellular environments and evade Ab responses. RNA in plasma obtained in 3/99, 5/99, and 5/01 was measured by a real-time RT-PCR assay designed to quantitatively detect the diverse SIVsm variants. multiple V1V2 env clones (range 15\u201329) and p27 gag clones (range 5\u201319) were sampled from each animal at each time point. the translated env aa sequences (FJo, Figure 3; data from all animals can be obtained from THV) showed significant V1V2 heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in numerous predicted N-glyc sites (NXS/T, where X can be any aa but proline) diversity (nt) (Min, Max) St Dev (nt) Length (aa) (Min, Max) # N-glyc sites (Min, Max) FQi 3-99 0.097 (0, 0.21) 0.047 0.051 (0, 0.115) 0.024 142.11 (140, 145) 6.6 (5, 9) 5-99 0.067 (0, 0.13) 0.037 0.033 (0, 0.065) 0.018 141.41 ( 0.020 147.16 (137, 156) 6.6 (5, 8) 5-99 0.118 (0.01, 0.31) 0.047 0.058 (0.003, 0.136) 0.022 146.64 (137, 151) 6.9 (6, 8) 5-01 0.110 (0, 0.21) 0.047 0.053 (0, 0.102) 0.022 147.61 (142, 153) 6.6 (6, 8) FFj 3-99 0.029 (0, 0.08) 0.015 aa diversity was not correlated with viremia, suggesting that mechanisms other than or in addition to the magnitude of virus replication determine the extent of viral diversity. we cannot rule out that reduced diversity in FFj and FDo are the result of infection with less diverse virus populations. dN and dS were calculated at each site and averaged over a 3-codon sliding window for VIV2 or 30-codon sliding window for p27. the same test showed that dS>dN along this gene (t-test, p 0.001), indicating that purifying selection limits its diversity. V1 was consistently found to be under significant positive selection in all animals, except FFj. the average number of N-glyc sites among all animals was 7.2. there was no clear pattern of increased or decreased V1V2 env glycosylation with time. however, the mean number of N-glyc sites for FFj and FDo (7.8 and 8.2) was significantly higher than the other animals. s from proviral DNA representing 9 untreated, chronically HIV-infected humans were compared to our plasma RNA-derived SIVsm env data. two time points were chosen from both the SM and the human dataset so that the interval between observations was approximately 2.5 years. env adapts through raw nt sequence variability, but also through variation in both sequence length and N-glyc site density and position. differences in SIVsm and HIV-1 V1V2 sequence length and N-glyc site density and position will affect the ability of env to utilize different co-receptors. ml plasma fluctuated modestly over the 2-year period. no clinical signs of AIDS were observed in any of the infected SMs. time interval (2 months) and a longer time interval (2 years) exceeds that reported in previous studies of SIV diversity in natural hosts [40-43]. to characterize the overall evolutionary dynamics of natural SIV variation, we built maximum likelihood trees of both env V1V2 (Figure 2A) and gag p27 (Figure 2B) sequences. pairwise distances were calculated using the Gamma distance method. shown are the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum pairwise amino acid and nucleotide diversity and mean, maximum and minimum amino acid sequence length. 0.052 0.063 (0.006, 0.128) 0.026 156.83 (148, 163) 7.9 (6, 10) 5-99 0.076 (0, 0.18) 0.050 0.045 (0, 0.113) 0.028 148.43 (145, 153) 6.1 (6, 7) 5-01 0.160 (0, 0.38) 0.082 0.088 (0, 0.177) 0.041 150.26 (144, 152) the magnitude of nt and aa diversity did not change significantly over the 2-year observation period. animals FFj and FDo exhibiting lower V1V2 nt and aa diversity than FJo and FBo. env sequences at later time points diverged from those sampled earlier. dN and dS were calculated at each site and averaged over a 3-codon sliding window for VIV2 or 30-codon sliding window for p27. dS>0 (p = 0.003, t-test) in V1 (aa's 25\u201355) in all animals, indicating positive selection. aa's 42\u201344, 52\u201354, and 95\u2013107 overlapping consensus motifs are present. overlapping consensus motifs are in particularly diverse regions of V1V2. the average number of N-glyc sites among all animals was 7.2. env aa sequences from proviral DNA representing 9 untreated, chronically HIV-infected humans were compared to our plasma RNA-derived SIVsm env data. two time points were chosen from both the SM and the human dataset so that the interval between observations was approximately 2.5 years. time 1 is in white, time 2 is gray, and circles represent outliers of the distribution. intra-animal env V1V2 sequence length at each time point. SMs are in white and humans are in black. our findings of high intra-host extremes of SIVsm V1V2 nt diversity extend previous studies of naturally infected SMs and african green monkeys. the ranges of aa diversity in some intra-host pairwise SIVsm V1V2 sequence comparisons in this study rival that of inter-animal comparisons. SIVmac239 strain contains 8 predicted glycosylation sequences in the same region. some other macaque-adapted SIVs appear to have fewer N-glyc sites. inverse relationship between N-glyc site density and SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversity might result from more highly glycosylated viral variants being better shielded from diversifying selection pressures. diversity is as great, if not greater than that observed in human immunodeficiency virus infections. the similar levels of viral variation may also indicate that selective forces acting on env V1V2 are comparable in both SIVsm-infected natural mangabey reservoir hosts and in HIV-infected humans. high viral variability and recombination within a natural reservoir host or host population will increase the likelihood that variants with the ability to replicate in new host species exist. the ongoing intra-host diversification of human-adapted RNA viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, enables these viruses to continually respond to changing pressures. plasma from animals FQi, FJo, FFj, FDo, and FBo was obtained on 3-13-99, 5-12-99, and 5-10-01. viral RNA was extracted and quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay designed to quantitatively detect the diverse SIVsmm variants. bp 1493\u20131515 and 19371957 of SIVsmmH4 yielded a 421 bp product of the 5' end of the p27 capsid protein. conditions for each reaction were 30 min. at 50\u00b0C, 15 min. at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min., 52\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. RT-PCR sensitivity was determined to be = 500 copies per reaction non-aligned regions of length variation in V1 and V2 were removed. sequences containing internal stop codons or frame shifts were also excluded from analysis. phylogenetic analysis on sequences obtained from successive time points during acute infection was performed by maximum likelihood using the program Treefinder [88] phylogenetic trees constructed with synonymous or nonsynonymous sites only were constructed in MEGA 2.1 using distance methods. all statistics were computed using SYSTAT 10. random trees of all variants from each animal were generated. individual animals were between 8 and 12 years of age and were estimated to have been infected for approximately 3 to 9 years. plasma from animals FQi, FJo, FFj, FDo, and FBo was obtained on 3-13-99, 5-12-99, and 5-10-01. viral RNA was extracted and quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay. primer pair amplified a 421 bp fragment spanning the V1\u2013V2 hypervariable region of envelope. conditions for each reaction were 30 min. at 50\u00b0C, 15 min. at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min., 52\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. RT-PCR sensitivity was determined to be = 500 copies per reaction. approximately 20 clones from V1V2 and 10 from gag at each time point were randomly selected and sequenced using the dye terminator cycle sequencing method. phylogenetic analyses were aligned using the program CLUSTAL X [83], followed by manual adjustment using MacClade 4.0 [84] and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [85]. rates of nucleotide substitution based on the method of Nei and Gojobori [92] and pairwise amino acid distances were calculated using the modified Nei-Gojobori method in MEGA 2.1 [95]. Phylogenetic trees constructed with synonymous or nonsynonymous sites only were constructed in MEGA 2.1 using distance methods. length variation, alignments of both SIVsm and HIV-1 were pared down to the V1V2 region as defined by the flanking regions of extreme conservation. variance was determined by ANOVA in R [97] for both glycosylation density and sequence length in each species at each time point. authors declare that they have no competing interests. grant T32-AI07442 is a 501(c)(3) charity."}
