{"summary": "ARI is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, affecting young children and the elderly. a wide range of viruses are to be found in ARI presentations to the hospital and outpatient settings 5. the changing landscape of ARI due to the widespread use of conjugated bacterial vaccines could lead to an increased prominence of viral causes 6. the KHDSS area was defined and mapped for demographic surveillance, clinical and epidemiological research by the KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme. it covers an area of 891 km 2, 50 km north and south, and 30 km west, of the KCH. the KHDSS area has 21 public health facilities receiving out-patients. each facility had one or two sampling days per week, usually scheduled from Monday to Friday, between 9.00 am and 1.00 pm. any person present with listed signs and symptoms of ARI would be asked to see the fieldworker for further screening and obtainment of consent. new-borns aged less than 7 days and patients with ARI for more than 30 days excluded. nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was collected from each participant by inserting a sterile nylon-flocked plastic-shafted swab into one nostril to a distance where the tip located in the deep nasopharynx. the sample was stored in universal virus transport media (Copan Diagnostics, USA) and kept at approximately 8\u00b0C in an ice-packed cool box. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 13.1 (College Station, Texas) Summary statistics were produced for the data to give the proportions of virus positives by age and by location. comparison was obtained from the paediatric ward of KCH for patients aged 5 years admitted with acute LRTI. all specimen processing and testing was carried out at KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme laboratories in Kilifi. map of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) area expanded from map of Kenya. out of the 7000 NPS, 1050 (15%), 700 (10%), 490 (7%) and 490 (7%) specimens were positive for rhinoviruses, RSV, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses. the selection of participants each week was on a \u2018first-come first-served\u2019 basis as they presented to the health facility on the set sampling days. samples with cycle threshold (Ct) of 35.0 were defined as positive for the target virus. adenovirus (ADV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) were stored at 80\u00b0C. 41 participants (62.7%) declined with age from 10\u201319 years onwards. symptoms indicative of lower respiratory tract involvement, crackles, chest indrawing and fast breathing for age were uncommon (1.2%, n=65). only 56 participants were recruited in December from all the nine facilities out of the 585 expected per month. 92.6 72.18 1.35 21.25 593 2 P value 0.0001 0.835 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 Age Category 0\u20135 mths 63.48 1.91 1.72 2.29 91.97 78.78 4.21 12.62 523 6\u201311 mths 69.69 0.58 1.16 0.97 95.16 80.66 3.09 10.64 517 12\u201323 mths 74.64 the median age of the virus-positive patients was 2 years (IQR, 1\u20139). the prevalence of respiratory virus detections was higher among young children (5 years) than older children and adults (5 years) Characteristic NPS virus positive(n) % NPS virus negative (n) % Total(n) P value (n=2380) 42.2 (n=3267) 57.8 (n=5647) Age in years Mean 8.2 14.3 11.7 Median (IQR*) 2 (1-9) 5 (1-20) 4 (1-15) Sex Male 1075 45 1314 55 2389 0.0001 Female 1305 40.1 1953 59.9 3258 Age Category0\u20135 mth most common respiratory viruses detected in this study were rhinovirus 18.6% (n=1050), influenza virus 6.9% (n=390), coronavirus 6.8% (n=387), parainfluenza virus 6.6% (n=371), RSV 3.9% (n=219) and adenovirus 2.7% (n=155) the relative proportion of nasopharyngeal swab samples positive across nine health facilities, by virus group, through surveillance of ARI presentations within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Kenya, January to December 2016. the age distribution of detections showed variation between viruses. in 4.4% of the participants (n=246), with 2, 3 and 4 co-infecting viruses detected in n=221, n=19 and n=6 of the participants. the most common antibiotic drugs prescribed were amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. coronavirus OC43 occurred mostly during the months of June to August and E229 at the end of the year. NL63 occurred least in the third quarter of the year. seasonal patterns for parainfluenza viruses and HMPV were difficult to discern. Coronavirus OC43 and parainfluenza virus type 4 were more prevalent in outpatients than inpatients. the distribution of Ct values for each virus target was similar for both inpatient and outpatient samples. the median age was 4 years (interquartile range): 1\u201315 years. children under 5 years of age, and 42.3% (2389) were male. a majority of participants presented with symptoms of cough and nasal discharge. a history of fever was identified in n=3541 participants (62.7%). .41 0.87 5.1 686 Mavueni 68.5 0.78 0.78 1.1 94.2 81.38 5.16 7.82 639 Jaribuni 57.8 0.67 0.5 2.68 97.2 82.58 0.67 6.03 597 Chasimba 53.7 0.97 0.97 0.97 1.46 97.1 72.65 0.16 6.8 618 Junju 64.7 0.33 2.12 3.59 90.2 78.92 0.82 11.27 612 Pingilikani 83 0.0001 0.0001 Virus Target RSV 85.39 2.74 1.37 3.65 95.89 72.6 3.2 13.7 219 Rhino 60.35 1.16 1.26 2.61 94.97 79.79 2.03 10.54 1034 Adeno 82 1 1 0 93 68 1 8 100 Flu 77.9 0 0.85 2.55 97.17 78.47 0.28 7.37 353 Corona 64.62 0 0.36 0.72 96.39 80 respiratory samples from 153 participants were collected. 24.2% (n=37) were children under 5 years of age. 37.9% (n=58) were positive for one or more virus. most common respiratory viruses detected in this study were rhinovirus 18.6% (n=1050), influenza virus 6.9% (n=390), coronavirus 6.8% (n=387), parainfluenza virus 6.6% (n=371), RSV 3.9% (n=219) and adenovirus 2.7% (n=155) ngeal swab samples positive for each of 15 respiratory virus targets for the nine health facilities from ARI surveillance in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Kenya, January to December 2016. the relative proportion of nasopharyngeal swab samples positive across nine health facilities. multiple viruses were detected in 4.4% of participants (n=246), with 2, 3 and 4 co-infecting viruses detected in n=221, n=19 and n=6 of the participants. only 1.4% of participants (n=33) with a virus-positive NPS sample were referred to the KCH for specialized management. influenza type C occurred mostly between March and August. influenza type A was detected most commonly in January, February, November and December. nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from recruits. inpatients with LRTI aged under 5 years were positive for one of the target respiratory viruses. adenovirus was also of high prevalence and significantly more common 12.4% (n=71) than in outpatients 4.4 % (134) OC43, human coronavirus OC43, NL63, human coronavirus NL63, E229, human coronavirus E229, FLUA-FLUC, influenza viruses types A-C, HMPV, human metapneumovirus. we also compare the distribution of viruses associated with respiratory infection among children under 5 years of age. only a small proportion (30%) were in education (mostly kindergarten or primary) this is of interest as the school age groups might be expected to be important agents in the community spread of infectious disease. this raises concern over antimicrobial stewardship, with increased risk of antimicrobial resistance to first-line antibiotic agents and unnecessary use of second-line antibiotics in treating mild acute respiratory disease. adenovirus is the leading cause of severe respiratory illness in 2016. all ARI presentations were recruited and the underlying denominator not recorded. about 40% of the ARI outpatient visits to the Kenyan Coast were associated with respiratory virus infection. ARI is predominant among children 5 years and relatively uncommon among school-going children."}
