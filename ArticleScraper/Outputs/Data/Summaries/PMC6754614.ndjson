significantly higher in H1N1 than in H3N2. the low dN/dS ratios for these 3 genes suggest that they are subject to strong negative selection. a significantly smaller Ne should lead to weaker negative

if a gene shows a high dN/dS in all species, it is likely subject to weaker negative selection than other genes. rule 4: if a gene shows a high dN/dS in all species, it is likely subject to weaker negative selection than other genes. dN/dS can occur in a new population (strain) if it has a small Ne, or if the new locality represents a new niche for the virus. we did not use any of the standard methods for detecting positive selection, such as that of the PAML program package (18), because most of those tests require dN/dS > 1, which is difficult to meet in RNA viruses. ka virus (ZIKV), the dengue virus (WNV), the yellow fever virus (YFV) and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) also show very low dN/dS ratios, ranging from 0.019 to 0.066. only HIV-1 and HIV-2 showed a dN/dS ratio higher than the observed smallest mammalian dN/dS ratio (0.155) in WNV-1, the NS4A gene shows the highest dN/dS among the genes in the genome and among the 8 flaviviruses. we divide WNV-2 into WNV-2

dN/dS ratios, except those for Capsid, prM, and E, are higher in ZIKV Am than in ZIKV A-P, suggesting that ZIKV Am has a smaller Ne than ZIKV A-P. in deNV, the NS2A gene shows strong evidence of positive selection because its dN/dS (0.080) is the highest among all genes in the genome and among all of the flaviviruses in Table 2 in poliovirus 1, 3C and 3D show relatively higher dN/dS values among the genes in the genome and the highest dN/dS among the genes in the same genome. the 3C and 3D genes in enterovirus 71 might have undergone positive selection because their values are significantly higher than those in the other species. 0.017 (0.006) 0.014 (0.002) 0.015 (0.005) 2C (330) 0.020 (0.006) 0.009 (0.003) 0.020 (0.006) 0.011 (0.001) 0.015 (0.005) 3A (81) 0.050 (0.008)

positive selection in H1N1 might have been as frequent as in H3N2. the gene has a significantly lower dN/dS ratio in the strain indicated than that in the other strain. dN/dS ratios tend to be higher in the measles virus than in the mumps virus, suggesting that these genes have undergone positive selection in the measles virus (rule 2). the gene has a significantly lower dN/dS ratio in the species indicated than that in the other species. the gene has a significantly higher dN/dS ratio in the species indicated than that in the other species. the difference could be because more effective drug treatments after 2004 have put a stronger negative selection pressure on the virus. the ratio for the ENV gene is almost 2-fold higher in HIV-1 (1983 to 2004) than in HIV-2. the POL and GAG genes show the lowest and the second lowest dN/dS among the genes in the genome in both HIV-1 and HIV-2. the gene has a significantly lower dN/dS ratio in HIV-2 than those in HIV-1 (1983 to 2004) and HIV-1 (1985 to 2015) was not included in the tests. the extra gene in HIV-1, viral protein X (VPX), is not included. the dN/dS ratios for HTLV-1 suggest that it undergoes much less frequent adaptive evolution than HIV-1 and HIV-2. however, in HTLV-1, the dN/dS ratios for PRO and ENV (0.201 and 0.149 respectively) are considerably higher than those for the other genes in HTLV-1. the method of Nei and Gojobori (36) gave higher dN/dS ratios for mammalian - and -globin genes than the method of goldman and Yang (35). this is because the method of Nei and Gojobori assumes equal likelihoods for dN and dS, so it tends to overestimate dN and underestimate dS. the difference in population size is an important factor for the variation in dN/dS among mammals. dN/dS ratios in Table 1 may be used to infer the relative long-term values of Ne in these mammals. we speculate that one reason for the much larger dN/dS ratios in mammals is that they have a smaller Ne than RNA viruses. WNV-1 NS2A also shows a relatively high dN/dS, but it is lower than those in WNV-2 and DENV NS2A. on average, positive selection has contributed 10% to the dN/dS ratios in flaviviruses. a more rigorous method is needed to estimate the contribution of positive selection to dN/dS. vector-borne RNA viruses have lower dN/dS ratios than non-vector-borne RNA viruses (7). the majority of the strains used to draw this conclusion were flaviviruses. however, many non-vector-borne RNA viruses showed lower or similar ratios as vector-borne RNA viruses. if H3N2 has an 8-fold smaller Ne than the measles virus, this observation implies much more stringent functional constraints on influenza A virus genes except HA and NA. however, the estimate of Ne = 526 for influenza A H3N2 was based on HA gene sequences, so their Ne would be larger. HIV-1 shows an exceptionally high dN/dS, probably because positive selection is prevalent. it is unlikely that this is due entirely to small dS values for the ZIKV Am isolates. a new strain may have recently gone through a severe bottleneck in population size. mutation rate is measured in terms of per cell generation, while evolutionary rate is measured in terms of per year. previous studies did not separate synonymous and nonsynonymous rates. a weak correlation between dN and dS would imply a strong effect of positive selection. dS ranged from 0.101 to 0.412, which is a suitable range for computing dS. it is not clear why the PCC was low for human poliovirus 1 and hepatitis A virus (PCC = 0.38 and 0.29), because the ranges of dS used for these 2 cases were [0.102, 0.489] and [0.102, 0.330], respectively. a substantial fraction of cases show low or no correlation. rotavirus A was selected to represent rotaviruses, HIV-1 group M subtype B was selected to represent HIV-1, and HIV-2 group A was selected to represent HIV-2. for each virus, we first collected the available genome sequences for isolates with a clearly labeled collection year and location (country) for a virus with >1,000 available genomes, we randomly selected only 1 genome per year in 1 country. a genome was considered to have a complete protein-coding gene if we could identify at least 90% of its coding region in the reference genome of the virus. the dN and dS values between each isolate pair were computed for each gene by the Li\u2013Wu\u2013Luo method (34), using MEGA6.0 (46). however, the dS values in Fig. 1 were computed for the entire (concatenated) coding region of each genome because the dS value fluctuates among genes and because the estimate may have a large SE relative to the mean. we first selected a set of isolates with the criterion that all selected genome pairs have a dS 0.05. for each species, we first selected a set of isolates with the criterion that all selected genome pairs have a dS 0.05. this procedure was repeated 5,000 times to obtain an empirical distribution of the number of nonoverlapping pairs we could select. in each round, we estimated the dN, dS, and dN/dS for each protein-coding gene and the entire genome. in each round, we estimated the dN, dS, and dN/dS for each protein-coding gene. variola virus genome length was 164,451 nucleotide sites. the number of synonymous sites is 32,000 according to the Li\u2013Wu\u2013Luo method. for dS = 0.005, the SD of dS is 0.0004, which is much smaller than the mean. the null hypothesis that all genes in G have the same dN/dS ratio is rejected. we identify the smallest j such that the null hypothesis of equal dN/dS ratios for all genes in G1,j = (g1,..., gj) is rejected. we obtain the gene set G1,i = (g1,..., gi) with relatively low dN/dS ratios. rule 2: \"if a gene shows a high dN/dS ratio in a species compared with both the ratios for the other genes in the same genome and the ratios for the same gene in other species, it likely had undergone positive selection in that species\" rule 4: \"if a gene shows a high dN/dS in all species, it is likely subject to weaker negative selection than other genes in the genome\" if a gene shows high dN/dS ratios within the genome and among the species compared, it is not simple to infer if the high dN/dS ratios are due to positive selection or weak negative selection. if the new data again show no significant difference in dN/dS among species, the higher dN/dS ratios in other species would likely be due to positive selection. genome annotation and genome sizes of the viruses under study were obtained from RefSeq (43). for each virus, we first collected the available genome sequences for isolates with a clearly labeled collection year and location (country) an HIV-1 or HIV-2 genome was selected if the sequences of all its genes could be found in the downloaded alignments. for a virus with 1,000 genomes, we randomly selected only 1 genome per year in 1 country. a genome was considered to have a complete protein-coding gene if we could identify at least 90% of its coding region in the reference genome of the virus. we discarded a genome if not all of the genes were found. the isolates in a species were classified into subgroups by constructing a neighbor-joining tree of the isolates in the species using the dS values for the entire genome. for the ZIKV, the WNV, and the HEV, our NJ tree exhibited a clear separation of the american isolates from the non-American isolates. for each of these species, we first selected a set of isolates with the criterion that all selected genome pairs have a dS 0.05. this step is performed to reduce the chance that 2 selected isolates are very closely related to each other. after constructing the set, we selected genome pairs for estimating dS and dN values. for the variola virus, we defined the threshold for set construction as 0.001 and the dS range for collecting a set of genome pairs as [0.01, 0.5]. for the variola virus, we defined the threshold for set construction as 0.001 and the dS range for collecting a set of genome pairs as [0.01, 0.5]. we first collected the 1,000 sets of dN/dS ratios of random pairs of the genes in the same genome. when there are only 2 genes in G, we use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess whether the distribution of the dN/dS ratios is significantly different between the 2 genes. the alternative hypothesis is that the 2 genes have different dN/dS ratios. we obtain the gene set G1,i = (g1,..., gi) with relatively low dN/dS ratios. in this way, we remove the genes in G1,i (Gj,n) with a dN/dS ratio higher (lower) than the average dN/dS for all genes. rule 3 says, \"if a gene shows a high dN/dS in all species, it is likely subject to weaker negative selection than other genes in the genome\" rule 4 says, \"if a gene shows a high dN/dS in all species, it is likely subject to weaker negative selection than other genes in the genome\" if the new data again show no significant difference in dN/dS among species, the higher dN/dS ratios are likely due to weaker negative selection. if the new data again show no significant difference in dN/dS ratios in some species, then the higher dN/dS ratios in other species would likely be due to positive selection."}
