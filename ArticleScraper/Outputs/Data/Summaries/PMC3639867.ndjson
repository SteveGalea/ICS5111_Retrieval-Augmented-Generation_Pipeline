{"summary": "animal models are useful in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis. it is essential to develop new alternative animal models aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human. tree shrews could be a useful alternative mammalian model to study pathogenesis of influenza H1N1 virus. mice, guinea pigs and hamsters models are widely used for influenza virus research. however, they do not exhibit some of the clinical symptoms detected in humans such as nasal exudates. tree shrews (Tupaiabelangeri, family Tupaiidae) are now widely classified as a separate taxonomic group of mammals (Scandentia) that probably diverged from the primate order (Primates) about 85 million years ago. in the 1980s, tree shrews were already being used for animal models for Epstein\u2013Barr virus [17] and rotavirus[18] infection. 9 tree shrews (3/group) were intranasally challenged with 105 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of the H1N1 strains A/PR/8/34, GZ/02/09 and S-OIV/GZ/07/09. control animals were inoculated with an equal volume of uninfected allantoic fluid. a spectrum of histopathological features was found in the lungs of tree shrews infected with each influenza H1N1 virus. evidence of acute bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia were observed in the lungs of all tree shrews infected with each influenza virus. pathological change in trachea of control tree shrew exhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells. tracheal and lung tissue from a control tree shrew had no apparent histological changes. the titer of S-OIV/GZ/07/09 was highest among all strains tested. we detected infectious virus in homogenate of nasal mucosa with logTCID50/mL value ranging from 1.89 to 2.17. no virus was found in trachea and lung. in the nasal mucosa, only a few SA2,3 Gal receptor were detected on squamous epithelial cells. the receptor was mostly detected in the pseudostratified ciliated cells of the trachea. in lung tissue, the non-ciliated cuboidal epithelium of the terminal bronchioles mainly expressed SA2,6 Gal. avian influenza virus receptor SA2,3 Gal binding with MAA II and human influenza virus receptor SA 2,6 Gal binding with SNA are shown in brown. only a few of MAA staining was visible on almost all epithelial cells. all tree shrews were observed to be clinically normal signs on day 0. Clinical signs of infection were initially observed on day 1 post-infection (p.i.), with most animals exhibiting signs by day 3 or 4 p.i. and gradually disappeared by day 9 p.i. e Virus titers in different tissues were detected on day 2 p.i. f Serum was collected on day 14 p.i. homologous strains were used with chicken RBCs in HI assay. titer of s-OIV/GZ/07/09 was highest among all strains tested. virus grew to peak titers on day 1 or day2 p.i. and dropped to undetectable levels by day 4 p.i. tree shrews were intranasally inoculated with 105 TICID50 of virus. tree shrews were seronegative for influenza A viruses (H1N1) using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. the distribution of SA2,6 Gal was mainly detected in the trachea and bronchus. only sporadic expression of SA2,3Gal was observed in the tracheal, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. stained SNA staining was visible on almost all epithelial cells (E) only a few of MAA staining was visible on squamous epithelial cells (E) a few stains of SA 2,3 Gal were found (). a few stains of SA 2,3 Gal were found (). tree shrews usually had fever after inoculation with high challenge dose of influenza virus, and dropped to undetectable levels by around one week. both of systemic and respiratory symptoms were characteristically observed in tree shrews infected. however, loss appetite, congested eyes and otologic manifestation were not observed in tree shrews, but in ferrets. tree shrews inoculated with human influenza viruses demonstrated a primarily upper respiratory tract infection. influenza viruses could be isolated at high titers from nasal washes, but no virus could be detected in tracheas and lungs. tree shrews are widely used in medical and biological research, especially in virology. but tree shrews, used as experimental animals, need a suitable source for this study. compared to ferrets, tree shrews can be bred more easily. pharmacokinetics in tree shrews and humans may limit the study of antiviral treatment. further efforts are needed to determine its pathogenesis in tree shrew model. the model will be useful for assessment of circulating strains that could challenge human public health. human primates were seronegative by HA inhibition assay to influenza A/PR/8/34, A/Guangzhou/GIRD/02/09 and A/Guangzhou/GIRD/07/09 human H1N1virus isolates. each animal was lightly anesthetized with a solution of ketamine/xylazine/atropine. clinical signs of infection and bodyweight and temperature were recorded daily. nasal wash samples containing 0.3 mL PBS with antibiotic were collected from all tree shrews on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 for viral titration using the TCID50 assay. samples were placed on dry ice immediately after collection. paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide methanol to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. each slide of tissue sections was covered with 10 U/l neuraminidase. biotinylated MAA II, which is specific for -2,3-linked SA, was purchased from Vector Laboratories. biotinylatedlectin binding was visualized using a DAB substrate chromogene kit (Maixin, Fuzhou, China) slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. swine influenza virus was obtained from unadapted H1N1 human clinical isolate before 2009 influenza pandemic. laboratory animals (2010) and guidelines on the welfare of non-human primates were used in research. animals were allowed free access to food and water and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. animals were monitored daily for evidence of disease and changes in attitude, appetite, or behavior suggestive of illness. the tissues were weighed and homogenized to make a 10% weight by volume (w/v) suspension for virus titration on MDCK cells using the TCID50 assay. samples were made into aliquots and placed on dry ice immediately after collection. paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide methanol to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. each slide of tissue sections was covered with 10 U/l neuraminidase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. all tissue sections were incubated in ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase streptavidin buffer for 30 min. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."}
