{"summary": "fecal samples were collected from 10 different species of wild carnivores. a number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected. detected novel viruses highlight the viral diversity present in fecal material of wild carnivores. a systematic exploration of viruses present in several key host species of wild animals might provide important information to find the original host or carriers of viruses. information about the presence of viruses in healthy hosts provides a baseline level for viruses present in these animals in case an outbreak of disease occurs. sequences of the order Caudovirales were detected. in 26 out of 42 samples, sequences were detected that had the closest similarity to viruses known to infect eukaryotes. sequences were detected that had the closest similarity to viruses previously detected in birds and rodents. antibodies to Aleutian mink disease parvovirus have been detected in a cohort of free-ranging European mink in southwestern france and northern Spain. additional sampling and confirmation by specific PCR is necessary to confirm that the Aleutian mink disease parvovirus is circulating among these animals. sequences of potentially novel viruses or virus variants, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and pic Observations 1 Analyzed 2 Reads Detected viral

RNA viruses. genus Cardiovirus of the family Picornaviridae currently consists of two species, Theilovirus and Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) genet fecal theilovirus (GFTV; Genbank accession KF823815) was analyzed by designing primers based on the obtained sequence reads and the partial sequence (6488 nt) of a novel theilovirus. despite various attempts using degenerate primers and 3\u2019 RACE PCRs, no more sequences could be obtained of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 end. the genet fecal theilovirus sequence was based on an alternative initiation codon 13 nt downstream of the authentic initiation codon. this indicates that the L* protein previously observed in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyocarditis virus is also present in this novel virus. novel phleboviruses in feces of a red fox and an eurasian otter Bunyavirus are segmented, negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses. at present the ICTV has recognized five different genera, Orthobunyavirus, Hantavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, and Tospovirus[22]. gene (S segment) and partial glycoprotein (G) gene (M segment) of another novel phlebovirus, tentatively called Red fox fecal phlebovirus (NP gene: 606 nt, covered by 33 reads, G gene: 1110 nt, covered by 63 reads, Genbank accessions KF823818 and KF823819) were identified. pairwise identity and phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino fox fecal phlebovirus using Gouleako virus as a reference. bootstrap replicates of the deduced amino acid sequence of the partial glycoprotein gene (C) and nucleoprotein gene (D) of red fox and Otter fecal phlebovirus. fox sample 40, 11 sequences were detected that had the closest similarity to viruses belonging to the genus Amdovirus. sequences of two partial ORFs (left ORF, putative non-structural gene 1 and 5\u2019 end; 633 nt and right ORF, putative viral protein 2; 830 nt, Genbank accessions KF823809 and KF823808) were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. kobuviruses were detected in enteric samples from humans, cows and pigs respectively. kobuvirus sequences detected in a common genet were similar to kobuviruses detected in mice and sewage. kobuvirus sequences detected in the common genet were nearly identical to kobuviruses detected in healthy and diarrheic dogs. phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree with p-distance and 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the nucleotide sequence of the partial 3D gene of Red fox fecal kobuvirus. indicated are Genbank accession numbers and bootstrap values. obtained sequences of the RdRp gene were most closely related to picobirnaviruses detected previously in rodents and otarines. phylogenetic analysis of Genet fecal picobirnavirus and Red fox fecal picobirnavirus S40-1 and S40-2. the presence and detection of the obtained viral sequences is potentially biased by multiple factors, including ecological factors, virus concentrations, a PCR bias, bioinformatics analysis bias and possible contamination of laboratory kits. a number of species evaluated in the present study have been the focus of previous viral metagenomics studies in the Netherlands [9,14]. sequences of the order Caudovirales were detected in 26 out of 42 samples. a proportion of the detected viral sequences had the closest similarity to viruses previously detected in birds and rodents. a proportion of the detected viral sequences had the closest similarity to

(Vulpes vulpes) 08/01/2013 fd RS 5163 genet fecal theilovirus Picornaviruses are small, positive-stranded non-enveloped RNA viruses. this large family was subdivided into several genera. the genus Cardiovirus of the family Picornaviridae currently consists of two species. genet fecal theilovirus belongs to a novel genotype, with maximum pairwise identities on the nucleotide (and deduced amino acid) level of respectively 69 (70), 63 (68), 62 (65) and 82 (65)%. no more sequences could be obtained of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 end, possibly due to low virus genome copy numbers present in the original material. the novel genet fecal theilovirus has not caused any significant disease. further research needs to be performed to elucidate whether the detected virus is derived from the prey species of this animal. the genus Phlebovirus consists of a genetically diverse group of viruses. a few members of this genus were identified as important pathogens in humans and domestic animals. pairwise identity and phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the partial NP and G1 genes. also sequences were detected with the closest similarity to sequences of the large segment of phleboviruses, but with a lower coverage of reads. red fox fecal amdovirus Parvoviruses are small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses. the genus Amdoparvovirus currently has two members, Aleutian mink disease virus and Gray fox amdovirus. phylogenetic analysis and calculation of pairwise identities revealed that this virus is most closely related to Grey fox amdovirus, with pairwise identities of respectively 83% on the amino acid level and 80% on the nucleotide level. kobuviruses are small single stranded positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. sequences with the closest similarity to kobuviruses were detected in a common genet. kobuvirus sequences detected in the common genet had the closest similarity to kobuviruses detected in mice and sewage. kobuvirus sequences detected in the foxes were nearly identical to kobuviruses detected in healthy and diarrheic dogs. novel picobirnaviruses Picobirnaviruses are small, non-enveloped, bisegmented double-stranded RNA viruses. sequences that had closest similarity to viruses belonging to the family Picobirnaviridae were detected in fecal samples collected from two common genets, two european minks and two red foxes. obtained sequences of the RdRp gene were most closely related to picobirnaviruses detected previously in rodents and otarines. phylogenetic analysis of Genet fecal picobirnavirus and Red fox fecal picobirnavirus S40-1 and S40-2 using segment 2 of Otarine picobirnavirus. a number of species evaluated in the present study have been the focus of previous viral metagenomics studies in the Netherlands. however, high numbers of previously unknown viruses were detected. this might be due to the relatively low number of animals sampled in each study. a systematic population study of the Endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) and the control and eradication program of the invasive alien American mink in Spain. no animals were sacrificed for the purposes of this study. samples were stored at 20\u00b0C and stored at 70\u00b0C within 2 months. samples were depleted from host nucleic acids and filtered through 0.45 M filter. PCR products were purified and processed for next-generation sequencing with a 454 GS Junior Instrument. phylogenetic analysis of the novel theilovirus, kobuvirus, amdovirus and picobirnaviruses was performed using a neighbor-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates. phylogenetic analysis of GP and NP genes of the novel phleboviruses was performed using a maximum-likelihood tree with 100 bootstrap replicates. n = 1), European mink (n = 9), European pine marten (n = 2); European polecat (n = 3), red fox (n = 4), stone marten (n = 1), and European wild cat (n = 1) were analysed. samples from live trapped individuals were obtained in the framework of a systematic population study of the Endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) sequence independent RNA and DNA virus screening of collected samples. samples were depleted from host nucleic acids and filtered through 0.45 M filter. PCR products were purified and processed for next-generation sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of the novel theilovirus, kobuvirus, amdovirus and picobirnaviruses was performed using a neighbor-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates. phylogenetic analysis of GP and NP genes of the novel phleboviruses was performed using a maximum-likelihood tree with 100 bootstrap replicates. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. deduced amino acid sequence identities between the partial NP gene of Red fox and Otter fecal phlebovirus and selected other viruses belonging to the genus Phlebovirus. the research leading to these results has received funding from the european community\u2019s seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 - 2013) the research has been partially funded by the Basque Government through the Research group on 'Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics'"}
