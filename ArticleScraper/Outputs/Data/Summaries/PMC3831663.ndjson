{"summary": "recombinant DNA techniques allow for identification, modification, production, isolation, and purification of proteins from a range of host systems. production of recombinant proteins routinely encounters problems, including the formation of inclusion bodies, incorrect protein conformation, toxicity to the host cell, or low protein yield. there are several published reviews on both affinity and fusion tags from the past several years. protein complex immunoprecipitation is a technique in which an antibody is bound to a known target protein. a solution is to clone the DNA of the target protein into an expression vector containing a fusion tag at either terminus of the protein. a solution is to clone the DNA of the target protein into an expression vector containing a fusion tag. fusion construct is eluted by the addition of 10 mM reduced glutathione. a protease cleavage site is encoded between GST and the target protein. a protease cleavage site is encoded between GST and the target protein. polyhistidine tags (usually hexahistidine or His6) are also popular for pull-down assays. a his6 tag may be attached to the target protein at either the N- or C-terminus. a number of additional tags are used for pull-down assays. multidomain fusion proteins joined by a flexible linker may be less likely to form well-ordered, diffracting crystals. strategies that require tag removal introduce challenges including optimization of cleavage conditions, added costs of proteases for tag removal and failure to recover soluble or structurally intact protein after tag removal. thombin, enterokinase and FactorXa have historically shown spurious cleavage at sites distinct from the engineered site. however, the lower turnover requires that large quantities of protease are required for tag removal. removing the fusion tag presents a number of advantages in so-called \u201ccarrier-driven\u201d crystallization. high resolution structures of MBP,63\u201365 GST,66 TRX,67,68 and SUMO69,70 have been determined. the tags provide surfaces favorable to crystal lattice formation. the success of carrier-driven GST appears to be limited to protein fragments less than 100 amino acids. MBP confers increased solubility to its fusion partner71 and its crystal structure has been solved. MBP has shown the highest degree of success as a carrier protein for protein structure determination with over 25 structures determined as MBP fusions. a variety of linkers and N-terminal truncations of the target protein should be tried. linkers too long will result in excessive flexibility, whereas linkers too short may influence the target protein structure. functionally active proteins require expression in a eukaryotic host to produce proper folding or desired eukaryotic post-translational modifications. the need to generate functionally active proteins is a necessity of many studies, but is especially important when the protein in question is a potential therapeutic. protease ensures cleavage occurs precisely at the N-terminus of the target protein. protease ensures that cleavage occurs precisely at the N-terminus of the target protein. antimicrobial peptides are studied for their roles in physiology and potential as therapeutics. GST performs inconsistently, as in a number of cases the tag failed to protect against proteolytic cleavage of the precursor peptide. MBP has been used for the production of Human -defensin 25 (hBD25) and Human -defensin 28 (hBD28) but both required refolding steps to recover fusion protein from aggregates in purification. the technology revolves around the use of a yeast-derived protein splicing element coupled to a bacterial chitin-binding affinity purification tag. the intein spontaneously undergoes an S-N acyl shift at its N-terminal cysteine residue to form a thioester bond with the protein of interest. this thioester is then readily cleaved by a number of small molecules such as 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mer the thioester is used to introduce non-natural amino acids into a protein when one of the two partners is produced synthetically rather than biosynthetically. the thioester is used to introduce small molecules such as fluorophores at the C-terminus of the protein of interest to generate enzyme substrates. cleavage reaction is very slow on column cleavage. cleavage is usually carried out for 16 h at room temperature110 or up to 5 days at 4\u00b0C. cleavage reaction is very slow. a number of groups have moved away from inteins to use proteases themselves. these include a his6-tagged cysteine protease domain from Vibrio cholerae138 and a His6-tagged catalytic sortase domain from Staphylococcus aureus. however, these methodologies have not gained wide acceptance outside of the originators' laboratories. Fc-fusion proteins are the best-known example of a fusion tag being used in large scale manufacturing. first created in 1989 as a potential AIDS therapeutic, several commercially available drugs are based on Fc-fusions. at 250 amino acids, the Fc domain can be attached to either terminus of the protein of interest. the addition of an Fc domain to a therapeutic compound provides the fusion with several beneficial pharmacological properties. this is accomplished by the Fc domain binding with the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), which plays a role in protein recycling by preventing lysosomal degradation. expression of CVN with a His6-SUMO tag lead to a soluble protein level in E. coli of over 30% of the total soluble protein. SUMO was used in the production of subunit antigens to anthrax and swine flu."}
