{"summary": "viruses do not contain a conserved genomic region that can be used to identify the viruses in a microbial community. instead, the entire viral community must be sampled and viral genomic sequences compared with known viral reference sequences. the success of this process is limited by the fact that many viruses have not yet been characterized and are not included in viral reference databases. the aBI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was the state-of-the-art platform for high-throughput sequencing, simultaneously generating sequences from 96 clones on a single run. the lengths of sequences generated on this platform are typically 500 to 800 bases. the cost per read limits the number of sequences that can be generated in an experiment. the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) generates up to 640 million sequences per run. the Illumina HiSeq 2000 can generate up to 6 billion paired-end sequences per run. sequences can be generated from both ends of a DNA fragment to yield \u201cpaired-end\u201d reads. BLAST and BLASTX28 work well for relatively small data sets. many short-read sequence alignment tools are fast but have low tolerance for sequence mismatches. allowing mismatches in the alignments is critical. more than 1.7 million sequences were generated using the Roche 454 platform. 65% of the sequences were unclassified, pointing to the existence of vast genomic diversity in the oceanic ecosystem, including many novel viruses. early sequence-based analyses of the virome in samples from humans focused on bacteriophage populations. bacteriophages contribute genes that affect the structure and functions of microbial communities. bacteriophages encode antibiotic resistance genes40 and other genes associated with bacterial metabolic pathways. the perturbation of a microbial environment by a disease, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), can cause changes in the microbiome. similar microbial communities may be established in response to distinct health conditions, such as CF and asthma. these data suggest that in addition to the components of the virome, the dynamics of the viral community may be important for distinguishing the effects of the virome in different microenvironments. viral metagenomic studies of the human gastrointestinal tract evaluated stool from patients with diarrhea46 and non-polio acute flaccid paralysis. the samples evaluated contained a variety of DNA and RNA viruses, including human enteroviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, and parvoviruses. many novel eukaryotic viruses have been discovered or characterized using sequencing. many more viruses undoubtedly remain to be discovered, and further characterization of viral strains and subtypes is an important goal. sequence-based analysis of viral communities has had sensitivity comparable to virus-specific polymerase chain reaction. alternative approaches would be to enrich for viral nucleic acids by carrying out hybridization or alternatively to remove human nucleic acid before sequencing."}
