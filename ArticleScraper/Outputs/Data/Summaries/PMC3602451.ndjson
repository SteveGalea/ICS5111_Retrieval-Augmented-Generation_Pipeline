{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are both severe enteric diseases in newborn piglets. etiologic agents responsible for these diseases are coronaviruses, TGEV and PEDV. TGEV was isolated for the first time in 1946. disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, and has a mortality rate of up to 90%. since 1978, the disease has frequently broken out in many swine-raising countries. in 1996, PED outbreaks have been reported to be responsible for the death of more than 39,000 piglets in Japan. SS6 (-764 LQDGQVKI 771-) are two core epitope domains on S1D5 and S1D6 respectively, located on the S protein of PEDV. a novel antigenic domain -1368GPRLQPY1347- motif has excellent immunogenicity has been identified on the C-terminal portion of the S protein. the plasmid Easy-T-S containing the full-length S gene of TGEV strain Purdue was constructed in our laboratory by common cloning techniques. a sense primer P1 (5' GGGGCTAGCCCATGAAAAAACTATTTG 3') and an antisense primer P2 (5' CCCCGAATTCTTTGTCTAATAA 3') which contain NheI (P1) and EcoRI (P2) restriction enzyme sites were used for PCR. recombinant plasmid pIRES-TGEV-S1 was digested with NheI and EcoRI. PEDV-S1 and PEDV-S were digested with SalI and NotI. the resulting recombinant plasmids were designated as pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1). plasmids pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1), pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) and pIRES were chromatographically purified from bacterial lysates. all plasmids were dissolved in 0.1 M PBS to a final concentration of 1 g/l. cells transfected with empty vector were used as control. cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes. cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. the mice were boosted twice, each at 2-week intervals as shown in Table 1.

our laboratory by common cloning techniques. pIRES-TGEV-S1 and PEDV-S were digested with NheI and EcoRI. the resulting plasmids were designated as pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) after transformation, clones were picked and validated by DNA sequencing. plasmids pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1), pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) and pIRES were chromatographically purified from bacterial lysates. all plasmids were dissolved in 0.1 M PBS to a final concentration of 1 g/l. the proteins were electronically transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane. the membrane was blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C using 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) followed by incubation with the anti-TGEV or anti-PEDV serum (1300 dilution in PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. group number of mice Vaccine
