{"summary": "anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease that spreads through contact with spores of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis through skin contact (generally with infected animal products), inhalation, or ingestion. spores have been developed as a biological weapon by several countries [4,5,6], mostly in africa and central and south Asia. the TiO2 photocatalyst is effective only on irradiation with UV light at the necessary levels, which can induce severe damage to human eyes and skin [12,13,14,15]. this greatly restricts the potential applications of the photocatalyst for use in human living environments. the effect of carbonaceous species on physical properties was observed on UV-visible absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. the results collectively suggested that the C200 NPs exhibit a photocatalytic property under visible light illumination. however, whether C200 NPs can eliminate spore-forming bacteria has remained uncertain. Scanning electron microscopy (A,B), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis for the 1s atomic orbital of carbon (C) and UV-Vis absorption spectra (D) of UV100 TiO2 and C200 NPs used in this study. UV100 TiO2 and C200 NPs exhibited higher visible-light-responsive antibacterial properties to kill B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis vegetative bacteria. n = 6, three experiments with two replicates. all vegetative bacteria (A) or spores (B) in the UV100 TiO2 groups were normalized to 100%. illumination intensity was 3 104 lux (90 mW/cm2), and reaction time was 30 min. treatment of LT can lead to the death of macrophage cells in vitro. LT was treated with or without UV100 TiO2 and C200 photocatalysis. surviving cells of untreated groups were adjusted to 100%. n = 6, three experiments with two replicates. the levels of surviving bacteria of macrophage-engulfed B. subtilis were markedly suppressed 8 h after ingestion. these results suggest that the C200-mediated photocatalysis also induced damage in bacterial cells that could be repaired after plating. this suggests that the bacteria that survive the photocatalysis are still more easily secured and eliminated by phagocytes in the immune system. sorption analyses of the newly prepared C200 NPs were performed (Figure 1). we found that both TiO2 and C200 displayed nanoscale structures (Figure 1A,B), and that an increased content of carbon (Figure 1C) and C200 displayed considerable redshift absorbance compared with TiO2 NPs (Figure 1D) the results indicated that C200 substrates can inactivate B. subtilis in half an hour when exposed to various degrees of illumination by visible light. the bacteria-killing efficiency in the C200 groups was significantly higher than in the respective UV100 TiO2 groups. B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis vegetative bacteria were photocatalyzed using UV100 TiO2 and C200 NPs. the illumination intensity was 3 104 lux (90 mW/cm2), and the reaction time was 30 min. anthrax LT can be detected in culture media and spores of B. anthracis. treatment of LT can lead to the death of macrophage cells in vitro [30] and lead to mortality in rodents. B. subtilis was used as a surrogate for B. anthracis to treat macrophage cells. we applied a subbacterial killing condition (3 104 for 5 min) under which bacterial survival could not be significantly suppressed. levels of surviving bacteria were markedly suppressed 8 h after ingestion. anthrax spores were pretreated with photocatalysis by using UV100 TiO2 and C200 NPs. n = 6, three experiments with two replicates. Discussion Disinfection is a vital method for controlling numerous pathogens in sterilization of critical instruments, water treatment, food production, and hospital environments. visible-light-activated photocatalytic NPs may be used as a disinfectant in human living environments such as indoor spaces and public areas. a pioneering work demonstrated that supplements with various types of NPs, including TiO2 NPs, may reduce the growth of Escherichia coli and B. anthracis in humans. carbon-containing titanium dioxide C200 NPs exhibit superior photocatalytic properties under visible-light illumination compared with UV100 TiO2 NPs [17,19,24,26,27,28]. however, whether C200 NPs can eliminate spore-forming bacteria has remained elusive. mol was slowly introduced into 90 mL of anhydrate ethanol and 20 mL of deionized water in a 250 mL flask. the mixed solution was uniformly agitated at 500 rpm for 3 h, producing a precipitate of titanium hydroxide. the dried powder was calcined in air at 200 \u00b0C for 5 h. B. anthracis (ATCC 14186) containing both pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids to express functional LT and edema toxin (ET) was grown on blood agar plates and maintained in brain\u2013heart infusion broth (BHIB) using previously described methods. agar plates were incubated at 25\u201337 \u00b0C until 90%\u201399% phase-bright spores were observed using phase-contrast light microscopy. the quality of spores was determined by two complementary criteria previously established for validating the presence of dormant spores. the bacterial cultures (2.5 104 CFU) were mixed with the TiO2 or C200 NPs (200 g/mL in 150 L of normal saline) the cultures were placed onto a 24-well cell culture dish. photocatalytic reactions were carried out using an incandescent lamp. anthrax LT is composed of two protein components, a PA (cell receptor-binding) and an LF (metalloprotease) the culture supernatants were filter-sterilized by being passed through a 0.22-mm filter. phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1 mM was added to prevent toxin degradation. the LT solution was mixed with the TiO2 or C200 nanoparticles (200 g/mL in 150 L of normal saline) by using a 200 L pipetman and placed onto a 24-well cell culture dish. the bacterial solution was then added into one well of a six-well cell culture dish containing confluent mur. ine macrophage J774A.1 cells (1 106 cells/well; MOI: 0.1 bacteria/cell) after phagocytosis was carried out for 1 h, the culture medium was removed, and 200 L of a cell lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100) modified from that described in previous acid was added to catalyze the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. the mixed solution was uniformly agitated at 500 rpm for 3 h, producing a precipitate of titanium hydroxide. the surface of C200 was found to contain unique anatase/rutile mixed crystalline phases. B. anthracis (ATCC 14186) containing both pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids to express functional LT and edema toxin (ET) was grown on blood agar plates and maintained in brain\u2013heart infusion broth (BHIB) at 30 \u00b0C. the agar plates were incubated at 25\u201337 \u00b0C until 90%\u201399% phase-bright spores were observed using phase-contrast light microscopy. the quality of spores was determined by two complementary criteria previously established for validating the presence of dormant spores. the bacterial cultures (2.5 104 CFU) were mixed with the TiO2 or C200 NPs (200 g/mL in 150 L of normal saline) using a 200 L pipetman. photocatalytic reactions were carried out using an incandescent lamp. a light meter was used to record the illumination density. culture supernatants were filter-sterilized by being passed through a 0.22-mm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) the culture supernatants were concentrated using the Minitan Ultrafiltration System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1 mM was added to prevent toxin degradation. bacterial cultures (2.5 104 CFU) were mixed with TiO2 or C200 NPs. the bacteria-containing solutions were then recovered from the 24-well plates. after illumination, the bacteria-containing solutions (85 L) were recovered. a cell lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100) modified from that described in previous literature was then added to release the cell-engulfed or cell-bound bacteria."}
