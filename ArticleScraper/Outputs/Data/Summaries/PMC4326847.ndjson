{"summary": "there are 10 protein-coding human PSG genes, PSG1\u2013PSG9 and PSG11 (PSG10 is a noncoding pseudogene) arrayed within a genomic region of 0.55 Mb in chromosome 19 (Ensembl) (1). the human PSG structure consists of an Ig variable region-like N-terminal domain, followed by two or three Ig constant region type 2-like domains termed A1 and B2. tetraspanin CD9 binds murine PSG17, but not PSG23; however, both PSG17 and PSG23 were found to bind to cellular proteoglycans via the N-terminal domain (8, 9). human PSG1 also binds cell-surface proteoglycans (10) and the platelet integrin IIb3 (3). in vivo studies showed that PSG1-Fc treatment reduced inflammation in a TGF-1-dependent manner in a model of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis (15). to study the activation of SLC, we expressed PSG1 domains independently fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (PSG1-N-Fc, PSG1-A2-Fc and PSG1-B2-Fc) cDNA consisting of the PSG1 leader peptide followed by the indicated domain was synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. and subcloned into the EcoRI-BglII sites of the pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 vector. the four mutant N-terminal domain proteins were obtained by replacing the wild-type sequence in the cDNA encoding the leader peptide and the N-terminal domain of PSG1 cloned into the pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 vector. the PCR product was cloned into the pET-41 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen, Billerica, MA) the proper insert orientation and sequence were confirmed by sequencing with the a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa was present in the insoluble fraction. a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa was present in the insoluble fraction. the protein was recovered by centrifugation followed by several washes with BugBuster. for quantitation purposes, the purified proteins were separated on 4\u201320% nuPAGE Bis-Tris gels at different dilutions alongside known concentrations of BSA (Thermo Scientific) the proteins were quantitated by densitometry. antibodies to the specific domains, including monoclonal antibody 4 (which reacts with the N-terminal domain), monoclonal antibody BAP1 (Aldevron Freiburg GmbH, Freiburg, Germany; which reacts the chip surfaces were regenerated by a 60-s injection of 10 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.0) Kinetic data were analyzed using BIAevaluation version 4.1.1. all binding curves were corrected for background and bulk refractive index contribution by subtraction of the reference flow cells. 1.6 104 MLECs were seeded onto a 96-well plate in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite medium (Sigma-Aldrich) after 3 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer. after 16 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer. luciferase was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with PSG1-GST-B2. the increase in luciferase was compared with control-treated samples. supernatants were collected after 16\u201322 h. osyltransferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene was normalized to those of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. the experiment was repeated three independent times using three wells per treatment. cDNA consisting of the PSG1 leader peptide followed by the indicated domain was synthesized by GenScript USA Inc.

RAW264.7 cells were cultured in 5% CO2 and 95% air in 37 \u00b0C humidified incubators. pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 vector has a His6 tag at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein. it was purified from the supernatant of stably transfected CHO-K1 cells. monoclonal antibody 4 was previously used to purify PSG1 from the serum of pregnant women. the PCR product was cloned into pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 as the template. the proper insert orientation and sequence were confirmed. the proper insert orientation and sequence were confirmed by sequencing with the S-tag primer as recommended by the manufacturer. the insoluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation, followed by several washes with BugBuster as suggested by the manufacturer. the protein was solubilized in binding buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole) anti-B2 peptide polyclonal antibody was used to confirm the identity of the single-domain mutants by Western blotting. the SPR protein-protein interactions were analyzed by the SPR technique using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) a control cell was prepared in the same way but without protein. a control cell was prepared in the same way but without protein. a reference cell was prepared in the same way but without protein. each interaction was analyzed at least three times. ELISAs Active TGF-1 was detected as described previously (15). luciferase reporter mink lung epithelial cell was seeded onto a 96-well plate in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite medium. after 3 h, the MLECs were either treated either with DMEM and 0.1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite medium (Sigma-Aldrich) macrophages were plated at a density of 1.8 105 cells/well of a 96-well plate in triplicate in DMEM and 5% HyClone FetalClone III. supernatant (0.1 ml) was activated with 1 n HCl, followed by neutralization to measure total TGF-1 by ELISA.

The B2 domain of PSG1 interacts with SLC and LAP of TGF-1. the B2 domain is the only domain of PSG1 that does not have potential N-linked glycosylation sites (27). a bacterial expression system allowed us to generate sufficient quantities of the B2 domain (PSG1-GST-B2) to further test the function of this domain in activation assays. increasing concentrations of PSG1-N-Fc, PSG1-A2-Fc, and CEACAM9-Fc were incubated with 50 ng/ml SLC for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the percentage of SLC activated was measured with a TGF- receptor II-Fc capture ELISA. MLECs treated with PSG1 domains in the absence of SLC did not show enhanced luciferase activity compared with control proteins. MLECs responded to the presence of active TGF- following incubation of SLC with PSG1-A2-Fc and PSG1-N-Fc. the LSKL peptide competes with TSP-1 and inhibits the ability of this protein to trigger activation of latent TGF-1. a scrambled peptide control at 10-fold molar excess did not reduce binding of PSG1 to LAP compared with binding in the absence of peptides. the PSG1 N-terminal Domain Induces TGF-1 in RAW264.7 Macrophages TGF-1 is a ubiquitous cytokine produced by many cells types. the identification of factors that induce its production has been limited. the earliest time point post-treatment at which we detected a significant difference in total TGF-1 was 8 h (1.5 0.17-fold increase) the difference in total TGF-1 between treatments was greater when the conditioned medium was collected 18\u201324 h post-treatment. the difference in total TGF-1 between treatments was greater when the conditioned medium was collected 18\u201324 h. the amino acids mutated in the CC\u2032 loop failed to induce TGF-1. the protein with the amino acids mutated in the CC\u2032 loop failed to induce TGF-1 even when the macrophages were treated with 12 g/ml protein. this result indicates that the CC\u2032 loop is critical for PSG1 induction of TGF-1 from macrophages. amino acids in the CC\u2032 loop region of the N-terminal domain of PSG1 are essential for induction of TGF-1 from RAW264.7 macrophages. recombinant proteins used for these studies were separated on a 4\u201320% NuPAGE gel and stained with GelCode Blue.

ELISA consistently observed that higher levels of TGF-1 co-purified with the PSG1-B2-Fc protein expressed in CHO-K1 cells compared with the concentration of TGF-1 associated with PSG1-N-Fc and PSG1-A2-Fc generated under the same conditions. the concentration of human LAP measured by ELISA when the proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells was always highest in the PSG1-B2-Fc preparations amino acids other than the LSKL sequence in LAP are involved in the interaction between the B2 domain of PSG1 and LAP. the matrix glycoprotein tenascin X (TNX) activates SLC of TGF- in a cell adhesion-dependent manner. CC\u2032 loop are essential for the ability of the N-terminal domain of PSG1 to induce the secretion of TGF-1. amino acids LHYH in the CC\u2032 loop resulted in a protein that did not induce secretion of TGF-1."}
