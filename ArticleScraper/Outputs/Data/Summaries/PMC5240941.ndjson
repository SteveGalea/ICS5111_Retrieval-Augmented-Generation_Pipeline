{"summary": "viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) studies from all parts of the world have shown that HMPV causes respiratory tract infection (RTI) in children. two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9\u201312]. risk factors for severe RSV infection are young age, prematurity, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and severe neurological disabilities. most studies have separately dealt with risk factors for severe HMPV and RSV infections. prospectively enrolled a large cohort of 16 years old who were admitted to hospital with acute RTI during a nearly 9-year long period from 2006 to 2015. some children were included more than one time if they were hospitalized with distinct RTI episodes. recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. LRTI was categorized into five categories based on clinical manifestations. children with one or more characteristic manifestations of rhino-pharyngitis, tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media or acute laryngitis were diagnosed with URTI. asthmatic children who developed symptoms and signs of pneumonia were categorized with pneumonia. respiratory support with a non-invasive ventilator (NIV) included positive airway pressure via mask in continuous or bi-level modes, or via a high-flow nasal cannula. admission to the PICU was reported as a disease severity measure. a high viral load was defined as a Ct-value 28, a medium viral load with Ct-values of 28\u201335. Ct-values above 42 were regarded as virus-negative. the HMPV-positive specimens were genotyped by real-time PCR and DNA sequencing using primers targeting the F-gene of HMPV [11]. a 527-bp amplicon was sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) final models for HMPV and RSV were obtained by stepwise removing factors with P > 0.1. results from the final models were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values. some children were included more than one time if they were hospitalized with distinct RTI episodes. recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. children were enrolled from the beginning of November 2006 to the end of July 2015. children with one or more characteristic manifestations of rhino-pharyngitis, tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media or acute laryngitis were diagnosed with URTI. asthmatic children who developed symptoms and signs of pneumonia were categorized with pneumonia. RS with a non-invasive ventilator (NIV) included positive airway pressure via mask in continuous or bi-level modes, or via a high-flow nasal cannula. a high viral load was defined as a Ct-value 28, a medium viral load with Ct-values of 28\u201335, and a low viral load with Ct-values >35. the detection of HMPV as a single virus in the NPA is named single HMPV, while HMPV co-detected with 1 other virus is named HMPV. a 527-bp amplicon was sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit. genomes were determined by comparing sequenced data with the nucleotide BLAST database. some of the NPA were not type-able due to a low viral load. final models were obtained by stepwise removing factors with P > 0.1. results from the final models were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values, and used for inference. asthma was the most common chronic disease at 20%, while 13% had other chronic airway diseases. median peak CRP level was slightly elevated at 35 mg/L, whereas one-third had otitis media. bronchiolitis was slightly more frequent than pneumonia, appearing in 61.

HMPV infections among hospitalized children with LRTI were manifested independently of viral co-detection and HMPV genotypes. a history of prematurity and chronic disease increased the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV-infected children. *CRP, C-reactive protein, sampled from all HMPV A and 79 HMPV B.
