{"summary": "bats are reservoirs for many RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans yet attenuated in their natural host. these include filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) (1\u20134), coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) (5, 6), alphaviruses (Venezuelan equine encepha all three OASs (OAS1 to -3) produce 2-5A upon binding dsRNA. the catalytic domain of OASs undergoes a conformational rearrangement to form the catalytic cavity. 2-5A binds to monomeric RNase L, leading to dimerization and activation to cleave viral and cellular single-stranded RNAs. genome contains three Oas genes with interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region, two Oasl genes, and one RNase L gene. genome contains three Oas genes with interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs), two Oasl genes, and one RNase L gene. the annotated ER OAS3-like gene encodes a protein of 1,903 amino acids. amino acids 1 to 1082 share 80% similarity with human OAS3. amino acids 1197 to 1903 share 71% similarity with human OAS2. mOASL1 mOASL2 bOAS1 Yes ND 71/62 ND ND bOAS3 Yes ND 80/71 ND bOASL1 Yes 37/33 ND 56/54 69 a Protein catalytic activity was predicted by the conservation in the active site of the P-loop and aspartic acid triad. the gene sequences were derived from GenBank: bOas1 (ID 107513273), bOas3-like (ID 107513228) for both Oas2 and Oas3 ISREs, hOAS1 (ID 4938), hOAS2 (ID 4939), and hOAS3 (ID 4940). er Oas1 gene promoter region contains one ISRE with high sequence identity with that of human OAS1. mRNA was used as a positive control (14) and was increased by 81-fold upon IFN- treatment. all three bOAS mRNAs were induced by IFN-; the bOAS1 mRNA level increased by 48-fold, while the mRNA level of bOAS2 and bOAS3 increased by 22- and 11-fold. the mRNA level of bOAS2 and bOAS3 increased by 22- and 11- the mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR, calculated relative to -actin mRNA, and expressed as fold over levels of mock treatment using the formula 2(CT). the data are pooled from three independent experiments. bOAS1, bOAS2.2, and bOAS3.3 have the potential to recognize dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. ER full-length OAS1 (XP_016005252) and the C-terminal catalytic domain of OAS2 and OAS3 (translated from mRNA sequencing of cDNA clones) were aligned with the corresponding portions of human OAS1 p46 (NP_058132.2), OAS SL2 is similar to mOASL2 (69%) and when aligned with human OAS1 has a conserved catalytic domain. er OASL1 (XP_015982708) is aligned with mouse OASL1 (Q8VI94) and human OASL (Q15646) Copyright 2019 Li et al is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. the amino acids responsible for 2-5A binding (stars) and catalysis residues (diamonds) are conserved among bat and human RNase L sequences. ER RNase L was aligned with human RNase L (Q05823.2) expression of bOAS2 protein was detected in all of these bat cells. no OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein was detected in these cells. expression of bOAS2 is induced by IFN- treatment in cells. the data in each panel are from one representative of two independent experiments. bRNase L-KO and bRNase L-KO cells showed approximately 100- to 200-fold higher titers than human cells. bOAS1-KO and bOAS2-KO clones were more modestly elevated. bOAS1-KO and bOAS2-KO clones were more modestly elevated. bOAS2-KO and bOAS3-KO clones were infected with SINV. from the Oas1 gene of bOAS1-KO cells and the RNase L gene of bRNase L-KO cells were amplified, sequenced, and compared with reference sequences of the genes. the positions of 18S and 28S rRNA are indicated. i/7 clones were infected with SINV (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) at the indicated time points, the supernatants were harvested; and infectious viruses were titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells. the data are pooled from two independent experiments with three biological replicates in each experiment. hOAS3 expressed in bOAS3-KO cells restores antiviral effects of RNase L activation. bOAS3-KO cells expressing 3FLAG-hOAS3 were infected with SINV (MOI = 10 PFU/cell); at 12 h postinfection, cells were lysed; and RNA integrity was assessed on a bioanalyzer. we investigated the role of MAVS in OAS-RNase L activation. we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate bMAVS-KO cells. the KO was validated by sequencing (Fig. 8A) in the RoNi/7 Mavs gene. new tab MAVS-independent activation of OAS-RNase L pathways limit SINV replication in both human and bat cells. DNA sequences encompassing the mutations from the Mavs gene of bMAVS-KO cells were amplified and sequenced and compared with reference sequences of the gene. the viral titer data are pooled from two independent experiments with three biological replicates in each experiment. at the indicated time points, the supernatants were harvested; infectious viruses were titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells. the data are pooled from two independent experiments with three biological replicates in each experiment. we infected bRNase L-KO, bOAS1-KO, bOAS2-KO, bOAS3-KO, and bMAVS-KO cells with VACVE3L. rRNA was harvested from cells at 6 h postinfection for rRNA analysis. cells were lysed at 42 h postinfection for determination of viral replication by plaque assays. the genome contains three Oas genes with interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region, two Oasl genes, and one RNase L gene. the genes were annotated as OAS1 (GenBank ID 107513273), OASL (GenBank ID 107513228), and OASL (GenBank ID 107513228) no OAS2 was noted. we cloned the bOAS1 open reading frame (ORF) successfully, but could not clone the mRNA predicted to encode a bOAS3-bOAS2 fusion protein. instead, we cloned two cDNAs which encode bOAS2 and bOAS3 open reading frames separately. hOAS2 (NP_058197.2), hOAS3 (NP_006178.2), and hOASL1 (Q15646); mouse proteins, mOAS1a (P11928), mOAS2 (E9Q9A9), mOAS3 (Q8VI93), mOASL1 (Q8VI94), and mOASL2 (Q9Z2F2). the ISRE of ER bOAS3 is identical to the first one found in the human OAS3 gene. we did not find an ISRE in the promoter region of the ER RNase L gene. bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3 mRNAs are induced by IFN- or infection with SINV or SeV. bOAS2 mRNA was only weakly (4- to 6-fold) induced and bOAS3 mRNA was induced slightly more (15- or 9-fold) during SINV or SeV infection. mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR, calculated relative to -actin mRNA. bOAS1, bOAS2.2, and bOAS3.3 have the potential to recognize dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. bOAS1, bOAS2.2, and bOAS3.3 have the potential to recognize dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. bOASL2 is similar to mOASL2 (69%) and when aligned with human OAS1 has a conserved catalytic domain. ER OASL1 (XP_015982708) is aligned with mouse OASL1 (Q8VI94) and human OASL (Q15646). Egyptian Rousette (ER) shares high amino acid similarity to human RNase L with conserved 2-5A binding sites and endoribonuclease catalytic sites. by sequence alignment, we found that bRNase L shares 77% amino acid similarity with the human protein. antisera against either bOAS2 or bOAS3 detected both OAS proteins. basal expression of OAS3 was detected in RoNi/7 cells and Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts. expression was upregulated upon IFN- treatment in both cell types. us fuscus skin fibroblasts were treated with 1,000 U universal human IFN- for 24 h and lysed. proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to bOAS2 or bOAS3. degradation of rRNA was detected in wild-type (WT) and bOAS1-KO and bOAS2-KO cells but not in bOAS3-KO and bRNase L-KO cells. at 24 and 36 h postinfection, both bRNase L-KO and bOAS3-KO cells showed approximately 100- to 200-fold higher titers than parental WT cells. bOas1, bOas2, bOas3, and bRNase L-KO RoNi/7 cells were mock treated or treated with 1,000 U of IFN- overnight. cells were lysed, and proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting. the data are from one representative of two independent experiments. WT and two bOAS2-KO or bOAS3-KO clones were infected with SINV. at 12 hours postinfection, cells were lysed; and RNA integrity was assessed. expression of 3FLAG-hOAS3 in bOAS3-KO cells was verified by Western blotting. WT, bOAS3-KO, and 3FLAG-hOAS3-expressing cells were infected with SINV. degradation of rRNA was detected in WT and 3FLAG-hOAS3 cells. rRNA integrity was assessed on a bioanalyzer. the positions of 18S and 28S are indicated. the data are from two independent experiments. KO of MAVS from RoNi/7 cells reduced bOAS2 and bOAS3 induction during SINV infection. rRNA degradation was observed in MAVS-KO A549 cells. no significant titer differences were observed at 24 or 36 h postinfection. the data in each panel are from one representative of two independent experiments. WT and bMAVS-KO human A549 cells were infected with SINV (MOI = 1 PFU/cell); at 24 h postinfection, cells were lysed; and RNA integrity was assessed on a bioanalyzer. the data are pooled from two independent experiments with three biological replicates in each experiment. the clones labeled \u201c#1\u201d are the ones used to generate the data in Fig. 8. activation of RNase L during vaccinia virus infection of RoNi/7 cells was dependent on OAS3 but not OAS1, OAS2 or MAVS. bMAVS and KO RoNi/7 cells were infected with VACVE3L (MOI = 1 PFU/cell), and at 6 h postinfection cells were lysed. we cloned and sequenced the open reading frames (ORFs) from the mRNAs encoding bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3. bOAS1 is predicted to encode bOAS1, a homologue of human OAS1 and a bOAS3-like gene which was predicted to encode a long OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein. bOASL1 and bOASL2 encode homology to mouse and human OAS proteins. bOASL2 shares high sequence similarity with mouse OASL2. hOASL is more similar to mouse OASL1 than to mouse OASL2. bOAS3 has one ISRE, human OAS3 has two ISREs and mRNA induction was about 9- to 15-fold in both bat and human cells with IFN. the number of ISREs by itself does not have a major influence on the fold induction of OAS gene expression. bOAS3 is induced in bOAS3-KO cells as well as in WT cells. this was due to a higher affinity of OAS3 for long dsRNA compared to shorter OAS1 and OAS2 proteins (21, 22), which is likely the case for the bat homologues. degradation of rRNA occurred to a similar extent in the absence of OAS1 and OAS2 as in WT cells. previous studies concluded that human OAS1 has an antiviral function which is RNase L independent. however, degradation of rRNA occurred to a similar extent in the absence of OAS1 and OAS2 as in WT cells. basal OAS levels which are weakly induced in the absence of MAVS are sufficient for activation of RNase L. a recent study showed robust RNase L activation as early as 2 h after pIC transfection in human A549 cells. this is in contrast to RNase L, which dramatically limits viral replication. fugus embryonic fibroblasts, Myotis velifer embryonic fibroblasts, and Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts (47) were obtained from cedric Feschotte (Cornell University) the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. bOAS1, bOAS2 and bOAS3 cDNAs were cloned from RoNi/7 cells. three cDNA fragments were cloned to assemble the full length of the bOAS3 open reading frame. bOAS1, bOAS2, bOAS3-F2, and bOAS3-F3 were amplified by using AccuPrime DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) the DNA fragment of bOAS3-F1 was amplified by using Q5 DNA polymerase (NEB) and was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) the cloned DNAs were sequenced and analyzed. pLenti-sgbO2 (targeting the bOas2 gene), pLenti-sgbRL (targeting the bRNase L gene), and pLenti-sgbMA (targeting the bMavs gene).
