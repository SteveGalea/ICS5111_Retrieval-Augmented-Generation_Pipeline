{"summary": "Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that are frequently associated with enteric or respiratory diseases in humans, livestock and companion animals. a fraction of their proteins are subgroup-specific and the amino-acid sequence of their most conserved proteins may differ by as much as 50%. the FCoV genome (strain FIPV WSU-79/1146) contains 29 125 nucleotides and contains six open reading frames. the first two ORFs encode two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. proteolytic cleavage of these polyproteins by virus-encoded proteinases predicted to give rise to a total of 16 mature nonstructural proteins. tertiary structures, solved using X-ray or/and NMR analyses, have been reported for a substantial number of nsps from at least one coronavirus, typically SARS-CoV. these structures represent a variety of separate domains, entire proteins and even multiprotein complexes. Coronavirus infection induces extensive reorganization of endoplasmic reticulum membranes into a reticulovesicular network. it is currently believed that nsp4 functions in anchoring the viral replication\u2013transcription complex (RTC) to these modified membranes. soluble and well expressing construct containing residues 2731\u20132826 (here called the nsp4ct domain) was chosen for scale-up expression and purification. this construct has 14 additional N-terminal residues, including a noncleavable His6 tag. a pellet from 1 l cell culture was resuspended in 20 ml buffer A (10 mM CHES pH 9.1 and 300 mM NaCl, plus 2 mM -mercaptoethanol in case of seMet-substituted nsp4ct) the cells were sonicated and the protein was purified from the soluble cellular fraction by Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatography. the eluate was buffer-exchanged three data sets were collected: two single-wavelength native data sets (data sets 1 and 2) and a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set (at peak wavelength; data set 3). data set 1 was collected from a single crystal at 100 K on the EMBL beamline X12 at DESY using a MAR 225 CCD detector. a total of 670 images were collected to a maximum resolution of 2.76.

Strand 4 is observed in molecules C and D and strand 6 is observed in molecules A\u2013D. the characteristic feature of the structure is the 21-residue-long helix 4. the structure represents a novel protein fold. -acid data for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FCoV, NC_007025.1), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV, MHV, NP_001012459.1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS_CoV, NP_904322.1) and infectious bronchitis virus strain Beaudette (IBV, NP_740625) the buried surface of each dimer involves approximately 25 residues from 1, 3, 4, loop L3\u20134 and the C-terminus. the interaction interface contains an intramolecular three-stranded antiparallel -\u00adsheet. ecule A is shown in green, molecule C is shown in yellow. molecule C is shown in yellow, O atoms are shown in red and N atoms are shown in blue. the surface area supports the likelihood of dimerization. the sequence identity between FCoV and HCoV-NL63 is 68%. the sequence identity between MHV and SARS-CoV is 53%. IBV, on the other hand, is the most distantly related virus. there are four clusters of highly conserved residues. the first is between residues 9 and 19 and includes residues in helix 1 and strand 3. the second comprises residues 45\u201353 that belong to helix 3. nsps did not identify any possible WW domains, suggesting that the YxPP motif interacting partner is a host protein. localization of the pro\u2013pro motif may protect the extended unstructured C-terminus from proteolytic cleavage by host enzymes. 88.0% of the residues are located in the preferred regions of the Ramachandran diagram. glu57 and Ala58 are located in the N-\u00adterminus of helix 3. nsp4ct has nine conserved and two nonconserved hydrophobic residues. these residues form the hydrophobic core of the structure. the structure represents a novel protein fold. onavirus NL63 (HCoV, ABE97129), murine hepatitis virus (MHV, NP_001012459.1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS_CoV, NP_904322.1) and infectious bronchitis virus strain Beaudette. alignment was produced with ClustalW2 (Larkin et al., 2007) and edited with JalView. the buried surface of each dimer involves approximately 25 residues from 1, 3, 4, loop L3\u20134 and the C-terminus. the interaction interface contains an intramolecular three-stranded antiparallel -\u00adsheet. the results obtained from analytical size-exclusion chromatography of nsp4ct showed that the protein is monomeric in solution under the experimental conditions used. the crystal structure con\u00adtains a monomer as well as two dimers. the buried surface area supports the likelihood of dimerization and this may have physiological significance. the nsp4ct sequence identity between viruses belonging to the same group is higher than that for viruses belonging to different groups. the sequence identity between FCoV and HCoV-NL63 is 68% and that between MHV and SARS-CoV is 53%. the sequence identity between MHV and HCoV-NL63 is 68%. there are four clusters of highly conserved residues. the first is between residues 9 and 19 and includes residues in helix 1 and strand 3. the second comprises residues 45\u201353 that belong to loop L3\u20134. the high conservation of the nsp4ct domain suggests it plays a ubiquitous role in the coronavirus life cycle. however, it suggests that nsp4 proteins from different subgroups are structurally similar and have similar modes of operation. this suggests that it plays a ubiquitous role in the coronavirus life cycle. f."}
