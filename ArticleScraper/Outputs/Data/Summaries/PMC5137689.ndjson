{"summary": "243 -helical AMPs and 243 -helical decoy peptides derived from natural and synthetic sources. a balanced blind test set of 43 AMP and 43 decoy -helical peptides was constructed. the classifier demonstrated excellent performance against the blind test set. a length of 20\u201325 amino acids generate membrane deformation by spanning the lipid bilayer and inducing opposite membrane curvature in orthogonal directions. accordingly, we control within our screen peptide homology to known AMPs. this criterion favors sequences for which the classifier possesses high positive predictive value and specificity at the expense of sensitivity. trial sequences are accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion p a c c c = min 1, exp ( / T), where = t r i a l c u r e n t and T is an effective temperature (40\u201342) all unique candidates were saved for the computational screen. physicochemically restricted sequences are optimal in the sense that no other candidates exist for which any one criterion can be improved without degrading at least one other. this Pareto frontier constrained so that none of the 12 bagged descriptors could lie more than 10% outside the range observed in the training set. orange diamonds pick out the 85 peptides lying on the physicochemically restricted Pareto frontier of physicochemically unrestricted sequences. red stars are the 16 peptides proximate to the frontiers that were selected to synthesize and test with SAXS and killing assays. analysis of literature suggests that the majority of the known AMPs that we tested are compounds with multiplexed activities in addition to membrane penetration. we propose a way to identify candidate sequences with multiplexed functions in next section. the ability of a peptide to generate NGC in model membranes is an excellent proxy for antimicrobial activity through membrane-permeating properties (7, 11, 39) we incubated these test sequences with small unilamellar vesicles mimicking bacterial membranes compositions 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (PS)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3 the amount of induced membrane curvature in these phases can be directly compared. the same procedure was carried out for the other 10 sequences that generated cubic phases in these membranes. they also generated either Pn3m or Im3m phases (Fig. 3 C and D) unlabeled peaks correspond to coexisting lamellar and/or hexagonal phases induced by peptides. unlabeled peaks correspond to coexisting lamellar and/or hexagonal phases induced by peptides. our SVM classifier has learned to discriminate peptides based on their capacity to generate NGC. the distance to hyperplane also provides a measure of the confidence of the algorithm P(+1) in whether or not a sequence is antimicrobial. this result makes sense because P(+1) and are monotonically but nonlinearly related. 4 out of 12 descriptors in our final SVM model enforce amphiphilicity in positively classified peptides. we find that amphiphilicity is highly correlated with the ability to generate NGC (RSpearman = 0.680, P = 0.0038) our classifier has learned to distinguish membrane-permeating from non-membrane-permeating -helical peptides. this result illustrates a simultaneous potentiality and deficiency of our SVM, and of QSAR approaches in general. several neuropeptides (purple stars), calcitonin peptide hormones (black stars), viral fusion proteins (yellow stars), membrane anchor proteins (green stars), membrane-permeating protein fragments (blue stars) and topogenic peptides (pink stars) proximate to the Pareto frontiers. our analysis also identified helical membrane-active sequences from topogenic peptides, which are known membrane curvature-generating proteins. these special signal sequences present at the N-terminal portions of newly translated proteins help target and translocate large proteins across intracellular membranes. an SVM classifier trained only on physicochemical information can effectively recapitulate geometric and topological principles required for membrane permeation. the results, which highlight the difference between the efficacy of an antimicrobial and its recognizability as such, are surprising. a balanced blind test set of 43 AMP and 43 decoy -helical peptides was used to make classifications. the classifier demonstrated excellent performance against the blind test set. the trained SVM enables rapid computational screening of peptides. ifier accuracy is expected to diminish in regions of sequence space far from the AMP sequences upon which it was trained. we control within our screen peptide homology to known AMPs. this criterion favors sequences for which the classifier possesses high positive predictive value and specificity at the expense of sensitivity. trial sequences are accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion p a c c = min 1, exp ( / T ). helical content of all 242,110 candidates was evaluated using the ab initio secondary structure prediction algorithm PSIPRED (43, 44) no restriction on the value of the 12 bagged descriptors could lie more than 10% outside the range observed in the training set (20). together, these two frontiers serve as guides for our exploration of the sequence space, and our subsequent interpretation of discovered sequences. we selected to synthesize and test with SAXS and killing assays. Embedding of the 242,110 peptides generated by our directed sequence space search into the 3D space spanned by (i) predicted helical content, (ii) Jukes\u2013Cantor distance to known AMPs, and (iii) distance to hyperplane. the majority of the known AMPs that we tested are compounds with multiplexed activities in addition to membrane penetration. we propose a way to identify candidate sequences with multiplexed functions in the next section. 14 of the synthesized peptides reorganize membranes into cubic phases rich in NGC. we incubated these test sequences with small unilamellar vesicles. they mimicked bacterial membranes compositions 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine. the NGC values calculated from SAXS data indicate that these peptides generate similar quantities of NGC as natural AMPs. none of them generates NGC-rich cubic phases in the same membranes tested with the 16 test peptides. peaks with cubic symmetry, their respective Miller indices, their respective space groups, and resulting lattice parameter a. to test the hypothesis that the SVM classifier has learned to discriminate peptides based on their capacity to generate NGC. we computed the Spearman rank correlations of the magnitude of NGC calculated from the SAXS data. e provides a measure of the confidence of the algorithm P(+1) in whether or not a sequence is antimicrobial. we find a strong positive and statistically significant correlation between the confidence in the prediction of the SVM P(+1) and the magnitude of NGC (RSpearman = 0.653 [0.231, 0.896], P = 0.006) this result has strong implications for the utility of our SVM classifier. amphiphilicity is highly correlated with the ability to generate NGC (RSpearman = 0.680, P = 0.0038) distance to hyperplane of test peptides does correlate with strength of negative Gaussian curvature. there is no significant correlation between magnitude of NGC generation and distance to hyperplane. the classifier uses -helical AMPs as a bootstrap dataset to learn about membrane curvature generating sequences in general. a number of peptides were found to reside near the Pareto frontiers. a number of sequences were found to reside near the Pareto frontiers. several neuropeptides have been shown to be antimicrobial in vitro (48\u201350) but this is an indication that many members of the family can generate the kind of membrane curvature required for permeabilization. this alludes to possible intracellular targets of these neuropeptides and receptor-independent mechanisms of signal transduction in addition to their regular mode of activity. the sequence content of the Pareto-optimal and peptide sequences from the newly identified taxonomies follow the same sequence trends as existing AMPs. directed search of the sequence space discovers diverse families of membrane curvature-generating peptides. an SVM classifier trained only on physicochemical information can effectively recapitulate geometric and topological principles required for membrane permeation. we use machine learning to predict unknown membrane-active peptides from known ones, but also reflexively to identify peptides with multiple functions. vature was measured. full materials and methods are found in the SI Appendix."}
