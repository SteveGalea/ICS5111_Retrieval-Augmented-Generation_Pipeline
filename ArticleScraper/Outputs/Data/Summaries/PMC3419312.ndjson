{"summary": "the ribosome is an ancient molecular machine that brings mRNAs and tRNAs together to synthesize the proteins encoded by the mRNAs using the amino acids supplied by the tRNAs. the ribosome is composed of multiple RNAs (called ribosomal RNAs, rRNAs) and proteins divided into two separate subunits (SU), termed large (LSU) and small (SSU) ribosome is a molecular machine that brings mRNAs and tRNAs together to synthesize the proteins encoded by the mRNAs using the amino acids supplied by the tRNAs. the ribosome is composed of multiple RNAs (called ribosomal RNAs, rRNAs) and proteins divided into two separate subunits (SU), termed large (LSU) and small (SSU) the mRNA from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction is a process called translocation. codons of mRNAs form stable base pairing interactions with the anticodon loops of tRNAs. a second functional center located in the LSU is called the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) translation initiation at nonAUG codons, and ribosomal bypassing of the first (or even subsequent) AUG codons have been well documented, but these tend to be exceptions to the general rule. data emerging from ribosome profiling experiments suggests that a significant fraction of translation initiation events occur at a small subset of nonAUG codons. structural analyses reveals that it is physically located in the same place as its corresponding sequence in bacterial and archaeal ribosomes.8, 9, 10 Also different is the expansion of the major LSU rRNA in eukaryotes, ranging from 25S rRNA in yeast to 28S rRNA in metazoans. in eukaryotes, correct positioning of the initiator AUG on the ribosome is a much more complex process involving many more steps and transacting factors. recruitment of the initiatorMettRNA to the correct AUG remains the central element in reading frame establishment. the first step of elongation occurs when elongator tRNAs are brought to the ribosome in association with a transacting factor, called EFTu in bacteria/archae, and eEF1A in eukaryotes. the anticodon loop of elongator aatRNA is delivered to the decoding center in the Asite of the SSU. this results in a structural rearrangement of the SSU and aatRNA, which end of the deacylated tRNA moves to the Esite on the LSU, the 3\u2032 end of the dipeptidyltRNA moves to the Psite of the LSU. the anticodon loops of both tRNAs remain bound to the P and Asites of the SSU respectively. this conformation is called the \u2018hybrid state\u2019 because the tRNAs occupy one site on the LSU and another on the SSU. termination codons are specifically recognized by release factors (RF1 and RF2 in bacteria/archae, eF1eRF3 complex in eukaryotes) the lack of an amino donor site by the RFs enables a water molecule to enter the PTC, promoting hydrolysis of the nascent polypeptide chain from the peptidyltRNA, resulting in peptide release. structural analyses reveals that it is physically located in the same place as its corresponding sequence in

mechanisms are all 'programmed' to occur at specific sequences by cisacting elements present on mRNAs and at rates that are two or more orders of magnitude more frequent than nonprogrammed events. we will focus on molecular mechanisms that program elongating ribosomes. a typical 1 PRF signal contains a heptameric slippery site, a short spacer, and a complex tertiary mRNA structure. a typical 1 PRF signal contains a heptameric slippery site, a short spacer, and a complex tertiary mRNA structure. the 'integrated model' model of 1 PRF posited that the shift occurs after delivery of the aatRNA to the Asite, but before peptidyltransfer. a refinement of this model proposed that the downstream stimulatory element plays an active role in 1 PRF by resisting 5\u2032 movement of the mRNA subsequent to aatRNA accommodation. this creates tension along the mRNA that can be relieved by disengaging the tRNAs from the mRNA the \u2018many pathways model\u2019 of 1 PRF unified all three models and revealed the major steps in the translation elongation cycle that affect 1 PRF. this model provides a mathematical framework within which estimates can be calculated regarding the relative contributions of each of the elements to rates of 1 PRF. +1 PRF signals are driven by cisacting elements that cause elongating ribosomes to kinetically partition into the +1 frame. the precise mechanisms are different for different +1 PRF signals. the +1 PRF is also enhanced by the presence of a \u2018hungry codon\u2019 in the Asite (i.e., low abundance of RF). the +1 PRF kinetic trap appears to be the presence of a strong secondary mRNA structure 3\u2032 of the slippery site. however, the element that stimulates OAZ +1 PRF has undergone a significant amount of evolutionary divergence. the yeast Ty retrotransposable elements use +1 PRF to direct synthesis of Gagpol fusion proteins. the frameshift is driven by slippage of the Psite tRNA from CUU to UUA. +1 PRF depended on some special characteristic of the AlatRNAUGC. a downstream stimulatory element is also proposed to constitute the kinetic trap. in eukaryotic viruses, the slippery site has the heptameric motif N NNW WWH (IUPAC notation), where the incoming reading frame is indicated by spaces. the nature of the slippery sequence enables repairing of the nonwobble bases of both the aa and peptidyltRNAs with the 1 frame codons. aminoacyl tRNA (aatRNA) into the slippery site pulls the downstream mRNA into the ribosome by 9. the tension is relieved by decoupling tRNAs from the mRNA, with the mRNA slipping backward by one base. peptidyl and aatRNAs simultaneously slip by one base in the 5\u2032 direction to base pair with the 1 frame codons. this cotranslocation model can occur through two discrete kinetic pathways. one occurs after peptidyltransfer, followed by an incomplete translocation event. the second cotranslocational model proposed incomplete translocation stimulated by the downstream element occurs one elongation cycle earlier. this suggests that rather than explaining 1 PRF through a single molecular mechanism, 1 PRF should be conceived as a problem of kinetic partitioning occurring within the context of the translation elongation cycle. +1 PRF has been observed in Escherichia coli in the translation of prfB to produce RF2.34. the expression of the mammalian equivalent of yeast OAZ1, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has also been shown to involve +1 PRF. a rate constant of 1.9 s1 for slippage of the Psite tRNA from CUU to UUU is the driving force behind this mechanism. +1 PRF is enhanced by the presence of a \u2018hungry codon\u2019 in the Asite (i.e., low abundance of RF2) and destabilization of tRNA\u2013mRNA interactions in the Esite. mutation of the rat OAZ Psite sequence from UCC to CCC inhibited frameshifting in S. cerevisiae. OAZ +1 PRF is also autoregulated: it is stimulated by positively charged polyamines. the +1 frameshifts of Ty2 and Ty4 are thought to use this mechanism of tRNA slippage, as well as the yeast ABP140 frameshift signal. the gypsylike yeast retrotransposon is similar to Ty1,50 its +1 PRF signal is different. the mRNAs of many such viruses contain two or more overlapping ORFs in which the major viral nucleocapsid proteins (e.g., Gag) are encoded by a 5\u2032 ORF. sequences encoding proteins with enzymatic functions (typically Pro and Pol) are located 3\u2032 of, and outofframe with the Gag ORF. a study examining the consequences of altering 1 PRF efficiencies in the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARSCoV) showed that viral PRF efficiencies have been finely tuned to deliver a \u2018golden mean\u2019 of proteins required for optimal virus replication and viability63(Figure 2). biochemical and computational screens have identified small compounds capable of binding the 1 PRF signals of HIV159, 67, 68 and SARSCoV. synthetic oligonucleotidebased compounds have also been shown to alter rates of 1 PRF. first study identified 260 putative 1 PRF signals in the annotated portion of the S. cerevisiae genome. however, it was limited by incomplete annotation of the yeast genome. the predicted ribosomal frameshift database (PRFdB) contains a searchable catalog putative eukaryotic 1 PRF signals. this engendered the hypothesis that 1 PRF is used by cells to control mRNA abundance and stability through the nonsensemediated mRNA decay pathway. telomerase suggests that PRF may play a role in telomere length homeostasis by controlling abundance and relative ratios of telomeraseassociated factors. a 1 PRF event directs an elongating ribosome to a premature termination codon (PTC), activating the NMD pathway, resulting in ribosome release and mRNA degradation. the ability of synthetic oligonucleotides to alter rates of 1 PRF suggests that naturally occurring oligonucleotides may hold the key to regulation of 1 PRF. the potential ability to disrupt or stabilize 1 PRF promoting mRNA tertiary structures would provide them with the capacity to promote increased or decreased rates of 1 PRF. the study of PRF continues to illuminate our understanding of how ribosomes normally maintain reading frame. this kinetic view of 1 PRF will be useful in identifying specific targets for antiviral therapeutics. this may explain why changes in 1 PRF efficiency are detrimental to cell viability. I have had the pleasure of working with Dr. Arturas Meskauskas over the past 15 or so years. he developed a seemingly simple, yet powerful assay that continues to today."}
