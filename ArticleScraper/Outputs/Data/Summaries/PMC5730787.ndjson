{"summary": "innate immune response within a mammalian cell is first line of defense against an invading pathogen. viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to prevent and antagonize innate detection by host cells. nsp3 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus prevents IRF3 phosphorylation and NF-B signaling. nsp14 and nsp16 encode 2\u2032-5\u2032 phosphodiesterases that degrade 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates. oligoadenylates are key signaling molecules generated by oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) in response to innate detection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activate RNase L (11) coV nsp15 endonuclease activity ( a mutation in the nsp14 ExoN zinc finger was shown to generate lower levels of dsRNA than wild-type (WT) TGEV. this study showed that viruses lacking ExoN activity were more sensitive to the effects of IFN pretreatment than WT MHV. however, replication was restricted in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages but restored in IFNAR-deficient (IFNAR/BMMs) nsp14 ExoN appears to block or correct the restriction of MHV infection by an IFN-mediated mechanism that may involve damaging nascent viral RNA and affecting subsequent infectivity. RESULTS Viruses lacking ExoN activity are more sensitive to the effects of IFN- than WT MHV. encoding only an aspartic acid-to-alanine substitution in motif III [ExoN3()] Previously, we demonstrated that viruses lacking ExoN activity have decreased replication fidelity and are sensitive to the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (16). therefore, 5-FU sensitivity is an in vitro indicator of ExoN activity. ExoN() virus demonstrates an approximately 2-h delay in exponential replication and a 1-log10 decrease in peak titer relative to WT MHV (15). the replication capacity of the resulting virus exceeds that of WT MHV. sensitivity to IFN- pretreatment is not dependent on viral replication capacity. increased replication capacity does not restore virus resistance to IFN-. nsp14 ExoN activity is required for replication in wild-type B6 BMMs. BMMs from B6 or IFNAR/ mice were generated and infected with WT MHV or ExoN() virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. samples were harvested at the indicated time points, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. B6 BMMs or IFNAR/ BMMs were infected with WT MHV or ExoN() virus (A) or WT MHV or ExoN() P250 virus (B) at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. at the indicated times postinfection, cell culture supernatant aliquots were collected and the viral titers present were determined by plaque assay. SenV infection resulted in IFN expression by 3 h postinfection. it peaked between 9 and 12 h postinfection before returning nearly to mock-infected levels by 24 h postinfection. no coV infection resulted in IFN- gene expression over that of mock-infected cells. ExoN() viral titer from RL//PKR/ BMMs was detectable at 12 and 24 h postinfection. however, viral yield was minimal. loss of nsp14 ExoN activity does not lead to the transcriptional activation of IFN- or a notable dsRNA sensor such as OAS/RNase L. the averaged RNA integrity (RIN) values for each condition are reported. IFN- pretreatment did not substantially reduce subgenomic viral RNA levels at any time. exoN() viral RNA accumulation and particle release is marginally affected by IFN- pretreatment. DBT cells were pretreated with 0 or 100 U/ml mouse IFN- for 18 h. subsequently infected with WT MHV or ExoN() virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. pretreatment of DBT cells with IFN- does not grossly alter ExoN() viral RNA accumulation but reduces ExoN() viral titers. we sought to determine whether IFN pretreatment prior to infection resulted in a measurable difference in the number of viral particles released from WT MHV- or ExoN()-infected cells. the remaining cell culture supernatant volume described above was used to perform a plaque assay to determine the number of PFU present. using the number of particles determined in Fig. 5C and the number of PFU present in an equivalent volume, we calculated the specific infectivity, or particle-to-PFU ratio, of each virus generated under each condition. at 12 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were collected. for each sample, total RNA was extracted and the number of virion genome RNA copies present (particles) was determined by one-step RT-qPCR. for the second cell culture supernatant sample, the viral titer present was determined by plaque assay (PFU) the genome RNAs of the silent viruses are recognized exclusively by a probe separate from the one used to detect the nsp2 probe-binding region of WT MHV or ExoN() virus. the number of viral particles present in a representative aliquot was determined from purified virion genome RNA by one-step RT-qPCR. a loss in nsp14 ExoN activity sensitizes viruses to IFN- than WT MHV. a loss in nsp14 ExoN activity sensitizes viruses to IFN-. we pretreated murine delayed brain tumor cells with increasing concentrations of mouse IFN- for 18 h prior to infection with WT MHV or ExoN() virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU per cell. in response to IFN- pretreatment, WT MHV viral titer decreased by approximately 1 log10, as previously reported (1). ExoN() and ExoN3() displayed similar sensitivities to pretreatment with 100 or 500 U/ml IFN- following infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. therefore, these data suggest nsp14 ExoN activity is required for resistance to the effects of IFN- pretreatment. DBT cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of mouse IFN- for 18 h. ExoN() virus demonstrates an approximately 2-h delay in exponential replication and a 1-log10 decrease in peak titer relative to WT MHV (15). despite increased replication capacity, ExoN() P250 demonstrated sensitivity to IFN- pretreatment similar to that of ExoN() virus. nsp14 ExoN activity is required for replication in wild-type B6 BMMs. wild-type B6 BMMs express many PRRs and ISGs at a higher basal level than many mouse cell lines. titers increased in B6 and IFNAR/ BMMs at each time point postinfection. however, exoN() P250 virus replication in B6 BMMs was restricted and not detected beyond 9 h postinfection. exoN activity may help prevent the detection of a PAMP, namely, dsRNA, which has been shown to be increased in an nsp15 EndoU mutant. to determine whether the loss of ExoN activity resulted in the generation and subsequent detection of a PAMP. DBT cells were transfected with 0 or 50 U/ml mouse IFN- and infected with exoN() virus. as a positive control, DBT cells were transfected with 25 g/ml poly(IC), a dsRNA surrogate. at indicated times postinfection, cell lysates were harvested, total RNA extracted, and the integrity of cellular rRNA determined using a bioanalyzer. cells were mock infected with WT, ExoN(), or ExoN() virus at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell or infected with Sendai virus at an MOI of 200 HA units/ml. at the indicated times postinfection, cell culture supernatants were removed, cell lysates were harvested, cDNA was generated, and total RNA was extracted. rRNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. DBT cells were pretreated with 0 or 100 U/ml mouse IFN- for 18 h. subsequently infected with WT MHV or ExoN() virus. at indicated times postinfection, total cell lysates were harvested. the viral genomic RNA copies present relative to an RNA standard were determined by one-step RT-qPCR (A) or cDNA was generated and the subgenomic RNA copies relative to those of GAPDH were determined by qPCR (B). for each of panels A and B, error bars represent SEM (n = 6 to 9). cell culture supernatants were harvested and aliquots of two equal volumes were removed. RNA was extracted and used to perform one-step RT-qPCR to determine the number of genome RNAs present. the second volume was saved for a plaque assay as described below. oN() virus resulted in a particle-to-PFU ratio similar to that for WT MHV. exoN() virus generated in the presence of an IFN--mediated antiviral state requires 10-fold more genome RNA-containing particles to generate 1 PFU than WT MHV generated in untreated cells. these data suggest that the IFN-mediated restriction of ExoN() virus occurs at the level of subsequent infection by reducing particle infectivity. DBT cells were pretreated with 0 or 100 U/ml mouse IFN- for 18 h. at 12 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were harvested for each virus and treatment group. the number of virion genome RNA copies present in the supernatant was determined by one-step RT-qPCR. at 24 h postcoinfection total cell culture supernatants were collected. the number of viral particles present in a representative aliquot was determined from purified virion genome RNA by one-step RT-qPCR. a loss in nsp14 ExoN activity sensitizes viruses to IFN pretreatment. this reduces the infectivity and fitness of progeny during subsequent rounds of infection in the absence of an antiviral state. a loss in nsp14 ExoN activity sensitizes viruses to IFN pretreatment. we observed neither IFN- upregulation nor RNase L activation. rRNA was intact at all time points tested (Fig. 4A and B) rRNA was intact at all time points tested. a TGEV nsp14 zinc finger mutant modulated the innate immune response of swine testis cells by reducing the levels of dsRNA and induction of IFN. this is not the first report of nonviable ExoN active-site mutants in alphacoronaviruses. this suggests a common innate immune antagonism function for nsp14. in IFNAR/ BMMs, ExoN() and ExoN() P250 virus replication capacity was restored to levels approaching or exceeding WT MHV levels. further, our specific infectivity (Fig. 6A) and coinfection (Fig. 6B) data show that ExoN() virus generated in the presence of an antiviral state is less viable upon subsequent infection. poliovirus may upregulate an ISG that acts to hypermutate the large CoV genome in the absence of ExoN activity. another ISG, SAMHD1, may inhibit HIV replication by limiting nucleotide pools, a known contributor to increased viral mutation frequency. murine delayed brain tumor cells (38) and baby hamster kidney 21 cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) (39) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) and 0.25 g/ml of amphotericin B (Corning) inocula were removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. cell culture supernatants were collected at 12 h postinfection. cell culture supernatants were collected at 12 h postinfection. inocula were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. total RNA present in the lysates was purified using the phenol-chloroform method. total RNA from all samples was purified using the PureLink RNA mini purification system. a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions from 103 to 108 copies. mouse IFN- was infected with virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. after incubation, inocula were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using 1 g of total RNA. at 12 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were removed and 100 l of supernatant was added to 900 l TRIzol reagent. at 12 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells (38) and baby hamster kidney 21 cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) (39) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B (Cor subconfluent DBT cells were treated for 18 h with the indicated concentrations of mouse IFN- (PBL Assay Science) prior to infection with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU per cell at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. cell culture supernatants were collected at 12 h postinfection, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay (15). subconfluent monolayers of DBT cells were treated with 0 or 50 U/ml mouse IFN- for 18 h prior to being infected with virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. after incubation, inocula were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. total RNA present in the lysates was purified using the phenol-chloroform method. cells were transfected with 25 g/ml poly(I:C) (Sigma) using Lipofectamine 2000. total RNA was purified using the PureLink RNA mini purification system. quantification of viral genomic RNA has been previously described.
