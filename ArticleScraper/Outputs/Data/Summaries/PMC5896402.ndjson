{"summary": "cancer-induced muscle wasting is one of the hallmarks of cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome that represents one of the most important comorbidities in oncologic patients. the occurrence of cachexia markedly complicates the management of cancer patients, negatively impinging on the tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatments, worsening the quality of life. the loss of muscle mass is likely exacerbated by anticancer treatments. different mechanisms have been proposed to lead to muscle wasting in cancer hosts. reduced calorie intake, hormonal unbalance, and systemic inflammation may contribute to these alterations. main catabolic pathways contributing to protein breakdown in cancer cachexia. both experimental and human cancer cachexia were associated with increased activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. alterations in molecular and biochemical markers of proteasome activation were observed in gastric cancer patients. proinflammatory cytokines act as triggers, or at least as contributors, of cancer-induced protein hypercatabolism [23]. proinflammatory cytokines act as triggers, or at least as contributors, of cancer-induced protein hypercatabolism [23]. cancer-induced muscle wasting has also been associated with another proinflammatory cytokine, namely, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) [27] the therapeutic approaches mainly pursued by researchers have long been those specifically targeting the different proteolytic systems. the results did not really clarify the issue. mib, an irreversible selective inhibitor of proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity, was shown to improve cachexia in tumor-bearing mice by inhibiting muscle protein breakdown. this was associated with reduced tumor burden, which could be the real mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment. pharmacological inhibition of autophagy in mice hosting the C26 tumor lead to death of the animals. anti-inflammatory approaches revealed able to improve muscle protein turnover in tumor-bearing mice. ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagic-lysosomal proteolytic systems were downregulated in formoterol-receiving animals. myofibrillar protein synthesis rates were analyzed in healthy people. no changes in whole body protein synthesis were reported in gastrointestinal cancer patients. many approaches were tested, most consisting in nutritional strategies or in molecular modulations aimed at pushing muscle metabolism towards anabolism. both ghrelin and ghrelin analogues are currently being tested in clinical trials. the administration of ghrelin to tumor-bearing animals improved food intake, body weight, lean body mass, and chemo-induced toxicity [51] both ghrelin and ghrelin analogues are currently being tested in clinical trials. plasma glutamine levels were shown to be significantly reduced in tumor-bearing rats with respect to healthy animals [55] of interest, reduced glutamine availability could activate the metabolic sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) glutamine supplementation was reported to attenuate muscle protein wasting in cancer patients [68], as well as to improve the energy balance in rats bearing the Walker 256 tumor [69]. glutamine supplementation was reported to attenuate muscle protein wasting in cancer patients [68], suggesting that the effectiveness of HMB in the clinical practice is still unclear. autophagy was not considered as typically operated by the skeletal muscle as a response to stress conditions. despite autophagic flux was enhanced in mice bearing the C26 tumor, autophagosomes accumulated, likely due to exhaustion of the lysosomal compartment [15] a similar pattern could also be observed in cancer patients. increased calpain expression was reported in the muscle of tumor-bearing animals [19], while rats transplanted with the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma showed a progressive reduction of calpastatin levels. more recently, calpain activation was also demonstrated in mice bearing the C26 colon carcinoma [21] both increased or unchanged muscle calpain expression were reported in cancer patients [12, 22] inhibition of proteasome activity by means of pharmacological inhibitors was effective in few models of muscle atrophy but totally unable to protect tumor-bearing animals against muscle wasting [30] carfilzomib, an irreversible selective inhibitor of proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity, was shown to improve cachexia in tumor-bearing mice by inhibiting muscle protein breakdown. lysosomal degradation is mandatory to sustain the requirement of both energy and substrates in tumor-bearing mice. excessive stimulation of muscle autophagy, while activation of autophagy by means of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, exacerbated muscle atrophy in tumor-bearing mice. mTOR inhibition affects stress-induced autophagy, but TP53INP2 hyperexpression targets basal autophagy. proolytic systems were downregulated in formoterol-receiving animals. the results suggest both muscle size and strength can be improved by the treatment. however, more trials are needed to draw clear-cut evidence. infusion with an amino acid cocktail did not stimulate muscle protein synthesis in tumor-bearing animals [42, 44] studies aimed at stimulating the anabolic pathway depending on IGF-1 did not succeed in improving muscle wasting in tumor-bearing animals. patients not yet considered as refractory cachectic were proposed to display anabolic window that could be exploited with nutritional interventions. free amino acids (FAA) also act as regulators of protein metabolism. plasma FAA, which represent a small fraction of the total amino acid pool, are the main source of metabolically active nitrogen compounds. several studies have proposed amino acid supplementation as a mean to improve cancer-induced muscle wasting in experimental models of cancer cachexia. the underlying mechanisms of such effect are not clear, although downregulation of protein degradation and stimulation of protein synthesis were hypothesized. a negative energy balance, generally resulting from reduced production and increased expenditure, is a frequent occurrence in cancer patients. the increased thermogenesis is consistent with the observation that in cachectic tumor-bearing animals, the expression of the brown adipose tissue-specific uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is higher than in controls, while muscle UCP3 mRNA levels were higher in weight-losing. proinflammatory cytokines play a major role in mitochondrial alterations in the skeletal muscle. oxidative stress, due to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels exceeding compensative capacity of the intracellular antioxidant systems, contributes to mitochondrial function impairment. chondria dynamics, representing the balance between fission and fusion processes, was shown to be altered in both experimental cancer cachexia and in cancer patients. impaired mitochondrial dynamics could drive hyperactivation of muscle protein breakdown, likely through pathways depending on AMPK and FoxO, eventually leading to muscle wasting. exercise mimicking drugs do not recapitulate the effects of exercise itself. the negative part is that generally exercise mimicking drugs do not recapitulate the effects of exercise itself. however, they could be a compromise when exercise training cannot be proposed to the patient. resveratrol was shown to improve sarcopenia of aging and muscle wasting in severely burned patients. AMPK1- or AMPK2-deficient mice were refractory to resveratrol-induced increase of mitochondrial biogenesis and endurance exercise capacity. resveratrol also activates SIRT1 in the skeletal muscle by AMPK. SRT2104 appears to reduce the depletion of muscle mass due to fasting or inactivity. TMZ is a metabolic modulator that blocks fatty acid oxidation. this shift to glucose oxidation improves the use of the available oxygen, possibly increasing metabolic efficiency and skeletal muscle function. a complex network of metabolic alterations sustained by hypercatabolism, energy deficit, and systemic inflammation is the milieu underlying cancer cachexia. a complex network of metabolic alterations sustained by hypercatabolism, energy deficit, and systemic inflammation is the milieu underlying cancer cachexia. this paper was published in june 2014."}
