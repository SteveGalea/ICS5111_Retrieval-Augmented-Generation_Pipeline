{"summary": "many host\u2013pathogen interactions have been characterized using genetics, biochemical, and microscopy approaches. these methods relied on mutants, pharmacological reagents, immunoprecipitations, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, cell fractionation, and Western blotting to name a few of the methods employed. this includes vaccinia virus (Krauss et al., 2002), influenza virus (Shaw et al., 2008), HIV (Gurer et al., 2002; Cantin et al., 2005; Ott, 2008), vesicular stomatitis virus (Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2009), and several herpesviruses. the presence of virion-associated host proteins host proteins were detected in all herpesvirions analyzed so far. fewer cellular proteins were reported for other viral particles. meanwhile, studies focusing on PRV and EBV reported up to 49 cellular proteins.

Actin has been reported to compensate the loss of various viral tegument proteins in PRV (del Rio et al., 2005; Michael et al., 2006) it may thus act as an abundant filling agent, so its significance in herpesviral particles remains enigmatic. the presence of translation initiation or elongation factors in virions may also jumpstart gene expression in favor of the viruses. apoptosis is regulated both negatively and positively by several viruses. the relative abundance of a peptide is itself influenced by the complexity of the samples, where some proteins may evade identification. sensitivity of the mass spectrometers and abundance of the proteins in the samples also influence peptide detection. RNA interference also has its own caveats (false positives and negatives) host proteins may be essential for the cells and their depletion may lead to cytotoxicity, thus proper controls are needed. animal models may miss important players, for example modulators of the immune system or virulence factors. the proteomics of viral particles is only the beginning of the adventure. the author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
