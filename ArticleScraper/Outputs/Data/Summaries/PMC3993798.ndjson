{"summary": "the first attempts to produce a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus began 5 decades ago. it culminated in a pediatric clinical trial in the 1960s in which RSV was inactivated with formalin and administered to RSV-naive infants. the vaccine exacerbated disease when vaccine recipients were infected with RSV (1). a potential target population for an Ad5-vectored RSV vaccine still exists among infants 4 to 23 months old who present with limited adenoviral preformed active immunity. the seroprevalence of human adenovirus serotypes 2 and 5 circulating in different age groups supports the knowledge that antiadenoviral neutralizing immunity is present in newborns. cotton rats (CRs) have been used for years as an excellent small-animal model of RSV vaccine-enhanced disease. we describe the development of a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing codon-optimized RSV-F as a vaccine candidate. HEK293 cells were transfected with pAd/RSV-F or pAd using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), or A549 cells were seeded in six-well plates. cells were harvested, triedpsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with monoclonal antibody against RSV-F. CRs were injected with various doses of the replication-defective adenovirus vaccine via the intramuscular (i.m. or i.n. route. for the prime-boost regimen, 100 l of vaccine containing 1 1011 v.p. was administered i.n. 4 weeks after an i.m. dose. CRs were immunized by the i.m. route only with one (day 0) or two (day 0 and 28) doses of Ad5.RSV-F. formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV/A/Burnett in 100 l of 1:10-diluted vaccine was injected i.m. as a positive histopathology control. filtered formaldehyde was diluted and added to the suspension. suspension was rotated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h and pelleted at 22,000 rpm for 30 min. pellet was resuspended with MEM to 1/25 of the original volume. fluids were collected and stored on ice until titrated. plaques in wells containing between 20 and 100 plaques were enumerated. the average was obtained, and virus titers were calculated. summary scores for each animal in a group were expressed as the arithmetic mean standard deviation (SD) each animal in a group was mixed 1:1 either with PBS or with cotton rat serum pooled from each group and serially diluted 4-fold in triplicate. each BMAb was tested against serial dilutions. homologous, unlabeled MAb and against an anti-PIV3-F MAb. antibody mixtures were added to blocked and washed antigen plates. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h prior to washing. optical density (OD405) was subtracted from OD values obtained for all antibody-containing wells. significance was determined at a P value of 0.050. the sums of the areas of involvement and severity scores were used for analysis of the histopathology data. pAd/RSV-F was codon optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells. cells were harvested, triedpsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline. cells were stained with monoclonal antibody against RSV-F (131-2A) or mouse antiserum against Ad5.RSV-F. phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antimouse secondary antibody. CRs (five or six animals per group) were injected with various doses of the replication-defective adenovirus vaccine via the intramuscular (i.m.) or i.n. route. i.m. immunization was performed by injection of 100 l of vaccine containing 1 1011 v.p. into the area of the left tibialis anterior leg muscle using a tuberculin syringe. all CRs were challenged i.n. with 2.25 105 PFU of RSV/A/Tracy. CRs were euthanized on day 4 or 7 postchallenge. preparation and isolation of RSV/A/Tracy from HEp-2 cells were performed. hydroxide (4 mg/ml) was added to the FI RSV 25. the mixture was gently rotated for 12 h at 4\u00b0C. pellet was resuspended with MEM to 1/100 of the original volume. ers were calculated as the total log10 number of PFU for nasal wash fluid. the lower limit of detection by this method was approximately 0.40 log10 total PFU in nasal wash fluid specimens. both lungs were isolated intact, rinsed, and perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin. BMAbs were titrated on monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells infected with RSV A2. antigen plates were blocked with 20% goat serum\u20135% nonfat dried milk. each BMAb was mixed 1:1 either with PBS or with cotton rat serum pooled from each group and serially diluted 4-fold in triplicate. each BMAb was tested against serial dilutions of homologous, unlabeled MAb and against an anti-PIV optical density (OD) readings at 405 nm (OD405) were obtained using an ELISA plate reader. the mean value for blank wells (i.e., antibody-free wells with no competitor antibody and/or no BMAb) was subtracted from OD values for all antibody-containing wells. s encoding a codon-optimized RSV rA2cp F protein using the UpGene algorithm. as expected, the expression level of F protein was much lower than that of the codon-optimized ORF. recombinant adenoviral vaccines were evaluated in A549 cells after infection of Ad5.RSV-F. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 5 1010 v.p. of Ad5.RSV-F. at 3 weeks after immunization, sera from all mice were pooled and tested for RSV-F-specific antibodies. a monoclonal antibody against RSV-F was used for detection of RSV-F expression at the cell surface. an F/85-93 epitope-specific CD8 T-cell response was detected in mice vaccinated with Ad5.RSV-F. lymphocytes from mice given Ad5 without the insert did not respond. we then investigated the immunogenicity of the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine candidate in CRs. a single i.n. dose of Ad5.RSV-F (group 6) also produced a robust serum neutralizing response on day 56 that was approximately 32-fold greater than that produced by experimental infection. untreated CRs and CRs given Ad5.PIV3-HN (group 3) had no detectable neutralizing antibody response to RSV. the results represent the mean SD for six animals per group. zero plaques were counted as 0.40 log10 total PFU in nasal wash fluid specimens. a dose escalation regimen was tested in the CR model. animals were vaccinated with 1 108, 1 109, 1 1010, and 1 1011 v.p. of the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine. a single i.m. dose of Ad5.RSV-F vaccine at any potency tested produced protective levels of serum neutralizing antibody and effectively reduced RSV/A/Tracy replication in the lungs and, to a lesser extent, in the nose. CRs received 1 109 or 1 1011 v.p. of Ad5.RSV-F i.m. in either one (day 0) or two (day 0 and day 28) vaccinations. FI RSV/A/Burnett vaccine was used as a positive control for enhanced lung pathology following RSV challenge. RSV-F neutralizing antibody titers against RSV/A/Tracy and RSV/B/18537 were measured on day 63 by determining the highest dilution inhibiting RSV infection by 50%. results are expressed as the geometric mean titer and standard deviation (log2). lungs from CRs immunized with the FI RSV/A/Burnett vaccine were used as the positive control. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 anti-F-protein BMAbs B1121 (site A), B1129 (palivizumab parent, site A), B1107 (site AB), B1269 (site B), and B1243 (site C), which bind antigenic sites A, B, and C. sera from individual animals from each group were pooled and tested for the ability to inhibit the binding of biotinylated anti-F-protein or anti-G-protein monoclonal antibodies to anti BMAbs B1121 (anti-F protein, site A), B1129 (palivizumab parent, anti-F protein, site A), B1107 (anti-F protein, site AB), B1243 (anti-F protein, site C), and B104-5 (anti-G protein subtype A) were used for competition at 50% saturation. each BMAb was mixed 1:1 either with PBS or with cotton rat serum. we compared the expression of wild-type F protein and codon-optimized F protein. expression level of F protein was much lower than that of the codon-optimized ORF. recombinant adenoviral vaccines were evaluated in A549 cells after infection of Ad5.RSV-F. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 5 1010 v.p. of Ad5.RSV-F. recombinant adenoviral vaccines could elicit an antigen-specific immune response in vivo. ELISPOT assays measuring IFN- secretion were performed to determine T-cell responses specific to RSV-F in immunized mice. an F/85-93 epitope-specific CD8 T-cell response was detected in mice vaccinated with Ad5.RSV-F, while lymphocytes from mice given Ad5 without the insert did not respond when stimulated with this peptide. i.n. boosting with Ad5.RSV-F on day 28 significantly increased the neutralizing antibody responses on day 56 in CRs primed by i.m. injection. a single i.n. dose of Ad5.RSV-F (group 6) also produced a robust serum neutralizing response on day 56 that was approximately 32-fold greater than that produced by experimental infection. cotton rats were challenged intranasally with 1.22 105 PFU RSV/A/Tracy titers were determined on HEp-2 cells by standard plaque assay. the results represent the mean SD for six animals per group. a boost immunization (group 5) was able to induce RSV sterilization of the nasal turbinates (P 0.0001). results indicate that mucosal immunization with the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine candidate is highly effective in preventing RSV/A/Tracy virus replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. antibodies were measured, with no adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies being detected at doses of 1 108 or 1 109 v.p. however, detectable responses were observed in CRs immunized at the two high doses. a single i.m. dose of the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine at any potency tested effectively reduced RSV/A/Tracy replication in the lungs and, to a lesser extent, in the nose. CRs received 1 109 or 1 1011 v.p. of Ad5.RSV-F i.m. in either one (day 0) or two (day 0 and day 28) vaccinations. the FI RSV/A/Burnett vaccine was used as a positive control for enhanced lung pathology following RSV challenge. activity of sera from cotton rats immunized i.m. with 1 109 and 1 1011 v.p. once or 1 1011 v.p. and FI RSV/A/Burnett twice i.m. is shown. results are expressed as the geometric mean titer and standard deviation (log2). filtrates Bronchiolitis Bronchiolar eosinophilia Alveolitis Alveolar eosinophilia Perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates Mean for all parameters Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Severity Area Sever palivizumab is a humanized antigen targeting antigenic site A. fda-approved prophylactic antibody that prevents severe RSV disease. sera from individual animals from each group were pooled and tested. sera from group 5 (given Ad5.RSV-F i.m. followed by Ad5.RSV-F i.n. only) significantly inhibited binding of BMAbs 1129, 1107, and 1269. sera from group 6 (given Ad5.RSV-F i.n. only) significantly inhibited binding of BMAbs B1129 and B1269. recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 strain encoding the codon-optimized ORFs of the fusion protein of RSV (Ad5.RSV-F) leads to a protective immune response without vaccine-related enhanced respiratory disease following an early experimental RSV challenge. this study did not assess whether Ad5.RSV-F induced a prolonged duration of protection. SV-F or soluble F antigen showed a protective immune response to RSV in a mouse model (32, 33) we used the CR model to investigate the immunogenicity, efficacy, and enhanced disease potential of the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine candidate. i.n. versus i.m. immunization on day 0 with challenge on day 56 is robust. a single dose at a low v.p. concentration of Ad5.RSV-F vaccine (108 or 109 v.p.) was able to induce a humoral response comparable to that seen following experimental RSV infection. the humoral response was further characterized to determine if antibodies elicited following Ad5.RSV-F immunization bound to previously identified neutralization epitopes on RSV-F. in sera from animals given a single dose of Ad5.RSV-F i.m. or i.n. these observations suggest induction of epitope spreading and somatic maturation of the antibody response following prime-boost immunization. however, further investigations are necessary to better define the effect of sequential immunization on the antibody repertoire. our studies of the Ad5.RSV-F vaccine in mice demonstrated elicitation of both the B-cell response and an F/85-93 epitope-specific T-cell response. recombinant adenovirus expressing the codon-optimized RSV-F gene provides protective immunity against RSV challenge without enhanced lung pathology."}
