{"summary": "retinoic acid-inducible gene-I selectively sense cytoplasmic viral RNA to induce an antiviral immune response. the absence of RIG-I in chickens raises the question of whether this protein influences the antiviral immune response against IBV infection. candidate reference gene mRNA was amplified by real-time PCR. the transcriptional stability of the candidate reference genes was measured using geNorm and NormFinder software. the most stably expressed genes have lower M values. in the lung chMDA5, chIFN-, chIFN- and chMx transcription was normalized to ACTB (1), TUBAT (2) and RPL5 (3) respectively. data are shown as the mean SD."}
