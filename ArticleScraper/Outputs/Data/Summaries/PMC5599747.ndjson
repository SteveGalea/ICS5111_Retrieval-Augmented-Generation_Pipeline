{"summary": "several zoonotic coronaviruses have expanded their host range into humans over the last 800 years. the virus originated in bats and spread into human populations by the use of camels as an intermediate host species (7, 8). the exact origins of the virus remain unclear. several mouse models have recently been developed to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo. these include a model employing adeno-associated virus delivery of hDPP4 (18), overexpression or knock-in of hDPP4 (20\u201323), and gene editing to generate mice carrying a chimeric mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) gene (24). the inability of MERS-CoV to infect these species is restricted, as is the ability to evaluate drugs and vaccine introducing mutations A288L and T330R allows mDPP4 to act as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV infection. the mutation helps stabilize a hydrophobic core in the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) shown to be important for proper binding to DPP4 (29). mDPP4 acting as a functional receptor only when the glycan is absent (19). hDPP4, bDPP4, and cDPP4 orthologs are classified as permissive or nonpermissive (mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig) orthologs categorized as nonpermissive have levels of infection that are not significantly different from those seen when no DPP4 is present. each DPP4 ortholog was measured in triplicate. only hDPP4, bDPP4, and cDPP4 had levels of infection significantly higher than hDPP4 (*, P 0.05 [Student's t test]). hDPP4 (yellow) complexed with the MERS-CoV RBD (red) (PDB code 4L72) hDPP4 (yellow) complexed with fDPP4 (green), haDPP4 (blue) and gpDPP4 (purple) orthologs suggest they can likely act as backbones to support MERS-CoV infection. a total of eight N-linked glycans are known to be present in the extracellular domain of hDPP4 (29) predictive software estimates that there are 7 to 11 putative glycosylation sites for each of the DPP4 orthologs analyzed in this study. PP4 receptor used in this study (from Pipistrellus pipistrellus pipistrellus) causing us to hypothesize that host restriction might be mediated by differences in the sequence or structure of gpDPP4 that are independent of this glycosylation site. all residues are numbered relative to the given DPP4 molecule. removing glycosylation from these three DPP4 orthologs did not result in an increase in infection. the levels of infection supported by all three glycosylation knockout molecules were not significantly different from those seen with the respective wild-type DPP4 molecules (P 0.05 [Student's t test]) the level of each DPP4 ortholog was measured in triplicate. only hDPP4 had levels of infection significantly higher than those seen in the absence of DPP4. the remaining DPP4 orthologs and glycosylation knockouts had infection levels that were not significantly different from those seen in the absence of DPP4. introducing select human amino acids into the mDPP4 sequence on blade V (A288L) acts to support MERS-CoV infection in combination with the blade IV glycosylation knockout (N328A) in the case of haDPP4, the L288 amino acid identity is conserved between the hamster and human sequences. this suggests that different determinants in haDPP4 and mDPP4 are responsible for blocking MERS-CoV infection. species-specific differences in blade V of haDPP4 are also responsible for haDPP4's inability to act as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV infection. many amino acid changes are required to make fDPP4 and haDPP4 permissive to MERS-CoV infection. combining three amino acid changes on blade V with the glycosylation knockout mutant on blade IV resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV infection. each DPP4 ortholog was measured in triplicate. hDPP4, fDPP4 (278) (330), and haDPP4 (289) gly had levels of infection that were significantly greater than those seen in the absence of DPP4. mDPP4 amino acids 247 to 504 allowed fDPP4 to support MERS-CoV infection. but no mutations were identified that could recapitulate the susceptible phenotype. we mutated residues on blade V and tried them in combination with the blade IV glycosylation knockout mutant (n331A) gpDPP4 and fDPP4 do not share their glycosylation sites with permissive molecules. removing glycosylation from bDPP4 caused no statistically significant change in its ability to support MERS-CoV infection. future studies are needed to determine whether changes on both blade IV and blade IV of gpDPP4 can confer permissivity. bDPP4, bDPP4, and bDPP4 gly had levels of infection that are significantly higher than those seen in the absence of DPP4. gpDPP4 and gpDPP4 gly had levels of infection that are significantly higher than those seen in the absence of DPP4. ror bars indicate mean values 1 standard deviation. the interactions between the virus spike and host cell receptor are crucial for mediating infection and for acting as a barrier for nonpermissive species. but viruses often overcome species barriers to expand host range. rat ACE2 is not permissive to SARS-CoV. introduction of a glycosylation site combined with a point mutation allows rat ACE2 to support SARS-CoV infection (43) this results highlight glycosylation as a key determinant of receptor species specificity for numerous coronaviruses. sylation site in bDPP4 did not affect its ability to support MERS-CoV infection. this suggests that the impact of the bDPP4 blade IV glycosylation site on receptor permissivity may be species specific. this suggests that further research should be performed to elucidate the additional changes that might allow gpDPP4 to act as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV. access to the crystal structures of these DPP4 orthologs would enable us to model changes in the MERS-CoV RBD that would allow the virus to successfully infect nonpermissive species. the generation of a transgenic small-animal model in these alternative species would require extensive genomic editing due to the number of mutations needed for each DPP4. permissivity data are indicated in the far right column, with green squares indicating permissive species and red squares indicating nonpermissive species, based on either in vitro or in vivo data (10\u201317). shaded colors indicate the group each species falls in. current data would postulate that all nonhuman primates are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. but testing this hypothesis in vitro would help reveal whether any of these orthologs are nonpermissive. a mechanism other than glycosylation at our location of interest would be responsible for blocking MERS-CoV infection. further research to determine whether these other orthologs are permissive can help elucidate whether this region plays a broader role in the MERS-CoV infection susceptibility phenotype. more data on species permissivity will help determine whether DPP4 phylogenetic relationships can help inform receptor binding dynamics. rMERS-CoV-RFP tagged with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-CoV-RFP) was engineered on the basis of the EMC2012 substrain. all recombinants were produced and studied under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions.
