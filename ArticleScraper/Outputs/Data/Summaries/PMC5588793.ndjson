{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum is the site for quality control of misfolded proteins and entry point of extracellular proteins to the secretory pathway. only 50% of the proteins used as training data had endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which shows that these signals are not present in all endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins. ERPred was developed to make the method available to the scientific community. out of 124 proteins of the training dataset, only 66 proteins had endoplasmic reticulum retention signals. this observation strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. secretory proteins are synthesized on rough ER and route across the ER membrane into lumen through a co-translational process. inside the ER, they undergo glycosylation and attain their specific 3D conformation before being further transported downstream in the secretory system. proteins, which help ER in carrying out above-mentioned functions, do not get secreted. the dilysine motif known as KKxx and KxKxx motifs consists of a pair of lysine residues at the C terminus of the cargo protein. many variants of the dilysine motif have been reported such as KxHxx retrieval motif in the tail of the spike protein. no attempt has been made to develop species neutral ERRPs predictor. ER has been included as a location, but at present, a predictor does not exist. ER has been included as a location, but at present, a predictor does not exist. ERPred is based on the support vector machine (SVM) and the individual amino acid compositions of 25 N-terminal, 25 C-terminal and remaining amino acids as SVM input. we have developed a freely accessible webserver and software that predicts ERRPs using their amino acid sequence. both types of non-ERRPs were downloaded using the criteria earlier used to download ER proteins. proteins downloaded may contain similar or homologous sequences. redundancy was reduced to 40% using CD-HIT (Li & Godzik, 2006) and 124 ERRPs were obtained. removing sequences, which had a redundancy of more than 40% among independent or with the training dataset, we got 65 proteins. the non-ERRPs were also downloaded from SwissProt using following filters: (i) protein length should be greater than 50 amino acids; (ii) protein should be of eukaryotic origin and non-membranous. support vector machine SVM is a machine-learning algorithm to carry out pattern recognition and regression analysis on a given dataset. During training, SVM maps input data to the higher dimension and generates model, which can be used for prediction of an unknown example. During training, SVM needs only fixed-length feature along with their class as input. prediction performance of trained model was calculated by averaging over all test set predictions. sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) used standard parameters regularly used in other prediction methods. Pseudo amino acid composition of a protein is actually a set of discrete numbers, which is derived from its amino acid sequence. it allows representation of both compositional and positional amino acid pattern in a discrete mode. it also reflects sequence order information and length of the proteins. membrane protein prediction, ion channels prediction, protein fold prediction, heat shock protein and its class prediction. dipeptide composition calculates the number of all possible types of amino acid pairs in a protein sequence in a sliding window mode with step size 1 and window size 2. in 2-parts-split amino acid (SAAC-2-parts), first we divided each sequence in two different ways. we named these two split sets as N-terminal SAAC (N-ter-SAAC) and C-terminal SAAC (C-ter-SAAC) respectively. the dataset that has to be used for training the predictor should contain experimentally annotated proteins of high quality. we used following criteria (i) proteins should be of eukaryotic origin and reviewed; (ii) should be present only in ER; (iii) existence proven by \u2018evidence at protein level\u2019; (iv) protein should be full length and not fragmented; (vi) protein location should be experimentally verified. 1,200 eukaryotic non-ERRPs were used as the negative dataset. the 1,200 non-ER proteins were 10 times the positive dataset. the source of ERRPs was also SwissProt (Release: 2015_06) we removed the low quality annotation by excluding sequences annotated as \u2018by similarity\u2019, \u2018fragment\u2019, \u2018uncertain\u2019 sequences from the dataset. the dataset obtained from above described step was made non-redundant by using CD-HIT program with 40% threshold after which we got 13,271 sequences. cross-validation is a way to estimate the performance of a prediction model during training. whole data is divided into two distinct sets. one set (called as training set) is used to train the model and second set (called as test set) is used for performance evaluation of model on a dataset that was not used during training. TP represents true positive (proteins, which are actually ERRPs and also predicted as non-ERRPs), FP represents false positive (the number of non-ERRP predicted as ERRPs), FN represents false negative (the number of proteins, which are actually ERRPs but predicted as non-ERRPs) Pseudo amino acid composition of a protein is actually a set of discrete numbers, which is derived from its amino acid sequence. it allows representation of both compositional and positional amino acid pattern in a discrete mode. it also reflects sequence order information and length of the proteins. dipeptide composition describes each protein sequence in form of 400-dimension feature vectors, which can be calculated as Dipep n = Total number of Dipep n Total number of all possible dipeptide p 100 (6) where Dipep(n) is the percentage of dipeptide \u2018n\u2019 in a given protein and (n) can be any dipeptides out of the all possible 400 dipeptides of a particular protein (p) N-ter-SAAC had protein sequences in two parts, (i) 25 amino acids of N-terminal and (ii) the remaining residues of the sequence. for both N-ter-SAAC and C-ter-SAAC, we calculated amino acid composition of each part separately. the fractional difference between distribution of a particular amino acid in query (d1) and background dataset (d2) is calculated as follows. aromatic (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan), negatively charged (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) residues were enriched while positively charged (arginine) residues were depleted. dipeptide composition based module is better than simple amino acid and dipeptide composition based modules. results show that pseudo-amino acid composition based module is better than simple amino acid and dipeptide composition based modules. ROC curve is a graphical way to illustrate the performance of a classifier. it is plotted as \u2018sensitivity\u2019 vs. \u20181-specificity\u2019. the area under the ROC curve is called AUC value (Bradley, 1997). signal dependent proteins have ER-retention signals while signal independent proteins do not have these signals, e.g. some cereal prolamin storage proteins. in order to find out the efficiency of signal based approach, we evaluated ER retention signal based prediction of ERRPs using Prosite motif database. ERPred correctly predicted the non-ERRPs with 83.69% specificity. this shows that the mere presence or absence of ER-retention signal does not necessarily implies ERRP or non-ERRP respectively. each protein out of 124 was used as query and remaining 123 proteins as database. at e-value threshold 1e 3, only 56 proteins found ERRP as first BLAST hit. oc-Animal (Yu et al., 2006), Cello v.2.5 (Yu et al., 2006), Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007), Euk-mPloc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010), HybridGO-Loc (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2014), mGOASVM (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2012), Hum-Ploc (Chou & ERPred performed better in prediction of ERRPs but its performance in terms of specificity or non-ERRPs was lesser than other predictors. in most cases, they were predicting locations other than ER, due to which their overall efficiency was higher. if we carefully analyse the results, it can be observed that their performance is not equally good for the prediction of ERRPs. ERPred predicted 1,014 proteins as ERRPs out of 26,109 proteins. 3.88% of the proteome and 148 proteins are ERRPs out of 5,450 proteins. er-GolgiDB contains information about ER and Golgi localization. the ERPred estimated the existence of 2,293 ERRPs in human. the estimated number was close to the 2,543 and 1,762 proteins of ER-GolgiDB and Locate databases respectively. in mouse, ERPred estimated 1,781 proteins (3.94% of the proteome) ERRPs were merged into a single group as a query sample. aromatic (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan), negatively charged (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) residues were enriched while positively charged (arginine) residues were depleted. these results show that pseudo-amino acid composition based SVM module is better than simple amino acid and dipeptide composition based modules. the performance obtained from different SVM models can be explained by the fact that retention of proteins inside ER is mediated by some signal sequences or related sequences. the maximum accuracy was 73.34% (MCC = 0.29) when information of amino acids arrangement order was provided in form of pseudo amino acid composition based input, prediction accuracy increased to 74.85% (MCC = 0.30) pseudo amino acid composition based module is better than simple amino acid and dipeptide composition based modules. MCC and AUC represent Matthews\u2019s correlation coefficient and area under ROC curve, respectively. with N-ter-SAAC, we found maximum accuracy 79.53% with MCC value 0.37. with C-ter-SAAC the accuracy reduced to 71.07% and MCC value to 0.27. but with SAAC-3-parts, the accuracy increased to 81.42% with MCC value 0.42. classifier based on SAAC-3 parts is better than classifiers developed using other sequence encapsulations. AAC, PsedoAAC, Dipeptide, N-ter-SAAC, C-ter-SAAC and SAAC-3-parts represents amino acid composition, pseudo-amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, 25 N-terminal and remaining amino acid composition. signal independent proteins do not have these signals. we analysed 65 ERRPs of independent dataset for presence of ER-retention signal by ScanProsite. only 21 proteins had ER-signal while remaining 44 proteins did not have any ER-signal. 27 proteins were predicted as ERRPs and 17 as non-ERRPs. 'homology based function transfer' involves BLASTing novel gene/protein against a gene and/or protein database to find well-annotated homolog(s) and transfer the annotation of top hit(s) to the query proteins. our method detects ERRPs with high sensitivity but also recognizes non-ERRPs with high specificity. there is no existing method which can specifically predict ERRPs. proLoc-GO (Huang et al., 2008), KnowPredsite (Lin et al., 2009) were not found in a working state. sensitivity of ERPred on independent dataset was 72.31% with 83.69% specificity. for Cello v.2.5 the corresponding values were 16.92% and 99.86% respectively. for iLoc-Euk the sensitivity and specificity was 15.38% and 99.76% respectively. annotation of proteome We selected six different proteomes ranging from less complex yeast to the most complex human. ERPred predicted 2,293 proteins as ERRP, which is 3.34% of the proteome. in case of M. musculus, ERPred predicted 1,781 ERRPs out of 45,185. ER-GolgiDB contains information about ER and Golgi localization based on sequence homology to experimentally annotated proteins. ER-GolgiDB contains information about subcellular localization based on sequence homology. the maximum limit of prediction is 25 sequences at a time. if a user submits more than 25 sequences, only the first 25 sequences will be processed for prediction. ERPred also provides option to select different threshold values. we used SAAC in which a protein sequence was divided into three different ways. N-ter-SAAC contained two sets of amino acid compositions. C-ter-SAAC also had two sets of amino acid compositions. the most surprising result we obtained was the performance of dipeptide composition based SVM models, which has shown least performance among all. this also suggests that other parts of proteins also play a very important role in retention of ERRPs in ER.
