{"summary": "Background Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the coronavirus of domestic chickens that causes acute, highly contagious respiratory disease. it is one of the most important causes of economic loss in the poultry industry. nucleocapsid (N) protein interacts with genomic RNA of the virus to form the viral nucleocapsid. proteins S, E, and M have been studied for their important roles in receptor binding and virus budding. enveloped viruses constantly adapt to and modulate the host environment. s disease virus (MDV) [10], EBV [11], human cyotomegalovirus (HCMV) [12], murine cyotomegalovirus (MCMV) [13] and vacciniavirus have also contributed to a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. no study of the host proteins in the virions of coronavirus has been performed yet. two distinct types of IBV particles were isolated by sucrose density gradients. higher density particles banded at 30%-40% sucrose-TNE gradients. less density particles banded at 20%-30% sucrose-TNE gradients. purity of IBV was confirmed by electron microscopy analysis. chick embryo-grown major particles H52 from 30%-40% sucrose density gradients, negatively stained with 2% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 6.5. western blot with chicken polyclonal antibody against infectious bronchitis virus (Massachusetts) the identified host proteins were comprised of cytoskeleton proteins, molecular chaperone, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, signal transport proteins and glycolytic enzymes. these host proteins were located mainly in the cytoplasm, including cytoskeleton, cytosol and mitochondrion. actin, tubulin and annexin A2 were both found in the purified virions and positive control but not in the AF extracts from uninfected 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. in present study, we detected it only in the purified virions but not in normal cells. protease treatment of the purified virus preparation strips proteins off any contaminating microvesicles and off the outside of virus particles. proteins that are inside the virion are protected by the lipid envelope and therefore will remain after the protease treatment. immunogold labeling of the purified virions was performed. the virions were negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate. they were then blocked with 5% BSA in PBS-Tween 20 (pH 7.4) for 30 min at RT. the purity of IBV was confirmed by electron microscopy. an abundance of intact virions were observed without obvious contamination from host cellular materia. proteins in purified virions were separated on 12% Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stained withc coomassie brilliant blue. the viral protein profiles were analyzed by 2-D with 250 g of protein. gels were stained with silver and processed for image analysis. 88 protein spots were detected for IBV particle-associated proteins separated in the pH3-10 range. IBV preparation purified from AF was analyzed for the presence of host proteins. extracts from 10-day-old specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs were included as a positive control. the challenge is to prove that the host proteins are really an part of the virion and that they are not just attached non-specifically to the outside of the virus. 8 g of purified virions from allantoic fluid (lane 1) and 15 g of proteins extracted either from the normal 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chick embryo(CEL)(lane 2) or from the AF of the uninfected 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were subjected to western blot analysis. we used the bromelain protease protection assay which has been shown to efficiently remove micro the abundance of actin, annexin A2 present on the virions is much higher than that of HSP90. virions were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at RT. virions were negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate. a total of 2 viral and 60 host proteins associated with purified IBV particles were identified. in the present study, we failed to obtain M and E protein. other two structural proteins N and S were identified successfully. several of the highly abundant cytosolic proteins found in both IBV and other viral particles are beta actin, tubulin, annexins and enolase. some host proteins may be specially incorporated into the virions. 21 of the total host proteins are reported for the first time. all group II chaperonins in eukaryotic cytosolic cytosolic chaperonins have been found to interact either in vitro or in vivo with other cytoskeletal proteins. some viral proteins such as the Epstein Barr virus-encoded nuclear protein (EBNA-3), the hepatitis B virus capsid and the type D retrovirus Gag polyprotein are also folded by CCT. heat-shock proteins (HSPs) have been known as multifunctional proteins. they facilitate the folding and unfolding of proteins, prevent protein aggregation in the densely packed cytosol and are involved in signaling processes. most, but not all, HSPs are molecular chaperones. a role for HSP90 in the control of hepatitis C, flock house and influenza virus polymerase function has been shown [55-61] the importance of HSP90 for the replication of multiple viruses opens up an interesting possibility for developing new antiviral therapies. some proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway were identified. in vitro data indicates that GAPDH serves a negative regulatory role in hPIV3 transcription and in a phosphorylation-dependent on manner. in vitro data indicates that GAPDH serves a negative regulatory role in hPIV3 transcription and in a phosphorylation-dependent on manner. chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) binds to a negative regulatory region in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.
