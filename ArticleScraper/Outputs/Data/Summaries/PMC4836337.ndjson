{"summary": "the annual loss to the U.S. swine industry associated with PRRS has been estimated to be approximately 664 million USD (7). PRRSV is a small, enveloped virus, with a single-stranded, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 15 kb in length. nsp7, nsp7, and nsp8 encoded in ORF1a and 4 nsp's (nsp9 to nsp12) encoded in ORF1b (17, 18, 20) through proteolysis regulated by viral proteases nsp1, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp4. eight other short 3\u2032-proximal ORFs (ORF2a, ORF2b ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride hydrochloride hydrate have been successfully used in a number of previous studies as an antiviral compound against different viruses. these antiviral mutagens maintained lethal mutagenesis by increasing the mutation frequency of RNA viruses above the tolerable error threshold during replication, ultimately driving virus infections into extinction. the pigs were euthanized, and their lungs, tracheas, and bronchi were aseptically extracted. the extracted lungs were flushed two to three times with a total volume of 200 to 300 ml sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) both MARC-145 cells and PAMs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS mutant viruses (RVRp13 and RVRp22) were rescued through the serial passaging of VR2332 (a prototype strain of North American PRRSV) both mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, were evaluated in terms of their genetic stability during replication in pigs. each virus (RVRp13, RVRp22, and MLV) was purified by three rounds of plaque purification in MARC-145 cells to prepare a highly homologous virus inoculum with each virus (RVRp13, RVRp22, and MLV) at a titer of 1 106 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per ml. the pigs were then observed daily for clinical signs prior to feeding, up to 28 days postchallenge. a PRRSV-specific antibody (IgG) was detected using a commercially available ELISA kit (PRRS X3 Ab test; IDEXX Laboratories, AG, Berne, Switzerland) the ratio between the net optical density of test samples and the net optical density of positive controls was 0.4, which was considered to be positive for the PRRSV antibody. reverse primer (20 pmol, as a final concentration of 0.8 pmol), 0.2 l of TaqMan probes (25 pmol, as a final concentration of 1 pmol), 0.5 l of RNase inhibitor (40 U/l; RiboLock, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Germany) qRT-PCR conditions were in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. titers of each virus in PAMs and MARC-145 cells were compared to see whether the cell preference of each virus changed during the passages in pigs. genetic stability was evaluated on those rescued viruses in each virus group based on the assessment of the stability or reversion of attenuation-related amino acid residues.

RNA was extracted from ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22 (61), their parental strain, VR2332, and MLV using a commercial kit (Ribo-Spin vRD; GeneAll, Seoul, South Korea) the coding regions of the PRRSV genome were amplified separately into five fragments (Frag-1 to Frag-5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. a nonparametric t test was used to compare the mutation frequencies and residual virus loads in tissues within the three virus groups. the nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using Seqman II and Lasergene MegAlign software. a difference was considered statistically significant at a P of 0.05. the washed cell pellet was resuspended with freezing medium (10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO; Hybri-Max, Sigma-Aldrich], 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA] at a final cell population of approximately 5 107 macrophages per ml. both MARC-145 cells and PAMs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented each virus (RVRp13, RVRp22, and MLV) was purified by three rounds of plaque purification in MARC-145 cells. the plaque-purified viruses were propagated again, and virus titers were measured in MARC-145 cells. pigs were randomly divided into three groups for treatment with each virus. each lobe was scored for lung consolidation in percentages (21) and interstitial pneumonia, respectively, due to PRRSV infection. viremia and residual virus loads quantified in serum and tissues. qRT-PCR was performed in a 25-l reaction mixture containing 5 l of template RNA, 12.5 l of 2 RT-PCR buffer, 0.5 l of each forward and reverse primer (20 pmol, as a final concentration of 0.8 pmol), 0.2 l of each forward and reverse primer (20 pmol, as a final concentration of 0.8 pmol), 0.5 l of RNase inhibitor (40 U/l; RiboLock, Ther the PCR amplification was performed on a model 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) samples with a threshold cycle (CT) of 35 cycles or fewer were considered positive. a standard curve previously made of known virus titers was used to calculate the amount of PRRSV in each sample. the mutation frequency was measured (in the nsp2 and ORF5 regions) for the plaque-cloned virus population in each virus-challenged group. parts of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2, ORF5 and ORF6 were amplified from viral RNA in each virus group using a one-step RT-PCR kit. 66F 1366\u20131383 CTCTTGTGCGACTGCTAC 1a2115R 2097\u20132115 TACAGGTCTTTGCTG 1a2058F 2058\u20132075 CCCAGAACAAAACCAACC 1a2867R 2850\u20132867 ATTGCGGTGTGTGTGCTG 1a2771F 2771\u20132788 TGGGAAGAGGACACAA 1a2771F 2771\u20132788 TGGGAAGATTTGTGTGTGTG TTAGGGCAGTCAGG 1b8166F 8166\u20138185 GCAGAATACAAGGTTTGGAG 1b8954R 8937\u20138954 TCAGCACAGGCAAGTTCA 1b8809F 8809\u20138826 GCCCTCGGAAAGAACAAG Frag-4 p*1b9304F 9304\u20139322 GACCCAAAGAAGACAGCAA 2842 p*1b12145R 12127\u201312145 AGAACTCCGT 13716\u201313734 CCTGAGACCATGAGGTGGG p6F 14320\u201314339 AGAGTTGTGCTTGATGTGGG p6R 14983\u201315000 TCTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG r 14457\u201314479 TTTAGGGCATCATCATCATCATCACTGG ORF6 p6F 14320\u201314339 AGAGTTGTGCTTGATGGTTC p6R 14983\u201315000. b Sequences of primers. the subscript prefix p indicates a primer used only for PCR amplification. the remaining primers were used for sequencing. cDNA synthesis and predenaturation at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 94\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of PCR amplification at 94\u00b0C for 15 s (denaturation), 55 to 60\u00b0C for 30 s (annealing), and 68\u00b0C for 1 min/kb (extension) nucleotide sequences of the coding regions in the PRRSV genome were aligned as a consensus sequence. the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions in a full-length genome for the two ribavirin-resistant mutant viruses were deposited in the NCBI database. RESULTS Serum viremia. RVRp13-challenged pigs at P1 had virus titers of 102.04 TCID50/ml at 7 dpc, which gradually declined to 101.12 TCID50/ml at 28 dpc titers ranged from 100.83 to 101.27 TCID50/ml detected between 7 and 21 dpc. viremia results indicated that the virulence of RVRp22 was significantly attenuated in pigs. serum viremia was measured using qRT-PCR (TaqMan chemistry) level of viremia was calculated and is expressed as TCID50/ml equivalents based on the standard curve of the cycle threshold (CT) number plotted against the known virus titer of VR2332. ELISA was performed according to manufacturer's guidelines. pigs at P1 had virus titers of 101.04, 102.08, and 101.91 TCID50/ml in the lungs, bronchial lymph nodes, and tonsils. different tissues were collected from pigs in each virus-challenged group. different tissues (lungs, bronchial lymph nodes, and tonsils) were collected from pigs in each virus-challenged group during the necropsy time at the end of each passage. the residual virus loads were then measured, and virus titers in different tissues were expressed as virus titer in TCID50/ml equivalents. ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, showed poor replication efficiency in PAMs, as did MLV. in vitro growth characteristics of each challenged virus were evaluated in PAMs and MARC-145 cells. each challenged virus was inoculated into PAMs and MARC-145 cells. b PM difference, difference in virus titers between results for PAMs and MARC-145 cells. rescued viruses from the RVRp22-challenged group at P1, P2, and P3 were replicated in PAMs, with mean virus titers of 102.75, 102.87, and 103.12 TCID50/ml respectively. enged groups at P1 replicated in PAM cells with mean virus titers of 104.25 and 102.75 TCID50/ml. between P2 and P3, viruses rescued from the RVRp13- and MLV-challenged groups were able to replicate equally well in both PAMs and MARC-145 cells. the population of the RVRp13-challenged group had a higher mutation frequency than the MLV-challenged group in the ORF5 region. however, the RVRp22-challenged group exhibited a rate of mutation similar to that of the MLV-challenged group in the same region and lower than that of the RVRp13-challenged group. the numbers of nucleotide and amino acid mutations were measured by sequencing 30 plaque-purified virus clones in each virus group at the end of each passage. the mutation frequency was expressed as an average value between passages (P1 to P3) in each group. the reversion of attenuation-related amino acid residues in the PRRSV genome was assessed during replication in pig-to-pig passages. in the RVRp13 and MLV viruses, all amino acid residues postulated to be encoded by attenuation-related genetic markers in their genomes reverted to wild type. the two ribavirin-resistant mutant viruses (RVRp13 and RVRp22) acquired synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations throughout the coding regions in their full-length genomes. 23 were nonsynonymous, namely, 2 mutations in nsp1, 8 mutations in nsp2, 1 mutation each in nsp5, nsp7, nsp10, and nsp11. onymous mutations, a total of 14 were also found in the MLV genome. 5 amino acid changes encoded in ORF1a (331F), ORF1b (946H), ORF2 (10F), ORF5 (151G) and ORF6 (16E) were potentially associated with attenuation-related genetic determinants in the PRRSV genome.

DISCUSSION In this study, two ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22 (61), were evaluated in terms of their genetic and phenotypic stability during replication in pig-to-pig passages. sequences in the RVRp13 and MLV genomes quickly reverted to wild-type sequences during replication in pigs. however, two sequences in the RVRp22 genome, located in ORF2 (10F) and ORF6 (16E), were stable even after the third passage in pigs. this suggests that RVRp22 has higher genetic and phenotypic stability than MLV and RVRp13 during replication in pigs. the viruses rescued from the RVRp13 and MLV groups replicated equally well in PAM and MARC-145 cells as did wild-type PRRSV (84) after the second and third passages, the recovered viruses replicated better in MARC-145 cells than in PAMs. this result coincides with the reversion of the attenuation sequences to virulence and the increased virulence of RVRp13 or MLV in pigs. the nsp2 locus is the most variable region among nonstructural proteins encoded in the PRRSV genome. it consists of four functional regions (17, 72, 73): a papain-like protease domain (PLP2) (20) near the N terminus; a central hypervariable (HV) region with strain-specific insertions or deletions in both type 1 and type 2 PRRSV (86, 87); a putative transmembrane ( nsp7 is a highly conserved protein that has critical roles in PRRSV RNA synthesis and translation (97, 98) and assembly of the replicase protein (99) two additional mutations were found in ORF2 and ORF6, which encode two structural proteins. one mutation (204N) is located in ORF2, which encodes the GP2a/2b protein in the PRRSV genome."}
