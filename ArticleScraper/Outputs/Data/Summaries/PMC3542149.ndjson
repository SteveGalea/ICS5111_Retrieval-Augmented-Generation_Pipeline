{"summary": "pneumonia is one of the most important causes of death in adults and children. pneumonia causes more fatalities than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. at the age of three years, up to 80% of children have suffered at least one episode of acute otitis media. more than 40% have experienced more than six recurrences by the age of seven. the focus of this review is to describe current knowledge on microbial interactions between commonly detected bacterial and viral pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. we will conclude by incorporating the presented information into a single theoretical model of interplay between viral and bacterial species. acute respiratory infections, in particular pneumonia, remain one of the most important causes of death in both adults and children. bacteria first need to colonize the nasopharyngeal niche to cause respiratory disease. imbalances in the ecosystem can contribute to acquisition of a new bacterial or viral pathogen, carriage of multiple potential pathogenic bacteria, or a viral co-infection. a microbe should be able to survive local clearance mechanisms (i.e., mucus, ciliae), attach to the epithelium, rely on locally available nutrients, and bypass surveillance by the host immune system. negative associations may be due to direct interspecies interactions (via ammensalism or predation), or when host immune responses disproportionally affect one of the competing microorganisms. the authors reported an increase in H. influenzae density when S. pneumoniae was present, suggesting synergism between these bacterial species. however, when these two species were inoculated in reverse order, inhibition was observed, indicating competition between both species. there is currently considerable interest in possible interactions between commensals and potential pathogenic microbes. production of substances by one species, for example hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), may eliminate its competitor. the immune system may also be involved in competition, as one bacterium has fewer escape mechanisms to evade the immune system than another. another form of competition involves competition for the same host receptor. in vitro experiments with pneumococcus strains that do not produce H2O2 showed no impact on survival of other species. phenotypic differences could be responsible for discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results. another strategy used by competing species to interfere with each other is targeting structures that mediate adherence to the epithelium of the competing microorganism. this is supported by a large epidemiological study that reported a significant negative association between S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in HIV-uninfected, but not HIV-infected children [34]. a possible failure of the adaptive immune system, mainly CD4 T-cell-mediated [35] and decreased mucosal immunity [34], may contribute to the absence of a negative association between S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in immunocompromised HIV-infected hosts. microbial interactions are multifactorial and involve a complex interplay between multiple host factors and bacterial characteristics. these interactions may have important consequences for the composition and stability of the microbial community itself and susceptibility to disease. one well-studied mechanism used by bacteria to compete with other species is the production of hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2), which is lethal for most bacteria. in vivo experiments with pneumococcal strains that do not produce H2O2 showed no impact on the survival of other species. pre-exposure to one of the two species induces the production of antibodies against phosphorylcholine, thereby promoting clearance of the other co-colonizing species [30], [31] host immune system is also involved in interspecies competition, as has been elegantly shown in vivo by Lysenko et al. [32] m. catarrhalis is able to release outer membrane vesicles containing ubiquitous surface proteins. these proteins are able to deactivate complement factor C3, which is a crucial amplifier of the complement system. this protects H. influenzae from complement-mediated killing. us, whereas 100% of mice infected with both pathogens succumbed to infection within one day [39]. other interactions between viral and bacterial species have been described in the literature. us + NA Mice [63], [64] NA Parainfluenza virus S. pneumoniae + NA Bronchial [48] Small airway [48] Alveolar basal [48] Alveolar basal [53] H. influenzae + Otitis-prone [68] Chinchilla [65] NA M. catarrhalis + Healthy [68] NA Coronavirus H. influenzae + NA Rats [66] NA Virus (column one) and respective bacter viral neuraminidase (NA) activity is able to cleave sialic acids residues. viruses may induce bacterial colonization and replication both directly and indirectly. viruses may also induce changes in immune function favorable to bacterial invasion. viral predisposition to bacterial attachment occurs in case of a simultaneous infection. it has been postulated that viral presence may render the epithelium more susceptible to bacterial colonization. the binding capacities of bacteria to fibronectin appear to be strongly influenced by the amount of exposed fibronectin and exposure duration. rhinovirus-induced paracellular migration of H. influenzae [75] also causes damage to ciliated cells, resulting in decreased mucociliar velocity and impaired bacterial clearance. several bacterial species are able to adhere to a diverse group of adhesion proteins on the surface of host cells [28], [40], [41], [48], [77]. Moreover, some strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae express the natural PAFr-ligand phosphorylcholine, which also allows them to attach to, and invade host cells. adherence of bacteria to RSV-infected cells is thought to be directly mediated by expression of RSV-protein G [46], [47], [51] blockade of G-protein activity does not completely reduce excess bacterial colonization in RSV-infected cells in vitro [51] a co-infection model with influenza virus and S. pneumoniae showed increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia in mice. this is illustrated by data obtained from a co-infection model with influenza virus and S. pneumoniae in mice. a preceding bacterial infection may also increase susceptibility to a consecutive viral infection. viral predisposition to bacterial attachment occurs in case of a simultaneous infection. infection alters the defense of the host epithelium in general. adenoviruses generally replicate intracellularly and can kill infected cells. viral presence may directly induce upregulation of fibronectin expression, as has been shown for rhinovirus-induced paracellular migration of H. influenzae [75] Viruses may also induce damage to ciliated cells, resulting in decreased mucociliar velocity and impaired bacterial clearance [65], [65] some strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae express the natural PAFr-ligand phosphorylcholine, which also allows them to attach to, and invade host cells. in vitro studies have found that influenza virus did not alter the expression of several receptors, including ICAM-, CAECAM, and PAFr. adherence of bacteria to RSV-infected cells is thought to be directly mediated by expression of RSV-protein G [46], [47], [51] this implies that other mechanisms might be involved during viral\u2013bacterial co-occurrence, such as upregulation of additional receptors like ICAM-1 and PAFr [48], [51] or other indirect pathways. viral infection may also lead to increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. this is illustrated by data obtained from a co-infection model with influenza virus and S. pneumoniae in mice. a preceding bacterial infection may also increase susceptibility to a consecutive viral infection. up to 68% of respiratory samples from asymptomatic individuals were positive for respiratory viruses. studies have reported presence rates of 16%\u201333% in developed communities. children in some native populations, such as australians and Alaska Yup'ik Eskimos, are known to be more susceptible to diseases caused by respiratory pathogens. 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 97 2\u20136 y Healthy 14 (15%) 1 (1%) 0 (0%) 2 (2%) 1 (1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 97 2\u20136 y At risk 103 (24%) 37 (8.5%) 2 (0.5%) 3 (1.8%)

accidental or season-related event, or whether the presence of virus A predisposes to the acquisition of virus B. study sizes have been too small to determine whether viral co-occurrence in asymptomatic children is an accidental or season-related event. the median viral load of rhinovirus was significantly lower in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children. viral presence was associated with significantly higher neutrophil counts, but not macrophage, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts. this may imply that a low viral load only triggers a minor inflammatory response without causing respiratory symptoms. several cohort studies of asymptomatic children have found a positive correlation between the presence of adenovirus and rhinovirus and both M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. however, due to the cross-sectional design of most of these studies, it remains unclear whether this reflects a true cause-effect relationship. this model represents the cumulative dynamics of bacterial and viral interactions occurring within the nasopharyngeal niche during asymptomatic episodes. red lines represent a negative association of co-colonization (competition), blue lines represent a positive association of co-colonization (synergism) isencies between in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as between different study populations, underline the involvement of additional factors such as host immunity, genetic background, the commensal environment, available nutrients, and environmental circumstances. new and more detailed knowledge regarding this complex interplay may help us to reconsider how we define the causative mechanisms of respiratory diseases. the four most important bacterial pathogens of respiratory tract infections known to interact with other microorganisms and viruses. we combined these terms with the following search terms for the four bacteria of interest individually and combined. we performed a global search for mechanisms by which interactions may occur. we combined different search terms to create a complete overview. for studies on the asymptomatic presence of viruses, we performed a search with the viral search terms described above. bacterial interactions were defined by the following criteria. we combined these terms with the search terms for the four bacteria of interest individually and combined. we have considered all relevant studies in the present review. however, when extensive literature was available, we decided to refer to a limited number of representative papers based on relevance, study size, and study design."}
