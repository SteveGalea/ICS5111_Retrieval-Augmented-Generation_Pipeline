{"summary": "the Coronavirus Study Group of the international committee for taxonomy of Viruses has replaced the traditional groups 1, 2, and 3 CoVs with three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, discovery of SARS-CoV, and identification of SARS-CoV-like viruses from wild live markets in china boosted interest in the discovery of novel CoVs in humans and animals [11, in 2012, a novel CoV, named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a cause of severe respiratory infections associated with high mortalities [37,38,39,40] dromedaries in the middle east possessed neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. Isolation of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 Of the seven cell lines inoculated with dromedary fecal samples positive for DcCoV UAE-HKU23, viral replication was detected by RT-PCR in the supernatants of HRT-18G. viral loads of 2.6 1010 and 9.7 106 copies/mL in HRT-18G cells in the presence of trypsin were also observed in infected HRT-18G cells five days after in dromedary camel coronavirus (DcCoV) UAE-HKU23 infected HRT-18G cells using serum from dromedary showing apple green fluorescence. at least seven distinct RNA species were identified, with the sizes corresponding to predicted subgenomic mRNAs. the subgenomic mRNA sequences are shown in alignment with the leader and the genomic sequences. the leader and subgenomic mRNA of NS2, HE, S, and N exactly matched each other, whereas there was one base mismatch for NS5 and M. dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 antibody detection by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody tests. dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 antibody detection by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody assay. the highest dilutions of the serum, obtained from the mouse immunized with the MERS-CoV N protein, were 1:512,000 and 1:8000. the highest dilutions of the serum, obtained from the mouse immunized with the MERS-CoV N protein, were 1:512,000 and 1:8000. neutralization antibody titer of pooled serum sample was 1:160 for DcCoV UAE-HKU23 but 1:20 for MERS-CoV. complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), S, and N genes of 11 additional DcCoV UAE-HKU23 strains were sequenced. the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 50 nucleotides. for S, the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 100 nucleotides. bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees and those below 70% are not shown. each point plotted is the percent genetic distance within a sliding window of 200 nt wide, centered on the position plotted. each curve represents a comparison of the sequence data of alpaca CoV to the reference sequence data of alpaca CoV. Isolation of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 Of the seven cell lines inoculated with dromedary fecal samples positive for DcCoV UAE-HKU23, viral replication was detected by RT-PCR in the supernatants of HRT-18G. viral loads of 2.6 1010 and 9.7 106 copies/mL in HRT-18G cells in the presence of trypsin were also observed in infected HRT-18G cells five days after in uninfected and (d) infected HRT-18G cells using serum from dromedary showed apple green fluorescence in (arrows). at least seven distinct RNA species were identified, with the sizes corresponding to predicted subgenomic mRNAs of NS2 (9600 bp), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) (8760 bp), spike (S) (7460 bp), NS5 (3040 bp), envelope (E the subgenomic mRNA sequences are shown in alignment with the leader and the genomic sequences. the leader and subgenomic mRNA of NS2, HE, S, and N exactly matched each other, whereas there was one base mismatch for NS5 and M. dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 antibody detection by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody tests. there was significant correlation between the titers determined by the immunofluorescence antibody test and the neutralization antibody assay (Pearson coefficient = 0.525, p 0.0001) coV UAE-HKU23 N protein generated immunoreactive bands in the western blot assay. highest dilutions of serum obtained from mouse immunized with the MERS-CoV N protein were 1:512,000 and 1:8000. serum obtained was tested for neutralization antibodies. complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), S, and N genes of 11 additional DcCoV UAE-HKU23 strains from dromedary fecal samples were sequenced. phylogenetic analysis using either nucleotide or amino acid sequences revealed two clusters. there were 10 nucleotide differences between the two groups. the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 50 nucleotides. for S, the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 100 nucleotides. bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees and those below 70% are not shown. each point plotted is the percent genetic distance within a sliding window of 200 nt wide, centered on the position plotted. each curve represents a comparison of the sequence data of alpaca CoV to the reference sequence data of alpaca CoV. we have successfully isolated DcCoV UAE-HKU23 using the HRT-18G cell line. HCoVs OC43 and 229E induce only subtle CPEs, even if isolated. the HRT-18G cell line could be used to isolate other members of Betacoronavirus lineage A for further characterization of these CoVs. the alpaca CoV and DcCoV UAE-HKU23 are both members of Betacoronavirus 1. the S protein of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 contains one additional potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid position 492 compared to alpaca CoV. this potential N-glycosylation site is also present in the S proteins of canine respiratory coronavirus and HCoV-OC43. this potential N-glycosylation site is also present in the S proteins of canine respiratory coronavirus and HCoV-OC43, but not in those of other antibody titer of serum obtained from mouse immunized with recombinant N protein of MERS-CoV for anti-N of MERS-CoV was 64 folds higher than that for anti-N of MERS-CoV. dromedaries are the natural reservoirs of both DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV. coV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV showed a high seroprevalence in dromedaries as determined by immunofluorescence antibody tests and neutralization antibody assays. the relatively lower seropositivity as determined by Western blot is because only prominent immunoreactive bands were considered unambiguously positive in Western blot analysis. qRT-PCR was performed using a real-time one-step qRT-PCR. we prepared a series of six log10 dilutions equivalent to 101\u2013106 copies per reaction mixture. the blot was prehybridized with ULTRAhyb-Oligo Hybridization buffer (Ambion, USA) and probed with a nucleocapsid-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probe 5\u2032-CCAGAACGATTTCCAGAGCTCTACT-3\u2032. the blot was hybridized at 42 \u00b0C overnight and washed with low- and high-stringency buffers as recommended by the manufacturer the mixtures were amplified in 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. RT-PCR products corresponding to each subgenomic mRNA could be distinguished by size differences on agarose gel electrophoresis. immunofluorescence antibody Tests HRT-18G cells infected with DcCoV UAE-HKU23 were fixed in chilled acetone at 20 \u00b0C for 10 min. cells were incubated with four-fold dilutions of serum from 1:10 to 1:10,240 from 59 dromedaries. the sequences encoding amino acids 1\u2013449 and 1\u2013414 of the N proteins of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV respectively were amplified and cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of expression vector pET-28b(+) and NdeI and NotI sites of expression vector pETH respectively. the recombinant N proteins of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV analysis Western blot analysis was performed according to our published protocol [15] with 1.5 g purified (His)6-tagged recombinant N proteins of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV. antigen-antibody interaction was detected with 1:4000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA) RNA was eluted in 60 L of AVE buffer (QIAGEN) and was used as the template for RT-PCR. the complete RdRp, S, and N genes of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 strains from 11 additional dromedaries were amplified. RSCU values were calculated for the 59 relevant codons (excluding methionine, tryptophan, and stop codons) by SSE [70]. CA was performed on the RSCU values using the R statistical software, version 2.15.1 [71] and the function \u201ccorresp\u201d from the modern Applied Statistics with S (MASS) library. cells were maintained in serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with or without supplementation by tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (1 g/mL) all infected cell lines were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for seven days. the blot was prehybridized with ULTRAhyb-Oligo Hybridization buffer (Ambion, USA) and probed with a nucleocapsid-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probe 5\u2032-CCAGAACGATTTCCAGAGACGCTCTACT-3\u2032. the blot was hybridized at 42 \u00b0C overnight and washed with low- and high-stringency buffers as recommended by the manufacturer cDNA was PCR amplified with a forward primer located in the leader sequence and a reverse primer located in the body of each mRNA (Table 2). the PCR mixture (25 L) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin), and 200 M of each dNTPs.
