{"summary": "avian influenza virus subtypes have been found to directly infect humans from their avian hosts. recent emergence, host expansion, and spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Asia have heightened concerns globally. this paper will review the current human infections with avian influenza. the HA glycoprotein mediates attachment and entry of the virus by binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface. human virus subtypes prefer to bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by -2,6 linkages found in human respiratory epithelium [8,9] NA subtypes 9 Predominant human subtypes H1, H2, H3 Avian subtypes H1\u2013H16 HPAI subtypes H5 and H7 Conversion to HPAI Basic amino acid insertion in HA Avian sialic acid-galactose linkages -2,6 linkages. the virus is then spread in secretions or other bodily fluids. human cases of HPAI H5N1 followed the poultry outbreak, with a total of 256 cases and 151 fatalities thus far. however, HPAI H5N1 remains the largest and most significant poultry and human avian influenza outbreak. influenza is transmitted through the fecal-oral and respiratory routes among wild birds and poultry. human interaction with these secretions and birds was the major mode of transmission, with contact including consumption of undercooked or raw poultry products. in each of these cases, no personal protective equipment was used. clinical manifestations of avian influenza in humans ranged from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure. median age of patients was 17.2 years in the 1997 HPAI H5N1 outbreak and 16 years in the 2003 to 2006 Southeast Asian cases. clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of avian influenza in humans Clinical presentation Conjunctivitis Influenza-like illness Nausea Emesis Diarrhea Shortness of breath Pneumonia Laboratory findings Lymphopenia Thrombocytopenia Elevated creatinine Abnormal transaminases Chest radiographic findings. clinical diagnosis of avian influenza in humans is difficult and relies on the epidemiological link to endemic areas, contact with sick or dead poultry, or contact with a confirmed case of avian influenza. the clinician should always elicit a detailed patient history. the definitive diagnosis is made from isolation of the virus in culture from clinical specimens. adamantanes have no role due to widespread resistance through a protein alteration. over 90% of isolates of H1 and H3 human subtypes during seasonal influenza have had resistance to the adamantanes. adamantanes have no role due to widespread resistance through a M2 protein alteration. resistance to oseltamivir has been documented in a HPAI H5N1 subtype in a Vietnamese girl treated with 75 mg daily for 4 days as post-exposure prophylaxis [68,88] resistance produced by this change may be overcome with higher doses of oseltamivir in vitro. the window of optimal therapy is still unknown, particularly if viral shedding exceeds the average 48 to 72 hour period seen in seasonal influenza A and B infections. ribaviron by inhalation has been evaluated in vitro with some avian influenza A subtypes. a large randomized trial looked at an H5N1 attenuated vaccine from the Vietnam strain. only a modest immune response was seen, with micro-neutralization antibodies being developed at 12 times the dose used in the seasonal influenza vaccine. a number of other industry trials with adjuvant vaccines are currently ongoing. avian influenza viruses have occurred with increased incidence within the human population, reflecting the delicate and tangled interaction between wildlife, domesticated animals, and humans. thematic series on disaster management edited by J Christopher Farmer."}
