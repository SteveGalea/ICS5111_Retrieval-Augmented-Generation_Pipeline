{"summary": "118 cases and 98 controls were analyzed; 44.1% were female. 118 cases and 98 controls were analyzed; 44.1% were female. pneumonia in children was mainly attributed to S. pneumoniae, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A virus. increased pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage in children could significantly reduce the burden of pneumonia in sub-Saharan africa countries. a prospective multicenter case-control study was implemented in the pediatric department of Gabriel Tour\u00e9 University Hospital at Bamako, Mali, between July 2011 and December 2012. the multicenter study is ongoing, it will include ten study sites located in 9 countries over 3 continents. controls were patients hospitalized for surgery or in a routine outpatient practice environment, aged between 2 and 59 months, without any symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness. cases and controls were matched for age (1 year) and calendar date of hospital admission (1 month) to take seasonality into account. influenza A, influenza A(H1/N1), influenza B, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus HKU1, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, human metapneumoviruses A and B, rhinovirus, RSVs A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae PAF allows the estimation of the proportional reduction in pneumonia occurrence that would occur if the pathogen was absent (alternative ideal scenario) no patient was excluded because of missing data. 50,000 consultations and 10,000 hospital admissions occur in the pediatrics department annually. acute respiratory infections represent 34% of admissions in children. acute respiratory infections represent 34% of admissions in children. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials were collected from cases only. whole blood and pleural effusions (in applicable cases) were collected from cases for broad spectrum antibiotic detection. Statistical analysis Demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, medical history, clinical examination at enrollment, radiological findings, vaccinations, and outcome were recorded prospectively for each patient on a standardized form. continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range (IQR), categorical variables as number and percentage. study protocol, informed consent statement, clinical research form, any amendments and all other study documents were submitted to and approved by the institutional ethics committee. results Overall Population Among the 119 enrolled cases, 118 conformed with the inclusion criteria and were all sampled. one patient without radiological confirmation was excluded from the analysis. circumference, cm, median (IQR) 13 (12\u201314) 12.5 (11\u201314) 0.01 Weight-for-height Z-score 2 SD 52 (44.1) 41 (44.1) 0.99 Weight-for-height Z-score 3 SD 32 (27.1) 22 (23.7) 0.57 Medical history Heart disease 4 (3.4) 0 (0) 0.001 Contracted a common cold/pharyngitis b 61 (31.7) 0 (0) 0.001 Contracted a four (3.9%) pneumonia cases presented a ventricular septal defect. none had previous tuberculosis or underlying lung disease. 17 (14.4%) received amoxicillin, 8 (5.6%) Ceftriaxone, 4 (2.8%) Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, and 3 (2.1%) Cotrimoxazole. sensitivity of declared antibiotic use compared with urine detection was low. fifty-one (43.2%) received oxygen for a median length of 2 days. death was directly related to pneumonia in 4 patients. a by PCR b Blood culture Comparison of Characteristics of Pneumonia Cases and Controls Table 1 compares the clinical signs and symptoms at admission between cases and controls. Pneumonia cases were more frequently hypoxemic at admission than the controls (30.5% vs. 0%, P0.001). a dose-response relationship was apparent between the number of microorganisms found in nasal swabs and the risk of being a case. distribution of S. pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S. pneumoniae in January-June and of RSV in July-September. children pneumonia cases and controls, nasal swabs, Mali, N = 216. microbiological findings of children pneumonia cases and controls. the most prevalent serotype in pneumonia cases and controls was serotype 6A/B (18.6% vs. 11.2%, P = 0.13) serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls: 6.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.009, and 4.2% vs. 0%, P = 0.04, respectively. influenza in 5 (4.2%) patients by PCR blood sample detection. most patients with S. pneumoniae detection had also S. pneumoniae nasal carriage (93.5%, 15/16), while only 17.6% (15/85) of patients with S. pneumoniae nasal carriage had positive detection by PCR (P = 0.04) median length of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR: 6\u201310 days) for a total of 909 days of hospitalization. the median time period between first symptoms and hospitalization was 6 days (IQR: 4\u20137 days) 0 (0) 0.37 Vital signs at admission Temperature, \u00b0C, median (IQR) 38.6 (37.8\u201339.4) 37 (36.8\u201337.4) 0.001 Breathing rate, cycles/min, median (IQR) 56 (48\u201367) 31 (29\u201335) 0.001 Cardiac rate, cycles/min, median (IQR) 151 (132\u2013167) 122 (112\u2013132) 0.001 Oxygen saturation, % four (3.9%) pneumonia cases presented a ventricular septal defect. none had previous tuberculosis or underlying lung disease. other signs or medical history of pneumonia cases included sickle-cell anaemia.
