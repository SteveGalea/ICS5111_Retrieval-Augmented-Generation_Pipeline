{"summary": "domain 1 of NS5A is essential for the formation of DMVs. deletion mutations were introduced into a subgenomic luciferase reporter replicon. deletion of a segment of domain 2 (D2short) or all of domain 3 (D3) was tolerated. cells were harvested 4, 24, 48, and 72 h post electroporation. values were normalized to the 4-h value, reflecting transfection efficiency. a replication-deficient mutant encoding an inactive NS5B polymerase served as a negative control. expression and cleavage of the polyprotein in transfected cells were determined by Western blotting with different NS5A-monospecific antibodies. the polyproteins were properly processed, with the exception of D1, where we observed two proteins that were identified as NS5A and an uncleaved NS4B-5A precursor. the abundance of NS5A and NS4B was comparable to that in other mutants. deletions within NS5A and their impact on the formation of DMVs. cells were transfected with the expression constructs shown to the left of the panels. cells were fixed and processed for EM by cryofixation and epon embedding. these DMVs were confined in smaller clusters, in contrast to the more interspersed distribution of wild-type-induced DMVs. for the pTM construct, 15 cell profiles from two independent experiments (10 and 5 respectively) were counted to calculate the DMVs per square micrometer. omic replicons, only 5 cell profiles from one experiment were counted. luciferase activity measured 48 h and 4 h after transfection to normalize for transfection efficiency. in cells containing large amounts of DMVs, mitochondria were frequently found at the periphery of DMV-containing areas, whereas LDs were found either within these areas or surrounding them. the intrinsically disordered regions of NS5A (LCSI up to D3) are dispensable for DMV induction yet required for RNA replication (D2) or virus assembly (D3) (20), respectively. thus, the defect of mutant D2long in RNA replication is not linked to a lack of nification electron micrograph and fluorescence image of cell boxed in panel C. a set of previously described mutations within these regions disturb features of the AH, abrogate zinc binding of subdomain 1a, or disturb disulfide bond of subdomain 1b. in the AH, which is required for HCV RNA replication (17), two mutations reported earlier (28) were inserted into the JFH-1 isolate (genotype 2a) steady-state levels of these variant NS5A proteins were comparable to those of the wild type (Fig. 4C; Table 1). Thus, specific residues within the NS5A N-terminal AH are required for the biogenesis of DMVs. NS5A contains a zinc-binding motif in the N-terminal part of D1 (designated subdomain D1a) that is absolutely required for NS5A structure integrity (29) a C59G mutation affecting the cysteine residue coordinating Zn2+ binding inhibited HCV RNA replication (18) and abrogated the formation of DMVs. NS3-5B polyprotein expression construct lacking the helicase domain. mutant was unable to induce DMVs. expression of NS3-4A in cis is required for efficient formation of DMVs. western blot analysis revealed proper polyprotein cleavage by wild-type NS3-4A. only uncleaved precursor and presumably degradation products were found in cells containing the proteolytically inactive NS3-4A protein. vesicles composed of two or more lipid bilayers were detected in cells containing the active NS3-4A protein. a total of 90 and 30 DMVs and 10 and 5 cell profiles were analyzed for NS3-5B- and NS4B-5B+ NS3-4A expressing cells. mutations altering cleavage kinetics at the NS4B-5A site are detrimental for HCV RNA replication. NS5A-containing proteins were isolated by NS5A-specific immunoprecipitation and analyzed by autoradiography. NS5A-containing proteins were isolated by NS5A-specific immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. luciferase reporter replicons containing cleavage site mutations. the wild type and the NS5B polymerase-dead mutant (GDD) served as positive and negative controls. the wild type and the NS5B polymerase-dead mutant served as positive and negative controls. luciferase reporter replicon containing the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus is shown on the top. values were normalized to the 4-h values, reflecting transfection efficiency. a fraction of the cells was fixed and analyzed by EM. transfection of replicon RNAs by electroporation described elsewhere. pTM vectors allowing expression of JFH-1-derived polyprotein fragments were transfected with the Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection Reagent. luciferase activity contained in cell lysates was determined at different time points after electroporation."}
