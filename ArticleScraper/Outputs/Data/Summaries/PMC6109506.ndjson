{"summary": "wild birds are widely acknowledged to be reservoirs and transmitters of pathogens responsible for emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARSV), avian influenza virus A (H10N7) and west Nile virus (WNV), to domestic animals and humans. identifying and monitoring the transmission of novel viruses is one of the vital requisites for responding to outbreaks. sequencing technique provides limited sequence information at a higher cost per nucleotide base and can only be used to identify pathogens with a high titer. a preliminary evidence of the presence of certain viruses is required for performing the PCR. this method was initially developed for studying bacterial communities (e.g., studies on gut microbiota), but today it is widely employed for various tasks. metagenomics still allows the detection of different viral pathogens using shotgun sequencing. despite the constant reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing, this approach is still considerably expensive and not feasible for screening a large number of samples. the effectiveness of the study could be significantly increased by combining genus-specific PCR and NGS. in this approach, the products of different PCR assays for each sample would be pooled in one tube, purified, eluted in a minimal volume, and prepared for NGS [17] source was used to retrieve sequences of polymerase genes of target viral genera. sequences were filtered by length (400 bp), quality, and intrageneric similarity. original FASTA file was iteratively clustered using CD-HIT. two subsequences were considered to be a pair if they together covered at least 90% of species related to a target genus or cluster. the pairs were then filtered according to their annealing temperature (50\u00b0C Ta 55\u00b0C) the selected primer pairs were then aligned with the NR database using BLAST to check for their specificity. avirus Lassa virus LASV 5 Rhabdoviridae Lyssavirus Rabies virus RABV 6 Ledantevirus N/A 7 Coronaviridae Alphacoronavirus N/A 8 Betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV 9 Gammacoronavirus N/A 10 Reoviridae Orbivirus Kemerovo virus KEMV 11 Orthoreovirus N/A 12 Seadornavirus N/A mammarena_r WGATTTRAACTCTGCAACAAAYCTR 5 lyssa_r TATGTCGGRCAYARAACCTGRT 6 ledante_f AAYAATACATGGCC ledante_r ARTATTCTCTMARMKCCCARGACAT 7 alphacorona_f GGYACHACHTCWGGTGATGS alphacorona_r GYTTACGYARRTAACCAWAAWABTC 8 betacorona_ cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription reaction performed on 5 L of the extracted RNA using the Reverta-L RT kit (AmpliSens; total volume of.
