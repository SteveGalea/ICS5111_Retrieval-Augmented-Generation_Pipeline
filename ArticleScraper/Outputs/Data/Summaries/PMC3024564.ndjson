{"summary": "in the past several years, great achievement has been made in the treatment/management of cardiovascular diseases. a large amount of information has been generated, which has allowed the development of many effective treatment strategies. small animal models are more applicable to research work compared to large animal models due to their inexpensiveness and convenience in handling. animal models of MI MI can be achieved by two methods. the first is to fully block or partially narrow the coronary artery. this can be achieved by a surgical procedure or by drug intervention. the other method is to induce atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. this approach is rarely adopted in research studies, since it is time-consuming. the difficulty in operating on small rodents, particularly mice, due to the size of the wound created has to be addressed. the coronary ligation procedure often gives rise to apical aneurysmatic infarcts of variable size. Cohen et al. developed this occlusion model in small animals by encircling a superficial branch of the rabbit left coronary artery. the occluder is connected to a vacuum pump or compressed air to control balloon inflation and coronary occlusion. the use of this model reduces mortality and the size of the surgical wound when compared with LAD ligation-induced MI. clinical trials have also produced some encouraging results. the current experimental evidence suggests that the benefits of stem cell therapy are modest. 1.2. Animal Models of MI MI in animal models can be achieved by two methods. the first is to fully block or partially narrow the coronary artery, which often leads to acute ischemia. this can be achieved by a surgical procedure or by drug intervention. the other method is to induce atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. surgical procedures for cauterization or cryo-injury-induced MI have been previously studied using various animal models. occlusion model was developed from percutanous translaminal coronary angioplasty. occlusion model was applied in large animal models. balloon occluder is connected to a vacuum pump or compressed air to control balloon inflation and coronary occlusion. the procedure is reliable and reproducible, allowing the accurate positioning of the balloon. it is the first choice model to induce post-infarct reperfusion. the surgical procedure can be divided into three steps. the heart of an animal under anaesthesia is exposed following a left thoracotomy at the fourth intercostal space. ligation of the LAD can cause irreversible damage to the myocardium. occlusion model was developed from percutanous translaminal coronary angioplasty. the balloon occluder is connected to a vacuum pump or compressed air to control balloon inflation and coronary occlusion. the procedure is reliable and reproducible. drug-induced ischemia can be easily achieved, since it increases myocardial oxygen consumption or induces coronary artery spasm to reduce blood flow. however, drug safety and the difficulty in accurately positioning the infarct region make this model rarely used in clinical research. induced-pluripotent stem cell [53] have the potential to improve the function of ventricular muscle after MI. current experimental evidence suggests the benefits of stem cell therapy are modest. 1-ECII the anti-1-adrenergic receptor antibody against the second extracellular receptor loop represents a potent \u201cself-antigen\u201d that induces DCM [64, 65]. matsui et al. using a rabbit model were the first to present data on the development of biventricular dilatation. nearly half of rabbits showed increased heart weight and heart weight-to-body weight ratios, biventricular dilation, myocyte hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and myocarditis. LP-BM5 murine AIDS (MAIDS) retrovirus induced DCM in the absence of chronic cardiac inflammation, suggesting MAIDS retroviral infection can lead to DCM without myocarditis [75] DCM is a primary myocardial disease characterized by chamber dilation associated with impaired systolic and diastolic function. it starts from asymptomatic LV dilatation or impaired systolic function, exercise-induced symptoms, and finally to overt congestive heart failure. the onset of DCM can be linked to viral infection, genetic abnormalities, and autoimmune mechanisms. a rabbit model showed an upregulation of total cardiac -AR following immunization with 1-ECII-homologous peptide [66]. intraperitoneal injection of blood lymphocytes from immunized anti- 1-ECII-positive rabbits or from anti-1-AR-positive DCM patients [68] can avoid the expected immune reaction against rabbit or human non-self proteins. LP-BM5 murine AIDS (MAIDS) retrovirus induced DCM in the absence of chronic cardiac inflammation, suggesting MAIDS retroviral infection can lead to DCM without myocarditis [75]. Approximately 20% of patients have a gene mutation [62], which affects the myosin heavy chain [76], cardiac actin [77], tropomyosin [78], or troponin [79], inducing a functional impairment of the referred proteins. ANIMAL MODELS OF HEART FAILURE (HF) 3.1. Introduction HF is associated with 50% survival at 5 years. use of animal models is indispensable in understanding the pathophysiology of HF. s with an infarction size greater than 46% developed CHF after 21 days. the impairment of LV function was closely associated with the extent of myocardial loss. HF seems to be strain-dependent, since Sprague-Dawley and Lewis rats have a mortality rate of 36% and 16%, respectively. a thoracotomy is performed on the chosen animal model; a probe or copper wire is inserted into the epicardium along the LCA. the probe is then removed, resulting in an average reduction in the luminal diameter by 42%. HF may occur as a result of chronic cardiac ischemia. a number of studies showed improvement in cardiac function when bone marrow-derived stem cells were directly implanted. however, limited or no differentiation of bone marrow cells to cardiovascular cell types suggested that the beneficial effect was independent of tissue regeneration [102]. further research is required to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of EPCs in HF. HF is based on intracoronary embolisation with microspheres [91], agarose or polystyrene beads or intracoronary injection of thrombin and autogenous blood with fibrinogen. the embolisation increased the LV end-diastolic pressure, which was accompanied by a significant rise in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. this model mimics the clinical situation of patients with HF and acute coronary syndrome. a thoracotomy is performed on the chosen animal model; a probe or copper wire is inserted into the epicardium along the LCA. the probe is then removed, resulting in an average reduction in the luminal diameter by 42%. eroid constrictor These methods allow complete or partial occlusion of coronary artery branches in animal models. they are applicable to induce HF [86, 87], and coronary stenosis for the investigation of hibernating myocardium. the occluder is then inflated to induce partial stenosis or complete occlusion. the ejection fraction of the LV was less than 35%. in this model coronary artery embolisation increased the LV end-diastolic pressure. three months after the embolisation, patchy myocardial fibrosis was observed. an excessive coronary artery occlusion may induce persisting ST segment elevation even after removal of the probe. the maximal resting coronary blood flow can decrease by 43% 5\u20137 days following the operation. a complete occlusion of the coronary artery can develop. myocarditis is an infection of the heart, with inflammatory infiltrate, causing damage to the heart muscle [106], which may or may not result in the death of heart tissue. the immune-mediated cardiac damage could play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of post-infectious human cardiomyopathies [110]. cTnI and cardiac troponin T are two proteins associated with myocyte contractile apparatus. cTnI is highly sensitive and specific for myocarditis in mice 17 \u2013 21 days after immunization. sensitivity of cTnT measurement is maximal at day 16. induction of EAM by active immunization with Bordetella is known. emulsion of selected immunogen (cardiac myosin or cardiac myosin peptide) is prepared. rat is euthanized 21 days after first immunization. the initial phase often passes without symptoms, since the initial damage is often prevented by the innate immune response. the second phase results from immune dysregulation, triggered by the initial cardiomyocyte injury. the initial cellular and humoral immune responses may improve the outcome during phase 1; conversely, they are responsible for the harmful effect during phase 2. a tail vein injection of ESC significantly increased the survival of viral myocarditis mice. they found that a tail vein injection of ESC significantly increased the survival of viral myocarditis mice. these studies demonstrate the potential stem cell therapy has in treating myocarditis. the immunogen is injected subcutaneously into mouse; 7 days later a second dose of immunogen emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) is administered; 21 days after the first immunization the mouse is euthanized. the heart is immediately removed, fixed in formalin for 24 hours, stained and a histopathological assessment performed to ascertain whether EAM is established. the heart is immediately removed, fixed in formalin for 24 hours. the heart is immediately removed, fixed in formalin for 24 hours. the injection of cardiac myosin and B. pertussis is the only way to induce EAM in rats. the immunogen is injected subcutaneously into mouse; 7 days later a second dose of immunogen emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) is administered. the heart is immediately removed, fixed in formalin for 24 hours, stained and a histopathological assessment performed to ascertain whether EAM is established. cTnI is highly sensitive and specific for myocarditis in mice 17 \u2013 21 days after immunization. the heart is immediately removed, fixed in formalin for 24 hours, stained and a histopathological assessment performed to ascertain whether EAM is established. the injection of cardiac myosin and B. pertussis is the only way to induce EAM in rats. direct virus injection can cause myocarditis in three phases. the initial phase often passes without symptoms. the second phase results from immune dysregulation, triggered by the initial cardiomyocyte injury. weener et al. investigated the effect of delivering spleen-derived EPC into a rat model of inflammatory-mediated myocardial damage. they found that EPC caused a functional improvement in cardiac performance evident by higher fractional shortening, reduced scar tissue and thickened ventricular walls. adenovirus vector was carrying human wild-type caveolin-3 gene. it was able to prevent phenylephrine and endothelin-1-induced hypertrophic responses. there have been a few reports on stem cell therapy following CH."}
