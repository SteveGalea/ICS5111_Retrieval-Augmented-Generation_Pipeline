{"summary": "hantaviruses are enveloped viruses with a segmented RNA genome of negative polarity. hantaviruses belong to the genus Hantavirus within the family Bunyaviridae. hantaviruses are harbored by small mammals, mainly rodents. a large number of shrews and moles (order Soricomorpha/Eulipotyphla) and bats (order Chiroptera) have been identified as reservoirs of additional hantaviruses. the discovery of these highly divergent hantaviruses challenge the previous assumption of a strict virus-host coevolution over long time scales. HCPS suggest that the previously used dichotomy of clinical presentation might not be useful to describe the clinical outcome of human hantavirus infections. in the reservoir host a hantavirus infection is usually believed to be persistent and not associated with (at least obvious) disease. the causal relationship and the relevance of these observations remain, however, unknown. reservoir animal models for in vivo studies are not available for the majority of species that harbor hantaviruses. main reasons are difficulties in breeding and keeping these species under laboratory conditions. many rodents as well as members of the orders Soricomorpha/Eulipotyphla and Chiroptera are protected species. a plethora of novel viruses have been identified in bats, among them many zoonotic viruses. most bat species, similar to rodents and insectivores, are not available for animal experiments. this has stimulated the establishment of novel in vitro models. reservoir-derived cells can be beneficial over conventional cell lines to isolate reservoir-borne viruses. henipa-related paramyxovirus Cedar virus was firstly isolated in primary kidney cells derived from a flying fox (Pteropus alecto), the species which naturally harbors this virus. bank voles was well adapted for reproduction in the reservoir host but not in cell culture. strains propagated on vero E6 replicated to much higher efficiency in cell culture. hantavirus strains evolved during multiple cell culture passages. bat cell lines obtained from Pipistrellus ceylonicus allowed propagation of a rhabdovirus pathogenic to humans. the cells did not support replication of a number of bunya-, alpha- and flaviviruses. reservoir-derived cell lines from bats could provide hints to a wildlife origin of human viruses circulating in the human population. model is highly suitable to investigate the biology of filoviruses in cells derived from their presumed reservoir. it has been shown that the glycoprotein of EBOV can interact in fruit bat and human cells in a similar manner. the glycoprotein of Lloviu virus, a filovirus from bats that has not been isolated so far, mediate cellular entry in similar manner. pathogenic hantaviruses in contrast to non-pathogenic hantaviruses display a different induction of microRNAs in human endothelial cells, macrophages and epithelial cells. innate immunity escape mechanisms are linked to the activity of the putative NSs protein, exclusively identified in arvicoline, sigmodontine- and neotomine-associated hantaviruses. the henipa-related paramyxovirus Cedar virus was firstly isolated in primary kidney cells derived from a flying fox. only primary kidney cells showed a cytopathic effect while several other cell lines, including Vero cells, did not. hantaviruses are not as hard to isolate as other zoonotic viruses. hantavirus strains evolve during multiple cell culture passages. a stop codon in the coding sequence of the NSs open reading frame of TULV may represent adaptation of the virus to the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. bat cell lines obtained from Pipistrellus ceylonicus allowed propagation of a rhabdovirus pathogenic to humans. the cells did not support replication of a number of bunya-, alpha- and flaviviruses. reservoir-derived cell lines from bats could provide hints to a wildlife origin of human viruses already circulating. glycoprotein of EBOV can interact in fruit bat and human cells in a similar manner and does not limit EBOV tropism to certain bat species. surface glycoproteins of african henipaviruses could induce syncytium formation in a cell line derived from an African fruit bat. reservoir-derived cell lines from bats could also provide insights into the reservoir host innate immune response to paramyxoviruses. hantaviruses can infect multiple cell types, but have a tropism to endothelial cells in human infection. hantaviruses can infect multiple cell types, but have a tropism to endothelial cells in human infection. hantaviruses can infect dendritic cells which are suggested to significantly contribute to hantavirus pathogenesis in humans. one of the few reservoir-derived cell lines available from a hantavirus reservoir host is a spontaneously immortalized cell line derived from an adult bank vole. this cell line was permissive to several arthropod- and rodent-borne viruses such as Vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, Sindbis virus, Pixuna virus, Usutu virus, Inkoo virus, and Borna disease virus. primary cell characteristics Primary cells Spontaneously immortalized cells Immortalization None Occurs only after multiple passages Possible at low passage number Genetic background Close to in vivo situation Artificial (severe changes can occur upon immortalization) Proliferative capacity Mostly low * High High Life span Limited, finite Not limited, infinite Biological properties Close to in vivo situation Dedifferentiation depends on immortalization methods Selection of distinct cell types possible, conditional immortalization strategy feasible Selection of distinct cell types possible Standardization a pragmatic approach is to focus on representative species. cell lines derived from these animals could be compared to the in vivo infection in an animal model with the associated virus species. a thorough screening for contaminants from the field is necessary. reservoir-derived cell lines can serve as a valuable in vitro tool. synergistic approaches of bat-, rodent- and insectivore-borne viruses and their reservoirs might enable the identification of general mechanisms of virus persistence. community."}
