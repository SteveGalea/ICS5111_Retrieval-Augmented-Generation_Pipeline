{"summary": "the numbers and percentages of peripheral blood immune cells were measured in 27 patients with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. the functional phenotypes of T cells and monocytes, as well as serum cytokine levels, were analyzed by flow cytometry. in this paper, we describe the cytokine profiles and functional phenotypes of immunocompetent cells in 27 patients. we determined the functional phenotypes of immunocompetent cells and serum cytokine profiles of the participants. n (%) 8 (29.6) Exposure to live poultry, n (%) 16 (59.3) Underlying conditions, n (%) Any 15 (55.6) Hypertension 13 (48.1) Coronary heart disease 2 (7.4) Diabetes mellitus 3 (11.1) Days between disease onset and admission 1.0 (0.5 to 19.0) White blood cell count (109/L) 5.1 3.0 Hemoglobin (g/dl) 123 24 Platelet count (109/L) 132 aAPACHE II, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; PaO2: FiO2: FiO2: ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen. sensitivity of these RT-PCR assays was approximately 100 copies/ml RNA. phycoerythrin (PE) cyanine 5\u2013conjugated (Pcy5) anti-CD3, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD4, PE-conjugated anti-CD8. whole-blood samples stained with antibodies against FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD38 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA individual serum samples were obtained from patients immediately after hospitalization. concentrations of serum interferon (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), TNF-, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12P70 were determined using a cytometric bead array. patients We recruited 27 patients with H7N9 virus\u2013mediated influenza and 30 healthy controls (HCs) the patients with avian influenza were recruited from the Inpatient Service at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine between 10 and 22 April 2013. 3.0 Hemoglobin (g/dl) 123 24 Platelet count (109/L) 132 46 Alanine aminotransferase (U/L) (n = 26) 36 (12 to 262) Creatinine (mol/L) 57 (25 to 266) Potassium (mmol/L) 4.37 0.48 Sodium (mmol/L) 139 4 International normalized ratio 1.08 0.093 D-dimer (g/L) (n = 26 the presence of the H7N9 virus in the collected sputum samples was determined by real-time RT-PCR as previously described. the sensitivity of these RT-PCR assays was approximately 100 copies/ml RNA. whole-blood samples were stained with antibodies against FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD38 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) whole-blood samples were stained with antibodies against FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 and HLA-DR + monocytes. the concentrations of individual serum cytokines were determined using a FlowCytomix Simplex Kit (Bender MedSystems/eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) the limitation of detection was 1.6 pg/ml for IFN-, 3.2 pg/ml for TNF-, 2.4 pg/ml for IL-1, 16.4 pg/ml for IL-2, 20.8 pg/ml for IL-4, all patients had H7N9 avian-origin influenza virus infection. of the 27 patients, 8 (29.6%) were smokers and 16 (59.3%) had a definitive history of poultry exposure. 55.6% of the patients had preexisting chronic diseases, such as hypertension. systemic inflammatory response syndrome components and clinical inflammatory markers in 27 patients with H7N9 virus infection a Variables Frequency Body temperature 36\u00b0C or >38\u00b0C, n (%) 24 (88.9) Heart rate >90 beats/min, n (%) 7 (25.9) Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 32 mmHg. serum interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), TNF- and interferon (IFN-) in individual samples. 66.7% of patients developed lymphocytopenia and 40.7% had abnormally low monocyte counts. 8.58% vs. 24.19 6.06% were significantly lower in the patients than in the HCs. no significant differences in the frequency of peripheral blood CD3 + CD4+ T cells and CD3 - CD56+ NK cells between the patients and the HCs. percentages of peripheral blood CD38 + CD4+ and CD38 + CD8+ T cells in the patients were significantly higher than those in the HCs (P = 0.0068 and P 0.001 for both) Flow cytometric analysis of the frequency of HLA-DR +. peripheral whole-blood samples were collected from 13 patients and 11 healthy controls, stained with the fluorescent antibodies against CD14 (anti-CD14) and major histocompatibility complex class II cell surface receptor encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA-DR) or T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (anti-Tim-3) data are presented as flowcharts and expressed as means of individual participants. most patients were in critical condition, with an average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 22.26 7.70, 70.4% developed ARDS and 48.1% had secondary infections in the respiratory tract. many patients developed severe complications, including liver damage (44.4%), renal injury (3.7%) and shock (22.2%) significantly higher levels of serum cytokines in patients with H7N9 avian influenza SIRS is a consequence of cytokine storm. we detected IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, but did not detect IFN-, TNF-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-4, IL-5 or IL-12p70. 66.7% of patients developed lymphocytopenia (lymphocytes 0.8 109/L) and 40.7% had abnormally low monocyte counts. but only 25.9% of patients had neutropenia (neutrophils 2.0 109/L) a statistical analysis was performed by Student\u2019s t-test. the percentages of peripheral blood CD38 + CD4+ and CD38 + CD8+ T cells in the patients were significantly higher than those in the HCs (P = 0.0068 and P 0.001 for both). peripheral whole blood was collected from 18 patients and 12 healthy controls. blood samples were stained with the fluorescent antibodies anti-CD3, anti-CD4/CD8 and anti-CD38 or anti-Tim-3. a high percentage of patients developed SIRS accompanied by a high percentage of activated T cells and increased levels of serum cytokines. the presence of SIRS is predictive of organ dysfunction and mortality. a high frequency of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), and its ligand 1 (PD-L1), that expressed T cells impaired T-cell responses to H1N1 infection in patients with influenza. it is possible that similar mechanisms may underlie the failure to detect abnormal levels of serum IFN- or TNF- in patients with severe avian influenza. in this study, we found significantly higher frequencies of CD38 + CD4+, CD38 + CD8+, Tim-3 + CD4+ and Tim-3 + CD8+ T cells in patients with H7N9 avian influenza compared with those in the HCs. the higher frequency of CD38+ and Tim-3+ T cells in patients with H7N9 avian influenza indicated that viral infection induced significant T-cell activation. however, Tim-3 on activated T cells usually provides a negative downregulation of HLA-DR expression usually represents the functional impairment of monocytes and is associated with adverse outcomes. we noted that nearly one-half of the patients in our study had evidence of secondary infection. this is because secondary bacterial or fungal infection is a common factor leading to mortality in patients with H7N9 avian influenza. patients with H7N9 avian influenza usually develop ARDS and secondary infection and have a high mortality rate. such immune derangement may contribute to the rapid progression of and high mortality associated with this disease. authors declare they have no competing interests. department of Zhejiang province (2012KYA087)."}
