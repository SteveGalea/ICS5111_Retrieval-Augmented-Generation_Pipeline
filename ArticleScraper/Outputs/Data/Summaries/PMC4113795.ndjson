{"summary": "the family Flaviviridae are enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. this family contains four different genera: Hepacivirus (from the Greek hepar, hepatos, \u201cliver\u201d), Flavivirus (from the Latin flavus, \u201cyellow\u201d) and the recently included genus Pegivirus [1,2]. flavivirus comprises 53 species and represents the largest genus within the family Flaviviridae. many of these viruses are transmitted by arthropods and therefore called ARBO viruses (arthropod-borne) pestiviruses cause a variety of diseases, including fever, encephalitis and hemorrhage. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is released into the cytoplasm, where it serves as messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of all viral proteins. most of these steps occur in close association with intracellular membranes that are rearranged upon viral infection giving rise to complex membranous replication factories. in 1997, Grief and coworkers described DENV-induced membrane alterations of various morphologies. EM studies indicated that VPs and CMs may represent the site of DENV replication and RNA translation/polyprotein processing respectively. TEM of resin-embedded cells revealed a complex collection of convoluted and vesicular structures, including CMs that were usually surrounded by multiple vesicles. by conventional EM, these vesicles appeared as double membrane vesicles. replication factories are a continuous membrane network that provides a platform for the transport of viral proteins and genomes between sites of RNA replication, ribosome-containing compartments (RNA translation) and virus assembly sites. this topological link may ensure efficient production and delivery of viral RNA for the assembly of infectious virus progeny. genus Hepacivirus is composed of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that seem to be formed asER protusions connected to ER membranes via neck-like structures. the ER is shown in yellow (DENV, TBEV and HCV) or in red (WNV) and the replication organelles in brown (DENV, TBEV and HCV) or in white (WNV) dsRNA was detected by immunolabeling with a dsRNA-specific antibody. in cells infected with TBEV, virus particles and membrane-connected vesicles were also observed inside the ER [25], similar to what was described for DENV and WNVKUN. treatment with brefeldin A (BFA) did not interfere with viral replication. single-membrane vesicles, ranging in diameter from 60\u2013100 nm, were found in proliferated ER areas. elongated vesicles or tubules were found that were much more prevalent in persistently than in acutely infected cells. tubules may be a feature of persistent infection, eventually linked to the high number of defective virus particles. a recent study identified 80 nm-diameter vesicles within the ER lumen of TBEV-infected BHK-21 cells and in cells transfected with a TBEV replicon. the vesicles are invaginations of the ER within a highly organized network of interconnected membranes with half of vesicles containing pore-like connections to the cytoplasm. however, no pore-like openings the presence of vesicles was also detected in monkey liver cells infected with yellow fever Virus (YFV). the findings indicate that all members of the genus Flavivirus utilize the ER as a source of membranes for the formation of their replication factories. assembly of new virions appears to occur at ER sacs in close proximity to the replication sites [15,35], thus creating an optimized membranous environment to support efficient viral replication. multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) with an average diameter of 390 nm are generated, likely originating from DMVs by secondary enwrapping events. vesicles in clusters, contiguous vesicles (CVs) and DMVs were small single-membrane vesicles of variable size (100\u2013200 nm), grouped together in well-delimited areas. RNA and these structures as well as CVs were very rarely observed in cells with a subgenomic JFH-1 variant designated Jc1 [48]. the first 3D reconstruction of a complete HCV-infected cell revealed that all these membrane structures were tightly connected and closely associated with LD clusters [47]. the findings indicate a fundamental role of DMVs in HCV replication. border disease Virus (BVDV)-infected cells contained several profiles of ER and many dense lamellar bodies. these lamellae were often found in association with rER. more recent studies on BVDV-infected cells revealed cytoplasmic vacuolization. pestiviruses are either using this compartment for replication or that viral RNA and proteins are transferred to this compartment for degradation. similar assumptions have been made for HIV [57] and marburg virus, a member of the Filoviridae family. TEM of resin-embedded cells revealed complex collection of convoluted and vesicular structures. the vesicles appeared as double membrane vesicles, likely corresponding to the VPs described earlier [13] immuno-EM confirmed that the vesicles visible in resin-embedded cells were induced by DENV infection and contained all NS proteins. osome-containing compartments (RNA translation) and virus assembly sites were found close to the pores of the replication vesicles. this topological link may ensure efficient production and delivery of viral RNA for the assembly of infectious virus progeny. CMs were absent from deNV-infected C6/36 mosquito cells. the ER is shown in yellow (DENV, TBEV and HCV) or in red (WNV) and the replication organelles in brown (DENV, TBEV and HCV) or in white (WNV) the outer and inner membranes of DMVs are depicted in different shades of brown (outer membrane in dark brown and inner membrane in light brown) the first reports on WNV-infected cells described the visualization of virions. dsRNA was only detected inside the vesicular structures within rER. this suggests that TBEV rearranges internal cell membranes to generate a compartment that protects viral RNA from detection by cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) this localization of dsRNA might suffice to delay the onset of the IFN response. single-membrane vesicles, ranging in diameter from 60\u2013100 nm, were often found within proliferated ER areas. in tick-infected cells elongated vesicles or tubules were found that were much more prevalent in persistently than in acutely infected cells. however, no pores between the tubules or towards the cytoplasm were observed. vesicles are invaginations of the ER within a highly organized network of interconnected membranes with half of vesicles containing pore-like connections to the cytoplasm. despite more extensive ER rearrangements in replicon cells, they contained fewer vesicles, consistent with the lower level of viral replication [36,37,38]. all members of the genus Flavivirus use the ER as a source of membranes for the formation of their replication factories. assembly of new virions appears to occur at ER sacs in close proximity to the replication sites [15,35] thus creating an optimized membranous environment to support efficient viral replication and assembly. vesicles in clusters (ViCs), contiguous vesicles (CVs) and DMVs were small single-membrane vesicles of variable size (100\u2013200 nm) most of them had an internal invagination. the CVs were small single-membrane vesicles, present in large numbers. the first 3D reconstruction of a complete HCV-infected cell revealed that all these membrane structures were tightly connected and closely associated with LD clusters [47] the findings indicate a fundamental role of DMVs in HCV replication. a comparison of the study by Ferraris and coworkers suggests that CVs might be also DMVs for several reasons. BVDV-infected cells contained rER modified into tubules. cytoplasmic vacuolization and VLPs in dilated ER cisternae have been reported. studies on the morphogenesis of pestiviral particles were hampered by a low rate of virion production. pestiviruses are either using this compartment for replication or that viral RNA and proteins are transferred to this compartment for degradation. similar assumptions have been made for HIV [57] and marburg virus, a member of the Filoviridae family [58,59] positive strand RNA viruses usurp and modify cell membranes of different origins to replicate their genomes. spherules (red arrows) are linked to spherules (red arrows) and spherules (red arrows). single-membrane structures are depicted in different shades of blue. these single membrane vesicles undergo secondary invaginations. this leads to the formation of vesiculated areas (VAs, red arrowheads) immuno-electron microscopy of MHV-induced membrane rearrangements revealed the appearance, in strict order, of DMVs (diameter 200\u2013300 nm), CMs, large virion-containing vacuoles, tubular bodies and cubic membrane structures. CMs were always surrounded by DMV clusters and were only observed in cells that appeared to be more advanced in infection. ER-derived DMVs with a diameter of 200 nm have been observed in primary avian and mammalian cells infected with IBV. most striking structures induced by IBV are zippered ER membranes. the zippered ER was associated to 60\u201380 nm diameter spherules, structures that are not present in cells infected with betacoronavirus. dsRNA is the presumed intermediate of viral RNA synthesis in the DMV interior. dsRNA is compartmentalized by the DMV membranes, suggesting dsRNA is compartmentalized by the membranes. a network of nucleocapsid protein-containing protein tubules was intertwined with the RVN. small clusters of single-membrane vesicles of 100\u2013200 nm diameter contain GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, but did not stain positive for calnexin, an ER marker. this does not exclude a role of the ER for biogenesis of these vesicles, because ER-resident proteins might be sorted out as these membranes are transformed. tubular clusters occur predominantly early in infection, whereas the number of DMVs increases as infection progresses. a subsequent enwrapping of these single-membrane tubules via an \u201cautophagy-like\u201d mechanism could lead to the formation of DMVs that have an average diameter of 159 nm 47 nm. this scenario would be consistent with the membrane surface of DMVs as an average-sized DMV with a diameter of 160 nm would be RUBV is an important human teratogenic virus. it is the only member of the genus Rubivirus (family Togaviridae) [82]. RUBV anchors its RNA synthesis machinery to membranes of a cell organelle. spherules are formed at the plasma membrane by a pore with a diameter of 5\u201310 nm. the inside of the spherule is connected to the cytoplasm by a pore with a diameter of 5\u201310 nm. time course studies revealed that the spherules undergo an unprecedented large-scale movement between cellular compartments. spherule-containing vesicles fuse with acidic endosomes and move along microtubules. this leads to the formation of a very stable compartment where the spherules accumulate as invaginations on the outer surface of unusually large, acidic vacuoles localized in the pericentriolar region. a complete rearrangement of the ER and loss of intact Golgi apparatus was observed. feline Calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus within this family, is a major agent of respiratory disease in cats. replication originates also membranous rearrangements and vesicles. other plant viruses like tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV, family Virgaviridae) [99], tobacco Echt Virus (TEV, family Potyviridae) [100] and Red Clover Necro membranes in closterovirus DMVs and VPs are likely to be derived from ER for members of the genus Crinivirus [114] or mitochondria in case of Ampelovirus [115,116]. Whether these structures are \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cnecked\u201d remain unknown. positive strand RNA viruses usurp and modify cell membranes of different origins to replicate their genomes. positive strand RNA viruses usurp and modify cell membranes of different origins to replicate their genomes. single-membrane structures are depicted in different shades of blue. these single membrane vesicles undergo secondary invaginations. these vesicles appear to originate from ER, trans-Golgi and endosomes. ER consists of convoluted membranes, numerous DMVs (diameter 200\u2013300 nm) and \u201cvesicle packets\u201d apparently arising from merging of DMVs. ET analyses failed to detect DMV connections to the cytoplasm to allow transport of nascent RNA. ER membranes are thought to be the lipid donor of the membranous replication compartment. ER-derived DMVs with a diameter of 200 nm have been observed in primary avian and mammalian cells infected with IBV. most striking structures induced by IBV are zippered ER membranes. the zippered ER was associated to 60\u201380 nm diameter spherules, structures that are not present in cells infected with betacoronaviruses. dsRNA is compartmentalized by the DMV membranes, according to ET. a network of nucleocapsid protein-containing protein tubules is intertwined with the RVN. a potential intermediate in nucleocapsid formation suggests arterivirus RNA synthesis and assembly are spatially coordinated. small clusters of single-membrane vesicles of 100\u2013200 nm diameter contain GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, but did not stain positive for calnexin, an ER marker. this does not exclude a role of the ER for biogenesis of these vesicles. similar results have been obtained with another member of the family Picornaviridae, coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) that a subsequent enwrapping of these single-membrane tubules could lead to the formation of DMVs that have an average diameter of 159 nm 47 nm. this scenario would be consistent with the membrane surface of DMVs as an average-sized DMV with a diameter of 160 nm would be equivalent to a tubule with a length of 632 nm. RUBV is an important human teratogenic virus. it is the only member of the genus Rubivirus (family Togaviridae) [82]. RUBV anchors its RNA synthesis machinery to membranes of a cell organelle. cells infected with alphaviruses contain large CPVs with a diameter ranging between 600 and 2000 nm. the inner surface of these CPVs is covered with small invaginations or spherules that originate at the plasma membrane [90,91,92] the inside of the spherule is connected to the cytoplasm by a pore with a diameter of 5\u201310 nm. spherule-containing vesicles fuse with acidic endosomes and move along microtubules. this leads to formation of a very stable compartment where the spherules accumulate as invaginations on the outer surface of unusually large, acidic vacuoles localized in the pericentriolar region. a complete rearrangement of the ER and loss of intact Golgi apparatus was observed. genus Vesivirus is a major agent of respiratory disease in cats. replication originates also membranous rearrangements and vesicles. other plant viruses like tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV, family Virgaviridae) [99], tobacco Echt Virus (TEV, family Potyviridae) [100] and Red Clover Necrosis Mosaic Virus (100) anchor replication sites on chloroplasts. ivesicular complexes often reside next to stacks of aligned filamentous BYV particles. membranes in closterovirus DMVs and VPs are likely to be derived from ER for members of the genus Crinivirus [114] or mitochondria in case of Ampelovirus [115,116] two main architectures of remodeled membranes (morphotypes) can be found that may reflect two alternative strategies to induce the membranous microenvironments required to allow virus replication. togaviruses RUBV Cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPVs) 600\u20132000 nm Lysosomes SFV CPVs with spherules: 600\u20132000 nm Spherules: 50 nm Flaviviruses DE icivirus MNV-1 200 nm ER/Golgi Closterovirus BYV 100 nm ER/Mitochondria Abbreviations: FHV, Flock House Virus; BMV, Brome Mosaic Virus; RUBV, Rubella Virus; DENV, dengue Virus; TBEV, Tick Borne Encephalitis Virus; MVEV, Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus; SLEV, despite belonging to the flavi-like supergroup, HCV induces DMVs. flaviviruses induce the formation of negatively curved membranes. it remains to be elucidated whether other members of the family Flaviviridae also utilize a picorna-like membrane remodeling strategy. dsRNA appears to represent a functional enigma in terms of RNA synthesis and transport. but the presence of dsRNA in the interior does not necessarily indicate active RNA replication. it is possible that DMVs either support RNA synthesis or serve as RNA storage sites (especially in case of closed DMVs) the mechanism responsible for DMV formation is not clear. in case of picornaviruses, it is thought that single-membrane structures are the precursors of DMVs. however, morphological resemblance of DMVs and autophagosomes is supported. autophagy machinery may also be involved in the formation of virus-induced membrane invaginations/spherules. the effects were moderate, arguing that this pathway may contribute to DENV replication to only minor extent. CMs are often associated with late stages of infection, suggesting that DMV formation might precede the development of CMs. the role of CMs for the viral replication cycle is not well understood. in MHV-infected cells, CMs appear to be connected with CMs. single-membrane vesicle inducers are key players in replication factory biogenesis. expression of NS protein 1a is sufficient to induce the formation of single-membrane spherules resembling those observed in infected cells. spherules had a diameter of 50\u201370 nm, resided in the ER lumen and were shown to be the site of viral RNA synthesis. p39 and p32 induced extensive reorganization of the ER and the nuclear envelope suggesting that the ER is the primary source of the membranous replication factory. NS4A is thought to contain a central peripheral membrane domain that intercalates into the luminal leaflet of the ER membrane. however, expression of NS4A lacking the C-terminal 2K fragment (corresponding to fully processed NS4A) induced ER membrane rearrangements reminiscent of CMs nsP1 is a monotopic membrane protein and its affinity for membranes is dictated by an amphipathic -helix. nsP1 contributes to the transport of the replicase polyprotein from the plasma membrane to the surface of endosomes. the size of the spherule is dependent on the length of the RNA template. the viral RNA template itself critically determines the morphology of the membranous vesicles. these rearrangements require the enteroviral proteins 2BC and 3A. NS4B is an integral membrane protein containing two amphipathic -helices. a highly conserved C-terminal domain is thought to harbor two -helices. mutations affecting the highly conserved C-terminal domain impairing NS4B self-interaction resulted in the formation of aberrant DMVs. p6 is predicted to contain seven transmembrane segments and a hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain. p6 was shown to induce vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II. this result suggests that autophagy might contribute to the formation of the membranous replication site of SARS-CoV. p30 induces significant reorganization of the ER into large, fenestrated membrane networks. expression of p39 and p32, two additional FCV NS proteins, induced extensive reorganization of the ER and the nuclear envelope suggesting that the ER is the primary source of the membranous replication factory. spherules of SFV arise by blebbing at the surface of the plasma membrane. nsP1 is a monotopic membrane protein and its affinity for membranes is dictated by an amphipathic -helix. nsP1 has a specific affinity for negatively charged phospholipids. nsP1 contributes to the transport of the replicase polyprotein from the plasma membrane to the surface of endosomes. nsp1 has to cooperate with other viral and cellular factors to allow formation of the cytoplasmic vacuoles. nsp1 has to cooperate with other viral and cellular factors to allow formation. NS5A-induced structures were capable of inducing membrane curvature. NS4B is an integral membrane protein containing two N-terminal amphipathic -helices. mutations affecting the highly conserved C-terminal domain impairing NS4B self-interaction. nsp6 was shown to induce vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II as well as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. this result suggests that autophagy might contribute to the formation of the membranous replication site of SARS-CoV. time to achieve efficient replication."}
