{"summary": "non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) constituted the principal public health response to the previous influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic. the study was conducted during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic and included 801 migrant participants living in border areas thought to be high risk by the Ministry of Public Health. non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were used during the 2009 pandemic. non-pharmaceutical interventions such as personal hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing and border measures constituted the principal tools employed in global efforts to mitigate the influenza A. proximity to international borders may increase likelihood of cross-border disease communication. proportions of migrants compared to Thai people living in border areas vary widely. there are an estimated two and a half million migrants providing unskilled labour in Thailand. use to be 'quite effective' in nearly 70% of respondents. positive perceptions were linked to higher levels of hand-washing and face mask use. a web application, research randomizer [14] randomly generated the specific household numbers to sample. data collectors approached members of the selected households and requested a volunteer from each household to complete the survey. it was felt that this would have turned our sample into a predominately male one and put unintended pressure on this person to participate. a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire was used to collect data. it was revised from a previous IOM influenza questionnaire. each translation was subjected to review by one author (NJ) and the one judged to be superior was blind back-translated. questionnaires were reviewed for completeness and logical data checks were made prior to computer data entry. questions arising were resolved with the MCHW. the first 20 questionnaires from each province were re-entered by one author. a web application was used to randomly generate the specific household numbers to sample. data collectors approached members of the selected households and requested a volunteer from each household to complete the survey. it was felt that this would have turned our sample into a predominately male one. subset of data presented in this paper contains information on socio-demographic factors and perceptions and practices relating to the following WHO-defined categories of NPIs. 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire was used to collect data. instrument was revised from a previous IOM influenza questionnaire. questions arising were resolved with the MCHW. the first 20 questionnaires from each province were re-entered by one author. feedback was given to the data-entry clerk, the error corrected, and the next 20 records examined similarly. median family income was USD94 (THB3000) per month and supported an average household of 4.6 family members. 73%) were unsure what action they would take or declined to answer the question. hospital (43%) was the preferred location for confinement, followed by the home (29%). most (70%) would feel more comfortable giving this information to a MCHW. less than half (48%) reported that they would be able to check their own temperature at home. the most common barriers to doing so were not owning a thermometer. 52% No 29% Unsure/Refused to answer 19% Advise contacts to defer travel to unaffected areas Potential action if outbreak/pandemic in community Do nothing 46% Move to another community in Thailand 11% Return to home country 3% Other 2% Unsure/Refused to answer 50% If borders were closed during pandemic: would postpone/cancel trip 60% Would travel through other routes 12% Other 2% Unsure/Refused to answer 26% *MHCW/V = 41% Unsure/Refused to answer 22% Avoiding public transportation Yes 36% No 46% Unsure/Refused to answer 19% Keeping children from school Yes 34% No 49% Unsure/Refused to answer 17% Avoiding the hospital Yes 31% No 48% Unsure/Refused to answer 20% Avoiding public health centre Yes 28% No 52% Unsure/Refused to answer 20% Disinfection measures Less than half of all respondents (46%) said they would increase hand washing frequency more than nine in ten would truthfully answer questions about their current health at a border crossing. most (86%) would agree not to cross the border if sick after leaving an area with disease outbreak. one quarter of respondents had used face masks in the past when sick. over half (53%) said they would not wear a face mask. only one third believed wearing a mask could prevent transmission of illness. nearly half of respondents agreed that banning cross-border travel during a pandemic could help prevent the spread of disease. just under half of respondents agreed that banning cross-border travel during a pandemic could help prevent the spread of disease. measures to increase social distance Respondents were asked if they thought various social distancing measures would be effective at reducing the spread of illness during periods of disease outbreak. Avoiding gatherings of five or more people received the most positive responses (54%), followed by avoiding places of entertainment (44%), avoiding department stores, supermarkets and minimarts (38%), avoiding restaurants (38%), limiting contact with family and friends (36%), keeping children from school (34%), avoiding the workplace (31%), avoiding the hospital no 52% Unsure/Refused to answer 20% Disinfection measures Less than half (45%) agreed that hand washing can reduce the transmission of illness during periods of disease outbreak. only 48% of those who would increase disinfection frequency during a pandemic would use some form of soap. a cross-sectional survey was conducted among vulnerable migrants in northern Thailand to gain a better understanding about their perceptions of various NPIs proposed by the WHO. the results demonstrate the existence of potential barriers to implementation during a pandemic, suggesting that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. 98.1% of people surveyed in Hong Kong surveyed would comply with quarantine measures. only 21% and 43% of participants would agree to home or hospital isolation. the gap between public education efforts and results highlights the inherent challenges in bringing health education to vulnerable migrant populations. many of the migrants in this study live in remote, hard to access areas and belong to diverse cultural and linguistic groups. results provide a baseline that may be useful in assessing public education efforts. external validity in this study was reinforced by random sampling of households and high participation rates. research into appropriate use of risk communication during inter-pandemic and pandemic periods, combined with ongoing education at the community level, could strengthen individuals\u2019 capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
