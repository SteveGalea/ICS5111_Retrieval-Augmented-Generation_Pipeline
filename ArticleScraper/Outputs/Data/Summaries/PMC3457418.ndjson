{"summary": "the boy, an 11-year-old boy, was managed by the pediatric department of Limoges University Hospital, France, for job's syndrome or hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome. other immunoglobulin levels were normal (IgM = 1.69 g/liter, IgG = 9.62 g/liter, and IgA = 1.47 g/liter) the boy presented with fever up to 38.5\u00b0C, productive cough, and an increased respiratory rate a parainfluenza type 3 virus was detected with the RV15 ACE kit (Seegene) the results were negative for 14 other viral pathogens. the boy's condition worsened on hospital day 7. his oxygen saturation was 89%, his temperature rose to 40\u00b0C. the boy was discharged after 40 days in hospital. he was readmitted with worsening respiratory function and recurrent fever. the chest radiography was identical to the first one. PCR was negative on a sputum sample. laboratory findings, chest radiography, and antibiotic treatment of an 11-year-old boy. opharyngeal aspirate collected on day 7 after admission and from sputum sample collected on day 55 were examined for macrolide resistance-associated mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. the sputum sample collected after macrolide treatment yielded two melting peaks, one with a melting temperature (Tm) corresponding to that of the wild-type genotype and the other with a Tm corresponding to that of the gene with the A2059G mutation. this isolate was also subtype 1 and MLVA type I. antibiotic susceptibility testing could not be performed for this isolate because of a yeast contamination. M. pneumoniae was recently reported to produce a community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin that induces pulmonary eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation in mice (11) eosinophilia and lymphocytosis were reported on day 55. the most frequently reported mutations are A2058G and A2059G in the 23S rRNA gene, with the A2059G substitution representing between 20 and 30% of all macrolide resistance-associated mutations in France (13, 16). this percentage is similar to the percentage of A2059G mutations reported in other parts of the world, such as Japan, the United States, Germany, and Italy (5, 8, 12, 21). we cannot exclude the possibility that the mutation was present at a very low level before treatment, as the real-time PCR and conventional sequencing methods used here to detect mutations may not have perfect sensitivity. however, emergence of the mutation during treatment is the most plausible hypothesis. current M. pneumoniae infection to enable prompt prescription of alternative antimicrobial regimen."}
