{"summary": "NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) CATALYZES THE RATE OF VIRUS DISCOVERY In the past decade, new developments in sequencing technology have led to a dramatic increase in the rate at which novel virus sequences have been discovered. in single studies of diverse specimen types, evidence for literally tens to hundreds of novel viruses can now be generated. this has resulted in a near-quadrupling of the number of unique virus species in GenBank since 2005 controversy over whether polyomaviruses play causal roles in human tumors. in 2008, NGS analysis of specimens collected from Merkel cell carcinoma identified a novel polyomavirus. the data accumulated to date provide the strongest evidence implicating a polyomavirus in a human cancer. astrovirus in brain tissue strongly implicates this virus as the cause of the patient's symptoms. additional NGS studies have also identified other novel astroviruses associated with neurologic diseases of cows and mink (5, 6) astrovirus PS is a virus that shares 95% nucleotide identity with astrovirus VA1. it represents the first example of astrovirus-associated neurologic disease in humans. additional NGS studies have also identified other novel astroviruses associated with neurologic diseases of cows and mink. a major finding of the past decade has been the identification of bats as a source of tremendous virus diversity. efforts to progress beyond discovery to experimentally characterize these viruses have been hampered by the general inability to cultivate the majority of the novel bat viruses in common mammalian cell lines. experimental conditions for infection of the laboratory reference C. elegans strain, as well as a viral reverse genetic system for Orsay virus (18), have now been established. these studies may not only provide new insights into invertebrate virology; because 40% of the genes in C. elegans are conserved in mammals. efforts to experimentally characterize bat viruses have been hampered by the general inability to cultivate the majority of novel bat viruses in common mammalian cell lines. significant effort in recent years has focused on developing bat reagents. such tools are critically important for defining the fundamental aspects of viral infection in bats. model system to define proviral and antiviral factors against this RNA virus. discovery of Toll in Drosophila and subsequent characterization of Toll-like receptors in vertebrates provide a paradigm for the power of model organism studies of infection and immunity. edward et al."}
