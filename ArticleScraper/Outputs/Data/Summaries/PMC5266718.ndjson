{"summary": "Spiroplasma eriocheiris is a causative agent of the tremor disease (TD) of mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. it is a novel pathogen of aquatic crustaceans including Procambarus clarki and Penaeus vannamei. S. eriocheiris was detected in the brain of embryonated chickens. it infects the newborn mouse and causes cataract. adult mice are not infected. the role and host interaction proteins of ALP in the process of S. eriocheiris infect mouse cells have not yet been defined. 3T6-Swiss albino cells were purchased from the Type Culture Collection cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee (Shanghai, China) 3T6 cells were infected with S. eriocheiris, which was treated with anti-ALP (1:2000) for 1 h at 30\u00b0C. 3T6 cells were treated with recombinant ALP (5 g/ml) for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. all host cells were cultured with same conditions 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. gene family, member A (RhoA), mouse-anti Phospho-Ras homolog gene family, member A (p-RhoA), mouse-anti -Catenin, mouse-anti Phospho- mouse -Catenin, mouse anti Akt, mouse-anti Phospho-Akt, anti-GST tag, and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Beyotime, China) and Goat anti- washed bacteria were suspended in a 10 mM NaCl solution containing 0.5 mM -mercaptoethanol. intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min. membranes were then collected by centrifugation at 34,000 g for 40 min.

Akt antibody, p-Akt antibody, and GAPDH antibody were visualized using ECL. all the Western blotting analysis were repeated on several occasions. the gray value of the bands was detected with the ImageJ software. total protein of S. eriocheiris, ALP antiserum (dilute1:2000) was used to determine if immunoaccessible domains were present on the surface of S. eriocheiris. western blotting was used to analyze the location of ALP, three lanes were represented. cells treated with S. eriocheiris (S. eriocheiris groups) and S. eriocheiris were incubated with anti-ALP or pre-immume serum (S. eriocheiris+anti-ALP groups or S. eriocheiris+serum) for 36 h. bacteria attached to the host cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Goat Anti-Rabbit Ig AH109 cells were transformed with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ALP and plated on SD without Trp (SD/-Trp) no blue reaction was detected in colonies with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ALP and pGBKT7-empty, confirming lack of autoactivation by ALP. Y2HGold yeast cells were cotransformed with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ALP and prey plasmid pGADT7-FBLN7 and -EIF2 as a control. pGBKT7 (empty vector) was used to cotransform with each prey. two proteins, EIF2 (full length) and FBLN7 (amino acids 211\u2013382), were selected to clone and obtain recombinant protein expression for further studies. recombinant proteins were purified using a gel Extraction kit. interaction between ALP and FBLN7 was detected by far-western blotting. the GST lanes are the control, and EIF and FBLN lanes represent the recombinant EIF and FBLN7, respectively. some special structural domains of FBLN7 were involved in specific interactions with the ALP. two other domains (EGF: 136\u2013172 aa and CCP: 81\u2013134 aa domains) were also tested by Far-western blotting. the protein ERK and p-ERK variation tendencies were detected by western blotting. 3T6 cells were treated with EGF for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. the relative protein (ERK, p-ERK, p-ERK, p-Catenin, Akt, p-Akt, RhoA, p-RhoA) expression changes were detected. expression of FBLN7 during different development times of mouse brain and eye were detected by western blotting. Statistical significance is indicated with an asterisk (*). expression of FBLN7 during mouse development. immuno-gold labeling showed native ALP localizes on the surface of the S. eriocheiris. western blotting was used to determine if immunoaccessible domains were present on the surface of the surface. pretreatment of S. eriocheiris with anti-ALP reduced infection of 3T6 cells. cells treated with S. eriocheiris (S. eriocheiris groups) and S. eriocheiris were incubated with anti-ALP or pre-immume serum (S. eriocheiris+anti-ALP groups) for 36 h. the results were detected by colony-lift filter -galactosidase assay. no blue reaction was detected in colonies with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ALP and pGBKT7-empty. the results were detected by colony-lift filter -galactosidase assay. positive hit of the screening. y2HGold yeast cells were cotransformed with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ALP and prey. plasmid pGADT7-FBLN7 was used to cotransform with each prey plasmid. pGBKT7 (empty vector) was used to cotransform with each prey plasmid. positive interactions were confirmed using yeast two-hybrid screening. ALP and FBLN7 proteins exhibited both diffuse and punctate cytoplasmic colocalization in the cell. the interaction between ALP and the domain of FBLN7 was detected by far-western blotting. 7 has been identified contain four domains (three EGF domains and one CCP domain) two other domains (EGF: 136\u2013172 aa and CCP: 81\u2013134 aa domains) were also tested by Far-western blotting. the results showed that specific bands were found only for the interaction of EGF domains and ALP. 3T6 cells were treated with rALP (5 g/ml) for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. protein ERK and p-ERK variation tendencies were detected by western blotting. the protein ERK, p-ERK, -Catenin, p--Catenin, Akt, p-Akt, RhoA, and p-RhoA variation tendencies were detected by western blotting. expression of FBLN7 during different development times of the mouse brain and eye were detected. S. eriocheiris was previously identified as a novel pathogen of E. sinensis. it also infected vertebrates, e.g., newborn mice, causing cataracts. the ALP of S. eriocheiris shared similarities with the adhesin-related protein SARP1 of S. citri. immunofluorescence experiments show ALP was involved in the infection of host cells by the bacterium. most occurrences of the EGF-like domain were found in the extracellular domain of membrane-bound proteins or secreted proteins. most occurrences of the EGF-like domain were found in the extracellular domain of membrane-bound proteins. the ability of ALP to interact with the EGF-like domain was shown. the extracellular regulated protein (ERK) kinases signal transduction pathways in 3T6 cells were restrained when cells were treated with rALP. the ERK pathway is one of the main downstream effectors of the EGFR. the Akt signaling play a crucial role in cell apoptosis, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell proliferationplays and immune responses on. when S. eriocheiris infects the host cells the EGFR signaling were restrained, and the cells normal metabolism were destroyed. the Akt signaling play a crucial role in the regulate of cell apoptosis. the expression levels of EGF appeared relatively stable during the early postnatal period and deeply dropped at postnatal 10 days. there is abundant EGF in the mouse brain at an early stage after birth. therefore, ALP promoted S. eriocheiris infection in animals by interacting with EGF. the small GTPase RhoA has been identified as a negative regulator of EGFR endocytosis via its effector Rho kinase. the fibulin7 protein duo to has servels EGF domain act as an adhesion sites of the bacteria. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. ocheiris has the ability to infect newborn mice and cause cataracts. the mouse on the left is a normal mouse injected with S. eriocheiris."}
