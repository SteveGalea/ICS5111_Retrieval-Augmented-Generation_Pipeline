{"summary": "dystrophin as the gene responsible for Duchenne muscular Dystrophy (DMD) has enabled researchers to identify several of the genes linked directly or indirectly to dystrophin. despite the diversity in phenotypic and pathological manifestation of various forms of muscular dystrophies identified to date, many display common symptoms. characteristic is the progressive loss of muscle mass which has been attributed, at least in part, to the inability of muscle stem cells to efficiently regenerate tissue lost as the result of the disease. satellite cells (SCs) are composed by an heterogeneous population of muscle stem cells distinguishable based on their gene expression signatures. differences in their ability to activate in response to specific queues have been described. other types of stem cells capable of assuming a myogenic cell fate have been described. proof-of-concept studies have been performed in immunosuppressed mdx mice that have been used as models for DMD. some success has been achieved using transplantation of freshly isolated SCs. issues remain that may hamper the applicability of cell-mediated regenerative approaches to muscle disorders. the use of gene editing in muscle stem cells for therapeutic purposes can be divided into two major applications. strategies aimed at targeting muscle stem cells ex vivo that can be used for transplantation and strategies aimed at targeting and correcting stem cells in situ following systemic administration of the therapeutic agent into the patient's own stem cells. gene editing mediated by ODNs generally employs short (less than 100 nucleotides) synthetic DNA or RNA sequences homologous to the region of the genomic DNA targeted for repair. oligonucleotides act at the messenger RNA level to block and redirect splicing of the mRNA to produce shorter but still functional proteins. the process requires multiple steps which begin with the pairing of the ODN with the region of the genomic DNA targeted for repair. recognition of the mismatch present on the ODNs activates innate repair mechanisms naturally present in the cell nuclei and capable of directing the correction based on information provided by the ODN template. chODNs were designed to pair with both strands of the gene targeted for repair and to activate DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. the activation results in the conversion of the targeted base at the genomic level using the information provided by the chODN. chODNs have been successfully applied in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. correction was demonstrated to be stably inherited in dividing cells. the chODN was able to distribute into approximately 40% of the SCs present in the muscle. a key advancement in vector development was the discovery that chODNs were as efficient as chODNs in directing the gene correction process. ssODN can either be complementary to the leading strand of the genomic loci or complimentary to the lagging strand. in muscle, gene correction mediated by ssODN has been assessed using the mdx5cv mouse. studies have focused primarily on identifying new generation of ssODNs that could promote more efficiently the repair process. some success has been obtained by increasing the stability of the ODNs. some success has been obtained by increasing the stability of the ssODNs. expression of full-length dystrophin was sustained for up to four months after injection. correction was shown to decrease over time as the result of normal muscle turnover. the first steps require the annealing of the ODN to the region of the genomic DNA targeted for repair. a two- to three-fold increase in frequencies of gene repair has been reported recently in primary cultures isolated from mdx5cv muscle transfected with targeting ssODNs. a siRNA designed to transiently downregulate Msh2 expression supporting the implication of the MMR as one of the mechanisms that controls ssODN-mediated gene repair in muscle cells. the approach involves the use of ssODNs containing methyl-CpG sequences and capable of activating the base excision repair (BER) mechanism through the recruitment of the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) also known as MED1. the approach involves the use of ssODNs containing methyl-CpG sequences and capable of activating the base excision repair mechanism. gene editing strategies mediated by ssODNs has been extended to iPSCs isolated from human skin fibroblasts of two patients affected by type I spinal muscular atrophy. ssODNs were used to correct gene defects and restore full-length dystrophin expression. gene paralogous to SMN1 to induce expression of a protein similar to SMN1. correction mediated by ssODNs targeting the SMN2 gene was achieved in approximately 4% of the transfected cells suggesting frequencies of gene repair similar to those observed in muscle culture. iPSCs are equally amenable to gene repair than myoblasts and SCs. chODNs were designed to pair with both strands of the gene

of gene repair has been reported recently in primary cultures isolated from mdx5cv muscle transfected with targeting ssODNs. the authors also failed to detect an effect when Msh2 was downregulated in purified myoblasts maintained in culture for prolonged period of time. acy of ssODNs in directing single base alterations at the genomic level have also evidenced the possibility of recruiting repair mechanisms other than HR and NER. the approach involves the use of ssODNs containing methyl-CpG sequences and capable of activating the base excision repair mechanism through the recruitment of the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4). authors isolated SCs from mdx5cv mouse and transfected PNA-ssODNs targeting the mdx5cv mutation prior to engraftment into immunocompromised mdx/nude mice. clusters of dystrophin-positive fibers were clearly detected immediately following transplantation and expression of dystrophin was shown to increase over time. gene paralogous to SMN1 induces expression of a protein similar to SMN1. correction mediated by ssODNs targeting the SMN2 gene was achieved in approximately 4% of the transfected cells suggesting frequencies of gene repair similar to those observed in muscle culture. iPSCs are equally amenable to gene repair than myoblasts and SCs. the ability of nucleases to recognize specific sequences in the genome has been known for almost two decades. but this technology has boomed only recently. this rapid growth is in part due to the crescent interest of commercial sources in developing new products that could be brought to the market. each TALEN contains the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease. each color represents a module for each of the four nucleotide bases. each color represents a module for each of the four nucleotide bases. the binding domains of the nucleases associate and generate a DSB which triggers the activation of specific repair mechanisms. in the absence of donor DNA sequences, the break is repaired by the NHEJ repair pathway by cleaving non-compatible overhang sequences and by joining the ends of the cleaved sequences. to date, ZFNs have been successfully employed to target drosophila. drosophila (Bibikova et al., 2002, 2003; Beumer et al., 2006, 2008, 2013; Bozas et al., 2009), plants. TALENs are artificial restriction enzymes generated by fusing a TAL effector DNA binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain. a recognition sequence of 14\u201320 bp is sufficient to confer specify toward the target site of the genomic DNA. a separation of 12\u201319 bp is sufficient to confer specify toward the target site of the genomic DNA. s appears to be ideal to guarantee efficient dimerization of the catalytic domain of the nuclease. the relative ease by which these nucleases can be assembled and the much lower cost of producing or purchasing custom vectors expressing a specific nuclease has enabled gene editing mediated by TALENs to boom in a relatively short period of time. a third class of nucleases has also been implemented as potential gene editing tools. MNs have been successfully applied to induce mutagenesis, recombination or gene targeting in bacteria (Cox et al., 2007; Flannagan et al., 2008); plants (Siebert and Puchta, 2002; Puchta and Fauser, 2013); mammalian cells (thermes et al., 2002; Epinat et al., 2003, 2013; Grosse et al., 2011; Izmiryan e the ability of MNs to induce indels in the dystrophin locus has also been demonstrated through studies aimed at determining the effect of chromatin accessibility on genome editing mediated by MNs. TALENs have been tested in primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from a DMD patient harboring a deletion of exons 46\u201350 ( 46\u201350) the robustness of the approach was further confirmed in immortalized myoblast cells lines isolated from two DMD patients with a deletion of exons 48\u201350 ( 48\u201350) also treatable by the same pair of TALENs used to correct the 46\u201350 fibroblasts. these studies have also established the feasibility of using TALEN-mediated NHEJ to target and correct dystrophin gene defects caused by large deletions further extending the applicability of the approach. plants (Shukla et al., 2009; Tovkach et al., 2009; Townsend et al., 2009; Marton et al., 2009; Osakabe et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Curtin et al., 2011); zebrafish (Doyon et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2008; Foley et al., 2008 TALENs are artificial restriction enzymes generated by fusing a TAL effector DNA binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain. a recognition sequence of 14\u201320 bp is sufficient to confer specify toward the target site of the genomic DNA, while a separation of 12\u201319 bp between FokI domains appears to be ideal to guarantee efficient dimerization of the catalytic domain. a third class of nucleases has also been implemented as potential gene editing tools. a third class of nucleases has also been implemented as potential gene editing tools. gan et al., 2008), plants (Siebert and Puchta, 2002; Puchta and Fauser, 2013) and mammalian cells (thermes et al., 2002; Epinat et al., 2003, 2013; Grosse et al., 2011; Izmiryan et al., 2011; Munoz et al., 2011; Menoret et al., 2013) have enabled the construction of the ability of MNs to induce indels in the dystrophin locus has also been demonstrated through studies aimed at determining the effect of chromatin accessibility on genome editing mediated by MNs. TALENs have been tested in primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from a DMD patient harboring a deletion of exons 46\u201350 ( 46\u201350) the same pair of TALENs used to correct the 46\u201350 fibroblasts. these studies have also established the feasibility of using TALEN-mediated NHEJ to target and correct dystrophin gene defects caused by large deletions further extending the applicability of the approach to the majority of the mutations causing DMD. lentiviral vectors have been shown to efficiently transduce stem cells. they can achieve high levels of transgene expression into cells. lentiviral vectors are known to randomly integrate into the genome. cleavage of regions other than those targeted for repair may lead to the inactivation of genes. cleavage of regions other than those targeted for repair poses serious safety concerns. future applications of gene editing targeting and employing stem cells will have to be further refined. clones obtained following selection and expansion can potentially be stored over prolonged periods of times, virtually the lifetime of the patient. clones obtained following selection and expansion can potentially serve as a reservoir of cells to be used in the event that repeated administrations are required. clinical applications to muscle disorders are likely to rely on the use of procedures capable of deliver genetically modified cells systemically. factors that can promote migration, survival, and engraftment of cells following administration are likely to have important implications for the success of cell-mediated regenerative approaches for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. several methods of delivery are currently being optimized and tested for their ability to distribute ODNs and nucleases into different organs and tissues following systemic administration. some success has been achieved using ODNs tagged to cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) which have been shown to successfully target and distribute ODNs into myofibers. studies aimed at further refine the efficacy and specificity of the repair process mediated by ODNs or nucleases are likely to have important implications for the success of gene editing approaches. toxicity, off-target effects, and low frequencies of gene repair may limit the beneficial effects achieved. gene editing approaches targeting stem cells ex vivo will require to refine culturing techniques to ensure that muscle stem cells can be efficiently propagated in vitro while maintaining maximum regenerative potential. a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate stem-cell properties will help redefine and select a specific population of cells that is safe to use in patients without compromising the beneficial effects that can be achieved using the approach."}
