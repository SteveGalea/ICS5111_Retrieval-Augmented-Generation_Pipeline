{"summary": "Influenzanet was launched in several european countries to monitor influenza-like illness during flu seasons with the help of volunteering participants and Web-based technologies. existing controversies and varying national ethical regulations can hamper efficient cross-border research collaboration to the detriment of quality disease surveillance. web-based technologies have become an integral part of public health surveillance over the last 2 decades. it is estimated that 4.3 billion people globally will have mobile broadband subscriptions by the end of 2017 [2]. real-time granular health data are collected from volunteering participants (eg, via mobile phones with global positioning), supplementing the big data collected by public health authorities and laboratories. Influenzanet is an innovative ILI surveillance network based on the active participation of public volunteers and the use of web-based technologies to report cases of ILI. the platforms will resume their activities if funding is made available by May 2018. however, the Netherlands-Belgium platforms have ceased their activities because of lack of funding. eg, underrepresentation of younger and older age groups, lack of virological confirmation of influenza cases, recruitment and motivation of participants to continuously donate their data for surveillance are problematic. some national platforms have developed mobile apps as additional data collection tools; for example, the Swiss mobile app gathers useful supplementary data through smartphone sensors. research collaboration and comparability of data are important because epidemics do not stop at national borders. varying ethical regulations at national levels can hamper collaboration between countries. a number of new ethical issues raised by Influenzanet-like activities do not or only partially fit traditional evaluation categories used by research ethics committees. participants through the provision of a: an informed consent and b: opt-out option); beneficence (direct and indirect benefits provided to Influenzanet participants via Web-based information on the study); nonmaleficence (prevention of informational harm to participants such as personal data protection measures, for example, anonymization of personal data); and justice (ensuring open and nondiscriminative participation of users to the Influenzanet network to ensure fairness in the distribution of benefits and risks) de Grote Griepmeting for the Netherlands and Belgium, Flusurvey for the United Kingdom and Ireland, Grippenet for Portugal and Spain, H\u00e4lsorapport for Sweden, Influmeter for Denmark, and Influweb for Italy. no papers on Influenzanet were found on the global digital library on ethics and BELIT. 10 of the 14 papers addressed some ethical, legal, and social components. 2 additional publications were included, leading to a total of 28 papers included in our analysis. BE, NL Guerrisi et al (2016) [33] BE, FR, IT, NL, PT, UK Kjelso et al (2016) [17] BE, DK, FR, IEi, IT, NL, PT, SE, ESj, UK Land-Zandstra et al (2016) [34] BE, NL Loubet et al (2016) [36] FR Marquet et al (2006) [21] NL Paol the information in Table 3 was collated from publications gathered in the literature search (Table 2) and additional information provided by country representatives. the information in Table 3 was subsequently double checked, updated, and corrected by country representatives. only 3 of 11 national platforms (Belgium-the Netherlands and Denmark) did not seek ethical approval by REC before the launch of their platforms. the Swiss national platform [45] has obtained ethical approval for the launch of its mobile app before the start of the flu season 2017/2018. this is the first scoping review examining the similarities and differences in the implementation of research ethics for the country platforms of Influenzanet. a number of ELSIs are similarly organized in the Consortium, for example, participation is open and nondiscriminative to all residents of these countries. REC approvals and informed e-consent were sought for recruiting participants and collecting their data in 8 of 11 and 9 of 11 platforms. national RECs, as well as RECs within the same country, may assess and balance risk-benefit ratios differently. divergences concerning the evaluation of similar Influenzanet projects in different countries could interfere with the harmonization of ethical approaches. informed e-consent was gathered from study participants from all platforms. the only exception being the Belgian and Dutch platforms. it can be argued that there is an automatic implicit consent for Belgian and Dutch participants because registration is voluntary. a detailed questionnaire revealing some very personal information can be seen as an intervention in the Netherlands [49]. it is important to understand the shift from typical physical or psychological harm seen in medical research to informational harm in public health research involving Web-based communities of volunteer citizens or big data. critics might say that e-consent gathered from Influenzanet participants does not represent valid informed consent because researchers cannot control that participants read and understood the information. anonymized data can be aggregated or not depending on whether the national partner who owns the data agrees to the request. linked anonymization [54] is involved in ensuring data protection, whereby participants\u2019 email addresses and pseudonyms are stripped from the gathered health-related data before analysis and stored separately. differences in the above mentioned national consent requirements could be the source of obstacles for the next generation of data collection. aims to harmonize data protection laws within the 28 European Union Member States. it will protect cross-border flows of personal data on European Union citizens to international organizations or third countries. aims to harmonize ethical requirements across the Consortium. we recommend more transparency in terms of ethical issues related to this type of technology-driven public health research. this type of research has the potential to save many lives in the future because it has proven through its flexibility, easy implementation, and adaptability to different countries\u2019 requirements for data collection. a number of ELSIs are similarly organized in the Consortium. participation is open and nondiscriminative to all residents of these countries. REC approvals and informed e-consent were sought for recruiting participants. REC approvals were not sought for the Belgian-Dutch (De Grote Griepmeting) and Danish (Influmeter) platforms (Influmeter, email communication, August 10, 2017) [6,20,21,46] but their studies abide by their national legislation on privacy and personal data protection. the Danish data protection agency does not consider emails exchanged between study participants and Influmeter as sensitive personal information. informed e-consent was gathered from study participants from all platforms. it can beargued that there is an automatic implicit consent for Belgian and Dutch participants because registration is voluntary. it is not clear whether informed consent was legally necessary in Belgium and the Netherlands. e-consent gathered from Influenzanet participants does not represent valid informed consent. researchers cannot control that participants read and understood the information. a valid consent can be assumed if there is an information sheet defining the study objectives and exact nature of questions. anonymized data shared with members of the Consortium can be aggregated or not depending on whether the national partner who owns the data agrees to the request. it is also worth noting that linked anonymization [54] is involved in ensuring data protection, whereby participants\u2019 email addresses and pseudonyms are stripped from the gathered health-related data before analysis and stored separately. differences in the above mentioned national consent requirements could be the source of obstacles for the next generation of data collection. a quicker harmonization alternative would be for all national platforms of Influenzanet to use the strictest consent requirements and practice currently used by one of their platforms to find common ground. limitations Only English-language papers were screened for this study for practical reasons. this type of research has the potential to save many lives in the future. this type of research has proven through its flexibility, easy implementation, and adaptability to different countries\u2019 requirements for data collection to serve as a potentially effective and relatively low-cost surveillance tool for other diseases of public health importance [12,17]."}
