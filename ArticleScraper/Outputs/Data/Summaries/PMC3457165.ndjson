{"summary": "SCoV is an enveloped virus carrying a long (27-kb), single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. the 5\u2032 two-thirds of SCoV genomic RNA, the gene 1 region, has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b. most of the gene 1 proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis, while some have other biological functions. nsp1 suppresses host innate immune responses by inhibiting type I interferon expression in infected cells. nsp1 does not induce endonucleolytic RNA cleavage of viral mRNAs. nsp1 does not induce endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in in vitro assays. BAC constructs encoding SCoV replicon cDNA were transfected into 293T cells. the cells were washed with DMEM three times before transfection. at 5 h posttransfection the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. first-strand cDNA was prepared by using an avian myeloblastosis virus. the 5\u2032UTR sequence of SCoV was connected downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. the fragment was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene into pcD-5\u2032luc. luciferase activity was determined by using a luciferase assay system. intracellular RNAs were prepared using Sepasol-RNA I SuperG reagent. electrophoresed through a 1% denaturing agarose gel using a formaldehyde-free RNA gel kit. visualization was with a digoxigenin (DIG) luminescence detection kit. RNAs were extracted by centrifugation after incubation with protein A/G Plus-Agarose. the pellets were washed four times in lysis buffer. the extracted RNAs were subjected to Northern blot analysis. the fragment was cloned back into pBAC-wt digested with SfoI and MluI. a gene with a transcription-regulating sequence was cloned into pBAC-wt and pBAC-R124A. plasmids were transfected into 293T cells or HeLa cells. pCAG-nsp1-wt and pCAG-K164A/H165A cloned into pCAGGS-MCS. pCAG-K47A, pCAG-K58A, pCAG-R124A, pCAG-R124A, pCAG-K125A, pCAG-K164A, and pCAG-H165A. the fragment was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene into pcD-5\u2032luc or pcD-luc. the 3\u2032UTR of SCoV was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene into pcD-5\u2032luc or pcD-luc, yielding pcD-5\u2032luc3\u2032 or pcD-luc3\u2032. the sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed with an ABI western blot analysis was performed as described previously (15) mouse anti-myc antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA), mouse anti-actin antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-N antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and anti-nsp1 antibody were used as primary antibodies. goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and goat anti-rabbit IgG\u2013HRP (Invitrog 293T cells transfected with 0.25 g of either pcD-luc or pcD-5\u2032luc were transfected with 1 g of either CAT RNA or nsp1 RNA at 24 h after primary transfection by using TransIT mRNA (Mirus) and then treated with 4 g/ml actinomycin D (ActD) at 1 h after RNA transfection for 8 h. pBAC-wt cDNA pCAG-CAT, encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and pCAG-K164A/H165A, encoding a mutant nsp1 lacking the ability to suppress host translation and promote host RNA degradation. luciferase expression in cells transfected with either pcD-5\u2032luc3\u2032 or pcD-5\u2032luc abrogated the suppression by nsp1-wt the SCoV 5\u2032UTR participates in evasion of nsp1-mediated shutoff. these results suggest that the SCoV 5\u2032UTR but not the 3\u2032UTR plays an important role in circumventing the nsp1-mediated shutoff. luciferase activity in 293T cells transfected with 0.5 g of either pCAG-nsp1-wt (wt), pCAG-K164A/H165A (K164A/H165A) or pCAG-CAT (CAT) together with 0.1 g of indicated reporter plasmids encoding Renilla luciferase were determined at 24 h posttransfection after standardization with those in cells expressing nsp1 is required for evasion of nsp1-mediated gene suppression. cells transfected with either pcD-luc, pcD-5\u2032luc3\u2032, pcD-5\u2032luc, or pcD-luc3\u2032 were harvested at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. nsp1 suppresses its own expression (15) RNAs extracted from precipitates were subjected to Northern blot analysis. precipitates were also subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody. SCoV uses a unique strategy to synthesize a set of subgenomic mRNAs that contain a common short 5\u2032-terminal \u201cleader\u201d sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome. we generated pcD-sg5\u2032luc by replacing the 5\u2032UTR of pcD-5\u2032luc with that of subgenomic mRNA9 and transfected it into 293T cells together with pCAG-nsp1-wt pcD-sg5\u2032N and pCAG-nsp1-wt were harvested at 24 h posttransfection. a specific interaction of nsp1 with the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV plays an important role in the efficient expression of viral proteins in cells expressing nsp1. the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV genomic RNA carries four major helical stem-loop structures designated SL1 to SL4. pcD-SL2luc, nt 43 to 55; pcD-SL3luc, nt 59 to 71; and pcD-SL4luc, nt 77 to 126. total RNAs extracted from the precipitates were subjected to Northern blot analysis. the 5\u2032UTR of the subgenomic mRNA9 contains three SL structures. interaction of SL1 in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV with nsp1 is crucial for evasion of nsp1-mediated translational suppression. white boxes, dashed lines, and black boxes indicate stem-loops (SL1, SL2, and SL4) in the 5\u2032UTR, deletions, and the firefly luciferase gene (luc), respectively. the bottom panel represents the amount of intracellular reporter RNAs in the lysates. luciferase activities in 293T cells transfected as described for panel B were determined at 24 h posttransfection after standardization with those in cells expressing CAT. SL1 in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV participates in evasion of nsp1-mediated translational suppression. both SL1 RNA and 5\u2032luc RNA were coimmunoprecipitated with nsp1-wt. no suppression of the luciferase expression was observed in cells transfected with either pcD-SL1luc or pcD-5\u2032luc together with pCAG-nsp1- expression levels of pCAG-K47A and pCAG-R124A/K125A were higher than those of nsp1-wt, while those of K58A were comparable to those of nsp1-wt. luciferase RNAs containing the 5\u2032UTR were coimmunoprecipitated with nsp1-wt, K47A, and K58A but not with R124A/K125A the amounts of luciferase RNA containing the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV were lower than those in cells expressing the wild type or K125A. however, no coprecipitation of the luciferase RNAs containing the 5\u2032UTR with R124A/K125A was detected. 293T cells transfected with 1 g of either expression plasmids as described for panel A. 0.2 g of pcD-5\u2032luc (5\u2032luc) were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody at 30 h posttransfection. RNAs extracted from the precipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a riboprobe for the luciferase gene. luciferase expression in nsp1 mutants was determined at 24 h posttransfection. expression of the wild type and each of the mutants of nsp1 but not of CAT exhibited a clear suppression of luciferase expression of pcD-luc. nsp1 mutants retained the ability to suppress the translation of mRNA lacking the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. luciferase activity in cells transfected with either pCAG-CAT, pCAG-nsp1-wt, pCAG-K164A/H165A, or pCAG-H165A together with pcD-5\u2032luc were determined at 24 h posttransfection. expression levels of K164A and H165A were lower than that of K164A/H165A but not with K164A/H165A. expression of nsp1 in 293T cells transfected with 1 g of either pCAG-nsp1-wt (wt), pCAG-K164A/H165A (K164A/H165A), pCAG-K164A (K164A), or pCAG-CAT (CAT) was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody at 24 h posttransfection. nsp1 enhances stability of RNA carrying the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. expression of pcD-5\u2032luc (5\u2032luc) increased in cells expressing nsp1-wt. binding of nsp1 specifically enhances stability of the RNA possessing the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. expression of nsp1-wt enhances stability of RNA carrying the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. 293T cells transfected with 0.25 g of either pcD-luc (luc) or pcD-5\u2032luc (5\u2032luc) were further transfected with 1 g each of RNAs carrying cap and poly(A) in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. V replicon, pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP (pBAC-wt) to generate pBAC-R124A. cells transfected with either pBAC-wt or pBAC-R124A were harvested at 12, 24, and 36 h posttransfection. expression levels of both the N and nsp1 proteins were also lower in cells transfected with pBAC-wt than in those transfected with pBAC-wt. 293T cells were transfected with 2.2 g of either pBAC-wt or pBAC-R124A. expression of viral RNA and proteins was determined at 12, 24, and 36 h posttransfection. expression of viral RNA and proteins was determined at 24 and 36 h posttransfection. total RNAs extracted from the cells were subjected to Northern blot analysis using a riboprobe for the Renilla luciferase gene (rluc) expression of nsp1 and actin was determined by Western blot analysis by using anti-myc and antiactin antibody. the values represent the means SD from three independent experiments. luciferase expression in cells transfected with pBAC-R124A-rluc was significantly lower than that of R124A at 36 h posttransfection. luciferase expression in cells transfected with pBAC-R124A-rluc was also higher in cells expressing nsp1-wt than in those expressing R124A. luciferase expression in cells transfected with pBAC-R124A-rluc was luciferase expression in 293T cells transfected with either pcD-5\u2032luc3\u2032 or pcD-5\u2032luc abrogated the suppression by nsp1-wt. similar results were obtained in HeLa cells and by using another reporter plasmid, pcD-5\u2032rluc, possessing the Renilla luciferase (rluc) gene under the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. these results suggest that the SCo total RNAs extracted from 293T cells transfected with pcD-luc and pCAG-nsp1-wt were subjected to Northern blot analysis by using a specific probe for the luciferase gene (luc) the expression of nsp1-wt decreased the amounts of luciferase mRNA at 24 h posttransfection. nsp1-wt compared with those in cells transfected with either K164A/H165A or CAT. similar results were also obtained in HeLa cells. these results suggest that the SCoV 5\u2032UTR has an ability to protect SCoV RNAs from nsp1-mediated RNA degradation. cD-5\u2032luc3\u2032 or pcD-5\u2032luc but not in those transfected with pcD-luc or pcD-luc3\u2032. specific interaction of nsp1 with the 5\u2032UTR confers resistance to nsp1-mediated gene suppression. RNAs extracted from precipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody. 293T cells transfected with 1 g of either pCAG-nsp1-wt (wt) or pCAG-CAT (CAT) together with 0.2 g of either pcD-N (N) or pcD-sg5\u2032N (sg5\u2032N) were subjected to Western blot analysis by using either anti-N (top), anti-myc (middle) or anti-actin (bottom) antibody at 24 cells transfected with either pcD-sg5\u2032luc or pcD-5\u2032luc were not decreased by the expression of nsp1-wt. these results suggest that SCoV escapes from the nsp1-mediated gene suppression through the interaction of nsp1 with the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. sequences of the SLs in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV were described in previous reports (5, 16) to determine the region(s) responsible for the specific interaction with nsp1 were generated. pcD-SL1luc, nucleotides (nt) 11 to 27; pcD-SL2luc, nt 43 to 55; pcD-SL3luc, nt 59 to 71; and pcD-SL4luc nsp1 in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV is responsible for a specific interaction with nsp1. nsp1 in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV is responsible for a specific interaction with nsp1. white boxes, dashed lines, and black boxes indicate stem-loops. p1-wt together with either 0.9 g of pcD-luc (luc), 0.9 g of pcD-SL1luc (SL1luc), or 0.2 g of pcD-5\u2032luc (5\u2032luc) RNAs extracted from precipitates were subjected to Northern blot analysis using a riboprobe for the luciferase gene. the bottom panel represents the amount of intracellular reporter RNAs in the lysates expression of nsp1-wt suppressed luciferase activities in cells transfected with pcD-SL1luc or pcD-luc but not in those transfected with pcD-5\u2032luc, pcD-SL2luc, pcD-SL3luc, or pcD-SL4luc. results indicate that SL1 in the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV participates in evasion of nsp interaction of the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV with nsp1 through R124 is required for evasion of nsp1-mediated translational suppression. the positively charged region composed of K47, R124, and K125 on the surface is involved in the interaction with mRNA (2). luciferase RNAs containing the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV were coimmunoprecipitated with pCAG-R124A and pCAG-K125A. the luciferase RNAs carrying the 5\u2032UTR were efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with K125A but not with R124A. the amounts of luciferase RNA containing the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV were lower 293T cells transfected with 1 g of either pCAG-nsp1-wt (wt) or pCAG-R124A/K125A (R124A/K125A), pCAG-R124A (R124A), pCAG-K125A (K125A), or pCAG-K58A (K58A) were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody at 24 h posttransfection luciferase activity in 293T cells transfected with 0.5 g of either expression plasmids as described for panel A or pCAG-CAT (CAT) together with 0.1 g of either pcD-luc (luc) or pcD-5\u2032luc (5\u2032luc) were determined at 24 h posttransfection after standardization with those in cells expressing CAT. expression plasmids pCAG-K164A and pCAG-H165A were generated. pCAG-CAT, pCAG-nsp1-wt, pCAG-K164A/H165A, pCAG-K164A, or pCAG-H165A together with pcD-5\u2032luc were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody at 24 h posttransfection. expression of the wild type and all of the mutant nsp1s exhibited no suppression of the luciferase expression of pcD-5\u2032luc. these results suggest that nsp1 has at least two functional domains that are responsible for RNA binding and translational shutoff. nsp1 enhances stability of RNA carrying the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV. cells transfected with either pcD-luc or pcD-5\u2032luc were further transfected with each of the in vitro-transcribed RNAs carrying a cap and poly(A) in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. the amount of the luciferase RNA lacking the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV was clearly decreased in cells expressing nsp1-wt compared with those expressing either R124A or CAT. expression of nsp1 enhances the stability of RNA carrying the 5\u2032UTR of SCoV through a specific interaction. 5\u2032UTR facilitates efficient replication of SCoV. we introduced an R124A mutation within the nsp1 gene of the parental SCoV replicon, pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP (pBAC-wt) to generate pBAC-R124A. cells transfected with either pBAC-wt or pBAC-wt were harvested at 12, 24, and 36 h posttransfection. transfected with either pBAC-wt-rluc or pBAC-R124A-rluc were determined at 12, 24, and 36 h posttransfection. luciferase activity in 293T cells transfected with 1 g of either pBAC-wt-rluc or pBAC-R124A-rluc was approximately 50% lower than that in cells transfected with pBAC-wt-rluc. 293T cells were transfected with 2.2 g of pBAC-R124A-rluc. expression of viral RNA and proteins was determined at 24 and 36 h posttransfection. expression of nsp1 and actin was determined by Western blot analysis. nsp1 is the first viral protein that suppresses host gene expression by targeting the 40S ribosome complex. the nsp1-40S ribosome complex modifies the 5\u2032 regions of capped mRNA templates. nsp1 induces endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5\u2032UTR of the capped mRNA. nsp1 was shown to confer resistance to the nsp1-mediated translational shutoff. however, the precise mechanisms by which nsp1 RNA resists the translational shutoff are poorly understood. the target RNA(s) of the SCoV nsp1 has not been identified yet. the precise RNA-binding domain has not been identified in BCoV nsp1. previous reports have shown that the SL structures of coronavirus are required for RNA synthesis and gene expression. nsp1 mutant failed to stabilize RNA carrying the sequence in the SCoV 5\u2032UTR. the specific interaction of nsp1 with SL1 may participate in the evasion of the viral RNA from degradation by the host RNase. if nsp1 is still capable of binding to 40S ribosomes upon interaction with SL1, the translation of viral RNAs should be suppressed. interaction of nsp1 with SL1 induces evasion of RNA degradation. however, the nsp1 mutant K164A failed to suppress the nsp1-mediated translational shutoff, suggesting that SCoV nsp1 has two distinguishable functional domains responsible for RNA binding and translational shutoff. Poliovirus virus 2Apro suppresses cap-dependent translation by cleavage of the N terminus of eIF4G. translation of viral RNA takes place in a cap-independent manner through the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which recruits the C-terminal fragment of eIF4G."}
