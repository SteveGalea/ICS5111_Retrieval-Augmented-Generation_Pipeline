{"summary": "infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of the upper respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens. the virus is the coronavirus of the domestic fowl that is observed in chicken. more than 50 different serotypes have been listed and new IBV variants continue to emerge. there has been no report on the prevalence rate of IBV genotypes in the south of Iraq. the aim of the present study was to detect of three IBV genotypes including (Massachusetts; Mass), 793/B and D274 in the south of Iraq. -CACCACCAGAACCTCTC-BHQ1 were used to amplify and detect a 143-bp fragment of the 5\u2019-untranslated region (5\u2019UTR) the mixture for each tube was consisted of 13 L TaqMan Master Mix, 0.2 L of 2 pM IBV probe, 1 L of 10 pM forward primer, 1 L of 10 pM reverse primer, 2.8 L distilled water, to reach a total volume of 18 L. 94 C for 5 min, 94 C for 45 sec, 58 C for 45 sec, 58 C for 45 sec, 72 C for 90 sec, and 72 C for 5 min) in the second round nested PCR we used (2 L distilled water, 13 L 2X PCR master mix (Sinaclon Co.), 1 L forward Primer (XCE3-), 1 L reverse primer (DCE1+) and or MCE1+, BCE1 + and 3 L RT- 35.00% of positive samples were from Basra, 35.00% from Thi-Qar and 30.00% from Muthana governorates. the results of nested PCR revealed that (50.00%), (5.89%), and (44.11%) of these flocks have 793/B, Mass, and unknown strains, subsequently. the present study indicated a relatively high prevalence of 793/B IBV genotype in the south of Iraq. the original serotype Mass has now been spread worldwide and is included in most of the commercially available vaccines. the results showed the distribution of 793/B and Mass genotypes with the prevalence rate of 50.00% and 5.89%, respectively. study in the middle of Iraq showed that 92.10% of samples collected from suspected flocks were infected with IBV, 20.00% of samples were infected with IB alone. 45.71% of samples with IB combined with both mycoplasma galisepticum and avian influenza virus subtype H9 were positive to both IBV and AIV(H9). large number of IBV variants exist worldwide, some being unique to a particular area and others having a more general distribution. geographical isolation and control measures employed in countries may play a significant role in preventing entry of IBV variants. recent discoveries of IBV and IBV-like strains in other species of birds other than the chicken,27 like geese, ducks, and pigeons might also play roles in the spread of IBV strains over the world."}
