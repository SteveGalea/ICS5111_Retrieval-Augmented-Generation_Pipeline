{"summary": "the 20th anniversary of the treaty offers a unique opportunity to take stock of EU health actions by giving an overview of influential public health related EU-level policy outputs. respondents were asked to name EU policies or actions they perceived as an achievement, a failure or a missed opportunity. the original health mandate was enshrined in Article 168 of the Lisbon treaty. it embodied the Union with only limited legislative powers on health matters. the original health mandate focused primarily on stimulating cooperation between member states and supporting national actions. 1993 maastricht treaty: the legal basis for undertaking actions in the field of public health is defined in Article 3(o) and Article 129. despite its narrow legislative scope, the health mandate has triggered important european actions in certain public health areas. stakeholders in the field provide examples indicating public health relevant EU policies do not always meet the expectations of the public health community. authors express concerns about potentially detrimental health effects or disappointment about the support of the policies and approaches aimed at improving health in Europe [27,28] the study adhered to the RATS guidelines on qualitative research [33]. experts were purposely selected to ensure heterogeneity of opinions. the selection was based on their individual profile and professional affiliation. interviews lasted from 35 to 90 minutes. all interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymized. guide was developed on the basis of previous desktop research and an internal brainstorming session. the analysis was jointly performed by the principal investigators using NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 9) the results of the content analysis on achievements, failures and missed opportunities were grouped according to the major common themes in a table. three researchers in the primary research group met regularly during the interview period. the primary research group was experienced in EU public health policy research or qualitative research methodologies. the confirmability was strengthened by the use of several investigators in the data collection process and analysis phase. selected sample and eleven were identified during the snowball sampling procedure based on recommendations of already interviewed experts. the majority of experts was affiliated to an institution located in Brussels (n = 10) the semi-structured interview guide was used as a framework for the interviews. the three principal investigators initially performed an internal analysis of each separate interview and an analysis across interviews to identify the scope of EU-level actions. the results of the content analysis on achievements, failures and missed opportunities were grouped according to the major common themes. participants were asked in an online survey to select three outputs per category. based on their opinion, a ranking in terms of a frequency distribution of selected influential policy outputs for each category was determined. the online survey was completed by 18 out of 20 participants who took part in the interviews. a set of conditions were identified in the interviews that described and advanced the role of EU health policy as a reference point for public health. a set of conditions were identified in the interviews that described and advanced the role of EU health policy as a reference point for public health. the ranking of influential policy outputs of EU-level health policy-making is provided in Table 3. agency 15 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 13 European Food Safety Authority 9 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies 6 European Agency for Accreditation of Education in Public Health 1 European Chemicals Agency 1 European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions 1 European Commission Joint Research Centre institutes 0 Health Intergroup at the Committee of the Regions 0 Networks, policy platforms, cooperation European presidencies 13 Cooperation EC with OECD and WHO 8 European Health Policy Forum 6 Network epidemiological surveillance and control of infectious diseases 6 Network in the category entitled \"soft laws, strategies, and programmes\", the first and second public health programmes were selected most frequently, followed by the 2008\u20132013 health strategy \u201cTogether for Health\u201d [42] (n = 6). the third rank is shared by three policy outputs: the \"Framework for action in the field of public health\" the label \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d was allocated to the insufficient degree to which the HiAP approach is implemented. the label \u201cfailure\u201d was less often assigned with the missing integration or link to social policies appearing in some interviews under this heading. eCDC mandate should include responsibilities in risk management of infectious diseases. EMA Coordination of approval of efficacy, safety and quality of drugs. problem of not being able to tackle pharmaceutical pricing. unrecognized potential for health of the CAP by public health sector. health information Health life years as indicator in the Lisbon strategy. OECD: world health organization. DG SANCO formed in 1999 as an independent, formal structure for health policy. DG SANCO separated health dossier from DG V, former DG with responsibility for health policy. health is not among the headline targets, it\u2019s not among the flagships. the potential for the \"Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\" under the European Innovation Union appeared as a unique theme and was regarded as an achievement for strengthening health policy on the general EU policy agenda. a number of respondents were critical of the scope of the ECDC mandate. some argued that DG SANCO\u2019s collaboration with international organizations can be considered as an achievement. others assert that this collaboration was not sufficiently established and can therefore be categorized as a missed opportunity. the largest burden of disease in the EU is caused by non-infectious rather than infectious diseases. a call was put forward to further increase the mandate of the ECDC to all public health relevant aspects. the work regarding tobacco was regarded as an achievement of how european health policy-making effectively addressed a life style risk factor for health. the progress around tobacco was regarded as an achievement of how. european health policy-making effectively addressed a life style risk factor for health. the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was named as an example of an achievement as well as a failure. the failure aspect of the platform was related to the perception that a platform is a rather weak policy instrument. the lack of timely cooperation of public health professionals with other sectors such as agriculture was raised as missed opportunity. the TFEU put limits on the internal market on the grounds of public safety, public morality and public health. it was perceived as a missed opportunity that this potential had not been fully taken up by public health experts. this was positively exemplified by the case of tobacco control. the patients\u2019 Directive will lead to more cross-border cooperation. there were also critical voices that interpreted the Directive as targeting a limited segment of the European population and thus, increasing health inequalities. european court of justice 12 Directive on patients\u2019 rights in cross-border care 10 Directive on tobacco advertising 9 Directive on blood safety 5 WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 4 Directive on professional qualifications 3 Regulation 1408/71 3 Directives on tobacco products 2 REACH regulation of chemical substances 2 Soft laws, strategies and programmes 5 Europe 2020, Europe\u2019s growth strategy 5 Health in all Policies 4 Information to Patients 3 Open Method of Coordination 3 Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities 3 Open Method of Coordination 3 Solidarity DG SANCO: Association of Schoold for Public Health in the European Region. in the category \u201csecondary legislation and court decisions\u201d, the patients\u2019 rights decisions made by the European Court of Justice were chosen as influential policy output. the first and second public health programmes were selected most frequently, followed by the 2008\u20132013 health strategy \u201cTogether for Health\u201d [42] (n = 6) the three entries on the third rank include the EU Health Policy Forum (n = 6), the network on epidemiological surveillance and control of infectious diseases (n = 6), and the network on health technology assessment (n = 6). the fifth category was not topic specific therefore work on European level health determinants (n = 10), the exchange of best practices (n = 8), and published scientific reports which influenced EU policy-making (n = 7) were ranked on the first three positions. DG SANCO is not strong enough to push health in other DGs. DG SANCO is not strong enough to push health in other DGs. tobacco regulation has some aspects of failure since a strict, general ban is not reached. tobacco regulation has some aspects of failure since a strict, general ban is not reached. governmental issues White paper on governance (2001) increased transparency. more standardisation of methods (evaluation of indicators, outcomes, policies) and common language. cooperation with industry influences the health research agenda and policy-making. DG SANCO was a big DG and then DG SANCO became separate from that. DG SANCO was seen as a beneficial way forward for the DG to shift its sectorial policy approach from a focus on specific topics such as cancer, drug dependence, health monitoring, accidents and injuries, or pollution-related diseases. the potential for the \"Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\" under the European Innovation Union appeared as a unique theme and was regarded as an achievement for strengthening health policy on the general EU policy agenda. some argued that DG SANCO\u2019s collaboration with international organizations like the WHO-EUR or the OECD is improving. a number of respondents were critical of the scope of the ECDC mandate. questions were raised on whether the ECDC\u2019s responsibility in surveillance, risk assessment and training is sufficient or if additional responsibilities in risk communication and management were needed to assure full stewardship. health impact assessment, the implementing tool to HiAP, was regarded as a \u201ctick box exercise\u201d (#03, #15, both public health advisor/advocate) however, participants commonly perceived HiAP as a missed opportunity. the achievements recognized in EU tobacco legislation were missed in regulation of other health-related life style factors such as nutrition and alcohol. regulations in the area of food safety were generally acknowledged as an achievement by preventing food-borne health threats. a potential mandate to address the composition of food seemed to be neglected and was labeled as a missed opportunity. internal market provisions were perceived as ambivalent by respondents. the influence of EU market regulations, for example on alcohol policies, was perceived as a failure when member states had more protective and stricter national legislation. patients\u2019 rights Directive in cross-border healthcare was mainly regarded as an important achievement. it is the first EU secondary legislation ever enacted specifically on healthcare. thereby, it was expected that the Directive will influence people who seek healthcare services in other countries. study provides an overview of public health relevant EU-level actions of the past twenty years. assessment of outputs or actions being an achievement appeared across and within interviews along with assessments of outputs or actions being a missed opportunity and less often a failure. findings confirm the challenge of implementation in the EU [28,49] the task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential. some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure. however, further efforts are needed to implement and maintain health indicators. a final judgment on the impact of facilitating collaboration is to be awaited. it will require different ways of measuring \u2018impact\u2019 compared to the analysis of domestic adaptations when implementing EU hard law. some participants were in favor of more EU influence on health policies. underlying themes such as cooperation among european public health professionals, increasing institutionalization, and characteristics such as the issue of subsidiarity influenced experts\u2019 perceptions throughout the topics presented in this paper. the findings of the study may not be empirically generalizable since they were closely linked to qualitative individual perceptions. the task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential. some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure. however, further efforts are needed to implement and maintain health indicators. assessment of EC tasks for public health policy making has been influenced by characteristics like the subsidiarity principle. some participants were in favor of more EU influence on health policies and their implementation. study demonstrated a 'chaordic dynamics' of european integration in the field of health policies. but the logic of action in the field can involve diverging interests. some were identified because they increased the strength or value of EU-level public health policy. others were identified because they impacted the health of the european population. only seven out of 28 EU member states organized health and social affairs within one ministry (Spain, France, Sweden, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Greece, the Netherlands). Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. we would like to express our sincere thanks to the experts who invested their time and participated in the interviews. their views and perceptions on european public health policy were highly valued."}
