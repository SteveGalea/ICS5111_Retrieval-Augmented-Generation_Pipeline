{"summary": "80% of hepatitis C infections become chronic, with many cases necessitating antiviral treatment. hepatitis C patients have a high risk of developing hepatic steatosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. a protective HCV vaccine still is unavailable. dEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X) is a ubiquitous, multifunctional ATP-dependent RNA helicase and an RNA-dependent ATPase. DDX3X also has been shown to be involved in the cellular stress response and stress granule assembly independent of its RNA helicase activity (11) DDX3X binds to and redistributes DDX3X to the viral assembly sites around LDs. this interaction is dispensable not only for HCV replication but also for HCV-triggered activation of the DDX3X\u2013IKK- pathway. mouse (C7-50) -HCV core protein (MA1-080; Thermo Scientific), mouse (8 G-2) -HCV NS3 (ab65407; Abcam), rabbit -DDX3X antibody (A300-474A, Bethyl Laboratories), purified mouse -human IKK- (clone B78-1; BD Pharmingen), rabbit -IKK- (ab4111; Abcam), mouse -G3BP ( Alexa Fluor 488 goat -mouse IgG (A11001; Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 568 goat -rabbit IgG (A11004; Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 647 goat -rabbit IgG (A21235; Life Technologies), goat -mouse IgG (A21244; Life Technologies), and goat -rabbit IgG (A0545; Sigma) plasmid was a gift of Ebrahim Z EGFP was amplified from pEGFP-N1 plasmid using primers 5\u2032-CCC CTA GGG ATG GTG AAG GGC GAG-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-GAG GCG GCT TGT ACA GCT CCA TGC-5\u2032. in vitro transcription was performed by using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) total RNA was isolated from whole-cell lysate using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) or from culture medium with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) the relative amount of HCV RNA was normalized to the internal-control human 18S rRNA (Applied Biosystems) ilicate 4-well chamber coverslips (Nunc) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with blocking solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells then were labeled with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 1% BSA.

DDX3X has been shown to specifically bind to RNA containing a complex secondary structure and function as a pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity. in the poly(IC)-treated cells, we observed that DDX3X and IKK- also similarly redistributed to the SGs. scale bars, 10 m. (A) DDX3X\u2013IKK- granules and LDs. colors in the far right picture were digitally changed for better visualization of IKK- (green instead of magenta) and DDX3X (red) DDX3X, but not IKK-, also exhibited numerous smaller (1 m in diameter) and round structures that surrounded the LDs. DDX3X structures predominantly colocalized with HCV core protein. large, irregular-shaped DDX3X granules did not. cc infection in triggering DDX3X and IKK- redistribution suggests a sequential and dynamic relocalization of these proteins from early to late infection. the comparison groups are DDX3X with IKK- (far left), DDX3X with G3BP1 (second from the left), and DDX3X with HCV core protein (far right). striped bars represent percentages of cells with both colocalized and noncolocalized granules. at least 40 cells for each protein were counted, and percentages of cells with each pattern of granular structure are shown. no DDX3X granular structures could be detected at the time of HCV inoculation. DDX3X, G3BP1, and LDs were stained for 0.5 to 72 h. colors on the far right were modified for better visualization of DDX3X. five to 10 confocal microscopic images from at least three independent experiments were analyzed for colocalization signals. \u2032UTR RNA transfection only stimulated large DDX3X-SG structures. different patterns of DDX3X granular structures coexist in a population of HCV-infected cells. DDX3X colocalized with SGs or LDs. DDX3X has been shown to be important for HCV replication. we silenced DDX3X in hepatocytes using siRNA. DDX3X led to significant inhibition of intracellular and extracellular RNA levels. silencing of G3BP1 or PKR (protein kinase R), but not IKK- or PABP1 expression, abrogated the formation of HCV-induced SGs detected with a specific anti-G3BP1 antibody. in infected cells deprived of DDX3X, no SG was induced either. colocalization of DDX3X and HCV core protein on LDs is independent of the SG\u2013DDX3X\u2013IKK-mediated signaling pathway. these results suggest the importance of SGs in the recruitment of IKK- by DDX3X upon HCV infection. a subgenomic replicon of JFH-1 encoding only the nonstructural proteins, the complete genome of JFH-1, and two chimeras of JFH-1, Con1/C3 and Jc1 expressed the structural proteins of either Con1 (genotype 1b) or J6 (genotype 2a) at 2 days posttransfection, cells were examined by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. similar patterns of NS5A or LD association were observed for SGs with G3BP1 staining. these data suggest that HCV nonstructural proteins mediate the localization of DDX3X-SG complex to the membranous web on the ER. NS5A (A), NS3 (not shown), or core protein (not shown) results shown are percentages of cells that are HCV protein negative and either with (blue striped bars) or without (light gray striped bars) DDX3X granules and cells that are HCV protein positive and either with (blue bars) or without (light gray striped bars) DDX3X granules. six to 12 randomly selected microscopic images from at least three independent experiments with a total of 80 cells were analyzed for the presence or absence of SGs in HCV protein-positive or -negative cells. results shown are percentages of cells that are HCV protein negative and either with (blue striped bars) or without (light gray striped bars) SGs. in cells that exhibited DDX3X and LD colocalization, the granular cytoplasmic structures of IKK- no longer existed. the association between IKK-, DDX3X, SGs, and LDs upon HCV infection was shown in Fig. 3. Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with JFH-1 HCVcc for 48 h (A) or were transfected with various plasmids encoding HCV proteins for 24 h (B) the subcellular localization of IKK- and its association with HCV proteins were detected and analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. DDX3X and IKK- formed large granular cytoplasmic structures that did not colocalize with LDs. DDX3X-IKK- granules stimulated by HCV 3\u2032UTR RNA also did not colocalize with mitochondria (MitoTracker was used as a marker), peroxisomes (catalase as a marker) DDX3X (A and B) and G3BP1 (a SG marker) (D) were detected with specific primary mouse antibodies. IKK- (A and D) and G3BP1 (a SG marker) (a SG marker) (a SG marker) (d) were detected with specific primary mouse antibodies. HCV infection triggers DDX3X and IKK- redistribution to SGs and P bodies. DDX3X\u2013IKK- granules colocalized with SGs (blue bars) or not colocalized (blue striped bars) the physical interaction of DDX3X and G3BP1 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation assay. together, these results demonstrate that two forms of DDX3X granular structures are generated by stimulation with HCV infection in hepatocytes. the differential phenotypes manifest by HCV 3\u2032UTR RNA transfection or HCVcc infection in triggering DDX3X and IKK- redistribution suggest that a sequential and dynamic the comparison groups are DDX3X with IKK- (far left), DDX3X with G3BP1 (second from the left), and DDX3X with HCV core protein (far right) results shown are percentages of cells without any granular structures (light gray striped bars) or those with granular structures either colocalized with each other (blue striped bars) DDX3X granules were not triggered by inoculation of cells with culture supernatant from naive cells or with heat-inactivated JFH-1 HCVcc. they may be induced by HCV 3\u2032UTR RNA that is present in newly infected cells either just after inoculation or as the virus spreads and infects naive neighboring cells. the formation of these structures suggests that DDX3X redistributes with core protein to the LDs when HCV protein expression is robust late during infection. some DDX3X-core protein-containing structures at the LD surface were stained positive for SG-associated proteins 48 h postinfection. cells were classified into four groups according to the presence or absence of DDX3X granules and their association with SGs or LDs. five to 10 randomly selected fields with a total of at least 60 cells were counted. depletion of DDX3X in cells significantly inhibited translation and viral replication. we knocked down three major SG-nucleating proteins: G3BP1, TIA1 and its paralog, TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein-like 1 (TIAL1) depleted various SG-associated proteins by siRNAs. the association of DDX3X with the large SG was observed in infected cells despite the silencing of IKK- expression. this is consistent with our previous finding that DDX3X functions upstream of IKK- in this signaling cascade (21). DDX3X staining in complex with HCV core protein on the surface of LDs still was detected in these cells. small DDX3X granules are associated with LDs in G3BP1-silenced cells. small DDX3X granules are associated with LDs in G3BP1-silenced cells. the majority of the cells produced HCV proteins (NS5A or NS3) at detectable levels. most of these viral protein-expressing cells showed DDX3X granules. similar patterns of NS5A or LD association were observed for SGs with G3BP1 staining. DDX3X, NS5A, and LD staining in cells treated with various HCV RNAs are shown on the right. colors of pictures on the far right were digitally changed for better visualization of NS5A (green instead of magenta) and DDX3X (red) in vitro-transcribed control RNA (Ctrl), SGR2a, JFH-1, Con1/C3 or Jc1 chimera RNA-transfected Huh-7.5.1 cells were stained for HCV NS5A, SGs, and LDs. Magnifications of selected areas were digitally changed for better visualization of NS5A and G3BP1 (red) 3\u2032UTR mediates the formation of a DDX3X\u2013IKK- complex. this leads to IKK- activation and nuclear translocation for downstream transcriptional functions. at 24 h postinfection, a smaller population of DDX3X colocalized with LDs was observed. however, the granular cytoplasmic structures of IKK- no longer existed. NS3 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with DDX3X and IKK- in cells transfected with subgenomic or full-length HCV RNA. NS3 protein also was coimmunoprecipitated with DDX3X and IKK- in cells transfected with subgenomic or full-length HCV RNA. cells were transfected with in vitro-transcribed EGFP control RNA (Ctrl), SGR2a, or JFH-1 RNA for 48 h. DDX3X interplays with multiple cellular compartments and HCV elements. mechanisms underlying these DDX3X-mediated effects remain elusive. DDX3X interacts with and recruits IKK- to the SGs, leading to its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation through an unidentified mechanism. DDX3X\u2013IKK- activation take place at the stress granules but not in other subcellular organelles, such as the autophagosome, mitochondria, peroxisome, or lipid droplets. stress granules are cytoplasmic macromolecular structures of stalled translation initiation complexes that are induced in response to various stress conditions. formation of SGs is driven by aggregation of several key RNA binding proteins, such as TIA-1, TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) and TIAR subsequently are deficient in SG formation (34\u201336) two recent studies showed that the assembly and disassembly of SGs is a highly dynamic (oscillating) process in HCV-infected cells (30, 44) SG formation is associated with delayed cell division, stalled translation, and prolonged cell survival. this suggests that HCV exploits this important stress response to establish persistent infection in hepatocytes (30) the relocation of SGs to LDs at the late step of viral infection also has been reported by Ariumi et al. DDX3X has been shown to interact with HCV core protein, but this interaction is dispensable for productive HCV infection. depletion of DDX3X or the SG component G3BP1 or TIA paralogs significantly reduced viral RNA levels in cells. this effect was further supported by the presence of HCV nonstructural proteins in the DDX3X-SG complex in the context of either full-length or subgenomic HCV replicon transfection. the core protein promotes the accumulation of LDs to facilitate virus assembly. it has been proposed that HCV core protein recruits nonstructural proteins, mainly NS5A, viral RNA, and the RC- to LD-associated membranes."}
