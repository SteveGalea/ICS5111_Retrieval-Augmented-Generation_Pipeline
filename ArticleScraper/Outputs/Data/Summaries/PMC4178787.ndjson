{"summary": "IAV targets the airway epithelium in the human respiratory tract to initiate the infection, causing an acute febrile respiratory illness commonly known as flu. to counter the infection, epithelial cells impose restrictions on various steps of the IAV life cycle. acetylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins and has been studied extensively in histones to gain understanding of chromatin structure and gene transcription. acetylation is now known to occur in a variety of mammalian proteins. a proteomic study has identified at least 3,600 acetylation sites in 1,750 nuclear and nonnuclear proteins. a549 and MDCK cells were grown and maintained in complete minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and titrated on MDCK cells. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail) membranes were probed with rabbit anti-HDAC6 (1:200; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-NP (1:1,000 predesigned small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides targeting the HDAC6 gene were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNAiMax-siRNA complex was then mixed with 2 105 cells and transferred to 12-well plates. HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 10% dithiothreitol, and 0.04% bromophenol blue were infected with 10-fold serial dilution of the culture medium. the viral inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with serum-free MEM containing 1 g/ml TPCK-trypsin and 0.8% Avicel. cells were fixed in 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. cells were stained with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin antibody (1:100) followed by Alexa 594-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100; Invitrogen) cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-NP (1:50 fluorescent images were acquired by sequential scanning on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope. Acquired images were analyzed in Zen software (Zeiss) or ImageJ, version 1.48v (NIH), or exported as TIFF files. a threshold of 150 was set for both red and green channels to reduce nonspecific noise in the images. acetylated -tubulin or viral NP was detected in respective samples by WB using mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin antibody or goat anti-NP antibody. the proteins were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. total lysate of the infected cells was prepared, and HDAC6 acetylated -tubulin, viral NP, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were detected by WB. NP and PDI were detected as the infection marker and loading control, respectively. cells were either mock treated (Tubacin) or treated with 10 M tubacin (+Tubacin) cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin. cells were stained with goat anti-HA followed by Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody. tion of HDAC6 activity promotes IAV infection. A549 cells (4 105) were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1.0 for 24 h. cell lysates were then prepared, and immunoprecipitation was carried out. total acetylated -tubulin in the lysate was detected by IP with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin and WB with the same antibody using a Quick Western kit reagent. the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and titrated on MDCK cells. serum-free MEM was added, and cells were incubated again at 35\u00b0C. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail) membranes were probed with rabbit anti-HDAC6 (1:200; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-tubulin (1:1,000; Sigma 4 105 cells were grown to 80 to 90% confluence in 12-well culture plates. plasmid DNA and 2 l of Lipofectamine 2000 were diluted separately in OptiMEM I medium (Invitrogen), mixed together, and incubated for 20 to 30 min at room temperature. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex was then added to the cells. the mixture was then centrifuged at 20,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the pellet was air dried and washed twice with ice-cold acetone. confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were infected with serial dilutions. the number of virions per micrometer of the plasma membrane was calculated from the 4.1- by 5.5-m-diameter images of multiple cells. cells were fixed in 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. cells were stained with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin antibody (1:100) followed by Alexa 594-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody cells were stained with goat anti-COP antibody, followed by Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. cells were stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst (5 g/ml; Invitrogen), and coverslips were mounted in mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 1 h. beads were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. proteins were released from beads by incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. the virion yield in the culture medium was measured by WB of viral NP (A) and by microplaque assay on MDCK cells (B). total lysate of the infected cells was prepared, and HDAC6, acetylated -tubulin, viral NP, and protein disulfide isomerase were detected by WB. A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1.0 and mock treated (Tubacin) or treated with 10 M tubacin (+Tubacin) after 24 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin followed by Alexa 594-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. cells were stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst and analyzed by conf ten thousand cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. data are presented as means standard errors of the means (n = 3). Mock, mock infected cells were prepared and stained with goat anti-HA. (8 105) were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1.0 for 24 h. total acetylated -tubulin in the lysate was detected by IP with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin. RESULTS Ectopically expressed HDAC6 inhibits IAV infection. the overexpression of HDAC6 in the cells was confirmed by WB. a noticeable deacetylation of the acetylated -tubulin in HDAC6-overexpressing cells compared to the vector-only control confirmed that ectopically expressed HDAC6 was enzymatically active. the transfection efficiency of A549 cells is shown in Fig. 1D. deacetylase activity plays a role in the antiviral property of HDAC6. tubacin binds to one of the two HDAC6 catalytic domains (a feature unique to HDAC6). tubacin treatment increased the release of infectious virions in the medium. a 3.5-fold increase in the virion release was observed from tubacin-treated cells compared to untreated cells. to further analyze the effect of HDAC6 inhibition on IAV infection, PR8-infected cells were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM) IAV enters host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, replicates its RNA genome in the nucleus, and assembles its progeny on the plasma membrane (22) for virion assembly, all viral components need to be transported to the plasma membrane. acetylation of microtubules has been shown to promote the vesicular transport. increased intracellular acetylated -tubulin level in IAV-infected cells occurs between 6 and 12 h of infection. acetylated -tubulin level due to HDAC6 depletion and tubacin treatment corresponds with the decrease in intracellular NP level. a basal level of acetylated microtubules was visualized in mock-treated cells. but in tubacin-treated cells, acetylated microtubules mediate the trafficking of viral HA. a single-cell population of PR8-infected cells was prepared, stained for HA. vRNP complex was visualized by staining for vRNP constituents NP and PB2. vRNPs were more or less evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of infected cells as punctate structures. acetylated microtubule filaments were colocalized with acetylated microtubules. a 93% pixel overlap between NP and acetylated microtubules indicates the validity of the method used to quantitate the colocalization of vRNP with acetylated microtubules. cytoplasmic vRNPs were redistributed toward the cell periphery in tubacin-treated cells. acetylated microtubules mediate the trafficking of nonmembrane IAV components. vRNPs colocalize with acetylated microtubules. MDCK cells were either mock infected (A and B) or infected with PR8. ectopically expressed HDAC6 inhibits IAV infection in cells overexpressing human HDAC6. cells were transfected with an HDAC6-expressing plasmid or the empty vector. the culture medium and the infected cells were harvested separately. a549 cells with ectopically expressed HDAC6 produce less IAV progeny. the cells transfected with an HDAC6-targeting siRNA released more total virions. a more prominent double band of viral NP was detected after depletion of HDAC6. tubacin is a specific and cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of HDAC6. tubacin binds to one of the two HDAC6 catalytic domains. a549 cells were infected with PR8 and subsequently treated with various concentrations of tubacin. tubacin treatment increased release of total and infectious viral progeny in the medium. PR8-infected cells were examined by thin-section electron microscopy. no obvious defects in the IAV morphology were observed after tubacin treatment. spherical virions can be visualized on surface of tubacin-treated cells. the acetylation of microtubules has been shown to promote the vesicular transport (23, 24) therefore, to inhibit IAV infection, HDAC6 potentially impedes the trafficking of viral components to the plasma membrane. MDCK cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.5 and harvested after 0, 6, 12, and 24 h of infection. acetylated -tubulin, total -tubulin, viral NP, and actin (as a loading control) were detected by WB. acetylated microtubules mediate the trafficking of viral HA and, potentially, of all envelope components to the plasma membrane. a single-cell population of PR8-infected cells was prepared, stained for HA. a single-cell population of PR8-infected cells was prepared, stained for HA. PR8-infected cells were stained for vRNP complex and acetylated microtubules. we found that vRNPs were more or less evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of infected cells as punctate structures. many punctate structures were colocalized with acetylated microtubules. cytoplasmic vRNPs were redistributed toward the cell periphery in tubacin-treated cells. about 36% of the cells showed a vRNP shift toward the cell periphery after tubacin treatment. acetylated microtubules mediate the trafficking of vRNPs, too. cells shown in panels A to E were stained with mouse anti-acetylated -tubulin antibody followed by Alexa 594-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-NP antibody. cells were then analyzed by confocal microscopy. we were unable to detect the endogenous HDAC6 in MDCK cells. several interferon-induced host restriction factors have been shown to restrict IAV infection. however, in response to IAV infection, HDAC6 activity is downregulated. microtubules are the main cellular organelles that mediate anterograde and retrograde cargo transport in the cell. vRNP traffics via the Rab11 GTPase-mediated vesicular transport pathway. this pathway is closely linked to the microtubules. acetylation was the second posttranslational modification of -tubulin to be discovered after detyrosination (37). acetylation promotes vesicular transport by promoting the binding of kinesin and dynein motor proteins to microtubules. enhanced acetylation of microtubules rescued the vesicular transport defect in Huntington's disease (24). acetylated -tubulin, acetylated cortactin, and acetylated -catenin could be the other potential effectors of the anti-IAV function of HDAC6. cortactin is an actin-binding protein and promotes actin polymerization and branching. acetylation regulates actin-binding ability of cortactin (18) efforts are being mobilized to develop HDAC6 modulators for the treatment of relevant diseases. as an alternative anti-IAV approach, HDAC6 stimulators may be employed to stimulate the anti-IAV potential of endogenous HDAC6 to restrict IAV infection."}
