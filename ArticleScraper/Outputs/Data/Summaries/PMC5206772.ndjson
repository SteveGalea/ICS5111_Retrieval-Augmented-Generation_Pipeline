{"summary": "two prominent viruses \u2013 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have markedly affected humans. H1N1, since the 2009 pandemic, has caused about 284,500 deaths. diabetes is one of the known documented contributing host-related risk factor in both H1N1 and MERS-CoV severe cases. many infected individuals exhibit comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity), rendering them more susceptible to complications. a total of 44 peer-reviewed original studies were selected for full text review. full article review resulted in the further exclusion of 8 reports that were not documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV. a bibliography search of the remaining articles identified two additional studies. data extracted from selected studies included the first author\u2019s name, publication date, country, dates of recruitment, ethnicity, total sample size (divided to males and females), age, prevalence of symptoms (including fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHEII) weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities. the meta-analysis of proportions (and 95% CIs) was calculated for the identified studies (Figure 3) and in a subgroup analysis within each region. we used binary random-effects model since we assumed the relationship between diabetes and severe respiratory infection is varied across populations. ath Sore Throat Cough Obesity HT/ CAD/ CVD Imm/ HIV Al-Soub et al. 20143 Qatar 07.09-01.11 40 24 16 42.7 12 90 75 23 88 28 40 3 3 3 Allam et al., 20134 India 05.09-12.10 45 24 21 18 80 16 18 3 2 Bagshaw et al., 201315 Canada 04.09-04.10 562 262 300 48 21 27 67 42.5 22 29 12 3 Marija Kojicic et al., 201224 BAH 11.09-03.10 50 31 29 43 19 16 64 5 6 2 Miller et al., 201225 USA 05.09-06.09 43 8 35 36.4 60 63 16 73 7 2 Wane et al., 201226 Rwanda 10.09-05.10 532 257 275 42 85 33 58 88 2 3 Chudasama et al., 201127 94 47 30 92 38 2 CDC, 200938 USA-AB 04.09-12.09 416 44.5 1 Kwan-Gett et al., 200939 USA 04.09-08.09 70 37 33 11 41 11 16 2 Total/Weighted Average (SD) 04.09-02.11 92,948 46,181 46,351 36.2(6.0) 20.2(4.5) 82.5(9.1) 53.3(7.3) 38.9(6.2) 85.9 assiri et al., 20137 09.12-06.13 47 36 11 64.5 87 72 21 83 17 62 4 Memish et al., 201343 7 0 7 43 57 57 29 2 WHO, 201344 09.12-10.13 161 104 57 50 7.5 5 3 Total/Weighted Average (SD) 09.12-06.14 308 199 109 54.3(7.4) 28 78.0(8.8) 7 0.043 8.6 0.003 88.3 North America15,19,22,25,28,32,34,36,38,39 5,294 19.7 (13.8-25.6) 0.008 166.7 0.001 94.6. the search resulted in 123 articles selected for title and abstract review. a total of 38 peer-reviewed articles were identified for this article. a total of 38 unique studies were identified for this article. quality scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were considered poor, fair, good and very good respectively. data extraction and analysis Data extracted from selected studies included the first author\u2019s name, publication date, country, dates of recruitment, ethnicity, total sample size (divided to males and females), age, prevalence of symptoms (including fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHEII) T-test was used to compare between average age in H1N1 and MERS-CoV. this factor was normally distributed in the two sets of studies. to assess whether there is true heterogeneity among the selected studies. 04.09-04.10 562 262 300 48 21 27 2 Balaganesakumar et al., 201316 India 01.10-12.10 72 41 31 45.5 96 85 60 88 24 9 3 Chawla et al., 20135 India 10.09-12.10 77 44 33 40.9 97 77 33 87 25 8 3 Jimenez-Garcia et al., 201317 Spain 01.09-12.09 11,499 5806 5693 39. 2 3 Chudasama et al., 201127 India 09.09-02.10 274 141 133 29.5 92 53 54 97 9 5 4 Gilca et al., 201128 Canada 04.09-06.09 321 154 167 29 25 13 8 3 Ward et al., 201129 Australia 07.09-08.09 302 125 177 45 35 14 10 3 Yokota et al., 201130 Brazil 07.09 157 78 APACHEII, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; HT, CAD, CVD, hypertension, coronary artery diseases, cardiovascular diseases; Imm, immunodeficiency.

MERS-CoV cases were significantly older (54.37.4 years) than their H1N1 counterparts. the average age of H1N1 patients is similar to that in H5N1 cases where 90 percent of the subjects were 40 years or younger. lower prevalence of obesity in males from the Arabian Peninsula versus females69 may have been combined to render the occurrence of obesity in MERS-CoV non-significantly different from that in H1N1. the increased risk of developing severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV complications in people with underlying chronic diseases was similarly reported in seasonal influenza. diabetes frequency in H1N1 cases from Asia and North America is 2-fold higher than in those from Europe and South America. this coincides with the high prevalence of diabetes in Asia and North America (12%) compared to Europe or South and Central America (9%). however, despite the lines of evidence suggesting an influence of the region of viral spread on diabetes proportion in the severe cases of SARI, the rate of diabetes in MERS-CoV was still 3-fold higher than that in the H1N1 cases from Asia. innate immunity and the shift from Th1 to Th2 responses were implicated in linking the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections. diabetes can impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response76. levels of HbA1c 9% were linked to a 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization due to a lower immune response. heterogeneous methodologies due to different study designs may have influenced the inter-study variation. this observation may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of diabetes to severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. the study provides some evidence of a greater prevalence of diabetes to MERS-CoV severity compared to H1N1. this should be viewed as a key public health strategy in preventing SARI-associated morbidity and mortality. for a 90% rate to all elderly people (65 years of age) and 60% for younger people who have risk factors (e.g., diabetes) the prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in middle- and low-income countries."}
