{"summary": "the international centre for medical researches of Franceville (CIRMF) was founded in 1974 by his Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba and Mr. Pierre Guillaumat. the centre was inaugurated on December 5th, 1979 with the participation of numerous internationally eminent scientists. in the 1990s, viral hemorrhagic fevers became a focus of attention in Equatorial. a second high security laboratory for Risk Group 3/4 Agents was built between 2003 and 2008 on CIRMF campus. this laboratory was commissioned by a combined team of experts from the pasteur Institute of Paris, National Institute of Health and Medical Research, France, and Jean M\u00e9rieux P4 laboratory of Lyon. the present high containment and high security laboratory, operated by the Emerging Viral Diseases Unit, is one of 2 laboratories in Africa that can manipulate Risk Group 3/4 Agents. the Primate Center houses more than 450 primates belonging to ten different African species. researchers study ecological approaches to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, inter-species transmission of pathogens, and disease outbreaks in humans and wild animals. facilities On 45 hectares, the CIRMF campus has a working space of 2,500 square meters composed of a main building, laboratories, service buildings, and living accommodations. the present high containment and high security laboratory, operated by the Emerging Viral Diseases Unit (UMVE), is one of 2 laboratories in Africa that can manipulate Risk Group 3/4 Agents. ills (Mandrillus sphinx), collared mangabeys (Cercopithecus nictitans), greater spot-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and an Asian macaque (Macaca sp.) colony are housed in large open-air facilities. training technical laboratory training support of Gabonese teams and other African countries has been one of the major aims of CIRMF. the UMVE actively participates in the academic training at the regional graduate school and the different State universities of Equatorial Africa. Continuing medical education in form of post-doctoral workshops are held at the CIRMF for discussion and demonstration of modern techniques. the emerging viral diseases unit, CIRMF, proposes forming a research partnership to study infectious diseases transmitted by animals of the tropical rain forests regions of Equatorial Africa. the proposed partnership builds on existing collaborations of several years between the major research centers of 2 other French speaking Equatorial African countries. an international partnership with the IRD, Marseille, France, and the Institute of Virology, Bonn, Germany, will assist in the development of this regional partnership. the UVME assists the national public health system in consolidating and formalizing microbiological monitoring of the Equatorial African sub-region. a strategic choice was made to link syndromes to an etiological agent, including hemorrhagic syndromes. a progressive and diversified methodology was applied. we characterized the viral variants associated with all Ebola virus disease outbreaks that occurred between 1996 and 2008. the identification of multiple variants during the 2001 Gabon/Republic of Congo outbreak and two phylogenetically divergent lineages suggest independent introduction into great ape and human populations. a viral protein with super-antigen activity might be involved in the massive T cell apoptosis. effective control of Ebola virus infection is associated with balanced immune responses in survivors. a large fraction of the human population living in forested areas of Gabon has both humoral and cellular immunity to Ebola virus.

Continuing medical education in form of post-doctoral workshops are held at the CIRMF. Continuing medical education in the form of post-doctoral workshops are held at the CIRMF for discussion and demonstration of modern techniques. an international partnership with the IRD, Marseille, France, and the Institute of Virology, Bonn, Germany, will assist in the development of this regional partnership. the UMVE-CIRMF field team participates along with other international partners to respond to all Ebola virus disease epidemics in Africa. CIRMF diagnosed infections of more than 70 pathogens that could not be identified in other biology laboratories throughout the country. the capital of Gabon, Libreville, is part of the CIRMF operational system. CIRMF aims to use laboratory and field expertise as a regional focal resource in conjunction with local health authorities to organize epidemic responses. an informal international laboratory network for the diagnosis and surveillance of severe infectious clinical syndromes includes: the Institut national de recherche biom\u00e9dicale, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Laboratoire National de Sant\u00e9 Publique de Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. UMVE studied the factors implicated in the three steps that led to Ebola virus and Marburg virus diseases emergence in humans. these steps include the identification of reservoir species, the circulation within the natural host, and finally the direct transmission to humans from great apes and fruit bats. antibodies and nucleotide sequences specific for Marburg virus were found in the liver and spleen of fruit bat belonging to three species. disease outbreaks would occur episodically during certain ecological conditions caused by habitat disturbances or climatic phenomena. asymptomatic infection was associated with an early strong inflammatory response that may be involved in the early inhibition of viral replication [16,17]. high prevalence of 'immune' individuals suggests a common source of human exposure such as fruits contaminated by bat saliva. UMVE science policy was redirected since 2007 by expanding the main research themes to emerging viral diseases that could threaten public health in the Congo basin.
