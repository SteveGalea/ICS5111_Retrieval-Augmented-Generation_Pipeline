{"summary": "viruses have evolved mRNAs that are translated by alternative mechanisms. other viruses encode nucleases that specifically degrade host mRNAs. others produce mRNAs that can, by nature of their extraordinary translation efficiency, outcompete most cellular mRNAs (8\u201310) 2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins required for viral replication and inactivation of antiviral cellular pathways (12\u201314) neither structural nor nonstructural proteins are known to modify or compete with the cellular translation machinery. earlier studies report little to no effect of DENV infection on total host cell protein synthesis (15, 16) DENV replication is highly sensitive to silencing or knockout of host factors functioning in protein translocation and/or processing in the ER (26\u201328). virions assemble and bud into the ER lumen, utilizing the secretory pathway to exit the cell (12). virions paired ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with biochemical cell fractionation. transcriptome-wide changes in translation of host genes during DENV infection included both UPR and IFN response pathways. previously identified essential host factors for DENV infection are not translationally upregulated during infection but rather are generally repressed. the deNV 10.7-kb plus-strand RNA encodes both cytosolic and integral membrane proteins. hepatocarcinoma cells were infected with DENV (serotype 2; strain new Guinea-C) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. after 1 h, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells cultured for 6, 12, 24, or 40 h postinfection. at each time point, cells were fractionated using a sequential detergent-based fractionation method (Fig. 1A) the RNA component of the two subcellular fractions was analyzed by ribosome profiling (35) to assess mRNA translation status and RNA-seq to profile mRNA transcriptome composition. total RNA was isolated from each fraction and analyzed by RNA-seq to assess gene expression. the relative levels of the DENV plus strand were approximately an order of magnitude higher than those of the DENV minus strand throughout infection. we calculated the relative rates of minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis from the changes in RNA levels. each cell was likely exposed to 1,000 DENV genomes, many of which could be defective in typical infections. translation efficiency distributions of host mRNAs encoding TMHMM-predicted ER-targeted proteins are shown in black. the translation efficiency distribution is calculated as an average value of all mRNAs at all time points. both minus- and plus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the ER. translation efficiency of cytosolic plus-strand RNA was low throughout the experimental time course. intriguingly, for ER-bound DENV plus-strand RNA, translation efficiency is relatively low at the 6-h time point but increases by 12 h postinfection, where it is sustained. this period of relatively low translation efficiency on the ER overlaps with the period of high minus-strand synthesis rates. this transition may reflect a regulated transition from a primarily circularized, replication- ribosome profiling reads over the 10.3-kb coding DNA sequence (CDS) at each time point in the experimental time course of infection. the ribosome distribution pattern was largely unchanged over the experimental time course. synthesis of a composite balance of structural and nonstructural proteins is sustained throughout the infection cycle. ribosome densities are lowest in the intragenic region encoding capsid. ribosome densities are highest for the regions encoding NS2B, NS4B, and NS5. variations in ribosome density could arise through cis-encoded translational regulation. ribosome profiling reads mapping to the UTR, particularly the 3\u2032 UTR, were also obtained (Fig. 3A) but they were at a much lower density, and their size distribution was discernibly different from those of other genes. they represent nuclease protection by means other than ribosomes. the sfRNA is derived from the DENV 3\u2032 UTR. deNV infection resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the translation of host ER-targeted mRNAs. the levels of mRNAs coding for both ER-targeted and cytosolic proteins decreased somewhat over the course infection. ribosome loading and overall mRNA levels contribute to a reduction of total translation on the ER. ER-bound ribosomes translating topogenic signal-coding mRNAs. cytosol-encoding mRNAs were only modestly altered. cytoplasmic protein-encoding mRNAs are broadly represented on the ER. NV on ER-associated translation was restricted to ER-associated secretory/membrane protein-encoding mRNAs. the polyprotein translation product would be expected to compete with the translation products of host ER-targeted mRNAs for access to the protein translocation machinery. we further examined the impact of DENV infection on the translation of ER-targeted host mRNAs. plus-strand RNA ribosome abundance values at 40 h exceed the ribosome abundance of ER-targeted host mRNAs at the zero time point. de novo protein synthesis is a direct measure of de novo protein synthesis. radiolabeled band of ca. 100 kDa is predicted to be highly enriched in the cytosol fraction. radiolabeled band of ca. 68 kDa is present in the ER fraction and absent from the cytosol fraction of DENV-infected cells. immunoblot analyses of deNV capsid, envelope, prM, NS2B, NS3 and NS5 expression and subcellular localization were performed. the immunoblot studies were consistent with the data depicted in Fig. 5E. the majority of changes in host mRNA translation in response to DENV represent a conserved, progressive response that increases in magnitude over the time course of infection. genes are sorted by their mean response over the time course of infection. the translational response to IFN-1A treatment is also indicated. induction was quite slow and modest, more consistent with a supportive role for the UPR, e.g., expansion of ER secretory capacity, rather than an acute, proteostatic stress response (16, 69, 70) there remained a substantial cohort of mRNAs (433) whose translation was enhanced during DENV infection but not by IFN or UPR. primarily ER-resident proteins (27, 28) examined how DENV infection affects expression of high-confidence DENV host factors. this analysis revealed many of the CRISPR-identified essential host factors to be translationally downregulated. host genes were, on average, unchanged (Fig. 7A) the list of log2 change in translation for CRISPR-identified essential genes for DENV2 was determined in Marceau et al. (27), with a RIGER score of >1 after 40 h of infection. the ER localization status of each gene product is also indicated. digitonin-extracted cells are treated with n-dodecyl-d-maltoside (DDM)-supplemented buffers to release ER-associated cellular components. rRNAs (ribosomes) were recovered in both fractions, showing a modest ER enrichment in mock-infected cells. total RNA was isolated from each fraction and analyzed by RNA-seq. polysomes in each fraction were nuclease digested, and ribosome footprints were isolated and analyzed by Ribo-seq. the peak rate of increase for the plus-strand RNA occurred between 12 and 24 h postinfection, with a doubling time of 20 min (3.8 min) each cell was likely exposed to 1,000 DENV genomes. the pattern of change in minus-strand RNA levels differed markedly from those of plus-strand RNA. minus- and plus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the ER. both minus- and plus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the ER. this finding may reflect localization of the minus strand to the ER-associated replication center and association with ER-associated template plus strand. translation efficiency is relatively low at the 6-h time point but increases by 12 h postinfection, where it is sustained. this period of relatively low translation efficiency on the ER overlaps with the period of high minus-strand synthesis rates. this transition may reflect a regulated transition from a primarily circularized, replication-dedicated plus-strand structure to a linearized, translationally competent structure, as suggested previously. the ribosome distribution pattern was largely unchanged over the experimental time course, suggesting that synthesis of a composite balance of structural and nonstructural proteins is sustained throughout the infection cycle. ribosome densities are lowest in the intragenic region encoding capsid and highest for the regions encoding capsid. variations in ribosome densities could arise through cis-encoded translational regulation, perhaps coupled to the ordered cotranslational proteolytic processing of the DENV polyprotein into individual proteins. variations in ribosome density may also reflect a molecular strategy to compensate for differential stabilities of the processed proteins. a large number of RNA-seq reads mapped to the 3\u2032 UTR. the sfRNA is derived from the DENV 3\u2032 UTR. the coding sequence is indicated by the gray shaded area. the sfRNA is derived from the DENV 3\u2032 UTR. the levels of mRNAs coding for both ER-targeted and cytosolic proteins decreased slightly over the course infection. the Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses thus indicate that reductions in both ribosome loading and overall mRNA levels contribute to a reduction of total translation on the ER. ER-bound ribosomes translating nontopogenic signal-encoding mRNAs (i.e., cytosol-encoding host mRNA) and DENV plus-strand RNA. cells were infected with DENV for 36 h and then pulse labeled with [35S]Met/Cys. bands appearing for samples from the DENV-infected samples are presumed to be DENV proteins. reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values for ER-targeted host mRNAs were multiplied by corresponding ORF length to provide a measure of gene-specific ribosome abundance. this transformation accounts for the fact that ribosome loading is, in general, a function of ORF length; longer ORFs tend to be more populated with ribosomes. [35S]Met/Cys pulse labeling provides an orthogonal test of the ribosome footprinting data. it distinguishes between translating and translationally suppressed polyribosomes. this approach also reveals differences in the translational status of the cytosol and ER compartments. cytosol fraction of infected cells was radiolabeled band of ca. 100 kDa. the radiolabeled protein of ca. 68 kDa is present in the ER fraction. NS3 lacks a signal sequence or transmembrane domain (65), it would be predicted to reside in the cytosol. t studies were consistent with the data depicted in Fig. 5E. the [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeling and DENV protein immunoblot data illustrate that DENV primarily commandeers ER translocon-associated ribosomes. analyses of the relative distribution of ER-bound ribosomes engaged in the translation of DENV plus-strand RNA and ER-targeted mRNAs reveal a slow process of ribosome capture changes in the interferon-induced-only gene set and the UPR-induced gene set increased at least 50% after 4 h of UPR induction. the genes increased at least 100% in total translation after 40 h of DENV infection. the changes were determined for biological processes using GOrilla. gene ontology analysis of the 433 DENV-only genes revealed the most significant biological processes are linked to the Gene Ontology (GO) categories autophagy, regulation of cell cycle, signal transduction, and cellular metabolism. most transcriptome-wide changes in total translation were driven by changes in translational efficiency. PR-identified essential host factors to be translationally downregulated, whereas host genes were, on average, unchanged. non-ER-resident CRISPR-identified host factors did not have a particular bias for up- or downregulation (5 genes and 4 genes, respectively) a RIGER score of >1, after 40 h of infection is indicated. the ER localization status of each gene product is also indicated. the fundamental question of how DENV competes for host cell translation capacity is largely unknown. minus-strand RNA synthesis drops and is replaced by two primary functions: robust translation of plus-strand RNA and rapid synthesis of additional plus-strand RNA from the now-abundant minus-strand template. the critical processes of DENV protein and RNA synthesis are contingent upon the virus's ability to co-opt the structure and activity of the ER. inefficient translation could serve as a \u201ckinetic trap\u201d and divert ribosomes from host mRNAs to the DENV plus-strand RNA translation. inefficient translation as an adaptive feature would allow for abundant plus-strand RNA for virion production while avoiding deleterious levels of UPR activation. the impact that DENV has specifically on host ER translation is large and broadly inhibitory. these findings bear similarity to those recently reported by Roth and coworkers (78), the two studies differ in conclusions regarding the overall magnitude of the translational inhibition observed in response to DENV infection. the exception to the trend of suppressed translation hint at an important role for translational regulation of host mRNAs by DENV itself. subset of genes is generally related to regulation of catabolic processes. these biological processes ultimately favor viral replication and virion production. specific genes found in the DENV-only category may be used most directly by the virus during its life cycle and could comprise therapeutic targets. host factors that are translationally activated during infection may impact viral success at later stages of infection (i.e., when an individual is already infected) this proposed bimodal evaluation of host factors will require experimental validation but may provide an opportunity for insight into the questions of how and when a host factor contributes to the viral life cycle. for 1 h, the virus inocula were removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 12 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and replaced with prewarmed complete media. interferon treatment was performed using recombinant IFN-1A (Millipore) centrifugation through a 0.5 M sucrose cushion in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge using the TLA100.2 rotor (24 min, 90,000 rpm). rRNA was isolated and subsequently treated with polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) each of the RNA fragment pools was converted into a cDNA library. Huh7 cells were mock infected or DENV infected (MOI of 10) and fractionated into cytoplasmic and ER fractions as described above. samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. proteins were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and the same volume of lysate for each compartment was separated on a 4 to 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Novex) the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and expressed proteins were detected using antibodies against C, prM, E, NS1, NS2B, NS4B, or NS5 (Genetex) the most abundant isoform of each gene was selected and compiled into a reference transcriptome. reads within the coding sequence were counted and normalized by coding sequence length and library size. sfRNA levels were determined via the equation (3\u2032 UTR read density/CDS read density) RPKM (DENV CDS) cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. titers were determined by standard vero focus-forming assay. cell-based titers were calculated using vero cell-based titers. lysates were diluted to 100 mM KOAc and treated with 10 g/ml micrococcal nuclease for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. rRNA was precipitated by addition of NAOAc to 300 mM and 300 l ethanol. rRNA was depleted using RiboZero (Illumina) the RNA pellet was resuspended in a 10-l solution containing 10 mM ATP, 10 U polynucleotide kinase and 1 PNK buffer. the solution was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. cDNA libraries were amplified using 16 cycles of PCR and then pooled and sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) antisera were generated by immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-synthetic peptide conjugates. cells were plated at 3 105 cells per well in a six-well dish and infected the following day with DENV2-NGC at an MOI of 10. infection was allowed to carry on for 36 h, and then cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and ER fractions. proteins were separated on a 4 to 12% acrylamide gel (Novex) and dried. gels were phosphorimaged using a GE Typhoon Trio. reads were first trimmed of their 3\u2032 adapters using Cutadapt. changes in ribosome loading are inferred to contribute the remainder of the fold change. all sequencing data are available under Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number."}
